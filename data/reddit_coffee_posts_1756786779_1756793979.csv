1n6byzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1n6byzh/titrated_up_on_xywav_and_had_a_terrible_reaction/,Titrated up on Xywav and had a terrible reaction…,"(This might also fall under rant/rave, sorry! this is my first ever reddit post)

For background I (24F) was diagnosed with narcolepsy in August 2024 and I’m a nurse who works “12hr shifts” (6:45a-7:15p if I leave on time, which I don’t always get) at a psych hospital. I take 50mg Vyvanse & 75mg Sunosi every morning (which the specialty pharmacy checked for contraindications before I could get approved for Xywav), and I started Xywav last week. I did not have the most pleasant results with my starting dose (which I might document in a different post) of 2.5g twice a night (5g nightly total), but despite my not great results I was urged by my RN case manager (who was assigned to me by the specialty pharmacy that I get the Xywav through) to keep trying it out because, “if anyone needs a good nights sleep, it’s you.” (That’s a direct quote lol) She explained to me that I can’t eat for 2hrs before the medication or it doesn’t absorb properly and after taking it on an empty stomach and sleeping really weird I didn’t want to find out what eating and taking it would be like. She also told me that I cannot drive for 6hrs after taking the second dose, but I have to leave for work at 6:15am which means I can’t take my second dose later than 12:15am and my first dose has to be 2.5-4hrs before that, 2.5hrs being 9:45pm, and 2hrs before that is 7:45pm, which is a terribly inconvenient time to be eating because I’m usually driving, walking out to my car, or even still at work if it’s a particular hectic day on the unit. I also have to account for the time it takes for me to walk from my unit to my car. All that to say, it’s just a difficult time to eat dinner. My fear of eating earlier in the shift is that if I eat too early it won’t be dinner any more and I’ll be hungry and grumpy the whole time before bed and end up going to bed crazy early and not get to spend any time with my boyfriend or do pretty much anything when I get off work except go home and go to bed. The other thing is in the morning I don’t usually eat breakfast because it is very inconvenient and usually makes me late for work, plus I have Invisalign so I try to be strategic about when I eat to make sure I have time to also brush my teeth before I put my tray back in. 
And I don’t always get a lunch because that’s just being a nurse in the American healthcare system baby! Lol
So anyway, my prescription is to titrate up to 3g twice a night (6g nightly total) from the starting dose after 7 nights, which I did last night. However, as a nurse I do a lot of taking care of other people and not myself, and I really wanted to not mess with this medications absorption by eating—to make this next part easier Today is Monday (Labor Day)— Saturday night I ate dinner around 7:30pm, took my 2.5g dose 1 @9:45, second dose around 12:15am (I hadn’t been having trouble waking up the next morning with this dose so I felt comfortable taking it approximately 6hrs before I had to drive to work), then I got up Sunday morning @5:35am and took Vyvanse and Sunosi like I always do and went to work at 6:20am, work was VERY BUSY and I didn’t get a chance to eat the entire day and when I did I was distracted by stuff I probably could’ve asked for help with but I forgot because Vyvanse suppresses my hunger so I wasn’t thinking about being hungry. I ended up getting off late Sunday because it was one of those particularly hectic days I mentioned and I didn’t get to eat, and I knew I was titrating up Sunday evening and I was scheduled to work today (Monday) so I just didn’t eat, I took my med at 9:55 because I was finishing an episode of a show and lost track of time, and set my alarms accordingly. The entire time I was falling asleep after the first dose I was convinced my partner felt like he was stuck with me and annoyed about it (he was not, he was literally asleep). I then slept VERY HARD and woke up to one of backup second dose alarms going off and the room was spinning, so I didn’t take the second dose until 12:38am, and had the stroke of genius to tell house supervisor that I might be coming in late due to medication problems. As I was falling asleep after my second dose, I felt my breathing get REALLY REALLY SLOW & LABORED, my hands and feet and face all felt cold and tingly and I had a sudden sense of impending doom so I said to my partner between slow, deep breaths, “Love, I’m scared… …My hands, feet, and face… …are so cold… …it’s hard to breathe… …if I die in my sleep… …tell everyone I love them.” And then I fell asleep. I’m sure he loved that!!

Monday morning (today) I woke up to my partner muttering gibberish, except it wasn’t gibberish, it was words but I couldn’t process them for another few seconds when he repeated “please turn off your alarm.” And my eyes opened and the room began spinning and I felt simultaneously drunk and hungover all at once and it was hard to breathe. I called (night) house supervisor to let them know I’d be late, but that I am going to try to be there by 8am. Then I had to crawl on all fours to the bathroom where I waited for my vision to go back to normal, I decided a shower might help so I took what felt like forever (my partner informed me it was really only 45min) sitting in the shower trying breathing exercises, and checking if I could see again by trying to read my shampoo bottle’s directions. Once I could read again, and the room wasn’t spinning like crazy, I decided I felt well enough to drive to work, but spent the entire time getting ready for work feeling an insane level of anxiety. I took my Vyvanse & Sunosi around 7am but decided since I had already called in late I was going to grab breakfast and an apology Starbucks drink for my coworker. So I went to Starbucks and got my apology drink for my coworker, and myself some breakfast and a pink drink, which I later remembered had caffeine in it so I barely drank it (side note: I don’t drink coffee bc I think it’s yucky or caffeine at all bc it makes me kinda sleepy). I got to work @8:07am (close enough to on time lol) but I was still feeling kinda dizzy if I moved my head too fast. I ate part of my breakfast but didn’t get to finish because I got very busy, I was feeling very guilty for being late because I knew we had pretty high acuity patients and being short staffed on top of that sucks, and the egg got cold so it stopped being yummy. I had left my water bottle in the break room so when I started getting heart palpitations and still didn’t feel quite right I went to the back to drink some water, one of the psychiatrists I work with came to the back and when she saw me she asked me “are you okay? You look a little unwell” I told her my situation, then she asked “do you need anything?” I started crying and said “I don’t know.” she recommended I go home and rest, I told her I wanted to try to hydrate first and if I wasn’t feeling better then I would, she left. Before I could even go back out to the floor (day) house supervisor called and asked if I was alright, I tried explaining the situation to her but I forgot that it was a new person because it’s the same phone that called me and she said I sounded mentally unwell and needed to get someone to pick me up. My mom and grandma came to get me and I stayed at my mom’s all day while I tried to eat small, frequent meals with carbs and protein, drink water regularly and monitor my own vital signs— I was panicking about whether or not I needed to go to the ER because “what if I’m experiencing something that could cause a hypoxemic brain injury”, or just really bad anxiety related to a new dose of a very intense medication that causes my heart rate to go up to 150bpm which would be so expensive and mildly embarrassing to go to the ER for. I told my mom I felt like I was trying to trip sit myself so she tried to help me ground which did help but then my hands and feet would get cold again and I would get anxious about it and my heart rate would go back up. 

Somewhere in there I tried calling my specialty pharmacy, Sleep Dr, and RN case manager, but it’s Labor Day so they’re all closed. I have my PCP’s cell number so I texted her and she answered !! I explained my situation to her over phone call so she could hear me and she said I sounded very anxious, not to take the medication again until I talk to my sleep doc and the specialty pharmacist, to monitor my VS, and to call out of work tomorrow using my intermittent FMLA, so that helped a ton, she’s my hero.

As the day went on my ruminating and paranoia got less and less and I remembered that people who have taken too much of a CNS stimulant often experience pretty much all of my symptoms so I just needed to be chill and wait until tomorrow when I can talk to a specialty pharmacist.

I want to know culture shock type of things that came up for you. I’m about 90% sure I’m moving there next summer.

For context, I work from home and will live near my son’s school, so I’m not worried about commute or finding a job. I am looking in the Horizon West area but could be swayed elsewhere. I love coffee, being near the water (ironic, I know), and my son plays sports in spring/fall seasons here. 

I know the summer weather is going to be different. I’ve lived in NM, AZ, NV, and WA so I’m familiar with moving to a new city and having new experiences. I am mostly looking for things you noticed majorly different in FL, or things you feel like you’re lacking now that you live in FL. Food, certain shopping outlets, the bugs and gators, dating scene if you’re single like me, cost of gas or eggs...etc.  I’ve searched for a few things we have here, like Lifetime Gym and Salad and Go, and neither of those are there, so it made me think what else will I be giving up to move there.

A week before our bonding ceremony, I overheard my mate talking to his friends. 

“You actually changed the location for Kira?” one of them teased. “Without telling your fiancée?” 

Then came his arrogant reply, laced with a smirk I could practically hear through the door. 

“It’s fine. She loves me so much she nearly died for me. She’ll do whatever I say.” 

He was so sure I’d follow him to that California beach. 

So on our bonding day, when his furious mind-link message finally came… 

“Sarah, where the hell are you?!” 

I just smiled at the snow falling on my chosen mountain peak. 

“I’ve been here for a while.” 

———————— 

1 

I had chosen our bonding ceremony to be at Aurora Peak in Alaska long ago. That place held a special meaning for me and Ethan Thornfield. 

But I never imagined he would change it just because of something Kira Reed said. 

My hands trembled. I stood frozen at the door, afraid of disturbing the Alphas inside. 

Ethan’s Beta, Leo, frowned. 

“A bonding ceremony is about two people. You should at least tell Sarah Carter, right? How else is she supposed to prepare?” 

Ethan waved his hand, annoyed. 

“What is there to prepare? Aurora Peak is freezing. Crescent Bay is so much more comfortable.” 

“But a bonding ceremony is a huge deal. Isn’t it incredibly disrespectful to not even tell her?” 

Ethan was getting impatient. 

“If she knew, she’d ask a million questions and probably throw a fit. Then I’d have to soothe her. It’s a hassle.” 

“Anyway, she loves me so much, she’ll definitely agree. Don’t you remember? She nearly died for me. What’s changing a location compared to that?” 

Someone beside him smirked. 

“I know what our Alpha is thinking. It’s all for Kira… I mean, what man could resist a fiery body like hers?” 

“Haha, we all thought you were going to marry Kira. She’s so beautiful and comes from such a good family.” 

Ethan’s face darkened at that, his Alpha presence flooding the room. 

“Shut up. Don’t let me hear that again. If Sarah Carter makes a scene, I’ll hold all of you responsible.” 

The men laughed. 

“Alright, alright, we’ll stop. You’re the man, Ethan. Sarah is completely devoted to you.” 

Suddenly, Ethan’s phone rang. The caller ID said “Kira.” The men all shared a knowing grin. 

“The real Luna is calling.” 

Ethan didn’t correct them, his voice softening as he answered. 

Kira’s sweet, flirty laugh came through the phone. 

“Ethan, did you really get me that moonstone necklace? I heard it’s exclusively for a Luna!” 

“Mhm, I had it custom-made. It’ll arrive next week.” 

“Is… is it very expensive?” 

“Only $200,000. It’s worth it if you like it.” 

Kira sounded deeply touched. 

“You’re so good to me. I’ll definitely wear it for you at the bonding ceremony!” 

Ethan smiled warmly. 

“Okay. I’ll be waiting.” 

After he hung up, his friends started hooting. 

“She’s going to outshine the bride! Ethan, are you marrying Sarah or Kira?” 



# Chapter 2: Chapter 2

 

Ethan just smiled. 

“Sarah and I are practically an old married couple. It doesn’t matter what she wears… Kira is different. She needs this more.” 

I stood at the door, a bitter smile touching my lips. My ceremony necklace was from a local jewelry store. 

The day I tried it on, my old wounds were still aching. I asked Ethan for his opinion. 

After I had tried on three, he just waved me off. 

“They all look good. Let’s just get this one. You don’t know anything about jewelry anyway.” 

He was in a hurry to pay. The receipt came to $20,000. 

So, he was capable of planning thoughtful surprises. Just not for me. 

On the way home, I bit my lip so hard it almost bled, but tears streamed down my face regardless. 

Six years. 

For six whole years, I had naively believed that he understood me. 

When I first told him I wanted our bonding ceremony at Aurora Peak, he smiled, ruffled my hair, and said, “Okay.” 

I was so moved in that moment. 

He remembers, I told myself. He had to. 

He remembered it was where we first met. He remembered I fell and was covered in blood for him. He remembered how I held his hand tightly in a blizzard and said, “Don’t be afraid.” 

But it turned out he didn’t remember at all. 

Or rather, he had never truly cared. 

I remembered the healer’s warning that emotional turmoil would affect my recovery. I tilted my head back, trying to force the tears back, but my throat was tight with sobs. 

Ethan contacted me through our mind-link. The background was a wall of sound, the music deafening. 

“Sarah, Leo and the guys are throwing me a bachelor party tonight. I won’t be home.” 

I paused for two seconds. 

“Okay.” 

This “bachelor party” had been going on for three days. 

At 1 a.m., I couldn’t sleep and scrolled through social media. 

Leo had posted a nine-photo grid with the caption: The Alpha’s Last Night of Freedom. 

In the center photo, Kira, her cheeks flushed, was leaning drunkenly in Ethan’s arms. Ethan’s hand was pressed firmly against her bare waist. 

There were plenty of comments below: 

“They look so good together. What a shame.” 

“They grew up together, don’t start rumors.” 

“Ethan Thornfield, watch yourself! Don’t make Sarah mad!” 

Ethan had replied to that one. 

“Sarah won’t mind. If she makes a fuss over something this small, then we shouldn’t even be getting mated.” 

I quietly liked his comment, then turned off my phone and went to sleep. 



# Chapter 3: Chapter 3

 

He was so sure I would put up with it, just like I put up with him changing the ceremony location, put up with the $200,000 necklace, and put up with every “we’re just friends.” 

But this time, I didn’t want to put up with it anymore. 

I went to the pack’s medical center alone for a follow-up on my old injuries. 

“I told you last time, your old wounds are unstable. Someone must come with you.” 

Hearing the healer’s words, I just smiled quietly. 

“I can handle it by myself.” 

As I left the medical center, a heavy rain began to fall. 

I glanced into a nearby coffee shop and saw two people. Ethan was holding up his phone, and Kira was leaning on his shoulder. They were in a close embrace. 

The watch on Kira’s wrist was the new model Ethan had said he was “getting for a client” last week. 

I laughed at my own foolishness and walked home in the downpour. 

When Ethan got home, I was taking off my soaked shirt, revealing the black lace lingerie underneath. 

He looked up and froze, his Adam’s apple bobbing. 

“Why are you soaked?” 

“My follow-up.” 

Ethan’s expression stiffened. 

“That was today?” 

I gave a small laugh. 

“Yes. This was the third time I reminded you.” 

Ethan ran a hand through his hair, frustrated. 

“I’ve been too busy lately, I forgot. Anyway, you’ve recovered. Missing one appointment is fine.” 

I watched him quietly. 

“The healer said my wolf core is still shrinking.” 

Ethan was speechless. After a moment, he looked up, a hint of displeasure in his eyes. 

“Are you trying to remind me again that you almost died for me?” 

So, that’s what this was. 

In his eyes, my sacrifice was just a tool I used to make him feel guilty. 

When I didn’t say anything, Ethan suddenly became furious. 

“There’s that dead-eyed stare again! I forgot one time! Why do you always get so worked up over every little thing?” 

I looked at his collar and said softly. 

“You have Kira’s perfume on you.” 

Ethan instinctively sniffed his collar and froze. 

“You…” 

I added calmly, “Kira’s new watch looks nice.” 

Ethan’s face turned red with anger. He pointed a finger at me, exasperated. 

“Are you following me? Seriously? She was just in a bad mood and wanted to talk!” 

“You know what her family situation is like! She only has me!” 

“Sarah Carter, can’t you be more generous? This is getting ridiculous!” 



# Chapter 4: Chapter 4

 

I couldn’t help but laugh out loud. 

“What a coincidence… At my appointment, I also ‘only had me.’” 

Ethan seemed stung by that. He stammered, “She’s different… You have people who care about you…” 

Suddenly, his phone rang. It was Kira again. 

Ethan quickly answered. Kira’s tearful voice came from the other end. 

“Ethan, I fell. It hurts so much…” 

“Don’t be scared, I’m coming right now…” 

He hung up and pulled the door open. Then, as if remembering something, he looked back at me. 

“You should think about what you’ve done. I’ll take you to the gift shop tomorrow.” 

“And stop following me… it makes you look pathetic.” 

Ethan left, but his words echoed in my ears. 

Pathetic? 

He was right. 

I just couldn’t believe it took me this long to see it. 

It seems my heart has been blind for a very long time. 

On the way to the gift shop, the atmosphere in the car was beyond awkward. 

I put in my earbuds and closed my eyes. 

Ethan tapped his fingers on the steering wheel, restless and anxious. 

“This weather is perfect for the beach…” 

He kept glancing my way. 

When I didn’t respond, he cleared his throat and spoke louder. 

“I heard Crescent Bay in California is really popular right now. A lot of famous people are having their bonding ceremonies there.” 

I still didn’t open my eyes. I just hummed lightly. 

Ethan frowned, his voice tinged with irritation. 

“Sarah, are you even listening to me?” 

I opened my eyes slightly. 

“I’m listening. So what?” 

Ethan was caught off guard. 

“…Nothing. Just making conversation.” 

A light breeze drifted in from the window, and I felt a bit more clear-headed. 

“Ethan, about the bonding ceremony… is there anything you need to tell me?” 

I turned to look at him. This was the only time I would ask him, and it would be the last. 

He avoided my gaze, giving an awkward laugh. 

“Everything is in your hands. I trust you.” 

I lowered my eyes, my expression sinking. 

He was still pretending. 

Even now, if he would just be honest, maybe I could still… no. I couldn’t. 

I clenched my fists. So this is what trust was for. To be trampled on. 

Ethan gave a dry laugh, his eyes shifting nervously. 

She must know. She's just pouting. I'll smooth things over later. 

Inside the gift shop, I saw the sample for the custom gifts I had ordered. The Aurora Peak design looked exquisite. 

Just as I was about to confirm the order, a familiar laugh came from behind me. 



# Chapter 5: Chapter 5

 

“Ethan? Are you here to buy me that crystal wolf?” 

I frowned. Her again? 

When Kira saw me, she covered her mouth in surprise. 

“Oh, Sarah? I’m so sorry, I didn’t see you…” 

“Oh, are you two picking out gifts? The crystal wolves at this shop are gorgeous. Ethan brings me here all the time!” 

My fingers tightened slightly. He had brought her here many times, while I only found out about this place from a friend. 

Kira picked up a seashell decoration. 

“Sarah, how about this one? It’s perfect for a beach ceremony. It would go perfectly with champagne!” 

I took a small step back. 

“No, thanks. I’ve already made my choice. You two can take your time.” 

Kira froze for a second, her expression turning hurt and innocent. 

“Are you… upset because I’m here? Then I-I’ll just go.” 

Ethan grabbed Kira’s wrist. 

“Sarah doesn’t mean that. You don’t have to go.” 

He turned to me, staring into my eyes. 

“Sarah, Kira is going to be your bridesmaid. Don’t be so harsh, you’ll scare her.” 

I was stunned. When was that decided? Shouldn’t I be the one to choose my bridesmaid? 

But then I thought, he changed the ceremony location on his own. What else would he need my permission for? 

I replied without emotion, “This is who I am. Take it or leave it.” 

They both stared at me, clearly not expecting such a serious response. 

Kira’s eyes turned red. 

“Fine, I’ll just go. I don’t want to be in the way.” 

But Ethan held onto her hand, lacing his fingers with hers. 

“Sarah Carter, you’re about to become my mate. Why are you still so childish?” 

“Ever since we set the date, you’ve been moody all the time. Is this fun for you?” 

Kira quietly tried to calm him down, but leaned even closer. 

“Ethan, don’t…” 

Ethan seemed agitated. 

“Don’t try to stop me. I’ve had enough!” 

“Go on, Sarah Carter, keep acting out! But don’t blame me for not coddling you when you secretly tear open your old wounds out of jealousy!” 

The shop fell silent. The staff awkwardly looked down. 

My heart felt like it had been plunged into ice. 

So, in his eyes, my serious injury… was just me “self-harming” out of jealousy. 

And here I was, still hoping he would remember the meaning of Aurora Peak. 

How many times had this happened? Kira would use “not feeling well” or a “headache” as an excuse for Ethan to be with her, and he would drop our plans to go take care of her every time. 

When my old injury flared up and I was shaking from the pain, Ethan was supposed to be with me, but he left to go shopping with Kira, only sending a text: “I’ll come see you later.” He never came. 

Whenever I complained, he would say, “Why can’t you be more understanding? Kira really needs me!” 

For our anniversary, Ethan promised to take me to see the Northern Lights. 

I carefully prepared a gift, but he forgot again. 

“It’s just a date. Do you have to be so serious about it?” 

But for Kira’s birthday, Ethan booked a restaurant and bought gifts a month in advance. He even posted on Instagram. 

“Happy birthday to the most important person in my life.” 

Thinking about the past and looking at the present… 

I was tired. 

I should have given up on him and left a long time ago. 



# Chapter 6: Chapter 6

 

As I turned to leave, Ethan tossed a final remark at my back. 

“She’s probably just got pre-wedding jitters. Don’t pay any attention to a sick person…” 

How kind of him to make excuses for me. 

Through the glass window, I saw him holding Kira’s hand, feeding her a pastry. 

They were the ones who looked like a couple. 

That night, I received a voice message from Ethan. 

“Sarah, don’t be mad.” 

“I’m managing the whole pack and the company, and I have to take care of both of you. Can’t you be more considerate?” 

“We’ll be mates soon. I need you to be more mature.” 

He sounded a little drunk, rambling on and on. 

I had no desire to listen anymore. 

He had it the hardest, of course. 

So I decided I would do him a favor and lighten his burden for good. 

The day before the bonding ceremony, Ethan couldn’t hold it in any longer. He called me. 

“Sarah, the ceremony schedule… you’ve confirmed everything, right?” 

I hummed a soft ""yes"" as I packed my bags for Alaska. 

“Mhm, I’ve looked over everything.” 

Ethan sounded relieved. 

“Good… that’s good…” 

“I’ll pick you up tomorrow.” 

The next day, I put on my ceremonial dress. It wasn’t the one Ethan had picked out. 

I heard a car pull up outside, and my phone rang. 

Ethan’s voice was rushed. 

“Sarah, Kira isn’t feeling well. I’m taking her to the medical center now, so I can’t pick you up.” 

“Just go to the ceremony site yourself. It’s just a formality anyway. I’ll head straight there later.” 

I replied calmly. 

“Okay.” 

Ethan paused, as if sensing something was off in my tone. 

“You’re… not mad, are you?” 

“No. You go do what you need to do.” 

The call ended. Ethan let out a sigh of relief and turned to Kira in the passenger seat. 

“Does it hurt? Just hang in there, we’re almost at the medical center.” 

Kira’s eyes were filled with tears. 

“I’m so sorry. This is all my fault, making you late to pick up Sarah…” 

Ethan squeezed her hand reassuringly. 

“Don’t say that. You’re hurt. How could I not take care of you?” 

But a sense of unease settled in his heart. My attitude had been far too calm. 

Maybe Sarah has finally come to her senses. She knows she has a place in my heart. 

After the ceremony, once she has my mark, I’ll teach her her place. 

At the ceremony site in Crescent Bay, California, Ethan’s pack had arrived, but not a single member of the bride’s pack was there. 

Ethan arrived with Kira, and his heart sank when he saw the scene. 

No way… Don’t tell me Sarah didn’t see that the location was changed… 

He couldn’t bear to imagine it. 

He tried calling me, but no one answered. He kept checking his watch, his face growing darker by the minute. 

Finally, my phone connected. 

Ethan yelled, his voice frayed with anxiety. 

“Sarah Carter, where are you? Everyone is waiting!” 

I looked at the snowflakes drifting outside the window.

Between 2018 and 2022, he turned “quality investing” into a near-cult, urging investors to stay the course with high-quality, high-priced stocks even when they looked expensive. The strategy delivered handsomely—until it didn’t.

As the post-Covid recovery broadened and cyclical sectors began to roar back, the quality pack stumbled. Performance lagged, redemptions snowballed, and Marcellus’s assets under management shrank from a peak of over ₹12,000 crore in October 2022 to just ₹4,750 crore by June 2025. For Mukherjea, the reversal was as much a personal trial as a professional one. “It’s about holding your body and mind together. And then, separating noise from signal, and working to better my game,” he reflects.

In a candid conversation with N Mahalakshmi on the Wealth Formula podcast, Mukherjea spoke about the mistakes that shaped him, the lessons that endure, and the Indian investors he most admires.

**Q: Over the last three years, how has your approach to valuations and moat investing changed? You’ve said before that your thinking has evolved — what exactly has shifted? What’s in your new checklist?**

A: The unchanging pieces are clear. First, heavy-duty forensics — using both quantitative and qualitative research to avoid the rogues. In any stock market, 30–40% of companies will flatter numbers to juice up share prices and then raise capital.

Second, among the cleaner companies, focus on those with strong franchises. We measure a franchise simply: ROCE and long-term return on capital above cost of capital. That remains the basic test of quality.

What changed in 2022–23 was threefold.

First, we realized that consistent compounders by definition deliver 15% profit growth, maybe 20% in good years. If such a stock doubles in 12–18 months, the share price is running far ahead of profits. A reversion to mean is almost certain. You can either sit tight through that correction — but when you’re managing large sums and clients enter at the top, the drawdowns become very painful.

Take Divi’s Labs. It soared during Covid on Molnupiravir profits, and we trimmed our position as the pandemic ended. But we didn’t cut enough. By Jan 2022 the company said Covid was over, and in 9–10 months the stock halved. Our clients bore that pain. That taught us: either stop taking new money when portfolios are euphoric, or re-size positions so late entrants don’t face the worst of the drawdowns.

Second, we had to do this methodically. That’s when our Global Compounders team suggested we size positions not by expected earnings growth alone, but by expected IRR. For example, if EPS growth is 20% but you believe the PE multiple will halve over five years, you subtract \~8% and assume a 12% return. That naturally reduces position size and incorporates valuation mean reversion.

By mid-2023, we implemented this IRR-based sizing.

Third, to make this work we had to broaden coverage. Instead of tracking 60–70 names, we expanded to 130–140 through 2022–24. A wave of IPOs helped. Wider coverage meant we could trim overheated stocks and still have fresh options.

These are lessons no book can teach. We started in 2018, and in three years had ₹5,000 crore flowing in. It was a bewildering experience. Only in hindsight did we grasp how early success blindsides you. That was our biggest challenge — not the market, but the consequences of our own success.

The good news is, we’re wiser. Performance has improved since applying IRR discipline. Our Global Compounders portfolio has compounded \~26–27% in rupee terms net of fees. MeritorQ, our quant strategy, is up \~17–17.5%, ahead of benchmark. Little Champs and Rising Giants, which were crushed in 2021–22, have bounced back. Kings of Capital — after a rough patch when PSU banks ran — is recovering. Even Consistent Compounders has improved, though we think IRR discipline can be applied more aggressively there.

**Q: It takes courage to admit early success blindsided you.**

A: It’s incumbent on us. In this business, the better the performance, the more faith people place in you. That’s precisely when you need to be careful about taking money and deploying it. You can either stop accepting inflows when performance is hot, or keep taking money but cut down position sizes in the stocks that have delivered the most. In hindsight, we should have done more of the latter. We do now.

**Q: But is this only about position sizing? What about your approach to valuations in general? You used to say you could disregard PE if the company was great.**

A: For individual investors, the Coffee Can approach still works best. Let quality companies run. Timing is near impossible. Take Divi’s again: stellar until Covid, then supercharged, then halved in 2022, then doubled again post-2023. If you’d sold at the Covid peak, you’d likely never have bought back. Individuals without armies of analysts are better off staying invested and letting time work.

For professionals like us, it’s different. When a stock soars, inflows pour in and we’re forced to deploy at stretched valuations. When mean reversion hits, new investors get hurt. Hence our IRR approach.

**Q: So for individuals, valuations can be ignored if the business is strong?**

A: Unless you’re a valuation expert, yes. Most investors have jobs and limited time. It’s unrealistic to track multiples daily, speak to analysts, and time entries and exits. That’s why Coffee Can investing, as Rob Kirby argued in 1984, remains the best bet for retail investors. Otherwise, you risk selling after a 50% drawdown and missing the next 10x run.

**Q: But do historic valuations matter to you? Do you benchmark against them?**

A: Yes, with caveats. We use three comparisons. Let’s take the example of Trent:

Index: If Nifty trades at 15–17x and a stock is at 120x, it’s clearly overheated.

Sector: If retail trades at 40–50x and Trent is at 120x, it signals potential pullback.

Company history: If Trent historically traded 50–60x and is now 120x, that’s another marker.

Using these, we estimate fair value and then adjust expected returns. For instance, if Trent at 120x should mean revert to 60–70x, we’d shave 8% off projected EPS growth of 25%, arriving at \~17% expected return — our position sizing anchor.

But this has limits. Take Titan. For 20 years, its “steady-state PE” has drifted up. Many dismissed it as just gold retail, but Titan kept improving supply chains, working capital, and made a stellar CaratLane acquisition. It became a fundamentally better business, justifying higher multiples. That’s the hard part: recognizing when a company today is meaningfully stronger than a decade ago.

**Q: And how do you judge that?**

A: We’re still refining our methods. A simple starting point: track rolling five-year ROCEs. If they consistently drift up, something’s working. That’s often your best clue that the company is creating real, compounding value.

**Q: Fair enough. Now give me three examples of stocks which have taught you the maximum.**

A: As I explained earlier, sometimes the biggest lessons come from the same company going up, down, and up again. Thankfully, in the last couple of years we managed to catch the upside.

Take HDFC Bank. The learning there was like the Ferrari versus one-litre engine analogy. If someone had told me back in 2018, when we set up the firm, that we would have a portfolio of HDFC Bank, Divis Labs, Dr. Lal Path Labs, Asian Paints — all top-class franchises — with earnings growth in double digits, and yet see the portfolio fall 15% in just 15 months, I would have said nahi ho sakta. But we lived through it.

Back in 2022, there wasn’t an earnings problem with any of these names. Earnings growth was mid-teens. We would sit in the office wondering: “Earnings growth is good, so why is the portfolio going backwards?” The answer was reversion to mean. In the five years through 2021, our portfolio compounded at 25% annually while the market did 18%, on the back of earnings growth of 17–18%. That was well above fair expectation. Life has now taught us that you need to anticipate mean reversion, adjust for it, and factor it in. That was a big lesson.

**Q: One stock that taught you the hardest lesson?**

The hardest learning, though, was Relaxo. During Covid, people were at home buying slippers, and we thought demand would sustain. After all, a Relaxo chappal is an essential product. But when oil prices rose post-Covid, Relaxo hiked prices sharply. Their entry-level chappal that sold at ₹85 during Covid jumped to ₹150–160 within a year. That’s when the company lost leadership to the informal sector.

The unorganised players make chappals by melting milk packets, costing just ₹50–60. If Relaxo was at ₹80, customers would choose the organised brand. But when the price moved to ₹150 and the alternative stayed at ₹60, the market shifted away.

It was shocking because here was a company that had made great corporate decisions for decades, creating 100x shareholder returns over 20 years. Yet one strategic misstep cost them dearly — and cost us as well. Even now, two-and-a-half years after we sold, they haven’t regained their mojo. And this is footwear — there’s been no massive structural change in the market. To see a franchise that dominated for 10–15 years regress like this was one of the most painful but valuable learnings.

**Q: Anything else which taught you a specific investment lesson?**

A: Yes. In small caps, especially specialty chemicals, we had a huge run during Covid. Between 2019 and 2021, our Little Champs portfolio doubled in three years, powered by specialty chemicals and related ancillaries. But once Covid ended, Chinese supply came back and China started dumping into global markets. Those same companies that looked like structural compounders suddenly looked cyclical.

The mistake was taking three years of unusual data — when global trade was frozen — and extrapolating it as structural strength. The lesson was to take a much longer view in assessing businesses, otherwise you risk confusing temporary tailwinds for long-term trends. Post-Covid, Little Champs suffered as those specialty chemical bets failed.

**Q: Would you extend this learning to your earlier point — that as a private investor, if you find a great company, you should just sit it out? What about commodities or cyclical plays?**

A: The bigger point is this: everything is cyclical. Even hawai chappals are cyclical. Paint is cyclical. Blood tests at Dr. Lal Path Labs are cyclical. In 2023, it hit us that cycles exist everywhere — even where the data doesn’t scream it.

For steel or real estate, cycles are obvious. But in diagnostics, paint, footwear, the cycles are more subtle. As investors, we now consciously try to identify cycles where others believe none exist, and invest accordingly.

Take banking today. NPAs are rising, liabilities are hard to raise — a great environment for HDFC Bank. For a few quarters, it will enjoy a hammerlock on low-cost liabilities and could push ROEs toward 20%. But eventually, as conditions ease, competition for deposits will return, and HDFC Bank’s edge will erode. That second- and third-step thinking wasn’t well developed for us during Covid. We’re better at it now.

**Q: The last two years have been difficult for you on account of both performance and considerable redemptions. How has this period been for you personally? How have you coped?**

A: It’s one thing to read about cycles before starting a business, another to live through them. You hear people say if you can’t stomach a 50% drawdown, you shouldn’t be an investor. But when you actually go through it, you realize it’s about holding mind and body together while the world calls you a loser.

At the same time, you have to cut noise and focus: What did we do right? What did we do wrong? What can we fix? Mistakes are part of investing. The key is to minimize them and not repeat the same ones.

It’s also a privilege. Markets and clients both give you feedback constantly. If you can’t take it, this isn’t the right job. But if you can, you separate signal from noise. For example, some said Coffee Can or quality investing was dead in India. That was noise. The signal was to refine our process, learn, and keep managing money for those who trust us.

We’ve been lucky with supportive clients. The Indian Navy officers’ pension fund, which we manage, has been a source of pride. They’ve stood by us, given constructive feedback, and handled volatility with equanimity. Institutional clients abroad have also been steady. And many Indian families who entrusted us with life savings stayed invested through tough times.

Personally, I enjoy this part. It keeps you alive, forces you to learn every day, and gives you the chance to be a little better than yesterday. My colleagues are even better at this mindset than I am. Going through cycles as a team has been enriching.

**Q: Are there investors in India you admire and have learned from?**

A: Absolutely. We’ve known Pulak Prasad of Nalanda for years — back in my brokerage days, I helped with block deals for him. Over time, my admiration for him and his team has grown. His book on what evolution teaches us about investing was epic; everyone in our office read it three times over. It became like a Bible.

Another is Sankaran Naren of ICICI Prudential. I first wrote about him in Gurus of Chaos 15 years ago. Since then, I’ve had the chance to learn from him as a broker and later as a fellow market participant. Watching him navigate cycles over 30 years has been rewarding.

During Covid, he repeatedly warned me about valuations, pointing to historical periods when expensive stocks corrected. I argued that Covid was so unusual that history wasn’t comparable. In the end, Naren was right. Especially in small caps, we’ve tried to apply many of his lessons.",1,1756793109.0,u_Moneycontrol,0,1.0,False

1n6bpia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contemporary_Romance/comments/1n6bpia/my_ceos_masked_desire/,My CEO's Masked Desire,"I dragged myself through the front door of my parents' house, my body aching from a fourteen-hour day split between my office job and evening classes. All I wanted was a hot shower and my bed, but the tension radiating from the living room told me I wouldn't get either anytime soon.



""Monica."" My father's voice cut through the silence. ""Come in here. Now.""



I found them sitting rigidly on the sofa, my mother's lips pressed into a thin line, my father's fingers drumming against his knee. Between them on the coffee table sat a cream-colored envelope with gold trim.



""What's going on?"" I asked, dropping my bag by the doorway.



My mother held up the envelope. ""Grace's wedding invitation arrived today.""



A cold wave of anger washed over me. ""That backstabbing little—""



""Monica!"" My father's voice boomed through the room. ""That's enough of this childishness.""



""Childishness?"" I laughed bitterly. ""Finding my boyfriend of four years having sex with my cousin in my bed is childish?""



My mother sighed dramatically. ""Tyler was wrong, of course. But poor Grace was seduced by him. He's doing the honorable thing now by marrying her.""



The absurdity of her defense made my stomach turn. ""Mom, the entire town knows Grace's reputation. She wasn't 'seduced' by anyone.""



""Watch your language, young lady,"" my father warned, his face reddening. ""We've had enough drama with Natalie attacking them both that day. Your mother's sister is devastated by this family rift.""



I closed my eyes, remembering the look of shock on Tyler's face when I walked in on them. How Grace had smirked before pretending to be embarrassed. How my best friend Natalie had lunged at them both while I stood frozen in disbelief.



""I understand you're upset,"" my mother continued, her voice softening in that manipulative way I'd grown to recognize. ""But you're going to this wedding.""



""I'm what?"" I stared at her, certain I'd misheard.



""You're attending the wedding,"" my father said firmly. ""As our daughter, you will represent this family with dignity.""



Hot tears burned behind my eyes. ""You want me to stand there and smile while my cousin marries the man who broke my heart in my own bedroom? Are you serious?""



""ENOUGH!"" My father slammed his hand on the armrest. ""This discussion is over. You're going, and that's final.""



""But Dad—""



""Not another word, Monica. Your mother needs family peace, and you will help provide it.""



I retreated to my bedroom, tears streaming down my face. My phone buzzed twice before I answered it.



""They're making me go to the wedding, Natalie,"" I sobbed into the phone.



""Those insensitive jerks!"" Natalie's protective fury warmed me. ""Don't worry, Monica. I have a plan.""



The next afternoon, Natalie burst into my workplace, carrying coffee and chocolate muffins, her eyes gleaming with mischief.



""The Peterson Foundation's Annual Masquerade Ball,"" she announced, slapping an elegant black invitation onto my desk. ""It's this Saturday night—same time as the wedding.""



I glanced up from the stack of invoices I was processing. ""A masquerade ball? What are you talking about?""



""Your escape plan,"" she whispered dramatically. ""I've already told your parents it's a networking event crucial for your career. I said all our professors will be there introducing students to potential employers."" She grinned. ""My father backed me up. They bought it completely.""



I studied her hopeful face. ""You want me to lie to my parents?""



""No, I want you to save yourself from public humiliation,"" she corrected. ""Besides, this ball is the event of the year. Everyone who matters will be there. It's not a complete lie that it could help your career.""



Her enthusiasm was contagious, but doubt still nagged at me. ""I don't know, Natalie...""



""Monica Hayes,"" Natalie leaned across my desk, her expression serious. ""You work all day, study all night, and follow every rule. For once in your life, do something for yourself. Don't let them force you to watch that cheating jerk marry your snake of a cousin.""



I bit my lip, considering her words. ""My parents will be furious if they find out.""



""They won't,"" she assured me. ""We'll stay at my place after. I've already bought our masks. Please, Monica? You deserve one night of freedom.""



Against my better judgment, I found myself nodding. ""Fine. I'll go to your stupid ball.""



Saturday evening arrived, and I stood in Natalie's bedroom, barely recognizing myself in the mirror. The red satin dress she'd insisted I wear hugged curves I usually kept hidden under practical clothes. The golden lace mask transformed my face, making my green eyes seem mysterious and alluring.



""Wow, girl!"" Natalie whistled, adjusting her own blue mask. ""You look absolutely stunning! Tyler is going to regret that day for the rest of his miserable life.""



I smoothed the fabric of my dress nervously. ""This doesn't feel like me, Natalie.""



""That's the whole point of a masquerade,"" she replied, handing me a delicate gold clutch. ""Tonight, you can be whoever you want to be.""



I took a deep breath, my hands trembling slightly as I looked in the mirror one last time. Natalie, sensing my nerves, handed me my small perfume bottle from her vanity.



""One last touch,"" she said with an encouraging smile. ""A little bit of the real Monica.""



I spritzed the light, floral scent onto my wrists.



When we descended the stairs, Jasper, Natalie's boyfriend, waited at the bottom, his eyes widening at the sight of us.



""Ladies, you both look incredible,"" he said, kissing Natalie before turning to me. ""Monica, I predict you'll leave this party with a new boyfriend.""



The thought of meeting someone new sent panic coursing through my veins. Standing in Natalie's foyer, dressed in clothes that didn't feel like mine, about to enter a world of strangers while lying to my parents, I suddenly felt overwhelmed.



""No boyfriend, Jasper,"" I said, backing away slightly. ""Actually, I think I'd better stay. I'm not in the party mood after all. Please, Natalie, let me stay?""

...



Monica's POV



""I can't believe you dragged me to this party,"" I groaned, adjusting my golden lace mask as Natalie pulled me through the grand entrance of the Peterson Foundation's Annual Masquerade Ball.



""Stop complaining,"" Natalie hissed, her blue mask catching the light. ""This is exactly what you need after everything that's happened. One night to forget Tyler and that snake Grace.""



The ballroom was stunning—crystal chandeliers casting a warm glow over silk-draped tables and elegant flower arrangements. Beautiful strangers swirled across the marble dance floor in their elaborate masks and designer clothes. I felt like an impostor in my borrowed red satin dress.



""I'm heading to the open bar,"" I announced, needing liquid courage. ""Want anything?""



Natalie's eyes were already fixed on Jasper, who was waiting for her on the dance floor. ""I'm good. Go have fun, Monica. That's an order.""



Left alone, I made my way to the bar and ordered a gin and tonic. As I took my first sip, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Someone was watching me.



""Grey suits you,"" a deep voice murmured from behind.



I turned to find myself facing a tall figure in an impeccable black suit and matching mask. Despite the concealment, I could feel the intensity of his gaze. His eyes were the most unusual color I'd ever seen—a striking violet-blue that seemed to glow in the dim light.



""Thank you,"" I replied, my voice unexpectedly breathless.



He moved closer, his broad shoulders blocking out the rest of the room. ""Dance with me.""



It wasn't a question, but I found myself nodding anyway. He took my glass, set it on the bar, and led me to the dance floor with confident hands. When his arm circled my waist, electricity shot through me.



""I don't normally do this,"" I admitted as we began to move.



His lips curved into a smile. ""Do what? Dance?""



""Talk to strangers. Follow their commands.""



He pulled me closer, his warm breath tickling my ear. ""Yet here you are.""



As we moved together, I found myself melting against his chest. The solid wall of muscle beneath his jacket, the intoxicating scent of his cologne, the way his hand splayed possessively against my lower back—it all conspired to make me forget why I'd been so reluctant to come tonight.



""You're not from around here,"" he stated, his fingers tracing small circles on my back.



""How can you tell?""



""I know everyone worth knowing in this city,"" he replied with confidence that should have been arrogant but somehow wasn't. ""I would remember you.""



The room suddenly felt too warm, too crowded. My head spun slightly—whether from the gin, his proximity, or the lingering pain of Tyler's betrayal, I couldn't tell.



""Are you alright?"" he asked, noticing my discomfort.



""Just a little dizzy,"" I admitted. ""It's hot in here.""



Without another word, he guided me away from the dance floor, his hand firm against the small of my back. We moved through a service door into a dimly lit hallway, the music fading to a distant thrum. Cool air rushed over my heated skin.



""Better?"" he asked, his voice dropping to a husky whisper.



I nodded, suddenly aware of how alone we were. How close he stood. How desperately I wanted to feel something—anything—other than the humiliation and heartbreak that had consumed me for weeks.



""Your eyes,"" I whispered, reaching up to touch the edge of his mask. ""I've never seen that color before.""



""Family trait,"" he replied, capturing my wrist in his warm grip. ""Are you going to tell me your name?""



I shook my head slowly. ""Isn't that against the rules of a masquerade? We're supposed to be anonymous.""



His smile turned predatory. ""I like breaking rules.""



""So do I,"" I heard myself say, surprised by my boldness. ""Tonight, anyway.""



Something dangerous flashed in his eyes. ""What happened to the woman who doesn't talk to strangers?""



""She got tired of playing it safe and getting hurt anyway.""



The confession hung between us for a heartbeat before he closed the distance, pressing me against the wall. His lips found mine in a kiss that started gentle but quickly blazed into something wild and consuming. I'd never been kissed like this before—like I was air and he was drowning.



My fingers threaded through his hair as his hands explored my body through the thin satin of my dress. Every touch ignited a new flame under my skin. When his mouth moved to my neck, I gasped.



""Tell me to stop,"" he growled against my throat.



""Don't stop,"" I whispered back.



What happened next was a blur of sensation—his hands sliding my dress up my thighs, my fingers fumbling with his belt, our bodies joining in a frenzied, desperate rhythm against the wall. I'd never done anything so reckless in my life, yet nothing had ever felt more right.



He whispered delicious, filthy things in my ear as we moved together, driving me higher and higher until I shattered in his arms with a cry he captured with his mouth. He followed moments later, his body tensing as he held me against the wall.



For several minutes afterward, we simply clung to each other, our ragged breathing the only sound in the hallway. His forehead rested against mine, our masks slightly askew.



""That was..."" he began, his voice rougher than before.



""Unexpected,"" I finished for him, a small laugh escaping my lips.



He pulled back slightly, his violet-blue eyes studying my face with newfound intensity. ""I want to see you again. Tell me who you—""



Before he could finish, a phone rang loudly in his pocket. He cursed, pulling it out to check the screen. His expression darkened instantly.



""I have to take this,"" he said, already moving away. ""Wait here.""



He answered the call, walking a few steps down the hallway. ""What happened?"" I heard him snap. Then, ""I'll be right there. Twenty minutes.""



When he turned back to me, his face had transformed completely. Gone was the passionate stranger who'd held me moments before, replaced by someone coldly professional and distracted.



""I have to go,"" he said, straightening his tie. ""Emergency at work.""



""Oh,"" I managed, suddenly feeling very small and foolish as I adjusted my dress. ""Of course.""



He hesitated, looking torn. ""I wanted to ask your—""



""It's fine,"" I cut him off, embarrassment flooding through me. What had I done? I'd just had unprotected sex with a complete stranger against a wall. This wasn't me. ""You should go.""



He nodded once, his jaw tight. ""Goodbye then.""



And just like that, he was gone, leaving me alone in the hallway with my smudged lipstick and tangled hair.



I didn't know it then, but that night would change my life forever. In nine months, I would hold the beautiful consequence of our reckless passion in my arms—a perfect baby boy with his father's unmistakable violet-blue eyes.



The father whose name I never learned.



The father I was certain I would never see again.



How wrong I would turn out to be.

...



Monica's POV



The morning sunlight streamed through my blinds, waking me with its harsh reminder of reality. My head pounded, not just from the gin, but from the sudden, horrifying realization that crashed over me.



""Oh God,"" I whispered, sitting bolt upright in bed.



We hadn't used protection. The stranger with the violet-blue eyes and I had been so caught up in the moment, so desperate for each other, that we'd completely forgotten the most basic precaution.



My stomach twisted with anxiety as I grabbed my phone and called the clinic. The receptionist's cheerful voice grated against my nerves as I scheduled an appointment.



""The earliest we can see you is the Thursday after next, Miss Hayes.""



""That's fine,"" I replied, my voice shaking slightly. ""Thank you.""



The days leading up to my appointment passed in a fog of worry. I threw myself into work at Diego's construction company, hoping physical exhaustion would quiet my mind. It didn't.



""You're going to wear a hole in that floor,"" Natalie commented as I paced her living room the night before my appointment. ""Whatever happens tomorrow, we'll handle it together.""



I nodded, grateful yet terrified. ""What if I'm—"" I couldn't even say the word.



""Then we'll figure it out,"" Natalie said firmly. ""One step at a time.""



The doctor's office was sterile and cold, the waiting room filled with women in various stages of their medical journeys. Some clearly pregnant, others like me – clutching their purses with white knuckles, hoping for good news.



""Monica Hayes?"" the nurse called.



Natalie squeezed my hand. ""Want me to come in?""



I nodded, too nervous to speak.



Dr. Rivera was a kind-faced woman in her fifties who reviewed my chart with efficient movements. ""Well, Monica, your blood work has come back. You're free of any sexually transmitted infections.""



Relief washed over me, but the doctor hadn't finished.



""However,"" she continued, meeting my eyes with gentle professionalism, ""your pregnancy test came back positive. Based on the dates you provided, you're approximately two weeks along.""



The room tilted sideways. Natalie's grip on my hand tightened, anchoring me as the doctor's words echoed in my head. Pregnant. Two weeks. By a man whose name I didn't know. Whose face I'd never fully seen.



""There are options we can discuss,"" Dr. Rivera continued, her voice seeming to come from far away. ""If you'd like to—""



""I need time to think,"" I interrupted, my voice sounding foreign to my own ears.



The doctor nodded understandingly. ""Of course. Here's some information."" She handed me several pamphlets. ""Take some time, but don't wait too long to make decisions.""



Outside in Natalie's car, I finally broke. Sobs tore from my throat as she held me awkwardly across the center console.



""What am I going to do?"" I cried. ""My parents will throw me out. I don't even know who the father is!""



""Shh,"" Natalie soothed, stroking my hair. ""Your parents love you. And you have me. Always.""



When my tears finally subsided, I stared out at the parking lot, my mind clearing for the first time since hearing the news.



""I'm keeping it,"" I said quietly.



Natalie turned to look at me. ""You're sure?""



I placed my hand over my still-flat stomach. ""Yes. This baby deserves a chance.""



""Then I'm going to be the best godmother ever,"" Natalie declared, her eyes shining with unshed tears. ""But first, we need to tell your parents.""



That evening, I sat in my childhood living room, hands trembling as my parents took their usual seats. Dad in his worn leather recliner, Mom perched on the edge of the sofa. Natalie sat beside me, our shoulders touching in silent support.



""Mom, Dad,"" I began, my voice barely audible. ""I have something important to tell you.""



Their expressions shifted from curious to concerned as I recounted a sanitized version of the masquerade ball, ending with the bombshell revelation.



""I'm pregnant,"" I finished, tears streaming down my face. ""I'm so sorry to disappoint you.""



The silence that followed was deafening. My mother's face had drained of color, and my father's jaw was clenched tight.



""How could you be so irresponsible?"" Mom finally whispered, her eyes filled with hurt. ""After everything we taught you?""



""I know,"" I choked out. ""I made a mistake.""



Dad stood abruptly, pacing the small room. I braced myself for his anger, for the words that would cut me off from my family forever.



Instead, he stopped in front of me, his expression softening as he looked at my tear-streaked face.



""Are you planning to keep the baby?"" he asked, his voice rough but controlled.



I nodded, unable to speak.



To my astonishment, he knelt in front of me, taking my hands in his. ""Then you'll stay here with us. We'll help you.""



""Desmond—"" my mother started.



""No, Lillian,"" he cut her off firmly. ""This is our daughter and our grandchild. We will not abandon them.""



My mother stared at him for a long moment before her shoulders slumped. She moved to sit on my other side, taking my hand from Natalie.



""Your father's right,"" she said quietly. ""It won't be easy, but we'll figure this out together. You'll continue college—""



""But the baby—"" I protested.



""Will have three adults to care for him or her while you're in class,"" Mom finished. ""Your education is non-negotiable, Monica. That child will need a mother who can provide.""



Fresh tears spilled down my cheeks, but this time from overwhelming gratitude. ""Thank you,"" I whispered. ""I don't deserve this.""



Dad squeezed my shoulder. ""Family stands together, especially when times are tough.""



Later that night, lying in my childhood bed, I placed my hand on my stomach, imagining the tiny life growing inside me. A boy, perhaps, with those unforgettable violet-blue eyes. Or a girl with my dark hair.



""I'll name you Austin if you're a boy,"" I whispered into the darkness, thinking of my grandfather who had always believed in me. ""And I promise, no matter what happens, you will always be loved.""



For the first time since the doctor's pronouncement, a sense of peace washed over me. The path ahead would be difficult, filled with challenges I couldn't yet imagine, but I wouldn't walk it alone. I had my parents, I had Natalie, and most importantly, I had this new life to fight for.



My hand still resting protectively over my stomach, I drifted off to sleep, dreaming of tiny hands and those haunting violet-blue eyes.

...



Monica's POV



Two years had passed in a whirlwind of sleepless nights, diaper changes, and college assignments. Somehow, I'd managed to graduate with my business degree while raising my beautiful little boy. As I watched Austin playing with his toy cars on the living room floor, my heart swelled with love. His violet-blue eyes—so hauntingly familiar—sparkled with joy as he smashed two cars together with dramatic sound effects.



""Boom! Big crash, Mama!"" he exclaimed, his chubby hands waving excitedly.



""That's quite the accident, sweetheart,"" I laughed, smoothing his dark curls. At two years old, he was the spitting image of the stranger from the masquerade ball—a constant reminder of that one night that had changed everything.



My phone buzzed with a text from Diego Carson, my boss at the construction company and Natalie's brother.



Need to talk to you when you have a minute. Good news.



I frowned, curious. Diego had been incredibly supportive since Austin was born, giving me flexible hours and even setting up a small play area in a corner of the office for days when my parents couldn't watch him.



""Come on, baby,"" I said, scooping Austin up. ""Let's go see what Uncle Diego wants.""



Twenty minutes later, I sat across from Diego in his cluttered office, Austin contentedly drawing on some construction paper nearby.



""Monica,"" Diego began, leaning forward on his desk, ""you know I value your work here, but we need to be honest—this isn't your field.""



My stomach tightened. Was I being fired? ""I know the economy's tight—""



""No, no,"" he waved his hand dismissively. ""I'm not letting you go. I'm trying to push you out of the nest."" His kind eyes crinkled at the corners. ""You graduated with honors in business administration. You shouldn't be filing paperwork at a construction company.""



Relief flooded through me, followed by uncertainty. ""This job gives me flexibility with Austin—""



""And any decent company will accommodate a single mother with your qualifications,"" he interrupted. ""You deserve better pay, better benefits. That little boy deserves more than what this small company can offer you.""



I glanced at Austin, who was now attempting to eat a crayon. ""I wouldn't even know where to start looking.""



Diego smiled, sliding a folded newspaper across the desk. ""That's where I come in. Or rather, where my father comes in.""



The newspaper was opened to a circled job listing: Executive Assistant to the CEO, Lorenzo Group.



My eyes widened. ""Lorenzo Group? The multinational corporation? Diego, that's way beyond my experience level!""



""Dad agrees. He's golfing buddies with someone on their board. He can get you a virtual interview.""



""But—""



""No buts,"" Diego cut me off firmly. ""Dad already called them. The interview is tomorrow at 10 AM. Their headquarters is in Paradise Port. If you get it, you'd have to relocate, but the salary is triple what I pay you.""



My mind raced. Paradise Port was three hours away—far from the gossip of my hometown where people still whispered about ""poor Monica"" and her ""mysterious pregnancy."" Far from Grace and Tyler, who had gotten married three years ago in a spectacle of a wedding that my entire family had attended except for me.



""I don't know, Diego...""



""Just take the interview. What's the worst that could happen? They say no, and you're right back where you started.""



That night, after putting Austin to bed, I called Natalie for our nightly chat. As always, she answered on the first ring.



""Did you accept the interview?"" she demanded without preamble.



I sighed, sinking onto my bed. ""Hello to you too.""



""Skip the pleasantries. Dad's been blowing up my phone all evening. You're taking that interview, Monica, if I have to drag you there myself.""



""It's virtual,"" I pointed out dryly.



""Then I'll prop you up in front of the camera and work your arms like a puppet. This is your chance!""



I laughed despite myself. ""Fine, fine! I'll do the interview. But Natalie, it's in Paradise Port. If by some miracle they hire me—""



""Then you'll pack your bags and go,"" she interrupted. ""What's keeping you here besides your parents? And they'd want this for you.""



She wasn't wrong. My parents had been incredible, helping with Austin while I finished school, never once making me feel like a burden despite the financial strain. But lately, I'd noticed my mother's tight expression whenever my aunt mentioned Grace's ""perfect life"" or when my father had to work overtime to help cover Austin's daycare expenses.



""I'd be all alone in a new city with a toddler,"" I whispered, voicing my deepest fear.



Natalie was quiet for a moment. ""Actually... there's something I've been meaning to tell you.""



The next morning, I sat nervously in front of my laptop, wearing a freshly ironed blouse and having arranged for my mom to take Austin to the park. The Lorenzo Group logo appeared on my screen as the video call connected.



A beautiful, elegant woman in her fifties appeared, her silver-streaked dark hair pulled into a sophisticated chignon. Her smile was warm and immediate.



""Monica Hayes? I'm Paula Williams. I've been Mr. Lorenzo's executive assistant for thirty years, and I'm about to retire. I'm personally handling the search for my replacement. Thank you for joining us today.""



I returned her smile, trying to steady my nerves. ""Thank you for this opportunity, Mrs. Williams.""



""Please, call me Paula."" She shuffled some papers on her desk. ""Abel Carson speaks very highly of you. He says you're the most organized and efficient person he knows, besides his wife.""



I laughed, relaxing slightly. ""Mr. Carson is very kind.""



""He's not known for empty compliments,"" she replied with a knowing smile. ""Now, tell me about yourself and why you're interested in this position.""



For the next hour, we discussed my experience, education, and the requirements of being an executive assistant to the CEO. I was honest about my situation as a single mother, bracing myself for the polite rejection that would surely follow.



Instead, Paula's expression softened. ""We offer excellent childcare benefits, Monica. Many of our executives are parents. Mr. Lorenzo expects dedication and excellence, but he's not unreasonable about family commitments.""



""Mr. Lorenzo sounds... understanding,"" I ventured, though something in her careful phrasing made me wonder.



A hint of amusement flashed in Paula's eyes. ""He's... demanding. Brilliant but impatient. The executive floor has gone through three assistants in the past year.""



My heart sank. ""I see.""



""But,"" she continued, studying me intently, ""something tells me you might be different. You strike me as someone who doesn't back down easily.""



I thought about the past two years—balancing midnight feedings with term papers, facing down judgmental stares at the grocery store, building a life for my son despite everything. ""I'm not easily intimidated,"" I agreed.



Paula smiled broadly. ""Then I'd like to offer you the position, Monica. Starting salary is $85,000 with comprehensive benefits. We can provide temporary housing for your first month while you find a suitable place to live. When can you start?""



I stared at her in shock. ""You're offering me the job? Just like that?""



""Abel Carson vouched for you. I trust his judgment. And I've learned to trust my instincts over the years."" She paused. ""We need someone who can start in two weeks. Is that doable?""



Two weeks to uproot my life and move to a new city. Two weeks to find childcare for Austin, pack our belongings, say goodbye to my parents...



""Yes,"" I heard myself say. ""I can start in two weeks.""



After the call ended, I sat in stunned silence until my mother returned with a tired but happy Austin. As she helped him take off his shoes, she noticed my expression.



""Monica? What's wrong?""



""I got the job,"" I whispered. ""At Lorenzo Group. In Paradise Port.""



My mother's hands stilled. For a moment, I saw grief flash across her face before she composed herself, putting on a brave smile. ""Oh, honey, that's wonderful news!""



""Mom, I don't have to take it—""



""Nonsense,"" she cut me off firmly. ""This is exactly what you need. A fresh start, away from all the gossip and judgment. A chance to build something for you and Austin."" She pulled me into a tight hug. ""Your father and I will miss you both terribly, but we're just a three-hour drive away.""



Later that evening, Natalie came bursting through my front door without knocking, as usual.



""You got it!"" she shrieked, wrapping me in a bone-crushing hug. ""I knew you would!""



""How did you know already?"" I laughed, extracting myself from her grip.



""Dad called me the minute he heard from his contact."" She flopped onto my couch dramatically. ""Now, about Paradise Port...""



""I know, I know. It's going to be hard starting over alone, but—""



""That's what I've been trying to tell you!"" Natalie interrupted, practically bouncing with excitement. ""You won't be alone!""



I stared at her, confused. ""What are you talking about?""



""I got a job at Lynx World's Paradise Port office!"" she exclaimed. ""Their HR department practically begged me to transfer. And Jasper's coming too! His company has an office there!""



""But... your apartment, your life here...""



Natalie waved dismissively. ""Already taken care of. We've been planning this for months, waiting for the right opportunity for you.""



""Months?"" I gaped at her. ""You've been plotting to relocate us all to Paradise Port for months?""



She had the grace to look slightly sheepish. ""We knew you'd never leave your parents without a really good reason. The Lorenzo Group job was too perfect to pass up.""



Tears filled my eyes. ""You're moving your entire life for me?""



""Don't be so dramatic,"" Natalie rolled her eyes, though her own were suspiciously bright. ""We're moving our lives WITH you. There's a difference."" She pulled out her phone. ""Now, about apartments. I've already found the perfect place—three bedrooms, modern kitchen, secured building with a playground nearby. Jasper and I can take one bedroom, you and Austin take the master, and we'll use the third as a home office.""



""Natalie, I can't let you—""



""It's already done,"" she interrupted. ""Lease signed, deposit paid. We move in next Friday.""



Two weeks later, I stood in my newly furnished bedroom in Paradise Port, listening to Austin's soft breathing. He was asleep in his little bed, tucked into a corner we'd decorated with dinosaurs. The apartment was beautiful—far nicer than anything I could have afforded on my own. Natalie and Jasper had insisted on splitting the rent three ways, despite the master bedroom being significantly larger than their room.



""It comes with its own bathroom and a tiny human alarm clock at 6 AM,"" Natalie had joked. ""We're getting the better deal, trust me.""



I crossed to the closet and pulled out the box I'd carefully packed away two years ago—the box containing my mask, the red satin dress, and the perfume from the masquerade ball. I opened the bottle and hesitantly sprayed a small amount on my wrist, closing my eyes as the familiar scent washed over me.



For so long, I'd kept these items hidden away, too painful to look at yet impossible to discard. But now, in this new city with this new life stretching before me, perhaps it was time to stop hiding.



I placed the perfume on my dresser where I'd see it every morning—a reminder of both the mistakes and miracles that had led me here. The mask and dress went back in the box, tucked safely in the closet. Some memories were still too raw to display.



Tomorrow, I would start my new job at Lorenzo Group. I would meet the demanding, brilliant CEO who had gone through three assistants in a year. I would prove to everyone—especially myself—that Monica Hayes was more than capable of handling whatever challenges came her way.



I touched the perfume bottle one last time, thinking of violet-blue eyes and the night that had changed everything.



""Ready or not,"" I whispered to myself, ""here we go.""",1,1756792806.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

1n6boou,https://www.reddit.com/r/googleworkspace/comments/1n6boou/frustrated/,Frustrated,"So, my company Workspace account got hacked yesterday. I’m a small business owner and my account was the administrator account.

I spoke to one of my clients who happens to be a cybersecurity expert and his bet is I probably accessed a compromised website with the “Sign Up with Google” feature, which admittedly I’ve done A LOT of in the last few days as were in the market for a specific service and I’m testing a lot of options.

I can’t describe just how traumatic it all was. I was away from my desk for all of 10 minutes making coffee and returned to find over 20 emails sent to my other business email (I’ve got forwarding active and the other email is my recovery email).

The hackers managed to change my recovery email, my recovery phone number, removed my passkey, turned off Advanced Protection, generated new backup codes — essentially locking me out of my account, which conveniently meant I couldn’t contact Workspace support. I do have Google One on my personal email, so I spoke to them and they recommended I contact Workspace sales and that I will hear back in 3 days or so. Obviously, I thought this was stupid. The hacked Workspace account has several business credit cards hooked up, I was verified and running Google Ads, and I had a ton of APIs + obviously my client’s proprietary data/work.

In the end, the only way I could get in touch with Workspace support was to create a brand new Workspace account, which is ducking ridiculous.

I’ve also not regained access within the 4 hours that their website claims. It’s been nearly 18 hours and I’m still locked out (I’ve done everything they asked within the first hour including verification via DNS records etc). 

Fortunately, however, they’ve locked the account, so at least the hackers have been booted out.

I guess I’m posting this to remind you all to review your third party apps and services and delete all that are non-essential, test apps on a “burner” email account, and don’t think you’re protected because you have all the different MFAs switched on. I had them ALL and they didn’t help one bit.

Feel free to share any tips you have with me in the comments, as I’m 100% committed to making sure this never ever happens again and I’m also 100% sure I haven’t covered all bases.",1,1756792725.0,googleworkspace,2,1.0,False

""I'm game,"" Iris joined in. ""Ready when you are, Dash! For old time's sake.""

Then she puckered her lips and made a kissy sound at him.

I didn't say a word to my husband all the way home.

""You're overreacting,"" he kept saying when I refused to say a word. ""Zinnie, it was a joke.""

Inside my head, however, was a different story.

You used to date her. You saying you'd try to get a boy with her means you're unhappy we're having a girl.

Remember the joke at our wedding last time... his father said that he still can't forget Iris...

I had a horrible thought...they...?

""You're taking this too far,"" he accused me. ""You're the one that blew up at Iris and me, Zinnie. You ruined the night for everyone.""

He was making it sound like he and Iris were the couple, like they were an entity and I was the outsider.

I stood, clenched my hands. ""Affairs don't just happen. Pregnancy doesn't just happen. You chose this. Every step.""

He's silent.



————————



""You have the cupcakes?"" I asked my grandmother.

""I have them,"" she laughed. ""Stop worrying. Your mother's been driving me nuts trying to get me to tell her before the party. She hasn't changed -- even when she was a little girl, I'd catch her sneaking into my closet to try to find her Christmas presents.""

""I'm not sure how I'm going to make it through dinner knowing that once we get to dessert, Dash and I will know if we're having a boy or a girl.""

Dash's hand reached over and squeezed my thigh.

""You'll make it just fine,"" she said. ""Is he in the car with you?""

""Yeah. He's driving. He was actually able to get out of the hospital on time for once.""

""Well, I'll see you two soon for the big gender reveal,"" she said and ended the call.

.....

Everything had come to a screeching halt when I'd stood up so fast that my chair went flying backwards. Not an easy feat for a woman one month from her due date, but the chair was flat on the grass.

""What is that supposed to mean?"" I asked my husband sharply, and everyone around the table and standing around us in the backyard quieted, realizing that the pregnant woman wasn't laughing.

""Nothing,"" Dash said. ""It was a joke.""

""A joke? You think something like that's a joke?""

""Yeah, Zinnie, a joke.""

""I didn't think it was very funny to joke about getting my sister pregnant.""

""Zinnie --""

I looked at my sister next. ""And I don't think it was funny that you went along with it and brought up ancient history.""

Dash and Iris had dated in their senior year of high school and broke up when they went to college. Looking between them, ignoring the uncomfortable silence in the backyard, I had a horrible thought, one that I'd never worried about before, but now, after their comments...

""Or is it ancient history?""

There were gasps all around the table, and my mother said my name sharply.

""Zinnia, you need to stop. It was just a joke.""

Instead of sitting down or answering her, I turned to Dash. ""I want to leave. Now.""

""Zinnie, stop being --"" he said, his face flushed from anger.

Stop being what?

""Now, Dash! I want to leave now."" I looked at my grandmother. ""Thank you for making the cupcakes.""

I walked out of the backyard to the front, not bothering to see if he'd follow. If he didn't, I had my own set of car keys and I'd leave him here. Maybe tell him it was just a joke. Ha, ha, screwing ha. Maybe my sister could give him a ride home, and he could get her pregnant in the backseat of her car.

But he was right behind me, angry, and he let me know that without saying a word by not opening the car door for me like he always did. Not a problem. I slammed his precious car door a little too hard, and although I felt his eyes snap at me, he didn't say a word.

The time to have kept his mouth shut would have been after everyone was watching us bite into our cupcakes, waiting in anticipation to see if we were having a boy or a girl. I saw the pink filling and immediately squealed. Honestly, I would have squealed either way -- I was just excited knowing what we were having. We'd decided to wait for the gender reveal until everyone on both sides could make it, which is why we were only finding out a month before I was due.

Seeing that pink filling, I turned to Dash, only to see him with an odd look on his face -- disappointment? In fact, everyone around the table was quiet and no one seemed excited except for my grandmother.

""We're having a girl!"" I enthused, although it sounded awkward. I wondered if that would shake him out of his funk.

""Yeah,"" he said, and now the disappointment wasn't just on his face but in his voice, too. He'd put the cupcake down and pushed the plate away as if it offended him.

My mother stepped in. ""Well, if at first you don't get it right, try, try again.""

Get it right? What? Who said that at a gender reveal?

Dash gave a half smile at my mother, then he looked at my sister and grinned. ""Why wait another two-and-a-half months? I'll just get Iris pregnant.""

Unbelievably, all my relatives roared at that. They couldn't rejoice in a little girl, but they could laugh uproariously at a horrible, tactless comment. For a minute, I hoped I'd been adopted so I wasn't related by blood to these people, but then I was distracted by the feeling that my stomach was going to revolt.

""I'm game,"" Iris joined in. ""Ready when you are, Dash! For old time's sake.""

Then she puckered her lips and made a kissy sound at him.

She'd actually brought up the time when she and Dash had dated almost fifteen years ago? What was going on here?

That was when I'd stood up abruptly and sent my chair flying.

.....

I didn't say a word to my husband all the way home, even though once we pulled out of the driveway, he decided to talk to me. Inside my head, however, was a different story.

""You're overreacting,"" he kept saying when I refused to say a word. ""Zinnie, it was a joke.""You're supposed to laugh if it's a joke.

""I wouldn't actually try to get your sister pregnant.""

You used to date her. You saying you'd try to get a boy with her means you're unhappy we're having a girl. And talking about cheating on me with my sister? So nasty. So inappropriate.

""Everyone but you took it as a joke.""

It still doesn't mean it was an appropriate joke to make. It was completely gross.

He gave up trying to talk with me after he told me he didn't know why I was so upset about a joke.

I couldn't bear the thought of sleeping next to him, so I got ready for bed in the guest bathroom and went to the tiny third bedroom where we had a full size bed. Exhaustion hit me as he followed me into the room.

""You're taking this too far,"" he accused me. Me!

Pulling back the covers, I lay on my left side, my back to him.

""Come sleep in our bed,"" he tried coaxing me. ""You're spiraling out of control for what was nothing more than a joke. Do you honestly think I'd sleep with your sister?""

""I don't know what to think anymore,"" I said in reply to that opening he gave me. ""Thanks to your so-called joke, I'm now thinking you may be cheating on me with my sister or at the least thinking about it or her since you're talking about getting her pregnant. I now know you're disappointed we're having a girl. I now have to wonder if you never really got over my sister and you married me to stay close to her. I now know neither of you gives a screw about my feelings since you sided together against me to make the joke.""

""Do you hear yourself, Zinnie? All that from a joke? Not sure when you lost your sense of humor, but I'm not going to keep trying to defend myself when you're the only one who didn't get the joke.""

Keep fighting your corner. I just told you how I felt, and you're dismissing what I said and everything I felt.

In case I missed it from the exasperation in his voice, he slammed the door to the bedroom to let me know how displeased he was. Since I couldn't sleep, I rested my body but my mind was getting a workout.

I was married to a man who thought it was funny to share his disappointment that our baby was a girl, a disappointment that I never knew about. I was married to a man who thought joking about cheating on me with my sister, who was his ex, was a joke. My own sister thought it was funny to go along with it and ask if he wanted to get started after dinner. I was the spawn of two people who chastised me for getting mad at my husband and sister for making such a horrible, tasteless joke.

Maybe it was the hormones but I remembered another so-called joke, this time made by Dash's very drunk father, at our rehearsal dinner.

""We're glad the two of you have found happiness in your own way. We never thought he'd get over his first love, but hey! Even if he didn't, you're the one he's marrying so that's just about first place!""

While everyone was laughing, I'd gotten up from the table and walked away, knowing Dash's first love was my sister. Dash had hurried after me, apologizing for what his father said, but then he'd told me it was just a joke, and I needed to come back in so I didn't ruin the evening and make his dad feel bad. Since the wedding was so close, because I didn't want there to be strained relations at our wedding, I went back and made amends.

Now, I was tired of jokes. I was tired of being told I was the one with the problem. I was tired of having to swallow down so-called jokes to keep the peace. I should have walked away after that rehearsal dinner and not married Dash. Then I wouldn't be in this situation right now.

No, I was the peacemaker, the one who put up with it so I wouldn't rock the boat. So no one would feel uncomfortable. So everyone would be happy. So someone else -- namely Iris -- could shine with her more outgoing, demanding personality.

It wasn't OK when it just me but I'd allowed it like a chump since I never wanted to make waves. Now, however, I was thinking about my daughter – apparently, I was the only one who wanted her – and what my lack of a spine would teach her. No lesson I wanted her to learn.

Think, Zinnia. What if she came to me and told me this, that her husband had made a terrible joke about impregnating her sister?

""I'd tell her to stop taking it and leave him until he could change his attitude and see why it was wrong,"" I whispered out loud in the darkness.

A whisper in the dark can be more powerful than a shout in the daylight.

Where could I go? Not to my parents. Not to my sister. I was going no contact for a while with them. I was one month from my due date, and since I worked from home as a medical transcriptionist, I was portable. I could work anywhere. I suddenly realized where I could go if my husband wouldn't leave our home.

......

The next morning, I was sitting at the kitchen table with my morning tea. I'd never been much of a coffee drinker, which my husband couldn't understand. He came into the kitchen about half an hour later, ready for work, tie straight, the young doctor ready to see patients.

He immediately spied his phone on the table.

""I took it while you were in the shower,"" I explained.

Yeah, I figured that I'd admit it right up front, and I didn't even care if it was wrong. If he was going to make jokes about impregnating his former girlfriend and then try to minimize how much it had hurt me by saying it was a joke, I was going to search for answers on my own.

""Unfortunately, I couldn't get into it since you changed your passcode.""

""Why are you trying to go through my phone?""

""Why wouldn't I be able to go through your phone, Dash?""

""You'd have a fit if I tried to go through your phone.""

Avoid. Deflect. Not helping to reassure me.

""No, I wouldn't because I have nothing to hide."" I pushed my phone across the table to him. ""You know the passcode. I haven't felt the need to change it.""

""This is bulshit.""

""Open your phone and let me see your texts.""

""No. It's the principle of the thing. I'm not letting you see my texts.""

As I'd expected. Still a blow, but not altogether surprising. People only protected their phones when they had something to hide.

""I wanted to talk last night over with you. See if you'd realize how awful your so-called joke was and give you a chance to apologize.""

""You're the one that blew up at Iris and me, Zinnie. You're the one that couldn't take a joke and ruined the night for everyone.""

He was making it sound like he and Iris were the couple, like they were an entity and I was the outsider.

But the man I'd been sharing my life with… wasn't who I thought he was.  
  
My body went stiff as I overheard his voice from outside our bedroom door. He was on the phone.  
  
""Ethan, even if you hated Sarah, six months of her sleeping with a stranger is punishment enough. Especially since her blindness was your fault to begin with.""  
  
My boyfriend's reply was cold, almost bored. ""She's the one who insisted on saving me. I only stayed with her because she looks like Vivian.""  
  
""Now I'm marrying Vivian. You take Sarah. You're twins—a blind girl wouldn't know the difference anyway.""  
  
I started shaking. A cold dread washed over me.  
  
Everything I thought was real… was a lie.  
  
""Ethan, Sarah's pregnant. It's your child. Don't you think you should see her?""  
  
He didn't even hesitate. ""You're my brother. The kid will carry the Carter name regardless. He can call you Dad. Same difference.""  
  
The man on the other end—Andrew—sounded frustrated. ""That's not right, Ethan. Sarah's actually happy about the baby. You're the father.""  
  
Ethan's voice turned icy. ""Drop it, Andrew. The only woman for me is Vivian. If Sarah hadn't clung to me, Vivian never would've left the country. You know how she is—she hates sharing. Sleeping with a different guy every night was my punishment to her.""  
  
There was a pause. ""Fine. I'll come by later to pick up my birth certificate. Don't tell anyone about me and Vivian getting married.""  
  
I lay in bed, staring blankly at the ceiling, biting my lip hard to keep from making a sound. All the joy I'd felt since losing my sight… it was all an illusion.  
  
I'd just found out I was pregnant today. ""Ethan"" had seemed over the moon.  
  
But now I knew—it wasn't Ethan who was happy.  
  
He felt no remorse for what happened to me.  
  
He'd swapped places with his own brother just to punish me for loving him—all for his precious Vivian.  
  
For half a year, I'd lived with a stranger. I tried so hard to make him happy.  
  
Tears spilled from my eyes. I couldn't hold back the quiet sobs.  
  
Hearing me cry, the man rushed into the room, concern written all over his face.  
  
""Sarah, you're awake? You should be resting.""  
  
I didn't answer. I just cried.  
  
He looked almost identical to Ethan. His voice was soft, gentle—but now that I listened closely, I could hear the slight differences. He'd been mimicking him.  
  
""Why are you crying? Bad dream?""  
  
He pulled me into his arms like he always did. I should've known.  
  
The real Ethan was distant, cold. He wouldn't have changed overnight just because I went blind.  
  
The worry on this man's face seemed so real. It only made my heart break more.  
  
""Yes,"" I whispered. ""I dreamed you were lying to me.""  
  
He went still for a second. Then he brushed my hair gently. ""I would never lie to you, Sarah. You're emotional because of the pregnancy. I'll always be here.""  
  
""What if… I never see again?""  
  
His answer came a little too quickly. ""Then I'll stay with you. Forever.""  
  
I could almost hear the hope in his voice.  
  
Tears rolled down my cheeks silently.  
  
""Ethan… do you really love me? Lately, you feel… different.""  
  
He froze. Guilt flashed across his face. ""Have I ever lied to you, Sarah?""  
  
His phone buzzed. He glanced at it, and his expression shifted.  
  
""Alright, sweetheart, don't overthink it. I'll go warm some milk for you.""  
  
Ethan… how could you do this to me?  
  
I cried quietly until he left the room.  
  
Then I grabbed my phone—my vision was back, and I could finally use it.  
  
The first thing I saw was a post from Vivian.  
  
She was flaunting 999 roses. And there was Ethan—the real Ethan—on his knees, kissing her toes.  
  
The sight hit me like a physical blow.  
  
Ethan never bowed to anyone. He hated being vulnerable. And he was obsessed with cleanliness.  
  
My chest ached.  
  
Just then, the door opened.  
  
Ethan walked in. The real one.  
  
He held a glass of milk, a cigarette dangling from his lips, a mocking smirk on his face.  
  
And right behind him… was Vivian.  
  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
I sat on the edge of the bed, my voice trembling as I called out, ""Ethan?""  
  
He didn't answer.  
  
I stumbled out of bed, my legs giving way beneath me, and fell straight into his arms. An unexplainable ache tightened in my chest, making my nose sting.  
  
His breathing was rough as he caught me, his voice strained with helplessness. ""Sarah, please—when you can't see, you have to be more careful.""  
  
Vivian, standing beside him, radiated displeasure. Ethan quickly released me, and in an instant, she pressed a hard kiss against his cheek—a blatant show of possession. She stuck her tongue out at me, then mouthed to Ethan with exaggerated slowness, ""Oops, I forgot. She's blind.""  
  
Instinctively, I kept my regained sight a secret.  
  
Ethan's brow furrowed, but his gaze toward Vivian remained tender.  
  
To my shock, Vivian wrapped her arms around him and kissed him deeply, right in front of me. Ethan seemed to hesitate, pulling back slightly as if to say this wasn't the time.  
  
Vivian pouted. ""What's the big deal? She can't see us. Don't you think it's a little exciting?""  
  
My eyes burned. I clenched my fists so hard my nails dug into my palms.  
  
The next moment, they tumbled onto the bed. Ethan was kissing her hungrily, lost in her.  
  
""Ethan,"" I cried out, my voice shaking. ""What are you doing?""  
  
Vivian shifted, pausing in a deliberate pose, and shot me a taunting look. Ethan groaned.  
  
""Nothing—I just… stubbed my leg while packing,"" I lied through gritted teeth.  
  
But I saw everything. They didn't even notice me watching, too wrapped up in each other. He was pulling her clothes off, his hands roaming everywhere, when Vivian's phone lit up. She giggled and snapped a selfie.  
  
Ethan might've kept going if his phone hadn't started ringing insistently. He finally stopped.  
  
My hands were clenched so tight they hurt.  
  
He walked past me, Vivian tucked under his arm, and frowned when he saw me on the floor. I'd fallen hard, but he didn't offer a hand—just gave me a cold look and walked away without a word.  
  
Another man stood in the doorway—Andrew, Ethan's twin. He spoke softly, ""Ethan, isn't this too cruel?""  
  
Ethan's voice was ice. ""Why feel sorry for a woman like her? The colder you are, the sooner she'll let go."" He paused, then added, ""Vivian and I are getting married the day after tomorrow. Bring Sarah to the courthouse. Let her watch—it's what she deserves.""  
  
Then he kissed Vivian again, right in front of me.  
  
Andrew hesitated but finally nodded.  
  
Ethan left without a backward glance, Vivian clinging to his side.  
  
I felt all the blood drain from my face.  
  
Andrew—the other Ethan—came in and helped me up gently. ""Sarah, you're still such a kid. The floor is cold. You shouldn't sit there.""  
  
He looked exactly like Ethan, but his touch was kinder. For a moment, I felt completely lost.  
  
Which Ethan did I really love?  
  
I couldn't sleep that night, even after Andrew drifted off beside me. I slipped into the bathroom with my phone, my newly restored eyes still sensitive to the light.  
  
With trembling hands, I scrolled through message after message from Vivian.  
  
They were all photos—selfies of her and Ethan in bed. Ethan, always so proud and untouchable, was wrapped around her finger. She'd left love bites across his neck, lipstick stains on his collar.  
  
I remembered once when I accidentally got a little dirt on his shirt—he didn't speak to me for three days.  
  
Tears fell silently as I kept scrolling. Each image was another cut.  
  
Then I found a video.  
  
I pressed play.  
  
They were kissing deeply. Ethan's hands were all over her. Vivian's voice came through, sweet and mocking: ""Ethan, what about your little girlfriend? Do you love me or her?""  
  
His voice was thick with desire. ""Vivian, you're the only one I love. She was just a placeholder. Now I've passed her to my brother.""  
  
Vivian giggled in satisfaction. Then the camera shifted—Ethan smiled and knelt before her.  
  
Watching that, my whole body went cold.  
  
The last message from Vivian read: ""Sarah, the one who isn't loved is the real third wheel. You lost.""  
  
I sat there in the dim light, finally understanding.  
  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
He pulled me back just before a car could hit me. His hand was bleeding, but all he cared about was whether I was okay.  
  
After that, we kept running into each other—on campus, at the coffee shop, near the library. It felt like fate.  
  
I came from a struggling family and worked multiple part-time jobs to get by. When he found out I was scared of walking home alone at night, he started picking me up after my shifts. He'd walk me back under the streetlights, glaring down anyone who looked my way a little too long.  
  
He told me, ""Sarah, you're pure and good. You deserve to be loved—to be cherished.""  
  
We fell in love, naturally. It felt right.  
  
But today he told me my purity was a sin. That having to sleep with a stranger every night was my punishment.  
  
Only now do I understand. It was never love at first sight. I just look like her.  
  
I cried until my tears ran dry.  
  
After a sleepless night, my eyes were red and swollen, but my mind was clear. I had made my decision.  
  
Fake Ethan woke up sometime during the night. Sleepy-eyed, he pulled me gently into his arms.  
  
""Why are you up so early?"" he mumbled.  
  
I clung to that moment of tenderness, fragile as it was. ""I couldn't sleep. I was thinking about the past.""  
  
He wiped my tears away, his touch awkward but earnest. ""Don't look back, look forward. I'll always be with you.""  
  
I nodded quietly.  
  
After a pause, he said, ""Let's celebrate your birthday at home tonight. I have a surprise for you.""  
  
He brought out my favorite strawberry cake and a huge bouquet of 999 strawberry flowers. Even though I couldn't see the decorations, I could feel the effort he put into making everything perfect.  
  
Watching him bustle around, so excited to make the evening special, I felt my eyes well up again.  
  
What if things had been different? What if he had been the one from the beginning?  
  
Just as we were about to blow out the candles, he got up suddenly. ""Wait—there's one more thing.""  
  
He opened the door, and the real Ethan walked in, reluctant and stiff.  
  
I froze. I never expected him to come.  
  
He was holding a giant hamburger-shaped cake. ""I remember you always wanted something quirky. I had this custom-made for you.""  
  
He sat beside me, guiding my hand to touch it. ""Come on, let's blow out the candles.""  
  
Just like that, my resolve began to crumble. He remembered. He still cared.  
  
Blushing, I leaned in and made a wish with him—for a future full of happiness.  
  
The man by the door sighed softly and left.  
  
Ethan was unusually gentle that night, almost as if he hadn't been the one to break me over and over. I was losing myself in his kindness again.  
  
But then his hand slid up my thigh, slowly wandering higher.  
  
I jolted back to reality, biting my lip and shaking my head. ""Please don't.""  
  
He frowned but kept his voice soft. ""Sarah, it's been so long since we…""  
  
His hands grew more insistent.  
  
I pressed my hand over my stomach, eyes brimming. ""I'm pregnant. Have you forgotten?""  
  
His expression turned cold instantly. He let go of me.  
  
My heart, which had just begun to warm, turned to ice.  
  
So he came just to humiliate me. Was that all I was to him? A thing to use?  
  
I smiled bitterly.  
  
He stood up, gritted his teeth, and walked toward the door. Before leaving, he spoke without turning around, his voice icy.  
  
""Don't blame me for being cruel, Andrew. You're the one who begged me to come back.""  
  
Then, under his breath, he added, ""She really thinks she's special. How pathetic."" A little louder, he said, ""Don't forget—take her to the courthouse tomorrow.""  
  
  
  
Chapter 4  
  
Andrew didn't answer. He just closed the door, stepped inside, and offered an apologetic smile.  
  
""I'm sorry, Sarah. This is on me. If you're not comfortable with it, I won't push you. Please don't cry.""  
  
He reached for me, and I instinctively pulled back.  
  
Watching the two brothers team up like this almost made me laugh.  
  
""I'll take you somewhere to relax tomorrow, Sarah. You deserve to be happy.""  
  
He tried to pull me into a hug, but I slipped away.  
  
Andrew let out a defeated sigh but didn't press further. ""Get some rest.""  
  
I turned silently toward the window, my tears already dry.  
  
Then another message from Vivian came through.  
  
This time, it was a photo of her and Ethan holding hands, the ring on her finger screaming their status.  
  
I remember once thinking about marrying Ethan.  
  
But he told me he was too young, that he wanted to focus on his career—that relationships would only tie him down.  
  
I stayed quiet after that and never brought it up again.  
  
But now, seeing his radiant smile in that picture, I knew the truth: he did want to get married. Just not to me.  
  
Early the next morning, I sent Andrew away, telling him I was craving those steamed buns from South Street.  
  
Andrew almost always gave in to me.  
  
If it weren't for Ethan… I might've fallen for him.  
  
He ruffled my hair gently. ""The way you were last night—I thought you hated me.""  
  
""Can you go by yourself later? I'm still worried.""  
  
I forced a smile. ""Of course I can. What, you think I'm three? I'll take a cab.""  
  
After making sure again and again that I'd be fine, he finally left, somewhat reassured.  
  
I got up and looked around the apartment I'd called home for almost four years. My throat tightened.  
  
It was time to end this.  
  
Time to let this mistaken relationship fade for good.  
  
I packed my things and called the movers. I'd been scouting new places ever since my sight returned.  
  
Arizona has great weather, and plenty of the flowers I love.  
  
It seemed like a good place for a fresh start.  
  
I booked an appointment with an OB-GYN there and headed out.  
  
Just then, Andrew called again. ""Sarah, are you in the cab yet? Be careful—I'm already on my way.""  
  
He was clever. The location he gave me was a park near the courthouse.  
  
My voice was soft. ""Yeah, I'm heading out soon.""  
  
I could hear the relief in his tone. ""Hurry up, then.""  
  
After hanging up, I saw Vivian's latest post:  
  
""Groom's looking handsome today! He says he's finally making me his wife!""  
  
In the photo, he was devoutly kissing her hand.  
  
Another message from Vivian came through:  
  
""The understudy's role is over, Sarah. You're kind of pitiful, honestly—but I won't pity you. Your part is done.""  
  
I didn't reply. I just quietly blocked her number.  
  
Before boarding the plane, Andrew kept calling.  
  
""Andrew… thank you for weaving such a beautiful dream for me.""  
  
I found Ethan's number and sent him one last wish for happiness.  
  
Then I blocked everyone, turned on airplane mode, and felt a peace I hadn't known in years.  
  
At the courthouse, Andrew got the news and his mind went blank. How did she find out who he really was?  
  
Ethan and Vivian arrived late. He'd had a sinking feeling ever since getting word about Sarah's birthday.  
  
They waited a half hour.  
  
Andrew was pale. A ridiculous, terrifying thought crossed his mind, and his lips began to tremble.  
  
""Ethan—something's wrong. Sarah knows. She's gone.""

1n6bhhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1n6bhhk/til_you_can_easily_make_plant_milks_from_powders/,TIL: You can easily make plant milks from powders,"I usually buy Anthony's brand vital wheat gluten powder but I usually found it a little cheaper on eBay (from reputable authorized resellers, not some mystery bag of it) but Anthony's website was offering free shipping and it was cheaper and I never knew how many products they have and noticed they have Oat Milk Powder and then realized why not just mix that with water and can see the rather simple other ingredients that make up most oat milks (basically just calcium, Sunflower Lecithin keeps it smooth, plant gums to make it creamy, and vitamins to fortify which you don't really need if you already take B12/D etc separately).

They have coconut milk etc milk powders too which has a little more fat in it and saturated fat for a more creamy dairy type result, or just add more gums probably, actually the oat milk powder has coconut powder too likely adds the fat and makes it more usable as milk powder. Califia Farms is probably the best commercial plant milks because it's creamy and maybe the higher price justifies they use more nut powder but also it could be just be adding more gum.

Watching some Oat milk factory footage linked below, this is basically all they do to is use powders, they do heat it up through which kills potential whatevers and creates a longer shelf life but you probably don't have to heat up if DIY it from powders.

I've never had fresh, real oat/almond etc milk which is basically people just soak them then blend in a high speed blender and strain with a cheese cloth, and I'm sure that's great but basically never wanted to do that it seems like a whole process and waste of pulp unless you bake it into crackers/cookies etc.

I always knew commercial almond milks barely have any almonds in it because they can be costly/demanding to produce but I don't really have a preference for plant milks. I usually use it to make cheese sauce adding starch to oil like a roux first then adding salt spices etc. Every now and then I'll add it to coffee or cereal. And I've tried making pancakes with just water but it doesn't come out nearly as good as plant milk but basically again I think it's mostly because the gums/creaminess it adds.

$12 and prolly plus tax and shipping for 8oz of Oat Milk Powder doesn't sound cheap but I found it elsewhere cheaper for a pound and then add the missing coconut powder and whatever 'enzymes' is will figure out which the factory video says helps maintain creaminess.

Usually I just buy whatever's cheapest since I don't use plant milk that much but even oatley etc when it's on sale it's like water, so I'd rather just DIY it and add more gum/coconut or oat/soy/rice etc flour to make it creamier. Plus since I don't use it much it won't go to waste sometimes I'll buy a container of plant milk, make a cheese sauce for seitan cheesesteaks/ Mac n Cheese / hot pretzels etc and then sorta feel forced to finish the rest before it goes bad. With powders though basically just take a couple scoops put it in a shaker cup or blender and then use what you need and keep the rest in a carafe in the fridge. Probably ends up like 1/20th the price and still even better and creamier.

  
I usually buy unsweetened non vanilla for cheese sauce but can add sugar/vanilla easily.

In other words, these videos, unlike homemade fresh plant milks they aren't soaking nuts/grains and then straining them and adding additives, they're just using powders added to water and then adding additives:

edit: cooking prevents any bacteria from the field but the bagged powders you can buy online probably already go through a similar process similar with oatmeal that many people eat raw as overnight oats. But if you want to cook it without researching if the particular product is already heated it might reduces nutrients.

Before I start off with anything, I just want to remind everyone to please check up on your loved ones. Just a quick ‘how are you doing?’ text can mean so much. If you’re struggling please reach out to the various helplines. Remember that you matter and you are so much more than the trauma that you suffered through. You are so much more important than just a thorn that happened to cross your path. Please realize you matter so much. Ask for help, don’t be ashamed. You’re always loved. Please reach out. Enjoy what life has to offer.

One more thing to add, my post has gotten a few comments talking about karma farming, which I’m assuming is the upvotes on reddit. Unfortunately this isn’t a karma farming post and I don’t understand the concept? Is this money? I’m not sure what karma does for me. I never had a reddit account this is my first one so Im really unsure?

Onto what happened, long story short, my wife hated my sister, didn’t want me to help her in need, threatened to leave during pregnancy. I gave in and turned my sister away and basically found out my sister od’d. After a while, my mom showed me cruel texts of my wife telling my sister that my sisters miscarriage was karma.

After i posted to reddit, I closed the app and immediately went to bed. It was 3 and I was assigned an early morning shift. I didn’t have reddit notifications on and I never really used this app so I just completely forgot about my post. And I have to say that was for the best.

When I posted, I was vulnerable, distressed and in the midst of crying. I needed to speak to someone and get insight but I didn’t know who to call or text and so I decided on reddit, and unfortunately being behind a screen allows you to be incredibly cruel. A lot of you had a lot to say in terms of negative things about my sister. Alongside negative private messages which I will never reply to. Have some heart; she died.

A lot of people were incredibly kind though and I appreciate it all. I know in the original post I asked about whether I should stay and do counselling.. etc. Though truth be told, I knew I wouldn’t invest any more time in this relationship.

I was just in a vulnerable state and rambling but now my head is clear. Leaving her is my only option. I won’t really talk much about legal processes as I feel that’s very personal and I’m sure that’s boring to hear about. It’s generic and it’s tiring. And unfortunately very long. It won’t be a fast process.

I’ll be a good father and I swear that my baby girl will grow up and glow as bright as once my baby sister did. I will love my baby thrice as much as my heart can contain. I will love my baby enough for me, Maya and my sister. I don’t think I can get full custody and I’m not sure if I’d go out of my way to do this. I’ll explain more throughout this update.

I’ll also point out some common points that people bought up, not in order but just things that stuck with me.

1.	⁠how could I be with someone who justified my sister getting assaulted? I won’t provide excuses for Maya. She 100% played devils advocate, which she pretty much always does as she believes in keeping peace, or so she believes. However, I will say that my sister had asked me to apologize in her stead to Maya, which I did, she apologized back. Maya and my sister had a lengthy talk and they figured things out, that’s what I meant by ‘smoothed over’. We started keeping in touch after my sister and her slightly became friendly to each other. It wasn’t as if Maya was heartbroken to the point of playing damsel in distress, I simply put out what my sister asked of me, they talked, we talked, and it went on from there.
2.	⁠Did my sister ever do anything to make Maya hate her? I wouldn’t say so. Again, anything coming from me might be biased but I’m genuinely saying everything per my perception. My sister and Maya used to go out on coffee dates. They were cool with eachother. The issue is that while they were friendly with each other, their opinions often clashed. My wife makes pretty odd comments sometimes, especially in terms of politics, which sets my sister off. Not only that but my wife tends to often share her ‘controversial opinions’ which makes many people feel uncomfortable. I will add the fact that my sister does sometime get more and more agitated and then eventually becomes very emotional and argues with my wife, which also pisses her off. They argue until they calm down, and then they’re back to coffee dates. This was until we moved away from each other.
3.	⁠Does Maya know that I know about the texts? No she doesn’t and I’ll add more info on the bottom.
4.	⁠Is my sister known for being dramatic or causing anything bad with other people?

Absolutely not. She is, was, one of the most gentle and kind human beings. She was incredibly sweet and loveable. She was surrounded by people who adored her. You wouldn’t believe the amount of people who cried during her funeral. She was love amongst all of us and we know for sure that there’s another angel amongst the sky. She can be a little sensitive when insulted, but who isn’t?

5. was my sister groomed? No, my sister has a late birthday (november 6) and my wife and lina have very early birthdays (jan, mar) which is why it seems that their age gap is very far. The guy is about the same age, same year as Lina and Maya, i’m not sure about his birthday at all.

Last question, which everyone was wondering, ‘Why would I marry Maya if she was like this’.

If you read through this you’ll probably understand that my sister and her were okay on most terms, but Maya wasn’t anything like I imagined. I swear to god, a switch flipped. I genuienly feel this way. Maya is genuinely the type of person to drive 4 hours to see a sick relative, take care of them, make them soup, etc. She has a mini library in our front garden (not fully sure what those are called) and neighborhood kids borrow books and return them all the time. She’s very active in our community as well. Despite her incredibly negative traits, there were glimmer of incredible moments we had. I didn’t marry her out of stupidity. She truly was kind, loving and filled with brightness. Even my sister agreed, even though they had their arguments. My baby sister joked and said that she’s like the weather in our hometown , a reference to how the weather just randomly goes from cold to warm, sunny to gloomy. When she’s kind, she loves a lot, but shes also incredibly stubborn. She can’t accept being wrong, she can’t accept being called out, she can’t accept criticism of any kind. But we had our moments. We really did.

Now as per the actual update, once I gathered my thoughts, I finally talked to my wife. I needed someone to cry to but in a sense it was slightly a bait. I wanted to see if she’d admit to texting my sister, if she’d come out of her way to apologize or if she’d just pretend as if it didn’t happen. Unfortunately it was the latter and it was much worse than I assumed.

I mentioned in my post earlier that my mom called me and explained what cruel things my wife has said, but I didn’t see the texts myself. And if i wanted to confront Maya to make sure she can’t deny it, I had to get photo proof. I asked my mom for screenshots and I had them sent over promptly.

I will not type out the whole extent of it, but to shorten it, my mom had given maya so much more grace. What she had said was so much more fucking cruel. There was paragraph after paragraph. It wasn’t just a small tiny bit of text, but rather dozens of paragraph essentially saying my sister deserved everything that happened to her, except there were much more details that I won’t mention. My sisters vulnerable moments were all presented in those texts, alongside information i’m assuming she told Maya while they were out alone because I had no clue, essentially every bad thing that has ever happened to my sister was highlighted there.

I felt so much more sick reading it and I couldn’t imagine why she’d continue hanging out with my sister if she hated her this much. I pretty much broke down crying again.

I haven’t cried this hard since my sister’s death, and I think it caught up to me. While this is a huge violation of her privacy and I take blame for it, I ended up going through my wife’s phone just to see if there was anything but no, her instagram interactions with my sister were all pleasant and there were no recent interactions on there however, when i checked her regular messaging app, my sisters contact was deleted. She forgot to delete the recently deleted which allowed me to open their messages, and even then she had deleted the whole conversation where she essentially sent those nasty texts. It’s obvious because of the continuous gap within the conversation. My sister was clearly replying to her texts as she dissected different parts of it so it’s obvious Maya deleted majority of it, the only texts that she didn’t delete are the small texts where she’s like “I hope god is with you” or something that can be perceived nicely if you didn’t have context, and that sickened me even more unfortunately.

So i finally bought it up and she denied it over and over again. She then sobbed and said that I was stressing her out and I need to stop accusing her of vile acts. I wasn’t yelling, screaming or persisting. I just sat there knowing my marriage was genuinely over. I was hoping she’d own up to it, perhaps say something. but no, she didn’t. When i pulled up the screenshots, she called them fake but after an hour of this, she confessed it was here.

We talked for hours, every now and then she’d get up, go get water or something to eat, a napkin, etc. So everything she said are broken in pieces and I had to figure it out but the gist of it is that she wanted a husband like my ex brother in law. The next bit is all her words.

She grew up in a fairly strict family where traditional roles were held very highly and my wife disagreed with them. So she married me, someone who wasn’t strict, someone who doesn’t yell or act like her father, treat her like her mother, etc. Even though she wanted to change the cycle, she caught glimpse of my sisters ex husband; who was strict and valued traditional roles. She was jealous of my sister who had the best of both worlds. She had a brother who comforted her, allowed her to do whatever and let her embrace freedom but she also had a husband who protected her, laid rules out for her and ‘provided for her’.

The last part makes absolutely zero sense. i’ve been paying all the bills. The mortgage, the car payments, the utility bills, water and everything. Nothing is on her, ever.

She told me she hated that she worked and she wanted to be a house wife which later contradicted her because she also mentioned that she acted out because she missed being able to work. The pregnancy has been tough on her and she ended up quitting her job, her choice, and focused solely on making sure she has a safe delivery. She stated that me being so close to my mom, my sister, my cousins, pretty much any women, made her upset. And that she’d never keep connection with another man and it’s not fair that I get to.

I wanted to say this again, I’ve never had any problem with her keeping connection with anyone. I married her. She married me. We put rings and vows on each other. I’ve never controlled her and I’ve never yelled.

She bought up about how when she found out my sister got cheated on, she felt as if it were my sisters fault, because her husband was essentially a religious man ‘who can do no wrong’.  She admitted that her mom played a huge role in this as she’d call Maya and convince her that I was the type to cheat/leave because a man who likes you would get jealous to see you in certain clothes or around certain friends, even male family.

I don’t think that’s true, i’ve never felt that way. I wasn’t raised to feel that way. After a while we just stared at eachother and I asked her if she really wrote those texts. I just wanted her to say no, and this to all be some fabricated scheme, but nope. She wrote them. She cried and promised it’d never happen again, but how would it? She’s dead, i have no other sisters.

When I stood up for my sister again in the argument, she got frustrated because, in her words, my sister always had men swarming to protect her and that it wasn’t fair that she gets everything in life. She said that my sister having mental illnesses (depression, anxiety, etc) weren’t fair because she never went through anything, which is absolute bullshit. My sister has went through a lot, which I won’t air out here because my sister deserves respect and privacy so she can rest peacefully. She said all of these together were the reason she sent that text.

In the bits of it, turns out my wife also tried getting with my sisters husband, just slight flirty texts, which went ignored on his end. He answered, he just insulted her and basically said he wasn’t interested in her, like at all. He ended up telling my sister who had pretty much cut Maya off but never told me about it.

That was pretty much all I needed to hear. I let her know that I’ll be leaving the house to stay with my family. She can have her family over to stay with her and that I’d get my lawyers to contact hers in terms of anything legal. She didn’t take it well, and frankly that isn’t any of my problem anymore.

I’m applying to jobs currently and I scored a few interviews. My field is pretty unsaturated so I’m pretty hopeful. I’ll be making a big move soon. My chest feels a lot lighter after this conversation. I’ll see my family soon and perhaps share a beer with my dad and finally cry.

An introduction: I'm Jay, 31, male, from Texas though I've lived in the Midwest for a time (got to experience some of the worst summers and worst winters in my lifetime). I work as a veterinarian for humans - they get brought in, and I try my best to fix their issues and problems. It's been a pretty high stakes job; I average about 60-80 hours per week for about 50 weeks of the year. It won't always be this bad, but these hours are required during the initial years of the career (and it was even worse before the government stepped in to say 80 hours is the *maximum* we should have to do).

On top of that, I've got a case presentation to give on Friday, and then I've got a research presentation to give in about a week.

This is where you come in: I'm hoping that your wonderful, brief distractions will fill me with the motivation to keep on working through these duties. While my posture may suffer at this desk, my soul will rejoice every time I see that little red notification in the corner. Equally important, it'd be really nice to make a friend or two outside of work since I don't get too much time to be the social butterfly I used to be.

I find things begin best with a question a lot of times, so here's a few for you to pick from:

1. How would you describe your perfect meal?
2. How do you take your coffee? If you don't like coffee, what beverage can I grab for you?
3. Do you think some animals do know how to talk and communicate with us, they've just chosen not to? Maybe because they want to avoid paying taxes or something.

If you've made it this far, here's a little more about me:  
You already know what I do for work, but my dream job was to be an astronaut, I love aviation and space, I think I could find something cute about any animal, and overall I think laughing your way through most situations is an ideal strategy.

I look forward to hearing from ya.

Let’s be honest: these are the same people who queue up for the latest iPhone on EMI, who proudly flex foreign luxury brands on Instagram, who sip imported coffee in imported chains while conveniently ignoring Indian products sitting right next to them. You really think they’ll ditch Instagram and YouTube that easily, just because a Made in India alternative exists?

See, it’s not just about building the app. Tech talent we have. Infrastructure we can build. Servers, code, design all of it can be done. The REAL challenge is in breaking a deeply rooted mindset: the belief that anything foreign is automatically superior, cooler, more “status worthy.”

That’s the wall we’re up against. And unless this mindset changes, no matter how brilliant the Indian app is, people will still run back to what the West launches next. Because in their heads, validation comes stamped with a foreign logo.

So the real battle isn’t technical, it’s cultural. It’s psychological. It’s about unlearning this obsession with imported validation and realizing that our own creations deserve the same respect, the same pride, the same loyalty.

Chapter 1

“Mom, about what Dad said years ago… I’ve decided to go through with it. Tell him to arrange the marriage.”

I ended the call, and the music flooded back in. Audrey’s birthday party was still in full swing.

Audrey—the girl I once saved from bullies, who I thought was my best friend.

Jared, my boyfriend, and Jackson, my closest childhood friend, changed the moment Audrey entered our lives. Suddenly, she was their everything. They laughed with her, cared for her… and eventually, they told me they loved her. Right to my face.

Then came the dinner. Just the three of us. A final attempt to fix things—so I thought. But when Audrey called, crying about being robbed, they left me. Again.

It was raining. I wandered the streets, soaked and alone, until I was hit by a car. They never even bothered checking on me.

So I packed my bags. Booked a flight. Met my groom.

Then I sent Jared and Jackson one last message: My Wedding Invitation.

\--

“About what father said years ago…” I paused, my voice barely rising above the music thumping through the villa walls. “I’m now agreeing to get married. Please tell him to arrange all the prep work. No need for romance—make it just formal.”

There was a moment of stunned silence on the other end before my mother’s familiar voice broke through. “Are you sure about this? What about your boyfriend, Jared? Did you finally break up with him?”

“Not yet,” I replied, firm but tired. “Don’t tell anyone about this yet.” I swallowed the ache in my throat. “I’ll send the other list for the agreement and return home as soon as possible.”

Then I hung up. The phone slid from my hand and dropped onto the soft mattress beside me. That’s when the noise outside clawed its way back into my senses.

It was Audrey’s birthday. The adopted daughter of my parents. The girl I once thought of as my little sister. The same girl I’d defended from bullies back in high school, when the four of us—me, Audrey, and my childhood friends Jared and Jackson—were supposed to be a family.

Back then, I thought I was doing the right thing. That helping her would bring us closer. That we could all live in one house and laugh over dinner. I never imagined she’d twist everything.

Audrey was clever like that. She’d wormed her way into everything. She used to tag along with us—me, Jared, and Jackson. I didn’t mind. At first. But then it was like she started trying to replace me. Whispering things to Jared when I wasn’t looking. Making Jackson laugh in a way that used to be just mine. Still, I told myself not to overthink it.

But then I saw it. The kiss. It was supposed to be a quiet night. Just me and Jared who eventually became my boyfriend as we both confessed our love. Then, I caught him and Audrey kissing.

I let it go—for a while. But it happened again. And again.

Every time I asked, Jared brushed it off. “You’re just jealous,” he’d say. “She’s like a sister.”

Jackson said the same. “Don’t ruin everything because you’re being insecure, Maureen.”

But it wasn’t insecurity. It was betrayal.

And now, here I was—alone at her birthday party. Watching the three of them giggle and clink glasses like they were the main characters in some twisted romantic comedy. Jared had just taken a shot—and with a laugh, he pressed the empty glass to Audrey’s lips, his free hand grazing her body as if they were already lovers.

I couldn’t breathe. I got up and quietly slipped back into one of the guest rooms upstairs. But just as I was pulling the blanket over my head, the door creaked open.

“Maureen?” Audrey’s voice was laced with fake concern. “They’re looking for you downstairs. We’re about to do the fireworks.”

I stayed still. “I’m tired and sleepy. Just go.”

“Come on…” She stepped closer. “It’s my birthday. Are you really going to be like this?”

I turned to face her, my voice low. “Audrey, isn’t it enough that I was forced to be here?”

She frowned. “Do you really hate me now? Is it because you think I stole them from you? That was never my intention. Please… we used to be best friends—”

“Stop.” I held up my hand. “Just go enjoy your party.”

But she wouldn’t. She grabbed my wrist, tugging. “Let’s go. It’ll be fun. I’m happy when you’re with me—”

“Don’t touch me!” I tried to yank away, but her grip tightened.

In the struggle, we lost balance. We both fell backward—Audrey crashing into the small table beside the bed. The vase on top tipped and shattered, the shards slicing into our arms and shoulders.

Pain bloomed down my forearm, but before I could react, the door flew open.

My boyfriend Jared. He didn’t rush to me. No. He ran to her.

“Are you okay? Audrey—what happened?!” he asked, checking her wounds, brushing the glass from her skin.

“She pushed me,” Audrey whimpered. “I didn’t mean to—she just—”

“What the heck, Maureen?!” Jared turned to me with a snarl. “You’re ruining everything. Again.”

I stared at him, speechless. Blood dripping from my hand.

“She attacked me,” I said, shaking. “She pulled me. I told her to stop—”

But he wasn’t listening. Neither was Jackson, who had now joined them. “You’re always like this,” he snapped. “Jealous. Dramatic. Can’t stand not being the center of attention.”

Then I was told to apologize. Even with blood soaking through my sleeves, I was the one ruining her birthday.

Jackson grabbed me by the arm. “Come on. You’re coming downstairs. We’re celebrating. You’re not going to embarrass the family again.”

So I went. Bruised, bleeding, humiliated—I stood beneath the fireworks, watching them laugh and dance.

Just one last time, I thought. One last time, I’ll try. I joined the circle by the bonfire, fake smile painted on like war paint.

The music swelled. People cheered. I was swaying, barely holding it together when I felt the shove. Jared pushed me? How… why?

I stumbled straight into the bonfire’s edge. Pain exploded up my arm as flames kissed my skin.

I screamed.

Someone screamed with me—Audrey. She rushed to my side, panicked. “Oh, god! Maureen is hurt! We need to call an ambulance—she’s hurt—”

But Jared stepped in, shaking his head. “It’s nothing. Just a small burn. She’ll get by. It’s her punishment for hurting you a while ago.""

And Jackson? He didn’t even look at me.

No one helped.

I dragged myself away from the fire. Then I hailed a cab.

No one offered to take me to the hospital. No one cared that I was bleeding.

But that was fine… because this is the last time they’re going to hurt me again.

Chapter 2

“It’s a good thing you came in right away,” the nurse said as she gently cleaned the raw skin of my arm. “This is a second-degree burn, and you needed stitches too.”

I didn’t respond. Just nodded. The white ceiling above me blurred. I stayed at the hospital for two more days.

Not a call. Not a single message. No “Are you okay?” No “Sorry for what happened.”

Nothing. They didn’t even care enough to pretend.

On the second evening, I found myself aimlessly scrolling through my phone. Maybe some part of me still hoped they’d reached out. But all I found were photos.

Bright, glowing snapshots of Audrey in her brand-new red dress, smiling between Jared and Jackson. Champagne glasses raised. That same smirk on her lips that she always wore when she knew she had won.

“Thank you Jared and Jackson for the best birthday ever! I’ll treasure this forever! Look at our new friendship bracelets!!!”

I zoomed in. Three matching bracelets. And then Jared and Jackson no longer wore our friendship bracelets like before.

I turned off the screen and placed the phone face down on the side table. Just silence again. My heart pounded in that silence. But it didn’t hurt anymore. It was just… empty.

Two days later, I was back at the apartment. The same place we’d all moved into after college. It was supposed to be a home for a family, only that they had betrayed me.

I stepped inside the quiet living room and headed straight to my bedroom. I opened the closet and began to pack.

I reached for my shoes and then paused. There it was—the memory box. That dumb, stupid box I had once called my ""treasure chest.""

I sat on the floor, dragging it out, letting the dust coat my fingers. Inside were letters. Crumpled, faded ones written by Jared and Jackson from when we were kids. Stick drawings, silly poems, “get well soon” cards when I had the flu.

And a photo. The three of us—me, Jared, and Jackson—kneeling by a treehouse, dirt on our clothes, wide grins across our faces.

I remembered that day. It was the summer I got bit by a dog. Or almost did. I was always terrified of dogs, and the neighbor’s dog had gotten loose. I froze, too scared to move. Jared and Jackson had jumped in front of me like it was instinct. Jared even got a bite on his arm just to protect me.

After that, everything changed. They became my shadows. My protectors. And somewhere along the way, I had fallen in love with Jared, while Jackson treated me like a sister.

Until Audrey ruined everything.

I sat on the floor, gripping a friendship bracelet with my name on it. I was such a fool.

My parents had warned me when I begged them to adopt Audrey. “Are you sure about this, Maureen? Not everyone wants a sister the way you do. And what if she hurts you? You can’t just trust anyone that easy.”

I hadn’t listened. I believed love would be enough.

But now?

Now I knew.

She didn’t want to be my sister. She wanted to be me.

I packed up the rest of my things. Then, I carried the memory box outside. I set the box down and lit the match in the backyard.

The flames caught quickly. The letters curled, blackening. The bracelets twisted in the heat, their gold sheen turning dull and dead. The photos dissolved into ash.

“Maureen!”

I turned at the sound of Jared’s voice. He came running from inside, panic written all over his face.

“What are you doing?!” he shouted. “Are those… are those our albums?! The bracelets?!”

“Yes,” I said simply. “I’m burning all our memories.”

He tried to move closer, but I stepped in front of the fire, blocking him. “It’s over. All of it.”

Jackson arrived seconds later, looking just as stunned.

“Is this some kind of tantrum?” he asked, arms crossed. “You’re upset, we get it. But this is dramatic, even for you.”

“This isn’t a tantrum,” I said, my voice calm, steady. “This is the end.”

“You’re really going to let one bad night ruin years of friendship?” Jared asked. “Maureen, don’t do this. We can talk—”

I met their gaze before turning to Jared. “I don't want to ever be with the both of you again.""

I turned away and walked back inside the apartment, the smoke still curling behind me.

Chapter 3

I thought they’d leave me alone after I burned everything. But they didn’t.

Days passed, and slowly, Jared started acting like nothing had happened. He began sending flowers again. He texted like a sweet boyfriend, asked about my day, and even tried to kiss me once when we crossed paths outside the building. It was as if nothing had ever gone wrong.

Jackson followed suit, playing the big brother again—bringing coffee, joking about old times. Every time they said, “Sorry about what happened, let’s fix things,” it sounded more like they were apologizing for a stubbed toe than years of neglect and betrayal.

Then they surprised me with dinner.

“Our treat,” Jared said. “At our old spot.”

Part of me wanted to delete the message and never look back. But another part of me—the tired, devastated part—wondered if maybe, just maybe, we could end this all without bitterness. Without hating each other.

So I went. The restaurant hadn’t changed. Dim lighting, warm wooden booths, soft jazz playing overhead. It smelled like rosemary and nostalgia. I sat down, watching them laugh, trying to recapture something that had long since died. For a few moments, it almost felt okay.

Then Jared’s phone rang.

He glanced at it and froze. “It’s Audrey.”

He answered, frowning. “What? Slow down… You were robbed? What? Stabbed?! Where are you—”

In seconds, both he and Jackson were on their feet.

“She’s crying,” Jared explained breathlessly. “She was attacked. We’ve got to go.”

They didn’t say goodbye. They didn’t even look at me again.

They just ran. Ran like their world depended on her.

I sat there in silence, staring at the half-eaten food. The candle on the table flickered until it burned out completely.

I paid the bill myself.

When I stepped outside, the sky had opened up. Thunder cracked across the heavens as rain poured relentlessly. The streets were nearly empty—no taxis, no buses. The restaurant manager offered me an umbrella, but they were already closed. I couldn’t stay.

So I walked. Each step was heavy. My bandaged arms ached. My body screamed for rest. But the worst part?

The thunder. It echoed in my chest, triggering a deep fear I’d carried since childhood. I always froze during storms. The lightning, the cracks—it made me feel like the world was about to split in two.

I wrapped my coat tighter and kept going, the city turning into a blur of light and shadows.

Then—a sharp light. A horn.

A car.

I didn’t even have time to move.

Then: darkness.

When I woke up, everything felt… soft. Too soft. I was in a room I didn’t recognize. Clean, white walls. Dim lighting. My body hurt, but it was dull, distant. I blinked hard, turning toward the sound of someone shifting nearby.

“Jared…?” I whispered.

But it wasn’t him.

A man sat in the corner, tall, dressed in black, his eyes unreadable. He didn’t move until I tried to sit up.

“You’re awake,” he said. His voice was deep, steady. “Don’t move too much.”

“Who… are you?”

“Roscoe,” he said. “I found you after the accident. Took you to the hospital. You were unconscious.”

I wanted to ask more. But everything spun—and I blacked out again.

When I opened my eyes again, Roscoe was gone.

No note. No contact. Just… gone. There were no missed calls. No messages. No check-ins.

Except for my mother.

Mom: Call me when you’re on your way here now. Everything’s ready now. Come home.

I didn’t tell her what happened. I didn’t want her to worry.

The nurse told me I’d been lucky. The car had hit me from the side, but nothing was broken—still, I needed a few more days to heal.

So I stayed. Alone.

Until discharge.

Back at the apartment, I stepped inside just to grab the last of my things before I booked my flight home.

That’s when Jared appeared at the door.

“Oh, good. You’re back.” He smiled like nothing had happened. “So, listen… we had to sell your car. And some of your things too. Audrey needed emergency funds, and—”

“What?” I asked, stunned. “You sold my things?”

“Relax,” Jackson said, walking in. “We’ll pay you back. But Audrey’s been through a lot after the robbery. She needs someone to take care of her—can you cook for her? She’s not eating well.”

I blinked, stunned. “Are you serious?”

Jackson’s brows furrowed. “Where’ve you been anyway? Audrey said you went to some party after the dinner. Don’t you think that’s not a good behavior when Audrey was in danger? You shouldn’t have been here with us! I think you’re being selfish.”

I felt like I’d been punched. I laughed. It came out hollow, broken. “Right. A party.”

Then I threw the hospital discharge file straight at them.

“There. That’s where I was. The hospital. You left me in the rain. I walked home through a thunderstorm. I got hit by a car.”

“What…?” Jared asked, staring. “You were in the hospital?”

“I thought you were with friends…” Jackson mumbled, confused. “Audrey said—”

“Of course she did,” I snapped. “It’s always Audrey, isn’t it?”

Before they could say more, a high-pitched scream came from the hallway.

“Help! Jared, Jackson—it hurts! Please!”

Audrey. Of course.

Always Audrey.

I didn’t wait to hear their response. I turned, stepped over the threshold, and walked away.

Chapter 4

My entire body still ached. So instead of leaving as planned, I stayed in my room, letting the dull pain anchor me to the bed.

I didn’t cry. There were no tears left.

When I opened my eyes again, sunlight streamed through the curtains, warm against my skin. And right there, at the foot of my bed, stood Jared and Jackson.

“Good morning,” Jared said with a sheepish smile, holding a tray. “We brought you breakfast.”

Jackson placed the tray gently on my lap. Toast, scrambled eggs, some fruit, and a glass of orange juice. Bland and almost cold.

“Thought you could use something to start the day,” Jackson added, sitting at the edge of the bed.

I looked at them. They looked casual. Relaxed. Almost happy. Like the last few days hadn’t happened.

“Look,” Jared said, scratching the back of his neck. “We’re sorry. Audrey told us she saw an Instagram story of you at a party that night… and she was just hurt, you know? She got robbed and stabbed while thinking you were out dancing. She… she thought you were ignoring her on purpose.”

Jackson chimed in. “She really believed it. So… maybe you should apologize to her. Just to clear things up.”

I stared at them in disbelief, then scoffed.

“Maybe you should apologize to me.”

That made them blink.

Jared frowned. “Why would we? It’s not like we did anything wrong. You didn’t tell us what happened. If you had, we could’ve been there for you.”

I let out a bitter laugh. “Do I need to beg to be cared about now? I was gone for days. You didn’t even check.”

“Don’t say that,” Jackson said firmly. “Audrey got stabbed. She needs us.”

“And I didn’t?” My voice sharpened. “So if I’m not bleeding in front of you, I don’t deserve a second thought?”

Before either of them could respond, the door creaked open and in she came.

Audrey. She wore a soft, oversized sweater and limped slightly. Her face was pale, lips trembling as tears welled up in her eyes.

“Are you picking a fight with me now, Maureen?” she whispered, her voice shaking. “I’m sorry. Okay? I didn’t mean to get hurt. I didn’t mean for any of this to happen.”

I watched her carefully. Her trembling, her pout, the subtle gaslighting laced in every word. Like she was the one being attacked.

Again. The tears slipped down her cheeks.

“I just… I don’t want us to be enemies. We were sisters once… I wish we could go back.”

And just like that, the boys snapped.

“Stop making her cry, Maureen,” Jared snapped.

“Come on, Audrey,” Jackson said softly. “You shouldn’t be walking too much. Let’s get you back to bed.”

They turned to her with such care, such concern—it stung.

“I’ll feed you,” Jared said as he took her hand. “You need to eat.”

“Yeah,” Jackson added. “You need your strength. We’ll get your favorite seafood in the other room.”

Then they turned back to me.

“You eat what we made, Maureen,” Jared said. “You’ve been discharged. Stop being so picky.”

And with that, they led Audrey out, leaving me alone again.

I looked down at the plate in front of me. The eggs were rubbery. The toast, dry. The fruit was unripe.

Across the hall, I could hear them laughing.

Audrey’s voice rang out clear: “Mmm, I love crab legs! You remembered I hate toast, right? Seafood’s my favorite!”

Of course it was. They gave me scraps and fed her a feast.

I didn’t cry. Not this time. I was just done.

My phone buzzed.

It was a message from Mom: Venue options are in. Also attached are the dresses. Let me know what you like, darling.

I tapped the call icon.

“Mom,” I said, my voice steady.

“Maureen! Did you get the pictures? What do you think of the flower arrangements?” she asked excitedly. “And also the dresses?”

“I like everything. It was actually hard to choose,” I replied. “I’ll finalize it today. But I think I like the vintage one.”

“Great! We’ll prepare it for you. How long until you come back? Your groom’s waiting, you know. He’s very eager.”

“Just a few more days. Something happened, but I’ll be there. I’m looking forward to wearing those dresses… to the wedding.”

Mom let out a soft laugh. “That’s my girl. We’ll wait for you.”

I hung up. I stared at the tray, untouched. Then I felt it—the silence shift.

I looked up. Jared and Jackson stood in the doorway. I hadn’t even heard them come back.

Their eyes locked on me, their faces unreadable.

Jackson’s voice came first. “Dress to the wedding?”

Then Jared stepped forward, his brows pulling into a frown. “Wedding? What wedding?”

And the sender's name was Vanessa, my friend.

I froze, her breath catching in her throat.

They...cheated?

When I was about to enter my password, I found that it had been changed.

What？ He...

When he turned around and faced me, I’d seen the lipstick on his jaw, and then on closer inspection on his neck, I’d felt like my heart had been torn from my chest.

He was still sound asleep, lightly snoring.

I leaned in closer to hear him mumbling, ""You really bang me so well, Vanessa.‘’

My world stops.

I attempt to close my eyes and go to sleep, but the scent of perfume on his wallet brings tears to my eyes.



————————



The text arrived at 2:17 AM on a Tuesday, six days before Tasha Evans would become Tasha Rifton. Not that she saw it while sleeping next to her fiancé, his back turned to her, the curve of his spine a parenthesis holding secrets she hadn't yet decoded. The message wasn't even meant for her. But phones ding and partners stir, and sometimes the universe conspires to show you exactly what you need to see, exactly when you're strong enough to see it.

By the time Tasha scrolled through the thread the next morning, it was after Liam abandoned his phone on the bathroom counter while he showered, a notification light blinking like a warning. She felt something peculiar settle into her bones. Not shock. Not even heartbreak. Just a cold, crystalline clarity that whispered: You always knew. And she had. The late meetings. The password changes. The way Vanessa's name had started peppering his stories, then suddenly stopped altogether. Standing in their kitchen, scrolling through a year's worth of messages, Tasha watched the Pinterest board version of her future dissolve in real time.

Can't wait to peck you again. Last night was...

She didn't finish reading. Didn't need to. The preview was damning enough, the sender's name was Vanessa, with the sunshine emoji, because of course—even more so. Tasha placed the phone back exactly where she'd found it, screen down, notification still blinking. She moved to the kitchen and poured coffee into her mug, the one Liam had given her last Christmas with ""Future Mrs. Rifton"" printed in swirling gold script.

Mechanically, she opened her laptop. The wedding checklist glowed on the screen: 142 confirmed guests. $32,000 in non-refundable deposits. A custom neon sign that read ""The Riftons"" waiting to be picked up tomorrow. The numbers swam before her eyes as the shower stopped running, and she heard Liam humming, actually humming, as he toweled off.

""Morning, beautiful."" He appeared in the doorway, water droplets still clinging to his collar bone, smile as bright as if he hadn't been sexting her so-called friend at 2 AM. He pecked the top of her head and she felt her body stiffen. ""Everything okay?""

""Just wedding jitters,"" she lied smoothly, surprising herself. The old Tasha would have crumbled instantly, confronted him tear-streaked and desperate. But something had shifted when she'd read that text. Like a fever breaking, leaving her strangely lucid. ""Picking up the place cards today.""

""You've got this all under control."" His hand brushed her shoulder as he reached for his own coffee mug—""Mr. Right,"" to her ""Mrs. Always Right."" A matching set. How very on-brand for their Instagram-perfect relationship. ""That's what I love about you. Always so... composed.""

No, she thought. You love that I don't ask questions. That I smile for the photos and make your mother think you're God's gift. That I've never once made you uncomfortable.

""Riley's coming by later to help with the welcome bags,"" she said instead.

Liam's phone buzzed again on the counter. He glanced at it, then at her, then casually flipped it over. ""Great. I've got that listing appointment in Parkview, then drinks with the guys to finalize bachelor party stuff."" He pecked her again, this time on the lips, and she tasted his lie like copper. ""Don't wait up.""

When the front door closed behind him, Tasha remained frozen at the kitchen island. One year of planning. Three years of dating. Five years of friendship before that. All of it suddenly suspect, like currency she'd thought was real but now felt textured all wrong beneath her fingertips.

She opened Instagram and there it was, Vanessa's perfect life in filtered squares. The yoga poses on white sand beaches, the green smoothies, the inspirational quotes about authenticity. And there, twelve weeks back: Vanessa at a rooftop bar downtown, cocktail raised to the setting sun. Tasha had taken that photo. What she hadn't noticed then, but saw with laser focus now, was Liam's watch on the table beside Vanessa's purse. A watch Tasha had given him, inscribed with their anniversary date.

Her phone buzzed.

Riley: On my way with rosé and ribbon. Wedding crunch time, baby!

Tasha stared at the message, her throat tight. Riley, her best friend since college. Riley, who would burn the world down for her. Riley, who had never liked Liam all that much anyway.

Tasha: Can you come alone? Something's happened.

The response was immediate.

Riley: I'm already in the car. 10 minutes. Do I need to bring bail money?

Despite everything, Tasha almost smiled. She texted back a simple No and then, after a pause, added: Not yet, anyway.

She wandered into their bedroom, suddenly seeing it all with new eyes. The framed engagement photos. The wedding countdown calendar on her nightstand. The garment bag containing her dress, hanging like a ghost against the closet door. She unzipped it slowly, revealing handcrafted lace and delicate beading with thousands of tiny details she'd obsessed over. The perfect dress for the perfect day for the perfect couple.

What a crock of it.

.......

She heard a key in the front door—Riley had had one since they'd moved in—followed by the clatter of bags being dropped and heels clicking rapidly across hardwood.

""Tash?"" Riley appeared in the doorway, dark curls wild around her face, eyes wide with concern. She was still in her nurse's scrubs, clearly having come straight from the overnight shift. ""What's wrong? Is it your mom? The venue?""

""Liam's cheating on me."" The words felt strange on her tongue. Clinical, almost. Like a diagnosis. ""With Vanessa.""

Riley's expression cycled through disbelief, rage, and finally, a grim lack of surprise that felt like another betrayal. ""You're sure?""

Tasha nodded. ""Texts. Photos. The whole rom-coms nightmare.""

""That jerk."" Riley dropped onto the bed beside her. ""The audacity. His days are numbered. I'll make it look like an accident. I'm a medical professional. I know how.""

That did make Tasha smile, just slightly. ""You've never liked him.""

Riley took her hand, squeezed it hard. ""I liked how happy you thought you were with him. Different thing."" She looked Tasha straight in the eyes. ""What do you need?""

Such a simple question. So impossible to answer. Tasha looked around the room, at the life she'd constructed. The future she'd planned, all the way down to the monogrammed cocktail napkins and custom Spotify playlist for their first dance.

""I need..."" She faltered, then something hardened in her chest. ""I need to think. Can we just... sit here for a minute? Before everything falls apart?""

Riley nodded and leaned back against the headboard, still holding Tasha's hand. They sat in silence, two best friends at the edge of a cliff, looking down at the ruins of what was supposed to be. Outside, summer sunlight filtered through the curtains Tasha had carefully selected to match the bedroom's ""calming coastal"" aesthetic. In six days, 142 people would be dressed in their finest, waiting for her to walk down the aisle toward a man who couldn't even keep his lies straight.

""You know what pisses me off the most?"" Tasha said finally, her voice steady. ""It's not even the cheating. It's that he's so gotdamn lazy about it. Like I'm not worth the effort of a decent cover story.""

""Men like Liam don't think the rules apply to them,"" Riley said, her voice low. ""They think they're entitled to everything; the perfect fiancée at home, plus the side piece for excitement. Having their wedding cake and eating it too.""

""The bachelor-bachelorette weekend is this Saturday,"" Tasha said, almost to herself. The state fair, Liam's favorite annual tradition. They'd had their third date there, years ago. He'd won her a stuffed bear at the ring toss, pecked her on the Ferris wheel. Now they were supposed to celebrate with their wedding party, including Vanessa, who wasn't a bridesmaid but had wormed her way into the friend group years ago with her effortless charm and Instagram-ready smile.

""Cancel it,"" Riley said immediately. ""Cancel everything. I'll help you. We'll send out mass texts, emails, whatever. Your brother can tell your side of the family. Screw Liam and his deposit money.""

But Tasha was suddenly seeing it all—the tent they'd reserved at the fairgrounds, the champagne toast scheduled for sunset, the look on Liam's face when they'd booked it all. ""It's where it all began,"" he'd said, as if their relationship was some epic love story and not, as she now knew, a convenient arrangement he'd never fully committed to.

""No,"" she said slowly, an idea taking shape. ""No, I don't want to cancel.""

Riley looked confused. ""You can't possibly still want to⁠—""

""The fair. The toast. All of it."" Tasha turned to Riley, something new flickering in her eyes. ""I want to go through with it.""

""Tasha, honey..."" Riley's voice was gentle, the kind used for patients in denial. ""I know you've put a lot into this wedding, but⁠—""

""Not the wedding,"" Tasha interrupted, her heart suddenly racing with clarity. ""Just the fair. The party. One last gathering before I blow it all up.""

We went on a day trip to Mexico (we’re from a semi-border city) to visit family and while we were there I got a large bag of my favorite chips. I also had brought an unopened pop tart with me from home. We got food while on the drive back and when I finished eating I put my bag of chips and pop tart into the paper bag my food came in so it would all be easier to carry inside later. When we got home late that night my hands were full entering the house, my husband asked where the keys were and asked if they were in my purse, I said no but he patted his empty pockets and asked me to check. I told him my hands were full and he could look. The bag was in front of me hanging by my belt already unzipped and only had my phone, wallet and a closed small makeup bag in it. Yet he was very exaggerated in try to “look through” it by yanking on it to the point that he knocked my stuff out of my hands. He began to pick some things up while I glanced in my purse and stated that I don’t have the keys. He had left them in the car, while he got them I picked up what was left on the ground. Either way one of the items he picked up and brought in the house was the paper bag of food items. The next day I wanted to eat the pop tart so when I didn’t see it in the cabinet nor the chips I asked where the paper bag was and he replied “I threw it away, you said it was trash.” I have no recollection of saying this or him asking me but either way he said nothing else and proceeded to continue playing video games. So I didn’t respond back, I just went and checked the trash and underneath wet coffee grounds, napkins and other random stuff I could see a little bit of the paper bag so I pulled on it but it ripped from being wet. I was able to see the bag of chips and fished them out before transferring the inside contents to a plastic bag but I never found (didn’t fish deeper for) the pop tart. Either way, I didn’t really care, I just thought it was a bit unkind that he couldn’t have cared less when we figured out my unopened food had been thrown away. Then, to my surprise, when I brought out the chips later to have a few, he said “oh yeah, bring those over here” and when I said “no, you didn’t care that they were thrown out, nor did you help get them out of the trash.” He went on to let me know that it was normal for him to not care that he threw them out because the bag was trash. It was fast food I picked up on the way home, and in the car he asked if I ate all my food and I said yes, so it was trash. (I feel like this lowkey confirms that he never asked if it was trash but I digress.) Again, I said that’s fine, it’s okay that it got thrown out, I can understand how it happened, I just didn’t like that when we realized my food had been thrown out, you didn’t care. The conversation didn’t go on much further but he let me know that I was wrong for not sharing. So am I, am I being an asshole? Had I not went and looked through the trash they’d still be there and wouldn’t be available to be eaten.",2,1756790762.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

This happened 2 years ago but I’m really struggling with something from high school. I had a teacher and coach who gave me a lot of attention. I was 17 and he was 42. At the time, I had a huge crush on him which grew into an obsession. Everyone knew and he said when I later told him that he thought I was just doing me things but it was obvious. He would constantly tease me, laugh a lot around me, and turn red/flustered. Make extra efforts to talk to me, check in on me, or give me attention in ways that felt different from how he treated other students for example he would do my homework for me or put my grade in and would let only me call him by his first name. He told me he doesn’t let anyone else do so. He would let things get a little too personal (like long conversations, inside jokes, pinky promises, remembering things I told him, talking about his girlfriend, and hugging me) I would always go into his classroom for lunch or when I didn’t have his class that semester. He would give me special treatment and wouldn’t towards other students. It was just weird I guess. Other girls would try to rat me out saying I was talking about him in my other classes and he would say I don’t care she’s super cool. After I graduated we kept in contact and he agreed to get coffee with me and told me to let him know when I was in town so we could do it again. He pulled me in really closely and held me there for a while as he said this. It just felt a little uncomfortable even though I had feelings for him. I was in love with him. I thought it was special and real but now I feel confused and broken. My friends keep saying he groomed me or manipulated me but I spiraled so much that I texted him and confessed everything and he told me recently that he “never felt that way” and was just trying to be supportive. I asked other students (my friends) who were in his class and some say the way he would look at me was sickening or they would be asking him about homework and he was casually bring me up. The thing is I still love him and I hate admitting that but it feels like he gave me something no one else has. At the same time, I feel sick about it, like I was tricked into believing it was love. It’s been two years but he’s made everything so fucking nostalgic and I keep completely ruining myself for him. He makes pain and suffering look like love and I crave him every minute of my life. I just need to ask based on what I described if this sounds like grooming or just inappropriate behavior? I feel like I can’t trust my own perspective and other people I know and I really need to hear from people who’ve been through similar things.

Thanks for reading. ❤️

1n6b3se,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1n6b3se/i_think_noone_should_stay_i_think_staying_with_an/,"I think noone should stay. I think staying with an alcoholic is always the wrong choice. And I think that Alanon supports this - and I think its like a cult. and I think you all need to focus on a Psychologist , not relying on Al-Anon.","im 32. My parents abused me as a child. My mom is 30 years sober- and shes AA Alanon obsessed. Shes a pillar in the community - she does speaker meetings with thousands of people. She literally hosts a pot lck once a month with her friends/ sponsers/ and her grand sponseees etc. people love her 

They dont realize or see her on the inside She got sober right before she had me. I spent my childhood in daycare at AA meetings - thy are like home to me. Cigarettes and coffee reminds me of my childhood. I would go see her take cakes and same with my uncle who is a sober addict. I think that was a mistake. Listening to these horrific gnarly stories of sobriety in speaker meetings was inappropriate. My mother used to say my disease is a bodybuilder in my mind getting stronger every day ready to come out. She also told me if it wasnt for AA and sobriety I wouldnt have a mom. Who the fuck says that to a 8 year old?

Meanwhile my father was physically and verbally and emotionally abusing me and my brother,  and being perverted with me. like my whole childhood and teen years. and my mother was emotionally neglecting me - hot and cold - giving me silent treatement for days. Id borrow her brush and forget to bring it back as a 10 year old. I would lose my hairbrushes and borrow hers and I forgot to bring it back. Instead of putting hre brush in a different spot, giving me multiple brushes, or bedazzling a brush or some shit with me. She would scold me and psycho analyze me and make it out how me forgetting to bring her brush back means that I don't respect her or her things as a person, that I think this and that etc etc make it about my character. She was physically violent, she is emotionally immature. Very. I never connected with her. I would try. She would say to me ""Im your mother not your friend"" And it made me sad because my friends were so close to their moms and would say stuff like my mom is my best friend and they were. She also would stand by and let my father physically abuse my brother and say ""Its the relationship with your father - Its between the both of you"" while hes abusing a 12 year old. My dad drank coors light every night, only a tall can or one or two beers. My mom would tell me hes an alcoholic. I didnt really think so I had never seen him drunk ever. But now I see that he probably did have a drinking issue.  They constantly fought, they both were nasty.  my mom emotionally neglected me, gaslit me, and invalidated my feelings constantly. She would literally give me silent treatment for days as a child. How do you give silent treatment to a child? Thats abuse. And for days? I rememebr crying begging her to talk to me as an 8 year old. 

This woman went to two AA meetings a week and and also Alanon. She was heavily involved. Tell me yall. If Alanon Works so great - why is it this woman kept up her dysfunctional abusive family her whole life? 

My mom started AA and Alanon way in the beginning. Literally my entire life if I was struggling mentally her response was ""you need to go to alanon"" and it would infuriate me because im like Ive never seen you drink? Okay, I get the ""achoholic family system"" and ""codependency"" absolutely yes that is apart of our family system. Support groups are important but nothing can replace mental health care from a triained professional like  a Psychologist. 

Meanwhile I never slept, I was sad all the time and wanted to kill myself as a child. Yet her solutions was Alanon. No bitch I needed a therapist. But instead she consantly tried to get me go to Alateen. 

Im 32 now. I had to go no contact with my parents this last year. My dad no question. But I really tried to make it work with my mom. I lived with them for 8 months two years ago. My mom still is deeply toxic and sick in the head. its wild to me. She is so tightly wound and she verbally abuses me, emotionally abuses me. And even Physically. She does this thing where her eyes narrow and she looks fucked up. And she gets all in my face nose to nose like when guys are about to fight eachother. Last year she did that and backed me into a wall twice as I was saying ""move your body. Move your body. If your goign to hit me ihit me, get out of my face."" And she wouldnt. Shes fucking insane 

So I am also here because suprise suprise I am newly single and he was an alcoholic who got worse. Truly my first love, my soul mate and best friend. But he couldnt stop. I logically knew what was happening but I had faith in him. I went to Alanon once. And there were people talking about living with their alchohlic adn how their lives are so much better because they learned how they were in the wrong and how their behavior contributed and how they can live in peace now because they learned to manage their codepndency. This woman had kids. No yall. The answer is leave! You may love this person but staying with them even if you arent enabling isnt helping anyone. Another woman shared about how her husband is so mean to her and wont stop adn she doesnt know what to do. I get it you arent supposed to tell people what to do  . but come on! We are human, the answer should have been the goup saying linda. You gotta get out of there You need to leave him. We got you. 

Life is a double edged sword , a grey area . I know support groups are so helpful and also there is truth to codependency, enabling etc. However why not a support group where you arent ""working steps"" or having the spiritual aspect which is rooted in christianity and patriarchy and also drives people away? I would go to mental health support groups and thats all it is. We need that. But Alanon and AA is toxic. Sure I am sure it has helped so many. But I firsthand have seen how it also has fueled egos and also made people think they are getting help when they need professional help 

My mother talks to thousands of people. She sponsers women. She shouldnt be sponsering vulnerable 21 year old addicts and alchohlics who are trying to get sober. Sure support group , sponser them. But she is the last person to be giving advice! How is it this woman has done the program for 30 years and she still is the most toxic person and terrible to me, and clearly hasnt made made any real healing advances at all? Yes I think advice here telling people not to enable etc is important. Im not saying its all bad. But I posted for help about my ex here montsh and months ago. I mentioned how I dont want to go to alanon bc of x yz . Noone offered me any advice and support. It was all cult like sounding comments of ""Oh youll end up here when you are desperate enough"" Thats ego. AA NA and Alanon are full of ego.

 Its in your soul people. Your main answers are in your soul and intuition.

Im not an alchoholic. I smoke weed sometimes and drink occasionally. Yet my mother has literally shamed me and given me shit about both my whole entire life. My uncle my mom grandma all gave me so much shit for smoking weed. The narrative of oh it covers up your feelings, it makes you not motivated. Thats not true at all. I smoke occasionally and it helps me sort through my mind, it puts things in new persepective. Its an herb, and its from the earth, and herbs and plants all are natural liek our bodies and our medicine. The black and white thinking and labeling serves noone help.

Also I have seen firsthand my mother and people in AA who think its the only way. Dry drunk yeah I experienced that with people who have gone sober and then started drinking again. But Ive known people who went sober without AA and just therapy. Or their own inner work. 

Im posting this because the amount of posts on here and also on facebook from people talking about their abusive husbadns and alchohlics and how they use the logic in alanon like ""Oh hes drinking so I am leaving the house!"" Or "" He says that before we go out he wants to have a beer so I am not going.""

No. Break up with him. Leave him. Move on, Why is anyone entertaining this? This is so sad. Alanon gives abused women reasons to stay with toxic and sick addicted people . It gives them validation and tools to do it. Dont fucking do it. Life is to damn short . Find a man who has no addictions and has more peace and yeah maybe you can both get a glass of wine at that italian restaurant and it doesnt have to bea  big fucking ordeal.

I didnt need Alanon. I needed mental health care. And so did my mother, If she devoted herself to seeing a Psychologist with a Phd MD and educating herself about the science of metnal health and pscyhology and family systems from actual professionals progress could have been made. 

  
This is a cult. Why is there a support group saying christian prayers in 2025 and yet it is considered the go to groups fro people who love addicts? 

we need NAMI and DBSA Groups for loved ones of alchohlics that isnt this bullshit

Hey lets take a guy who was in prison most of his adult life and in gangs (my uncle) and addicted to meth, get him sober for 20 years adn then put him charge of the metnal health care of vulnerable addicts 

Im out yall. I left my ex. I am dating around and meeting good men with less drama. I am not going to be down the road in 10 years still contemplating leaving. It feels so complex and hard. Dont take the path of least resistance. Leave him, go , put boundaries , Get support but this is not a holy grail. Find a professional. Im out yall",7,1756790595.0,AlAnon,7,0.89,False

My best friend was getting married on Valentine’s Day and asked my boyfriend and me to be bridesmaid and groomsman.

Darian agreed on the spot,but when we got back,he looked troubled as he packed his luggage.“I have to go on a business trip,I really can’t attend the [wedding.Help](http://wedding.Help) me turn it down.”

I told him to focus on his own matters first,but unexpectedly,I came across his adoptive sister’s Instagram.

\[I am petty,I am willful,I won’t allow my brother to wear a wedding dress or suit with another woman,not even bridesmaid or groomsman outfits!\]

That’s when I realized that their so-called sibling relationship had already crossed the line…

——

I sat on the bed holding my phone,stunned for a long time,until Darian called me from the doorway.

“Honey,have you seen my white short-sleeved shirt?”

I lifted my head blankly,meeting the face I had loved for eight years.

Numbly,I stood up,pulled a short-sleeved shirt from the wardrobe and handed it to him.

Darian’s expression suddenly changed.“This one won’t do.”

“Why not?”

This was our only matching couple’s T-shirt.A year ago,I had pestered him endlessly before he finally agreed to wear it.

When we ran into Selene while shopping,I greeted her,only to have her throw an entire cup of milk tea all over me.

And what did Darian do back then?

He left me standing there covered in stains,while he gently coaxed that red-eyed little girl for over half an hour.

Then he rushed into a store to buy a new T-shirt to change into.

We had a huge fight over it,but in the end,I still couldn’t let him go and accepted his apology.

“This one’s so old,it’s long past wearing.”

He took it and casually tossed it into the trash bin.

Somehow,I felt that our eight years of love,from campus days to wedding vows,had become just like that shirt—no longer so precious.

Seeing my unhappiness,Darian pulled me into his arms.“I can’t be with you on Valentine's Day,but I’ll be passing through Paris this [time.Do](http://time.Do) you want a bag,or clothes…”

His tone was tender and one hand slowly slipped under my nightdress,guiding me toward the bed.

My mind was in turmoil.I shoved him away and said coldly,“Darian,let’s break up.”

Meeting my distant gaze,he pinched my earlobe nonchalantly.“Sulky girl,just because I can’t spend Valentine's Day with you,you want to break up?Then from now on I’ll make Valentine's Day a company holiday.I won’t go anywhere,I’ll spend it entirely with you,okay?”

Tears welled up in my eyes.

All these years,apart from his sister’s untouchable territory,he truly did grant my every wish.

When I said I liked roses,he flew in a whole plane of blue enchantresses from Kenya.When I said I liked water sports,even though he was afraid of water,he learned surfing and diving with me.

His love had always been vast and overwhelming,wrapping me up inside it,making everyone envious.

In that moment,a glimmer of hope stirred within me and I found myself wanting to ask him directly,“Darian,what’s really going on between you and your sister…?”

The phone rang.He glanced at the caller ID and immediately stood up.

I lay on the bed,my nightdress half-slipped to my chest,feeling as humiliated as the day I was splashed with milk tea.

After hanging up,Darian’s expression was cheerful as he dropped a kiss on my forehead.“Something came up at the company.I’ll come back tonight to spoil my princess.”

He left in a hurry,forgetting that his computer was still at home,its notification sound chiming nonstop.

The wallpaper was a photo of us together.The password was my birthday—everything still looked like he loved me.

I tapped into WhatsApp and it happened to open right to the chat with\[Princess Selene\].

\[Darian,this time when we go to the Maldives,I’m going to wear one of those three-piece bikinis.I’ll definitely be able to attract lots of abs-handsome guys by then.\]

Chapter 2

\[No.\]

\[Hmph,you’re not my boyfriend,I don’t want you telling me what to do.\]

\[I’m your brother.If you keep fooling around,I won’t take you abroad for Valentine’s Day.\]

\[Hehe,I know you’re just worried about me since I just broke up,but it’s also really wrong of you to wear groomsman and bridesmaid outfits with Ruby without my permission.Since you’re spending Valentine’s Day with me,I’ll wear it just for you.\]

Darian stayed silent for a long time before finally replying:

\[This is the last time.Ruby and I are getting married soon,from now on I’ll have to be with her.\]

What I once thought was perfect love dissolved into bubbles,slipping from the corners of my eyes and falling onto my slightly rounded belly.

I put away the pregnancy test with its two red lines and called my best friend Azura.

“Come out,drink with me.”

The bar’s laser lights painted everyone’s faces in dazzling colors.

Dressed in a red camisole,I squeezed into the writhing dance floor,swaying with different men.

Azura touched my forehead.

“Babe,what’s going on with you?Not keeping yourself for your Darian anymore?”

It suddenly hit me—Darian didn’t like places like this,so I hadn’t been here in a long time.

My throat tightened.I took a deep breath to keep the tears from falling.

“Azura,the one Darian loves isn’t me…”

A blast of music suddenly erupted and Azura excitedly pointed toward the stage.

“I knew it,you couldn’t hide it after dancing with that guy just now.”

Seeing that familiar figure,a sharp ache swelled in my chest.

Why was he here?Did he already know I had seen those chat records?Did he come to win me back?

The music stopped right then and my eyes met his across the room.

In his gaze flashed that familiar possessiveness—just like at our graduation party,when he accepted my confession.

My heart tightened sharply.

Darian set down the tea in his hand and walked toward me.

“Honey,you’re being naughty today…”

Before he could finish,his eyes swept past me,his brows furrowing tightly.

He strode straight to a girl in a white dress,drinking alone in frustration.

“Selene,come home with me.”Selene froze,her eyes reddening.

“Aren’t you about to get married?Didn’t you say you wouldn’t care about me anymore?Why are you pretending now?”

Darian’s knuckles whitened as he reached out to grab her.

“Who said I wouldn’t care about you?You’re my sister.”

But Selene shoved him away,tears streaming down her cheeks.

“I don’t want that!If this is the last time you’ll be with me,then I’d rather not go at all!”

A flicker of pain crossed Darian’s eyes,his lips moving slightly.

“Selene,I will have to get married someday and you will also—”

“I don’t want to hear it!”Selene screamed,covering her ears,a vicious gleam flashing in her eyes.“Would you only belong to me if she were dead?”

Before I could react,Selene swung an empty bottle straight at my head,her expression frenzied.

The shattering of glass exploded in my ears and warm liquid trickled down my forehead.

I staggered back two steps,only for a second bottle to smash against my head.“For stealing my brother,go to die!”

\*\*\*

When I woke up,I was lying in a hospital bed.

As I moved my hand,the IV needle tugged painfully;the nurse was changing the drip.

“Where’s the person who brought me here?”

I thought it was time for Darian and me to have a talk.

“You mean that girl?She stayed with you all night.She just left because she had something at the company today.”

I [froze.So](http://froze.So) the one who brought me here wasn’t Darian after all.

My phone buzzed.I picked it up—Selene had updated her Tiktok again.

\[It was just a little cut on my finger from the glass and my brother was worried sick.\]

Chapter 3

In the video,the man was half-squatting,carefully wrapping a band-aid around her finger.

Selene pouted coyly.“Darian,it hurts so much.”

The man froze,lowered his head with restraint and kissed that finger,his voice hoarse.

“Does it still hurt?”

It felt as if my own wound had been torn open again,doused with alcohol,the pain suffocating me.

I took a deep breath and dialed 110.“Hello,I want to report a crime.”

But what I ended up facing wasn’t the police—it was Darian,storming in with furious questions.

His eyes held a coldness I had never seen before.

“You called the police?Selene is just a childish girl—was this really necessary?”

Childish girl?My heart filled with disappointment.

“What kind of child would leave me needing more than thirty stitches?”

After my injury,Darian showed no concern for me,only blaming me for calling the police on his sister.

“Ruby,this is a family matter.There was no need to call the police.I’ve already punished her—confined her to the house for a day.”

I froze,then couldn’t help but laugh out loud,laughing until the wound ached.

“Darian,you call that punishment?Even if she beat me to death,would you still take her side like this?”

His gaze darkened.

“With me protecting you,how could I ever let you…”

His tone softened as he reached up to wipe the tears from my face,slipping a document into my hand at the same time.

“The police case has already been [withdrawn.Be](http://withdrawn.Be) good,just sign this and in a few days,I’ll have her apologize to you in person.”

Seeing the large characters“Letter of Forgiveness”on the page before me,my heart felt plunged into an icy pit in the middle of winter.

When I lifted my eyes again,there was only coldness in them.

“I’ll sign it,but you have to promise me one condition.”

Darian,holding the signed letter,stopped suddenly as he was about to walk out the door.

“Ruby,if you had a younger sister,you would understand me.You’re both equally important to me.”

I curved my lips in a faint smile.I didn’t have a younger sister—but I did have an older brother.

And I would never put him and my sister-in-law on opposite ends of a scale,forcing him to choose.

Thinking of that,I called my brother.“Willy,I don’t want to get married anymore.I want to go to Switzerland to see you.”

He immediately replied in a warm voice.“Alright,then don’t marry.I’ll book the ticket for you.”

The flight happened to be right after Azura’s wedding.

During those days in the hospital,Darian came diligently,appearing at the same time every day.

He brought light porridge,changed my dressings and when I woke up in pain during the night,he would silently hold my hand.

But inside,I felt no joy—only desolation.

Loving someone for eight years,yet letting go took just a single moment.

“Ruby,this is a cake Selene made to apologize to you.”

I glanced at it and my heart slowly sank.“Darian,did you forget?I’m allergic to mango.”

He clearly knew I had nearly lost my life once from just a spoonful of mango pudding.A flicker of something crossed his face,but still he insisted,holding the cake toward me.“The little girl worked hard to make [it.How](http://it.How) about you just eat a bite of the plain cake base?”

As he brought the spoon closer,I slapped it to the ground.“Was it not enough for you siblings to harm me once—you want a second time?”

His expression darkened at the sight of the cake on the floor.“How can you say that?Selene didn’t know—”

“She didn’t know,but what about you?”

Because of my sudden movement,the gauze on my head tore,blood seeping through.

Darian’s brows furrowed,his voice low.“I’ll get the doctor.”

But before he could step out of the ward,a phone call came through—a girl’s sobbing voice on the other end.

Chapter 4

Panic flashed in his usually calm eyes.“Wait for me,I’ll be right back.”

After he left,my vision went [dark.It](http://dark.It) wasn’t until the rounds nurse found me that she gently lifted me back onto the bed.

Staring hopelessly at the incandescent lamp overhead,I bit down on my lip.“Please,help me book an miscarriage surgery.”

Five years ago,I had already aborted one child for [him.At](http://him.At) that time,he said he wasn’t ready for marriage.

But thinking back now—that just happened to be when Selene was preparing for her college entrance exams.

Maybe even then,it was another compromise he made for his sister’s twisted possessiveness—at my expense.

After signing the consent papers,my phone chimed.Selene had just updated her social media.

\[With just a little trick,I managed to fool my brother into coming with me to celebrate Valentine's Day early…\]

The photo was of two hands interlocked,the background an airport.

On Darian’s hand was the very ring I had bought for him.

Just because of a single lie from her,he abandoned me—sick and in pain—to fly abroad with her.

When their plane took off,I was lying on the operating table.

When they landed on the beach,I was being wheeled out of surgery.

By the time Azura arrived,her makeup was streaked with tears.

“Why didn’t you say anything and went through the miscarriage alone?I’ll call that cheap man Darian right now.”

I weakly raised my hand,forcing a faint smile.“Azura,it’s over between us.”

Darian,I didn’t want you anymore.

Because of my injuries and the miscarriage,I stayed in the hospital for quite some time.

On the day of my discharge,I hadn’t expected him to show up to pick me up.Dressed in a black trench coat,he looked travel-worn and weary.

“I cut my business trip short,Ruby.I’ll spend Valentine's Day with you,don’t be mad anymore.”

He spoke on his own for a long time—explanations,apologies—until finally his gaze fixed on my face.

“Why do you look so pale?Let me take you home.”

He scooped me up into his [arms.My](http://arms.my/) palm landed hard across his face,yet he didn’t dodge.

“Ruby,I won’t leave you alone again.Let’s get married.”

I suddenly felt like laughing.

I had waited eight years—yet it was only now,after I had given up,that he finally said he wanted to marry me.

Selene was sitting in the passenger seat,still in her vacation sundress,not even having had time to change.

When she saw me get in,she handed me a coconut.“Ruby,it was my fault before.I’m here to apologize.”

Darian leaned over to fasten my seatbelt for me,then said in an indifferent tone,“Selene will be staying at our place for a few days.”

I ignored them both,calmly gazing out the window at the scenery sliding past in reverse.

Tomorrow,once Azura’s wedding was over,I would be leaving too.

Beside me,Selene suddenly giggled at her phone.“That guy who hit on me just now sent me a message on WhatsApp.”

Darian’s face was expressionless,but his tone brooked no argument.“Delete him.”

“I think I should give it a try.”

“I said,delete him.”

Selene stuck out her tongue.“Darian,you’re stricter than a boyfriend.”

In the rearview mirror,I caught a flash of jealousy in his eyes.But I no longer felt anything.

When we got back to the apartment,I shut myself in my room to pack my luggage.

At least this trip back had been useful—I wouldn’t have to trouble Darian to ship my things for me.

Maybe I was too exhausted.I lay down on the bed and accidentally fell asleep.

When I woke up,I immediately sensed something strange on my head.Panicked,I rushed into the bathroom—only to see my waist-length hair hacked short,ragged like it had been chewed by a dog.

Out in the living room,Selene was toying with the locks she had just chopped off from me.

“Who gave you permission to cut off my hair!”

Chapter 5

She blinked innocently,her face all wide-eyed pretense.“Isn’t everything of yours my brother’s too?I thought it looked nice,so what’s wrong with me taking it for a wig?”

I couldn’t hold back—a slap cracked across her face.

The sharp sound had barely faded before I was shoved hard,my freshly stitched wound smashing against the edge of the coffee table and splitting open again,blood gushing out.

Darian acted as if he hadn’t seen a thing,standing protectively in front of Selene,his gaze on me icy cold.“Selene already apologized to you.Why can’t you just let her go?”

I struggled to push myself up from the floor,meeting his eyes head-on.

“Are you blind?She’s the one who cut my hair.”

Darian’s eyes darkened.He picked up the scissors and snipped off a tiny strand from Selene’s head.“Now we’re even.”

Selene’s face lit up with smug satisfaction.“Ruby,my brother cut my hair too.If you keep making a fuss,then you’re the one in the wrong.”

I stared at that pitiful little lock of hair in his hand and couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

Yes,after all—it’s just hair.

Just a shirt.

Just a Valentine's Day.

All these years,I’d endured enough—endured so much that I no longer wanted to yield to their twisted sibling bond.

I went upstairs,grabbed my luggage and walked straight out the door.

At the wedding venue,after finishing my makeup and changing into the bridesmaid’s dress,my mood finally began to settle.

But Darian still came after me,his expression calm and indifferent.“Sorry,I lost my temper just now.I’ll make it up to you.I promise,we’ll get married soon…”

I cut him off,my voice steady.“Darian,you clearly love Selene.Why do you still insist on tangling with me?”

He suddenly jerked his head up,his face twisting in shock.“What are you talking about?How could I ever like my own sister?”

“You know it in your heart.”

Darian grabbed my hand,his grip so tight it hurt.“Where are you going?I won’t marry anyone but you.”

I wrenched free with effort.“That’s none of your business.”

Without looking back,I walked away—completely missing the venom flashing across Selene’s face.

The wedding began on schedule.The groom led the bride down the aisle and the big screen started playing clips of their love story.

I glanced at the time—two hours left until my flight.

I was just about to wait for Azura to step down so I could say goodbye,when suddenly—

The screen went black.

In the next second,my private photos filled the entire display.

Ela unnaru? Antha Kushalamena? How was your long weekend? Did you do anything fun?

I ended up taking a trip with my friends, they're good people you'll meet them too soon, pretty sure you'd like them too. 

I started the trip working at the airport lounge thanks to a delayed flight, in sea of ThinkPads & people drowning their sorrows in free alcohol whilst they keep the world moving. I saw a young couple in there, ngl G lo kalindi. Jealousy maybe but bruh the airport lounge is a temple where serious people are doing serious things not for you two to schmooze. 

But then, I saw an older couple, vallani chusthe muchata vesindi. Like they had this peace around them, completing each other's sentences and orders. Like they had built this successful project called life and were probably on their Nth Sprint. Hopefully we'd get there someday. 

The plane ride was smooth, ended up watching some good documentaries but I didn't have your hand in mine and/or your head on my shoulder but hey I atleast got the aisle, until you probably want the window and I'd have to suffer in the middle seat till your man can afford business class. 

I was able to rent a great car fortunately(the best car I've ever driven easily), only could have been better if you were the passenger princess next to me. Only for you to yap my ears off over the roar of the twin turbo V6. Idk guess I'd want the bubbly you to balance my calm. 

There was a lot of trekking, climbed kondas with no sight of bangaru konda(you) 🫤. It'd be nice to support each other through the ups and downs just like how that old couple probably did throughout their life. Lots of pain, agony and resilience just like life in general ig.

Tried lots of great food and coffee on this trip, something I'd love to experience with you. Can't wait to go food trails and café runs with you.  Hope you're a foodie too!

Well, I've got a list of places and scenic drives I'd love to experience with you but mind you that list keeps reducing the longer you take to come into my life. So tvaraga ocheyi ig! We've got a fun trip planned for December!

Have a great week/month/year ahead! Glad that the time before I bump into you reduces with each passing day.

This story happened last year but after hearing other stories I thought it was just crazy enough to share and I'd love to hear your hot takes...see what I did there 😏

So this is a long one so strap yourselves in and get your popcorn ready, obviously don't eat and drive haha. ALSO all names and details of this story are changed for privacy lol. Also also, I do not have patreon cause I'm a broke uni student and the US dollar is double the Australian one so please if you read this story read it on the free podcast, love you all so much and hope you enjoy this rollercoaster. <3  

Some context, I (21f) am a lesbian and I work at a company where I work at different services. So towards the end of 2023, I work at one service just doing my job. This is where I meet this one girl Jenna. Now let me preface this by saying Jenna is stunning, and exactly my type lol. Long dark hair, blue eyes just gorgeous and a really nice smile too. Let me also preface that I try not to mix work and friendship/dating because it just gets messy and complicated. I'm also pretty quiet about my sexuality at work cause it's no one's business. 

So off the bat, I'm just being nice because she seems friendly enough. She asks if I'm gay to which I say yes, she then apologises for being so forward and I say it's okay. She starts flirting with me very clearly, asks if I have instagram and talks about how she has these rainbow laces on her favourite shoes. I'm like cool, I give her my instagram and we start talking. Again I was a bit on edge as I'd never been flirted with so openly before lol and didn't really know what to do with it. 

So, we start talking and it turns out we've got a few things in common. Initially as friends but it slowly turns into something more. Finally one of my friends convinces me to ask her out so I do. I message something along the lines of 'hey you're really cute I hope I'm not reading too much into things but would you want to go on a date sometime?' then I throw my phone away cause I'm nervous lol. 

She says yes and we begin organising a day and time. Keep in mind she's told me she's a lesbian we've spoken on the phone and she says she's worried about her family finding out. Valid af. My mindset is 'don't worry I am happy to be your secret'...I'm silly I know, but I really clicked with this girl and she wasn't presenting any red flags...yet lol. So we decide on mini golf and organise a day to go, she says yes and I'm all excited. I go get my hair recoloured, I go shopping with my friend specifically to find an outfit for this date, things are looking up. She cancels...day of. It sucks but she had to look after her cousin, so it makes sense. So we reschedule for the following week. Again I'm all excited and she then proceeds to ghost me. not responding to any messages etc so I assume the date isn't happening. I send her a message, concerned, and just ask if everything's okay. She responds about a week later and explains she can't do this and she's not out so it's too hard and hopes I find someone I deserve.

Real sweet message, not going to lie I was hurt ofc but whatever it is what it is. So I begin working at this one service I really enjoy working at, it has a pretty chill manager and staff environment. I didn't realise she'd also been working there often. oops. So around march we got rostered on together...it was hella awkward. Not wanting to out her I didn't say anything to our boss Hannah who asked if everything was okay, I said it's all good and not to worry. I messaged Jenna later that day and apologised for the awkwardness and that it's all good, happy to be friends, work colleagues or whatever. 

Now at this service there was a bit of favouritism going on with out manager, so often it was Hannah, Jenna, Sarah and myself working there. I got to know the girls better and it was a really fun work environment. Eventually I got asked to see a movie with them, they always hangout after work and I was a bit unsure as I have had issues with friends in the past and saw this as a pity invite rather than a genuine one. Before this movie happened Jenna asked if I wanted to get coffee and talk. now I don't know about you but getting coffee and talking doesn't sound like a friend activity. There were still some unresolved feelings and I thought hey why the hell not. It never happened lol. 

I had also become quite close with Hannah at this point and we'd talk in the office after work sometimes. On one of the closing shifts, I was talking to Hannah, and she asked me about Jenna, we got to talking and I was finally open about everything that had happened and how there was still some unresolved feelings cause there wasn't any real closure, on my end at least. (I'm also delusional as hell). Hannah then explained to me that Jenna had told her a very similar story after our awkward shift but also that she wasn't even gay and wasn't into me and had just been confused and used me as an experiment. This hurt me a lot, obviously, because I liked her a lot and thought she could've just communicated hey I'm not sure if I'm gay idk if I want to go on this date. 

I'm a songwriter so I wrote two songs about it, naturally, cause that's how I process things. (This will become important later). So we go to the movies, it's the 2nd inside out movie and I get emotional as hell cause screw you Pixar haha. Jenna comforts me, and when Hannah and Sarah get snacks she explains she heard what Hannah had said to me and that it wasn't true. she told me she was genuinely into me then and was just scared to go on a date because she really liked me and she wasn't out. she admitted she was most likely bi or a lesbian and I said there's no pressure to figure it all out and I'd be here to support her as a friend if she needed it. 

So flash forward through the year and shit starts getting...hella gay as I'd put it. I'm happy to remain friends with Jenna, but she starts giving me signs she's into me again and flirting with me...again. It's really confusing for me obviously cause I don't know what she wants. Some examples...I'm a hugger and so is she, sometimes she'd hug me and say goodbye and those hugs would last way longer than a friendly hug should. Also, we had this debate back and forth about what was better tea or coffee, the correct answer is coffee (coming from the coffee capital of the world 🥰). 

So we decided to put it to the test, I'd bring her in a coffee and she'd bring me in a tea. So that became routine, every morning we'd bring in each other a coffee/tea and it was really nice. We bonded over stupid stuff like movies, music etc and became really close. I eventually stopped bringing her in a tea and hugging her for so long, in fact she was the one who'd initiate the hugs (this is also important later). Again I was probably being delusional but she kept flirting with me and giving me signs she was into me, whilst also talking about how she's pretty sure she's a lesbian etc. I tried to keep the friendship boundary as best I could though, because I was confused. 

I wasn't sure if she just had a flirty personality or what but I finally decided after all this gay shit I finally decided enough was enough. I either needed to know she was or wasn't into me so I could move on for my own gosh darn sanity. So I finally called her one night and we ended up talking about school. My school life wasn't the best...people are assholes, and my best friend ended up being a total flipping narcissist. I opened up to her about all of this because I trusted her and I felt safe enough to tell her this, which wasn't easy. I then asked what was going on here, because I was into her and thought there was something there but wasn't sure what. I told her the ball was in her court and it was up to her to tell me how she was feeling about the situation. I then had to get off the phone but continued to message her, she told me that she liked me too and wasn't sure half the time if we were friends or if it was gay lol. 

She confessed that she was a lesbian and still wasn't out but wanted to see where things went and wanted to remain friends and figure it out together. So I'm hella excited but it doesn't really lead anywhere and she doesn't seem that interested. my friends who know all the tea tell me that's how they let guys down when they're not actually interested so I give up and go to New York. Which was the best damn decision and one of my favourite places on earth! Anyway I come back and Hannah begins organising her 21st party, which is super exciting. At this point Jenna tells me she's come out to her family as a lesbian, but later Hannah brings up the fact she wasn't able to go to see a guy she liked, which confused me but whatever. I accept the fact that Jenna and I are friends and make light of the fact I wrote some songs when I was mad at her initially, because I genuinely thought it was funny and not a strange thing to do. I often make jokes with other friends of mine about songs I've written when I initially didn't like them or how far we've come etc, and she also thinks it's quite funny. Keep in mind too my first ex was in the closet and ended up ghosting me so I've written a few songs about her too. 

It seemed though that any song I had written after this whole situation with Jenna, she thought was about her. I went and got my nails done with Sarah and Jenna and was talking about how I'd written another perspective of this town about a girl who had to let a relationship go because it was closeted, Jenna raised an eyebrow thinking it was about her and I shook my head, NOT EVERYTHING'S ABOUT YOU JENNA. Anyway Hannah's 21st rolls around and it doesn't end up happening, Jenna drops all her shifts, switches services and get's in a massive fight with Hannah and Sarah because she can be pretty flaky.  

So, week after that Hannah, Sarah and I sit down and chat about what the heck just happened and how they're not friends with Jenna anymore. I finally explain everything I did and here's the kicker. Jenna...isn't a lesbian. Never was never has been...she made it all up. Not only that she'd been talking about me behind my back since the very start. She was saying to Hannah and Sarah that I was a weird, creepy, delusional lesbian. 

She says that I misconstrued things and read into the wrong things. She said she'd go on a date with me cause she felt sorry for me. She also said I was way too obsessed with what happened in high school and I should just get over it (this was the same night I cried to her about it after she told me it's okay and to open up). She also said that even if she was gay, I wasn't her type and she'd never be into someone like me. She said I needed to get over my obsession with her (even though she was leading me on all year) and said every song I wrote was about her (again not true I've written over 170 songs at this point and only 2 are about her). She said that she didn't know the coffee was going to turn into a thing and it was weird I'd always bring one in-she never told me this and she was the one who suggested it. She said that she felt weird and uncomfortable when she hugged me (I didn't know this) 

She also said that Hannah (who's straight) shouldn't flirt with me because I'd become obsessed with her and she'd become my next victim. Keep in mind I try my hardest to be nice to everyone and make it very clear to people please tell me if I am making you uncomfortable at any point. Nothing was communicated to me. she also totally gaslighted the situation to the point where she was a victim and I was some weird predatory lesbian or some shit. Keep in mind I genuinely cared about her as a person I didn't care if we dated or not and for most of the year she was flirting with me and leading me on, I was just trying to keep the situation friendly. Hannah also told me that she'd been talking to this guy for ages, flirting with him and leading him on too but didn't want it brought up around me...on purpose so she could keep up the facade of leading me on. Anyway turns out the whole thing was just some strange homophobic ego boost. 

So obviously I was devastated and beyond pissed off. I texted her and said guess you're an and sent the song bad liar. thought it was funny but she blocked me. So I wanted to send her a message and use her own words against her, I texted her something along the lines of I'm sorry to hear I'm such a delusional crazy lesbian, don't worry I'm obsessed with Hannah, she can become my next victim. I obviously shouldn't have messaged her twice and sent the song bad liar. it was petty. I was just so angry and wanted to get back at her. So she told a mutual friend she was considering going to HR told and spread this story to God knows who else in the company. She also told the mutual friend that she was afraid to go to the shops and that I'd run into her and try and attack her or some shit...girl what? 

Oh yeah and I found out later, from one of my friends I got her a job working there that my boss Hannah had also been talking mad crap about me behind my back...so 🤪 that's a whole other story.

So yeah... there's my story. Gays, straights, whoever. Don't settle for less and don't fall for crazy chicks. I love you, the end.",2,1756790100.0,TwoHotTakes,17,0.6,False

We want CoHub to feel like a real **community hub** — a place that grows with you. And that’s where we need your help. So we wanna ask:

* What would make CoHub even better for you? 

* What would make you excited to keep coming back?
* Any services, activities, or amenities you wish were available in Bataan that we could add? 
* How can we serve you better — whether for studying, events, or just tambay time?

We really want CoHub to feel like YOUR space too, so any suggestions are super welcome. Whether it’s study-friendly perks, fun hangouts, creative collabs, or even small everyday comforts — we’re all ears. 

Your input matters a lot, and it can help us make CoHub truly for the Bataan community.

My sister had some difficulties emotionally and mentally in high school (F16/17 at the time) and was helped by a male teacher. This teacher continued to pursue an inappropriately close relationship with her after high school. During high school and at graduation she bought him gifts and was very close to him. Now she is 19, and he texts her regularly.

He texts things that feel personal but she has not told us about anything sexual in nature. He asked her to get coffee recently and the conversation lasted 5 hours at which point my mother told her to come home immediately. She claims she tried to leave but he kept the conversation going.

He is about 30 now and lets her call him by his first name. He seems to ONLY be friends with her and her friends and no other former students. He no longer works at that high school.

My sister has mental illness unfortunately and I’m afraid she would be easily manipulated and harmed. I believe their relationship is inappropriate and that he should back off.

Since my sister is an adult now, what are my options? How can I get him to understand our opinions on their relationship? My family all has a bad gut feeling about him but no proof of something explicitly being grooming. He talks to her about his mental illness and personal, sympathy garnering stories like about his dog’s death.

I am very sensitive to medications. On my last day 2 of quitting the Anxiety was so bad I was unable to function or think properly at all. My wife had to give me one of her Buspirone to take and that in itself was a nightmare. Took 3 days to recover just from that.

I dont want to live like this anymore. I am a father of 3 and I am by no means weak, but the Anxiety and fear I have from these things is crippling. 

Please tell me exactly what supplements you guys used to help you quit and things that helped you out. I have an at home gym, and am decently in shape. We eat pretty healthy in my house also. I will be trying to wuit again tomorrow after a night's sleep tonight so I can get an 8-9 hour headscarf on cold turkey yet again.

Uppers are a no go for me, can't even drink coffee or tea. Sends me into full blown panic attacks. Ashwaghanda does not work for me, it cracks me out.

1n6aptn,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1n6aptn/how_ive_solved_my_insomnia/,How I've solved my insomnia,"I've suffered from insomnia for a big part of my life and I've finally come to a point where I can say it's almost gone. Of course there are a few days per month where I still struggle to fall asleep, but it's nowhere near as bad as what it was before. I thought I could share some tips that worked for me. 
1. No more caffeine. I quit my coffee intake entirely and only drink water and occasionally tea.
2. No phone or screen an hour before bed. I turned off everything and read a book or write in my journal to empty my thoughts.
3. Fasting. This has helped me the most. Going to bed on an empty stomach and postponing eating breakfast has cleared my head which makes falling asleep easier.
4. Recognising stressmakers and eliminating them to the best of my ability. This is an important one, but also not always easy to realise. For work, I tried to minimise social interaction so my battery doesn't get drained. When I'm at home, I try to relax by really relaxing and not scrolling or being on my phone.
5. Walks. Going on walks helps me get tired enough to fall asleep better.
6. Minimise carb intake. This one helped me personally, but it's a diet change, so it could depend on the individual. Basically, I feel bloated when I eat carb heavy food and reducing it made me less bloated, which someone also made me feel lighter and therefore made falling asleep easier. I switched to yoghurt based smoothies instead.
7. No more nicotine. I did a cold turkey on cigarettes. (I recommend doing this during a holiday, because together with the diet change and quitting coffee it gave me a headache for a good week or two.)
8. Reading. It might sound silly, but finding escapism from daily problems in books help me clear my head before falling asleep. 
9. Cold showers. I don't do this often, but sometimes when I feel overwhelmed they help. 
10. Stretching. I'm not talking about yoga but super basic stretches to get the pressure off of my shoulders and neck, since I sometimes sit and lay in the same position for a long period of time.

These aren't the 10 commandments or anything, but rather things I played around with and that worked well for me and could maybe also help you. Basically doing all of these together helped me a lot. 
I also noticed that my insomnia was anxiety based, so I also think these just helped clear my head which made sleeping easier. 

I hope they help and I can answer any questions if you like :)

On my old phone, I just downloaded the VPN app and it was pretty straightforward, but the iPhone settings felt a bit confusing.

I ended up downloading one of the popular VPN apps and noticed it asked me to allow a “VPN configuration” in settings, which threw me off at first because I wasn’t sure if that was normal or if it was messing with my phone. It seems to work fine now, but I’d rather know if there’s a better or simpler way to do it, or if I should just stick to using the app. How do you guys usually set up your VPN on iPhone?

I don’t know what you’re up to these days, it’s better that I don’t, but I Hope all is well. I’m still working to be a better person.

Don’t know if you and K got back together after you started your new job. Not my business, nor do I care or want to know and Hope that’s respected for once.

We live in the city near one another, it’s definitely possible we will accidentally run into one another at some point. Saw a dog that looked like R yesterday. Don’t think it was ex hubby, hair too long after checking old pics. I was curious, lol.

I don’t expect you to see this, nor do I want you to. I know I could text this to you if I wanted — we are removed from Twitter and blocked from IG — but not on texting — but I wanted to say to say that I Hope things are going okay for you, I know you’ve had a lot on your plate.

I found someone new and we made it official. Before our first date I cried a few tears as it finally was fully setting in this was the new reality of not talking *and* seeing others. Instead of seeing others and (allegedly) fixing things. Mourning what once was with us.

I won’t make the same mistakes I did with you with this person. I’m sorry you had to be affected gravely by all of my immaturities and shortcomings.

I also met up with M last week to apologize for their face like I once said I would. No coffee, just in public. Haven’t spoken since, just making peace — to some degree. Realized just how much of a POS I was and am to many people and how I’ve hurt a lot of folks. I’m not proud.

Day 1 Upper Body - 20 MINS OF CARDIO

Day 2 Lower Body - 20 MINS OF CARDIO

Day 3 Upper Body - 20 MINS OF CARDIO

Day 4 Full Body - 20 MINS OF CARDIO

DAY 5,6,7 CARDIO at home on treadmill (but I noticed I reset on day 1 again)

Alongside this I also own a pizzeria which I guess I get movement in too which I work 7 days a week 11am -5PM+ aswell my OMAD day goes like 1 black coffee from morning 11am until 5ish then I’ll eat my meal which consists of protein and salad around 6ish and at night around 8 or 9 whey protein powder mixed with 2%milk

By doing what I’ve done ive lost weight clothes have gotten loose notice definition building and can feel muscles certain body parts aren’t sagging as before etc

1.	⁠is weight lifting good for losing weight or should I do more cardio?
2.	⁠Is my diet good/am I on the right track?
3.	⁠Is getting to 230ib by October 2026 viable?

Sharing our 3D 2N trip to Bantayan Island for 2 persons! All prices shown below are for 2 :) 

We stayed at La Playa Estrella (P5,400, 3D2N). It has a good beachfront, which is ideal when we just want to chill. 

Day 1: Arrival and Bantayan visit
We took the 0200 am bus to Bantayan via Kawit, Medellin (P520 + P40 terminal fee). We arrived at Kawit Port at 0530 am (P40 terminal fee), boarded the ferry (P500) at 0600 am, and arrived at Sta. Fe by 0815. We were picked up by the hotel, and we left our bags with them. 
Destinations: 
- Coco’s Café - we ordered a smoothie bowl, english breakfast, coffee, and juice (P750)
- Bantayan proper - We took a tricycle to Bantayan (P120). We walked around the plaza, church, and buwad market. 
- Kermit’s café - we ordered a slice of cake (great selection; we had a pistachio cake), strawberry matcha (too sweet for me), and lemonade (P450) 
- Dinner at I love Kinhason - I highly recommend their shrimp and scallops! (P750)

Day 2: Sta. Fe Tour
We had our breakfast at the hotel (P590) and booked a tricycle tour (P800). 
Destinations:
- Mangrove forest (P150) - We arrived at around 0830 & were the only tourists. The boardwalk is quite long but may resting spots naman. 
- The Ruins - the building was good but nothing much to do after taking pics. 
- Ogtong cave (P600) - We arrived at around 1000 am, and there was just 1 group at the cave. Super good! We stayed for an hour, and we won’t mind staying longer if the sched allows. 
- Baigdad lagoon beach (P500) - We walked to the lagoon instead of taking the boat (around 15 mins). Super ganda, next time we plan on spending an entire day here with our own foods. Food here was a bit expensive (P640 for scallops, dragonfruit shake, and coconut water). 
- Lunch at Bantayan Burrito (P700) - we had a quesadilla and burrito. 
- Dinner at Sta. Fe beach club (P1430) - we had scallops, sizzling squid, chop suey, and some cocktails. We took a tricycle to and from here (P180)

Day 3: By the beach & departure
We spent the last day relaxing by the beach and preparing for our departure. We had our breakfast (P700) and lunch (P480) at the hotel. May nagtitinda ng scallops + sukang sawsawan by the beach (P100).
We arrived at the port around 1300, and took the ferry to Hagnaya (P500 + P40 terminal fee) at 1330. We boarded the Ceres bus at around 1530 (P450), and arrived at our address at Cebu north by 2000. 

Some notes: 
- We decided to commute. It was cheaper and more convenient for us because we’re not familiar driving up north. If we’d be a group of 4 or more, I believe sulit if you’ll bring/rent a car. 
- We opted for the early morning bus so we can start the gala earlier. 
- Since it was monsoon season, medyo malumot and maalon ang beaches at the south side of the island. 
- Super lami ang scallops in Bantayan indeed. We had scallops everyday. The best one we had was the one sold by the beach from walking vendors! 
- We would definitely go back to Baigad Lagoon Beach for an entire day! 
- We wanted to spend this trip to be focused on Sta. Fe mostly. We might do another one for other parts of the island. 

Overall, it was an amazing trip! Bantayan was very laid back and perfect for relaxing. We had the trip at the end of July, and we were lucky that the weather was good enough during our biyahe. Happy trip!",3,1756788157.0,phtravel,1,0.72,False

Sure, to people who act insincerely just to get into someone else’s pants, screw you. 

But being on the side of someone who likes stuff that falls into the “performative male” category, this unwanted label that now exists and gets generally slapped on every male feels like bullying. I want to continue to act authentically, but I don’t want people who I care about to think this about me.

Now then, I recently learnt that someone that I do care for deeply thinks that I am performative, just because I started drinking matcha. For the longest time, I have been a coffee lover. When the matcha trend started, I didn’t hop onto it. I generally don’t like hopping on random bandwagons.  Later, someone told me matcha helped them feel less sluggish over the day (which I felt so too when drinking coffee) and I started trying to drink some matcha. Now, I do a coffee in the morning and maybe a matcha at lunch, purely from a caffeine management reason.

It hurts me knowing that this person that I care for has given me this label. It hurts that I was given the label because I tried something that was trendy and that fell in the “performative male starter pack” category. It hurts that it feels wrong when there’s nothing wrong about this.

Well deep down, I know that like all social media trends, this will die down soon. And everything above is probably my hyperemotional self speaking. But I still wanna speak about how this all feels to me.",0,1756788000.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.5,False

I typically eat a breakfast of Quaker instant oats with 2% milk and have a coffee with 2% milk, and because this is an everyday breakfast for me, I have a pretty good idea of what happens to my blood sugar - it rises from around 80 mg/dL to 140 very quickly. 

This is my third day on Triz, I only slept 3 hours last night and usually this is enough to make my blood sugar yo-yo with corresponding food cravings. However that same breakfast had a far smaller rise in blood sugar and it came back down pretty quickly even without any walking or exercise. 

I know triz increases insulin sensitivity but this change on the first microdose of just 1mg was surprising to me. 

First picture showing 82 mg/dL is from today on Trizepatide, and the second picture is from the day before I took my first shot. The difference was very interesting to me. ",3,1756787290.0,tirzepatidecompound,2,1.0,False

1n6a3ag,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1n6a3ag/my_chaotic_kitchen_routine_that_somehow_keeps_me/,my chaotic kitchen routine that somehow keeps me from stress eating goldfish crackers,"real talk: i used to stand in the pantry eating my kids snacks like some kind of feral raccoon when parenting got overwhelming. here's the messy system that actually works for me now.

**the setup:**

- sunday: make a huge batch of overnight oats (6 jars, different flavors)
- monday: prep vegetables while kids do screen time (dont judge)
- daily: ozzi drink around 3pm when the witching hour begins
- evening: preset tomorrow's coffee so i dont murder anyone

**why this works:** the ozzi thing was accidental. picked it up thinking it might help with my constant snacking but turns out it kills those 4pm ""i need chocolate or someone dies"" moments. now when my 4 year old has a meltdown about his socks being ""too socky"" i can actually parent instead of stress eating.

**the chaos management:**

- pre-portioned snacks for everyone including me (apple slices, cheese sticks)
- one pot meals only - if it needs more than one pan it doesnt happen
- backup plan is always cereal for dinner and thats okay
- water bottles everywhere because dehydration makes everything worse

**reality check:** this only works like 70% of the time. some days we still eat goldfish for lunch and order pizza. but having any system is better than the complete free-for-all i was living before.

the biggest win is not going to bed feeling guilty about what i ate during survival mode parenting. that mental relief alone was worth figuring this out.

what are your ""good enough"" strategies for not eating your feelings when kids are being absolute chaos monsters?",10,1756787049.0,breakingmom,3,0.92,False
1n6a2at,https://www.reddit.com/r/serialkillers/comments/1n6a2at/the_unsolved_case_of_costa_ricas_el_psicópata/,The Unsolved Case of Costa Rica's El Psicópata,"El Psicópata is the alias of an unidentified Costa Rican serial killer who was responsible for the murders of at least 19 people between 1986 and 1996. His victims were primarily single women or heterosexual couples. He would often attack them in isolated areas between the cities of Cartago, Curridabat, and Desamparados, an area that became known as ""the triangle of death.""

The killer's first crime is believed to have been the murder of Ligia Camacho Bermudez in 1987. Although this particular crime's modus operandi differed from the others, ballistic tests connected it to the same killer. The victims were often found shot to death, and in 2005, a submachine gun similar to the one used in the crimes was found buried in the ""death triangle"" area, but ballistic analysis did not confirm it was the murder weapon.
 

On the night of August 21, 1988, the killer murdered the couple of Víctor Julio Hernández and Aracely Astúa in a coffee plantation in San Vicente, La Unión Cartago.


The last suspected crime occurred on October 26, 1996, in Patarrá, Desamparados, when Mauricio Cordero and Ileana Álvarez were shot to death. Costa Rican police theorized that he may have suffered some psychological trauma in his youth, possibly related to his mother or a romantic partner, due to his cruelty towards women. Although there were several suspects and theories, including one that claimed he was a former guerrilla soldier who had been presumed dead, the case remains unsolved, and the investigations since expired under Costa Rican law.

A composite sketch of the killer was created based on witness descriptions. The suspect was described as a man of Costa Rican origin who lived in Nicaragua (although is one of the possibilities), approximately 5'7"" tall, with a thin build. He had dark brown hair combed back, and a thin mustache. He was said to have a cold stare. Some witnesses also described him as having a long face.
