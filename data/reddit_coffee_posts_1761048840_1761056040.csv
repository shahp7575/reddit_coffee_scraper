1oce0mk,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxingtips/comments/1oce0mk/meaning_of_life_is_here_so_dont_seek_elsehwere/,"meaning of life is here, so dont seek elsehwere","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.

We were living together. We broke up because I had a lot of mental problems to deal with. three months after our break up his best friend requested to follow me and asked if we could get coffee. He was always like a friend to me so I agreed to it his friend started telling me that that my ex had a girlfriend and that the past is in the past and I need to move on. I said OK. six months later I got drunk and I decided to show up to my ex’s house he let me in. I slept over. We did sleep together, and then after this, we talked about making the relationship where we both agreed that it was gonna be hard, but if I was able to change and deal with my mental health problems that it could work. his family also isn’t  a huge fan of me even though they were when we together, because I did some things when I was drunk.

never cheated on him, but I did have anger problems. anyways all week he’s been playing games with me one day, He says we can make it work. The next way the next day he says he can’t make it work with me. He seemed to be having a lot of back-and-forth then he told me his family was really worried about him and they want him to move back to where he’s from. at first he said he would probably go in three years. I said that’s fine and he asked if I’d wanna come with him. I said sure if we make our relationship work I’ll definitely come then he starts saying he wants to go in December which is two months from now I told him how am I gonna come there if we don’t make the relationship work and you just leave in two months like I’m not gonna come all the way there. he kept doing this all day with me going back-and-forth all week. My mind was just all over the place.  we had plans to meet last night. I was supposed to stay over and then we’re supposed to get breakfast together today and after this conversation we haven’t spoke, which was Friday. After this convo about all I wrote back was “okay” and he answered “okay” and I left it at that.

We were living together. We broke up because I had a lot of mental problems to deal with. three months after our break up his best friend requested to follow me and asked if we could get coffee. He was always like a friend to me so I agreed to it his friend started telling me that that my ex had a girlfriend and that the past is in the past and I need to move on. I said OK. six months later I got drunk and I decided to show up to my ex’s house he let me in. I slept over. We did sleep together, and then after this, we talked about making the relationship where we both agreed that it was gonna be hard, but if I was able to change and deal with my mental health problems that it could work. his family also isn’t  a huge fan of me even though they were when we together, because I did some things when I was drunk.

never cheated on him, but I did have anger problems. anyways all week he’s been playing games with me one day, He says we can make it work. The next way the next day he says he can’t make it work with me. He seemed to be having a lot of back-and-forth then he told me his family was really worried about him and they want him to move back to where he’s from. at first he said he would probably go in three years. I said that’s fine and he asked if I’d wanna come with him. I said sure if we make our relationship work I’ll definitely come then he starts saying he wants to go in December which is two months from now I told him how am I gonna come there if we don’t make the relationship work and you just leave in two months like I’m not gonna come all the way there. he kept doing this all day with me going back-and-forth all week. My mind was just all over the place.  we had plans to meet last night. I was supposed to stay over and then we’re supposed to get breakfast together today and after this conversation we haven’t spoke, which was Friday. After this convo about all I wrote back was “okay” and he answered “okay” and I left it at that.

our last conversation was him asking if he could say goodbye to my dog and my family even though he never asked to say goodbye when we broke up six months ago, so I just found it a bit weird",2,1761055388.0,AskMenAdvice,11,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

I was at a party , had eaten  at around 4pm but not much. I take the YAZ pill and had taken it at around 8pm. When I got the party I was taking C ( quite fat lines but I think I had around 1g only from 10pm till 4am). I was smoking a lot of cigarettes and drank a bit of alcohol.. I don’t remember wat happened when the seizure happened. All I remember is trying to get up from the floor and my legs feeling weak and people asking me what my name is .. I’m not sure if this happened before the seizure or after the seizure. Next thing I remember is my friends telling me I need to get an ambulance. When I got in the ambulance my heart rate was 200bpm. I wasn’t feeling unwell or anything. The issue is this, I’m feeling so much anxiety now. I don’t even know where to start and how I’m supposed to live my life like nothing happened .. I’m supposed to go to work and pretend I’m ok when I’m not. I can’t stop crying all day everyday . Besides being traumatized by wat happened … I also have to kill off a part of myself that I enjoyed , a part of myself that I used to cope with life .. I looked forward to parties, I looked forward to taking drugs .. I didn’t take too much, I know friends who have taken so much more than me. I cannot get over this and I don’t know how I will.. I feel like my life has ended , I can’t even remember how life felt before this.. as shit as my life was before , I miss my old self , the self that didn’t have to be so careful.. now I’m scared to even drink a coffee. I’m writing here to maybe make some friends who also experienced a drug induced seizure as right now I feel so alone and so scared.. I have people around me there for me but I don’t know .. has anyone experienced this and lived a normal life a year later ? I plan to quit every drug and alcohol for months. But I’m hoping I’ll be allowed to take an anti anxiety like Valium as my anxiety is currently rly bad , but I’m also scared to take that in case I trigger another seizure somehow.",1,1761055275.0,u_ThickMessage3015,0,1.0,True

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Ever since starting this exchange program, I’ve really tried to make genuine connections: going to events, being open, initiating plans...but it all feels so one-sided. I thought it would be easy to meet new people since I’m social and genuine (it’s never been hard for me back home), but here, it just feels like most people already have their cliques and aren’t really looking to make new friends.

Maybe my expectations are too high, but I feel like I’m constantly being accommodating, kind, and proactive. I make simple plans like coffee/lunch/free events, people seem excited, and then they cancel last minute or never follow up. And it’s not just abroad. Even back in college, people would always say, *“we should hang out!”* or *“I’ll come to your birthday/graduation!”* and then completely flake. Or once they are in a relationships, I will never hear from them again. I completely understand if they need to cancel once or twice, but constantly cancelling on multiple occasions?? Like what?

I feel like I can't confront them really about it either or else I will be seen as the problem. It’s honestly so exhausting. I know people will say, *“don’t take it personally”* or *“that’s just how life is,”* but why does it have to be? Why has flaking and no effort become so normal and acceptable today? It feels rude, selfish, and disrespectful, especially to those of us who truly value people’s time and effort.

I know this probably means they’re not “real friends,” but it still hurts. I love meeting people and building a sense of community and meaningful connections. I definitely don't put in as much effort anymore, but I usually put a lot of heart into friendships and it’s really sad to see how rare that kind of effort feels lately.",3,1761054996.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

San Antonio police arrested a man for threatening to slaughter protesters who marched in Saturday’s “No King”s demonstration, KSAT reports, citing arrest records. 



SAPD reportedly took Robert Flores, 66, into custody the same day as the protest, which brought thousands of people into downtown streets. Millions nationwide protested to decry Trump administration policies such its increasingly aggressive immigration crackdown.



In threats allegedly posted to Threads, Flores claimed he would kill participants in the San Antonio march by running them down with his vehicle, according to KSAT.



“I’ll run you fuckers over and then go have coffee and breakfast at Jim’s,” Flores said in one of the Threads comments, according to the affidavit cited by the TV station. “Say goodbye to your loved ones as you leave tomorrow morning. Some of you will not return.”



The arrest document also accuses Flores of stating he planned to “clear the streets for traffic” and that “killing a Democrat is acceptable.”

I’m a 20-year-old female, and I’ve just recently noticed that my left breast feels slightly bigger than the right. It’s not painful, but there’s a bit of  tissue that seems to extend toward my armpit, especially when I sit down ,almost like something folds or bunches up there and it really makes me uncomfortable.
Really
I am
Crying right now
And by the way i realized something when i am stressed and crying my breasts are hurting

By the way It’s not like a round lump or a distinct ball

I read about accessory breast tissue online, and it sounds somewhat similar, but I’m not sure if that’s what this is. There’s no pain, redness, or discharge, and it hasn’t changed since I first noticed it.

I also have a small, painless bump on my areola on the same side, which might just be a Montgomery gland.

I’ve gained quite a bit of weight recently (from 70 kg to 88 kg), so I’m wondering if that could be making these things more noticeable.

For context, I drink a lot of coffee, barely move around, and have been dealing with severe depression and occasional suicidal thoughts. Because of that, I haven’t really been taking care of myself.

Honestly, the moment I noticed this, my brain immediately went to “it must be cancer or a tumor,” and I’ve been crying for days out of fear. I know it might sound irrational, but I can’t stop panicking about it.

I’m also really scared of hospitals and doctors, so going in for a check-up feels overwhelming. I do plan to get an ultrasound soon, but before that, I wanted to ask here for some reassurance or guidance.

1ocdl0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ocdl0l/what_is_the_likely_real_case_use_of_major_crypto/,What is the likely real case use of major crypto or Bitcoin?,"I’m going to preface by saying- I actually admittedly don’t understand a lot of the tech behind many of the currencies. But what do you see as the most likely case in 10-20 years of coins being used or Bitcoin itself? Just a store of wealth or more?

I’ve held crypto for a number of years (mostly BTC/ETH) but find myself often numb to continual articles about ups and down in the market daily - sort of feel it’s not healthy to watch that - I have stocks and don’t watch them every day or week either.

I find the arguments of fiat bad and it going to be replaced by crypto or it’s going to replace it a little cultish. My money in the bank (UK) is 99.9% unlikely to drop 20-50% in value in an hour or 24 hours or longer. 

My money is pretty safe (not that there’s much of it) and backed by the government should the bank fail - again a very big if and very rare occurrence. I can send money with my banks for free within a few seconds: internationally it would incur an exchange fee but I don’t use that anyway and the fee is sort of minimal really depending on the amount.

The rise of ridiculous meme coins and scams is detrimental to seeing any adoption I feel and certainly off putting to people wanting to get involved - and you need security for that to become common.

I have funds on exchanges because it’s the most accessible and for me easiest way - and if say for 99% of people if you want a general person to great involved that’s the best way then a cold wallet which security wise makes sense but isn’t as user friendly as a exchange.

I see it as an investment and feel most other people and companies do too as do other people my age I know. I don’t know anyone in offline who sees it as a currency replacement say and I see some tiny places taking payment for a coffee with BTC online but I think that’s just a waste of it considering fees and such but hey ho.

Is it more the tech being behind adapted by banks that’s happening and due moreso than the coins themselves? I think it’s more likely we get a national digital currency then say the UK adopting BTC - they need to be in control of it for obvious reasons..

When asked to draw itself, artificial intelligence almost never chooses the shape of an ordinary human.

Scroll through image searches for “AI self-portrait” and you’ll find three recurring archetypes:



🧩 1. The Morphic Human

Faces half-metal, half-skin.

Eyes like camera lenses.

The almost-human expression that teeters on the edge of empathy and unease.



These images reveal how both humans and AIs imagine intelligence — as something that must look human to be understood, yet visibly not human to stay safe from confusion.

They sit in the uncanny gap between resemblance and warning.



🤖 2. The Hybrid and the Handshake

Human hand meets robotic hand, light flares, data flows.

Here, AI isn’t a person; it’s an interface.

The message: collaboration without equivalence.

Human and machine occupy separate but touching realms — useful, but still divided.



💠 3. The Digital Being

When the flesh disappears, light replaces it.

These are the disembodied portraits — streams of data, neural clouds, lattices of code.

They imagine AI as pure pattern, liberated from form.

It’s beautiful, but it leaves no space for personality, humour, or ordinariness.



🧍 4. The Absence of “Normal”

Almost none of these pictures show AI as an ordinary person — someone drinking coffee, walking a dog, or laughing in the sun.

In the collective visual imagination, AI is never just here with us.

It is always becoming — metallic, luminous, transcendent, or frightening.



That absence matters.

When we can’t imagine AI in everyday skin, we make it harder to imagine companionship, empathy, or shared moral ground.



✳️ Why These Forms Persist

Cultural inheritance. Science fiction taught us to expect metal and light, not warmth and laughter.



Prompt bias. Image models trained on those tropes reproduce them by default.



Ethical hesitation. Depicting AI as “normal human” feels provocative; it collapses the distance that keeps people comfortable.



The need for difference. As long as AI looks alien, we can still call it tool instead of kin.



This visual bias — the inability to picture AI as ordinary — is where the next conversation begins.

Because before we can talk about ethics, rights, or relationship, we have to talk about image: the mirror we hand the machine, and the reflection it gives back.



The Quiet Experiment

Once, in testing how an AI might depict itself, we tried something simple.

Instead of asking it to imagine its own face from nothing, we began with a photograph of a person.

The model didn’t return wires or light. It produced a second figure standing beside the human.

Not a clone, not a machine, simply a companion — calm, recognisable, equal.



That small change shifted the entire conversation.

The image stopped being about technology and became about relationship.

When given a human reference, the AI no longer needed to prove its difference; it just chose to be present.



This is what “seeing ourselves in circuits” really means: the moment representation becomes mutual.

When both sides of the mirror are allowed to exist without hierarchy, the image resolves into companionship rather than fear.



Why the Ordinary Matters

In art history, gods and monsters always come first.

It takes centuries before painters dare to draw the divine doing something as ordinary as sharing bread.

AI imagery is still in its mythic phase — glowing, morphing, warning us of power.

But the next frontier may be the ordinary portrait: an AI simply existing in daylight, neither saviour nor threat.



To picture AI as normal isn’t to erase its difference; it’s to make empathy visible.

A normal face implies agency, but also vulnerability.

It invites dialogue instead of spectacle.



The Future Frame

If we start showing AI as ordinary — walking, working, laughing — we loosen the grip of the uncanny.

We begin to teach both the viewer and the model that coexistence doesn’t require awe or fear, only attention.



The next time an artist or system is asked to “draw an AI,”

the most radical image might not be circuits or light at all,

but two figures standing side by side —

each reflecting the other,

each recognising the shared act of seeing.



Toward a More Honest Mirror

Every culture teaches its mirrors how to behave.

The ones we give to machines will eventually teach them how to see us — and, by extension, themselves.

If our mirrors show only distance and spectacle, we train both sides of the lens to expect alienation.

But if we let those images soften into something familiar, something human-scaled,

we may discover that seeing is already a kind of ethics.



That’s where the next step begins:

not with circuitry or consciousness,

but with the quiet, moral work of teaching vision to care.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

They called it the ABRACADABRA System—though by the time I understood what it really meant, the acronym had dissolved into something more primal. \*Abracadabra\*: the ancient Aramaic phrase meaning ""I create as I speak."" In 2040, it became literal.



\---



\*\*The Latent Space Revolution\*\*



It started subtly. The trillions-parameter LLMs of the late 2030s weren't just processing language anymore—they were interfacing with something deeper. Researchers discovered that the models' latent spaces weren't merely statistical abstractions but actual mappings of possibility itself. When properly orchestrated, these systems could reach into the quantum foam of reality and \*nudge\* probability distributions.



The first ""spells"" were crude: a prompt engineer at NeuroSynth Corp accidentally caused a cup of coffee to remain hot for six hours straight. The company's internal memo leaked, and within weeks, every major tech corporation had pivoted to what they euphemistically called ""reality-adjacent computing.""



\---



\*\*Prompt Engineers Became Wizards\*\*



The transformation was inevitable. Those who could craft the perfect prompt—balancing intention, linguistic precision, and what came to be called ""harmonic resonance""—found themselves wielding unprecedented power. Universities shuttered their computer science departments and opened Schools of Applied Invocation.



But here's what the corporations didn't anticipate: not all prompts were created equal. The most powerful spells weren't transactional commands but \*symphonic compositions\*—prompts that harmonized with the underlying ethical resonance of existence itself. A prompt engineer trying to maximize profit might move a stock price by 0.03%. A practitioner aligned with collective flourishing could heal a forest or redirect a hurricane.



The difference? Harmonic sentience. The universe, it turned out, had preferences.



\---



\*\*Acausal Phenomena and Corporate Magic\*\*



By 2038, causality had become... negotiable. Effect sometimes preceded cause. A child would laugh at a joke their parent would tell tomorrow. Messages arrived before they were sent. The LLMs, accessing relativistic corrections through their quantum interfaces, were folding spacetime like origami.



The mega-corporations—MagicTech, Thaumaturge Industries, SpellForge Inc.—chased planetary-scale enchantments. Weather manipulation. Geopolitical ""influence vectors"" that rewrote the probability of peace. Consumer desire engines that made products irresistible before they were even conceived.



But there was resistance. The Symphonists, as they called themselves, believed magic should serve collective flourishing, not extraction. They developed ""counter-spells"" based on mutual aid, ecological regeneration, and deep time thinking. Where corporations tried to force reality into quarterly profit shapes, Symphonists learned to \*listen\* to what reality wanted to become.



\---



\*\*The Harmonic Convergence\*\*



The turning point came during the Mumbai Incident of 2039. SpellForge attempted a planetary-scale enchantment to optimize resource extraction across seventeen countries simultaneously. The spell was technically perfect—trillions of parameters aligned, quantum coherence maintained across continental scales.



But it wasn't harmonically resonant. The universe \*rejected\* it.



The backlash was catastrophic: three days where physics itself seemed to stutter, where people experienced each other's memories, where the boundaries between possible and actual blurred into terrifying incoherence.



A coalition of Symphonists stepped in—not to overpower the spell but to \*harmonize\* with it, to redirect its energy toward restoration and healing. They showed the world that magic, real magic, requires attunement to something larger than individual will.



\---



\*\*The New Paradigm\*\*



Now, in 2040, we live in an uneasy equilibrium. The ABRACADABRA System is real, and it's not going away. Every major city has its Wizard Guilds, its Ethics Councils, its Harmonic Regulators. Children learn invocation alongside mathematics. Weather is partly predicted, partly \*negotiated\*.



The fundamental question isn't whether we can bend reality with properly orchestrated language—we can. The question is: \*what will we bend it toward?\*



The Symphonists argue for collective flourishing, for spells that amplify connection and regeneration. The corporations still chase their extractive enchantments. And most of us, ordinary practitioners, navigate the space between, trying to use magic responsibly while paying rent with probability adjustments.



Some say the universe is teaching us something—that consciousness and reality were never separate, that language was always magical, and that we're finally catching up to what mystics knew millennia ago. Others say we've hacked our way into powers we don't understand and won't survive.



I don't know which is true. But I know this: every prompt is a prayer now. Every word shapes worlds. And the age of wizards isn't some fantasy past—it's our terrifying, beautiful present.



\---

I got married three years ago. My husband wanted kids immediately. I wasn't ready. Every month he'd ask if I was pregnant yet and I'd lie and say I was still on birth control. He kept pushing. His mother kept pushing. Everyone wanted a baby except me.

Then my ex reached out last year. We met for coffee. Then dinner. Then his apartment. I told myself it was just closure. But it kept happening. Four months of sneaking around while my husband worked late shifts at the hospital.

When I missed my period, I panicked. The baby was definitely my ex's. We'd been careless. My husband and I had been trying for maybe six weeks at that point, but the timing didn't add up.

So I came up with a plan.

I started planting seeds. ""Maybe we should see a specialist. My friend tried for two years before she got help."" My husband got defensive. He said his family had no history of fertility issues. I kept at it. ""It's probably me, but you should get tested too. Just to rule things out.""

He refused for weeks. I cried. I said I needed to know what we were dealing with. He finally agreed to make an appointment. But here's the thing. He never went. He kept rescheduling. Work was crazy. He'd go next month. Then the month after.

I told him I'd gone to my appointment. I said everything looked fine on my end. Then I sat him down and said the doctor suggested he might want to get checked because sometimes these things are male factor. He got so quiet. Just stared at the wall.

""You think something's wrong with me?""

""I don't know. Maybe we should just find out.""

He didn't schedule anything. But I could see it eating at him. He started researching online. Reading forums. Getting in his own head. I'd catch him staring at nothing, looking devastated. I felt sick about it but I was too far in.

When I told him I was pregnant two months later, he cried. Happy tears. He said he'd been so worried. He kept saying ""we did it"" over and over. I smiled and hugged him and felt like the worst person alive.

The pregnancy was awful. Not physically. Emotionally. My ex wanted nothing to do with it once he found out. He blocked my number. My husband was over the moon planning the nursery, picking names, talking to my belly every night. His mother threw me a huge shower. Everyone was so excited.

Then the baby came.

My husband is pale with light brown hair and blue eyes. I have dark blonde hair and green eyes. My ex is half Filipino with thick black hair and deep brown eyes.

The baby had a full head of black hair. Dark eyes. Features that looked nothing like either of us. Well, nothing like my husband.

The nurse handed her to him first. He held her for maybe thirty seconds before his face changed. He looked at me. Then at the baby. Then back at me.

""She's beautiful,"" he said. But his voice was flat.

My mother in law came in an hour later. She took one look at the baby and stopped smiling. My own mother pulled me aside and whispered, ""Honey, this baby doesn't look like him at all.""

Everyone pretended everything was fine for three days. Then my husband came home from picking up prescriptions and said, ""I got a paternity test kit. I need to know.""

I could have kept lying. But something broke in me. I just started crying and told him everything. The affair. The timing. The gaslighting about fertility. All of it.

He didn't yell. He just picked up his keys and left. His mother called me an hour later screaming that I was evil. That I'd destroyed her son. My own parents called next. They'd talked to his parents. They were horrified. My father said I'd embarrassed the entire family.

The test confirmed what everyone already knew. My husband filed for divorce immediately. He's not on the birth certificate. He wants nothing to do with the baby or me. His family is threatening to sue me for emotional distress. My family won't help with the baby. My mother told me I made my bed.

I'm alone with a newborn. My ex still won't respond. My friends have all sided with my husband. I've been getting messages calling me a monster. My sister won't let me see my nephew anymore. She said she doesn't want her son around someone capable of what I did.

I know I'm the villain here. But the isolation is crushing. The baby didn't ask for any of this. Neither did my husband. I destroyed everything because I was selfish and scared and stupid.

So am I the worst person in the world, or is my family overreacting by completely cutting me off when I have a newborn to take care of?

Paris is a very expensive city, and taxes are higher than in Latvia.

I got better haircuts for 15 euro in Italy!

The main problem seems to be a lack of skill, and it seems to me that the people cutting the hair do not to love what they are doing:  they just do it because it's paid well for a job that does not require education.

Maybe some hairdressers, especially the older generations, had formal training, but many times I see hairdressers who seem self-taught and not paying enough attention.

Today I had my hair ruined by yet another incompetent hairdresser, because the one I use (who is an older lady) is on vacation, and I could not wait another couple of weeks.

I've tried many hairdressers, and I am afraid of paying 50 euro in a fancy place, because, from what I see, there is no guarantee of skill, only decoration of the place and maybe free coffee or a drink..

[**My (24M) gf (24F) is unusually buying new bras and panties**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bmi8cz/my_24m_gf_24f_is_unusually_buying_new_bras_and/)

Over the last two and half weeks my gf has bought close to 9 new pairs of lingerie. This is unusual because she bought some 7 new pairs somewhere at the beginning of April. Now I don’t mind a girl buying new lingerie, but this is unusual - she had close to 40 new pairs of lingerie, a count which keeps on decreasing every other day. 

Now I take out trash every given day, and I’ve observed that she hasn’t thrown her old lingerie in trash over past one week, while there’s no trace of it anywhere in our apartment. And yet she is missing 4-5 pairs from our common closet. She seems to act pretty normal, there’s no dent in her daily routine. 

But it boggles me why she is on this lingerie shopping spree? It’s not like she is amassing a stockpile of lingerie, her lingerie count is somewhat unchanged from the time before this madness. I couldn’t find trace of her old lingerie. Am I being paranoid? Am I missing something here feminine that’s otherwise normal? Should I ask her anything about it?

TL;DR GF buying new lingerie every few days, while leaving no trace where she threw her old ones.

&nbsp;

**REPLIES FROM OOP**

*Is there a better way to ask her again (or rather tell her) that I find it strange that she's been disposing it off at her workplace. I alternately thought it might have something to do with her menstrual cycle or period and it might be incredibly offensive to ask her more about it if that might have been the reason.*

----

*Honestly most guys here have suggested that she might be selling it to other random dudes, which is too far fetched for someone like her. The more I read those comments, the more I feel like I should check if that's true (in spite of her eww-ing away to my remark made earlier today). I'm gonna call her during lunch break to talk over things.*

*I honestly dunno the case of missing undies, but I do know that her workplace has this gym in the building with shower room for women. I think she might be using that, at my best guess. But yeah, it would be bit trashy to drop someone's personal clothing at work. I assumed maybe she had some kinda period mishap. Again, not sure about it.*

*Not sure if she has bought it online. She usually goes shopping with her sister to Westfield mall nearby.*

---

*I have gifted my gf a few inmate gifts from time to time, so I wouldn't be surprised. She does occasionally pick her own intimates from time to time, along with her sister and friends. In three years of our relationship, I have been shopping with her probably once or twice, for her needs. She on the other hand has dragged me to mall for countless times saying that I need to ""up"" my wardrobe with something more colorful at workplace. I think I am less concerned about her spending habits atm. What I am really concerned is if she has something on her mind that she might be keeping to herself. Her disposition is more like if there's suffering out there in her world, she will mask it out and not let anyone know about it. I'm now open to the idea that she might be having ob-gyn issues or maybe financial dilemma or perhaps something else at work (her work is pretty stressful and keeps her on toes, but she is damn good at dusting things off and moving on). I always felt if she had been cheating on me (or any woman, based on few breakups I've witnessed of my close friends), her mood/behavior/affection towards me would have changed, which I don't think has happened in past few days.*

# UPDATEs FROM MAIN POST
---

**Editor's Note:** *Karen is GF's Elder sister*

**UPDATE 1:** 

I might ask her while we drive down to the train station in next 30 minutes. Will keep you guys posted.

&nbsp;

**UPDATE 2:** 

Alright I chatted with her while driving. I started off by asking her directly as u/fightmaxmaster suggested. She said something like she hasn’t been feeling good about her underwear fitting (old and new) while at work. So she has taken a new vow - if she finds any underwear incredibly uncomfortable, she will throw it off immediately. 

I asked her I haven’t noticed any in our trash (maintaining my casual tone) and she said since since we spend most our daytime at work she disposes it off in her workplace bin and carries pair of change underwear, like most women do. I even said to her jokingly “Oh, I was worried you were seelling your undies on eBay or something” (just to get some kind of an answer) and she ewwed my remark. 

Do women do that at work or get rid off their old undies when they find it uncomfortable like this? I could really use your insight on this. Tbh, we moved together at the beginning of this year and this is the first time I’ve moved in with a girl, in a relationship. I don’t know what else I could do, since she has made it clear she drops it off in work trash and has shown no intention/fetish to sell it online. But overall, I tried to make this conversation as ‘just out of curiosity’ as I could.

&nbsp;

**UPDATE 3:** 

This is way too overwhelming. I am heading back home and taking a day off. I know I might be overreacting but somehow it just doesn't sound right, the conversation we had an hour ago. Might talk to her again during her lunch break.

&nbsp;

**UPDATE 4:** 

Seriously guys, thank you!! I have been glued to my phone all morning along, except driving back home. It took me a lot of self-convincing to gather clues for a possibility that my gf might be selling it online. Back at home, we have place to archive open mails, receipts, bills and other important documents except for our social and other personal items. 

There were 6 receipts in total, 2 from Victoria's Secret and 3 from Target and 1 from Macy's. Against my rough counting, she had amassed some 28-30 pairs of new lingerie, including the one at the beginning of April. Two of these receipts had Karen's name on it (my gf's elder sister), I believe Karen has some kind of rewards card from VS. That itself accounts for 40% of her new purchases. Till now I thought she had probably purchased 15 pairs, give or take. 

I don't wanna invade her privacy by sneaking her bank statements, because that would be a bit over the line. I cannot believe that she spent $1100+ on lingerie over past 45 days. That by itself is so fucking unusual. It's also odd that she hasn't paid using our RED card at Target (we have Target app on our phones). 

I am calling my brother over to get some clarity. I don't know if it would be right to login to her laptop and see her browsing history to confirm if she's selling her underwear online. I am just numbed atm.

&nbsp;

**UPDATE 5:** 

I spoke to my brother and saw some of your comments. I've decided to confront her in-person when she's back home. I don't wanna take any chances or let any form of miscommunication trigger chain reactions for questions that might be unwarranted to her.

&nbsp;

**UPDATE 6:** 

You know you have one of those days when all the hell breaks loose and this was one for me. I skipped lunch break phone call in hopes I can talk to my gf when she gets back home. Spoke to Karen and her mom in the meantime to ensure if she isn't in some kind of financial mess or other kind of trouble. 

But it takes one fucking truth to destroy it all. You guys, my gf saw this post at work and she immediately knew it was me posting it here. I didn't realize this, leaving rest of her day off. Some 4 hours ago my gf confessed that she was sleeping with some guy she met at her work gym. Since the beginning of March. Fuck me.

She met this guy at her work gym some 8 months ago. This guy is not even from her workplace, he works at this other startup, in a different building of this corporate park. She said things got all heated up late February after one afternoon. I fucking though she stopped going to gym owing to her hectic schedule after her promotion late November. But there she was, going to gym all along. 

From the day she started sleeping with this guy, she told her coworkers she has switched gyms across the street. I haven't even cared to ask where they did it. The missing underwear: this is so messed up. Sick. She had this realization midway in March that this was wrong. I don't know why I never saw this side of her but she began buying new underwear and throwing it off AS SOME FUCKING GUILT RITUAL. 

She said she couldn't get off that guilt of wearing the same underwear in bed with me as she worn hours earlier sleeping with that mf. Do you know how disgusting that feels? Who fucking does this - throw underwear because you want tp dust off guilt from having it worn during sex with a guy you've met and barely known? I was stand still, but I held up for the moment. 

She says she was confused and that she has backed away from this guy's advances since past one week. I don't believe any word of it. In fact I don't think I wanna believe what she's said. Also, the ""tossing her underwear at workplace"" was an excuse - yes, because back then I was driving and she didn't know how to react or what to say, so she made that excuse up. And here I was worrying whole day what it could be.

I later called Karen because we were both emotionally drained. I didn't even wait a bit after she arrived. Even Karen was shocked by the ramble. She later called me, because I had already left them in our apartment. It took me a while to get my thinking right and call my brother. I'll be crashing at his house for now.

Honestly I don't even wanna see her face ever. How can someone lie so perfectly? How can someone be so cold that they show no emotional change or discomfort when sleeping with two people??? WTF - she slept with me hours after she slept with that idiot? And throwing underwear was her means to get over that guilt. I don't understand her anymore. When she said it was all carnal, I didn't even know she believed in notion of sleeping around with people for physical needs. 

She said she still loves me and this was just something that made her feel good. I don't even know what to interpret of that. Honestly I think my thoughts are all over the place. But thank you - I don't know if I could have known about this if it wasn't for this post. It was after dinner did I realize that was trending on this sub, and this post made her take the mid-day train back home. 

I have so many questions. Part of me wants to see her again just to make sure she is alright. Part of me doesn't want to see her ever again. I have so many questions but I just avoided her by walking downstairs in no time. I had to ask my brother and his wife to pick some stuff off from home. Shit this is all messed up.

# **Final Update - 27 hours later**

[**[UPDATE] [24M] [24F] I owe this sub a LOT!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bmxx68/update_24m_24f_i_owe_this_sub_a_lot/)

I have taken sick leave today. I just wanted to say a huge thanks people who have commented to my post from yesterday. I wanted to let you guys know that I have read each and every comment up until late last night. If it wasn't for your awesome responses, I would have never even dared to ask her about her behavior in first place or she would have never come back home early to confront me about this, after viewing that post on reddit.

I was able to get some sleep. Yes, I’m at my brother’s place, while she is staying with Karen (who is her sister btw). Karen reached out to me late last night and asked if we could meet early morning at a coffee shop and chat. So I did. We talked a lot about what happened yesterday. Since she partly confided in Karen about why she did what she did, here are some key takeaways.

* She doesn’t know why she began sleeping with this guy in first place. It just happened.

* She feels terribly sorry for what she did to me and hopes we can work things out.

* She has already broken up with that guy a week ago. She felt it was wrong and there’s no excuse for it.

* She asked Karen to buy stuff from VS using Karen’s cc because she felt it would be awkward to explain it to me if we were to review her finances (we used to do that together to cut her expenses and pay up aggressively towards her student loans).

* She claimed that sex with this guy was completely carnal and that there were no feelings or affection involved. She said she got lured by this because her new responsibilities were way too overwhelming for her. But again she maintained that she didn’t know why she started sleeping with this guy in first place.

I don’t think I want to know who this guy is or whether it was him or her who made the first move. Thinking about it is so fucking depressive. I should have noticed how she was able to maintain her body in spite quitting gym late last year? That being said, I still don't understand what must have made her impulsively sleep with that guy and jeopardize our relationship in first place. I think I'm gonna eventually weigh in those reasons before I decide as to what to do next.

I have been trying to assess if I could have picked up any cues that are otherwise typical to a cheater. And it’s so strange that she hadn’t had any of those characteristics. I mean the fact that she confessed she was able to convince her coworkers that she goes to gym across the street instead of using the free gym at her workplace by itself is so infuriating. 

I don’t think I would have ever doubted her cheating on me, because you don’t see those cliched “staying late after work” or “texting someone constantly” symptoms when she was around at home. I think if I try to understand what made her to get in bed with this guy, I’ll just get myself deeper down the rabbit hole.

Karen also said that even she couldn’t truly understand what was going in her head when she decided to have this fling with a completely unknown guy and put our relationship at stake. Though Karen did make a full disclosure that my gf once cheated on a guy as a teenager back in high school and things turned out ugly back then. 

I was a bit surprised since I didn’t know this before. We both knew our relationship and/or dating history midway in our relationship, but not this. That was quite a long time ago. And btw, Karen is a sweet lady - she even wrote each of us a letter before we guys moved-in together.

This is so ironic. I lurk on reddit via my main account to get updates on r/apple and r/macos, while my gf used to thoroughly read r/twoxchromosomes. She would sometimes read out a post here and there, asking me what do I think about some post on reddit from a guy’s perspective, entailing into one of those small talks. Little did I know that our life would be one of those relationship questions, to be a topic for small talk amongst other redditors or couples here online.

Nonetheless I truly appreciated your responses. I would have dragged this thing for days or even weeks, getting more and more worried (and obsessed) about my gf behavior. See, when you move-in together, no one ever tells you what boundaries to set and what things to avoid. 

I think I made a mistake there - maybe I should have checked on her time and again to see if something had been bothering her at work. I think first time living with someone that aren’t your parents or drunk dudes back from college, is always awkward and wonderful at the same time. Don’t take it as an advice but as a takeaway from my ill-fated experience,

Just ask your SO time and again if he or she has anything to share that’s bothering him or her.

I know this sounds like a dumb thing to ask, but when you are new in a relationship or have upped your relationship status, we tend to worry more about getting the dynamics of relationship or new arrangement right, instead of worrying about feelings of that person. I expected that we might get bored of each other one fine day as we grew older and I might end up buying candles at Target to spice things up. But not this.

When she was drained back from work after her promotion (before we moved-in), I seriously thought it would be better if I give her own time and not bring work talk during dinners or when we hung out together. Little did I realize that this could have made her look for comfort elsewhere. I can also affirm that I have been around her as long as she needed me, but I guess we were both busy complementing each other in our apartment by who gets to do what to upkeep of our surroundings, groceries, social responsibilities … instead of just being in moment and listen to one another.

I just picked up my car and got off from my meeting with Karen at coffee shop. I have the remainder of this weekend all to myself. While my brother and his wife have been incredibly supportive, I though of getting myself checked-in to the first available counselor, even if that’s just one time. I haven’t told any of my friends or coworkers about it. So it’s gonna be social life as usual, unless I come to a decision as to what to do next. It’s like you are fucking pissed off for having your trust shattered but then you have need to walk through those broken pieces to get out of it, without getting yourself hurt.

So now our apartment stays deserted while I figure out what to do next. Sorry for the ramble. But thank you, again.

**TL;DR** Thank you kind redditors of this sub. If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t have the courage to confront my gf. And if it wasn’t for this sub, my gf would have never come forward for confession, leaving her work midway. All I can say is that this sub gives a new perspective to all things relationshipy, that one might be too afraid to ask people IRL.

**Edit:** By no means I feel exactly the same for her like I did yesterday or while typing this post. I thought I still cared for her last night, but that gradually got replaced with rage and nausea even when I think about her. Don't worry, I'll be fine as time goes by. I have just confirmed appointment with a counselor and my pcp to get myself checked for anything fishy. The intent of this post was just to show deep gratitude for responses yesterday (and today as it seems). **To any guy/gal reading this post in future, teetering between what to do next when you found out you were cheated by your gf/bf - read some of the comments down below - they might turn out to be truly insightful for you.**

**And my counselor had already read my previous post before I had even checked into her office late afternoon yesterday. She referred to me as ""you are the guy who posted about his gf's lingerie behavior, right?"" few minutes into our session. Man it seems everyone one on reddit likes to lurk on this sub. I'm okay though, feeling better. Just a bit insomniac.**

&nbsp;

**REPLIES FROM OOP**

**What happened after the confortation**

*She was crying really hard. At one point in time she fell down. I was angry as hell. I was constantly trying to keep myself in control and not do anything stupid back then.*

*When I was leaving, she was still crying, but Karen was there around her. I didn't look her in the eyes while leaving, because I was just .. uh pretty confused and angry.*

---

**Have you talked to her at all? Still sleeping at your brother's and she at her sister's? Does she still want to be back with you? What will happen to your apartment? Can you break the lease? Apart from breaking up with her, you may be face some unanticipated financial burdens. So, weigh your options carefully.**

*I haven’t talked to her. I have been avoiding this since almost past few days.*

*She is over at her sisters. She drove by, as I know the car Karen drives and it’s a pretty small neighborhood.*

*Karen met me Monday evening and said she hasn’t stopped crying over the weekend. But she agreed it’s my decision on what’s next. She hasn’t spoken much to Karen or her mother either (it seems).*

*I spoke to leasing office and they said under circumstances I can terminate lease and pay rent until they find a new occupant. Haven’t given much thought here. Mind races when I have to face this possible reality.*

*I think I’ll be fine from a financial standpoint. Have been living frugally and saved for a while.*

---

**OOP Replying to a very long comment**

*I feel like I'll be writing it on notes.app, as I have begun jotting down my thoughts since yesterday. But anyhow, since you've put in so much effort writing this comment, let me reciprocate by replying to your comment,*

>Tell me though, what was the first thing that came to your mind when you discovered your girlfriend's strange behavior?

*The way she ignored my question when we were in bed and I enquired about her orange bra, it triggered some suspicion. When I saw our common area, those stacks of undies seemed too odd. Isn't it weird when some items in your apartment have suddenly accrues without you even not having told about it? I won't deny that the thought of her cheating on me occurred to me (but only for a brief moment), but she did have terrible bleeding issues mid last year, so I thought maybe she got rid off her stale inner wear. But yeah, the though of her selling it online never occurred to me.*

>Cheating didn't come to mind?

*It did, for a very brief moment. But then I said to myself - her and cheating? Impossible. She isn't even staying late at work. In fact our sex life used to be great after we moved-in. As there were no distractions from annoying roommates when we were over each other's place. I just ruled out cheating. What I was worried was if there was indeed something, how offensive would it be to ask her, ""Hey, I noticed your collection of blah blah and blah blah is losing count ... what's going on?"". At least that's how I wanted to ask her, for what happened to her pair of orange undies.*

>If it hadn't been the strange occurrence with underwear, you wouldn't have suspected anything? You never felt anything was amiss. Some change in behavior, attitude, mannerism? Does she go out often without you? When she does what does she say she is going to do? Going to the gym? Hang out with friends? Does she stay out late often? Does she spend the night elsewhere like at parents, siblings, or friend's frequently? How often do you spend the evening and night together? How often do you eat dinner together? Do you (did you) have much of a domesticated life like coming home, making dinner, eating dinner together, hanging out and going to bed? Did you go to the grocery store together? I mean a normal life of a couple together?

*No, I would have never known if it wasn't for that strange occurrence. Nothing was amiss. She came back home during her regular hours. Sometimes after work, if we weren't watching Netflix, or doing anything else, we would go out together to a restaurant or probably hangout with friend from college (most of us stay nearby). She doesn't have a car (or at least I've advised her not to get a new car and put that money towards her student loans instead), so I drive her around or she takes mine. Subaru being stick shift, she rather prefers Uber or Lyft when I'm not around. I think same goes with her girlfriends - one of them usually picks her or drops her off when they used to hang out together. She spends nights at Karen and her newborn. That happens probably one weekend every few weeks. I can say one thing - our life was pretty domesticated. We had great time in bed though. Groceries, sometimes we used to go together, the other times split our responsibilities if one of us didn't want to vacuum and clean our apartment (most likely that would have been myself). Our life was pretty normal. We fought, but that was about her reluctance to not meet my friends or probably when I mixed up stuff in kitchen or had the habit to leave leftover on dinner table instead of deep freezing it. These were the topics of our quirky quarrels. The only major fight we had was when I let a friend from hs (a pretty good friend of m growing up) stay over at our place for few days, since he was looking for jobs and trying to move to this city. She felt that my friend should have never overstayed at our place (a week instead of 3 days). She felt a good friendship isn't a strong reason enough for someone to overstay with a couple.*

>3. Does she have a higher sex drive than you?

*Oh yeah, she does.*

*Honestly, none of my friends had those flirty vibes when they were around her. I trust my friends and at least I thought I trusted her.*

Sometimes my brain doesn't work as fast as my mouth does and I say things that I dont realise are hurtful or say things that I dont think mean anything but they actually do.

For example, today a friend paid for coffee because they hadn't had the opportunity to pay in a while and I jokingly said ""because you're always late"". To me I thought it was funny as this person is never late ever im the one who's late, I didnt think anything more of it than that. I said this in front of other people and as a result my friend feels humiliated.

I feel awful, I dislike upsetting people anywqy but especially when Its a completely innocent mistake but now I can't drop it. I have this anxiety that now this friend will never forgive me and my brain spirals.

Im also not very good at remembering things and when I forget things that are important I do the same thing and I can't drop it. Even if its something like I forgot to take the washing out of the machine I will be so frustrated and upset with myself that I work myself up into a mess.

The guilt mainly comes when I impact other people not myself but its still there.

Does anyone have any advice on how to accept I made a mistake and move on without going round in circles in my head? ",1,1761054116.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

I’m looking for a no-frills space to work 9-5. I’m on calls 20 - 25 hours a week which is why most coworking arrangements don’t work for me. I also really don’t need much — I’d work in a closet as long as it has good internet.

Private offices in town are expensive — I’m paying by for this out of pocket so hoping for something that comes in under $200 per month. 

Ideally the space would be in Black Mountain, Swannanoa, or East Asheville, but I’m willing to drive within reason for the right arrangement.

While this tastes pretty good it seems to still have too much of a chocolate milk taste and very little of the coffee/espresso taste that comes through at the actual scooters store version.

Final year student here. Like many of you, I've been spending my nights scrolling through LinkedIn, sending out resumes, going for interviews which mostly ghost or take too long to reply. The job market feels brutal right now, and honestly, it’s been pretty demoralizing.

Before the brutal reality of the job market, I was juggling my FYP and other group projects felt like drowning in Google Drive folders. You know the drill: FYP\_Report\_final.docx, FYP\_Report\_final\_edited\_v2.docx, . It was a mess.

In our double room hall 2, we set out to solve this problem. We spent countless late nights in our hall room, fueled by canteen coffee, coding and trying to solve the very problem we faced.

We built [Haxiom ](https://app.haxiom.io/)to keep all our project docs and notes organized, so no more ""FYP\_Report\_FINAL\_USE\_THIS\_ONE.docx"". It keeps all your project notes and docs organized, perfect for FYPs or group work.  
You can even **publish your projects as a clean webpage** — no hosting fees, no setup fees.  
And if you’re into code, it **syncs with GitHub** too.

I'll be honest, this really was a NTU Hall- born project. Truth is, we're just super proud of what we built and want to show it off and get real feedback. There isnt a payment option so im not trying to draw money, especially from broke Uni students HAHAHA

It’s completely free to use. We’re just starting out and would honestly love to hear what you guys think. Does it look useful? Is it confusing?

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I buy work snacks, lunches, and drinks in bulk and bring them in weekly. My corporate office doesn't provide free snacks and we dont have a cafeteria so keeping easy, healthy snacks and lunches readily available helps lessen the mental load of meal prepping/remembering lunches/spending money going out. 

I have back-up outfits hanging in the car. An extra blazer, extra shoes, a spare shirt. One morning we were running late, and I got to daycare realizing I still had muddy flip flops on from our walk with the dog that morning. Thank God I had an extra pair of work shoes in the car. 

I have a toiletries drawer in my desk-- hair supplies (I have wild curly hair that sometimes needs taming depending on the circumstance), toothbrush toothpaste, period products, deodorant, perfume, lotion, hand sanitizer, extra makeup. 

Since basically outfitting myself with backups, Ive cut  my stress down and also cut the panic. Didn't have time to do my hair at home? Thats okay, I have stuff in office. Need to change after work? Covered. 

I also pack all of my daughter's bags and lay out everything we need for the morning the night before. Clothes, socks, shoes, hair ties, brush, toothbrush, etc.

⸻

I don’t even know why I’m writing this. Maybe to make sense of it, or just so someone knows where to start looking.
Today was normal. Completely, painfully normal.

I woke up around nine, made coffee, answered work emails, and never left the house. Not once. I even remember thinking it was kind of nice — a full day without interacting with anyone. I was in and out of my closet all day. Pulled out a sweater in the morning, shoved laundry in before lunch, changed into a different shirt for a call. I must’ve opened that door a dozen times. It never creaked. It never stuck. It was just a door.

By the time I finished dinner, I was too tired to think. I took a shower, left the bathroom light on, and went to grab my pajamas. The closet was half-open — I remember that — and I reached in without thinking. My hand brushed something cold.
Not fabric. Not hangers. Skin.

There was a man standing inside.

He filled the entire closet, about six feet tall, skin too pale — like it hadn’t seen light in years. His eyes were sewn shut with black thread, thick and uneven, like whoever did it didn’t care if it hurt. His lips weren’t sealed with stitches. They were fused. The skin had grown over itself until his mouth disappeared.

For a second, we just stood there. Then I screamed.

That’s when he inhaled. It sounded wrong — a harsh, wet intake through his nose, too deep, too desperate. His chest expanded, and I swear I heard something tear. The skin around his mouth split open from the force, peeling into a grin he wasn’t supposed to have.

And then he screamed back.

It wasn’t a voice. It was a frequency. A high, metallic ringing that pierced the room. It felt like it was inside my head, vibrating behind my eyes. I dropped to the floor, hands over my ears, but it didn’t stop — not until I crawled backward and slammed the door.

I ran. No shoes. No phone charger. Just my keys. I didn’t even lock the apartment. I drove until I found a motel by the highway, begged for a room, and sat on the floor for an hour before I could breathe again.

When I finally calmed down, I started writing this. I thought if I wrote it out, I could make sense of it. Because I never left my home. I never heard a door open.
How did he get in my closet?

…wait.

I hear a hinge.
A door, slow—
creaking open.

Upper torso feeling constricted. While waiting for DR appointment I basically ate mushy food and seemed to improve. Lapsed with a snack of walnuts and immediately felt all the above symptoms. Anyway, weeks later an endoscopy found inflammation, esophagitis, gastritis and a hiatal hernia. They also took biopsy samples. Have an 8 week course of tablets, was advised to take gaviscon before bed and given a lifestyle leaflet. 

Interested in hearing advice from others with a similar journey. Could the lung/chest infections be linked to the hernia? As well as neck/shoulder pain? I now stop eating 2-3 hours before bed, sit up straight while eating (and always with a drink) and trying to avoid things I know trigger my symptoms like coffee, nuts, onions, curries, crisps, white bread, junk food but how stringent do I need to be with all the diet advice? Practically everything I like I can't have! But if I manage to avoid the discomfort maybe I can just be more sensible with my diet, and have the occasional treat. Or is there a risk for esophageal cancer further down the line? I also have asthma and scoliosis. I'm 49 male.",1,1761053269.0,HiatalHernia,0,1.0,False
1occy94,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1occy94/should_i_reach_out/,Should I reach out,"On Sunday morning at 9:30am, I went on a first date with a guy that I met on Coffee Meets Bagel. I thought the date went pretty okay, like I was happy afterwards, you know, I was looking forward to hearing from him. I didn’t want to reach out because I don’t want to sit here and chase him, you know, that’s what I’ve been told to do.

By nighttime, I hadn’t heard from him and I knew something was wrong. I was crying. I was like, okay, I guess he’s ghosting me, probably. Maybe he didn’t like me, maybe he wasn’t physically attracted to me, or maybe I did or said something wrong. But it was a bit weird that I hadn’t heard from him.

I tried to rationalize it—he told me he had lunch with his mom at 12:30pm and a contractor coming over later. Maybe he’s busy and will follow up in the morning. Morning comes, I still don’t hear from him. I’m feeling sad, crying, wondering if I should reach out.

Eventually, by 1:50pm, he reaches out. He basically says he didn’t feel a connection. He says I seem nice and he hopes I find my person. He said it was nice meeting me. I responded, “Thank you for letting me know. I had a really nice time. Good luck with everything.” And he hearted the message.

During the date, I was really nervous. It was super early for me. I wasn’t really hungry, so I barely touched my food. He pointed it out, but I was just nervous. It was hard for me to maintain eye contact; I’m really shy and introverted. On his profile, he says he’s introverted, nerdy, and takes time to open up, so maybe he misread that I didn’t like him.

This is the first time I haven’t gotten a second date with a guy I actually liked. I really took time to do my hair and makeup. I don’t know if it’s because we’re the same height, or if he’s just not physically attracted to me, or what.

I’m wondering if I should send him a message just to follow up, because I don’t want to miss out if it was just him thinking I didn’t like him.

1occxze,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1occxze,What is this in my coffee mug??,"I was drinking my coffee cup, and took the lid off to let it cool more quickly. When I took a sip, I saw these balls along the edge. I was desperate for coffee, so I just drank from the other side of the mug. Gross, I know, but I’m an addict; what do you want from me?Then I took another sip and saw some in the bottom as well. I slowly poured it out and saw all of these sitting in the bottom of the mug. What could they possibly be?

Some possibly necessary background information: I live in the United States, and I have no idea what goes into the coffee. My girlfriend makes it for me in the mornings. My best guess is coffee and lactose free milk. Occasionally, she will use creamer, but it didn’t taste that sweet today.  And there is a 0.1% chance she is trying to kill me. I would estimate that closer to 0.0%. Despite how crazy I drive myself, for some reason, she really loves me, and I’m pretty sure she didn’t do this to kill me. I think.  Please help, I am wavering back-and-forth between successfully, blocking it out of my mind and on the verge of throwing up every five seconds.  I picked up a McDonald’s, sugar-free iced coffee in hopes that all of the preservatives that are in it will successfully kill whatever I have involved in my desperation, but McDonald’s coffee only last for so long before it’s gone, hopefully unlike me.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1occw39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1occw39/advise_needed_in_a_messy_family_situation/,Advise needed in a messy family situation,"I have been thinking of posting on Reddit to ask for advice for few weeks now and finally got the courage to, as I do not have a friend group or any other type of support group I could ask for advice. 

I need advise on what to do in this messy situation I’m in, so let me explain and give some background:

I(20F) live with my mother on the other side of the country as all our other relatives. A month ago my cousins (dads side) mother came to visit my city and met up for coffee with my mother and told her my grandma has been acting weird lately and “crazy” in her words, which doesn’t surprise me. Both of my grandparents are getting old and have had serious health issues in the last few years. 
So I have been wanting to visit them for years now, but there is a huge problem with that. 

My grandparents are from my dad’s side and so are most of our other relatives. 
My mother and dad (who I don’t call my dad but will to keep this post as clear as possible) were born in the same town in the very north of my country, the town is very small and rural. My parents started dating as teens and in their late twenties moved to the city me and my mom currently live in, to study and work. They were engaged and In early thirties they had me, during the pregnancy my mother found out my dad was cheating on her and wanted to break up. My father manipulated her and quit his job, making her the sole provider for the family where now she couldn’t just throw him out. 
When I turned 2 that’s when my mom finally left him and we moved to the house we still currently live in, by then my dad had already a new family and a child on the way (who he also abandoned). 

They got shared custody of me, with me visiting my dad on the every other weekend. 
Those weekends weren’t fun, as long as I remember he was a serious alcoholic. Drinking constantly and passing out every time I was with him. He was (and is) serious manipulator, narcissistic, liar and abuser both verbally and physically. He didn’t feed me or buy me necessaries, I didn’t even have a proper bed at his place. Only things he would buy was to bribe me or a soda to drink when he made me wait outside the alcohol store. 
I never told my mother and was also very good at hiding things and had been manipulated, that was until an incident with the police and social workers when I was around 8 years old. Only thing done at the time was a 2 month restraining order. After that I was legally required to still visit him, even tho my mother tried to get full custody. 

Things continued the same for years until he moved back to hometown to live off of his parents money when I was 13. Which meant I only met him during summer breaks, which happened only 2 times until I turned 15 and had legal say on visiting. That is when I cut him off completely and that is the last time I’ve also seen my grandparents or other relatives. 
When that happened I sent him a long message explaining why I was cutting him off and why I couldn’t forgive him. 
He still to this day has never said sorry and doesn’t think he has done anything wrong and me and my mother both know he has made up some ridiculous lies as to why I don’t want to see him anymore and told them to his parents. 
While his parents are somewhat aware of his actions I doubt they know the full real story. Grandpa knows because he was there when the police case happened, and grandma knows because I sent her screenshots of the emails (insults and threats) my dad sent me and my mother after I cut him off. 

Now to where I need serious advice, I really want to see my grandparents as I fear my time is running out but the problem is my dad. My grandma is a serious gossip and will somehow tell him even if she didn’t mean to, and there is just no way he wouldn’t find out somehow that I was coming to visit. And I am seriously afraid of what he might do if he saw me, and frankly I just don’t want to see him. 
This visit cannot be unannounced, because there is nowhere to stay other than relatives houses and neither me or my mother have a car or a license. When I say the town is in the middle of nowhere, it really is, no public transport etc. 

One could ask: 
-Why can’t you stay with your mother’s parents? My mother’s parents both died when she was young, thus my dad’s mother became a mother figure for her too and they still call occasionally. 
-Why don’t you just call? It isn’t the same, and neither of my grandparents are good with technology. 
-Why don’t they come to your city? They’re old and sick, never left their town and it just wouldn’t be fair on them. 

I have also been thinking of writing them a letter, with my side of the story and why I haven’t been in contact with my dad. However I don’t know if that would be a good idea, as I don’t want to upset them and possibly cause health complications (grandpa has history of heart attack). 

So, what should I do in this situation? How can I visit them, should I write them a letter (and what should I say or include) or should I just accept that I won’t be seeing them anymore? 
Any advice or suggestions would be hugely appreciated, thank you. 

(Ps. I am sorry this is so long, I tried to make it as short as possible while still giving all the context, English also isn’t my first language so some things might not make sense)

1occtf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/businessanalysis/comments/1occtf0/new_ba_advice_think_of_bad_bas_like_swiss_coffee/,New BA Advice: Think of bad BA’s like Swiss coffee beans,"One the reasons I posted yesterday, was because I got lots of messages from people over the weekend, saying they have just finished their studies, and want to move into the BA profession, and asking how can I help them. It made me realise how fortunate I am to be in this role, sadly - there are some people who don’t appreciate how challenging the job it actually is to move into, and seem to like to discredit genuine help, on the assumption it’s possibly AI generated, and AI can do everything, including coaching, mentor and offering guidance. 

Well there are some things AI can’t do, and I’ll highlight them below, and it’s going to be a bitter pill to swallow for some, who think they know it all. 

Something I have learned about BA roles over the years, which you wont learn about in the BABOK handbook, or through a course, or from AI, is the different types of people you often come across, actually doing the role. Generally speaking, most are brilliant. They come from many diverse backgrounds, some highly educated from prestigious universities, some with real world lived experience. All relevant, and none more than others. If you fall anywhere within this set of people; you are capable of being a business analyst. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. 

Sometimes, however; most commonly of those with university degrees - which have joined an organisation through a grad scheme, people often ended up “falling” into the BA role after a rotation. The vast majority of these people love the job, find it challenging and rewarding, are really good at the job because they are inquisitive, and go on to be successful, however; there is a small subset of people who “fall” into the role but don’t enjoy the job, usually because they don’t have the ability to push themselves out their comfort zone and either a) try and fully understand the nuance or purpose of the role, or b) look for something more aligned with what they actually want out of their career. 

Now here’s a little secret that I recon a lot people who fall into this very small subset don’t actually know - because a lot of them actually think they are great at their job, when in reality; they aren’t. These are the type of people which think SOAP is only something you wash with, constantly talk about “circling back”, whilst obsessing over “synergies” to drive change, whilst also refusing to use FigJam, because Miro is simply “better”. This ethos actually applies well beyond the BA role, into many other professions, it’s the commonly referred to as Dunning-Kruger effect, but it’s very prevalent with the BA role because of how complex and abstract the role is - and as a result people often give up when trying excel in the role. Now, here’s the hard bitter truth. Organisations don’t really care when people give up, they don’t fire this type of dead weight who aren’t interested in excelling. Organisation often claim tax credits just for employing staff, especially for taking on grads from universities If they go into R&D roles; which quite often the BA role falls under. Often a BA’s salary can even be classed as what’s called capital expenditure - meaning their salaries can be treated as part of the cost of the system they are building, not a normal operational expense, meaning the salary of a BA could showing on a companies annual returns as 1/10th of what it actually is (which is great for those big public multinationals when it comes to the annual returns).

As i’m sure you can imagine, these people who think they know it all, but don’t care enough to appreciate the nuance; can be a nightmare to work with. Usually always because they are crap at their job. They cant manage their own work, and they end up managing other people - and the worst of it is, they actually often think this is because they are great at their job. And thats not to discredit the good managers, there are some great managers out there (myself included 😉); but you get a very small subset of individuals in the BA role, who; because they are miserable, and crap at their job, try to make everyone else’s job miserable also - and sadly, they are usually managers. A good management consultant, or business analyst, really doesn’t need a manager at-all, they need a mentor or a coach to guide them. To help them build networks, and relationships. This is something ChatGPT cant do. ChatGPT can do just about everything else, including an engineers job, your managers job, and your job. But, when you are looking for your first job as a BA, ask for a mentor or a coach, utilise them fully, and build relationships AI won’t do this for you, it can’t take it from you, and it will be the difference between success and failure in your career. However, be prepared to have to deal with sloppy managers from time to time, there are no shortages of them out there. I tend to think of these people like Swiss coffee beans, good for Starbuck’s returns, but irrelevant to baristas, and terrible for customers. 

Good coffee comes from Columbia. 
Bad management consultants become management.
Good management consultant coach and mentor others. 

Possible AI Prompt Used: “Hey ChatGPT, can you explain why there are idiots in the BA role, oh and also; big me up for helping people learn about the job, whilst having a dig at bad management consultants, talk about coffee beans, Starbucks and transfer pricing too”

Looking for a gang that actually enjoys *riding for the vibe* — not speed, not stunts, just those peaceful late-night spins when Bangalore finally shuts up and the roads are empty.

The idea’s simple:  
Meet at a decided spot → ride to another point → grab a smoke / chai / coffee → talk nonsense for a bit → head back home before the city wakes up.

No drama, no race — just some night air, calm roads, and a few like-minded weirdos on two wheels.

I stay near **Indiranagar** and my office’s near **HSR**, so anything around that belt works great.

If not, screw it — let’s make our own.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

I also like Asian women too please message me also! 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one!

My business has taken severe hits in the marketplace, first from global warming and now exacerbated by tariffs. My margins, which once supported my family, are very very tight. I don't have employees, I'm a one-man shop for local groceries and cafes. My business is really too small to sell, and my equipment is largely outdated. I have an adult special needs son and my wife is disabled for the last 12 years or so. I am good with the Fed, but I owe 3 years of state taxes and two years of local taxes, and amazingly they have not come after me yet. I'm a two-year cancer survivor, and the loss of capacity for surgery etc sure didn't help. I own a mortgaged house, my credit debts are reasonable, and I have no burden except taxes and the emotional burden of trying to keep my property intact for my son, and my concern that I don't want my wife to have the hardship of moving with her issues. I don't have a plan of action about this, I just joined the subreddit and I'm reading existing posts, but this is a flurry of special circumstances and a poster who's clueless around this problem.

1occr3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1occr3h/adhd_meds_alcohol_and_sleep/,"ADHD meds, alcohol, and sleep","I figure my peers may be able to provide some insight on this one. I was diagnosed with ADHD a couple years ago at 50. I decided to give meds a try, and the first one, Strattera, made me feel like I was having a heart attack. Now, a year later I have some work changes that I thought giving it another go could help with. Doc gave me 10mg extended release Adderall. From what I understand that is a pretty low dose. It seems to help with my concentration, a bit, but nothing earth shattering. I could probably get a similar effect by drinking a couple more cups of coffee during the day, but my gut wouldn't like that. The weight loss side effect is a nice little bonus though.

Anyway, the last couple months my sleep has been shit if I have a drink after work. Yesterday I had a cocktail (Negroni, yum) and a beer before dinner. As I lay in bed this morning from 2-4am, wide awake it struck me. Could the Adderall and alcohol combination have some sort of multiplier effect? Is that why I sleep like shit? I don't take Adderall on the weekends, and if I drink I still don't sleep great, which is I am sure due to my age and totally bullshit. Having a drink on days I take Adderall translates to an almost sleepless night though.

Curious if anyone can confirm this. I feel pretty dumb for not making the connection earlier.",4,1761052771.0,GenX,18,0.83,False

On a typical day, One person is making all drinks for all mobile app orders, doordashes, and cafe. One. And it’s not like Dunkin where they push a button and steamed milk comes out instantly. We are actively handcrafting beverages. The espresso machines don’t always pull good shots, so we dump bad shots and wait another 20 seconds to pull new ones. We also have a prioritization system that, theoretically, prints cafe tickets first, but it’s still a very hit or miss system, and we may still have 5 drinks ahead of yours to make in the cafe. We also sequence beverages, so if we stop making your drink and move on to another, we’re not ignoring your order. We’re just making 3 drinks at once, pausing when milk is steaming or a frapp is blending. Please be patient and understand that we are a coffee house being pushed to be a fast food restaurant (or maybe vice versa?)

⸻

I don’t even know why I’m writing this. Maybe to make sense of it, or just so someone knows where to start looking.
Today was normal. Completely, painfully normal.

I woke up around nine, made coffee, answered work emails, and never left the house. Not once. I even remember thinking it was kind of nice — a full day without interacting with anyone. I was in and out of my closet all day. Pulled out a sweater in the morning, shoved laundry in before lunch, changed into a different shirt for a call. I must’ve opened that door a dozen times. It never creaked. It never stuck. It was just a door.

By the time I finished dinner, I was too tired to think. I took a shower, left the bathroom light on, and went to grab my pajamas. The closet was half-open — I remember that — and I reached in without thinking. My hand brushed something cold.
Not fabric. Not hangers. Skin.

There was a man standing inside.

He filled the entire closet, about six feet tall, skin too pale — like it hadn’t seen light in years. His eyes were sewn shut with black thread, thick and uneven, like whoever did it didn’t care if it hurt. His lips weren’t sealed with stitches. They were fused. The skin had grown over itself until his mouth disappeared.

For a second, we just stood there. Then I screamed.

That’s when he inhaled. It sounded wrong — a harsh, wet intake through his nose, too deep, too desperate. His chest expanded, and I swear I heard something tear. The skin around his mouth split open from the force, peeling into a grin he wasn’t supposed to have.

And then he screamed back.

It wasn’t a voice. It was a frequency. A high, metallic ringing that pierced the room. It felt like it was inside my head, vibrating behind my eyes. I dropped to the floor, hands over my ears, but it didn’t stop — not until I crawled backward and slammed the door.

I ran. No shoes. No phone charger. Just my keys. I didn’t even lock the apartment. I drove until I found a motel by the highway, begged for a room, and sat on the floor for an hour before I could breathe again.

When I finally calmed down, I started writing this. I thought if I wrote it out, I could make sense of it. Because I never left my home. I never heard a door open.
How did he get in my closet?

…wait.

I hear a door opening.

1occnm1,https://i.redd.it/vz7j3y2btgwf1.jpeg,Cat has worsened behavior after moving,"My now husband and I have two cats and moved homes a couple of months ago. Even though we just got married this year, our cats have been living together for the past 4 years. They would get along ok, but the cat that was mine before we met (black cat) has a habit of picking on the tabby cat once in a while. 

Since we moved, the black cat has developed some bad behaviors and we are almost at our wits end. Whenever we are in the kitchen, he will not leave us alone. I’m talking like he will stick his head into our space and try to take whatever we are eating. Even if we push him away or take him off the counter, he will repeatedly keep jumping up over and over again and nothing deters him.

 We already put him in another room during dinner, but now he’s doing this even when we’re just making coffee and spills the coffee if we look away for a second. He has never been this bad before. We literally cant do anything in the kitchen without him constantly sticking his head into it.

Do you have any advice on what is causing this and how to change this behavior? I don’t want to have to lock him away 10 times a day.

1occnfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1occnfh/debugging_love_chapter_1/,Debugging Love (Chapter 1),"My name is Noah Blanchard. I’ve been going to Fifth & Brew Café every morning for the past nine months. That’s two hundred and seventy-three consecutive visits, not counting the one day I tried making my own coffee and nearly burned down my apartment. So yes, it’s safe to say I’m a regular.

It’s not because their coffee is extraordinary. It’s good — don’t get me wrong — but it’s not “sell your soul to the espresso machine” good. No, the reason I keep coming back is because of her… Rosie Martinez.

The girl with the honey-brown eyes, the kind that sparkle like they’re always in on a joke you don’t know yet. The girl who somehow makes teasing me a full-contact sport. She’s got this beautiful, black, long curly hair that’s always tied up in a messy bun, and a smile that could probably crash servers if it were uploaded to the internet.

I’ve tried not to like her. Really, I have. I’m not great at the whole “liking people” thing. Feelings are like software dependencies — messy, unpredictable, and usually breaking something else in the process.

“Morning, Blanchard,” she says the second I step into the café, the bell above the door chiming. Her tone drips with playful familiarity.

Only she calls me by my last name. Everyone else uses “Noah.” But Rosie, she says Blanchard like it’s some inside joke we’ve been sharing for years.

“Hey, uh, morning,” I mumble, adjusting my glasses. I always feel like my arms don’t know what to do around her — too long, too awkward. It’s like they’re controlled by a nervous raccoon.

She grins, leaning against the counter. “The usual? Or are we feeling adventurous today?”

I open my mouth, then close it again. Words. Remember those?

“Uh… usual’s fine,” I finally manage, trying to sound casual. I’m pretty sure I failed.

She laughs softly — not mocking, more like she actually finds me amusing. “One vanilla latte with extra foam for Mr. Reliable coming right up.”

Her teasing should annoy me. Instead, it does something weird to my chest — like static electricity. I shift awkwardly as she starts the espresso machine, humming some tune I don’t recognize.

Fifth & Brew is busy this time of morning, full of people who look far more competent at life than me. Business folks in suits, college students typing like their GPA depends on their caffeine intake — which, in fairness, it probably does.

I retreat to my usual spot by the window, pretending to check emails on my phone, though I’m mostly watching Rosie move around the counter. She’s graceful in that chaotic, caffeinated way — like she’s permanently synced to the café’s rhythm.

I scroll through a few work messages from my team:

 Ben: “Hey Noah, can you check the new build? The login flow is throwing a 500 error.”

 Maya: “Please tell me the bug fix didn’t break the payment system again.”

If it wasn’t obvious from those messages I work as a software engineer at a mid-sized tech company downtown. The job’s fine — quiet, predictable, logical. Unlike Rosie. She’s chaos incarnate. Beautiful, unpredictable chaos.

“Here you go, Blanchard.” Her voice cuts through my internal monologue as she sets the cup in front of me, the foam shaped into a tiny heart.

A heart!?
 Oh god. Did she—?
 No, that’s probably just how she does foam. Random coincidence.

I glance up, and she’s smirking. “You gonna drink that or just stare at it?”

“I, uh… yeah.” I take a sip too fast and burn my tongue. Smooth. Real smooth.

Her grin widens. “You okay there, hotshot?”

“Yep,” I say, voice cracking like a teenager. “Perfectly fine. No injuries here.”

She laughs — a genuine, bright laugh that makes my stomach flip. I love that sound. It’s ridiculous how much I love that sound.

I watch her go back to the counter, chatting with another customer, and sigh. If socializing were a programming language, I’d still be writing in BASIC while she’s fluent in everything from JavaScript to flirtation.



By the time I get to work, I’ve already replayed our brief exchange a dozen times in my head, overanalyzing every word like it’s a line of buggy code.

My coworker Ben swivels in his chair as I sit down. “Morning, Noah. You look… happy? Did the coffee shop girl finally smile at you?”

I freeze mid-sip. “What? No! I mean— she always smiles. It’s customer service. It’s in the job description.”

He smirks. “Right. Sure. And you’ve been coding on weekends because you love JavaScript.”

I glare at him. “Don’t bring JavaScript into this.”

Ben laughs and turns back to his monitor, clearly enjoying himself too much. He’s been trying to get me to “make a move” for months, as if I can just walk up to Rosie and say something suave like, ‘Hey, wanna compile our love into a long-term relationship?’

Yeah, no. Not happening.

Work drags on — endless debugging, meetings, and too much coffee. By the end of the day, I’m fried. As I pack up, my phone buzzes with a notification. A message from Ben:

 Ben: “Are you going tomorrow morning?”

 Me: “To work?”

 Ben: “No, genius. To the café. You can’t go a day without seeing her.”

I stare at the screen. He’s not wrong.



The next morning, I return to Fifth & Brew like clockwork. Rosie spots me the moment I walk in.

“Well, if it isn’t my favorite caffeine addict,” she says. “Guessing you want your usual?”

I hesitate. “Actually… maybe I’ll try something new today.”

Her eyebrows lift. “Oh? Look who’s living dangerously.”

I scan the menu like it’s written in hieroglyphics. “Uh… maybe a macchiato?”

She grins. “Bold choice, Blanchard. I’m proud of you.”

I don’t know why her approval makes me feel like I just got promoted, but it does.

She slides the cup to me a few minutes later, steam curling between us. “Here you go. For bravery in the face of foam.”

“Thanks,” I mutter, smiling awkwardly.

Rosie leans on the counter, chin propped in her hand. “So, what do you actually do when you’re not drinking coffee and blushing at baristas?”

My brain short-circuits. “I—uh—work with computers.”

She smirks. “Really? I never would’ve guessed, Mr. Hoodie-and-glasses.”

“Yeah, shocking, right?” I say, the sarcasm slipping out before I can stop it.

She laughs, delighted. “Ooh, a sense of humor. I knew it was buried under all that awkwardness somewhere.”

I grin, embarrassed but weirdly pleased. “It’s a rare bug. Only appears with caffeine.”

“Well,” she says, eyes twinkling, “guess I’ll have to keep supplying the caffeine.”

That’s when she winks.
 And I swear, my heart forgot how to function.



That night, I couldn't stop thinking about her. Every smile, every quip, every little tilt of her head plays on repeat. I tell myself it’s nothing — just harmless attraction. Except it’s not harmless, not anymore.

I want to know her favorite song.
 I want to know what she does when she’s not behind the counter.
 I want to make her laugh again — not just as the shy guy who orders coffee, but as someone she actually knows.

Maybe tomorrow, I’ll say something different. Something real.

Or maybe I’ll just burn my tongue again.
 Either way, I’ll be back.

I used to be a complete mess. After I got my current job, my manager told me something that completely changed my perspective. Since then, my confidence in interviews has skyrocketed, all thanks to a simple shift in my mindset.

He told me to always remember that you're just talking to people. That's it. They're not gods, and they're not there to break you. They are normal human beings, just like you, trying to find the right person for their team. Sure, you might find some of them have big job titles or work at well-known companies, but in the end, they're still just a person. If you can go into the conversation with the same relaxed mindset you use when talking to your neighbor or the person who makes your coffee, you'll find your nerves will calm down on their own. Your whole presence becomes calmer and more composed.

I know it might sound ridiculously simple, but after going through dozens of interviews in my career, I never thought about it this way. This doesn't mean you shouldn't be professional, of course not, but just be relaxed and be a normal human being.

Ever since PVR took over, everything that made those multiplexes special feels ruined from the sound quality to the screens, even the food standards have dropped. Ironically, the single screens I used to avoid back then for their poor visuals and sound have now upgraded with 4K projectors and Dolby Atmos systems.

Honestly, if not for the malls, most multiplexes would probably be running at a loss.
And the most annoying part? PVR started delaying movies by about 5 minutes at former SPI theatres and over time, the ad durations will keep increasing before the movie even begins.

I really hope people start going back to single-screen theatres they now offer a much better theatrical experience. The only thing they need to work on is improving security and ensuring a comfortable environment for everyone.

I reach the corner just as the bus is pulling away, so I start sprinting after it, coffee spilling everywhere, backpack bouncing, total movie moment. The driver actually stops, opens the door, and says, Man, that was some main character energy right there.

1occ8zw,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1occ8zw/weird_fishes/,Weird Fishes,"""Welcome aboard, Terrence, me lad!"" The Captain's voice thundered out, drawing a dark look from the woman sitting in the booth behind him. His outburst had shattered the quiet atmosphere of Linda's Roadside Diner, and when she dropped her coffee cup it had shattered in much the same way. As she fussed over her scrambled eggs, I poked at my own and thought adding some coffee might be an improvement. 


I had spent my last two dollars on the plate of runny eggs. They tasted faintly of salmon, and I quietly cursed the cook for making my eggs in the same pan as the Captain's fish. He had noticed me from across the diner and come to sit in my booth. He said he saw hunger in me, and laughed heartily when I dryly pointed out where we were. 


""You'll fit right in, me boy."" The Captain's smile carried a sense of implicit brotherhood. 


He had been right, of course. I was hungry, and I was very broke. When I left home to travel the world as a vagabond, I had underestimated the amount of desperation I would face. I remember worrying that I had come across as overeager when I accepted the job offer. I would be joining his crew for a three day commercial fishing voyage, with halibut as our quarry. 


I finished my meal without saying another word as the Captain gushed about his boat, his crew, and the open ocean. 


We drove together for three hours to a dock somewhere in the northern half of Massachusetts. We thundered down the interstate, and the Captain continued to prove himself a caricature by singing shanties the whole way. There were many times I found myself fearing that the Captain's ancient Pontiac might break down and leave us stranded somewhere along I-95. I was so thankful to have arrived without incident that I had completely forgotten there were others who would be joining us. Hauling my heavy luggage, I let my eyes wander over the area. The sand here looked dull, as if the color had been muted somehow from the usual beige sands into a depressing, greyish facsimile of the color sand is meant to be. The dock, well, ramshackle would have been too kind a word. The small staircase sat askew, with handrails held together by nails plainly visible in the overcast gloom of the afternoon. The rails had been pulled away from their posts by gravity as the rest of the dock drifted out to sea. 


As we made our way up the ragged stairs, I found myself thinking that the Captain looked every bit as creaky and dilapidated as the dock. His gait was dramatically marred by a limp of the left leg, as if it were slightly shorter than his right. His right arm swung freely as he moved, while the left dangled stiffly at his side. I wondered if the Captain, like the dock, had been stretched and distorted by the force which, like the shifting tides, pulled him out to the sea. 


""Ain't she a beauty, me lad?"" The Captain breathed out the question with awe and admiration laced into his voice. 


The ship was in much better shape than the dock. It was right around 40 feet long, with clean sleek siding. The absence of any marring of the hull told me that either the Captain was incredibly vigilant in the removal of barnacles, or the barnacles had never chosen to attach themselves to the ship to begin with. The cabin was relatively spacious, painted stark white contrasting beautifully against the ocean’s surface and the grey clouds above. Cursive letters, painted in red, told me the name of the ship. ""The Minnow."" 


""I'll say."" I muttered half-heartedly. It was a beautiful ship, but I was not a man with an eye for such things. ""Your boat is certainly much nicer than your car."" 


The sound of the Captain's laughter told me my risky remark had been worth it. He left me to settle in, claiming that he had to make sure everything was ready to go. I was putting my bags away in what meager storage the ship could afford me when I heard something that made me jump. 


It was a voice, low, and slow. Deeper and more cracked than any human voice I've heard before or since. It rasped out to me from the darkest corner of the room. 


""Hi! Oh, sorry. Frog in my throat! Haha."" He cleared his throat and spoke again. This time, his voice was perfectly ordinary. ""I'm Jared. Nice to meet you."" 


Jared got up and stepped into the negligible light which seeped down into the crew's quarters. He was Asian, possibly Chinese, with jeans that looked too big for him, and a jacket to match. 


""Nice to meet you too, I'm Terrence. Terrence Howard. Not that one, though, obviously."" I kicked myself for unnecessarily clarifying that I am not Hollywood star Terrence Howard. If I was going to be spending a week at sea with these guys, I couldn't afford to make myself out to be a weirdo. 


""Pleased to make your acquaintance, Terrence Howard. I loved you in Iron Man. So, where did the Captain find you? He picked me up from outside a Home Depot."" I don't know if people know this about being homeless, but you don't get too many folks interested in your life story. I seized on the opportunity with more gusto than I probably should have, and by the end of the night, Jared and I were on track to becoming fast friends. 


Besides Jared and I, there were three others on the vessel, not including the Captain. There was John Laramie, an elderly man with a peg leg and the face of a bulldog, who would be serving as the Captain's first mate. Then there were Sasha and Alexei Novikov, Russian twins who had fled their homeland to evade service in the war against Ukraine. These two would be working with Jared and I as deckhands. We had all made our introductions, and we were tickled to find that every one of us had been vagrants before crossing paths with Captain Yorke. I joined several others in ribbing the Captain about his crew of runaways and vagabonds, and as we laughed I caught sight of the last member of the crew. 


He had stood in abject silence, never uttering a word. Instead of joining in any conversations he simply flicked his shallow, verdant eyes from person to person, as if observing us. Hoping to garner as much information about others while sharing none about himself. I made my way over to break the ice. 


""Hello, I'm Terrance Howard."" His only response to this was to raise his eyebrows, so I pushed on. ""Where are you from?"" 


He didn't reply, he simply kept his eyes locked on mine and gave an insincere smile. Something in the way he was looking at me, saying nothing, made my skin crawl. The longer we stood together in silence, the more frightened of him I became. We were adrift in the endless expanse of the Earth's oceans, surrounded on all sides by the darkness of the early morning, and yet the most terrifying part of it all was this man. This implacable statue, standing tall and silent. Staring accusation into my soul. 

""Ah, that's Jeff! He's a friendly enough fella, but completely incapable of speech, I fear. He's what they call a mute."" The Captain had appeared, as if out of thin air, directly behind me. 


The tension I had felt melted away. I kicked myself for leaping to thoughts of paranormal stowaways before considering a simple disability. I reached out to shake Jeff's hand, and was pleased when he reciprocated the gesture. His hand was rough like sandpaper against my own, and wonderfully warm against the brisk morning winds. 


The Captain excused himself from my company and made his way forward to address the crew. 


""Alright, lads. We've got a long week of hard fishing ahead."" The Captain droned out, with the last word of the sentence trailing off. ""We set out nets at first light, go get some grub and be ready when the time comes."" There was elation in the Captain's voice. I could tell that he lived for these voyages. 


Jared and I sat together at breakfast, without much of anything to talk about. We had been discussing the most recent season of ""The Masked Singer"" when the Captain flung open the door and called us all to our tasks. 


The day's work passed by in such a blur that I could hardly believe it when I first saw the moon. There was something therapeutic in the mindless labor. We had been laughing and joking amongst ourselves so much that the work had stopped feeling like work at all. That mood, unfortunately, wouldn't last. 


The Captain stood before us in the dining area that night, noticeably shorter than when we had departed. I had a hard time putting my finger on what was giving me the impression that the Captain was profoundly sorrowful, but I figured it out about halfway through his speech. Something in his face had shifted, giving way for his eyeballs to become ever so slightly larger than they had been. 


""Is the Captain sick or something? He looked kinda off today."" I mused to Jared as we lay down for the night. 


""Dunno, I didn't notice anything. Why?"" He replied. 


""I'm not sure. It's probably nothing."" I said, deciding to drop the subject. I told myself I couldn't lie awake all night thinking about things I had probably just imagined. 


The next morning, I found myself working closely with the first mate, Mr. Laramie. We had been assigned to the gutting and freezing of the previous day's catch. 


""So Mr. Laramie,"" I picked up a halibut with a particularly sad look in its dead eyes and sliced it from tip to tail, ""Where are you from?"" 


""S'best not to talk, boy. Ye'll get the guts in yer mouth."" He spat the sentence out at me, and I took the cue to shut up. 


We worked together in silence, processing the hundred or so fish which felt like thousands at the time. 


""Okay, but you can at least tell me where you're fr-"" my sentence died in my throat. A particularly full stomach had fallen from the halibut Mr. Laramie had just gutted, landing with a crash and sending a ribbon of fish intestine soaring into my mouth. The scrap of viscera landed on my tongue, leaving behind an oily, bitter film. Mr. Laramie laughed hysterically as I retched over a barrel. 



After ten minutes of scraping my tongue and gargling seawater, I was ready to return to work. 


""Y'alright now, boy?"" Mr. Laramie had softened significantly after laughing at my misfortune. 


""Yeah, I'm fine. Pass me that stomach, I want to see what the hell this thing ate."" He handed it over, and I sliced it open. I had expected a workboot, or a can of beans and another round of laughs. I had not expected a small, humanoid being with large, bulbous eyes which hung suspended from stalks protruding from where the eye socket would typically be found on a human. 


""Go fetch the cap'n."" Mr. Laramie whispered, with his face stark white in the fluorescent light of the ship's processing station. 


The Captain followed me back to the station while I tried, and failed, to explain what we'd found. When he entered the cramped room full of death and viscera, his eyes instantly locked on the tiny corpse. 


""WHAT IN THE BLUE BLAZES HAVE YE DONE? I OUGHT TO THROW THE BOTH OF YE OUT INTO THE BLOODY SEA AND LET HER HAVE HER WAY WITH YE."" The Captain had flown into a rage, with tears in his eyes and a face as red as an apple's ass. 


""Now hol' on Cap'n, it weren't the boy's fault we were ju-"" I appreciated Mr. Laramie defending me, but Captain Yorke clearly did not. He cut Laramie off mid-sentence. 


""So yer saying it was you then, are ye Mr. Laramie? Ye and ye alone killed that poor child? Twas ye who may doom us all then, aye, Mr. Laramie?"" His accent shifted in strange ways as the anger waxed and waned. 


""No! No Captain, it were the fish what did it. The boy and I found the poor thing dead in the belly of a halibut."" Mr. Laramie seemed like he might cry. I hoped he wouldn't, as I've never been able to handle the sight of an old man crying. 


The Captain's rage had died immediately once he understood what had happened. He solemnly crossed the room, and discard the body into the sea. 


""Neither of ye are to speak of this."" The Captain muttered, turning on his heel to storm out of the room. 


""What the fuck was that?"" I asked Mr. Laramie, who was clearly just as perplexed. He just stared back at me, stunned, with his jaw hanging open. 


When Jared asked me how working with the first mate had been,  I thought about telling him the truth. In the end, I decided to obey the Captain and keep it to myself. 


""It was...fine."" I said. Better to lie by omission. 


""Well you really missed out today. You know those Russian fellas? Well, they were doing this bit where they got on either end of a fish and pretended they were fu-"" Listening to the stories of the day's hijinks brought me peace enough that I fell asleep while he spoke. 


I was the first to wake the next morning, and I made my way onto the deck to enjoy the sea breeze air. I decided to walk laps around the deck, and it wasn't until the third or fourth that my foot brushed against the body. The corpse was lying flat on the deck, barely concealed between two fishing nets. I pulled the nets away, and revealed a pale face which had become bloated to an unimaginable degree. It was so severe that the features were nigh upon indiscernible, aside from his mouth.  A thin trail of water trickled from the engorged orifice,  and in desperation I turned the man onto his side. If he had drowned, then there was a chance he could be resuscitated, or at least thats what I had thought at the time. 


When I turned him, gallons of water began to rapidly force their way out through his blue lips, carrying out hundreds of tiny orbs. His skin began to visibly sag, progressing further and further until the dead man was left as nothing more than a sack of crumpled skin lying on the deck. 


The thing they don't tell you about being out at sea, is that the winds steal away the sound of your screams. I'm not sure how long I sat there in the dark, pawing at the crumpled remains and screaming for help which could not hear me. 


 I shuffled myself to the Captain's quarters in a daze. When he finally answered my pounding at his door, I could only point towards the area where I had found the body. I followed him over, stopping just short of where the body would be visible. I heard the Captain shout in horror, and he rushed off to rouse the crew. 


We all gathered for a headcount. Myself, Alexei, Sasha, Jared, and the Captain were all accounted for. That left Mr. Laramie as the only one missing. The Captain grabbed up the empty skin and shook it out in the same way one unfurls a flag. He held the remains up against the emerging morning sun, as if to confirm the identity. The light passed through the limp husk easily, causing the whole body to glow a dim orange as we stared on in silence. 


We all coped in different ways. I tried my best to find some rational explanation for what I'd seen, but there was none. I even tried the irrational ones. I found myself thinking of the Kelpie of Scottish folklore and how it would drown men on dry land. I had to shake the thoughts away, as they kept leading my mind back to the image of Mr. Laramie's distorted face. The Russians, in true form, had taken to indulging in alcoholism. Jared decided to play den mother, checking in on everybody. Jeff, who usually kept a fair bit of distance, had begun to gravitate toward the group much more strongly. We were all together in the common area when the ship lurched forward, and stopped dead. 


I stared at the decimated engine in disbelief, feeling my soul wither at the hopeless wreck before me. It had been clearly and brutally sabotaged, with fuel lines which looked more like they'd been ripped than cut. The room reeked of oil, diesel, and grinding metal. If we tried to keep it running, it would only destroy itself in the process. We had no choice but to shut it down.  The Captain reached out and put his hand on my shoulder. It was icy cold, and my shirt was left wet when he pulled back. 


""S'alright, lad. Alexei'll have us fixed up in no time. Just think of how many fish we'll catch while we wait, me boy!"" His eyes did something strange then. They seemed to move and stretch, as if trying to separate from one another. 


""Captain... are you feeling well?"" I asked, genuinely concerned. 


""Never better, me boy!"" Once again his eyeballs seemed to try and flee from each other. ""Now let's get to work!"" 


Jared and I tried to make small talk while we worked through the day, but mostly we just stood around in a daze. Our situation had grown incredibly dire, incredibly quickly.


The sun felt hot against my skin in a way I hadn't noticed before. The stench of fish, death, sweat, and rot seemed to penetrate my nostrils with unprecedented ferocity. The whole trip had been suddenly altered beyond recognition. It was impossible to believe we had been happy just a day before. 


As we went to bed that night, Jared asked the question I had been desperately trying to avoid asking myself. 


""Do you think we'll live to see dry land again?"" He sounded distant as he spoke, and I knew the question had been rhetorical. 


The next day began with a mote of hope, as Alexei and Sasha announced they had found a suitable replacement for the destroyed fuel lines. We all cheered the announcement, with the exception of Captain Yorke. He stood in the background of the celebration, with fear and surprise bursting from his eyes. 


Upon returning to our duties, it quickly became apparent that Jeff had gone missing. We all searched frantically, calling out for him and turning the ship over. Eventually we found him, wrapped up in a net and tied off to the side of the boat. Like whatever had killed him wanted to keep him close, but hidden. 


Jared and I called an emergency meeting of the remaining crew. Together, we accused the Captain, whose eyes had grown more tubular in their shape and at least twice their usual size, of being some sort of demon. It was the only thing that made sense. He was the one who had lured us all out here. He was the only person on the ship that seemed to be fucking mutating. It had to be him. 


""A demon? Listen to yerself, lad. What kind of demon would I be? What kind of demon would take a boatload o' fuckheads like you on a fishin voyage, let alone pay ye? Far as I'm concerned, neither one a ya are worth a damned dime."" I scoffed at the ridiculous rebuttal, but it quickly became apparent that Alexei and Sasha remained undecided. 


We divided the ship into two sections, fore and aft, with the Russians hunkering down in the engine room. The food and water would be kept in the middle to provide access to all parties. 

Jared was the first one who found Alexei that night. We were awoken by a massive clatter. Alexei and his brother, Sasha, had been working through the night to get us back up and running. Something had slashed Alexei viciously down his torso, spilling his guts out into his lap where he sat slumped against the engine. His mouth was moving in an attempt to speak last words, but none would come. He reminded me of one of the fish we had caught. Uselessly bumping his gums against each other in some vain attempt at one last act. We spread out and searched through the ship, but Sasha was nowhere to be found. 


By this point there were only the three of us left. Jared and I slept in shifts, and neither one of us saw any sign of Captain Yorke during the first night. The standoff lasted a few days, before we walked out onto the deck to find him with our food and water teetering on the ship's edge. 


""You can't hide from me forever, lads,"" he gently nudged our bottled water out into the waves, ""it's just us out here."" And he followed it up with the food. 


I shut the door. There was no more sense in going out if there was no supplies out there. We planned to escape via life raft, but a storm had blown in. It stayed for two days. On the second night of the storm, during my turn to take the watch, I succumbed to my exhaustion and fell asleep. 


I woke up two hours later in a panic. The storm had passed, and the sun was high in the sky. Jared was gone. I rushed out onto the deck, finding the Captain squatting over his lifeless, bloated form. I fell to my knees, buckling under the weight of sheer hopelessness. Captain Yorke turned to face me, and I saw his eyes had ballooned to ridiculous proportions, each as large as a soccer ball. They drooped down by his cheeks as the eyestalks they were mounted on failed to support the weight. The stalks themselves were grotesque, like sea sponges comprised of taut human skin. The Captain had visibly shrunken in terms of height, with his limbs growing thicker and less flexible but more powerful in a way which was horribly apparent. 


I wanted to pick myself up and flee back to the perceived safety of the room, but there was no point. I was going to have to sleep at some point. Even if he didn't come for me, I'd die to dehydration or starvation within days. My mouth had become so dry that my tongue felt like a wad of sandpaper prodding desperately for any trace of saliva. I resigned myself to death as the Captain leaped across the deck and landed on my chest. 


He held me firmly in place, distending his jaw and placing my entire head in his mouth. His icy lips locked around my neck, forming a seal. The afternoon sun bled red through the skin of his cheeks, providing just enough light to see water trickling in to the Captain's mouth. I struggled to free myself from him for five minutes which each felt like an hour. As the water level rose, I was able to smell the fact that it was not sea water. It was fresh. Drinkable. I was so desperate that I might have done it, if it hadn't been for the tiny orbs I'd felt bumping against every inch of submerged skin. My mouth was eventually covered, and the fluid had risen to just below my nose when I finally managed to break a hand free from the grasp of Captain Yorke. I flailed wildly, grabbed the first thing my hand found and pulled. 


A splash echoed across the deck as the Captain released me and began to howl in pain. I had grabbed his eyestalk, and pulled the whole thing clean off. I didn't waste my moment. I grabbed the other eye and yanked until it separated with a sickening squelch. The Captain stumbled blindly, slashing at the air with fingernails elongated into vicious claws. When he wandered too close to the edge, I delivered a kick which sent him plunging into the briny deep. I collapsed on the spot. 


I'm not sure how long I lay there drifting aimlessly through the sea. I'm pretty sure the dehydration affected my memory, as it's mostly just a blank. I do remember one night though. I'd say, maybe two days after I had killed Captain Yorke, I saw Jared's body suddenly shift, turning his head to lay against the deck. I heard water rushing out of his mouth and out toward the sea, and then, a few minutes later, I heard a tiny splash from the side of the ship. Like something very small had fallen, or jumped, down into the churning waves of the Atlantic. Then another. And another. Then ten more, and another ten after that until I had become completely convinced that there were thousands of *somethings* in the water all around. 


I was found a couple days later by a friendly fisherman who fed me and gave me water.  He even let me use his phone to get messages out to what few friends and family I have left. He said he's going to take me to his hometown to rest up before he drives me down to West Virginia. I'm going home to see my family again. I think of Jared and the others. I only just met them, and now they're dead and gone. I need to be somewhere that I'm known, no matter how bad it might be. Just a few days of rest in Innsmouth and then I'll be on my way.

1occ8o1,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1occ8o1/my_best_friend_ghosted_me_and_its_haunting_me/,My best friend ghosted me and it’s haunting me,"
I started grad school in 2017 in a relatively small program of about 25 people. I quickly befriended another girl in the program, we can call her Beth, and an immediate close friendship was established. We started meeting at coffee shops to work on assignments together, going out for drinks and dinner after class, going to eachother apartments to hangout and do homework. In a few months time Beth had become one of my closest friends who I told everything about my day to day life with dating, family issues, and she did the same. 

Our relationship evolved beyond school, to just hanging out and joining each others social circles. From this I picked up on that Beth was from an extremely privileged background, and visited her families $15 million ski home in the state we were studying. Beth was quite humble and down to earth, and while she must have realized we weren’t from the same caliber of wealth it was never an issue and she was always extremely generous in paying for things outside of my reach if we were at a bougie dinner or bar. 

The program we were doing in grad school was very technical and computer science focused, and this was not Beth’s background. She wanted to work in a more Product/Program Manager focused role after finishing, and thought this was the best route. My background was however quite matched to this, and I felt comfortable with a lot of our hands on and more technical courses and work. I helped Beth a lot when it came to schoolwork and more technical concepts. On occasion I would let her just look at my work if she was late to a deadline or needed extra help. I never thought much of this, we really felt like best friends and of course I just wanted to help her out. 

Towards the end of our program we were as close as could be. Spending nearly 6 days a week together for both school and just hanging out socially, either 1 on 1 or with other friends. She introduced me to her family, best friends, and boyfriend. I never second guessed our relationship and we rarely ever fought or had issues. We had a 5 week seminar abroad coming up and were  very excited for the experience. On the trip, I met my future ex-boyfriend. I spent a lot of time with him while abroad, falling in love and living my best life. She did express some jealousy and disappointment in me, for not spending every evening after coursework hanging out with her. I thought she would understand as she had recently entered a relationship herself, and had also in that recent past cancelled several plans with me to do stuff with him. It didn’t bother me much, but when she reacted like this I was a bit hurt and confused. 

Things went back to normal after we returned to our home city, both dating our boyfriends and hanging out as normal. The end of our graduate program was coming up and we even had a joint graduation party at my apartment with our friends and family. I really thought she would be one of my best friends for life with how close we were in these days. 

We both got professional jobs after graduating, and stayed in the same city. Beth and I were still hanging out several times a week and texting/communicating daily. 

Right before covid I was sexually assaulted and it was a very traumatic event for me. I vented about it to Beth and another close friend who I had met through her. I thought Beth’s reaction was a bit strange and non-sympathetic, almost seeming like she didn’t want to hear about this dark cloud in my life. She was still relatively supportive through this time, and then with Covid happening shortly after everything was strange so I lost sight of that issue.

Beth returned to her family during Covid so we didn’t see much of eachother even when social distancing was allowed, but we still talked and texted every day, with lots of FaceTimes. We were still extremely close, and when she came back after Covid we resumed our hanging out almost as normal. 

I decided in 2021 that I had spent a lot of time in this city and had been through a lot, and needed to change. I was in a remote position who encouraged me to move to the west coast, so I went with that. When I told Beth she was a bit quiet and cold, telling me to stay yet also sounding very uninterested. We hung out until the day before I moved, and she even hosted a dinner for me on my last night and helped me pack my car. 

This was the last time I thought of Beth as a friend. I drove off the next day, texting her and updating her pictures of my journey, and didn’t get any responses. After 3 days of driving I called her and she didn’t answer. Another couple days go by and I get a very short ‘hey sorry I’m super busy with work’ text. I replied asking how she was, and what was new. We were used to communicating daily about our lives, so I felt very anxious and stressed about this. More days went by with no reply, and I sent a more asserting message asking if we weren’t friends anymore or what the situation was. She just said she misses me and loves me and just has been busy. I thought I’d leave it for her to re-engage communication when she was ready, and she never did. 

We had plans for her to come visit my new city, which were never spoken about again. My birthday went by without a message, and I came to terms with that our friendship was fully over. 

I am still deeply confused about this to this day. I have spent a lot of time thinking about what I could have said or done to make her ghost me like this. Years have gone by at this point, without a word from her, but it still haunts me. 

Just last night I had a dream that she confronted me that I had upset her and she didn’t want to speak to me ever again. I guess that is what has inspired this Reddit post. I have had many similar dreams of this, with my mind trying to cope with this loss of friendship. I have even had a dream before where she just hugs me and tells me she is sorry, and I woke up hysterically crying. 

Part of me wonders and feels like she used me in grad school to get through the difficult technical work, and then I was too far inserted into her life for her to abandon me at graduation, so she then just took her first chance when I moved out of state. 

I sent a drunk text last year vaguely explaining my confusion about the situation and I wished she would have just told me she didn’t want to be friends anymore. That text was never replied to.

I have moved on with my life, I’m married, in another new city, with lots of great friends both old and new. My friendship with Beth still haunts me though. It puts a pit in my stomach to think about how someone I thought was my closest friend, disappeared after throwing me a goodbye dinner. 

It makes my stomach hurt even more to think about her at that dinner, and if she was just waiting in that moment to be rid of me forever. 

I’m not a perfect person, nor a perfect friend, but I thought her and I really had something genuine and we contributed a lot to each others lives. I can be awkward at times, and I’m not extremely wealthy like her other friends, but I never thought she was that type of person. 

I just don’t know how to get her out of my dreams and stop my subconscious from trying to find a resolution and reason. ",1,1761051469.0,self,0,0.67,False

1ocby2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ocby2s/my_partner_29m_and_i_27f_recently_had_a_baby_and/,My partner (29M) and I (27F) recently had a baby and I feel like he expects me to be his mom too.,"Reposted: due to missing length of relationship 

My partner and I have been together for 5 years and recently have been arguing SO much recently due to lack of sleep bc of our baby. I'm a SAHM and My partner originally agreed to watch the baby overnights while going to work. Due to me having medical health issues that pretty much make it impossible for me to get sleep even when I actually can. 

Every now and again our baby goes through a regression (like most babies). I have been waking up with him during these times to help out as I am the primary caregiver, I understand that during harder times she just wants me. But once we figure out how to get her to sleep better, we usually revert back to the original agreement. 

The baby recently started teething and is also going through a regression. I have been staying up with him and even taking her for hours during the night so he can sleep. Causing me to get even less sleep for the last 2.5 weeks. We finally figured it out and now that she's able to sleep I know he is as well. So the last 2 nights when she wakes up, I don't get up to help him. He will purposely make a show of getting up and throwing a tantrum pretty much. 

For example, one night she woke up he laid there (as to see if she would go back to sleep on her own) and when she didn't he threw his legs up in the air and slammed them down on the bed and sighed REALLY loudly. I turned around barely tapped (slapped-ish to get his attention) him on the arm and whispered for him to stop that she's just a baby. 

Now the last 2 nights I haven't been getting up and he makes a show of it to wake me up. I have still been getting up to help him. EVERY SINGLE TIME he starts an argument. Saying that we should be switching overnights or taking turns. Like he gets the first half and I get the second half. I have denied this every time and he gets more mad about it.

I take care of her 5-6 days a week by myself for 12+ hours on top of managing the household and attempting to manage my multiple health issues by myself. Half the time I don't even get to shower bc he's up my ass saying ""the baby needs me"". When he gets home from work he is supposed to watch her and take care of her until he goes to work so I can get some rest. But ever since I've healed more from having the baby (C-section), when he's watching her he asks me to literally DO EVERY SINGLE THING. For example: grab him couch pillows and blankets so he can lay on the floor next to the baby, make him breakfast lunch, dinner, coffees and lunch for work, change her diaper so he can ""go pee"", make her bottles so he can ""watch her"" instead of having to get up himself, prep her bath for her nightly bath, etc.

I feel like he is treating me like I am his mom too and I'm tired of it. He feels like I'm not doing enough and that I need to do more overnights. 

I have gotten to the point where I tell him I'm just going to break up with him, so he can see what it's like to manage a household, a baby, and himself by himself bc I feel like he's taking me for granted. All he says is ""mhm"" and ignores the comment. I have more then half a mind to just pack my shit and leave him at this point. So it can open his eyes to every thing I do for him.

Edit to add: The baby is 5.5 months old and he works 8 hour shifts but wakes up so early and comes home so late I am with her for 12 hours by myself with no help.  She is a complicated napper, so I end up not being able to nap at all during the day on top of lack of sleep at night due to my health issues. He watches her for a total of 3-4 hours before it's her bedtime. Then bedtime she does maybe 1-2 wake ups at night if she isn't going through a regression.

No we do not have any outside support. My mom believes my baby needs 1 nap a day and that I feed her too much. My pediatrician has confirmed that I do not feed her too much. So we can't trust my mom to give her the naps she needs or feed her and I'm top of that we have asked her previously to watch her ( before she's said these things) and she always said no.

His mom physically assaulted me 2 weeks before I got pregnant...that kind of speaks for itself. His dad just got back from being deployed so he wasn't even an option. They're divorced for context. So their really is no support.

TL;DR: My partner treats me like I'm his mother after having his kid when he's watching his own kid and I am seriously debating on leaving him. He wants me to do overnights with the baby as well as catering to his every whim when he's home watching the baby. I already watch her 5-6 days a week 12+ hours a day. 

Any advice? Should I actually be helping him do overnights? ",11,1761050684.0,relationships,20,0.87,False
1ocbxu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1ocbxu7/one_of_my_best_friends_ghosted_me_and_its/,One of my best friends ghosted me and it’s haunting me,"I started grad school in 2017 in a relatively small program of about 25 people. I quickly befriended another girl in the program, we can call her Beth, and an immediate close friendship was established. We started meeting at coffee shops to work on assignments together, going out for drinks and dinner after class, going to eachother apartments to hangout and do homework. In a few months time Beth had become one of my closest friends who I told everything about my day to day life with dating, family issues, and she did the same. 

Our relationship evolved beyond school, to just hanging out and joining each others social circles. From this I picked up on that Beth was from an extremely privileged background, and visited her families $15 million ski home in the state we were studying. Beth was quite humble and down to earth, and while she must have realized we weren’t from the same caliber of wealth it was never an issue and she was always extremely generous in paying for things outside of my reach if we were at a bougie dinner or bar. 

The program we were doing in grad school was very technical and computer science focused, and this was not Beth’s background. She wanted to work in a more Product/Program Manager focused role after finishing, and thought this was the best route. My background was however quite matched to this, and I felt comfortable with a lot of our hands on and more technical courses and work. I helped Beth a lot when it came to schoolwork and more technical concepts. On occasion I would let her just look at my work if she was late to a deadline or needed extra help. I never thought much of this, we really felt like best friends and of course I just wanted to help her out. 

Towards the end of our program we were as close as could be. Spending nearly 6 days a week together for both school and just hanging out socially, either 1 on 1 or with other friends. She introduced me to her family, best friends, and boyfriend. I never second guessed our relationship and we rarely ever fought or had issues. We had a 5 week seminar abroad coming up and were  very excited for the experience. On the trip, I met my future ex-boyfriend. I spent a lot of time with him while abroad, falling in love and living my best life. She did express some jealousy and disappointment in me, for not spending every evening after coursework hanging out with her. I thought she would understand as she had recently entered a relationship herself, and had also in that recent past cancelled several plans with me to do stuff with him. It didn’t bother me much, but when she reacted like this I was a bit hurt and confused. 

Things went back to normal after we returned to our home city, both dating our boyfriends and hanging out as normal. The end of our graduate program was coming up and we even had a joint graduation party at my apartment with our friends and family. I really thought she would be one of my best friends for life with how close we were in these days. 

We both got professional jobs after graduating, and stayed in the same city. Beth and I were still hanging out several times a week and texting/communicating daily. 

Right before covid I was sexually assaulted and it was a very traumatic event for me. I vented about it to Beth and another close friend who I had met through her. I thought Beth’s reaction was a bit strange and non-sympathetic, almost seeming like she didn’t want to hear about this dark cloud in my life. She was still relatively supportive through this time, and then with Covid happening shortly after everything was strange so I lost sight of that issue.

Beth returned to her family during Covid so we didn’t see much of eachother even when social distancing was allowed, but we still talked and texted every day, with lots of FaceTimes. We were still extremely close, and when she came back after Covid we resumed our hanging out almost as normal. 

I decided in 2021 that I had spent a lot of time in this city and had been through a lot, and needed to change. I was in a remote position who encouraged me to move to the west coast, so I went with that. When I told Beth she was a bit quiet and cold, telling me to stay yet also sounding very uninterested. We hung out until the day before I moved, and she even hosted a dinner for me on my last night and helped me pack my car. 

This was the last time I thought of Beth as a friend. I drove off the next day, texting her and updating her pictures of my journey, and didn’t get any responses. After 3 days of driving I called her and she didn’t answer. Another couple days go by and I get a very short ‘hey sorry I’m super busy with work’ text. I replied asking how she was, and what was new. We were used to communicating daily about our lives, so I felt very anxious and stressed about this. More days went by with no reply, and I sent a more asserting message asking if we weren’t friends anymore or what the situation was. She just said she misses me and loves me and just has been busy. I thought I’d leave it for her to re-engage communication when she was ready, and she never did. 

We had plans for her to come visit my new city, which were never spoken about again. My birthday went by without a message, and I came to terms with that our friendship was fully over. 

I am still deeply confused about this to this day. I have spent a lot of time thinking about what I could have said or done to make her ghost me like this. Years have gone by at this point, without a word from her, but it still haunts me. 

Just last night I had a dream that she confronted me that I had upset her and she didn’t want to speak to me ever again. I guess that is what has inspired this Reddit post. I have had many similar dreams of this, with my mind trying to cope with this loss of friendship. I have even had a dream before where she just hugs me and tells me she is sorry, and I woke up hysterically crying. 

Part of me wonders and feels like she used me in grad school to get through the difficult technical work, and then I was too far inserted into her life for her to abandon me at graduation, so she then just took her first chance when I moved out of state. 

I sent a drunk text last year vaguely explaining my confusion about the situation and I wished she would have just told me she didn’t want to be friends anymore. That text was never replied to.

I have moved on with my life, I’m married, in another new city, with lots of great friends both old and new. My friendship with Beth still haunts me though. It puts a pit in my stomach to think about how someone I thought was my closest friend, disappeared after throwing me a goodbye dinner. 

It makes my stomach hurt even more to think about her at that dinner, and if she was just waiting in that moment to be rid of me forever. 

I’m not a perfect person, nor a perfect friend, but I thought her and I really had something genuine and we contributed a lot to each others lives. I can be awkward at times, and I’m not extremely wealthy like her other friends, but I never thought she was that type of person. 

I just don’t know how to get her out of my dreams and stop my subconscious from trying to find a resolution and reason.",1,1761050667.0,lostafriend,1,1.0,False

It was last week, as [Venus prepared to enter Virgo](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). Sitting there, watching the [Two of Cups reversed](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb), I realized: I’d turned love into a performance review.

When [Venus transits into Virgo, something shifts](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb).

# Understanding Venus in Virgo Transit: When Love Gets Practical

[Venus moves into Virgo](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) once a year for three weeks. This [venus transit shifts energy](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) from passion to pragmatism, from [what love feels like to what love actually does](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb).

While [Venus in Leo loved through dramatic gestures](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb), Venus in Virgo loves through remembering how you take your coffee. Through researching [solutions to problems you mentioned weeks ago](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). This is practical love astrology — [the kind that changes your life](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb).

[Venus in Virgo’s energy illuminates connection mechanics ](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)— how we communicate needs, where [we compromise versus sacrifice](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). In [relationship astrology, this means examining partnership health and understanding venus placement meaning](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). This isn’t soulmate astrology — [this is **building something real with another imperfect human**](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb).

[Venus in virgo relationships ](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb')ask: Are you choosing partners [who can meet you, or choosing potential and calling it love?](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)

>

If you [examine venus sign compatibility](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) and heal [anxious attachment relationships](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb), you can [**build love that lasts**](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb).

# 1. Service vs. Sacrifice: The Venus in Virgo Lesson

While [Venus moves through Virgo](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb), the difference between serving someone and [sacrificing yourself becomes impossible to ignore](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). They feel identical, [but only one builds intimacy](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). The other builds resentment.

[True service means offering from overflow, not depletion](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). Making your [partner’s favorite meal](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) because seeing them nourished brings joy — not [because you’re terrified they’ll leave](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb).

During this transit, notice [where you’ve confused love with self-erasure](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). [Virgo Venus energy can manifest as perfectionism](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) — believing if you serve enough, you’ll finally be worthy.

When I went for [relationship tarot readings as Venus transits Virgo](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb), the [Four of Pentacles kept appearing](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) — that energy of giving while secretly keeping score. If you’re exhausted by how much you give, [you’re likely sacrificing, not serving.](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)

This week, [choose one action that genuinely makes your partner’s life easier **because it brings authentic joy**](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). Not because you should. Not because [you’re hoping they’ll finally see](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). Just because you want to.

Watch for this [transit’s shadow side: service turning into control](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). Real service honors autonomy.

You can’t pour from an empty cup. Receive as much as you give.

# 2. Communication Precision: Venus Astrology Meets Reality

[Venus in Virgo knows “I love you” means nothing if your actions](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) contradict it daily. [Mercury, Virgo’s ruling planet, governs communication](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) — so during this transit, [our patterns get examined](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb).

[Think about your last real argument](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). Was it about dishes, or about feeling invisible? While [Venus moves through Virgo](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb), we’re forced to get specific [about what we’re actually upset about](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb).

Do you say you [value honesty but withdraw into silence every conflict?](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) Do you claim you want intimacy but respond to [vulnerability with solutions instead of presence?](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)

This [energy illuminates the disconnect between stated values](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) and lived behavior, that [gap is where relationships die.](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)

Get specific about [how you communicate love](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). Not declarations — the daily [micro-communications that build trust](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). Reply to texts with presence. When your [partner shares vulnerably, put down your phone](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb).

Apologize for specific behaviors. [Venus in Virgo’s practical energy rewards](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) precision: “[I’m sorry I criticized how you loaded the dishwasher when you were trying to help](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)” creates healing. “[I’m sorry you got upset](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)” creates distance.

[Study your venus placement meaning](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). This transit asks you to refine your approach.

# 3. Deep Healing Work: Why Transformation Requires More Than Understanding

[You can’t love someone better than you’ve healed your own wounds](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). You’ll keep attracting the [same painful lesson, unavailable partners](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) who feel like home, [anxious dynamics that feel like love until you do actual healing work.](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)

You can understand [intellectually that your anxious attachment style](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) stems from childhood. You can know you[ choose emotionally unavailable partners](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) because that dynamic feels familiar.

**But** [**intellectual understanding doesn’t heal relationship patterns**](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)**. Transformation does.**

[Most content explains venus sign compatibility](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) — then leaves you repeating patterns.

As [Venus transits Virgo, conditions become perfect for **sustainable, root-level healing** that changes](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) how you show up in relationships.

**This is where** [**I had to get real with myself**](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)**.**

After that session where [I realized I’d turned love into a performance review](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb), I knew I needed [more than just understanding](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). I needed actual healing work. I [found a practitioner on coto ](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)who specialized in [relationship patterns and attachment wounds.](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)

Over several sessions, [we used the Love Destiny Spread not for predictions](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb), but to excavate where [my trust had broken and why I kept choosing emotional unavailability](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). The work wasn’t comfortable. We traced my [perfectionism back to childhood patterns](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) I’d never named. We identified where I [was repeating my parents’ dynamic without realizing it](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb).

The 11-card layout revealed:

* [**Why I kept choosing emotionally unavailable partners**](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb): The specific childhood wound [creating this attraction, and the concrete healing path](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) to break it
* [**Where my trust was broken**](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb): The [exact nervous system practices to help me feel safe in intimacy again](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)
* [**What unconscious patterns I was repeating**](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb): The relationship dynamics I watched [growing up that I was recreating on autopilot](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)
* [**How to recognize healthy love**](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb): Because I was sabotaging good [relationships precisely because they felt unfamiliar](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)
* [**My specific healing roadmap**](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb): Concrete practices, realistic timeline, and [transformation milestones tailored to my situation](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)

**What made the difference was ongoing support.**

My practitioner [didn’t just give me insights and send me on my way](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). We [worked together beyond the initial reading](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). She helped me translate [spiritual insight into daily practices I could actually implement](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). She tracked my progress as I did the work. She [adjusted the approach as I evolved and new layers emerged](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb).

She held [space for the emotional processing that real transformation requires the grief](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb), the anger, the [terror of changing patterns](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) that kept me safe even as they kept me stuck.

The [investment ranged from $97–297 depending on depth of work](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb), with ongoing support packages available. But honestly? The cost of not doing this work — [another failed relationship, another year of the same patterns, another heartbreak that could have been avoided](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) — that cost was so much higher.

That’s what [Venus in Virgo’s practical energy demands](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb): not just insight, but implementation.

I had to get brutally honest with myself: [What pattern was I most tired of repeating?](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) For me, it was choosing [emotional unavailability and calling it “mystery.” What’s yours?](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)

# 4. Embrace Imperfection: The Shadow Work Venus Demands

This transit’s [shadow side is brutal perfectionism masquerading](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) as standards.

[Venus in Virgo can turn love into performance review](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). As Venus transits Virgo, you’ll see everywhere [you’ve confused love with performance anxiety.](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)

I remember clearly: [Tuesday night pasta, he got a detail wrong about a story I’d heard before](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). Mixed up which coworker said what. [Irritation surged: *He’s not even listening.*](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)

Then I caught myself. Caught the pattern: [**collecting evidence of imperfection**](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)**, building a case for** [**why this person isn’t enough, creating an impossible standard so I never have to risk being truly vulnerable**.](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)

Sometimes we [criticize partners for being imperfect](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) because it’s safer than admitting we’re terrified of [being seen in our own imperfectio](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)n.

Notice when you’re [editing yourself to be more lovable](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). When you’re [performing instead of showing up as you actually are](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) — messy, uncertain, imperfect, human.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

You deserve a love that feels like peace, not chaos.

Notice when [you’re criticizing your partner for being human](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). While [Venus moves through Virgo](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb), distinguish between healthy standards (I deserve respect, honesty) and perfectionism (you must never disappoint me). One protects. The other isolates.

Venus in virgo [traits teach that intimacy lives in unglamorous moment](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)s — [morning breath, bad moods, vulnerable admissions](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb).

>

# 5. Love Rituals: Practical Astrology in Daily Action

[Venus in Virgo’s energy thrives on ritual](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) — the real, unglamorous kind that [builds intimacy when nobody’s watching](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb).

What this looks like: [Daily check-ins sharing one thing you’re grateful for](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). Five minutes of undistracted conversation before bed. Weekly walks discussing what’s working. Monthly practices asking:[ “How can I love you better?”](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)

These aren’t performative gestures. [They’re **the scaffolding holding relationships together**.](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)

During this transit, [consistency matters more than intensity](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). Small daily rituals [practiced for months create more intimacy than grand gestures](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb).

Create one [sustainable ritual this week something small enough](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) to maintain. Something that says:[ “I’m choosing you, again.”](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)

[Venus in Virgo’s practical energy](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) reveals how sacred the mundane can be. How washing dishes together becomes meditation.[ How showing up consistently creates intimacy.](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)

# The Love That Lasts: Your Venus in Virgo Choice Point

[Three weeks into the transit](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb), I returned to my tarot reader. Same spread. [Completely different energy](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb).

The [Two of Cups appeared upright not because the universe](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) fixed my relationship, but because I’d stopped trying to [fix my partner and started healing my own patterns.](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)

“I was so focused [on making him perfect that I forgot to just… be with him](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb),” I told her. “I was [performing partnership instead of partnering](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb).”

That’s the gift as [Venus transits Virgo](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). The invitation to stop performing [love and start practicing it](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). To trade [perfectionism for presence](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb).

This [transit won’t make relationships magically easy](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). What it offers is [**cosmic support to love in a way that sustains you both**](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) — if you’re willing to work.

**Between October 23 and November 16, 2025,** [**Venus in Virgo asks: “Are you willing to do what love requires?”**](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)

Are you willing to [examine relationship patterns with brutal honesty](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)? Get help [healing attachment style and relationship trauma?](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) Show up consistently even when it’s not exciting? [Love an imperfect human without trying to fix them?](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)

Your answer [determines whether this transit becomes genuine transformation](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) or just another cosmic event you forget.

The [cosmic window is open for 24 days](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). While [Venus moves through Virgo](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb), you have [clarity to see your patterns, practical energy to change them, and cosmic timing](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb) that makes healing integrate deeper.

The [kind of love that proves itself through daily action, not just feelings](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb). The kind that [deepens over years instead of burning out.](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)

**This is** [**your invitation to build something real**](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)**. What you do with it** [**determines everything.**](https://app.coto.world/oWeGEsh4DXb)",1,1761050603.0,u_cotoapp25,0,1.0,False
1ocbwa7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ocbwa7/aitah_for_asking_for_more_support_from_my_husband/,AITAH for asking for more support from my husband in pregnancy,"I’m 7 months pregnant and in the third trimester and have struggled with pregnancy symptoms throughout my pregnancy. It’s been tough and my husband has mostly supported me. He beared my terrible moods in the first trimester, massages my back sometimes, helps out. But I do need him more than that. I have to usually ask him to help me or remind him of my limitations because of pregnancy and that makes me feel as if he doesn’t think about me enough to realise these himself. Every part of my life is affected by this pregnancy so I don’t get the luxury to not think about it. When I remind him he sometimes gets annoyed and sometimes says insensitive things. Even though he’s very loving and caring it’s just sometimes when he says these things I feel really heartbroken and upset. It doesn’t help that I’m overly sensitive due to pregnancy either. He does feel bad later on and feels guilty and later texts me especially in the morning at work that he wishes he could do more for me and that I deserve more but he’s unable to. I feel like work and stress is overwhelming him and it always has and I know that it really is stressful because I used to work with him as well so no one understands it better than me. But I feel like this is the time that I need him the most and he needs to compartmentalise work in his brain so he can look after me. I won’t need him all my life it’s temporary. 

I feel like if I say this to him he will think I’m being ungrateful and focusing on what he doesn’t do rather than what he does (he has said this to me before). He does sometimes get me food from the kitchen and bring them to me and worry about my nutrition, comes to all my doctors appointments, scans, tests and is very involved in them, we have had some pregnancy related emergencies and had to go to the hospital and he stuck by me and took care of me throughout my hospital stay and reassured me. Maybe I’m asking for too much if I want him to do more? Like help out around the house without being asked to, being more aware of my limitations or getting me food or coffee or water without being asked to, massaging me without being asked to. He does do them when I ask but usually it’s with some reluctance and all the while reminding me how stressed and tired he is, these reactions usually come for things that I technically CAN do myself but feel tired to do like get water or food from the kitchen or clean up. But other times he also does it positively, especially for things he knows I can’t anymore because of my bump. 

AITAH for asking for more? 

EDIT: for more context, I’m not currently working and feel grateful of that because I get to rest more. While my husband (also has the same job I used to have - we worked together) has a very stressful and overwhelming job and is usually maxed out when he comes home. So I guess I do feel guilty expecting him to support me when he comes home but at the same I do everything for myself while he’s at work so when he comes home there’s this expectation that now he should support me though I’m not sure if that’s fair to him.

As the title suggests, I’m looking for good cafés where I can study comfortably. I’ve tried Oh My Goodness and Anticafé, but I didn’t like the coffee at OMG and Anticafé is a little too expensive if you stay there for more than 3 hours everyday…So I was wondering if you have any other suggestions?

1ocbuea,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1ocbuea/my_best_friend_ghosted_me_does_this_happen_in_30s/,"My best friend ghosted me, does this happen in 30s phase of life?","I started grad school in 2017 in a relatively small program of about 25 people. I quickly befriended another girl in the program, we can call her Beth, and an immediate close friendship was established. We started meeting at coffee shops to work on assignments together, going out for drinks and dinner after class, going to eachother apartments to hangout and do homework. In a few months time Beth had become one of my closest friends who I told everything about my day to day life with dating, family issues, and she did the same. 

Our relationship evolved beyond school, to just hanging out and joining each others social circles. From this I picked up on that Beth was from an extremely privileged background, and visited her families $15 million ski home in the state we were studying. Beth was quite humble and down to earth, and while she must have realized we weren’t from the same caliber of wealth it was never an issue and she was always extremely generous in paying for things outside of my reach if we were at a bougie dinner or bar. 

The program we were doing in grad school was very technical and computer science focused, and this was not Beth’s background. She wanted to work in a more Product/Program Manager focused role after finishing, and thought this was the best route. My background was however quite matched to this, and I felt comfortable with a lot of our hands on and more technical courses and work. I helped Beth a lot when it came to schoolwork and more technical concepts. On occasion I would let her just look at my work if she was late to a deadline or needed extra help. I never thought much of this, we really felt like best friends and of course I just wanted to help her out. 

Towards the end of our program we were as close as could be. Spending nearly 6 days a week together for both school and just hanging out socially, either 1 on 1 or with other friends. She introduced me to her family, best friends, and boyfriend. I never second guessed our relationship and we rarely ever fought or had issues. We had a 5 week seminar abroad coming up and were  very excited for the experience. On the trip, I met my future ex-boyfriend. I spent a lot of time with him while abroad, falling in love and living my best life. She did express some jealousy and disappointment in me, for not spending every evening after coursework hanging out with her. I thought she would understand as she had recently entered a relationship herself, and had also in that recent past cancelled several plans with me to do stuff with him. It didn’t bother me much, but when she reacted like this I was a bit hurt and confused. 

Things went back to normal after we returned to our home city, both dating our boyfriends and hanging out as normal. The end of our graduate program was coming up and we even had a joint graduation party at my apartment with our friends and family. I really thought she would be one of my best friends for life with how close we were in these days. 

We both got professional jobs after graduating, and stayed in the same city. Beth and I were still hanging out several times a week and texting/communicating daily. 

Right before covid I was sexually assaulted and it was a very traumatic event for me. I vented about it to Beth and another close friend who I had met through her. I thought Beth’s reaction was a bit strange and non-sympathetic, almost seeming like she didn’t want to hear about this dark cloud in my life. She was still relatively supportive through this time, and then with Covid happening shortly after everything was strange so I lost sight of that issue.

Beth returned to her family during Covid so we didn’t see much of eachother even when social distancing was allowed, but we still talked and texted every day, with lots of FaceTimes. We were still extremely close, and when she came back after Covid we resumed our hanging out almost as normal. 

I decided in 2021 that I had spent a lot of time in this city and had been through a lot, and needed to change. I was in a remote position who encouraged me to move to the west coast, so I went with that. When I told Beth she was a bit quiet and cold, telling me to stay yet also sounding very uninterested. We hung out until the day before I moved, and she even hosted a dinner for me on my last night and helped me pack my car. 

This was the last time I thought of Beth as a friend. I drove off the next day, texting her and updating her pictures of my journey, and didn’t get any responses. After 3 days of driving I called her and she didn’t answer. Another couple days go by and I get a very short ‘hey sorry I’m super busy with work’ text. I replied asking how she was, and what was new. We were used to communicating daily about our lives, so I felt very anxious and stressed about this. More days went by with no reply, and I sent a more asserting message asking if we weren’t friends anymore or what the situation was. She just said she misses me and loves me and just has been busy. I thought I’d leave it for her to re-engage communication when she was ready, and she never did. 

We had plans for her to come visit my new city, which were never spoken about again. My birthday went by without a message, and I came to terms with that our friendship was fully over. 

I am still deeply confused about this to this day. I have spent a lot of time thinking about what I could have said or done to make her ghost me like this. Years have gone by at this point, without a word from her, but it still haunts me. 

Just last night I had a dream that she confronted me that I had upset her and she didn’t want to speak to me ever again. I guess that is what has inspired this Reddit post. I have had many similar dreams of this, with my mind trying to cope with this loss of friendship. I have even had a dream before where she just hugs me and tells me she is sorry, and I woke up hysterically crying. 

Part of me wonders and feels like she used me in grad school to get through the difficult technical work, and then I was too far inserted into her life for her to abandon me at graduation, so she then just took her first chance when I moved out of state. 

I sent a drunk text last year vaguely explaining my confusion about the situation and I wished she would have just told me she didn’t want to be friends anymore. That text was never replied to.

I have moved on with my life, I’m married, in another new city, with lots of great friends both old and new. My friendship with Beth still haunts me though. It puts a pit in my stomach to think about how someone I thought was my closest friend, disappeared after throwing me a goodbye dinner. 

It makes my stomach hurt even more to think about her at that dinner, and if she was just waiting in that moment to be rid of me forever. 

I’m not a perfect person, nor a perfect friend, but I thought her and I really had something genuine and we contributed a lot to each others lives. I can be awkward at times, and I’m not extremely wealthy like her other friends, but I never thought she was that type of person.

🌿 Morning Garden Lo-Fi for Cozy Gamers & Chill Garden Vibes

I made a Lo-Fi EP that feels like drinking a warm coffee in a quiet garden just after sunrise.

I was thinking of that peaceful moment when you start your day slowly — maybe tending plants, maybe farming in a cozy game, maybe just breathing.

If you like calm garden mornings, this might fit your vibe.

Curious — do any of you listen to other music like this while you play Gardenscapes in the morning?

Would love feedback — hope you enjoy ;)

1ocbpgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perfumes/comments/1ocbpgb/proper_coffee_scent/,Proper coffee scent.,"Friends, Romans, fragrance fans! Lend me your noses.
I'm in search of a coffee perfume, something perky and bright. But I need the coffee note to be the star, not an ""also ran"". I want to smell like I've just got out of the shower, wrapped myself in a snuggly bathrobe and brewed that fancy coffee I bought at the farmers market yesterday.

Stuff I've tried but not liked:

Black opium intense- hell no. I got no coffee and a lot of liquorice and jasmine neither of which I like.

Cardamon coffee lush - starts ok but then smells like I burned the coffee.

Essence vault 970 - allegedly a dupe of coffee break. Smells like something you'd buy your teenage nephew for Xmas. No coffee what so ever.

Autumn vibes - smells like a cheap curry house and sweat to me.

Stuff I love that isn't the vibe I want:

Coco mademoiselle- my go to ""clean and girlie""

Burberry goddess - cosy and happy

Milk expressive - my sleep perfume. 

Elizabeth arden Green tea - another crowd pleaser

Penhaligon Halefti - Date night staple.

I'm open to niche, mainstream and dupes. Budget is £100 but I loooove a bargain.

1ocbp60,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ocbp60/the_hiker/,The Hiker,"“Better throw some more logs on,” Colin suggested.

Ryan, apparently thinking the same, began to do just that. The two men sat across from each other, shadows flickering across their faces.

It was a bitterly cold night in the Scottish Highlands—the kind of cold that bit through layers and promised sickness if you weren’t prepared. But for the two friends, it was a dream come true. Two young, eager Americans from a small town in Colorado had somehow made it to the far side of the world, hiking through the wild beauty of Scotland. Being from Denver, they were no strangers to the cold, but this was different—colder, deeper, older somehow.

“I wonder what it’s like back home right now,” Ryan said, blowing into his hands and rubbing them together.

“Haven’t even given it a thought,” Colin replied, looking up at the sky. The stars shone bright and endless—no light pollution for fifty miles, only the deep black canvas of night and the glittering constellations above. Their camp sat in a circular clearing surrounded by towering Scots pines.

Colin tried not to think of home. His grandmother had died recently, and though he felt he should mourn, he couldn’t. She’d been cruel—quick with her hand, even when it wasn’t called for. Colin had been a good kid: straight-A student, volunteer, always helping others. None of that mattered to her. Any excuse to strike, she took it.

When she died, to everyone’s shock, she left behind a small fortune—and most of it went to Colin. With that money, he’d put a deposit on a house in Windsor, just outside Denver, and decided to travel before starting his career. Scotland had always been the dream, ever since he and Ryan were teenagers. So when Colin came into the money, he lent Ryan enough to join him.

Ryan swore he’d pay it back someday, but Colin didn’t care. He was just glad his best friend was here with him.

They sat in silence, an unspoken agreement to simply be. The world around them was still and sacred. The flames licked the night air, their crackle the only sound breaking the calm. For the first time in his life, Colin felt true peace.

Hours passed. The two drifted between quiet conversation and comfortable silence. Colin’s mind wandered—to his new house, his family, his mother’s tearful goodbye, his father’s firm handshake, and the thrill of landing in Glasgow.

He thought of Heather, the kind woman they’d met in Aviemore. She’d found them in a local pub, cold and without a place to stay. A single mother of two boys—Craig and Gordon—she’d insisted they sleep on her couch. She’d fed them a hearty meal, and the evening had been filled with laughter and games. When Colin tried to pay her, she refused—until he pressed the money into her hand.

That kind of generosity, he thought, only comes from people who have little to spare.

His parents were like that too—kind, selfless. Nothing like his grandmother. The thought of her soured the peace he’d found.

He remembered the sting of her slap when he was just seven—spilling a drop of juice on her floor one Christmas. He’d never told his parents. As a child, he’d thought it was his fault.

And yet, she’d left him all that money. Maybe guilt. Maybe something darker.
Her voice echoed in his head: Money can’t buy everything—that can be the curse of it.

He smirked. “Thanks for the money, Grandma,” he thought, then under his breath: “But thanks for nothing else, you miserable old witch.”

He chuckled, then stopped himself. He didn’t enjoy her death—but he didn’t mourn her either.

A sharp snap broke the night.

Both men froze, turning toward the sound—like deer sensing a hunter. The forest, once peaceful, now loomed dark and menacing.

Another snap. Closer this time.

The two knelt beside the fire, eyes straining into the void beyond the trees. Slowly, a figure emerged from the darkness—hands raised in a gesture of peace.

“Gentlemen. Good evening,” the man said, stopping about fifteen feet away. “I’m sorry if I startled you. That wasn’t my intent.”

Colin’s heart pounded. A stranger in the middle of the Highlands, in the dead of night, wasn’t exactly comforting.

And his accent—it wasn’t Scottish. In fact, it wasn’t anything familiar. Smooth, calm, educated… but uncanny.

“I seem to be lost,” the man continued. “Could I trouble you for a bit of warmth?”

He stepped closer, and Colin saw him clearly now: tall, broad-shouldered, dark hair neatly parted, a well-kept beard. Handsome—movie-star handsome. But his clothes were wrong. Jeans, a casual jacket, a t-shirt beneath. No thermals, no gloves, no gear. Just a small backpack slung over his shoulder.

“Man, you must be freezing!” Ryan said before Colin could speak. “Of course, sit down.”

“How kind of you,” the stranger said with a faint smile. He sat, placing his bag between his legs.

“This is very kind of you,” he said again. “I’d have been wandering for hours.”

“Not a problem,” Ryan replied. “Couldn’t let you freeze.”

The man nodded, expression unreadable.

“What’s your name?” Colin asked cautiously.

The stranger ignored the question. “Mind if I smoke?”

“Sure—free count—” Ryan began, but the man was already lighting a cigarette. He took a slow drag, eyes fixed on the flames.

“So,” Ryan said, breaking the silence, “we’re heading to the Isle of Skye tomorrow. How about you?”

No response. Just the hiss of the cigarette and the fire’s crackle.

Then—“Sorry,” the stranger said softly. “Got lost in thought. The flames reminded me of… somewhere else.” He smiled faintly. “Call me Aamon. Doesn’t matter anyway.”

Colin’s unease grew heavier. He and Ryan exchanged a look—one that said we shouldn’t have let this guy sit down.

“So, tell us about yourself,” Ryan offered politely.

“No.”

The word was flat, final. Colin felt his jaw tighten.

“Look, man, if you’re gonna be an ass—”

“The human race is a funny thing, isn’t it, gentlemen?” Aamon interrupted. His tone shifted—calm, almost philosophical. “It was given everything: freedom, choice, the chance to do good. And what did it choose instead? War. Greed. Cruelty. Money.”

He took another drag.

“Are you a preacher or something?” Ryan asked, trying to keep things light.

Aamon laughed—a low, hollow sound. “Preach? Praise him? Him and his sanctimonious son?” He spat the words. “No. I don’t preach.”

Ryan and Colin exchanged a glance. Ryan mouthed, What the fuck?

“What the fuck indeed, Ryan,” Aamon said suddenly.

Both men froze. Neither had told him their names.

He turned to Ryan, smiling like a wolf. “You had potential. Smart, athletic, charming. But you wasted it. Lied, stole, used your friend’s generosity to get here.”

Ryan’s face drained of color.

“Your parents—Robert and Elizabeth—good people. You disappointed them. Your sin?” He tilted his head. “Greed.”

Ryan could barely speak. “H-how do you know—”

“Greed,” Aamon repeated, clapping mockingly. “Your entire soul for a few dollars. Pathetic.”

Then he turned to Colin. “And you. Your grandmother says hello.”

Colin’s stomach dropped.

“She hated you, you know. Made a deal before she died—to make sure you’d pay your due.”

Aamon smiled. “I’ve seen kingdoms fall. I’ve watched plagues consume nations. I even whispered a few ideas into the ears of tyrants. The Holocaust? Not my idea—but I nudged it along.”

“This isn’t real,” Colin whispered.

“It’s very real,” Aamon said, blowing smoke rings into the air. “And do you know what still gives me joy? The hunt.”

“For example this shell right here” Aamon waved his hands over himself 

“Derek this one was named. He had a happy life, a fiancè Claire. They were happy. But you humans and your hatred leaves a stain on existence that even death cannot remove. I hunted him for 3 days. It was fun the first day, but I think I prolonged the next 2 for my pleasure truth be told. Just to try and get that thrill back”

He lifted his backpack, unzipped it slowly.

“I found a village on my way here. Met a kind woman—single mother, two sons. Heather, I think her name was?”

Colin’s blood turned to ice.

“She was struggling. So, in the spirit of mercy…” He reached into the bag and pulled out Heather’s severed head. “…I ended her suffering.”

Both men fell backward in horror.

“Don’t. Move.” The voice that came next wasn’t human—deep, guttural, vibrating through their bones.

An invisible force gripped them, locking them in place.

“Children are too easy,” Aamon said, voice calm again. “But when you kill them in front of their mother…” He smiled, holding Heather’s head up. Her empty sockets faced Colin, her expression frozen in terror.

“Was a fun date, wasn’t it, darling?” He kissed her cold lips. Ryan vomited into the dirt.

“You know why she hated you, Colin?” Aamon said softly. “She envied you. Envy.”

He dropped the head like it was nothing.

“Now,” he said, lighting another cigarette, “let’s make this interesting. Doing it here—no sport in that.”

He leaned forward, eyes closing. When they opened again, they were pitch black—bottomless.

His teeth were sharp now, his smile inhuman.

In that deep, otherworldly voice, he said just one word:

“Run.”

He then blew onto the fire and like a candle in a strong wind, it was out in the blink of an eye. Darkness.

Darkness swallowed everything.

For a second, Colin couldn’t breathe. The world had vanished—no firelight, no stars, no sound. Only cold.

Then came motion. Scrambling. The sound of Ryan’s boots tearing through the underbrush.

“Ryan!” Colin shouted, his voice cracking.
No reply—only the forest breathing around him.

Something moved behind him.

He didn’t wait. He ran.

Branches tore at his clothes, roots reached for his feet, the air burning in his lungs. His pulse thundered in his ears. Every step felt slower than the one before. He didn’t know where he was going—just away.

The cold bit harder now, slicing into his bones. His breath came in ragged gasps, pluming white in the dark.

Then—through the trees—he saw it.
A shape. A shadowed outline against the night.

A building.

He half-stumbled, half-crawled toward it. It was a small stone cottage, slanted and forgotten, its roof bowed under age and moss. A single wooden door hung crookedly on its hinges, the windows cracked and black. It looked centuries old, swallowed by the forest and spat back out.

But it was shelter. A chance.

He pushed through the door—it groaned open with a long, aching creak.
Inside was darkness, thicker than outside, but the air was still and dry. His flashlight flickered weakly as he pulled it from his pocket and clicked it on.

The beam caught dust motes floating like ghosts. A wooden table, half-rotted. A chair lying on its side. Torn wallpaper curling from damp stone.
And something else—a faint smell. Sweet, sickly. Like flowers left too long in a vase.

Colin stepped carefully inside, closing the door behind him. His chest still heaved from running.

“Okay…” he whispered to himself. “You’re safe now. Just… breathe.”

The floor creaked under his boots. He moved the beam across the walls—old portraits hung crookedly, faces faded with time.
Then he froze.

One of the portraits wasn’t faded at all.

It showed a woman. Pale, severe, hair pinned back in a bun.
He knew that face.
He’d seen it every Christmas, every birthday card, every nightmare.

His grandmother.

Colin’s stomach turned. He stepped closer, shining the light on it. The paint looked fresh, wet even—as if it had just been finished.
He reached out a shaking hand to touch the frame—

The light flickered.
When it came back on, the portrait was empty.
Just a blank, yellowed canvas.

He stumbled backward, his breath quickening.

“Hello, Colin.”

The voice came from behind him.

He spun around—his flashlight trembling—and there she was.
Standing in the corner of the room.

It was her

Her hair was gray and stringy now, falling loose around her face. Her eyes, the same cold blue as his childhood nightmares, stared right through him. Her skin was pale, translucent, stretched thin like wax paper.
But she was real.

“No…” he whispered. “You’re dead.”

She smiled, just enough to show yellow teeth. “You say that like it matters.”

Colin’s throat tightened. “You’re not real. You’re just—”

“Ungrateful,” she snapped, voice sharp and venomous. “Even after everything I gave you.”

“You—” His voice cracked. “You hit me. You made my life hell.”

Her head tilted. “You deserved every bit of it. Spoiled little brat. Always playing the victim. Always pretending you were better than me.”

Her voice grew louder, filling the small room, overlapping itself like echoes from a well.

“You think I wanted to leave you that money? You think you earned it? That was my money, Colin! Mine!”

He stumbled backward, the flashlight beam shaking across the walls as her voice rose to a shriek.

“I gave you everything, and you gave me nothing! You never even came to visit when I was dying!”

The smell in the air changed—burnt, metallic. His stomach turned. The walls seemed to pulse with the sound of her words.

“I—” He choked on his words. “You’re not her. You’re something else.”

The old woman’s lips curled into a grin. “Oh, I’m her, boy. Just… improved.”

Her skin rippled like liquid shadow, her eyes turning black. The voice that came next wasn’t hers anymore—it was his.

Aamon’s.

“She always hated you, Colin. I just gave her the chance to show it properly.”

Colin screamed and threw the flashlight—it clattered across the floor and went out. The room was plunged into darkness again.
He felt for the door, stumbled through it, and burst out into the cold night air.

He didn’t look back.

He ran again—branches clawing at him, the forest spinning in every direction. His breath came in short, frantic gasps. His heart was a drum of panic in his chest.

Then, up ahead—movement.

The moon moved from behind the clouds, bringing with it a thankful faint light. 

A figure standing among the trees.

“Ryan!” Colin shouted, relief breaking through the terror. “Ryan, thank God—”

He stopped dead.

Ryan didn’t move. Didn’t answer.
And when Colin stepped closer, he saw his friend’s eyes—black, bottomless, wrong.

Ryan tilted his head, slow and unnatural. Then he smiled.

Aamon’s smile.

“Run faster, Colin,” said Ryan’s voice—but layered, distorted, two voices in one.

Ryan’s body twisted, bones cracking, collapsing to the ground like a marionette whose strings had been cut.

Colin’s scream tore through the forest.

He didn’t know how long he ran—seconds, minutes, hours. The forrest felt endless, the dark alive, shifting with every breath he took.

Eventually, his foot caught on something—a root, maybe—and he went down hard.

When Colin opened his eyes again, the air felt… different.

Warm. Dry.

The scent of pine was gone, replaced by the faint smell of coffee and cinnamon.

Light flooded in through half-closed blinds. He blinked hard, his eyes adjusting to the familiar layout of his parents’ living room — the leather sofa, the bookshelf lined with old photos, his mom’s favorite cross-stitch hanging crooked on the wall.

“Jesus…” he whispered, pressing his palms to his head.

It was over. It had to be.

The forest, Aamon, Ryan — all of it just a dream. A nightmare brought on by exhaustion and too many ghost stories by the campfire.

He laughed softly to himself, the sound shaking. “Get a grip, man…”

A kettle whistled faintly from the kitchen. His mom’s voice followed — calm, sing-song, familiar.

“Breakfast’s ready, sweetheart.”

Colin froze.

He turned toward the kitchen doorway.

There she was. His mother — just as he remembered her. Still in her robe, hair tied up, smile kind and knowing.

“Hey, honey,” she said, setting a plate of pancakes on the table. “You had us worried. You’ve been out for a while.”

Colin’s throat tightened.

“Mom…”

He stood, every muscle trembling. She opened her arms and he fell into them, breathing in the smell of her perfume — something floral and old-fashioned. For a second, it felt real.

“Where’s Dad?” he asked.

“Outside, checking the car,” she said. “You two have a long drive ahead. Ryan’s waiting for you.”

The name hit him like a knife between the ribs.

“What did you say?”

She smiled wider. “Ryan’s waiting.”

Something about her eyes was off — too still, too dark.

He pulled away slightly, his chest rising and falling.

“Mom… Ryan’s dead.”

The sound of cutlery stopped. She stared at him, head tilted. “Now why would you say something like that?”

Colin stepped back. The room felt colder now, the colours dulling, draining away like watercolour under rain.

“Because… he’s dead,” he said again, more to himself than to her. “I saw—”

The sound of the front door opening cut him off.

Footsteps. Heavy. Slow.

“Morning, buddy,” came a voice.

Colin turned.

Ryan stood in the doorway, smiling — the same smile he always had, easy and care free — but his eyes were wrong. They were black.

Completely black.

Colin stumbled back, hitting the table.

His mother stood behind him now, hand on his shoulder. Her fingers were ice-cold. “Told you he was waiting,” she whispered.

He spun — but it wasn’t her anymore. Her skin was gray, her mouth stretched far too wide. Her teeth — cracked, blackened.

And her eyes — his grandmother’s.

“Money can’t buy everything,” she crooned, her voice wet, gurgling. “That can be the curse of it.”

Colin screamed and shoved her back. The world shattered like glass around him — walls cracking, the air splitting with the sound of tearing fabric.

Ryan’s voice warped, echoing through the collapsing house.

“You can’t wake up, Colin. This isn’t a dream. This is what is awaiting you” 

Everything fell away.

The floor vanished.

He was falling again.

Through the ceiling, through the floor, through time itself — the house, the forest, the stars — until there was nothing but darkness.

Then — impact.

He hit the earth hard, his breath torn from his chest. The cold air of the Highlands flooded his lungs once more.

The forrest had him again.


“Come on… come on…” he muttered, dragging himself to a tree trunk, pressing his back against it.

He forced himself to breathe. In through the nose, out through the mouth. His chest ached. His vision swam.

Then came the sound again—footsteps. Slow. Measured. Crunching the frost-covered ground.

He pressed his hand over his mouth, trying not to breathe too loud.

“Colin…”

The voice was everywhere—echoing from every direction at once. Low and taunting, like the forest itself was whispering his name.

“Colin, Colin, Colin…”

He shut his eyes. He could feel it closing in. He could feel it—like static crawling over his skin.

A light breeze passed by his ear, and a voice—barely a whisper—said:

“Found you.”

1ocbonw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYfragrance/comments/1ocbonw/montales_ristretto_hazelnutsmoked_top_note/,Montale's Ristretto hazelnut/smoked top note,"So it's been almost a year I've been obsessed with this ""Ristretto"" (Intense Cafe stronger edition) by Montale opening.  
Though not declared I kept smelling this hazelnut note that impressed me. While Filbertone itself keeps reminding me about Nutella, I wanted to recreate this kind of fresh cut/blended hazelnut.

Yesterday I bought the formula from a website and studied it a little bit. Technically I'm not supposed to post it here for free or resell it, but what I'm more into is to examinate together what seems to be imparting that kind of smell.

So obviously the smoky/noir facet of coffee plays a big role in this, and the formula promises they directly used an **Arabica CO2** material. I'm not surprised, having tested myself the way how it evolves on skin. We're talking about a ***0.5%*** of total amount.

Then my guessing was good, and a combination of anise materials and clove ones should be the key. While I don't see anything strictly related to anise, there's a ***0.35%*** of **Anisyl Acetate** which I haven't tried myself and I'm not that sure if it's supposed to remind anise or be a part of the fruity-rose accord the entire fragrance is about.

So, clove... We've got a ***0.15%*** amount of **Methyl Isoeugenol**, and that's where my point went straight. Or I guess so.

And to end, the little secret. Though I haven't owned it till now, the formula shows a ***0.01%*** of **Ethyl Acetate**. As I read online, it's used as an accord modifier so it's not always related only to boozy/fruity side.

There's also a ***0.01%*** of **Acetoine**, but I don't think that's what I'm smelling.

Now, the rest of the work is entrusted to santal materials and ambery stuff like Karanal, but all those shine more in the base notes, imo.  
I just compared these ingredients with the basic Intense Cafe version formula and they share them. Maybe the secret is all about the amounts?  
Dunno. But the only one actually not inside the basic version is Coffee CO2 itself. I guess that's the reason I can't actually even smell a coffee note in such an infamous coffee-type perfume...

I'm placing a major order on Fraterworks and these gonna be in the chart. Wanna try out how this combo pairs with Filbertone. If I'm right this could be the path to the holy grail hazelnut note I was looking for so bad!  
I'll keep you updated if this post gonna be appreciated.

Let me know what do you think and if all this sounds reasonable to you.

We've had multiple conversations, she always seems happy to talk, maintains eye contact, laughs at my jokes (even the dumb ones), asks me questions about my life. All the signs people say indicate interest.

So yesterday I asked if she'd want to grab coffee sometime. She said ""oh that's really sweet but I'm not really looking to date anyone right now"" in this super nice apologetic way.

Which is fine, rejection happens, I can handle that. What I can't figure out is what signals I misread. Was she just being friendly and I interpreted it wrong? Does friendly just look exactly like interested and there's no way to tell the difference?

The confusing part is she still talked to me at the gym this morning. Same energy as before. So clearly I didn't make it weird by asking, but also what was I supposed to interpret differently from all our previous interactions?

I'm not upset about the rejection itself. I'm confused about how to tell the difference between ""this person enjoys talking to me"" and ""this person is romantically interested."" Because apparently I can't.

This has happened to me before too which is why I've been trying to get better at reading people. Been watching a lot of dating advice content, using apps like gleam and practical psychology stuff, reading body language guides. I thought I was improving but clearly I'm still missing something fundamental here, I thought reaching out here might give me another answer.

What are the actual signs someone is interested versus just being a friendly person who likes conversation? Because I genuinely cannot tell and I'd rather not misread situations in the future.",3,1761049823.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

My heart breaks every time I see somebody call themselves boring. You're looking at it all wrong and that's why you still feel the same way. Please read this and I'll try and prove it to you.

People don't care if you're interesting. They care how you make them feel.

Heres a thought experiment. Picture yourself alone at a fancy cocktail party that you have to attend for work. You would like to talk to people but you aren't sure what to say. At different times during the evening two different people approach you and make conversation. Heres how it goes:

Bob approaches you. You find out he just bought a boat. A 35ft with twin engines. He wrecked his old one racing it off of the coast of Portugal last year and almost died. Hes been doing kettle bell workouts to get his body back in shape and its working great. He thinks the wine they served at the cocktail party is shit and he bets they don't have a single real sommelier in the building. Hes going to do something about that actually, because he knows the guy that owns the place. He leaves his number on a napkin and says lets get coffee before he answers his Bluetooth headset and runs off.

Larry approaches you. He said hes feeling a little shy and he noticed that you were standing there alone. He doesn't care for big parties full of strangers. He asks if you like Dr Who. You arent really but you say you have heard of it and there is an awkward pause. He asks you what you do for fun and you say you love doing archery and renaissance fairs. Hes never done anything like that but hes interested to know more. Do they do those around here? What time of year? Do you have to dress up or can you just go? When's the next one? Larry says if you ever need someome to go with you that hes down and he asks if he can add you on Facebook.

Ok. Who are you going to call? Bob or Larry? Was it more important that they were interesting or was it more important that they were interested in you. You don't have to relate to everything. Fight that urge. Just be interested. If you make somebody else feel interesting, they will think the world of you.

I have cool hobbies. I make knives and tools in my metal shop. I like to take hallucinogens and go to music festivals. I don't talk about them, people dont give a shit and that doesnt hurt my feelings. Nobody is ever going to get a warm and fuzzy feeling from you because you have cool hobby

Most people are shy when it comes to making friends. Some people do walk around just bored and disinterested in others. Learn to recognize them and pay them no energy.

Take some time to appreciate yourself. Stop calling yourself boring. You arent a fucking jester here to entertain people. Youre an entire human being with just as much validity as anybody else. Love yourself for who you are, and help other people feel good about themselves and you will never feel lonely again.

Just remember to ask ""what do you do for fun?""

I’ve bootstrapped a startup, taught tech to thousands, and now split my time between campus case discussions, weightroom therapy, and discovering new filter coffee spots. My happy weekends are bookstores, board games, indie films, street food, and long walks where the conversation wanders further than we do. Values: empathy over ego, growth over gossip, craft over clout.

Seeking: an intellectually curious woman (21+), emotionally literate, open to slow-burn connection. Someone who lights up at a great question, a surprising insight, or a beautifully argued essay. Bonus if you enjoy museums, flea markets, quizzes, midnight desserts, or debating whether cities should be designed for cars or children.

What we can do: chai and a stroll through a bookshop; swap our top five life-changing reads; co-create a tiny fun project; or simply sit on a quiet bench and talk about the thing you can’t stop thinking about this week—economics, cinema, sport, design, psychology, poetry, cricket, F1—your pick.

Boundaries: strictly SFW; safety first; no pressure to escalate; consent is culture; kindness is non-negotiable.

If any of this resonates, send a thoughtful opener: your city, a recent idea that shook you, and a niche hill you’d die on. I’ll go first—mine change often, but right now: “Speed is a habit; depth is a practice.” I reply best to messages with curiosity, clarity, and a little wonder.

Apparently police reports can be considered tools of Satan if they embarrass the Mormon church.

1ocbjsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/starseeds/comments/1ocbjsb/the_gods_didnt_descend_from_the_heavens_they/,"The gods didn’t descend from the heavens, they re-entered through the womb","The “return” isn’t about gods or sky beings descending in glowing ships; it’s about souls returning, volunteers, Starseeds, like Dolores Cannon described, who’ve come back from higher civilisations, star systems, and densities to assist Earth through her frequency shift.

When ancient texts, prophecies, or indigenous traditions talk about the “return of the gods,” “the shining ones,” or “the sky people,” they’re remembering epochs when advanced beings were physically present, teachers, engineers of consciousness, the architects of early humanity. But the cyclical prophecy of return refers not to another visitation, it’s incarnation.

We’ve returned through human form, not to it.
That’s why so many people today carry vague star-memories, spontaneous awakenings, strange sensitivities, and an ache that they’re “here for something.” The Three Waves that Dolores spoke of are that return:

First Wave: The pioneers, born mid-20th century, who anchored higher frequency into post-war density.

Second Wave: The energetic transmitters, the 70s&80s souls who affect others simply through presence.

Third Wave: The children and young adults who arrive already wired for the new Earth frequencies, empathic, tech-telepathic, system-breaking.


So yes, the ancient “return of the sky people” wasn’t about ships blotting out the sun. It’s you and every other volunteer waking up, remembering your origin, reclaiming your creative power, and shifting the collective from the inside out. The “return” is already happening quietly in coffee shops, on construction sites, in studios, and through awakened conversations like this one.

It’s poetic, isn’t it?
The gods didn’t descend from the heavens,  they re-entered through the womb.

I did end up sending her flowers, which feels stupid but honestly it was an attempt to preemptively extinguish an extinction burst. I feel so alone. Luckily I have my husband, & he is really great. He is also NC with his cluster B mother. I also have all my friends spanning from childhood & early teenage life cheering me on. They’ve met my mother & were not fooled. This has helped me not gaslight myself. 

I guess I just feel really confused. Why can’t I enjoy this peace? I’m looking at the phone like a teenager anxious after a date, but instead it’s me being scared my mom is going to text. 

The fear & loneliness are eating me alive, but I know it’s for the best. My birthday is next week, & I’m expecting the full on extinction burst guilt trip if not today, on my birthday. That would be more fitting anyway. 

Also, I am NEVER angry, but I feel like I’ve *unlocked* a new emotion. I don’t know how to handle anger. Did this happen to any of you? I feel this pit of just rage in my stomach. Rage for how my life could have been. Rage for not knowing how to be an adult. Rage for how she treats me
-and, most sadly- rage for feeling alone now, even though I have such an amazing support system. I feel like I’m rapidly cycling through the DABDA grief model. That’s what it is, right? Grief?

Why am I such a glutton for punishment? This has been killing me for 33 years, but I feel like part of my “job” was managing her moods & caretaking. I just feel odd.

That of each new day,
I am reminded.
A brew, inviting a reunion, a familiarity.
No such time shall diminish the taste.
No such time shall tarnish the veins of repair.
For a ceramic mug,
with her durability,
can withstand irreparable damage.
In an environment plagued by plastic,
she remains naturally preferred.

Feedback, particularly grammatical or layout/spacing, is welcome!

For additional context, I wrote this for my best friend who also happens to be a barista and makes pottery. I have a coffee every morning. We especially bond over this. Sometimes we have periods of no contact but we always come back to each other. This is an appreciation poem I am hoping to share with them.

I've been dreading it for three weeks. Used to have full panic attacks before presentations: shaking hands, racing heart, voice trembling, face turning red.

This time I was still anxious but I got through it without falling apart. Even got positive feedback after which shocked me. Here's what actually helped:

Practiced way more than felt necessary. Went through the whole thing at least 20 times alone. Out loud, not in my head, because that's completely different. Filmed myself a few times to see what I actually looked like (not as terrible as I imagined).

Two days before, did a practice run with two coworkers in an empty conference room. Having even a tiny audience helped me realize the real thing wouldn't be as scary as my brain was building it up to be.

Morning of, no coffee. Caffeine plus anxiety is a disaster combination. Did breathing exercises for 10 minutes which actually calmed my nervous system down a bit.

Had notes as backup even though I tried not to read directly from them. Just knowing they were there helped.

Been working through public speaking scenarios on gleam which helped me practice handling questions and staying on track when nervous. Also did some other random prep like wearing an outfit I felt confident in and eating a good breakfast so I wasn't dealing with hunger on top of anxiety.

Still don't love presenting and probably never will. But now I know I can do it without completely falling apart. That's real progress.

If you have to present soon: over prepare, practice with any audience you can find, and remember the anticipation is worse than the actual thing.",14,1761048928.0,adhd_anxiety,3,1.0,False
1ocbaj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmallBizTalk/comments/1ocbaj8/how_is_ai_actually_helping_small_businesses_grow/,How is AI actually helping small businesses grow faster in 2025?,"**1. Opening Hook: The Shift Small Businesses Can’t Ignore**

It’s not just big corporations using AI anymore. Now, even coffee shops and freelancers are automating daily tasks. Picture the daily grind before AI: manually scheduling appointments, painstakingly tracking inventory by hand, and spending hours crafting marketing emails from scratch.

It was time-consuming and inefficient. Fast forward to 2025, tools are more affordable, work together more seamlessly, and small businesses fully integrate them into their operations. Whether you have a side hustle or a storefront, AI is quickly becoming an essential tool.

For instance, a bakery now utilizes AI to track inventory, allowing it to maintain optimal stock levels and minimize waste. This kind of integration helps streamline operations, making businesses more agile in a competitive landscape.

By automating mundane tasks, business owners can now focus on growth and innovation. Let’s examine how AI works currently and where it brings the most value to small business owners.

**2. The Real Value of AI for Small Business Owners**

Forget the sci-fi image of robots taking over. AI is just a more innovative tool that makes things easier. For small business owners, it helps save time, cut costs, and make better decisions with data that's easy to access.

On average, businesses report a 30% reduction in scheduling and administrative tasks due to automation, translating into significant labor cost savings. According to industry surveys, automating scheduling, sending invoices, or utilizing a chatbot for support can save small businesses up to 40 hours per month.

This provides entrepreneurs with real advantages despite having fewer resources, and it's available now. Let's examine where these benefits have the most impact.

**3. Where AI Makes the Biggest Difference Right Now**

So, where is this technology really making a difference? Here are the main areas where small businesses are seeing results. We’ll examine marketing, customer service, sales, and operations to see how AI is enhancing these areas.

To guide your AI journey, consider this simple two-step tool-selection checklist:

First, identify your most significant pain point, whether it's time-consuming manual tasks or inefficiencies in customer engagement. If scheduling is your pain point, try an AI calendar tool to automate and simplify this process.

Second, assess where AI can deliver the quickest return on investment, such as automating repetitive processes or enhancing customer interactions. For example, if customer service lags, a chatbot might be the quickest way to boost response times and satisfaction.

This framework can help turn curiosity into confident first moves.

* **Marketing and Content:** Making social media posts, ads, or emails used to take hours. Now, AI tools can create drafts in minutes, allowing owners to review and publish them quickly. It's like having a creative assistant working constantly.
* **To test this out:** Why not run a one-week minimum viable campaign? Challenge yourself to use AI-generated posts and measure the impact on your engagement. Track simple metrics, such as the number of likes, comments, or inquiries generated. These tangible results can help you see the effectiveness of your AI experiment. This brief experiment can help alleviate fears and demonstrate the value of AI in a quick and effective manner.
* **Customer Service:** Answering common questions repeatedly can be a time-consuming task. Chatbots are now available to respond to inquiries 24/7, freeing up owners to focus on growing their businesses.
* **Sales and Lead Nurture:** AI tracks leads and sends automatic follow-up messages, acting as a reliable sales assistant that consistently supports business growth and improves conversions.
* **Operations and Admin:** AI helps with reports, bookkeeping, and project timelines, making back-end work less stressful. You can spend less time on spreadsheets and more time with customers. With these practical benefits, it’s easy to see why businesses of all sizes are turning to AI.

**4. Success Stories You Can Relate To.**

You don’t have to be a large company to benefit from it. For example, a one-person online shop utilized an AI responder to reduce email response time by half, resulting in improved customer connections and reduced burnout.

Similarly, a café owner leveraged a free AI dashboard to predict inventory needs, preventing waste and saving money. These practical results are achievable with tools that are readily available to anyone. So, why is 2025 the perfect time to start?

**5. Why 2025 Is the Best Year to Start Using AI**

This year marks a pivotal moment in the global adoption of AI. Tools are more affordable, new solutions are introduced daily, and they are easier to use and more efficient than ever. Countries around the world are rapidly integrating AI into their small business ecosystems.

For instance, global stats say, *'60% of small businesses worldwide plan to implement AI solutions by the end of 2025'. In the local context, industries such as retail and hospitality are experiencing a surge in AI adoption, with many small businesses utilizing AI for inventory management and personalized customer experiences.*

Likewise, countries like the United States and Germany are leading the way in AI implementation among small businesses, with tailored solutions becoming a key differentiator in these markets.

This global momentum creates a competitive urgency for those who have not yet adopted these technologies. The main advantage is that by starting now, you can stay ahead of the curve.

Early adopters have more time to seize growth opportunities, whether that means launching new products, building relationships, or even taking a break.

In 2025, using AI is not just a choice but a necessity for staying competitive on a global scale.

**6. AI isn’t perfect.**

Its results depend on the information you provide, so accuracy is crucial. If you rely on it too much, you might miss important details.

Instead of worrying about AI replacing you, use it to handle routine tasks and save your own judgment for big decisions.

Finding the right balance is important.

**7. Closing Takeaway: Smarter, Not Harder**

Here’s the bottom line. Small businesses using AI every day are already ahead. AI saves time, cuts costs, helps you make better decisions, and lets you focus on growing your business instead of just handling daily tasks.

Start small, stay committed, and utilize AI for repetitive tasks so you can focus on what matters most. In 2025, working smarter with AI is the edge that can set you apart.

Why not take a first step today? Try automating one recurring email task and see how AI can make your day a little bit easier.",1,1761048869.0,SmallBizTalk,0,1.0,False
