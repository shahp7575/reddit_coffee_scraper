It would also be hard to ask him what time he'll be getting off at work without look like a psycho stalker.

I've been trying to do some flirty smiles and glances at him while I sit with my coffee and he does smile back but I'm not sure if he's just being ""customer friendly"" because again, he's working.

I also came up with weird ideas like writing my number on the receipt so when he calls me for my coffee, I'll hand him the receipt to ""confirm"" that that was really my order. But I'm afraid he might get in trouble with this also.

This also applies if you like someone at the cashier of the supermarket, a sexy nurse, the pizza delivery guy, the receptionist at the gym, etc.

The behavioural  science described in 'Nudge', co-authored by Sunstein, underpins the work of the hosts of this webinar, the Better Food Foundation, to use plant-based defaults and other nudges to help institutions like universities, hospitals, restaurants, and coffee shops, and events, dramatically reduce the amount of animal products they serve. 

In  their pilot studies, just by flipping the default, they've been able  to get 51%-82% of people to choose plant-based meals with very little friction. Sunstein is joining their board of advisers to continue to expand this work across our food system.   
  
BFF say: 'The challenge to reduce animal product consumption globally is a serious one for many reasons,   but climate change looms large. Recently, the EAT Lancet Commission published a report in which they state, **""Without substantial changes to the food  system, the worst effects of climate change will be unavoidable even if humans successfully  switch to cleaner energy.""'**

I typically put all of the liquids into a single 5 gallon bucket together after the process. This is a milky white solution. I've tried to leave it in the sun for 3 weeks in a clear container and all that seems to do is settle about a quarter inch of white sludge into the bottom of the container.

To my surprise, the liquid looks identical to what it looked like when I poured it in.

*We opted to take the 1 and 101 rather than the 5 for scenic reasons. Definitely worth the extra driving time. The Oregon Coast and Olympic Peninsula are breathtaking. The whole trip flew by in a flash.*

*For food, we had a car fridge and EcoFlow battery so we could have sandwiches, sodas, and other food to make meals more flexible since we mixed in some camping. We also had a JetBoil to heat up water, coffee, ramen, soups, and s’mores where there were campfire restrictions. Basically anywhere restaurants aren’t listed we ate our own food.*

I live at home with my mom, 91-year-old Pop-Pop, and identical twin brother Stephen. I work at Giant Food as a cart attendant and cashier. I've been doing this for over 3 years. 

I graduated from La Salle University in 2019 with a communications degree that i have never used. My twin brother has also never used his communications degree and he has no work history at all. My income is partially supporting my brother as well as my mom and my grandfather. I make about $13/hr and work about 20-24 hours per week. My twin brother and i were raised by a single mom as well as our grandparents. 

Our mom and Nana were extremely restrictive and controlling towards us growing up. As twins we have always had sort of an enmeshed relationship with each other too. I'm working on getting my drivers license right now. My brother doesn't drive and isnt working on it. Neither of us has any dating history at all (not even a first kiss) and we practically don't even talk about the subject with any of our family members even each other. Our mom does our laundry and prepares our meals. Most of our time is spent inside of our house using our smartphones as well as streaming services.


Our mom prepares our meals and feeds us mostly microwaveable food such as microwaveable chicken, microwaveable mixed vegetables, etc. She also feeds us comfort food like grilled cheeses, hot dogs, and sausage egg and cheese sandwiches quite frequently. She gives comfort food to our 91 year old Pop Pop often as well. She'll occasionally give him banana and I give him an orange as a snack a lot but other than that he doesn't really get any fruits and veggies besides the microwaveable vegetables.
We used to live with our Nana until she passed away in May 2024. My mom was in charge of changing our diapers and changing our clothes and getting her on the portable pottie regularly. I did admire my mom's compassion towards my Nana.

My mom doesn't leave the house much except for local errands such as a trip to the market or going to the bank or doing yard work. She occasionally goes to church. She also has been going out with a boyfriend (former classmate Tom Varrallo) every Saturday night. 


She doesn't really mind that my Stephen and I spend most of our time in our bedroom, that we have no friends at age 28, that we rarely leave the house, that we use our smartphones excessively, or that neither of us has ever had a girlfriend.
She kind of actually encourages our sedentary lifestyle and treats us like we are 10 even though we are 28. 
Our Nana, before she passed, also used to treat us like we were kids. She loved us very much but was extremely controlling and overprotective towards us and usually discouraged us from getting our drivers license or leaving the house on our own (without our mom present with us).

Our dad, who lives in New Jersey with our step family (step mom, and 2 sisters aged 16 and 19) is deeply concerned about our situation, specifically our lack of independence and goals.

I work at Giant Food as a cart attendant and cashier. Stephen has never worked even though he's 29 years old.



Here's all the chores my brother and I (at age 28) do around the house:

-wash the dishes (my brother usually just dries; our mom took care of washing the dishes for a long time until we eventually stepped up fairly recently; we don't own a dishwasher)

-make our beds

-my brother gets Pop-Pop dressed in the morning (he can't see)

-bring the grocery bags (from our online Shop Rite grocery order) in to the kitchen and dining room and unpack the bags (our mom usually puts everything away though I think a few times I helped her)

-occasionally help with taking the trash out

-assist our 91 year old Pop-Pop with other tasks (mobility, getting up and down the stairs, miscellaneous things he asks us to do)

I think that about covers it

Our mom handles
-cooking/food preparation (though it's usually microwaveable food)
-cleaning
-laundry for the whole house
-folding and putting away everybody's clothes
-paying the bills
-Basically anything financial 
-taking care of our student loans (I don't even know what my status is for that; last time I asked she said I'm behind a few payments but she usually gives a cryptic answer)
-vacuuming 
-decorating the house
-dusting 
-cleaning our bedroom and reorganizing it
-Changing our Nana; helpint her with getting on the potty; preparing her meals; schedulign her doctors appointments, etc (before she passed in May 2024)
-taking care of our Pop-Pop's pills and picking them up from the pharmacy (he takes 11 pills)
-Gardening/weeding/yard work
-killing bugs such as stink bugs and wasps when they enter our home
-packing my lunch or snacks for work
-dealing with all the legal work that has to be done with her sisters passing and mom's passing within the last year and a half

& probably stuff I'm forgetting

My brother and I both attended La Salle University (the same school our mom attended; she kind of decided that was where we were going to school) from 2015 to 2019. We both majored in communications (neither of us has used the degree at all; not even an entry level position or internship as of Jan 2025). We commuted to go to college. We both took a SEPTA bus. Our mom was in charge of our bus fare. Often it was late at night and we still hadn't finished our assignment that was due the next day or the following day and our mom would almost always finish it for us or ""ghost write"" it for us. Our mom was usually the one who typed our papers (as her mom had done for her) and she ALWAYS wrote our works cited for our papers.

In 2025 here is what i accomplished:

-got my learners permit in June and have since done 5 driving practice sessions with my dad and 1 with my Aunt Sue

-started using Amazon to make my own purchases

-went to two Phillies games (one with Dad and step family, one just me and my brother), both times navigating public transportation independently 

-went to the Eagles Super Bowl parade

-went downtown a few times with Stephen to Reading Terminal Market and navigated it independently 


Ok so thats some context even though I'm likely leaving out a lot


Alyssa is a 20 year old brown haired woman. She is pretty tall, maybe my height (5 ft 9). She has a baby face. She attends Montgomery County Community College.  She's a cashier at Giant. She loves video games (especially Minecraft and Genshin Impact), anime, and Comic Con. She lost her mom and lives with just her dad.



A few more things about Alyssa:

-she's very friendly
-she's very talkative
-she loves anime (though I'm not a fan)
-she enjoys playing Minecraft (heard her talking about it with a co worker and then she told a customer she was going to see the Minecraft movie; i also play Minecraft)
-she lives with her dad
-she lost her mom a couple years ago
-she has a self deprecating sense of humor
-we have a pretty good rapport as co-workers. I often talk to her in the break room or when we work the register together

 Would it be weird if we developed a connection for me to ask her to lunch or coffee date. I have no dating or relationship experience.

Is the age gap an issue i should consider carefully? 

Usually my crushes are on women closer to my age so it isnt like I intentionally am seeking a woman so young. It just happened to work out that way.

1o2g15r,https://www.reddit.com/r/flyingeurope/comments/1o2g15r/atpl_modular_theory_time_analysis/,ATPL Modular Theory Time Analysis,"Hi all,

I recently finished all the ATPL exams and figured I'd share my experience for those curious about how long it takes, especially for those with a full time job.

### Background
For comparison and so you know what knowledge I started with, a bit about me. I got my PPL in the US back in '08, didn't do much flying afterwards. I then moved to Germany and didn't fly for quite some time. I then converted my license and shortly thereafter decided to go for the ATPL. Because I always had big breaks in between my flying ""spurts"", I had to do a lot of checkouts and flight reviews, meaning I had to review things like air law and communications often to freshen up my memory. I also did a sailplane license which also required brushing up on meteorology and law. In a nutshell: I wasn't completely ""foreign"" to the material as one might expect after being away from it for so long, but I also wasn't a fresh PPL going straight into ATPL either.

### Duration

To begin, I started a timer whenever I studied a subject/did questions, so I have fairly accurate stats about which subjects took (for me) the longest, quickest, etc. Here's a general overview:

| Metric                     | Value                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Total study sessions   | 1,732                   |
| Date range             | 2024-03-30 - 2025-10-07 |
| Total study time       | 905.98 hours            |
| Average session length | 0.52 hours              |

| Subject                    |  Hours | Sessions |
| -------------------------- | -----: | -------: |
| Mass and Balance           |  33.32 |       47 |
| Communications             |  36.01 |       79 |
| Instrumentation            |  43.62 |       81 |
| Human Performance          |  44.87 |      108 |
| Operational Procedures     |  55.80 |      122 |
| Performance                |  67.87 |      130 |
| Aircraft General Knowledge |  70.53 |      165 |
| Radio Navigation           |  73.15 |      130 |
| Meteorology                |  75.15 |      160 |
| General Navigation         |  90.51 |      146 |
| Flight Planning            |  91.83 |      142 |
| Principles of Flight       |  99.33 |      201 |
| Air Law                    | 112.35 |      206 |

All in all, from start to finish, it took me just over 1.5 years working a full time job on the side.

### Sittings
I did it in three sittings (4-5-4) at Austrocontrol in this order:

* Sitting 1: MB, RNAV, LAW, COMM
* Sitting 2: FPLN, POF, OPS, PERF, HPL
* Sitting 3: GNAV, MET, INST, AGK

### Subjects
Here's a quick summary per subject of my subjective opinion of how easy/hard each was:

* **COMM**: Very easy; you can finish the test in 10 minutes or less. However, you *must* use the bank. There are quite a few questions that don't follow standard phraseology and if you haven't seen them before, you'll most likely get them wrong. Or you'll run into a question where the message is the same, but the callsign is either at the front or at the end. You need the bank to know which one they are looking for.
* **MB**: Very easy; this was actually interesting and the first one I started with. There's a couple of formulas you just need to remember (jot them down on your scratch paper at the start of the test) and then you can solve 90% of the questions. If you practice it a bunch, time pressure won't be an issue during the exam, even if you have to ""derive"" some answers from the base formulas.
* **RNAV**: Easyish; Also interesting, and is praxis relevant. It does go a bit too much into detail in some areas though. Learning how each radio aid works was cool, as well as understanding GPS. Learning what specific modulation codes certain signals used was not cool.
* **LAW**: Hard (a memorization fest); To be honest, I thought this was gonna be more ""relevant"" to the job. I was thinking something more along the lines of what a CPL would learn in the States, like about what they can and can't do for renumeration, when you will need an operating certificate, and so on. There was none of that. Instead you'll be covering very specific laws and when/where they were decided (e.g. Montreal Convention, Rome Convention, etc.). There is some interesting stuff in here, and some rehashing of stuff from PPL which is always nice to keep fresh, but otherwise it was a slog.
* **POF**: Medium; Again, an interesting subject but way overdone by going too much into the weeds. You'll need to calculate coefficients of lift using the 2D lift formula like you were an aeronautical engineer, among others.
* **OPS**: Hard (a memorization fest); I thought this one would be interesting, but besides some NAT HLA stuff (which from what I've been told is actually outdated?) it's memorizing things like how long an FDR should record and so on. 
* **PERF**: Medium/Hard; there's two parts to this one. First, understanding takeoff V speeds (e.g. V1, V2, etc) and how various factors affect them and the required field lengths. There's definitely some mind bending going on trying to get a grasp of the logic behind it, which to me seemed sometimes counterintuitive. But if you keep at it, you'll pick up on how things interact and it won't be so difficult. Second, is the graphs. Graphs are fun...until you get a question where the answers are so close together that you could answer incorrectly because of how you draw your lines. That can be frustrating.
* **FPLN**: Medium; This one was fun. Grab yourself a GSPRM and play around with the paper maps. In a way I think it's a bit sad everything has gone digital. Those enroute charts have a nice scent to them! Hardest part here is probably knowing how to calculate all the contingency fuels for various route setups and isolated airports and so forth.
* **HPL**: Medium; This one shouldn't be hard, but gets hard because there's a lot to memorize, like the size of a nasal spray droplet. You also learn how much coffee a day is considered ""excessive"", but then in another question have to answer that the acceptable amount to drink is literally the excessive amount. I enjoyed recapping all the sensory illusions, and that was probably the most valuable part. The rest was eh.
* **GNAV**: Medium; I thought this was going to be the hardest, but it actually wasn't. Yes, calculating GC and RL tracks with convergency and all that seems daunting at first, but really it's just an algorithm that you apply and if you draw the diagrams out and remember DIID you will get them all right. Using a calculator with a degrees button will save your life. Don't calculate degrees by hand! There's also more map stuff here, which is fun, except for when you need to find a point, and all the answers are within a few seconds of each other. I will say though, at the real exam, they print these maps for you on big paper. This makes getting an accurate result to the precision they desire way easier.
* **MET**: Mediumish; Definitely one that will be important with the job. I now know how a monsoon works, and have a solid understanding of fronts. However, apparently knowing how many hurricanes occur per year to the east and west of Darwin, Australia is also something everyone needs to know.
* **INST**: Easyish; I also like this subject so I found it easier than some of the others. Not much to say here. Interpretation of VORs and NDBs and so forth is in RNAV. This mainly focuses on how the instruments work, modern flight decks, and compasses.
* **AGK**: Mediumish; There's just a lot over a wide range in this subject. That's what makes it difficult. But now I know how a jet engine works, which is cool.

### Debrief
I could write tons about what I could have done better and so on, but I'll keep it short: if I had not taken breaks from studying and planned a bit better, I probably could have done it in a year. But then again, you never know what life will throw at you, so I think I did alright with the amount I did.

&nbsp;

If you have any questions about how I studied or anything really related to going through the process, I'll be glad to answer. I hope this post can give some insight to those going the modular route and give them a rough estimation of how long it might take.",3,1760039676.0,flyingeurope,0,1.0,False

1o2g0jw,https://shynecoffee.ca/four-sigmatic-ryze-shyne-comparison/,"We make mushroom coffee in Canada, so obviously I'm biased. But here's what Four Sigmatic and Ryze actually cost Canadians","\*\*Full disclosure: I run Shyne Coffee (mushroom coffee made in Ontario), so obviously I have skin in this game. But I did the math on what Canadians actually pay for US mushroom coffee brands and it's worse than I thought.\*\*



The TL;DR That'll Piss You Off:



If you're buying Four Sigmatic or Ryze from the US, you're paying:



🇨🇦 Currency conversion fees: 2.5% on every order

📦 Customs duties: $5-15 per shipment  

🚚 Brokerage fees: $10-20 per shipment

💸 Total yearly waste on fees alone: $180-420



That's not the coffee. That's just... fees. For no reason except crossing a border.



Here's The Actual Math:



I pulled pricing directly from all three websites and calculated what one cup per day for a year actually costs Canadians:



\*\*Shyne (ours):\*\* Instant format, $1.06 USD per cup, about $536 CAD per year with ZERO fees because we ship domestically



\*\*Four Sigmatic:\*\* Ground coffee, $1.23 USD per cup, about $833 CAD per year when you add currency conversion + customs + brokerage



\*\*Ryze:\*\* Instant format, $1.30 USD per cup, about $720 CAD per year with all the cross-border BS



You save $200-300 per year just by buying domestically. That's a weekend trip. New boots. Six months of Netflix. Whatever.



The Actual Product Comparison (Not Just Shilling):



\*\*Four Sigmatic:\*\*



✅ Tastes like actual coffee because it IS coffee (ground, requires brewing)

✅ 150mg caffeine which is full strength, more than regular coffee

✅ Confirmed fruiting bodies (the good stuff)

✅ 2 mushroom types: Lion's Mane + Chaga



❌ Ground coffee means you need a French press or coffee maker

❌ Only 13 servings per bag so you need 2+ bags per month

❌ Made in USA so Canadians get hit with all the fees



\*\*Ryze:\*\*



✅ Instant convenience, just add water

✅ 6 mushroom types if you want variety (Cordyceps, Lion's Mane, Reishi, Shiitake, Turkey Tail, King Trumpet)

✅ Lowest caffeine option at 48mg (half of regular coffee)



❌ No transparency on whether they use fruiting bodies or mycelium

❌ Don't specify dosages for individual mushrooms, just total blend weight

❌ Made in USA so same fee problem for Canadians



\*\*Shyne (ours, so take with grain of salt):\*\*



✅ Made in Ontario so zero cross-border BS for Canadians

✅ 500mg Lion's Mane per serving and we actually tell you the exact dosage

✅ Pre-sweetened with maple + cashew cream so it's ready to drink

✅ Instant format, hot or cold water

✅ Cheapest per-cup cost after first month discount

✅ 60-day money back guarantee even if you drink half the bag



❌ Only one mushroom type because we focused on Lion's Mane specifically

❌ Pre-sweetened might not be your thing if you like black coffee



Why I'm Posting This:



Look, we started Shyne specifically because we were tired of paying insane fees to ship coffee across a border, not knowing what dosage we were actually getting, and mystery ""proprietary blends"" with zero transparency.



I genuinely think Four Sigmatic makes great coffee. If you're in the US and you love the ritual of brewing ground coffee, buy theirs. It's good. If you want 6 mushroom types and minimal caffeine, Ryze is a solid option.



But if you're Canadian and you're paying $15 in brokerage fees every month to UPS for coffee that was packaged 2 hours from the border... come on. That's just dumb. 🤦‍♂️



The caffeine breakdown if you care:



☕ Four Sigmatic: 150mg (more than regular coffee)

☕ Shyne: 60-80mg (moderate, less jitters)  

☕ Ryze: 48mg (lowest option, good for quitting coffee)



Format differences matter way more than people think:



\*\*Ground coffee (Four Sigmatic):\*\* You need brewing equipment. Takes 5-10 minutes. Cleanup required. Can't make it at your desk. Useless when traveling. Only 13 servings per bag means you're ordering every 2 weeks.



\*\*Instant coffee (Ryze and Shyne):\*\* Ready in 30 seconds. Works anywhere. Zero cleanup. Perfect for travel. 30 servings = exactly one month.



If you're the kind of person who loves grinding beans and timing pour-overs, ground coffee is your jam. If you're reading this while late for a meeting, instant is the move.



The Full Breakdown:



I wrote a stupidly detailed comparison with all the pricing, caffeine content, taste descriptions (based on customer reviews), and fee calculations here: \[link to article\]



It's long. It's honest about our bias. But it's got actual numbers instead of vague ""pricing varies"" nonsense. I even included a section on what we WISH Four Sigmatic and Ryze would disclose but don't (exact mushroom dosages, fruiting body transparency, Canadian shipping costs).



AMA if you want. I'll answer questions about our competitors honestly because I'm not trying to pretend they suck. They don't. They're just not made here, and that matters if you're Canadian and tired of surprise fees.



P.S. - Yes, this is marketing. But it's also just... math. And I'm genuinely mad about those brokerage fees on behalf of all of us. 🇨🇦",1,1760039638.0,proudcanadianbrands,0,1.0,False

Ever wake up feeling like your joints are made of rusty hinges? 🙈 You're not alone! I mean, who needs a yoga mat when you can stretch right from your desk? Feeling stiff after 50 doesn’t have to be your new normal, and it might be time to swap some of that morning coffee for a minute of movement! 

Here’s the deal: **Desk yoga** can seriously change your game. Instead of just filling up on caffeine first thing, picture yourself shaking off the morning stiffness and giving your body a little love. Here’s a super-easy 5-minute routine you can do right at your desk. It’s like your morning coffee, but with extra flexibility (and no jitters).

### 5-Minute Morning Mobility Moves 🚶‍♀️

1. **Neck Rolls**  
   - Drop your chin to your chest and roll your head to the right. Feel that sweet stretch? Now go left. Repeat a few times. It’s like giving your neck a mini-vacation!

2. **Shoulder Shrugs**  
   - Lift those shoulders up to your ears like you’re trying to touch your earlobes, then let ‘em drop! Ahhh—doesn’t that feel good? 

3. **Seated Forward Bend**  
   - While seated, take a deep breath and as you exhale, lean forward and let your arms dangle. Just let it all hang out for a sec. Gratitude for gravity!

4. **Wrist Stretch**  
   - Reach one arm in front, palm up, and gently pull back on your fingers with the other hand. Repeat on the other side. Your wrists called; they want some TLC!

5. **Chair Twist**  
   - While seated, place your right hand on the back of the chair and twist your body to the right. Hold for a few breaths, then switch. You're basically a pretzel at this point but, like, a really cool one. 

Trust me on this—five minutes is nothing! That’s like scrolling through social media, but you come out feeling like a new person.

For me, that means a hot cup of coffee while planning my work — but every single time, that perfect coffee turns cold halfway through. I got tired of reheating it or just finishing it out of guilt. So I decided to test something new: smart coffee mugs. The kind that claim to keep your drink perfectly warm for hours.

At first, I thought they were just another gadget gimmick. But after spending weeks testing five of the latest models from 2025, I can honestly say these things have come a long way. They’re not toys anymore — they’re real pieces of tech that combine smart sensors, battery efficiency, and sleek design.

The first one I tried was the **Thermacup Premium Heated Mug**, and it instantly felt like a game-changer. It lasts up to 8 hours, lets you choose between five different heat levels (110°F–150°F), and has a clean LED temperature display. The build quality is top-notch — stainless steel wrapped in ceramic that looks elegant on any desk. It’s easily the best one for home, office, or even travel.

Next came the **SmrtMugg X Heated Coffee Mug**, which I’d call the power user’s choice. It has a massive 19oz capacity, an LCD temperature screen, and about 8 hours of battery life. The magnetic sliding lid and ergonomic handle make it super practical for long workdays or commutes. It’s functional and surprisingly well-built.

The **Nextmug Temperature-Controlled Mug** impressed me with its simplicity. It’s made in Boulder, Colorado, with three temperature presets (Warm 130°F, Hot 140°F, Piping 150°F) that you control using a single button. The matte ceramic finish gives it a modern, handcrafted feel. It’s perfect for people who care as much about aesthetics as they do performance.

Then there’s the **Vsitoo S3 Pro Smart Mug**, which is all about automation. It uses AI-based temperature detection to heat your drink automatically when it senses liquid inside. You can control everything through its app — set your preferred temperature, check the battery, and even customize heating behavior. It’s waterproof, comes with a charging coaster, and feels futuristic.

Finally, I tested the **Kepwam T2 Self-Heating Mug**, a solid budget option. It doesn’t have app control or fancy LEDs, but for the price, it’s honestly great. You get three preset heat settings, simple one-button control, and roughly 2.5 hours of battery life. If you’ve never owned a self-heating mug before, this one’s a great way to start.

After using all of them, here’s what I’ve learned: smart mugs have officially moved past the “gimmick” phase. The good ones — like Thermacup and SmrtMugg X — genuinely deliver consistent heat for hours without overheating or ruining the taste. They’re perfect for remote workers, students, or anyone who spends long hours at a desk. Even tea or hot chocolate lovers will appreciate them.

What I love most is how practical they are. We spend hundreds on coffee machines but still end up drinking cold coffee ten minutes later. These mugs solve that tiny, everyday annoyance in the most elegant way possible. They’re not just convenient — they make your morning routine feel a bit more human, more comfortable.

I made a full review video covering all five, with side-by-side heat tests, battery comparisons, and close-ups of the build quality. If you’re into smart gadgets, Amazon finds, or just love your coffee staying hot till the last drop, you’ll enjoy it:

👉 [Watch here: “Top 5 Smart Coffee Mugs 2025 – Which One Is Worth It?”](https://youtu.be/XWCH8oyiHtw)

I’d love to hear from anyone who’s been using a self-heating mug for a while. Do they hold up after a few months? Or do they end up in the drawer with all the other tech experiments? And if anyone has found one that charges via USB-C instead of a coaster, let me know — that’s the next one on my list.

1o2fwsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1o2fwsc/daughters_friend_moved_in_and_we_moved_out/,Daughters friend moved in and we moved out,"This happened a few years go and some of it is a bit hazy, but it's a wild story. Some backstory; Husband (m45) and I (f35) weren't married yet, but living together. Husband has four kids total, at the time two lived with him. I have two fur babies (dogs) and Daughter(f20) has a fur baby (cat.) Son (m22) is moving out, daughter still lives at home. Daughter's friend, let's call her Lilly (f21), is having issues at home. Maybe not as bad as she was saying, but I wasn't there so I don't know what is true and what isn't. I just know what happened while she was in our home. Anyways, Daughter is telling us about it and I talk with husband. He's known Lilly for awhile, some of what she's said about home life is true. I won't go into details, but kids shouldn't have to go through anything that causes trauma. I suggest letting Lilly move in with us to get her away from it and help guide her through the transition of experiencing normalcy. Everyone agrees, great idea. 

Lilly doesn't give Daughter an answer right away. Son has been moved out for a month and I'm thinking cool, we have an extra room. About six weeks of Son being gone Daughter says Lilly will be here in two weeks. My stomach fell out of my body. I should have said something then, but I didn't. It felt like my world was about to change. Lilly moves in, gets a job within a month. We discuss Daughter and Lilly helping with financial contribution to the household. I think it was $150 a month, $300 total. They're both over 18 and both have full time jobs, they can help with bills and learn how to adult. Conveniently we all work at the same place except my Husband. He works overnights at a manufacturing plant. We all have different days off, Lilly has her drivers license, but not a car yet. If I didn't have any plans on my days off I'd let Lilly and Daughter take my car. My car is 11 years old, a little bruised, but she's paid off and still running. 

Everything seems to be going good for the first month or so, but doesn't it always go good in the beginning? It was like when a new person starts at your place of work, they always do too much. Like calm down Jerry, we all know you aren't this invested. 

After the ""I'm wonderful"" phase things started getting weird. We'd all get off work at the same time. For whatever reason the girls, Lilly and Daughter, thought they needed to change out of work clothes into street clothes at work in the employee bathroom. I didn't care about changing my clothes. I wanted to go home. So I'd be sitting there waiting in my car 10-15 minutes waiting for them to come out. In that time we could have been home. After a couple weeks of it I asked that they please wait till we got home to change, the time it takes them to change we could have been home. I said it nastier than I intended to, I had a bad day at work and I was frustrated. I took it out on them.

Side note-I have gotten better since then. Speaking in anger is dangerous and the most regretful thing you can do. 

Then I notice my coffee creamer and coffee are being used faster. That's fine, doesn't bother me. Until the last of it is used and I'm not told so I can buy more. I NEED coffee. I am not a human till I've had my caffeine. Coffee is my only source of caffeine. If I could bleed coffee I would. So I talk to the girls about it. ""If you use the last of it please say so. You aren't the only one to use it and it's rude to not say anything when it's empty."" Then it's not just the coffee or creamer, it's other items in the fridge now too. Which is fine, I don't want them to starve. But why is it so hard to tell someone, ""Hey, I ate the last of the eggs. If you're having eggs tomorrow you may wanna get some more."" I don't know how many mornings I didn't have a breakfast. I'd sometimes cry when I saw there weren't any eggs or bread. Then I snapped. I was buying more and more creamer, coffee, eggs and we were still going through it sooooo fast. Daughter wanted to be nice and make Lilly coffee. Daughter is filling the filter completely full of grounds, that's a cup of grounds for a 24 oz tumbler. I ask her why, she tells me Lilly likes her coffee strong. I take her to the coffee pot and show her there's a ""regular and strong brew button, press the strong brew. Adding more grounds doesn't make it stronger. I don't know how to explain it other than this, when coloring frosting you add more to make it darker, but there's a limit to the darkness. Adding an entire tube doesn't make it darker, once it reaches the peak darkness there is no darker."" Eventually this all evolves to ""I'm not making dinner anymore because I'm tired of wasting my time and money."" Took months to reach this point just so you're aware. Whatever I made they wouldn't eat. They'd order DoorDash, UberEats or have take out when coming back home. So I made food for my Husband and I, that was it. Daughter and Lilly are buying their own food now, that includes coffee and creamer. 

Now during all of this happening I did try and bond with Lilly, like a friendship. She kinda kept her distance because she didn't know me and was intimidated. Still invited her to everything we did. She'd decline. Sometimes, most times, when I had the day off and the girls had to go to work they'd come home and straight to one of their bedrooms. Then I'd hear sobbing. Not crying, sobbing. It was terrifying at first. I didn't know wtf was happening. Both girls had really bad anxiety. The smallest thing would set them off. They cared too much about what other people thought and hated the idea of giving a bad impression or hurting someone's feelings. 

Side bar-I told Husband he had a month to help Daughter find some help. We aren't always going to be there and she needs to learn how to deal with her problems on her own. He didn't do it so I did. Got Daughter in touch with a place and she began counseling. So at this point Daughter was in counseling for about 10 months and she began to handle her mental stress load in healthier and solo ways. We all, Daughter, Husband and I, strongly suggested to Lilly she begin counseling or therapy for herself. She kept pushing it off and never went.

Back to the story, so whenever I'd come home from work and they had been home all day sometimes I'd come home to them both sobbing. I'd check on them and sometimes the answer I got would be ""we just really needed a session."" I get it. I watch videos or movies that I know will give me a cry because a good cry is needed sometimes. But sobbing? When I say sobbing I mean, 'My favorite person/pet passed away."" Eventually I stopped checking on them. If they don't wanna tell me why they're crying I'm not gonna force it. Sometimes when Husband got home he'd go check on them and spend awhile up there. 

There comes a day where the girls had asked to use my car the next morning. Sure I don't work, keys are on the table. Afternoon comes around and they still haven't left. Husband is relaxing before work, I decide to go to the store real quick. Daughter sees me leave, but doesn't ask me where and when I'll be back. When I get back Husband is getting dressed and the girls are waiting in the living room. I ask what's goin on because he still has time before he goes to work. Husband tells me after I left Daughter went back upstairs and straight to Lilly to tell her I had left with MY car. Lilly asks to take Husband's car. Husband just got that car, Adventure pack Rav4. Beast of a car. He says no. Lilly gets upset and says they have to go some where, husband tells her I'll be back soon. Lilly panics and says she has to leave now. I get back before he's even finished dressing. I get mad when he tells me all that. I let the girls take my car, ""we can talk when you get back"" situation. Before this there were hints that Lilly felt like my car was her car, but I dismissed them thinking I'm the delulu one. I wasn't. Husband goes to work, girls get back and we talk. It all comes down to me telling Lilly she had all morning and she didn't use my car like she said she would. So I go some where and that's when you finally want to use my car? I told her I felt like she felt entitled to my car. She denied it. So I reminded her it IS MY car, she access to MY car because I allow her to, but that doesn't mean it's her car to use at her convenience. When it came to the kids and teaching them boundaries I didn't hesitate. If they crossed one of my lines I told them in a healthy way. We talked and I explained why I wasn't okay with something and how to better handle the situations. They did the same with me. I encouraged it. 

Things with Lilly just kept getting worse and worse. I actually forget my husband lived with us. I felt alone. Closer to the end I considered locking my door at night while I slept because I was worried she'd harm or end me. I was even worried she'd harm my fur babies. Even considered therapy. I didn't go because I knew what I needed to do. We had been talking about moving for awhile, when Lilly moved in we told her we'd be moving the following year. So when we were about six months through the lease I began looking at places. Don't do that. There is no need to do that. You're just gonna find something you really like. Anyways, I talk to Husband tell him how I'm feeling, alone and unwelcome in my own house.  Lilly and I were fighting a lot. After every fight she'd ask if I hated her. I always said no because I didn't. She needed help, help that I couldn't provide and help she didn't want to get. I was sympathetic to what she was going through. Can't help someone that doesn't want to help themselves though. I can recognize a lost cause. I tell Husband I couldn't live with her anymore. That if he wanted to take Lilly with us during the move that I'd find my own apartment. My own inner peace and sanctuary of a home was more important to me than Lilly was. He told me he felt the same about Lilly and didn't want to bring her with us. Neither one of us wanted to tell her we didn't want her moving with us, Lilly was also trying to convince Daughter to move out with her. I discouraged that. I was beginning to realize Lilly was a leach. Daughter always had to be with her, do as she said. Lilly was isolating Daughter and I didn't like it. Even friendships can turn abusive. Without telling Daughter ""no"" I did my best to say it was a bad idea. ""That'll be really expensive. Stay with us and save money. How will you afford a car while paying all the other bills?"" 

So we had a hard conversation together, because up until then it was only me. I wanted her to know we were united on this. We talked to Lilly about her behavior and how we weren't okay with it. I grew up where talking wasn't talking, it was yelling. There is a reason I don't like certain things, it's linked to an event that always reminds me of that event. Daughter mentions she doesn't like the jokes Lilly makes about how she's going to end herself. Example, She does something stupid in traffic and says she's going to end herself now. We also tell her that if nothing changes we do not want her to move with us. Conversation does not go well. She thinks we hate her. She's crying. Husband is crying. Daughter is crying. I'm stoic as fuck. Still don't hate her, I just didn't feel anything for her anymore. Things got worse after that. 

I found a place for us and got so excited I convinced Husband to sign the lease without him having seen the property. Lilly doesn't know where it is. Daughter told her about it. This was in December we signed the lease on the new place, we had the lease with Lilly till May at the old place. We decided we could pay both leases, because the May one wasn't gonna let us out of it. Lilly and May were gonna stay at the old place together while Husband and I live in the new place alone. The day after Christmas everything explodes again. We had smaller explosions before this explosion, but this was the ""we're done"" explosion. Lilly and I were arguing about something. I think it had to do with the fact she hadn't seen the new place yet and wanted to know if she was moving with us or not. We had decided she wasn't going to before this. Daughter opened up and told us how she felt about Lilly, but Daughter wasn't sure how to end it. So we kept Lilly away from the new place.

Later that night Husband and I tell Lilly she isn't coming with us. She had thought things blew over and she was fine to come with us. I was firm and absolutely not. She has some kind of diss-association with the conversation. Kept repeating how she needed to go to the gym. We kept the conversation steered towards, ""No you're not coming with us. We've had enough of this behavior and we won't do it anymore."" She's still, ""can we talk about this later I need to go to the gym."" She leaves, Daughter goes with her. Husband has a bad feeling the entire time. We go get some fast food and as soon as we get back my phone rings.

I have always always always told the kids I don't care where you are or what time it is if you are unsafe and you don't want to be there anymore call me. Text me your location and call me. I will be there no questions asked. 

Phone rings and it's Daughter. I answer she's crying. We get back in the car, stay on the phone with Daughter the entire time. She's in the gym bathroom because Lilly is taking her anger out on Daughter. Lilly is putting the blame of the fall out on Daughter. We get to the gym, Husband goes inside to get Daughter. We get back to the house, set Daughter up in our room (we weren't sure when Lilly would be back and what mood she'd be in). Favorite pillow, here's the dogs, remote, lock the door; We're gonna smash our burgers and then we're packing some shit to leave. We had signed the lease already for the other place and had the go ahead to move. It's one thing to fight with me, it's another to go after my Daughter. I was cold. I was calm. I was dangerous. I don't remember how long we were in Daughter's room packing some stuff for her, when Lilly gets back. She goes straight to Daughter's bedroom door and opens the door, not very far because I was sitting in front of the door.   
Lilly says, ""Oh!"" She wasn't expecting that. She begins crying about how ""her best friend left her at the gym and she doesn't know why, what's going on? what's happening?"" Husband keeps responding to her. After a minute or two I just lean back and slowly shut the door on her. Tell Husband not to respond anymore because that's what she wants. So there we are, shut in our Daughters room packing her stuff while Lilly is crying about how she doesn't know what's going on and she's scared. She says, ""I brought Abby. Please talk to me Daughter, what's happening? I brought Abby."" Daughter stops, gets a panicked look on her face and  begins to repeat ""She brought Abby"". I get her focused on me and say, ""Nope. Focus, is this keep or throw away?"" We continue packing. Now we're focused on pajamas and what you can't do without tomorrow. We just wanna gtfo.

Lilly eventually goes away to her room with Abby. We load up Husband's car with Daughter, her stuff, all three fur babies and we head to the new house. We unpack at the new house, go back for our stuff and spend the night at the new place. No electric or heat yet, but we were done with Lilly. The next day Husband, Son and I go back to the house with a UHaul and pack up everything that is ours. Lilly's car (her Dad brought her her car a few months of living with us) was in the driveway so we thought she was home sleeping. We did it all quietly. We left Daughter at home because we didn't want Lilly to have an opportunity to get Daughter alone again. We get electric and water hooked up at the new place, move everything out of old place and into the new one. Leaving Lilly alone in the old house. I text Lilly she has until the end of January to move out. We didn't tell her where we were so she couldn't bother us. She doesn't respond to my ""out by Jan"" message. Lilly kept trying to guilt Daughter into talking to her again. Abby did the same. We let Daughter make up her own mind and make her own decisions about the situation with Lilly and Abby. She decided to not talk to Lilly anymore and made new socials without Lilly as a friend. 

I was proud of her for that. It was years till we saw Lilly again at a big box store. She works there and we shop there. I wanted to talk to her and see how she's doing, but I didn't and won't. My intention wasn't ever to hurt her, but I couldn't do it anymore for myself and then she took her anger out on my daughter. I was done. I know I wasn't perfect in all of it and I made mistakes. I apologized and do apologize when I do realize I messed up. I still think about Lilly and wonder how we could have done better for her, but as I said can't help anyone that can't help themselves. Daughter learned some valuable life lessons. She began being more assertive about her personal feelings and boundaries. She's grown so much and is doing so well. I couldn't be prouder.

I am writing this because I am way over my head. I have no idea what I’m dealing with or what to do about my situation. If anyone out there has information—any at all—I’d appreciate it. The facade of my life is in shambles. Even more than it was before.

In my early years, I had a charmed life on the outside looking in. I lived in a nice suburban neighborhood. A dad who was a lawyer. A stay-at-home mom and I always had  food on the table. On paper, it sounded like the perfect suburban family. Though, it all felt  hollow. Superficial. Insincere. 

Even though I grew up with two parents, the white picket fence, and went to one of the top school districts in the state of Naperville, Illinois. I never felt that I knew who my parents were. It seemed like we had the ideal American lifestyle. Emphasis on “seemed.” They fed me, bathed me, and took me to school. But they never comforted me when I cried. Never read me bedtime stories. They never hung my art on the fridge, even the ones I was proud of.

The real issue was my dad’s drinking.

I remember one instance, when I was five, It was fathers day and I wanted to get my dad something special. So, I decided toI draw a picture of my dad. It was a picture of us in front of our house. I worked for what seemed like hours on it. I redrew our house 30 times. Wasting a bunch of trees in the making. I dug through all of the crayon boxes that I could get my hands on, to find the perfect color needed for my dad’s sandy blonde hair and my platinum blonde hair. 
My dad was sitting at the kitchen table and sipping his morning coffee. I came downstairs with the picture in my hand. 

“Happy Fathers Day, dad!” I said excitedly.
He looked up from his paper. I held up the picture with a smile.
“Thanks” He said with a half hearted smile. 
He took the drawing and set it down to the side of the table. 
I mentally told myself he was just “busy” and he’d look at it later, until I came down for a snack and saw it in the trash can. I fought back tears. I couldn’t believe I worked so hard on something and he didn’t care.
I went into my room. Feeling the rage that I’m sure my dad felt daily, after the third of fourth shot he had. I picked up the water glass on my table and chucked it on the ground. I wasn’t even thinking about the consequences, until I heard my dad yell. “What the fuck was that?!” 
	I froze in fear and before I could react, I heard my dad’s heavy footsteps rushing up the stairs.
He stormed in, red in the face. He glanced down at the broken glass on the floor.
“What the hell is going on here? Breaking our stuff! That is unacceptable. You are the biggest disappointment I have ever had for a son. I wish we would have given you away!” He roared. 
I felt hot tears form in my eyes and fall down my face. 
“Don’t fucking cry! You are staying in your room for the rest of the night!” When he slammed the door, I heard him go downstairs. I threw myself on my bed and sobbed. I sobbed for what felt like hours. That was the day I decided to never express love or gratitude to him ever again.

Now that I’m older, I now know the definition of a highly functioning alcoholic. My dad. The moment he got home, he’d start throwing back bourbon like his life depended on it. By the seventh or eighth swig of Jim Beam, the yelling would start. The smallest mistake from me or my mom, He’d snap. Cursing. Insults. Rage.

Dad never hit us, but that didn’t make it easier. I eventually got used to it. I tried my best not to upset him. walking on eggshells whenever. I avoided eye contact and talked to him as much as I could.

Luckily, he wasn’t in my life for very long.

One night when I was in second grade, I was lying on the hardwood floor in the living room, drawing. My mom was making a pot roast for dinner. The smell made my mouth water. Even with her typical hollow expression. She was still an amazing cook. 

Now that I’m older, I recognize that look. The look of surrender. The kind you give when you’ve already died inside. Even before 

I peered at her through the kitchen doorway. I was sketching a picture of our family. I watched .
	
The moment was ruined when my dad stumbled in, already drunk. Wham. He slammed the door loudly, making my mom and I jump. Up until that  point, I never knew a door could sound violent. His thinning hair was a mess. His face, beet red with rage. 

He threw his jacket on the floor and barreled into the kitchen, not even glancing at me. He normally didn’t come home this drunk. Even though I knew he snuck sips at work.

My mom was tense.

“Phillip, what’s the matter?” she asked in a shaky voice

He didn’t answer. He shoved past her as if she was invisible and grabbed one of his usual poison. I watched as he frantically 

He took a huge swig from the bottle. That was slightly out of character, due to him usually getting a glass and some ice.

“Did something happen at work?” she asked again, more hesitantly this time.

Usually, he’d come home, pour a drink, sit in his recliner, and watch whatever game was on. My mom would bring him dinner without a word.

But this night was different.

“Phillip, talk to me,” she tried again, hesitantly.

He looked as if he was shaking with rage. “I can’t take another fucking second of this and your bulshit!” he roared, five inches from her face.
I was actually scared he was going to hit her this time. Instead, he hurled the bottle to the ground. It shattered into a sticky mess on the floor. Making a mess of both glass and alcohol . I flinched as it came crashing down.

My mom froze. She looked up at him, wide eyed. Terrified of what he’d do next.

But, instead of screaming more, he grabbed another bottle and stormed out the front door.

That was the last time I saw him.

The next morning, cops showed up at our door. My dad had driven his Ford Explorer off the road. No other cars or pedestrians were involved. They asked my mom to come identify the body. She made me stay home by myself. I mostly just drew in my sketchbook. Wasting time

When she returned, she looked emptier than I’d ever seen her. She had no tears in her eyes, no expression. I didn’t think her eyes could look any more empty, but they did. There was nothing behind her eyes. Any semblance of life was gone completely. She never recovered after that. There was nothing there. She wasn’t there anymore. 

About a month later, we found out my dad had been drowning in debt. There were at least five mailboxes full of bills.  My mom started working later hours at the hospital. She picked up any shifts she possibly could. Though she never caught up to the debt my dad buried us in. I barely saw her anymore. She always had dinner in the fridge for me. I have no idea where this debt came from. It seemed excessive to feed his alcoholism. She never talked about his debt. She just dealt with it.

Due to most of my dad’s debt going into collections. My mom and I were forced to move into a tiny apartment in a run-down part of Illinois.

My relationship with my mother fractured more every day. She got a job waitressing at some dive bar, doing anything to keep food on the table. She worked odd hours and left me home alone most nights. Now, I get a call from her maybe once a month. The conversations don’t last long. It feels like an obligation, not love.

The trauma stuck with me. I guess all trauma sticks with people who’ve been through it. Anger is apparently more inherent than I thought.

By the time I was fifteen, I was in juvie for whaling on a kid so bad, he needed reconstructive surgery. I got off easy with an eight month sentence, with only two years probation. Dropped out of high school at seventeen. Now I work full-time at one of the most pristine jobs, Walmart Manager. I  live in an even crappier apartment. I got my GED. I started working part time, just to get out of the house. The extra money also helped. As you can probably guess, my criminal record kept me from getting into college or getting a fancy desk job. I didn’t even like school and I knew college would never be in my grasps.

I moved out to an even crappier appointment at eighteen. It made my mom’s and I’s apartment look like a 5 star hotel.  I did what was needed to survive and keep a roof over my head. Reflecting now, I realize I am much more like my mom than I thought.  My life and hers just.. is. It has been for a while. Going through the motions of day to day life, but not “alive.” 
My only solace was art. The only way to escape this god forsaken world is in my sketches. I probably have over 50 sketch books full of my art. It is the only thing that is truly mine.
A few months ago, after a long day at work, I was waiting for my roommate Johnny to bring jumper cables. My battery died during my double shift. I left my dome light on, like an idiot. I was in a rush to get to work and I dropped my phone under the seat. I grabbed it and left without another thought.

Johnny, my roommate and I met in juvie. He was the one who showed me the ropes. He taught me what food not to eat and how to trade newbies for the good stuff.  He pointed out the kids to not mess with. He was already 

The moon was full and the lot was dead quiet. I leaned against my '98 Cavalier, smoking my third cigarette, while waiting for Johnny to bring jumper cables. We lived ten minutes away.

It had been two hours.

I checked my phone again. Nothing.

I swear, if that idiot passed out mid-WrestleMania, with a beer in one hand and a corndog in the other. He will be done for.

I was about to say screw it and walk home when a black Kia rolled up to the space next to me. Out stepped this big guy. In his late 40s, maybe?, He had a colorful tattoo sleeve. Though mismatched and seeming to have no pattern or reason behind it. They were placed like he got drunk at a biker bar and told the artist,""Surprise me.” To give a visual context, on one part of his arm he had an Alien, a cartoon looking gofer surrounded by tulips. It looked more wacky than cool. He had to be at least 6’1. He had at least one hundred pounds on me. He rubbed his burley beard as he strolled over to me.

“You okay, son? It’s awfully late to be hangin’ out at Walmart.” He said blankly.

I blinked. Trying to play it cool, I took another drag. “Car’s dead. Waiting on a jump from a buddy.”

He nodded, like he’d expected that answer. “Well, I got cables in the trunk. Want to use mine?”

I hesitated at first. Then I finally nodded. I mean who knows how long Johnny will take “Yeah. Thanks.” I was a bit nervous, since this guy could very easily come out with a pistol or machete. 

He strolled over to dig in the trunk of his car.

I relaxed once I saw him appear with the cables.

 The man  helped me attach the jumper cables to our cars and we stood in silence. I tried the car again after they were attached. Nothing. “Guess we’ll have to wait and see,” I thought.
 The man started tapping his foot in an antsy fashion. It seemed like the silence was uncomfortable to him. Though, I was used to the silence. The silence that a lot of people feel they have to fill.

	“Where are you from?”

“Naperville,” I said, sounding more uninterested than I meant to. I have never been one for small talk. 

“Nice area,” he muttered.
I started to feel bad. I didn’t really know what to say to this stranger. 
Luckily, he broke the silence.”You want to try the engine, again?”
I nodded and jumped in my car.
 I turned the key. The engine sputtered, then hummed. Relief washed over me.

“We let the cars sit for a bit longer, just in case”. That’s when he said it.
I  got back out of my car and  stood awkwardly next to him.

“You’ ever heard of the Windmill People?”

I squinted, already preparing to disengage. “No. Why?”

He tilted his head, like he was trying to read something written on my soul. “It’s jus… you seem”

HONK HONK HONNNNK.

Almost on cue Johnny pulled up.

His piece-of-crap, Corvette swerved into the parking lot like it had three wheels and a dream. The door flung open and out he came, stoned off his ass but still moving like he’d just been shot out of a cannon.

“BRO! Sorry! Sarah called me crying about, like—emotional mold or something, and I had to—wait, whoa, who’s this?” He pointed at the old man, then to the jumper cables like he was walking into a sting operation.

I didn’t bother hiding my irritation. “Since you took two hours, someone else helped.”

I turned my back to Johnny and faced the dude that helped me. 
“Thanks again,” I said, sticking out my hand.

“Terrence.”

“Evan.” I said, shaking his hand.

Johnny grinned. “Nice. Good Samaritan alert.” Johnny said, appearing next to the man.  “You're a good dude.. Thanks for saving my bestest boy.” 
He slapped my back with brute force. If I didn’t know him, I would’ve popped him in the face.  Though, since it was Johnny, I just rolled my eyes at his cheery attitude.

The man named Terrence, chuckled politely. “Well, now that your friend’s here, I’ll get going.” He seemed to appreciate Johnny’s enthusiasm.

After exchanging pleasantries. He made his way to his car and eventually made his way to his car, and drove off..

I turned to Johnny. I looked at him dead in the eyes. “What the fuck, man?”

He looked properly sheepish. “I know, I know. I suck. But I promise I’ll make it up to you, L.S.D. for a week?”

L.S.D. = Laundry, Supper, Dishes. It’s a dumb code we made up when we were fifteen. Don’t judge.

“Make it two. I have to open, tomorrow.”

He held up his hands like he’d been arrested. “Fair. Totally fair.”

I lit another cigarette. “Are you at least sober enough to follow me home?”

He jumped in excitement and gave me finger guns. “Sober? Never. Functional? Always!”

I rolled my eyes again and got in my car. As we drove away I pondered the question that Terrence asked me. 

The next few days were a blur. I barely slept. I lived off Monster’s and nicotine, just to stay awake. 

On my day off, I finally had a moment to breathe. 
I stayed in my room sketching a phoenix with colored charcoal. I sometimes do commission work if I get the chance. It helps me earn a little extra. 

Drawing has always been an escape. An escape from my dad’s belligerent yelling. From the constant ache of a neglected childhood. From my lifeless side-life.

I finished up the charcoal  section of the. Then, I realized that  I needed setting spray. I hadn’t used it in years, but I was sure I still had some buried in my closet. I reached for the top shelf and started pulling boxes down.

I opened a few. Found old Pokémon cards. Clothes that were too big for me. Most likely from my dad.  I dug through my old collection of old VHS tapes from when I was a kid. 
I paused when I saw one labeled “home videos” in black marker, scribbled on a strip of Scotch tape.

I paused, confused. I’d never seen this tape before.  My parents didn’t even have pictures of me in their house. So it’s fair to say that I definitely didn't know my parents had made home videos.

I debated if I should play the tape. I honestly didn't want to see my dad’s alcoholistic rage, even in tape form.  It’s not something I ever want to relive. However, curiosity got the better of me.

I slid the dusty VHS into the old TV in my room. I barely use the old thing. It’s the same one from my room when I was a kid. So definitely out dated.  When I moved out, I was in such a rush that I basically packed up all of my belongings into my car.

 On most free days, I usually  work on art and  listen to music or audiobooks. So upgrading my TV  was not at the top of my priority. 

The blue screen flickered, then shifted to grainy footage of my parents. I was shocked to see that she actually looked happy. Alive. She smiled in a way I never saw.  My dad looked pleasant and relaxed. He smiled and kissed my mom’s cheek. I have never seen my parents show affection to each other. 

As much as it was intended to be sweet. I found it disturbing. They’d never shown each other affection. Not once, not in front of me. I started to wonder if they’re unhappiness was because of me.


The footage glitched, then cut to a new recording.

My mom was talking to a man in our old backyard. The trees were lush and  her face was tight with distress. It was hard to make out the guy’s face because of the lighting and the old camera quality. The man wore a purple robe. completely out of place for late spring. He was holding something in his hands.

A baby?

I leaned forward, confused. I thought I had to be seeing things. Unfortunately, I was wrong.

The baby was me. I’m certain.

 I’d recognized the large brown birthmark on my shin. It resembled the shape of Italy. There was no doubt in my mind about it.

The man handed me to my mother. Then the camera cut off, abruptly.

And then the last clip began.

It’s the one that still keeps me up at night. Haunts my dreams. I don’t think the video will leave my mind anytime soon.

After the black and white static played, the screen flickered.  There were a group of people wearing dark purple robes and gold plague doctor masks. The people all stood in a circle. There were at least twenty people in the circle. This had to be some sort of ritual, but why on this tape? They were chanting something I couldn’t make out. Their words sounded guttural, rhythmic. Latin, maybe? I’ve never been good with languages, but it didn’t sound human.

The camera zoomed in. I could finally make out certain details that only were irrelevant blobs before. 

Standing in the center of the circle was a man in a crimson robe.

My dad. The footage zoomed in on him. I would know that stressed out, clammy face anywhere.

He looked exhausted. I watched him as his legs trembled under the weight of an unconscious woman. He held the woman in his arms. She had long dark hair. Her eyes were closed and her limbs dangled limply. Her skin was streaked with sweat and caked with dirt. She wore a white dress. It looked pristine, and untouched by the grime. The contrast made her look ghostly by comparison.

My dad carried her to the center, to what looked like a massive altar or anvil—but made of gold, etched with bizarre, curling symbols. He laid the woman across it.

Then, he raised a knife high above his head.

My breath hitched. I watched in horror. I wanted to look away, but I couldn’t. I sat there frozen. Just waiting for my dad's next move. 

He drove it into her chest. Deep. The blade disappeared in one brutal motion.

She didn’t even flinch.

The chanting grew louder, with even more fervor. The  woman's blood pooling out across the golden stone seemed to  fuel the enthusiasm of their energy. 

I sat frozen, staring at the screen. My mouth was agape and I sat completely still. Comprehending the snuff film I just saw. 

“Could this be fake?” I thought.

It didn’t seem like it. As far as I knew, my dad didn’t even own a camera. 

Plus, why would my dad go to all that trouble to video tape on his home video tapes?
 I turned off the TV.

But there’s one detail that I can’t forget. One that still makes my skin crawl whenever something triggers the memory.

The woman’s belly was enlarged.

Dawn broke over Deadfall Village as Aurum began its climb. Caleb stirred from sleep, his body moving before his mind caught up. Six weeks of routine had worn new grooves into his existence. The 28-hour cycle of Veraxus no longer felt odd. He'd grown accustomed to the extended daylight of Highsun, which allowed for grueling ten-hour sessions in the kitchen, and the eerie crimson glow of Second Dusk that followed. He barely even noticed the chiming of the hourly bells anymore. It was the rhythm of this life now—one that afforded more time for work, and, he hoped, work would be enough.

The aches remained, but they'd transformed—no longer the sharp protest of abused muscles, but the dull throb of a body shaped by honest effort. He swung his legs off the narrow cot without ceremony. The staff quarters were quiet and restful. Other shapes huddled in their beds, stealing precious minutes before the day's demands. Not Caleb. His internal clock, honed by decades of corporate punctuality, had adapted to this new pace.

The washbasin held yesterday's water, cold enough to shock the last wisps of sleep away. On its surface, a stranger stared back. The gaunt hollows of Thal's cheeks had filled out. Color bloomed where pallor once reigned. His arms and chest showed definition—actual muscle forged by endless hours of knife work.

In his old life, he'd spent a fortune on a gym membership he used three times, mostly to sit in the sauna. Here, a diet of reincarnation, manual labor and constant stress had given him the kind of muscle definition he'd only ever seen in men's health magazines. *Great. I'm finally thin. Fate sure knows how to crack a joke.*

He dressed in the dark with rehearsed silence. The newer shirt felt stiff; the trousers comfortable. Clean, whole, sufficient. Fingers finding laces and seams without a single fumble. Every motion was a well-worn groove. His old body had known the path to the coffee maker; this one knew the path from cot to clothes.

The kitchen welcomed him with residual warmth from banked fires and the ghost-scents of last night's service. His station waited, knife and board exactly where he'd left them. The blade sang as he ran it across the steel—three passes, fifteen degrees, the angle precise without thought.

His hands found their flow immediately. Onions first, always onions. The knife moved in precise arcs, each cut clean and sure. **\[Chopping (F)\] - Expert** wasn't just a notification anymore; it lived in his muscles, in the way his fingers curled to guide the blade.

A sprig of rosemary lay among the herbs for the morning's prep. He picked it up, crushing it between thumb and forefinger to release its oils. The aroma overwhelmed him, dragging memories with it.

Suddenly he stood in his old kitchen. Sunlight warmed the linoleum. Evelynn hummed off-key at the counter, wearing his college shirt with the hole in the shoulder. Her hands moved with casual confidence, seasoning the roast for Sunday dinner.

""Add more rosemary,"" she said without turning. ""You always go light on the herbs.""

Katie sat at the breakfast bar, supposedly doing homework but actually texting under her textbook. Jack had his earbuds in, bobbing his head to whatever noise passed for music these days. The scene was so complete, so achingly whole, that Caleb felt the sunshine's heat against his skin, tasted the coffee cooling in his Northwestern mug.

His knife faltered. The blade bit crooked, mangling the onion beneath. The vision broke apart, yanking him back to the kitchen with its stone walls and pale morning light slanting through high windows. His grip trembled, and the knife shook.

Caleb sighed.

He forced his hands back to work. The knife's beat became a mantra—*thump-thump-thump*—each impact an attempt to drown out her ghost.

*Get up, work, eat, sleep.* The thought tasted bitter as the herbs under his blade. *Build a new life that will never be as good as the one I lost. Is this it?*

The kitchen door banged open. Gareth entered with his usual economy of movement, already fixated on the day's battles.

""Thal."" The half-elf didn't look up, busying himself at his station. ""My cleaver. Needs an edge.""

Caleb set down his knife and crossed to Gareth's station. The cleaver lay dull on the block, its edge darkened by yesterday's work.

""Yes, chef.""

He wrapped the tool in oiled leather and slipped out the kitchen's back door. The morning air was cool as he traveled through the awakening Deadfall Village, carrying wood smoke and the eternal dampness of the Virethane Forest.

The forge squatted like a beast of brick and iron, already belching smoke into the grey sky. First bell had just rung out from the village watchtower, its deep bronze tone signaling the official start of the workday, and the forge's heat already rolled from its mouth in waves. The sweet smell of coal mixed with hot metal, and inside, the ring of hammer on steel created a percussive heartbeat that vibrated through the ground.

Yorrin worked his anvil with methodical strikes, shaping what might become a plow blade. The blacksmith embodied his craft—thick arms corded with muscle, leather apron scarred by decades of flying sparks. Each blow landed with the certainty of long practice.

Caleb waited at the counter. Better not to interrupt a craftsman mid-strike.

Eventually, Yorrin noticed him. The smith's eyes—pale grey, like cooling steel—swept over him with brief disdain.

""Yeah?""

""Gareth Hearthsong's cleaver."" Caleb unwrapped the blade, setting it on the scarred wood between them. ""Needs sharpening.""

Yorrin grunted, picking up the cleaver to examine its edge. His calloused fingers explored the blade, detecting each imperfection and curve.

""An insult to the steel. Leave it. Come back in an hour, *dull-ear*.""

The slur landed softly as everything else Yorrin said—no particular malice, just the casual dismissal of someone who'd never questioned the world's order. A simple fact: sky blue, water wet, half-breeds lesser.

Caleb's jaw tightened, but he nodded. ""One hour.""

He left the forge behind, its heat giving way to the cool morning. The main thoroughfare showed more signs of life now—merchants preparing their stalls, early customers haggling over prices. He kept to the center of the street, avoiding the alleys that opened like hungry mouths between buildings.

As he passed a tavern, the door swung open, spilling the smell of stale ale and unwashed bodies into the street. For a second, he caught the sharp, bitter scent of Steelbloom Brandy—the drink Rufan favored. A figure stumbled out, broad-shouldered and gaunt, and Caleb’s heart seized. It wasn't him. Just some other drunk starting his day early. Yet the abrupt insight left a frigid sensation in his gut. The threat wasn't gone. It was just waiting.

The Adventurer's Hall rose ahead, three stories of reinforced timber and ambition. Even at this hour, figures moved through its doors—some swagger-filled with success, others worn down by failure. The building hummed with an energy distinct from the forge's honest labor. This was the buzz of adrenaline and the desperate stink of final-bet sweat. It was the sound of coins clinking on wood—a down payment on either a fortune or a funeral.

The common room stretched before him, worn and chaotic. Tables bore the scars of daggers used to make points, floors stained by substances best not examined closely. Trophy heads watched from walls with glass eyes. A party of five argued over a map, their voices rising with each contested point about ""optimal approach vectors"" and ""aggro management.""

He crossed to the quartermaster's cage, where a semblance of order existed in defiance of the surrounding chaos. As he approached, he cataloged the unique feature that stood out on the patrons of this hall—the badges. Nearly every adventurer wore a badge—bronze or iron discs with emblems that glowed faintly. Bronze badges showed wisps of silver mist around a stamped tree. Iron badges held more substantial silver inlay.

His attention settled on the woman behind the reinforced counter, the clear center of this small island of efficiency. She was a half-elf, maybe in her late twenties—hard to tell when one had a bit of elven blood, he was learning—with dark brown hair pulled back in a severe, practical bun that allowed no stray strands to escape. Her fair skin had a light dusting of freckles across the bridge of her nose, and her sharp, intelligent brown eyes missed nothing, flicking from her ledger to a hulking adventurer and back again. Pinned to the collar of her vest was an iron badge, but the silver mist on hers was different. It swirled upward, enveloping the lower branches of the stamped tree in a silent, permanent fog.

Felicity looked up from her ledger, and her professional mask softened into something warmer. ""Thal. Good to see you."" Her voice carried educated precision, each syllable carefully placed. ""Let me guess—Gareth's special order?""

""Indeed.""

She turned to the cabinets, producing a tiny glass jar sealed with wax. A cluster of sunstone lichen flakes rested inside, each orange-gold sliver glowing with a soft, internal warmth. Despite its size, she handled it gently.

""One measure of Sunstone Lichen Flakes."" She slid it across the counter with practiced care. ""Do you know what the adventurer's went through for this?""

Caleb shook his head, though Thal's memories supplied fragments—something about a Lichen Lord, a creature of stone and fungus that moved like a glacier and hit like an avalanche.

""A full party tracked it for a week through the deep caves. Two of them came back with lung rot from the spores. Their mage is still coughing blood."" Her fingers drummed the counter—nervous energy seeking outlet. ""Sixteen gold imperials for one measure. Though...""

Her eyes flicked to the door, then back. Professional courtesy warred with personal interest.

""Between us? I could do fourteen. The party leader owes me a favor.""

Caleb's mind shifted gears, falling into patterns honed by years of vendor negotiations. **\[Haggling\]** might be the skill, but the instincts came from stressful procurement meetings.

""Twelve."" He kept his voice steady, reasonable. ""The Inn's a repeat customer. Consistent orders, always paid promptly.""

""Thirteen. The Guild takes its cut regardless.""

""Twelve and a half. Split the difference.""

She studied him, and something in her expression shifted. Approval, maybe. Or simple pleasure in haggling with someone who understood the exchange.

""Done."" She adjusted her ledger, making notations in precise script. ""I'll deduct it from the Hearthsong's account. You're getting better at this.""

Turns out, years of haggling with vendors over bulk pricing for networking infrastructure and enterprise software licenses had some real-world applications after all*. Who knew that arguing about a three percent discount on a million-dollar IT contract was the ideal training for saving a few silver on glowing fungus flakes? Evelynn would have gotten a kick out of that.*

Movement caught Caleb's eye. A man hunched at a nearby table, studying a marked-up map of the Virethane. One hand traced migration paths while the other fidgeted with a crude, beak-shaped lure. His leather armor bore scuffs and tears, but the hunting knife beside him shone with a flawless edge.

""Mosshide bear's been denning near the old creek,"" the man muttered. ""Should take a full party... but alone... a beast that old has to drop a stone! Five percent. Just need to feel the needle move.""

""Another stone-fiend,"" Felicity said, dropping her voice. Distaste flashed across her face. ""Jurgen there? He tracked for Silverscale Company for almost a decade. One of the best mundane scouts they had, sharp instincts.""

She tapped a finger on her ledger. ""Saved every copper he earned. Finally scraped enough together to Awaken a couple of years ago. That first taste of real power, after a lifetime of being powerless... it hooks deep in some men. He's forgotten all the skills that kept him alive for years. Now it's just about the numbers.""

""Taking risks?"" Caleb asked.

""Reckless ones. Any contract with a high formation chance, no matter how deadly. Last week? Nurse Log Basilisk, solo hunt. Returned with melted gear, medical debt, and nothing to show for it."" She shook her head. ""He'll die within the month. They all do once the status screen matters more than their own blood.""

After a final look at Jurgen, Caleb nodded to Felicity. ""Thanks.""

Caleb pocketed the lichen flakes, Jurgen's desperate words following him into the street. *An addiction.* Of course. He’d seen it in his old world—workaholics chasing promotions, traders chasing market highs. The thrill of the numbers. He made a quiet vow to himself. *That won't be me.* For him, Awakening wasn't about watching percentages tick up. It was about standing on his own two feet. It was about understanding this world's rules, from its runic doors to its strange magic. It was about competence, not a high score.

The sun had climbed higher, burning off the morning mist. Foot traffic thickened—farmers bringing produce, craftsmen opening shops, children darting between adults' legs in games of tag.

His **\[Athletics\]** skill served him well, turning what would have been stumbles into smooth recoveries. After weeks of errands, he'd learned every uneven cobblestone and mossy tripping hazard.

He passed the intersection where Gilded met Duskborn, the social divide marked by architecture as much as clothing. On one side, shops with glass windows and painted signs. On the other, simpler stalls with hand-lettered boards. At the corner, a woman in rough homespun kneeled to repair cobblestones, her movements mechanical with exhaustion.

A Gilded approached—silk robes pristine despite the dirty streets. He stepped around the working woman without acknowledgment, as if she were furniture. She didn't react, didn't even lift her eyes. Just kept working, hands raw from hard labor.

A sour heat rose in Caleb's throat. He watched the Gilded dismiss the woman completely. He felt his own feet carry him past, his silence a shield of safe anonymity.

This was the person this world was making him.

He knew the lesson well. It was written on his ribs by Narbok's boot and etched on his throat by the memory of Rufan's hands. Keep your head down. Don't make waves. Survive. But knowing the lesson didn't make the taste of it any less bitter.

The forge's heat welcomed him back. Yorrin had his cleaver ready, the edge now gleaming with fresh promise. The smith held it up to the light, showing off his work.

""Done.""

""How much?""

""Two silver.""

Caleb paid without haggling. He’d seen a merchant argue with Yorrin last week over the price of nails; the man’s cart was still sitting by the road with a busted axle. Some lessons were cheaper to learn by watching others pay the price.

He came back to the inn quickly. Through the automatic doors, past regulars claiming their spots, into the kitchen's bustle.

He returned Gareth's cleaver to its place and his own knife to his hand. The kitchen work claimed him once more. Vegetables surrendered to his blade in exact portions. His movements fluid, no thought required. Just the meditation of repetitive excellence.

Cassia appeared as lunch service wound down. She seldom ventured into the kitchen during rush times, but once the chaos subsided, it was fair territory.

""Thal? A moment?""

He followed her to the office, wiping his hands on his apron. Sunlight spilled through the narrow window, bathing her office in golden warmth. She'd been working on the books, ledgers spread across her desk in neat rows.

""The lichen flakes?""

He produced the pouch. She inspected the seal, then nodded approval.

""Excellent. And the price?""

""Twelve and a half gold.""

Her eyebrows rose. ""Felicity usually charges fourteen minimum.""

""We negotiated.""

""I see."" She made notations in her ledger, each figure precise. ""Well done. That's significant savings."" She set down her pen, fixing him with that evaluating stare he'd come to recognize. ""Let's see where you're at, shall we?""

She opened a different ledger—smaller, more personal. His name marked the top of a page in flowing script. Below, weeks of careful accounting. Three silver here, five silver there. Simple mathematics that somehow added up to possibility.

""With today's earnings and the bonus for the discount you secured..."" Her pen scratched across parchment, tallying sums. ""You're at ninety-five silver.""

He let out a relieved sigh. When had he last felt this? Not the hollow victories of quarterly reports or performance reviews, but something raw and real, earned with blistered hands and aching muscles. Accomplishment. Pride. The abstract goal he'd been crawling toward suddenly felt within reach.

Ninety-five silver. One gold was a hundred silver. Another day and he'd have enough for a basic spirit stone. The first step on whatever path this world offered.

""That's..."" Words failed him.

""Six weeks of hard work paying off."" Cassia's smile held maternal warmth. ""You should be proud.""

Pride. Such a simple word for such a complicated feeling. He'd rebuilt himself from nothing. Learned skills with supernatural speed, yes, but still through sweat and repetition. Earned every silver through actual labor, not corporate manipulation or borrowed authority.

This money was *his* in a way his old salary had never been.

""Thank you."" The words came out rougher than intended.

""You've earned it. Every bit."" She closed the ledger, but didn't dismiss him. ""I have another task before you return to the kitchen, if you're willing.""

""Of course.""

""A special delivery. Our most... particular client has ordered Dominion-style spiced quail. Gareth's outdone himself, but the meal must arrive hot."" She gestured to a wrapped package on her desk, aromatic steam still rising from specially treated cloth. ""The cloth will keep it preserved for plenty of time after it's removed from the inn. But if you're late..."" She shrugged eloquently.

""Aurelian?""

""You know of him?""

Thal's memory fragments and conversations overheard in the kitchen had painted a loose picture. A disgraced noble playing at redemption. An alchemist with pretensions and flexible ethics. Someone who paid well but demanded perfection.

""I know where his shop is.""

""Good. Be careful with the preservation cloth—it's quite expensive. And Thal?"" Her expression grew serious. ""Aurelian values promptness above all else. Don't dawdle.""

He took the package, the cloth warm against his palms. Six weeks ago, a self-heating, food-preserving magic cloth would have been a miracle worthy of a TED Talk. Now, it was just another piece of equipment for a delivery run. *It's amazing*, he thought with a flicker of grim humor, *how quickly even literal magic can become just another part of the job*. Just like the wonder of the first iPhone eventually gave way to the dread of answering emails at midnight.

Outside, afternoon had settled over the village like a comfortable blanket. The lunch rush had passed, leaving the streets in that peaceful lull before evening commerce. His route to the alchemist's shop was straightforward—down the main thoroughfare, left at the mossy fountain, through the small market square where vendors hawked ""fresh"" produce of dubious origin.

Caleb turned down a side street that led to Aurelian's shop. Somewhere behind those walls, an arrogant noble waited for his meal, ready to complain if the temperature dropped a degree.

Unfortunately, he recognized this train of thought. This was his old life in a new skin. Demanding clients. Unreasonable expectations. The endless dance of service and satisfaction. An old weariness settled over him, a quiet counterpoint to the pride he'd felt moments before. That feeling of accomplishment was real, earned with sweat and calluses, but this errand felt like a step backward. It was a piece of his old life reasserting itself in this new one.

His old doubts followed him like shadows. Get the promotion. Buy the house. Check every box. Now it was silver instead of dollars. Spirit stones instead of stock options. But the treadmill looked remarkably similar.

*Okay, ninety-five silver. A couple more days, and I'll have the stone. Then what? Back to chopping onions for the next demanding customer?*

He'd reached the cusp of his first goal. The summit was in sight.

He hoped he wasn't trading one cage for another.

1o2fqwn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o2fqwn,"First impressions on 33 fragrances, including Xerjoff, BeauFort London, Mancera & Montale","Started receiving more samples, so more first impressions for anyone who might be interested. If anyone is curious I purchased all the Xerjoff samples here in r/fragranceswap, whereas the BeauForts and the decants were from Ministry of Scent.

**Xerjoff**

• *1888* - Ambery and powdery, a bit floral in the air, makes me think of Vanilla Coke or some other soda like that. I smell a lot of ylang-ylang up close but I'm sensitive to it so it might be a me thing. Something about it makes me think of a scented candle. 8/10

• *Bouquet Ideale* - Some cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla in the air. Woody, floral, a bit spicy, this makes me think of the winter and the holidays. I would have expected a fragrance called ""bouquet"" to be floral but I'm not complaining. 8/10

• *Casafutura* - Aromatic and citrusy in the air, a touch of spices. A lot of geranium up close. I don't get why it has such a low score in Fragrantica. 8/10

• *Dama Bianca* - Florals and vanilla, something a bit fruity and green, very nice, I do picture a woman in white. One of my aunts wears a fragrance that's very similar to this so it smells very familiar to me. 8/10

• *Fiero* - Immediately a classic gentleman's fragrance, citrusy, floral, vetiver and some spices. The citruses here are a bit acidic/salty but it smells nice. Probably for someone older than me, I bet my grandfather would love this. 7.5/10

• *Fiore d'Ulivo* - A bit citrusy but very airy and clean, almost transparent smelling. Floral and green, smells like you just walked out of the shower. 8/10

• *Italica* - Soft vanilla and almond in the air, smells just like vanilla ice cream. A lot of toffee up close, this is a great gourmand. My sister might like this one a lot. 8/10

• *La Tosca* - Violet and some eucalyptus and citruses in the air. There's something fleeting here that makes it smell like fabric, kind of like linen. Very musky and with a white florals-like finish to it up close. Nice but not my cup of tea. 7/10

• *Lira* - Vanillic, some cinnamon and a bit bubblegummy in the air. Vanilla, caramel and cinnamon with slight citrus and aromatic undertones up close. Smells great, I see why this is as liked as it is. 8/10

I've tried Mefisto before, it's in my previous first impressions post.

• *Ivory Route* - Smells like cinnamon and sandalwood in the air, reminds me of stuff like Danaë from Argos. There's a slight freshness from the basil up close but not much. I see why this might remind people of African Leather but they're not that similar at all, it reminds me a lot more of Danaë like I said. 8/10

• *More Than Words* - Very fruity oud scent in the air. Medicinal, clay-like oud, a bit syrupy and spicy, and some muskiness from what they say is ambergris. Not sure if I like it, the oud's ""texture"" with the syrupiness comes off strange to my nose. 6.5/10

• *Hayat* - Full bodied oud and cypriol, with a slight aromatic lavender in the back, maybe a bit of saffron and orange too? Nice oud scent, not barnyardy at all. 8/10

• *Alexandria II Anniversary* - The oud is much more prominent than in the og Alexandria II, which I like a lot. The combination of all the notes kind of smells like chocolatey coffee to me, this smells kind of gourmand in my opinion. 8/10

• *Al-Khatt* - Jasmine and benzoin in the air, very likeable. I get a lot of jasmine, benzoin and vanilla, the oud is kind of in the back adding some earthiness to the scent. I like this too. 8/10

• *Uden Overdose* - This smells amazing in the air. I can't describe it, it's a touch citrusy and invigorating. Up close it's very ambery, has plenty of ginger and the tobacco blossom adds an awesome white floral aspect to this. It's reminding me a lot of another fragrance but I'm not sure which. 9/10

• *Sketchbook P.33* - I get Amyris Homme vibes from this for some reason. Definitely apple, iris and cinnamon here, it smells clean and very nice. 8.5/10

• *Ouverture* - Smells like fig, cinnamon and orange in the air. Same up close but with some ylang-ylang, jasmine and sandalwood. Nice but not my cup of tea. 7/10

• *Decas* - Kind of bubblegummy in the air, I think it's the opoponax giving off this effect. Definitely mandarin, tuberose and some resins but something here smells a bit off. I like it overall though. 7.5/10

**BeauFort London**

• *Coeur De Noir* - Smells spicy and dry in the air, like an unsweetened Interlude Man. Inky and dry, a bit leathery and with just a touch of vanilla and rum to sweeten it. It becomes much sweeter after a few minutes and the dryness is pretty much completely gone. Very interesting. 8.5/10

• *Fathom V* - Green and floral in the air, smells clean and fresh, like you smelled flowers in a field that still have some dew on them. Up close it's also fruity and mossy but the green and floral aspects are still the most prominent facets here. Not my style of fragrance but it's undoubtedly very well made. 8/10

• *Lignum Vitae* - Sweet but also salty and lemony in the air, it reminds me a lot of some lemon flavored cookies we have here in Mexico. Smells even more like a cookie up close, this is kind of an odd citrus gourmand. It smells good though. 8/10

• *Tonnerre* - Smokey gunpowder and lime in the air, very strange and not too pleasant. I can see the marine aspect, maybe a touch of booze but overall this is just gunpowder and lemon, it's not rɛally palatable or likeable. It starts to dry into a very metallic and peppery lime scent. 4/10

• *Vi Et Armis* - Dry and smokey birch and tobacco, a slight hint of booze in the back and a very strong green medicinal smell from what I assume is the ""opium"" note (smells an awful lot like peyote). I get some tea and pepper up close, for some reason it makes me think of eating white rice with soy sauce. Strange and while not too likeable it's definitely better than Tonnerre. 5/10

• *Cape Wrath* - Smells fresh, floral, musky and a bit salty in the air, it reminds me slightly of Creed's Himalaya. Up close I can definitely smell the seaweed, and oddly enough the combination of it with the florals smell a bit like beets. It's a nice aromatic scent, but I'll have to see how it dries down. 7/10

• *Pyroclasm* - Very mineralic and peppery in the air, it smells like Tonnerre's gunpowder note again. Up close it's spicy, woody and with a fair amount of vetiver, maybe even a touch of churchey frankincense. Not a big fan but I like it a lot more than Tonnerre. The thing is a fragrance like this doesn't go with my personality at all, this smells like a burly middle aged sailor after a day of work. 6/10

• *The Grudge* - Soft and marine in the air. Doesn't smell like much at all, it smells like rubbing alcohol but it has a medicinal character. I'll have to try this on skin. No score

• *Absent Presence* - Smells very familiar but I can't pin down which fragrance it reminds me of. It's woody, sweet and a touch floral. Probably the safest of all the BeauForts. 8.5/10

• *Acrasia* - Rosey and citrusy, smells like candy in the air. It's a bit weird with its sweetness, a bit syrupy and with a noticeable cinnamon. One of the most unique sweet fragrances I've smelled but not necessarily one I like too much on first impressions. I like it more dried down on paper. 7.5/10

• *Iron Duke* - Much better than I expected, I get a lot of tobacco and rum despite people voting for leather and gunpowder being more prominent. It has a slight medicinal edge to its sweetness but I think it works. Leather fragrances usually smell very little to nothing like leather on paper so I'll have to try this on skin but I like it a lot as it is now. The gunpowder starts coming out after a bit and it has a slight citrusy edge to it, very much like in Tonnerre but in tolerable amounts. 9/10

• *Rake & Ruin* - Smokey and green, but very dry and spicy, almost like a spice cupboard with oregano and peppers. Up close it's still very green, smokey and harsh, almost like a combination of both Cape Wrath and Pyroclasm. Not a fan. 5/10

• *Terror & Magnificence* - Resinous tobacco and saffron, a bit sweet. I like this one a lot too. 9/10

Although there were some BeauForts I didn't like at all I think it's a very interesting niche house. It's unique in the sense that all their scents have cohesion between them, in the same way you can tell a Tom Ford is a Tom Ford just by smelling it, they have a distinctive nature to them all except for maybe Absent Presence and Acrasia, which are ""safer"" fragrances. I'll keep an eye out for whenever Ministry of Scent stocks up the new Sirenide, as I think I might like that one.

**Mancera Red Tobacco** - Strong, a lot of saffron, cinnamon, vanilla, patchouli and a hint of tobacco in the air. This isn't as harsh as people make it out to be, it just smells ""dense"", like a literal wall of fragrance. I like this a lot, and in a spectrum this is like the exact middle ground between Carlisle and Triumph of Bacchus. Looking forward to trying this more. 9/10

**Montale Arabians Tonka** - Very sugary rose in the air, but surprisingly it's not jammy. Loads of tonka (obviously) and rose with a synthetic, medicinal oud hiding in the back. Thought it would be stronger but I also did just one spray in case it was too strong. I guess I can see why people like this. It's also reminding me a lot of Angels' Share after it has dried on paper. 8/10

These two being the first Montale and Mancera fragrances I've tried left a good impression on me, I'll look into trying out more.

I still have plenty more samples on the way from brands I haven't tried before like Atkinsons, Tiziana Terenzi and d'Annam, as well as way more Xerjoffs, the new PDM Extraits, the new Tom Ford Oud Voyager, among other stuff.",3,1760039029.0,Colognes,0,1.0,False

New job, better apartment, more plans. I was always busy, always trying to make the next thing happen.

Then one random morning, I walked past this older guy in my neighborhood. Every day, he’s outside watering his plants, just humming to himself. One day I stopped to say hi, and we ended up talking. He told me, If you don’t make time to enjoy what you already have, you’ll never enjoy what you get next.

That line has been stuck in my head ever since.

Now I try to do small things differently I drink my coffee without my phone, I take short walks after work, I text friends just to check in instead of waiting for a reason. Nothing big. But somehow everything feels lighter.

It’s weird how slowing down can actually make life feel fuller.

Im trying to find a great beginner friendly yerba. Ive been trying to find a good coffee alternative so I bought a cheap mate and bombilla off of shopee (PH version of Amazon) and Pipore because it's the cheapest. So far im loving it! I've been drinking it for a few days with cold juice while studying and my leaves are almost gone. 

Should i go for more premium yerbas like playadito and cruz de malta or should i stick with pipore? I didnt mind the bitterness since I've played with chinese teas for a bit but i think i would want something easier on the tongue but packs more flavor than chinese black tea.

What's the difference between the taste profile of playadito and cruz de malta?

Why not get both you ask? Its too expensive for a broke, unemployed, fresh grad like me; studying to get my license.

1o2fhbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1o2fhbf/explore_the_aquasana_aqcwm2r_replacement_water/,"Explore the Aquasana AQ-CWM2-R Replacement Water Filter Review for Cleaner, Safer Water","The **Aquasana AQ-CWM2-R Replacement Filter Cartridge** for the Clean Water Machine has been sitting on my kitchen counter for well over a month now, and I have no regrets about giving it a run in my household. As someone who relies heavily on filtered water to avoid the weird taste of chlorine in tap water (not to mention to keep my coffee tasting on point), this water filter noticeably delivers on its promises. Having tested it daily, my impressions are a mix of admiration for its standout features and a few observations on areas where it could improve.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of this filter cartridge screams practicality. Weighing about 14.88 ounces and compact with dimensions of 2.1 x 2.1 x 5.5 inches, it slots effortlessly into the countertop Clean Water Machine without any wiggle room. Made with carbon block material, the filters stand up to regular use, which is key when you’re chugging water like it’s your full-time job. There’s a no-nonsense feel to the way it’s constructed—it’s clearly built for function more than form, but that’s fine. After all, it sits tucked inside the dispenser most of the time. The installation process is wonderfully straightforward—I’d describe it as a “replace-and-forget” setup that doesn’t require you to pull out your homeowner’s manual or call a plumber.

**Key Benefits**  
- **WQA Certification confirms trust**: Knowing the filter meets rigorous water quality standards is definitely reassuring.   
- **Big on chlorine and contaminant reduction**: It effectively reduces chlorine and a whopping 78 contaminants (like lead), leaving the water tasting crisp and clean.  
- **Long-lasting cartridge life**: Each unit handles up to 300 gallons, which, in my busy house, goes for around three months before I need to replace it.   
- **Hassle-free maintenance**: The ease of swapping out old cartridges means less time fiddling and more time drinking.  

[Check Aquasana AQ-CWM2-R price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b07mjstrzq/)

**Performance and Filtration Capabilities**  
The standout strength? Its ability to filter 15 times more contaminants than leading pitcher filters! From personal experience, the taste and smell of the water improved immediately, and my family started noticing that even tea tasted better. Given its WQA certification, there’s peace of mind that what you’re drinking is safer and cleaner. Plus, there’s no funny aftertaste, which is often a downside with budget filters.  

While it’s great for improving the taste and odor of water, I felt that it does perform best in a city-living scenario. If you’re in a rural area with well water, this may not address extreme hard water issues or complex contaminants—you’d need a more heavy-duty system for that.

**Downsides**  
- **Doesn’t handle well water complexities**: It’s best suited for municipal water sources rather than untreated water.  
- **Requires a compatible dispenser**: If you don’t already use the Clean Water Machine, this filter won’t be of much use.  
- **Single-purpose design**: It only fits the countertop dispenser system, unlike some generalized universal filters.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
Competing water filter cartridges like the Brita Longlast and PUR filters immediately come to mind as alternatives. While both Brita and PUR are widely recognized, they don’t come close to the contaminant range that this system covers (300 gallons vs Brita’s 120 and PUR’s 100 gallons of filtering). However, the Brita filters slide ahead when it comes to availability and compatibility with various water pitchers. If you’re someone who prefers portability, Brita might be the go-to option. On the other hand, Aquasana blows competitors out of the water in specialized filtration efficiency and cartridge lifespan, though this comes with its limitation of relying exclusively on the Clean Water Machine.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering how long each cartridge lasts, I’d say the Aquasana AQ-CWM2-R is a solid choice if you’re after better filtration at a reasonable cost. It might seem like more of an investment upfront, but the fact it filters significantly more water means fewer replacements, and in the long run, it’s easy on the wallet. Sure, budget filters like PUR or Brita might seem cheaper initially, but if they need replacement twice as often, are they truly saving you money? For anyone prioritizing durability alongside water taste improvements, this is a worthwhile purchase.

Hey, guys!
So, I was born and raised in a small town in the south of Minas Gerais - state of Brazil, where the local economy is based on coffee production, roasting, and export. I graduated this year as a Computer Technician and also completed high school at the Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology, earning an academic merit honor.

I was also accepted in first place for the Electronics Engineering program at one of the most traditional federal universities in Brazil, but I decided to not go by now.

Currently, I work in the mornings at our family’s coffee warehouse, where I taste and classify coffee for the most part of the time; in the afternoons, I study (mathematics, physics and chemistry) and at night, I hit the gym and train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

That’s a quick summary of my life and routine, feel free to AMA!!! 😁

So we have known each other for quite a while. We went to same high school, but different uni and kept occasionally in touch by meeting each other for coffee during semester breaks. Once i visited them and stayed over at their place because i needed to see my best friend but their boyfriend was staying so i had no place and was thought i could visit while im at it. 

It was a tough time for me as i was going thru a lot of changes and i was very vulnerable. At that point we were close but nothing had gotten too emotionally serious. But they comforted me and that stuck a lot with me. We would keep in contact more often, texting, calling, video calling and while i was still going thru the lows i found comfort and i started to catch feelings. 

Well i thought it was a silly crush but it didnt go away and in order to not feel guilty, i was contemplating over telling them but the fear of ruining the friendship was still there. But i did, i felt better, this person rejected me but im glad they were nice and honest abt it, which was understandable and i didnt have hope they'd recipricate anyway. 

Now, we talk even more with constant texts of random updates and sometimes videocalling, but some of the messages and even when we call its for hours which is sth we would do usually. But idk, its making me feel wack. i know they said no and ofc i respect their decision and i know i shouldnt think of it as them leading me on. Esp when on some days theyre just radiosilent of leaving my texts seen and this is even worse than the anxiety i felt when i was trying to keep my feelings to myself. I am hoping i start to meet new people soon in a romantic way, its just that well i have a tendency that they need to be my best friend first before i have a crush on them :))))

We're looking for a 4-night group cruise between Sept-Oct 2026, but it could be in 2027. 

  
The problem is that I've never booked a cruise myself and I'm aware this is a tall order. I want to know any and all advice you'd have for booking a cruise like this. I looked at Costco travel, cruise compete, and other travel sites but I'm not sure if it's just better to book with a travel agent, direct on the website, submit a group form, or any other option out there. I know this is a lot but I want to maximize my money and save as much as I can. 

Please don't tell me if this is impossible, I am trying my best to make it work lol

**Prompt: A Yotul makes a blog reviewing and rating what sharing a bed with different species for a night is like. From preparing for bed, to getting comfy together, to sleeping, and to getting up and ready in the morning (or equivalent, if they visit VP/Skalga). Write a few entries, and maybe even the comments sections as well.**


**Species selection is fully up to the author, but if suggestions are needed, I suspect that Gojid, Drezjin, and of course Human would be interesting picks.**


Pouch written on the human-based InterGalactic Website known as PressWord.zorg, the Wowed Napper reviews have been one of the few stable xeno-written blogs in the last few years. The blogger is a female Yotul named Herda, who started as a review blog about different species' beds but gradually shifted focus to what it would be like to sleep with various members of different species. Not in a sexual way—if that were the case, we wouldn't be featuring them in the Blogies—but rather on the everyday life involved in trying to make a cross-species relationship work. Sleeping together, getting ready for work, and the small moments of daily life in such relationships, regardless of who has what. This is why I am nominating WoW Nap Review for Blog of the Year.


\-Steven Harden, one of the Committee members of the Bloggy Awards 


**Wow, Nap review date: Oct 21, 2151, entry 24: of Drezjin wings and Yotul pouches.**


Hello, critters of the secweb! It's Herda, and I'm back with another great blog post about napping with that special someone and comparing how different species rest together. I know I haven't posted in a while, but I do this more for myself now than for any audience. This isn't really a multi-species furniture review blog anymore; it's more about what it's like to sleep, wake up, and get ready for the day with a partner or friend of a different species. I found that part more fun to write, anyway. Besides, it was a pain dealing with my Venlil ex, Duru—being stuck on the Venlil homeworld for the past few months, acting as a witness for his illegal online activities. Still surprised he was smuggling that much human Methamphetamine by having his zurilluan friends hide it inside people to other worlds and sell it on the black market—sicko. I'm just glad he's rotting in a PD center, sorry, I mean a correctional facility for the mentally deprived. Still, he won't see daylight for a long time afterward.

So, anyway, onto the review. Today, I want to talk about my former boyfriend Siyp the Drezjin and how our nights of swipe went with him. We met in Fed anno, on my therapist's recommendation. You can find the full story here \[blog 12; sivkit chewing sofas and chairs\], but my family owned a Hensa breeding farm when the federation made first contact… burned all the kennels to the ground with my mother still inside, and my dad was held off in a PD center and died during a routine lobotomy. I was taken by Krakoti Foster care to have the Primitiveness pecked, slammed, and outright beaten out of me. Siyp was always questioning things and wanted to be a biologist growing up, instead of joining the colony’s antimatter terraforming business like the rest of them. So, he was forced to sleep outside the cave condo and nearly got eaten by large owl-like birds, known as nightflapers, which had wing membranes slashed. He was also forced to walk on the ground at one point.

We started talking by the coffee pot, and since his lease was ending soon, I decided to let him move in with me for a while. The dating naturally fell into place after that.

So, with that intro out of the way, onto the review.

**Sleeping; 1.5 out of five; size fears and awakening need for pouch rides.**


So, as much as I would have liked him to use the Drezjin resting poles that my former sponsor gave me—since I had made a lot of Drezjin friends—I felt like I should at least try sharing a bed if I wanted to make this work. I gotta say, have you ever had that feeling like you need to be more aware when you decide to take a newborn pop in your arms and fall asleep with the Joey in your hands instead of your pouch? Your motherly instincts kick in, and they keep you awake so you don’t crush your child. Yeah, imagine something similar with Drezjin, especially since I’ve heard panic screeches and even a few sharp bites when I accidentally rolled onto Siyp’s wing, or worse, his body.

We had to talk this out and try letting him sleep in my pouch, seeing that man was as he put it “the runt of his pup mates” and surprisingly, he fit. Having him in my pouch just made it easier to be aware of where Siyp was while we turned in for the night. Knowing there was a living creature in me (not in that way, you pervs) helped a lot.

I got comfortable with having him in my pouch all the time. I used him as an excuse to park in the carrying mother’s spot at the grocery store, but still, there were times I’d wake up, go take a shower, and he’d pop right out in a panic, forgetting he was there. Come to think of it, at some point he liked spending more time riding in the pouch than interacting with Me. Heck, by the end, a lot of times the Drezjin would pop himself into the pouch and hiss and bite if I tried to force him out. Leading us to…


**The morning after; one out of five: “everything is too big!”** 

That's what I would hear from halfway across the apartment, as the winged mammal, no bigger than my forearm, struggled to open the bathroom door, the refrigerator, turn the shower on and off, and flush the waste can. Yes, I installed aids designed to help smaller species move around my home but never learned how to use them. He would just whine at me from my pouch as we got ready together. It made everything so annoying and awkward. Also, can someone confirm if Drezjin are a cured species or not? Every time he bit me, I bled for hours, like I had to throw away so many towels and use countless bandages to stop the bleeding after getting scratched on the sofa or fighting in our bedroom. Damn, I had to throw both of them out because no one would go near the bloody stains! The winged mammal also seems to have an uncanny sense of where to bite to hit the most painful spots, which leads to… 


**Every day interactions- one out of five; emotional manipulation, playing the victim and the squid-fed gods.**


It felt like I was living with my adopted family again—never taking responsibility for anything, always playing up the difference in size and how tough it is to live a normal life “in a land full of giants,” especially after they used me as a chew toy. It wasn't until near the end of the relationship that I discovered he wasn't even genuinely homeless or fully disowned.

I overheard him one night when he stayed up late, thinking I was asleep. The little winged bastard was mocking my primitive self and the struggles I went through with my creepy squid-frog foster parents. He said I should be grateful that living gods were kind enough to even consider taking in a “lonely primitive” like me.

They were mocking all the stories I told the therapy group—how my father would look me in the eyes and throw ration packs behind me when we went on date nights, or how my mother would wipe me with her tentacles if I refused to attend Federation appreciation parades.

I stormed up to the fanged freak, grabbed him, and threw him out the window, then started tossing everything Siyp owned out after him. He’s been trying to call me for days, trying to explain that it was an act—that he still needed his family's financial support—which quickly turned into hundreds of harassing calls, punctured car tires, and my pet Hensa being malted by what could only have been a swarm of drezjin from the bleeding.

**WoW Nap review date Nov, 21, 2152 entry 36: in every arxur, there are two swamp puppers**


Hello interwebs, Herda here. I feel like I've finally picked myself up after the Gojid ex got the clear message that I didn’t want to move to the new cradle or his mother's place, for that matter. Still, I wish Boni paid for all the furniture he ruined with spikes, but getting him out of the basement after declaring squatters' rights was a pain and a half in its own right.


This next review will likely be seen as controversial, if not scandalous, but I finally got to nap with an arxur—two, in fact! I met them at the arxur embassy, which is in the old embassy district mostly because many embassies moved to the new embassy district of the capital. This happened because a lot of people didn’t like having their own ambassadors “at risk of being eaten” or some bullshit like that. I work as a freelance IT tech support, and based on the contract details, I’m making a pretty good amount from the ""brave herbivore” bonus. 


While there, I ended up being asked out by one of the two door guards, Visk. At the bar, I was joined by his twin brother, Krik. He never lets Visk wander out of his scent or sight, as unlike Krik, Visk is a bit more sensitive than what an arxur should be. Still, I managed to get along with them pretty well. So much so that Krik outright told me that if I wanted a relationship with Visk, I needed to be open to having him in the relationship too.


So that is how I ended up in my second polycule, now onto the review.


 **Sleeping; 4 out of 5; stuck in a warm Sandwich**


At first, during the few nights I spent in the Embassy Bunk apartment, I thought the warmth came from the apartment itself, but arxur are naturally warm-blooded. Something about their size makes it possible for them to generate their own body heat, or so it seems. Having them between me was surprisingly comforting. Two warm, smooth-scaled lizards forming a protective wall of muscle, claws, and fangs.


They never made me feel like I was in danger, despite Krik’s antisocial snaps from time to time; he seems to care, willing to share the bed with me and Visk. Plus, there are times when Visk decides to pull me closer to him, tightly. He had some bad experiences with his folks’ parenting style, being the “borderline defective” twin. Krik seems able to smell the duress almost instantly and loosens Visk’s grip on me when his clawed hands press my chest into his belly too tightly, or when my tail gets pulled between his calves.


**The morning after: 3.5 out of 5 flashes of warmth and cold.**


Despite being up to their hips, apparently, all of the Arxur’s Bucker apartments are built to have stands, adjustable sinks, and other amenities for mixed-species cohabitation. At least everything is made a lot more tail-friendly than the human embassy there. Guess I'm not the only contractor who found themselves living with one of the troops. Krik isn't very sociable when waking up; he ends up guiding me around the apartment as the three of us get ready, accompanied by bellows, snout clicks, and polite grunts of “please don't get in my way.”

His brother has a much warmer demeanor by miles, as Visk would lick me awake, just like how my Hensa used to—before the god grain thief had him put down at a fed-sympathizing veterinarian—making the decision to move much easier. Despite both of them and the neighboring units hating it, he would cook me vegetarian breakfast items on a hot plate he creatively borrowed from the Human embassy. Always willing to compliment me on my smell and always finding new fur shampoos for me to try.

So it was a mixed bag, but they both had the morning (graveyard) shift, when most of the other Arxur in the embassy are asleep. This explains the blackout curtains and the use of a red-tinted flashlight to navigate the apartment.

**Everyday interactions: 3 out of 5 in spite of the flaws, it never fully out waighted the good**

Dating two arxur with wildly different personalities can feel like whiplash in many situations. Let's start with Visk, a stuffed earth bear, who is always willing to hug and snuggle. He's much more extroverted than other arxur I've met, though I have only met about five so far. He's willing to attend plays, talk about how our days have gone, and is always a shoulder to cry on. The man knows how to paint landscapes, and on his days off, he hikes up to the hills to paint. Detailing how the moonlight shined over the trees and the busy night life of the capital. Guarding isn't his true calling, as he doesn't have a mean bone in his body. 

I remember going to a cafe in Diplomat Plaza, and exterminators showed up. Now, this is Leirn, yes, and they have lost a lot of power since joining the SC. Our police force makes us verify everything to ensure it's legitimate; we can't really have flamethrowers anymore. Heck, you can send a letter to their office once a year, saying that ""under no circumstance is anyone affiliated or working for the exterminators Guild allowed on the premises at any time."" Though I usually use more colorful language than that. 

Immediately, this silver-suited dossur jumped onto our table, pulling out a small-caliber hand cannon from how she was holding it, and kicked over my Visk blood tea and Cricket biscuits. The little runt was telling me they were looking for an arxur matching his description for eating the visiting Queen Of London’s dog or some shit, and needed to take him into custody. The other two exterminators, a fed-brained yotul and a mazic, were already moving to cuff and muzzle Visk as he started to cry.

So, I gave them my unfiltered opinion by chucking the dussur out the window and emphasized my point by grabbing the pull-out pistol the dussur had taken earlier and shooting the two rounds into the traitor's knees.

I was overwhelmed by the 600-pound mazic tackling me into everything in the café. The last thing I remember is feeling something very hot on my snout as a huge mass descended upon me.

As for Visk, from what the arresting officer told me in custody, he did end up hucking out after seeing me get waterboarded with hot coffee, and ended up shoving the big elephant-like woman's trunk right up the spout after ripping it clean off. She must be thanking the gods that we have socialized healthcare.

Krik is the standard arxur, very introverted, not very good at expressing himself, and “not really having a need for emotions like you leaf lickers.” Despite the snaps, he did a good job of showing he cared in other ways. We would have technical talks over text, which he seems more comfortable with than face-to-face interactions. Turns out he is very interested in video games and was trying to figure out how to get into coding.

In fact, he owns a ton of Terran and post-collapse board games and would host board game nights. For the lack of time spent in person, he made up for it online. Heck, he was the one who bailed us out of jail, and laughed when he found out I was on a first-name basis with most of the staff there. Yes, half of the interactions written in my blogs do end with violent altercations with local law enforcement, if you are new please read the rest of my posts.

Sadly, this relationship wasn't meant to last; they received orders requiring them to return home for training exercises. From Visk’s body language, I sensed it was something much worse. The brothers decided to end the relationship since they didn’t know if they would ever return, and Wriss wasn’t a place for someone like me yet. They helped me find a new place afterward, but what hurt most was that six months ago, the Arxur ambassador called me into his office and said the pair had died during their “training exercise.” At least I was given Visk’s paintings and Krik’s prototype game we were working on. I hope the fire-god lights your way to the afterlife.

**Wow, Nap review date 2055 entry 56: meeting my human exchange partner** 



As I celebrate my 32nd birthday today, I've been participating in the human exchange program. I know that in recent years, humanity and Yotul haven't been the closest politically, but surprisingly, the exchange program wasn't cut off like some technocrats wanted, so I signed up a few months ago. I have to say, I never thought Stephen Harden would be so perfect. So, when I found out he was going to be on Leirn to handle some business here, despite the growing divide that our peoples have been experiencing lately, I asked if he would like to stay at my place for the next few weeks, and Stephen said yes. I picked him up from the star port and started telling him about this blog of mine. Turns out he found it a while ago, as it was being considered for some service, how did he describe it, “Academy award but for blogs” or something like that. He was oddly willing to share a bed with me so I could have an entry for humans. I usually don't have a subject that I'm willing to write about. Heck, I've been fighting off at least seven cease-and-desist letters and 15 removal requests. So onto the review

**Sleeping: 5 out of 5, hairless ape for the win!!!!**

Sleeping with someone taller than me didn't make me feel small, lying next to them. Although the man told me he's pretty small for his species, “5’3’ or something like that. Sleeping under the blankets on windy nights, I can feel the human, despite him still wearing his special sleepwear, which I think he called pajamas. He would keep me close because he was still cold. I forgot to tell them I didn't own many blankets, and the bed was more suited for a Yotul couple than most multi-species ones. I had to get rid of most of them when I was in a lesbian relationship with a Lesbee who didn't do well without an aquatic bed. For readers wondering about that, check out post 43, where yes, I followed her back to her home colony to set her hover car on fire, and no, I’m not paying unless the Darshan shield and SC finally realize that extradition treaties are not. No one takes a knife to my late arxur boyfrind’s paintings and then flees the planet to avoid a lawsuit.



**The morning after: 5 out of 5, man knows his way around a kitchen**


Stephen didn't spend that long in the shower compared to other species, similar to arxur due to the lack of hair on most of its body aside from the hair, chest, and groin. What really caught my attention was the breakfast he managed to make. Humans, being omnivores who eat both meat and vegetables, are obviously skilled at cooking non-meat meals, unlike my arxur boyfriends (read 36 if it hasn't been taken down again). They could taste it as they wanted instead of guessing. Plus, he brought some items from the import market—called vegan bacon, ham, cheese, and eggs—so I could have a facsimile of what a predator like my exchange partner would typically have. It was remarkable not having to deal with thick fur clogging the drain, slime marks on the walls, or finding loose feathers around the house. I could get used to this.



 **Everyday interactions: 5 out of 5; humanity is one of the most Interesting and if affectionate people I have ever met**


Stephen always went out of his way to make me feel welcome in my own home; he calls it being a guest, but I didn't feel like a host based on how he treated me or the apartment.

I took him around the square, figured out how to get around with the new high-speed trains, and even took him to some of the new museums to see pre-contact days. Another thing I found bewitching about Stephen was his interest in just about everything, as he wanted to see everything.

We visited places at the old historical playhouse, spent hours together looking at old books and digitized artifacts at the restored libraries, now that the Federation wasn't actively censoring them. Heck, when he saw the beaches where people were sailing and participating in Terran watersports despite the active belittling from so-called patriots of the technocracy, I rented a boat—the same kind my mother, my real mother, took me on when I was a kid.

The kind I would have likely called my profession if the feds hadn't come all those years ago. He complimented me on my sailing skills and asked where I learned them. I broke down crying, remembering the good times. It was like before my foster parents gave me the pills for my Predator disease all those years ago.


I don't think I ever felt like this since the twins; in fact, I don't think I've even had an argument that went too far or a time I needed to step up for a possible fight. Humans seem to be able to diffuse most conflicts with their words, which possibly says more about my own general temperament than anything else.


By the end of my exchange partner's trip, he asked if I would be interested in moving back to his hometown of San Francisco. He told me his division is looking for more IT people and is even willing to pay for relocation if they accept me. I didn't know what to say besides yes.


**Overview 5 out of 5; just the person I think I needed in my life.**



I don't know when or if I will start writing this blog again, but thank you for reading it. It's been a journey.

**Wow, Nap’s number 1 fan:** if this ends up being your last blog, then I'm happy it ended on humans. I don't think I ever met one who wasn't the kindest person in the room. Good luck with moving to Earth, you won't regret it.

**Spirit of Leirn (suspended and blocked):** God, you're one of those human lovers too—way to show your approval of the new Feds' uplifting first contact policies. Can't wait for the Techno Union Council to finally shut down the human embassy. At least this stupid blog is probably ending.

1o2f5rv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1o2f5rv/empathy_in_a_world_that_numbs_us/,Empathy in a World that Numbs Us,"I’m tired.

Not the tired you can fix with sleep or coffee. The tired that sits in your bones, in your hands, in your teeth when you grit them so hard you forget it hurts. It creeps into your shoulders, makes your jaw ache, and leaves your hands trembling.

You say you’re sad. Someone looks past you.
You say you’re exhausted. Someone shrugs, distracted by their own world.
You say you need a moment. Your chest tightens, your breath catches, and still the world moves like it hasn’t noticed.

Empathy is rationed. We measure who “deserves” attention, who “uses too much,” who gets interrupted before they finish speaking. Studies call it compassion fatigue. I call it living in a world that forgets how to stay present, how to witness without judgment.

We weren’t meant to see everything we see. Doom scrolling, live videos of violence, entire countries burning across our screens... It isn’t normal. Our brains weren’t built to hold all this suffering at once. It numbs us. Our hearts race and then flatten. Our stomachs twist. Our eyes glaze. Conversations stutter because the weight of everything we’ve witnessed leaves our mouths empty. Our emotions evolve into something flattened and unrecognizable, a quiet drift toward nothingness.

Please don’t confuse this with me saying awareness isn’t needed. Awareness matters, and it matters deeply. But there has to be a better way than numbing ourselves with it, scrolling past, or letting it hollow us out. We can witness without being consumed, feel without being flattened, hold space without losing ourselves.

This is why it matters to pause and understand the difference. There are two types of witnessing:
Type one is endless, passive, uncontrolled exposure, and it overwhelms us. It floods our nervous system and numbs our capacity to feel. This is the doom of scrolling, the endless stream of trauma on screens. The second type of witnessing is intentional, human-scale presence. Sitting with someone, noticing them, feeling alongside them without needing to fix it. That’s sustainable empathy. It doesn’t demand absorbing the world’s trauma like type number one does; it asks only that you choose to witness the things in front of you.

Understanding that difference is the bridge. It allows us to refuse to look away, to honor suffering without being crushed by it, to let empathy flow instead of freeze.

We’ve made attention transactional. A nod. A platitude. A checklist. A like on a post. We forget that real care is sitting in the dark with someone else’s pain and letting it exist. That is the muscle we’re meant to stretch.

And still, there are moments that break through. A hand being held. A look that says, ""I see you."" A quiet presence that costs nothing but gives everything. That’s empathy flowing. That’s hope.

Because sometimes the most powerful thing you can do isn’t to fix the brokenness, it’s to refuse to look away from it.

Refuse to look away from the people who have been left behind by systems that don’t care. Refuse to look away from the suffering that society calls “small” or “normal.” Refuse to look away from your own exhaustion, your own pain, your own fractures. Let your chest tighten. Let your hands shake. Let your eyes sting. Witness it. Sit with it. Let it land.

Empathy is not limited. It doesn’t run out. It doesn’t demand repayment. It belongs to everyone who is brave enough to hold it open.

Not too long ago, cravings came back as well as hunger. 

So I upped my dose. Cravings are still barely manageable, and hunger is still a thing (I miss having no hunger whatsoever lol).

Before I started Monjuaro, I was easily able to IF from dinner to lunch the next day (other than a coffee for ""breakfast""). When I try that now, after hunger/cravings have come back, it's really hard. Like I'm extremely hungry. Which makes sense because I know I'm actually hungry, but why isn't it really manageable like before I started Monjuaro?

I take it in the morning.  All of a sudden at about midday I start having strange mouth issues that I think may be bruxism? 

My jaw is just moving all the time, hard to explain but I think clenching.  I keep swallowing, licking the back of my teeth.  Mouth feels odd and dry and tongue keeps constantly moving and I feel I need to open my mouth wide every few seconds.  My tongue has scalloped edges and ulcers from this.  I’m not sure why this would happen all of a sudden.  

I mentioned it to the dentist today and he said he could see that I was doing something with my mouth while I was talking to him. I’m going to see him for a checkup next week but he was talking about a night time mouthguard that would cost me £300! 

Has this happened to anyone else? I’m not sure what I should do. Should I contact ADHD 360? I am now under shared care with my GP.

This happens daily now even if I have forgotten to take my tablet.  I do have coffee so will try to cut down as that’s probably not helping.

1o2f3p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1o2f3p6/my_gerd_story/,My GERD Story,"Thought I would document my GERD story here, in case it helps anyone else.

TLDR: 51 year old, GERD all my life, on PPIs 20 years, reflux got worse recently, Pepcid and diet change has helped tremedously, got an upper GI endo scheduled 10/17, scared of cancer, will update on findings.

51 year old male, 175 pounds. I've had GERD since I was a child. I remember doing a barium test to check for ulcers because I had stomach cramps alot. I was probably around 10. No ulcers found and of course no treatment was prescirbed. This would have been the 1980s and Rolaids was the only ""treatment"". Boy do I remember my mom and grandma popping those things all the time. They no doubt had GERD as well.

Things settled down through my teens and 20s. Didn't really have any complaints. Early 30s was when I really started experiencing more classic GERD symtoms. I think it was the chest pains that finally made me talk to my doctor about it. Started taking Zantac most days and then my GP put me on PPIs, with a GERD diagnosis based on symptoms, with a possible hiatal hernia as the cause. I have been on one PPI per day every since, so for 20 years now.

GERD were largely controlled at this point. I would have the occasional problem when I ate bad.  But largely, I ate a normal unhealthy diet like most of us do. Then a few months ago it was as if I wasn't even taking a PPI any longer (even though I still take Prevacid daily). Most GERD symptoms were there now all the time after every meal. Plus some new symptoms like esophogeal pain, esophogeal gurgling when swallowing after a meal was eaten, and burping in the mornings after waking up.

I talked to my GP about it and he told me to take a Pepcid AC before bed and referred me to a Gastrointestinal doctor. Saw the gastro doc and she said it sounds like the PPI is no longer working. They need to do an upper GI endoscopy to check things out, since I may have had uncontrolled GERD for a while now. That is scheduled for next Friday, 10/17. She also put me on a second Pepcid AC in the morning. Things improved a bit with adding the two Pepcid ACs every day.

So, while I am waiting this 5 weeks for my endo, I decided to try something I have never done before: I changed my diet. I quit coffee, chocolate, caffieine, high fat or acidic foods, which I have ingested most days. I eat lots of fiber, vegetables, fruits, chicken, and fish. I also stopped eating anything 2-3 hours before bedtime.

Reflux and regrugitation have almost completely gone since the diet change. Coffee, chocolate, and acidic foods seemed to be a big culprit of things. I am losing some weight too from eating healthier. Down to 172 right now. I still have some burping in the mornings, but elevating my head more when I sleep seems to lessen that. The esophogeal gurgling isn't happening as often either.

I am still going through with my endoscopy. I want to know if there is any permanent damage in the esophagus (like Barrett's), if there is a hiatal hernia, if there are any signs of stomach cancer, etc, etc. All the usualy stuff to check for.

The cancer thing concerns me of course. At my age I am seeing too many getting cancer in my friend and famiy circle. I don't have any classic stomach cancer symptoms (unwanted weight loss, bloody stool or vomit, nauseau, vomiting, abdominal pain), my symptoms improve with medicine and diet chnages which should not be the case if I had stomach cancer, plus GERD itself doesn't cause stomach cancer. My gastro doc said she would expect to see those other symptoms as well if I had cancer, and has no expectation of cancer being found. But good ole' Google tells me GERD symtoms can be stomach cancer symptoms as well. I also understand Barrett's esophagus has a small percentage chance to turn to cancer. I'm just ready for the endoscopy so I can rule out the cancer scare that Google keeps telling me...lol.

Been with my partner for 10months. When I met him he had been seeing someone casually for a few weeks as a fwb situation. He decided he wanted something stronger with me and we got into a relationship. He wanted exclusivity etc. I opposed the idea of maintaining a friendship as first they hadn't known each other long only met a fee times and had sex, second you could not say they had an established friendship before. We met on OLD. Apparently, Months later he tells me met with her over coffee and gave her a gift. I queried why he had kept this from me when he had informed me he wouldn't do so and why could he not have sent the gift to her by post. Apparently it was achristmas gift bought before I met him but it was sooooo important to give her in person. Then not tell me about it until Months later. 
I had my suspicion about advise he was purporting to get and somehow there always seemed to be weird activity. I now believe that they never stopped talking. Lastnight for the second time he piped up that he would want to meet up with her and be friends. I informed him my boundaries and reminded him of the time when he met with her and failed to disclose this. I'm not a woman who doesn't compromise, I have met most of his female friends and only to find out one other friend was someone he was also intimate with. I do not maintain friendships with exes or previous intimate partners out of respect for their relationships and also what I prospective would be in. Also I feel that if a friendship did not naturally evolve until he met me, why maintain wanting to be friends now. I have asked him what it is he sorely misses about this person, told me they're a nice person who is intelligent and would like friendship. I respect boundaries, but this one of those i do not feel is appropriate. There has also been a situation with another female friend earlier this earlier which caused us to temporarily breakup.
AITA here? Help me out. I try to be amicable but the push to want to have this woman as a friend bewilders me. I have told him I am not comfortable with it, its less than a year they were being intimate with each other and maybe even days. ",0,1760037120.0,datingoverforty,20,0.29,False

The kind of conversation where both people can just exhale and be themselves. If that’s something you’ve been missing too, I’d really like to hear from you.

I’m 27, living in England, and I run my own business which keeps me creative and lets me set my own pace. Outside of work, I’m usually cooking something from scratch, baking when the mood strikes, or out getting some fresh air on a run or hike. I travel whenever I can, even if it’s just to a new coffee spot in a town I haven’t wandered through yet. I find a lot of peace in the small, quiet things.

I care a lot about emotional maturity. Not in a heavy way, but in the sense that I want to connect with people who aren’t afraid of depth, and who can hold space for the lightness too. I tend to connect most with people who are self-aware, thoughtful, kind without needing a reason, and naturally curious about the world and other people. I like when people are open about who they are, even if they’re still figuring some of it out. If you’re someone who wants to be truly seen and is open to doing the same in return, we’ll probably understand each other.

I’m not in a rush and I’m not here for attention. Just a simple, steady kind of presence with someone who values the same. The kind of connection that grows naturally, without needing to chase it.

If any of this feels familiar, or like something you’ve quietly been hoping to find, drop me a line. Tell me a little about yourself. Let’s see where it goes.",1,1760037069.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

Hi hello. I'm trying to distract myself from The Void™ so I thought it might be fun to see what scents you guys think match the vibe of some of my favorite DnD/Pathfinder characters I've played! Post yours and I'll return the favor! ♡♡ 

- **Heckler:** [Male, TN Gnoll/Changeling (Ghost) Witch]

Heck comes from the equivalent of Africa in the Pathfinder world. He's a witch with the Depths patron, and his mom was a Sea Hag. They're not close. He otherwise looks like a white gnoll, even whiter now because he failed a Will save and jumped into a necromancy machine that straight up killed him. But it's a horror-ish campaign so he's still kicking, just...as a ghost now. He's an entrepreneur who was trying to become a successful business owner but now he's trying to figure out why he's come back as a spooky boi. He's very dapper, he and his mouse familiar Jinx wear matching waistcoats, because even spirits need drip. He's mostly just along for the ride while the rest of the party is looking for fame/fortune and also their dad, Dracula. ^(Our table is all idiots.)

- **Carot:** [Male, CG Centaur Bard]

Carot is a centaur a la the cute lady centaurs from Fantasia. He worked as a performer in a traveling circus until he died and his body was taken over by Chad, an isekai'd nerd from our world. Chad is my real character and he's doing his best to be the isekai anime hero he truly believes he will become, but mostly he just has no idea what's happening or what anything is. Carot plays the trumpet because it's super funny to me, and he's dressed like a performer from Carnival. He's friendly and awkward and rolled so great on Charisma that a goddess granted him a permanent boon, the effects of which I still have not figured out. 

- **Joyous Rainbow:** [Female, NG Half Orc/Kobold/Half Erc, Monk]

Joyous Rainbow is the longest running character I've ever played. Like 5 years IRL. She started and ended a campaign, taking a break in the middle because I had to rework her a bit after she died the first time. She was a half-orc orphan raised by monks and at 18, got a spot on an exploration team as manual labor. She set off with what she thought was a puppy she found, but ended up being a gnoll baby who she raised as her son. She ended opening a successful coffee chain, getting reincarnated 3 times (first as a kobold, then as a half elf and finally back to half orc), dating a hot octopus lady, and killing a literal god. She also punched her way into the Astral plane on accident, where she found enlightenment. Her gnoll son is Heckler's dad.  

And lastly, the table favorite: 

- **Upfish:** [Male, Grippli (treefrog people), NG Hunter] 

Upfish is... objectively the worst character I've ever made, stats wise. Hunter kind of sucks out loud in PF1 and we found this out the hard way. Upfish was incredibly trash but also my group loved him with a burning passion because he was so trash. Upfish is a 1ft tall white frog with red spots and black eyes (based on a morph of the incredibly cool harlequin dart frog). He is somewhat creepy, quiet and just sort of exists. He rides a ankylosaurus that is his best friend. He's also an incredibly successful business man, who founded a family business to ensure his many siblings will be cared for and also founded a massive orphanage that employs older kids in many trades and functions as a way for us to sell our loot at full price. He is absolutely abysmal at combat, and is usually covered in glitter courtesy of our Paladin who finds him hard to look at, but also runs the orphanage with him. Everyone assumes they're married, including Upfish because she is weirdly attached to him. His main weapon is a bow and he once famously lost an archery competition to a teammate who had never held a bow before. He and his wife(?) retired from the team to run their orphanage. I love him. 


Yes all my characters are dumb and for some reason mostly business owners. I work with what I know lol. I can't be mean in games because I feel bad so they're all generally nice because idk why not. ♡

1o2etoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o2etoo/theres_something_under_the_boardwalk/,There’s Something Under The Boardwalk.,"
If you’re reading this, it’s because I have no other choice. Nobody will listen to me, not even the police. It’s only a matter of time before they come for me, and when they do, this is the only evidence of the truth. There is something under the boardwalk in Paradise Point, and it’s hungry.

October is always a terribly slow month. We’re barely open, but the owners want to squeeze every penny they can before this town is completely empty. Even on a Friday night, it’s already a ghost town. That’s where this all began — a cold, deafeningly quiet night at the record shop I spend my days working in.

“Spectre’s: Records & Rarities”; a store that really was dead in the water until vinyl made a huge comeback. We also sold shirts that you might find a middle schooler wearing, even though they wouldn’t be able to name a single song off the album they’re donning. It really was a place frozen in time — the smell of dust and the decay of better days always filled the room.

The best way to pass the time on a night like this would be to find a forgotten record to play. That was my favorite game — finding an album I’d never heard of and giving it a chance to win me over. After all, if I’m not going to play them, who will?

Tonight’s choice: “Secret Treaties” by Blue Öyster Cult. Of course, I knew “Don’t Fear the Reaper” — who doesn’t? I never sat down and listened to their albums, even though their logo and album artwork always intrigued me. Seeing the album made me think of my dad. I remember him telling me about seeing them live with Uriah Heep at the old Spectrum in the 70’s. I bet he still had the ticket stub, too. God, he loved that place. I even remember seeing him shed a tear the day they tore it down.

The opening chords of “Career of Evil” blared out of my store speakers as I dropped the needle. Had my mind not been elsewhere, I wouldn’t have startled myself into spilling my coffee. The previously white album cover and sleeve were now browned and tainted. Who would want it now? Looks like it was coming home with me. After all, a song titled “Harvester of Eyes” certainly had a place in my collection. The owner wouldn’t care anyway — he had jokingly threatened to set the store ablaze for insurance money. Had this shop not been attached to others on this boardwalk, I wouldn’t have put it past him.

The opening track sold me, and given the state of business, I decided it was time to close up shop. The only thing louder than BÖC was the ticking clock that sat above an old “Plan 9 From Outer Space” poster. Just as the second track reached its finale, I lifted the needle. I retrieved one of our spare plastic sleeves to prevent any more damage and stowed it away in my backpack.

I took a walk outside to see if there were any stragglers roaming the boards. All I could see was a long and winding road of half-closed shops and stiffened carnival rides lit only by the amber sky of an autumn evening. Soon it would be dark, and the boardwalk would belong to the night and all that inhabited it.

The garage doors of the shop slammed shut with a finality that reminded me of the months to come. The sound echoed around me, only to be consumed by the wind. It wasn’t nearly as brutal as the gusty winter months, but it swirled with the open spaces as if it were dancing with the night. The padlock clicked as I scrambled the combination, and I turned to greet the darkness that painted over the beach. Summer was truly over now.

The soundtrack of carnival rides, laughter, and stampeding feet was replaced with the moans of hardwood under my feet. Each step felt like I was disturbing somebody’s grave. That was the reality of this place — four months out of the year, it’s so full of life that it’s overwhelming. The rest of its time is spent as a graveyard that is hardly visited. Maybe that’s why I never left. If I don’t visit, who will?

Speaking of visiting — this was the point of my trek home that I saw Bane. They called him that because he was a rather large man, built like a hulking supervillain. In reality, he was as soft as a teddy bear but, unfortunately, homeless. Even from the distance I saw him — which was two blocks away — there was no mistaking him. I only ever saw him sparingly; he never stayed in the same place for long and often slept under the boardwalk. I often thought he was self-conscious of his stature and didn’t want to scare people.

I could see that he must have been taking in the same swirling twilight sky I had seen earlier. Now, he was merely entertaining the stars. Looking to my left, I saw that Vincent’s Pizzeria was closing up shop. They must have had a better run of business than I did.

I slinked over to the counter to see a solitary slice looking for a home in the display case. The girl working the counter had her back to me, and as I began to make an attempt for her attention, she screamed.

“Oh my god! You scared me!” she gasped.

Chuckling nervously, I apologized. “I’m sorry, I just wanted to grab that slice before you closed up.”

I made an honest try at a friendly smile, and she laughed.

“Sure, sure. Three bucks.”

As she threw the slice in the oven to warm it up, she turned her attention back to me. “So, any plans tonight?”

I thought about it, and I really didn’t have any. I knew my ritual at this point — work and then visit Mick’s for a drink or two until I’ve had enough to put me to sleep.

“I was going to head over to Mick’s, maybe catch the game for a bit.”

She grinned. “I know Mick’s — right around the corner, yeah? Maybe I’ll stop by. There isn’t much else to do on a night like tonight.”

I handed her a five and signaled to her to keep the change.

“Maybe I’ll see you there,” I said half-heartedly, giving one last smile as I departed.

She waved, and I focused my attention on the walk ahead. She seemed plenty nice — might be nice to interact with someone. First, I had something I wanted to do.

Bane was right where I last saw him, except now he was gathering his things. I approached him with some haste.

“Hey bud, I haven’t seen you in a while.”

When he turned to see it was me, a smile grew across his face. “Hey Mac, long time.”

In my patented awkward fashion, I continued. “It’s been dead out here, huh?”

Without looking up, he lamented, “Sure has. It’s that time of year. Certainly not going to miss it.”

Puzzled, I pressed him. “What do you mean?”

Once he finished packing his bag, he sighed and his baritone voice continued. “I need to get some help. I’m going to go to that place in Somerdale and finally get myself clean.”

He sounded so absolute in what he was saying. I couldn’t have been happier.

“That’s great, man! I’d give you a ride myself if I had a car.”

I chuckled — that really did make my night.

He took another deep breath. “I just need to see her again.”

He revealed a small photo in his pocket, presenting it in his large hands. The picture showed a newborn baby girl in the hands of the man in front of me.

“I haven’t really seen her since she was born. Once I lost my job and… everything just started falling apart…” he trailed off.

He shook it off to say, “I’m just ready. Tonight’s my last night — I have my bus ticket ready to go, first thing in the morning. I just thought I would take in one last sunset and say goodbye to the others. I saved enough money to get me one night at The Eagle Nest.”

I was hard-pressed to find words. I didn’t know he had a daughter. It was a lot to take in, but above all, I was so thrilled to hear what he was setting off to do.

Remembering what I had in my hands, I spoke up. “Vincent’s was closing up, and I thought you could use a bite. Since this is going to be the last time I’ll see you, I won’t take no for an answer.”

We both smirked. He reached up for the quickly cooling slice of pizza.

“That’s really nice of you, Mac. I appreciate it.”

Not sure what else to do, I shot my hand forward to him for a shake. “I really think what you’re doing is great. It’s been nice knowing you.”

He reached his enormous paw to mine and shook it. “You too. I’d say I’ll see you again, but I really hope it’s not here.”

He chuckled as he swung his bag onto his back. I smiled back and waved goodbye. As we made our separate ways, a question occurred to me.

“Hey, what’s your real name, by the way? Maybe I’ll look you up someday to see how you’re doing.”

Without turning fully around, he said, “It doesn’t really matter.”

With that, he retreated into the night and left me to wonder what he meant by that.

I was soon reaching the block where Mick’s resides. The pub was right off the boardwalk — the neon lights that illuminated nearby were shining across the face of The Mighty King Kong ride. Thankfully, my work and home were all within a short walk of one another. Mick’s served as the ever-so-convenient median between the two. Mick’s was also where I picked up shifts in the offseason. They must have noticed the frequency with which I visited and decided to offer me a job. It was a solid gig — Mick’s was one of the few year-round places on the island. Locals gravitated toward it once the summer crowds dissipated. If I was going to spend my time there, I figured I might as well get paid.

Just as I was rounding the corner to the off-ramp, something happened. A loose board that hugged the wall greeted my sneaker and sent me tumbling down. All this tourism revenue, and this damn boardwalk is still old enough for Medicare.

I turned over onto my side to see where my backpack had landed. It was adjacent to the culprit. I groaned as I reached over to grab it — when something caught my eye.

Along the wall, hiding just below the wood, I saw what looked like a wasp’s nest. It was peeking out from the dark at me, almost as if it was watching me. I peered at it with the light of the pub guiding me.

This wasn’t a wasp’s nest.

It was a sickly pale yellow. Its texture looked wet, almost as if it was hot candle wax burning from a flame. Maybe the fall had disoriented me, but I could swear I saw it moving — rising and falling ever so subtly. Like it was… breathing?

I adjusted my eyes as I leaned in. It wasn’t very big — maybe the size of a tennis ball. It was riddled with holes, craters that left very little room for much else. I couldn’t help but glare at them.

Then it happened.

1o2etm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1o2etm0/aitah_for_not_going_out_with_a_guy_after_texting/,AITAH for not going out with a guy after texting him for 3 months? I also unintentionally spoke to his friend.,"I’m a 22F. 

Dates back to Jan 2023, we were in the same college and this guy (let’s call him Isaac) hit me up on insta with a “hi do you go to this college too?” We had a lot of mutual followers so we started texting each other, realized we had a lot of similar interests so the conversations just went on and on. He said that he finds me really cute and is interested in knowing me more. I was his bestfriend’s roomie’s friend so he knew I existed. 

After a few weeks he was like “can I take you out for dinner?” and I said “yes but later.” We spoke to each other for close to 3 months out of which he prolly asked me out 6-7 times from breakfast to dinners to drives and I kept on postponing all of them (I had severe social anxiety back then which I communicated to him) 

He confessed his feelings that he really likes me, wants to be w me, cannot go a day without speaking to me, he wants to make me his. I told him I like him too. He even showed upto my dorm building late at night and go like “I’m here”  and I’d not go meet him lol and there was a point where he was like “just be upfront that you don’t wanna be w me, don’t play all these games” I was like bro I fr wanna meet you but I’ve anxiety, just give it some more time. It was spring break, we traveled, my friends forced me to talk to a guy there and after Isaac found about it, he sent me a video of him making out with a girl lol by saying “I want you to know everything about me, pls forgive me. I’m sorry, don’t leave me pls” I was like you don’t owe me anything, live your life. He was very experienced and he himself told me that he had multiple hook ups and dated around in the past. 

Anyway, I think he started to get tired because he’d constantly nudge me about if we’d ever see each other and the nail on the coffin was when I heard from a close friend that he was “investigating” about me by essentially asking this girl to find info about me cos he thought I was ‘sus’ and wouldn’t meet him for months so he’s worried I’m hiding something like a secret bf and I’m v antisocial so he doesn’t know much about me. I confronted him about it and the he straight up denied but he was caught red handed w evidence and he said if it’s an issue for me, he can leave as he’s tired of it going nowhere for months and he’s not interested in dating anymore. I said ok cool. Suddenly he lost his cool and he started abusing me. He was like he forced himself to like me, he was convincing himself that I’m the one for him but I’m nowhere close to what he wanted, I’m a loser, I live under a shell, people who think they know me don’t acc know me because I don’t know who I am or what I want blah blah it went on and on. He blocked me everywhere from insta to Spotify - this was March 2023. Removed all my friends months later. Would block and unblock me. Watched my stories from his spam account. It was a very emotional time for me, I didn’t realize how much I liked him until he was gone, I spent months crying over him and how we ended. 

Months later (December 2023) I reached out to him by saying hey we’re both international students and college is ending in a few months and we’d never get to see each other again. Do you wanna meet and talk and sort the fight out because we ended on really bad terms? I’m chill if you’re not up for it too, no pressure. Good luck. 

He surprisingly replied very earnestly, spoke to me like there was no drama at all, like we were old friends and was like ya let’s grab coffee blah blah. He dragged it for a month, he’d say yes and disappear, and I was like bro I don’t think this is happening so I’ll just tell you what I’d have otherwise preferred to tell you in person and I gave him an apology, explained my pov, my issues, called him out for his antics, and finally said a goodbye. He was like he wasn’t able to meet me cos he’s got a gf, they’ve been together for a month or so (idk why he even agreed to coffee or even responded in the first place to begin with in that case) and it’s inappropriate to talk to me, said sorry and was like I think you’re a good person blah blah. I left it on read and that was the last time I ever spoke to him. A month later I unsent all my messages to him and closed the chapter. This was January 2024 and marks the last time I ever spoke to him. 

I also cut off my best friend during that time because she was genuinely very toxic towards me and treated me in a horrible way and she immediately went and befriended him after lol. She was very public about it and she wanted to rub it on my face that she’s a part of his circle now. 

Anyway, Isaac saw me on campus and would keep staring at me but we never acknowledged each other. We both graduated in May 2024 and I thought that was that. Months after graduation he liked an old message of mine and turns out it was accidental as he was lurking through old chats (why would a guy w a gf even open an old chat? Idk) He’d view my stories despite him not following me so I made my account private. 

In October 2024, my ex bestfriend (the one I cut off) sent me an email, messaged me on WhatsApp using a new number, and messaged me on insta using a new account only to ask me to meet her because she really wants to talk to me. I wanted to respect what we had in the past so I met her and during the 2 hour conversation, she brought Isaac’s name up 3 times despite me telling her that I don’t want to talk about him. Towards the end of the conversation, she said “I know you don’t want to talk about Isaac but I just wanted to let you know we’ll be getting engaged in the future. He’s been flirting with me a lot, his family sent my family a proposal for marriage, they’ve been so persistent, Isaac is smitten by me and won’t leave me alone…” I was genuinely shook like what even? But I knew she wanted a reaction out of me so I kept a straight face and said “congrats!” I left sometime later and she messaged me multiple times asking to hang out  but I politely declined. 


Anyway, I left all that behind. It’s been almost 2 years since I last spoke to him. I joined hinge recently, started chatting w this guy who went to college in Canada. I was really open with him and told him that I never dated before, I spoke to a guy online for a couple months and it went nowhere, I went on a few days with this other guy but we weren’t compatible. He was very understanding and was like he dated 3 girls. After chatting for a week, we were in the middle of planning when to meet - he seemed really into me. He wanted to show me around, was making plans of me meeting his friends, figuring out a good first date spot. 

All of a sudden, he doesn’t talk to me for a day and he comes back to say “my friend Isaac told me that he knew you and spoke to you for a while.

He was acting a little uncomfortable so I told him that Isaac was getting engaged to my own ex bestie who I was friends with for years so that shows we were never a thing. The guy was dumbfounded and said “idk where you got that from but Isaac was dating this other girl until earlier this year. Someone lied to you” 

I gave him my side and told him that I don’t mind speaking to him if it’s weird for him.  He was like I’m sorry but it’ll just get too complicated. I bid him goodbye and removed him.

Wednesday, the pain was nearly unbearable, I couldn't eat anything and felt nauseous and exhausted and miserable. I spent the day planning on cancelling my RTKR surgery 12/2 due to my pain and misery and feeling like recovery would be too difficult.

This morning, I woke up and got myself to the restroom. I walked to the kitchen with walker and made coffee. I walked around the living room and ate a piece of toast. Took a shower. Went to PT (range is 95 and my gait is good). Back in bed now with motion machine (if you have one use it and use it often. Doesn't help with recovery but really, really helps with pain!).

**Magic is real, and Reggie Hickson just got invited to be a wizard school summer camp transfer.**  
  
Reggie was a self-made businessman who'd pulled himself and his oddball dad out of poverty through sheer determination and the glory of YouTube tutorials. Pretty impressive, honestly. That was until a three-inch tall sprite emerged from his coffee mug and told him he was a wizard. Scratch that—a warlock. Apparently there's a difference, and that difference involves stuff we probably shouldn't go into in this good Christian blurb.  
  
Now he's at Thistlewick School of Wizardcraft and Witchery, which happens to be in a magical land called Everafter. Much to his dismay, Everafter has a problem; specifically, a reproduction problem. Thus, he finds himself surrounded by monster girl co-eds who happen to be conveniently inexperienced with boys. First, he meets Tizzy, an adorable lisping jackalope girl, but she's just the first of many monster cuties that he ends up entangled with. Sphinxes, valkyries, fairies, oh my! It's a good thing stamina is one of Reggie's ""warlocky"" strengths.  
  
Oh, and he has less than a week to brush up on two years of magical curriculum and pass the placement exam or he'll be held back when the semester starts while his new lady friends move on to senior year.

1o2epgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousePowered/comments/1o2epgb/delve_into_the_best_outdoor_griddle_blackstone/,Delve Into the Best Outdoor Griddle Blackstone 1962 Worth Cooking On,"Cooking outdoors has always been one of my favorite ways to gather with family and friends, and when I stumbled upon the Blackstone 1962, I knew I had to give it a shot. A combination of a griddle and an air fryer? That sounded like a game-changer for backyard BBQs and patio cooking parties. After putting it through a couple of weekends and testing its features, I can confidently say that this heavy-duty cooking station brings joy and some challenges to your outdoor cooking adventures.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the Blackstone 1962 looks solid, sleek, and ready to tackle any backyard feast. Its stainless steel frame and painted finish give it a premium vibe while ensuring longevity. The inclusion of four caster wheels makes mobility a breeze, which is great because my backyard is notoriously uneven. Measuring 25.5""D x 54.5""W x 45""H, it’s big enough to cook for a crowd but not so massive that it dominates the patio. I especially loved the two side shelves for prep and convenience—they’re sturdy enough to hold utensils, seasonings, and my coffee mug when I start grilling early morning breakfasts. The magnetic strip for tools is genius; I didn’t have to fumble around looking for a spatula in the middle of flipping burgers.

Cooking enthusiasts should definitely [Check Blackstone 1962 price on Amazon.](https://chvnx.com/p/b09199nrdk/)

**Performance and Cooking Diversity**  
Trying out the dual cooking systems was where the fun began. The griddle has 524 square inches of cooking surface, making it a powerhouse for any large gathering. It comfortably fit 18 burgers during our family cookout, and even after all those patties, I used the built-in rear grease trap, which handled the mess like a champ. The air fryer integration is what surprised me most. Designed to hold 2 quarts of food, the fryer makes guilt-free crispy fries, wings, and even veggies with an adjustable temperature range from 300°F to 475°F. During one test, I cooked burgers on the grill while making fries in the fryer—everything was ready to eat at the same time. It can bake, sauté, roast, and air fry, making it perfect for diversifying meals in one cooking session.

**Ease of Use and Setup**  
Assembly was painless. Although I was initially worried about the size, the instructions were straightforward, and I didn’t even need help from my neighbor (who typically insists on lending a hand). The electric igniter starts the burners effortlessly. With 34,000 BTUs from the griddle and an additional 13,000 BTUs for the fryer, the heat distribution was impressive, giving me consistent results no matter where on the griddle I cooked. Wiping down the cooking surface post-use is easy too, but a word of caution: the grease trap does fill up quicker than you’d expect, especially during big meals, so remember to check it periodically while cooking.

**Strengths**  
• The versatility to cook everything from breakfast pancakes to air-fried snacks  
• Excellent mobility thanks to the caster wheels  
• Side shelves and magnetic tool strip for added functionality  
• Heat distribution is even and reliable  
• Rear grease trap simplifies cleanup  

**Areas of Concern**  
• The air fryer basket capacity might feel a bit limited for larger groups  
• Some users (including me) may wish the temperature dials were marked with more precise settings  
• It’s propane-powered, which means additional costs for purchasing and refilling tanks  

**Product Alternatives**  
Among outdoor cooking stations, the Blackstone 1962 stands out for its unique air fryer addition. Compared to other outdoor griddles, like the Camp Chef Flat Top Grill, the air frying capability is a distinct edge, offering a healthier cooking style and creating variety. However, the Camp Chef does have a slightly higher cooking surface, which might appeal to those feeding extra-large crowds. On the other hand, if air frying isn’t important to you, the Weber Spirit II E-310 BBQ grill offers a traditional grilling experience with a more compact footprint, but it lacks the multifunctionality of the Blackstone. Ultimately, this cooking station is best for those who want a balance of grilling and healthier cooking options without sacrificing efficiency.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Considering the features packed into this unit, I genuinely feel the Blackstone 1962 delivers excellent bang for the buck. The ability to griddle and air fry in one compact station is a standout, particularly at its price point. I’ve looked at similar griddles, and while they may cost less, they lack the premium materials and multi-functionality that this station offers. It’s an investment for sure, but one that pays off with versatility for years of outdoor meals to come. If you’re serious about grilling and want a reliable machine with a bit of flair, this is worth every penny.

1o2enrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1o2enrt/aita_for_demanding_half_of_everything_in_my/,"""AITA for demanding half of everything in my divorce after my husband emotionally neglected me for years, even though I had an affair?","I told my husband I was leaving him for my ex after 23 years of marriage and now his entire family has disowned me after finding out I was sleeping with my ex for the last two years.

So here's what happened. I've been married for 23 years. Two kids. Nice house. The whole package on paper. But I've been miserable for the last decade. My husband works all the time. He's a good provider but emotionally he's just not there. We stopped having sex three years ago. We barely talk. I felt like a roommate in my own marriage.

Then I reconnected with my ex from college on social media about two years ago. We started talking. Just friendly at first. But then we met up for coffee. And I remembered what it felt like to be seen. To be wanted. To feel alive.

We started an affair. I'm not proud of it but I'm also not going to pretend I regret it. Those were the happiest months I'd had in years. My ex made me laugh. He listened to me. He made me feel like I mattered.

Six months ago my ex told me he wanted me to leave my husband. That he wanted us to be together for real. And I realized I wanted that too. I deserved to be happy. Life is too short to spend it in a dead marriage.

So last month I sat my husband down and told him. I said, ""I'm leaving you. I'm in love with someone else and I want a divorce.""

He just stared at me. Then he said, ""Who is it?""

I told him it was my ex. That we'd been seeing each other. That I was moving in with him.

My husband's face went white. He said, ""How long?""

""Two years,"" I said.

He stood up and walked out of the room. Didn't yell. Didn't cry. Just left. That was somehow worse.

The next day I told him I wanted half of everything. The house. His retirement accounts. Half his income for alimony. I'd been a stay at home mom for fifteen years. I gave up my career for our family. I deserved my share.

He said no.

Just flat out refused. He said, ""You cheated on me for two years and you think you deserve anything? Get a lawyer.""

I got a lawyer. A good one. She said I had a strong case for alimony and asset division regardless of the affair. But my husband hired an even better lawyer. And his family started paying for it.

That's when I made my mistake.

I went to his parents. I thought if I explained things to them they'd understand. That they'd see their son had neglected me. That they'd help me get what I was owed.

I showed up at their house and his mother answered. I said, ""I need to talk to you about your son.""

She let me in. I sat down and explained everything. How lonely I'd been. How their son had ignored me. How I'd fallen in love with someone who actually cared about me. How I just wanted a fair divorce settlement.

His mother listened. Then she said, ""You've been cheating on my son for two years and you have the nerve to come here asking for our help?""

I said, ""This isn't about the affair. This is about me getting what I'm legally entitled to.""

His father came into the room. He said, ""Get out of our house.""

I said, ""You don't understand. Your son pushed me away. I had no choice.""

His mother stood up. She said, ""You had a choice every single time you got into bed with another man. Now get out before I call the police.""

I left. But I didn't stop there.

I called his sister. I called his brother. I sent emails to his whole family explaining my side. How I'd suffered. How I'd been emotionally abandoned. How I was just trying to build a new life.

They all sided with him.

Then it got worse. His brother posted everything on social media. Screenshots of my emails. The whole story. Tagged me in it. Within 24 hours everyone knew. My friends. My kids' friends' parents. People from my old job.

My own mother called me and said, ""What were you thinking?""

I said, ""I was thinking I deserved happiness.""

She said, ""You destroyed your family. For what? Some fantasy with an old boyfriend?""

But here's the thing. It wasn't a fantasy. My ex and I were real. We had plans.

Except three weeks ago my ex told me he needed space. That things were moving too fast. That maybe we should take a break while I sorted out my divorce.

I said, ""You told me to leave my husband. This was your idea.""

He said, ""I know. But I didn't think it would be this messy. Your husband's family is threatening to sue me for alienation of affection. My work found out. It's affecting my reputation.""

I said, ""So you're abandoning me?""

He said, ""I just need some time to think.""

That was three weeks ago. He won't return my calls now.

My lawyer says my case is falling apart. Turns out the affair does matter in our state. I might not get alimony. I'll be lucky to get a 40-60 split instead of 50-50. And my husband is pushing for full custody because I ""abandoned the family home.""

My kids won't talk to me. They're 17 and 19. They found out about the affair from their cousins. My daughter sent me a text that said, ""You're not my mother anymore.""

My son blocked my number.

I'm staying with a friend now. She's the only one who hasn't cut me off. But even she says I should have handled this differently. That I should have gotten divorced first before starting something new.

But I loved him. I still love him. And I thought I deserved to be happy after 23 years of giving everything to a man who didn't appreciate me.

Now I have nothing. No husband. No ex. No kids. No family support. No money for a good lawyer. My husband's family is funding his legal team and they're burying me.

My friend says I need to apologize. To my husband. To my kids. To his family. She says maybe if I show remorse they'll back off.

But I don't know if I can do that. Because apologizing means admitting I was wrong. And I don't think I was wrong for wanting to be happy.

Was I wrong for trying to get my fair share just because I had an affair?",2,1760036490.0,FoundandExpose,4,0.75,False

And when the mask fell, the world discovered the real Carly. “I'm nice on the outside, but I'm really mean and evil.” That line is her.Everything she wanted to hide deep inside came to light during the trial.

The trial revealed a cold, calculating, narcissistic, and proud girl. A girl who refused to take responsibility for what she had done, preferring to hide behind imaginary excuses. The prosecutor made it clear: Carly never thought about her dead mother. Even her friends, like Bennett, admitted that everything she said seemed false. It was all an act. 🎭 No more glitter, no more princesses, no more beautiful stories, no more rainbows. 🌈 No more beautiful appearances. Everything was revealed.

Not a girl who lies, who manipulates, and who destroys what is most precious to her. The support group tries to humanize her, to make her look like a victim, but it's way too easy. Yes, I feel for her, because it's sad, it's a waste... But it's too late. Everyone has seen her true colors, her true personality. Carly never cried for her mother. Never a sincere word for her grandparents. Nothing. Everything was pretense, everything was a facade. It's too easy not to show emotion at the trial, but it's also very revealing. She knew what she had done. And what we saw was shame, yes, the real shame of a girl who doesn't take responsibility. A girl who called herself intelligent, when in reality, she wasn't. Because true intelligence is having a heart, not calculating evil. And Carly, she chose the worst path. Even the prosecutor said it: ""What she was missing was school."" And hearing that, on the fifth day of the trial, sends shivers down your spine. Because everyone understood. Yes, it's weird, really weird about Carly. A girl so bright, so gifted, but without soul, without emotion, without light. Today, Carly lives in shame. It's a huge slap in the face for her, and for everyone who believed in her image.

Not a philosophical one, not the kind found in beautiful books, but a dark hole where I cannot tell if the fall is punishment or relief. Since December 31st, when my mother died, time has stopped having dates. I nearly died too: overdose, sirens, silence. I woke up in a hospital with iron in my mouth and a transparent desire to never return anywhere.

Today I survive on risperidone, citalopram, and clonazepam. I am held upright by black labels and reheated coffee. I never abandoned the organic tobacco; it is my only temple, my pocket-sized false Buddha.

My life became a hallway of unanswered résumés. I have no diploma, no official title, but I worked in what people now call artificial intelligence: creating prompts, writing, translating, transcribing, trying to build money from words and machines. None of it saved me, but I learned how to work in silence. Recording darkness became the last task I knew how to do.

I have a grave lack of vitamin D and an excess of memories that medication refuses to let me feel. The potholes on the streets resemble the holes inside my head. I don’t know how many cigarettes I have smoked while writing this, maybe enough to pave my resignation. My mother was consumed by cancer, and I was consumed with her. Faith died alongside her: the law of attraction, chakras, sacred geometry, all of it became dead ink on my skin. Metatron’s Cube never paid my bills.

My last love was with a woman who carried demons tattooed on her body. It ended with police, station cells, and a psychiatric ward. After that, I tried to die. I failed. I came back. I returned without knowing why. I carry minimal illness and maximal fear. Two years without a body touching mine, only me and this machine people call a mind.

Now I live with my 71-year-old father, a 1990 Parati GLS parked in memory, and a future that will not call me back. I fear on-site jobs because I cannot leave him alone. I fear remote jobs because I no longer trust myself. I am a 30-year-old man with the soul of a corrupted file. I do small freelance work for blogs while waiting for a practical miracle. What do I want? Merely to be functional again. To wake up one day without negotiating with death.

If I write, it is instinct.  
If I exist, it is an accident.

And yet, I confess: there is something in me that has not died. It is not hope. It is stubbornness. Perhaps that is the last god: stubbornness.

This one didn't look at me at all.

The fifth briefing in two weeks was still warm in my ear when I shouldered through blue tape and it slapped my sleeve, stuck, and came away with a sound like wet paper. Apartment 4B, northeast ward. Someone had propped the door open with a phone book that hadn't seen a hand in years. The air was cold enough to make the mirror forget itself. Shampoo and HVAC and something sweet underneath that didn't belong.

She was kneeling in the tub. Early twenties. Head tipped, all the weight gone from her neck. The hair, black, glossy, went up to the shower rail and stayed there.

At first I wrote ""tied."" Then I crossed it out.

There wasn't a knot. The hair made a loop around the rail, clean as if a carpenter had drawn it, the lay so smooth it looked intentional. Rope will do that, if you treat it right. Hair won't. Hair looks like hair. This looked like a decision.

I crouched. There was lint in it, curtain lint, not from this room. My hand wrote faster than my head: *loop held by its own lay.* I didn't like that sentence. I also didn't like that it felt correct.

""Investigator."" The sergeant was in the doorway with an earbud pinched between fingers. ""Run the brief while you work.""

I pressed it in.

*""...first victim: silk scarf on a door handle. No knot present. Loop supported weight. Clean crescent bruise below the ear.""*

*""...second: shower curtain hem braided around the throat, found on tile.""*

*""...third: shoelaces. Platform fall. Bows became square knots.""*

*""...fourth: hostel bed. Phone cable around wrist. Binding completed but never cinched.""*

""Serial?"" I asked, still watching the loop.

""Has to be,"" he said, but he didn't sound like he believed anybody could be this neat five times without tool marks, without even trying to show off.

*Nobody.* Except the pull-cord by the bathroom window had thrown itself into a lazy loop and was busy becoming less lazy. The AC kicked, and the tail twisted a quarter turn. The rail above the tub made a small tick, the sound a thing makes when it takes a little more of the load.

Nobody near either one.

  


Back at the board they'd drawn the city like a mouth and stuck five red teeth in it. Someone had circled them with a dry-erase that squealed on the plastic. Nobody said why it felt satisfying, drawing a ring.

""Midpoint's upcountry,"" a junior said, tapping a gray label none of us had noticed until he touched it. ""Old shrine site. We got material from a family clearing a house there. Ledger, some pamphlets.""

He slid a plastic sleeve across the table. The pamphlet was friendly in the way paper gets when it forgets what it's for: cartoon rope under a concrete gate, children with round open mouths. *Seal the Last Knot Under the Gate!* the caption said in wide, trusting type. *Two claps for safety.*

In the corner, the shrine name sat in clean print. Someone had X'd the first character and penciled another above it.

I leaned closer. The printed version read *Naigami* with the kanji 内—*inside*. The penciled correction used 綯—*to twine, to rope*. Same sound in the mouth. Completely different meaning in the world.

""These aren't the same god,"" I said.

The junior nodded. ""The granddaughter who brought this in? She said the tourist board changed it in the seventies. Thought 'inner god' sounded safer than 'rope god.' Easier to sell as protection instead of... whatever the other one was.""

Under the pamphlet lay a page that looked like vines. Old cursive that didn't care if modern eyes could keep up. In the margin, a younger hand had tried to walk beside it: *granary latch / two claps / warm / dawn*—and the pencil line thinned out like it had run into a word it didn't want to translate.

""Who penciled this?"" I asked.

""The granddaughter. Her grandmother was the last one who still twisted the straw for the festival. She called it 'the finishing.'"" He tapped the pamphlet. ""The priest calls it 'the sealing.' Says families like that word better.""

I held the ledger at an angle. The old hand wrote like weather: deliberate, no hurry. The penciled translation ran along the margin: *Tie rope at storehouse latch at dusk. Two claps. Warm breath. Untie at dawn. Move to gate for day.*

""Move it?"" I said. ""Back and forth?""

""Every day,"" the junior said. ""The grandmother told her it was important. Tie it at the granary when dark comes, untie it when light comes, hang it at the gate during the day. Back and forth. The priest just leaves one big rope at the gate now. Year-round. Says it's tradition.""

I looked from the cartoon children clapping under the gate to the penciled *warm* and felt the back of my neck go cold. ""He's doing it backwards.""

""Ma'am?""

""The old ritual moved the rope. Tied and untied it. Opened and closed the loop every single day."" I pointed at the pamphlet. ""This tells people to seal the last knot at the gate and leave it there. That's not the same instruction.""

The junior's face did something complicated. ""The granddaughter said her grandmother used to get angry about it. Said a knot that never gets untied starts to think it's supposed to stay closed. Starts closing everything around it.""

We pinned the pamphlet beside a tassel someone had found at the first victim's inn, straw ends frayed, paper zigzags clinging like static could remember. When the priest came down from the hills later in a jacket that didn't understand dust, he said words that fit in a microphone. Community, respect, tradition. He used the word *seal* the way some people use *amen*.

""Where do the old ropes go?"" I asked.

""Disposed,"" he said, after the kind of pause a man uses to pick a polite word. ""Annually.""

""All of them?""

""A piece was kept. For display. People like to see the history."" He looked at the tassel under glass but didn't touch it. He read it like it might read him back.

""That's the piece,"" he said quietly.

  


I made my own version of the map on a legal pad because I don't trust anything that stands up on wheels. Five dots. If you put a coffee cup on them, the cup wouldn't wobble. The hamlet sat dead center, the place where a grandmother had died, where a penciled ledger said *untie at dawn* and a glossy pamphlet said *seal*.

I told myself I was driving up there to rule out the obvious: a squatter with a taste for ritual, a group with a handbook, a bored kid who'd learned three knots and wanted the city to clap.

The pass took the car and gave it back in strips. Fog, then cedar, then fog. The hamlet was every hamlet: cedar planks silvered by weather, a granary with a low iron latch, a torii gate that made concrete look tired. Someone had strung a fat rope across the lintel, the straw a yellow that straw only is when it hasn't earned it yet. The braiding was perfect. The tassels were twins. It looked like a smile that didn't reach the eyes.

On the granary door, a length of older braid hung by one end, splayed fibers like hair after a brush. It wanted to be a loop and had never been given the command.

The air smelled like attic, and something else: the warm edge of someone's breath after they've been laughing in the cold. I don't know why I noticed that.

""Officer?""

She had the ledger hugged to her chest and city shoes that hated the slope. ""I'm Mika,"" she said. ""I brought more pages.""

We stood under the pretty rope at the gate. The valley wind came down like a hand smoothing cloth, and the tassel ends skimmed my shoulder. I had the stupid, specific urge to step forward and tuck them up where they belonged. My fingers made a shape they hadn't decided to make.

""Your grandmother moved the rope every day,"" I said. ""Granary to gate, gate to granary.""

""At dusk and dawn,"" Mika said. She opened the ledger to a line written in slow, certain ink. ""She'd tie the rope at the granary latch when it got dark. Clap twice. Breathe on it once, she said it reminded the rope it was in the world, that it had work to do but the work had limits."" She traced the penciled words without looking at them. ""Then at dawn she'd untie it and move it to the gate for the day. Just hanging there, loose. No knot. Then back to the granary at dusk to close again.""

""And the priest?""

""Puts one rope at the gate and leaves it. All year. He thinks he's sealing something in."" Her voice got quiet. ""But she always said you can't seal something that's supposed to breathe. You just teach it to hold its breath until it can't anymore. Then it might die.""

Down the slope, a tin roof clapped twice and went still.

I looked at the machine rope hanging fat and permanent under the gate, then at the fraying braid on the granary latch. The pamphlet in my pocket felt too loud. ""People are dying in a circle around this place,"" I said. ""Five of them. All within ten kilometers. All of them bound by things that shouldn't be able to bind, hair, fabric, cords that tied themselves.""

Mika's hand tightened on the ledger. ""When did it start?""

""Two weeks after your grandmother died.""

She closed her eyes. ""She was the last one doing it right. The last one moving the rope.""

I thought about the loop in the girl's hair. About door tape that wanted to stick. About a morgue zipper a tech had to open twice because it closed itself between his hands. Little acts that didn't know when to stop.

""Show me how she did it,"" I said. ""Exactly how.""

Mika looked at the sky. The light was starting to fail, bleeding out behind the cedar line. ""It has to be dusk,"" she said. ""She always said it listens better when the light changes. When things are between.""

We waited. The slope drew a breath through the bamboo and let it out slow. A pull-cord somewhere tapped against a window frame, patient as a knock. I stood near the old braid on the granary without touching it, and it was nothing like a living thing, and it was nothing like dead.

It was something waiting to be told what to do.

Behind us, the gate rope's tassel turned a quarter turn in windless air, as if remembering which way it preferred.

""Dusk,"" Mika said, watching the light fail. ""Then we tie it. Then we teach it to close properly.""

I nodded. In my pocket, my hand found the legal pad with its five perfect dots. A circle with a center. A knot that had been left tied for thirty years while an old woman's hands grew too tired to move the rope and a priest hung a new one in the wrong place with the wrong name and told everyone it was keeping them safe.

We'd sealed something that was supposed to open and close like a lung.

Now it was holding its breath.

And it was learning to tie knots.",4,1760036295.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

A serial killer haunts the streets of a late Victorian London, but Miss Penelope Layton is more concerned with covering next month’s rent. While the city is holding its breath for the next body to drop, Penelope is preparing for a series of interviews with renowned portraitist, Peter Ledgerwood. His crowd of coquettish fans means that any article about the painter will land the front page and help her survive in this apathetic city for a little while longer. But Penelope was not prepared for the horrific stories of kidnapping, infidelity, and murder that cloud around his previous patrons—stories that Ledgerwood himself had some hand in.

 Penelope begins to fear when macabre gifts start to adorn her doorstep. One morning, she even discovers a severed lock of her own hair. But when Ledgerwood goes missing, Penelope knows that she has become the target of the ghastly rover that has come to terrify London, and the good portraitist will soon become the killer’s next victim. With both her life and livelihood at stake, Penelope must rely on recalled articles covering the case to put together the identity of the killer if she hopes to save Ledgerwood and herself from being added to the monster’s dark grammayre.

 *In Perpetuum* is a historic thriller novel with gothic elements complete at 78,000 words. The atmosphere is like Laura Purcell’s *The Silent Companions*, air thick with ghosts that whisper in Penelope’s ears, now with the added element of the city smoke. Similarly, it takes the intrigue of Tana French’s *The Hunter* and condenses the tension into a series of short interviews with an artist who has lived to see all the horror of a cannibalistic blood cult hiding in the Romanian hills, the curse that haunted a village of sharecroppers in dirt-poor Mississippi, and now a quiet journalist, who often seems herself more a ghost than living flesh. But behind the distracting smog of prose waits Penelope Layton, a smart girl haunted by her upbringing in this city, which has no care for orphans, who still struggles to live and find meaning in the living.

Words are costless things, but ink and print have a price. Time and memory are expensive materials to acquire, so we must be scrupulous in our methods, and dogged in our attempts.

A child on the street, ratty shirt stained dark in splotches by coal or smoke. Thin, sticklike figure with sullen cheeks. He cried out to the great assembled crowd, but the masses did not turn. A lie here, a half-spun truth there, all interesting, all drowned out by the shoving congregants on their way to and from, always looking forward, never looking down at the child, choking on his own voice just above the open sewer that invited him to step, slip, fall, and lay forever more at rest and quiet in his filth ridden grave. They never did look down at the children as they died in the streets. Only a few, self-interested parties would pause, pass a coin, collect the papers, and continue on, the stories of the times tucked underneath their arm. People made their way, the sun rose above London, and the smokestacks lifted to meet her.

Steam curled above a coffee cup, a miniature version of the tamed tails that marked the skyline. The length of foggy air reached higher and higher, unexpectedly broken when the boy who had ordered it reached for the cup and took a sip, wincing at the heat of the drink. He was young, only fifteen, but his quick wit and well-read family helped him when securing a job at the *Gazette*. Still, he hadn’t learned yet to sip on hot drinks, to wait patiently as it cooled and to blow lightly across the seam of the porcelain cup.

1o2eg0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1o2eg0n/just_ring_the_freaking_bell/,Just ring the freaking bell,"TLDR/TL Not Gonna R:
There's only one person scheduled for the afternoon shift at my shop. Sometimes I have to restock or clean up the back room during my shift. During these times I put out a bell and a note asking people to ring for service because I'm restocking the back. Every like third person refuses and I mean straight up refuses to ring this bell. They would rather wait 5 to 10 minutes until I come to check and its infuriating. 

I work at a small coffee shop that generally only has one barista in the afternoons/closing shift. The afternoon is usually my shift and there's quite a lot to do during it aside from just making drinks. I have lots of cleanup and restocking that I can be doing. Some of this is not just on the floor but also in back of house where we keep all our cups and other supplies in bulk.

Since it's just me in the afternoons if I'm not able to be consistently out behind the counter I generally put up a sign that says ""please ring for service"" and a little bell. My note sometimes also includes the fact that I'm restocking which is why I'd like for customers to ring the bell to alert me that they're there.

Every other person straight up refuses to ring this freaking bell. They feel bad about it for whatever reason. I don't know if they think that they're annoying me or that they're annoying customers. If they're annoying customers quite honestly I don't care and if they think they're annoying me I think that's stupid because I'm the one that put out the freaking sign! You are not doing me a favor by not ringing that bell! You're simply making me irritated because I walk out and see you and feel bad that you've been standing there for I don't even know how long waiting to order a drink!

I did try for awhile to just go check the door every time I heard it open or thought I heard it open. The issue with this is that sometimes customers are coming from the other side of the shop and I don't hear that door or they've been sitting in here for a little bit and then come up to the counter. After that I started just checking every so often. The issue though with me checking in general is that the amount of times that I'm checking makes it hard to get the work done in the back that I'm supposed to be doing. I spend so much time going back and forth to check that it takes me all day to do something that could have taken me an hour or so.

Today I put my bell out while I went back to restock and a customer came in and stood there not ringing it. My boss finally came out of her office and noticed someone standing there and hollered for me to come out because I had a customer. Like that's just embarrassing. Just ring the freaking bell 😭 

I am kind of curious if anybody has any tips of what I could do instead. We don't have cameras so I can't check on there and it's really just me. If I don't get the restock stuff done during my shift then it is brought up the next morning by my boss about how oh by the way you missed this and this or the back room was dirty. How can I get people to just ring this bell and not feel bad about it? Or even if they do feel bad about it how do I get them to just ring the bell lol",5,1760035997.0,barista,2,1.0,False

I'm on a mission to make truly authentic Arabic Qahwah (the light-roast, often cardamom-spiced coffee, not the dark Turkish style) at home. I've seen a few recipes online, but they often vary significantly, and I want to get it right.

Could anyone who makes a traditional, authentic Qahwah recipe from the Arabian Peninsula (Saudi, Emirati, Jordanian, etc.) share their ingredients and process?

Specifically, I'd love to know:

1. **Recipe and Ingredients:** What is your go-to, authentic recipe? What are the *essential* ingredients (coffee, cardamom, saffron, cloves, rose water, etc.) and in what ratios?
2. **Coffee Beans/Roast:** This is the trickiest part for me. What kind of unroasted or very lightly roasted green coffee beans are best for Qahwah? What is the ideal roast level (light/yellowish)?
3. **Where to Buy the Beans:** Where do you purchase your high-quality Qahwah-specific beans (online store recommendations, or types of local stores to look for)?

Any tips or personal anecdotes on the process would be greatly appreciated! Shukran!",0,1760035898.0,arabs,1,0.5,False

I miss you when I’m sick, when I’m down, when life gets lonely. Funny how I’ve never felt loneliness before you. I miss the person I was before you and I wish so much to go back to the person I was. I was young, naive and very hopeful. Full of light. 

You made me feel safe, like I could depend and rely on you when life gets tough. I miss feeling comfortable with you in bed. I miss cuddling with you. I miss you opening every door for me and walking me to the lifts before you drove away. I miss trying out new foods with you. I miss the coffee you made me and I miss you driving me around doing nothing. I miss shopping with you. I miss listening to music with you. I’m sad we grew so distant in the last few months and I’m so sad that we’ve had to see the ugliest sides of each other. 

I wish we never started out so ugly and I wish… you never tried molding our relationship into one that resembled the relationship you had with your ex. I wish your ex never haunted our relationship as much as it did. I wish I never allowed her to plague my mind. It was a terrible terrible time. Why did it have to start and end so terribly? I often wonder. What was the lesson I’ve yet to learn? I truly can’t figure out. All I know is I miss you so much but I know we’re bad for each other. You were right when you said we couldn’t grow with each other and we were better off apart. You knew how much I hated having to lose someone again, you don’t know how hard it’s been for me and how hard it’ll continue to be to keep myself together. 

I don’t know what’s the point in living when life only gets harder. Life seems to be a losing game. I wish I could be more emotionless about it all. I’ve never thought of death as often as I do now. The world is scary and I’ve got no one by my side to lift me up. No one by my side to tend to me when I fall. No one to call when I’m scared. Then again… you were also no longer the person I could lean on towards the end. I will never know how much of you was true. 

I never understood your ‘love’ for me as I never saw you taking initiative to interest yourself with anything I cared about. My spirituality, my belief systems, my hobbies, my love for analytical psychology and understanding humans, the shows I watched, the communities I participated in… how could you claim to love me when you never cared for anything that made me me? 

How could you ever propose marriage without having known me? How could you ever claim to have loved me when you never considered or understood what I wanted for myself? When you said you could care for me … how could you say that so flippantly when you didn’t even know who it was you were taking care of? I’m not your ex. I have different needs. 

Nonetheless… thank you for caring for me, even when you did it out of guilt for the mistakes you made in our relationship. I would have married you … not as a lover but perhaps as family and a pillar of support. I can’t say I wish we never met but I also can’t say that I’m happy to have met you.

About the documentary:

>*unseen* documents fragments of Pedro’s life as a Mexican migrant living in the United States, focusing primarily on his experiences at the intersection of disability, race, and citizenship status. As he celebrates the family ties, friendships, and acts of interdependence that sustain him, Pedro reflects on the significance of his achievements as a disabled person pressured to prove himself “worthy.” The film candidly depicts the social pressures and normative expectations disabled Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) encounter in their day-to-day lives, in addition to the constant terror and uncertainty undocumented migrants endure, which often lead to internalized ableism and emotional and psychological distress.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I had my doubts about the Resolve 062338755519 Spray 'n Wash Pre-Treat Laundry Stain Remover—doubt that quickly evaporated after just a couple of uses. It claims ""1st time stain removal,"" and, as someone whose daily grind involves tackling everything from mud-soaked toddler clothes to coffee-splattered workwear, I can vouch for the solid claim. This product was a lifesaver during a particularly chaotic barbecue weekend where ketchup, mustard, and grease decided my outfit was their new playground. Applicator in hand, I had some fun going into full pre-treat mode on those stains. Spoiler alert: they didn’t stand a chance.

**Performance That Impresses**

What really struck me about this product is its effectiveness on stains detergent alone can’t touch. Mud, wine, grass—you name it. It's not magic: some tougher stains did require a second pass. Even so, it saved more than one t-shirt I had resigned to the ""DIY project-only"" bin. The spray works in cold, hot, or warm water, so you don’t feel pressured to change your regular laundering habits. Bonus points for being compatible with most other laundry additives—good news for loyal fabric softener fans like me.

[Check Resolve 062338755519 price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b078dzyj72/)

**User-Friendly Design**

The refill pack comes in two hefty 60 fl oz bottles, meaning you won’t be running low any time soon. While the design leans utilitarian, the spray nozzle offers good coverage without making a mess—a critical feature for someone as coordination-challenged as I can be. Any awkward dripping or clogging could’ve made me switch to another product, but this bottle gave none of that nonsense.

**Key Benefits**

- Effortless removal of common stains like food and dirt.  
- Compatible with laundry routines in all temperatures.  
- Large, efficient spray bottles save multiple trips to the store.  

**Favorable Aspects**

From a price-performance perspective, the generous size and stellar functionality stand out. Compare that with hit-or-miss stain removers I’ve tried in the past—ones you keep spraying, hoping the extra squirts will somehow help. Thankfully, this is not one of those. 

**Shortcomings**

Still, nothing is flawless. This product isn’t suitable for delicate fabrics like silk or khaki, which feels slightly limiting for an all-around stain remover. A caution on the bottle also advises against letting it dry on garments—a detail I had to consciously remind myself of when multitasking.

- Not designed for delicate fabrics (silk, khaki).  
- Needs immediate laundering to avoid drying on clothes.  

**Comparing Alternative Offerings**

Spray 'n Wash goes up against stalwarts like OxiClean MaxForce and Shout Advanced Gel. While OxiClean might edge out for handling oily stains, Spray 'n Wash impressed me with its consistency across a wide range of common household messes without adjustment in washing temperature. The gel-based competitors might be more economical for pinpoint precision, but if large-area treats are routine for you, the Spray 'n Wash refill is hard to beat.

**True Value**

For what you get—ease, effectiveness, and extended use—the investment feels more than justified. I’m constantly evaluating if cleaning products pull their weight in both performance and longevity. Let’s just say I’ve already ordered another set and will likely stick with it for the foreseeable future.

Let's compare now to just 30 years ago in the mid '90s.

'90s: You could go to a restaurant and every adult would be fully present in the moment. People strike up conversations with strangers all the time in public because there isn't much else to do. For most people the news is something they see on TV or read about for 1 hour a day. People relax through boredom and get more sleep. You are fully engaged when you decide to play an album, movie, or game and none of them were addictive because they all had natural stopping points. If your partner or friends join they would also be 100% engaged in that experience with you. Even worse, all of those all used to be social to participate in. If you wanted a game, movie, or album you had to go to a store. You would get to know the staff at different stores over time and get recommendations from them. Maybe you'd make some new friends who were in the same section of the Blockbuster or with the staff at the video game store.

2025: There's way less small moments to strike up a conversations with strangers because everyone is staring at their phones. Those little in-between moments waiting at the dentist, waiting for the bus, waiting for your coffee, or waiting at the checkout counter, are now fastfowarded by most people. After years of this it has made talking with strangers in public awkward because it's no longer the norm and people rarely look up to even make eye contact. So many people are stressed and think the world is ending because they're bombarded with news constantly. People are tired and their stress is made worse because they don't get enough sleep at night from scrolling. Most enterainment is done online so you don't have a chance to meet real life friends with the same interests. People are only briefly engaged in experiences or conversations because they're just 1 short moment of boredom or 1 notification away from being distracted.

Dating in the '90s: There's a girl you keep seeing that you regularly run into at the mall, at the same isle in the music store, and at the bus stop. You have made eye contact multiple times and talked a few times briefly at the bus stop. One day you see her at the music store again so you build up the courage to strike up a conversation about music and how you'd seen her around at the mall before. She's been wanting to try dating again and gives you a chance since you both have something in common, it's not awkward at all, and you're not in a competition for her attention or in competition with people online.

Dating in 2025: There's a girl you've seen around town a few times but she's mostly been on her phone so she never saw you. The mall and music store went out of business decades ago. Both of you have been using Uber/Lyft for years now so you never had those brief conversations at the bus stop to break the ice. She uses Instagram and without even asking has 100's of guys in other countries showering her with compliments on every post. She's single and wanting to date so she does what data shows is how most people meet partners in 2025 and downloads a dating app. So now you're in competition with literally 100,000's of guys in a 100 mile radius. You awkwardly approach her saying you'd seen her around town or compliment her looks/outfit which is all you have to go by (either comes off as creepy). She's on her phone and feels annoyed and is creeped out that a stranger is suddenly bothering her in public. She turns you down because it's awkward/creepy, she just matched with a few guys on Bumble yesterday in other cities, and she thinks she's out of your league from the Instagram comments she's been receiving for years.",3,1760035189.0,nosurf,6,1.0,False

She asked if he was alone. All communication from her in the past has been innapropriate, so he was not alone- but he told her he was. 
""(Child) doesnt want to go back to your house because he's scared of (OP)....yeah, OP has threatened him and physically assaulted him."".
I have never touched my stepchild, and I didnt understand where this was even coming from, but it almost started a fight between my husband and I.

The next day was Friday- my husband's day to get SK back. His ex refused to get SK back to him, insisting that he call her first. I heard everything while she was under the impression my husband wasnt around me. 
She sat on the phone with him for 17 minutes *on the verge of tears* begging and pleading with my husband to **leave me** ""for the sake our child"". She acted like the world was ending because she was just so sad that her child was supposedly scared of me.
She said that *because of me*, SK will be at DH's dads that weekend, then will be going back to her house because she does not want SK *around me*. She kept repeating that she is not ""doing this"" because of DH **""its because of her!""**. ""I am on *your side*, I always have been, we are *a team* when it comes to (child)"". She said I threatened SK. Said there are things going on between SK and I when DH is not present. Apparently I just pushed SK in their room because he did something that I didnt like- ""she didnt wait for him to go in, she didnt gently guide him in, no she *shoved him*."". She kept repeating that SK is *terrified* of me. 
Apparently BM knows that there is *gaslighting* going on when DH is not present because SK is saying things that are abnormal for a 7 year old to say, and when asked to provide an example, BM said ""he says 'you cant put your hands on me'."". 
Then she went on to say that SK's ""exact words were X, Y, Z"" (and X,Y,Z were all emotions too big for a 7 yo to understand)

She even tried to tell my husband that I have been manipulating him since him and I got married, and she questioned him as to why he did not realize that. 

DH kept countering BM's BS with *questions*, and BM made herself look foolish.  
Why cant I hear this from SK himself? - because I am *advocating for him*.
Why hasnt SK told me anything like what youre saying? - because hes scared to get in trouble! OP is always *around*...*hovering*...*controlling* what is said.
Why does SK say he doesnt want to go to *your house*?- because he has fun at your house...but just because hes having fun doesnt mean his safety isnt in jeopardy being around OP.

When she realized her crying and begging wasnt getting anywhere, her sadness switched dramatically to anger, and it was the most manipulative thing I had ever heard.  Suddenly she was *angry at me* for having DH's last name and DH and I being a ""cute, happy little family"". Proceeded to throw insults at him until he hung up. 

She also called CPS and filed an emergency court motion. At the bottom of her handwritten emergency court motion, she wrote ""child requests to never be allowed around stepmom again."" 

Child spent the weekend at my father-in-law's because DH wasnt fully aware of his parental rights, but on sunday, DH decided that he was picking his child up. He told his dad he would be there at X time to get child. 
According to FIL, BM requested to know when DH would be at FIL's house- but DH and I didnt learn that until later on. DH went to his dads house where BM was *waiting for him* and begged him to leave me in person. Said everything she had said on the phone pretty much. All in front of my FIL. 

That was all nearly a month ago. Last week, BM texted me to badmouth DH to me. She told blatant lies about how him and his family supposedly treated her badly. Acted like she was my friend. 
My husband took SK to football practice later that day and BM met him there. 
She texted me afterwards to tell me that she talked to my husband for a bit, and asked me if I wanted to get coffee with her sometime. No, I didnt want to get coffee with her, but I didn't tell her no for the sake of remaining cordial.

I learned that night that when she ""talked to my husband for a bit"" (like she  told me she did), she told him that she talked to someone I went to high school with, and that she knows all about me and the records I have with all 3 of my names. Mentioned 3 times that I've had 3 different names. (I've been married & divorced,  and high school was 10 years ago). Then she asked my husband if he was staying with me. 

She texted me the next day and asked if I could get coffee with her *that day*. I said no, I wasnt comfortable after she said X, Y, and Z about me to my husband. 

She sent *long paragraphs* to me, still acting like she was my friend. Said she wasnt badmouthing me in a bad way. Said she wants to *understand* me better so she can learn *why I act out towards my husband* (I dont?)- and she suggested several times that my husband and I seek couples therapy...? I blocked her number. 

I am fed up with her meddling in my husband's life, and thinking she holds a high and mighty position in his life. He was never married to her and suspects that she intentionally  baby trapped him.

I cannot wait to have this man's baby and show her where she stands in his life.

Most evenings are simple: coffee, soft music, and a good show. I enjoy small chats about how the day went, sharing songs, laughing at funny scenes, and making little plans we actually do.

I like anime and K-dramas (Naruto and Demon Slayer are favorites), Turkish shows, and story-driven movies. I listen to all kinds of music and love finding new tracks for late-night playlists. I cook simple meals, enjoy hiking, quiet walks, stargazing, and I’d pick a museum or café over a party any day. I used to game a lot, now it’s just Genshin once in a while.

I (36M) just made my final credit card payment of $1,500 today, and I’m officially debt-free for the first time in about 15 years. Honestly, I’m not even sure how to feel yet — it almost doesn’t feel real.

I’ve had credit card debt for most of my adult life. Sometimes it was just a few thousand, but during COVID it climbed to about $15K. By the end of 2022, I was at around **$35K** — all credit card debt. That same year, I got divorced (no kids), and I lost my job. I worked a couple of part-time jobs that barely covered the basics and relied heavily on my cards. I fell into a deep depression.

I applied for hundreds of jobs before finally landing one with decent pay, benefits, and a 401(k). That gave me a chance to start rebuilding. I have a one bedroom apartment with just basic furnishings. Over the past two years, I’ve thrown everything I could toward my debt — overtime, bonuses, and bits of side income. I cut back hard and stayed frugal: cooking and making coffee at home, canceling subscriptions, and buying only what I really needed.

At the end of 2024, I transferred my last $10,000 onto a Bank of America card with 0% interest until December 2025. I paid the 3% transfer fee, but I think the 0% made me a little too comfortable, and by July I still had about $7,000 left. So for the past three months, I’ve been throwing everything I could at it — and today, I made the final $1,500 payment, two months before the promo expires.

I still struggle with depression. The past few months I’ve felt drained, burned out, and honestly had some really dark moments. I relocated to a new town and haven’t made many connections yet. I don’t have much family either. I started seeing a therapist a couple of months ago, and I truly feel like it’s been saving my life. I’m hoping being debt-free will finally give me some breathing room.

Now that the debt is gone, I want to focus on rebuilding my life — building a full emergency fund, investing, saving more for retirement, and hopefully traveling and doing more of the things I’ve been putting off for years.

If you’re in debt, please stay consistent and make a plan, but also take care of yourself along the way.

Sorry — I meant for this to be a short post. This sub has been so helpful and inspiring, and I don’t really have anyone to share this with. So thank you for reading if you made it to the end.",40,1760034918.0,debtfree,4,1.0,False

1o2dxtg,https://i.redd.it/y5ywt2deq4uf1.jpeg,How Much Water Should You Drink to Lose Weight?,"**Guest Writer:** Alison Martinez

When people talk about weight loss, most focus on calories, workouts, or diet plans - but one of the simplest and most overlooked tools is **water**. Staying hydrated plays a major role in how your body burns fat, regulates hunger, and performs during exercise. Let’s break down what science says about how much water you should actually drink to support weight loss.



**Why Water Matters for Weight Loss**

Water isn’t just something you drink when you’re thirsty. It’s involved in nearly every function in your body - from digestion to energy production to fat metabolism. When you’re even slightly dehydrated, your body slows down, and your hunger cues can become confused with thirst.

In several studies, people who increased their water intake ate fewer calories and lost more body fat over time. Drinking water before meals can help reduce appetite, boost metabolism temporarily, and make workouts more effective.



**How Water Helps You Lose Weight**

# 1. Boosts Metabolism

A study published in the *Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism* found that drinking **16 ounces (about 500 mL)** of water increased metabolic rate by **30% for about 30-40 minutes**. That means your body burns more calories just from being hydrated.



# 2. Reduces Appetite

Sometimes we think we’re hungry when we’re really just thirsty. Drinking a glass of water before meals can help you eat less. In a clinical study, adults who drank water before each meal consumed fewer calories and lost more weight than those who didn’t.  


# 3. Improves Exercise Performance

Water helps regulate body temperature, lubricate joints, and prevent fatigue during workouts. If you’re exercising to lose weight, dehydration can make your workouts feel harder and shorten your endurance. Staying hydrated means you’ll burn more calories and recover faster.



# 4. Supports Fat Breakdown

The process of metabolizing stored fat - called **lipolysis** \- begins with hydrolysis, which literally means “breaking down with water.” Without enough hydration, your body can’t efficiently release or burn stored fat.

  


**How Much Water Should You Drink?**

The amount of water you need depends on your body weight, activity level, and climate. 



Here’s a simple rule of thumb:

**Drink at least half your body weight (in pounds) in ounces of water per day.**

For example:

* If you weigh 180 pounds → aim for about **90 ounces** (roughly 11 cups).
* If you’re more active, add **8-16 ounces** for every 30 minutes of exercise.

  
You can also use this hydration formula backed by research:💧 **30-35 mL of water per kilogram of body weight per day.**That’s about **2.5-3.5 liters (85–120 ounces)** for most adults.

If you live in **Texas**, where heat and humidity are high, you’ll naturally need more water -especially if you exercise outdoors.

  


**Signs You’re Not Drinking Enough**

Even mild dehydration can slow your weight loss progress. Watch for:

* Dry mouth or lips
* Dark yellow urine
* Headaches
* Low energy or dizziness
* Sugar cravings or “false hunger”

If you notice these symptoms, it’s your body’s way of asking for more water.

  


**What About Other Drinks?**

While coffee, tea, and even fruits and veggies contribute to hydration, **water should be your primary source**. Avoid sugary drinks, sodas, or juices that add calories without nutrients. Sparkling water and herbal teas can help mix things up if plain water feels boring.

Adding electrolytes can also help if you sweat heavily during workouts, but be mindful of sodium and sugar levels in sports drinks.

  


**Quick Tips to Stay Hydrated**

✅ Keep a refillable water bottle nearby all day.

✅ Drink one glass right when you wake up.

✅ Have a glass before every meal.

✅ Flavor your water with lemon, cucumber, or mint.

✅ Set hydration reminders on your phone or smartwatch.

Making hydration a habit keeps your metabolism active and your appetite in check - both key for long-term fat loss.

  


**Can You Drink Too Much Water?**

Yes, but it’s rare. Overhydration (called hyponatremia) usually only happens if you drink excessive amounts in a short time without electrolytes. The goal is steady hydration throughout the day - not chugging gallons all at once.

  


**The Bottom Line**

Water won’t magically melt fat on its own, but it makes every other part of your weight loss plan work better. It helps you eat less, move more, and burn calories efficiently.

  
Start with this simple goal:Drink a glass of water before every meal, and at least 8-10 cups a day. Pair that with regular exercise and a balanced diet, and you’ll be on your way to lasting results.

My husband and I (and our two cats!) just moved to Paris from California last week. I’m a 34-year-old Korean woman, and my husband is American. We’re still getting settled in, but I’d really love to meet some female friends here, especially other expats or anyone who enjoys good coffee, a nice drink, and exploring the city.

A little about me: I used to live in China, so I speak fluent Chinese 🇨🇳. I love traveling, fashion, cats (of course!), and recently got into running 🏃‍♀️. I’d love to find some like-minded women to grab coffee or drinks with, go for a weekend run, or just hang out and chat about life in Paris.

If you’re also new here (or just open to meeting new people), I’d love to connect! 😊",4,1760034771.0,SocialParis,5,0.75,False

Back in June I had hemorrhoids that flared up so bad that it was making it hard to have a bowel movement and my stools would come out like pebbles and really hard. That lasted for like a week. I fixed it by using suppositories and and not straining. Well now the hemorrhoids are back with a vengeance and now they are making it feel like there’s something blocking my stool. And they have started coming out thinner. I’m taking still softeners and I noticed when I drink my daily coffee it causes diarrhea but even then it still feels like it’s not all coming out because my stomach will still have cramps. My hemorrhoids are huge and I can feel then popped out only when I’m sitting on the toilet . I’m so scared and losing sleep over this,3,1760034760.0,hemorrhoid,7,1.0,False

1o2duvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/schenectady/comments/1o2duvc/i_need_a_ride_to_atlanta_and_back_in_the_near/,I need a ride to Atlanta and Back in the near future,"Long story short, I was living in Atlanta with my best buddy, who suddenly died, thereby instantly rendering me homeless. I was forced to sell my old car, then pile all my belongings into storage, and travel the country to survive and stay sheltered. It took years and thousands of travel miles to finally get into proper housing, here in Schenectady.

In the process, my life saving ran out. Mostly spent on costly hotels and motels and apartment move in costs. So now I'm pretty much broke, and living on my SS benefits at age 62. I don't have a car and my drivers license expired. I can't possibly afford a moving company.

I absolutely can NOT bear to lose precious sentimental items I left behind. On top of that, there are personal private things, and legal documents etc I can't allow to fall into strangers hands, by abandoning the unit.

Lastly, I dread flying., airfare ain't cheap, and I have prostate problems, possibly cancer. So... I'm kinda up the creek here, and I'm thinking maybe someone with a pickup or cargo van might help me out.

I'm willing to pay $3,000 (In monthly installments - $300/month) I would cover the initial gas and tolls and hotel room cost for maybe 2 nights.

16-18 hours drive down, a couple hours to pull my stuff out of storage, toss 90% in the dumpster and county dump if necessary, sort and rebox what I want to keep, then haul ass back to NY.

I have to get this monkey off my back. I'm paying $300/month storage rent and I must close this chapter to get on with my life here in NY.

If you can recommend an easier cheaper way, I'm all ears. But maybe you could use 3K and would like to take a fun road trip with me in November or December, assuming the weather is fair. If not, guess I'll keep paying the storage bill into spring 2026. But there's no way in hell I'm letting my shit wind up on Storage Wars TV show.

Ok so, let's say 40 hours total driving time, 2-3 days work, you earn 3K, payable over the next 10 months. I will **not** stiff you. I've been paying 300/month storage rent for like 10 YEARS now. Another 10 months paying YOU instead of THEM, would feel like getting a mafia loan shark off my back. And if I'm not paying YOU, I will be paying them, for as long as it takes to finish the never ending nightmare I've been living, which I'll be happy to tell you about in the time we have together.

I know it sounds like a big hassle, but this kind of operation was easy peasy for me in my trucking years. If you've got good driving skill and stamina, it'll be a stroll in the park.

Coffee's on me, smokers welcome.

edit: Forgot to say I'll pay 500 cash up front on top of covering the gas, tolls, hotel etc.

Has any other store implemented this rule near you? Are managers able to do this?

I’m NOT mad by the way! I was just in shock because I have never been able to find these and I’m grateful- because of the rule, maybe that was the only reason I was able to purchase when I went. What are your thoughts? 😏",41,1760034538.0,DollarTree,19,0.84,False

Hi guys!! Before today’s chapter, let’s take the time to answer some questions, like last time:

* How does one tell an itinerant from a normal person? Ha, well this one’s pretty easy. First of all they smell, like a lot, and not the pleasant kind. Second but just as easily noticeable, they don’t have the City’s welcome.
* How would one go about acquiring one of the couriers? Hmm, not quite sure about that one, I know they belong to the ministry of City infrastructure, but they’re actually made by the Penguin’s Retainers. So I suppose joining one of those two agencies would be the easiest.



They changed the professor for this morning’s class. The new teach is a youngish guy, mid 40s, with glasses, a short, stubble beard, and is wearing a pretty dapper suit.

Thankfully, none of the dance we had to do for the last teach happened here. This one just came in, bearing a warm, comforting smile, and immediately went on to present his material. Today’s class was on how modern captation devices have irrevocably affected our cultures. Pretty hot topic, but I can tell most of the class doesn’t care whatsoever about it, my two lab partners are gaming on their laptops, a girl across from me is playing Sims, a guy to my right is playing some kind of sports game, ect.



I’ve been cold this whole class. Despite wearing one of my signature linen shirts and getting the sleeves all the way to my wrists, I’ve been in this almost bone rattling shivering state. It sucks because I really am trying to focus and participate in the lecture, but it’s getting harder and harder to do so. I eventually start yawning too, much to my annoyance. I hope the professor doesn’t think I’m bored. The cold is just making me super tired, the kind where you struggle to even keep your eyes fully open, and can’t focus on anything.



Break time finally comes, and definitely not too early. Since this is a three hours class, we always have a ten to fifteen minutes break around the middle. I quickly shuffle out of the classroom, making my way to the bathroom to splash water over my face. The warmth of the building hits me like a tidal wave. Has it really been this hot outside of the classroom the whole time? The sudden heat radiates through my body, invigorating my bones and toasting my flesh, rekindling my energy for the day ahead. Filled with a newfound determination, I even walk to the cafeteria and buy myself an extra cup of coffee. I can now tell today is going to be great.



Sitting back in class, the current lecture is rather slow. Turning to my classmates, I throw in a comment to pass the time: “So, this afternoon I have a board game lab for rituals class, crazy huh?”

“Wait, you’re also in that class?” One of them responds.

“The one with Ms Spencter? Yeah, you guys too, hells yeah!”

“Shit man, we gotta go together then, not lose each other in the crowd.”



We keep chatting about the kinks of rituals class for a bit, and how funny it was when the teacher had a lecturer come in last week and didn’t even show up to her own class. Eventually the class finishes, pretty flatly at that. The teacher eventually asks to discuss last week’s lecture, but upon seeing no one interested, he gives up and bids us all farewell. Getting up with my two new friends, we decide to go eat out, given our next class is in two hours. 

“So, are we going to the cafeteria?” I ask.

“Are you kidding man? The food there sucks and is expensive as fuck. I know a good spot in Chinatown, let’s go there”

“Fine by me” the third, Matt, says.

“Ok then”



Not knowing the layout of this part of the City, I follow them through long roads, littered with strange cars and stanger people still. We even pass by a truck with skeletons ornamenting its roof. I regret not having snapped a picture of it. People get a tad overzealous when Samhain is coming around here. 



We finally arrive at the gates of Chinatown. They’re exactly what you’d expect. Two large red stone pillars with a roof guarded by stern looking stone lions. I hope none of us will offense the sentinels, as I don’t exactly want to get crushed by rock fangs the size of my forearm. 

Thankfully, nothing happens as we cross them, and we enter the bustling undercity filled with shops and even more restaurants. Our classmate guiding us here, William, leads us through a couple alleys before arriving in front of a dumpling restaurant. “Now, trust me boys, this place is sick. I always come here with my girlfriend. In fact she’d be mad if she knew I was going today.”



Sitting down at our table, we decide to order four different servings of dumplings and simply shared them to have a feast, then split the bill. As we wait for our food to arrive, Matt strikes up a conversation. “So, Colin, where do you live?” 

“Somewhere on King’s Hill.”

“Aaah, I could never make heads or tail of that place, how do you even navigate through the glades without getting lost in the trees?”

“You just have to know your way around it, I suppose. Anyways what about you ?”

“I live off the north coast.”

“That’s super far away man! Must suck commuting here”

“It sure does man, it sure does.”



Our food eventually arrives. Spoiler alert, it’s tasty as all the hells. It’s those kind of fried dumplings where there’s an extra veil of skin over the whole dish you have to break to access individual pieces, but you also eat the skin as it’s very tasty. We chat away as we eat, spilling sauces a couple of times, but it’s a good time so no one cares. We even ordered some spicy cucumbers to come with it, so we’re eating good. 



As we eat, I notice the table left of us seems to get larger, and larger, and larger. When we sat down, it was only a table for four, and there were four people sitting at it. But now, looking back, there’s eleven people, sitting and eating and chatting, acting as though nothing changed. The weirdest part is, there was no extra place when we arrived. As in, the table for 4 took up all the space that was available there, yet it seems to keep growing without getting cramped or touching the walls.



As we get up to pay and leave, I look back, one last time. There seems to be at least fifty people now, and the ambience is even more drastic. They’re singing and drinking and flaying their arms like in some sort of over-exaggerated feast celebration. There’s even frantic music in the background, you know the kind, with fast drums and high pitched flutes, weaving a melody of animality and cravings.

I decide to not get involved any further, as even noticing things can sometimes upset the old folk, and just pay then sign goodbye to the server.



Heading back towards the comforting feeling of the university, I try not to think too hard about what happened in the restaurant. There’s a good chance they didn’t notice me staring after all, and even if they did, they don’t know anything about me.

“So, should we go to the materials workshop to rent out the captation tool then?” I ask, trying to sound casual.

“Oh sure, good riddance, let’s go.”



Since I’d never been to the aforementioned materials workshop, they lead me through the university’s ever strange architecture. Picture this, all red brick floors and wooden walls. Winding corridors in no recognizable shapes, like an L shaped one leading into a plus shaped alleyway, leading into a roundabout with seemingly nothing in the middle, and so on and so forth. And navigating it makes even less sense, we travel multiple halls and stairways for about 10 minutes only to end up exactly 2 floors above where we originally started.



And that’s when we reach the entrance of the material labs wing. It’s a \*drastic\* change of atmosphere. We leave the cozy red bricks and warm colours, and enter a surgical, cold, environment of pure white walls and floors, heavy metal doors protected by keypads, and large blue arrows on the walls reading “SECTION - 1A”. For a moment, it really feels as though we’ve been unwillingly transported into some kind of secret government facility. 

But it wasn’t, and we keep going. Walking through ever more hallways, we end up in front of a large reception desk, almost 50 meters in length, all a light blue, in stark contrast to the white of everything else.



Stepping up to it, a small, grey, man comes to greet us.

“What can I do you for?” he ask, in a nasally, annoying voice.

“We’ve come for information regarding renting out captation material for one of our classes.” Matt announces, deciding he’d take the lead on the questioning, something I’m 100% okay with.

“That’s,.. that’s… hold on, too much questions, what do you need?”

“um, we’d just like to know if we can rent it during our week off for the project, and if we can make the reservations now,... sir?” Matt seems, understandably, shaken by the man’s strange reactions.

“What,... what class, I don’t understand,.., YOUR QUESTIONS” he suddenly shouts, catching all of us by surprise.

“Now what’s going on here” A large man, strong and bearded, walks in from behind the grey man. Seemingly he heard the commotion.

“Their questions, I don’t understand THEM, I HATE I HATE-”

“I’ll take care of it, go back to your pit now” the newcomer cuts him off, a little dryly.

“Sorry about that, what is it you boys need?”

“Um, well, like I said we’d just like to know if we can rent out the device during our week off, and if we can reserve it now.” Matt responds, a little shyly.

“Oh absolutely you can, what class is it for?”

“CMC1801, Captation techniques, sir”

“Alriiiiiiight, and, yep, that’s all good, you can even do it now if you want”

“Thanks a lot sir, and sorry for bothering you, we’ll be on our way now”.



Being all still confused at what just happened, we decide to just grab the website to reserve later, and promptly fuck-right-off from the place, excuse my french. We realize time has gone anyways and we need to be on our way to our upcoming rituals lab class, especially since it’s in a special lab classroom we have never been to before. Looking at the (very confusing) university grounds map, we head through even more stairs, halls, and barely working elevators.

Eventually, we arrive in front of a set of heavy, iron doors protected by a keypad.

“Rooms A-100 to A-200, that should be it” I declare “Anyone got a working keycard?”

“I do, says Anthony, lemme take a crack at this”

The keycard reader flashes green, but the doors remain tight shut. Well shit.



“We could try looking around this floor for another way in?” William says.

“That works, I sorta know my way around it, had a couple classes here years ago” Matt explains.

Following him, we go up a five steps staircase, and arrive to yet another great hall, full of students I’d never seen before. Keep in mind that there was a great hall of the same scale just one floor beneath. Even weirder, despite us now being quite high above ground level, there’s large glass doors to the side of the place that lead to an inner court with slides and tunnels, kid’s toys. Seeing as the others barely acknowledge those, however, I keep my mouth shut and keep following them.



Suddenly, Anthony stops and turns to us. “Wait, I know exactly where we are, do you guys want to go check out the gym?”

“The gym? sure I guess, I respond, where is it?”

“Sub-basement 2, right where we are, there’s an elevator right here” he points.

We walk up to the elevator, ring it, wait, wait some more, about five minutes, then decide we don’t have time for it and move on, disappointed. “Man, you guys would’ve loved it, it’s in a cube and all”



We finally find the way to the lab. It was in fact simply inside the library itself, something we’d not thought of first. Walking inside the library, I take notice of a large monolith that looks like an oversized pink brick, with “Metamorphose” written on it. There’s a sort of muted hum that can be heard when close to it. But as there’s no time to ponder over that, we simply make our way to the classroom.

[Whatever's up with that, and why does it have a QR code of all things ?](https://preview.redd.it/jlrx6ychp4uf1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6de79c0ed9df4c5bbbcab2f3e430115ce7b9c672)

  


The class itself is a little boring, though I can’t exactly blame the teacher for that. She almost attempts to explore how different ritual constructs interact with each other, and our cultural understanding of them, but always stops short of actually explaining it, probably due to fear of being scolded by the headmasters if I had to guess. The theoretical part lasts about two hours, then we move on to the lab. Our group is assigned a form of intent based, linguistic-shaping, ritual. We essentially have to play cards while explaining their meaning and expressing an intent for another person. We achieve varying levels of success, being able to completely freeze one person, then freeing them through the next player’s wish. It’s cute but kinda useless when you realize it only affects people who willingly decide to play the “game”, and that any effects are completely erased when the ritual is dismissed. But I suppose it’s a nice learning experience.



When class ends, we gather our stuff, and try to leave the library. I, however, am held in place and an electronic beeping is heard. A tall, handsome man looking to be in his mid fifties, comes out of the security office and calls out to me.   
“Hey, have any books from other libraries in your backpack?”

“err, yeah, I got one from the King’s Hill library in there” I hope no one notices it’s a romantasy. It’s cringe but it’s one of my favourite genres, what can I do.

“Alright, just hand it to me and pass through the gates, I’ll give it back to you on the other side.”



I comply, passing the gates with no issues this time. I see him again, popping right on the other side, as he’d said he would.

“Here you go, son.”

“Thanks, uhh, sir?”

“Name’s Wellers, Mo Wellers, always happy to help young scholars like you. Now, give me a call if you ever meet a widow in that little shop of yours”



I try to ask him how i’d call him or how he even knew where I worked, but when I look up after putting my book away, he’s gone.

*By Your Humorously Analytical Sports Oracle*

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

Southern Miss (-3.5, -160 ML) enters as the favorite, and the math backs it up. Their 31.0 PPG offense and 39.7 PPG defense (yes, leaky, but functional) suggest a team that *can’t stop scoring* and *can’t stop leaking*. Georgia Southern (+3.5, +135 ML), meanwhile, is a statistical trainwreck: allowing 37.4 PPG and 481 total yards per game. Their defense is the NFL’s “worst team” but with worse coffee.

The Over/Under is 59.5 (-110), and both teams have a *habit* of lighting up the scoreboard. Southern Miss’s last four games averaged 59 PPG; Georgia Southern’s last five allowed 42.8 PPG. The Over is a 7/10 bet on a night when neither defense has a functioning “no” button.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Roster Moves, and Other “Oh No” Moments

Southern Miss’ QB Braylon Braxton is a magician with a football—11 TDs, 3 INTs, and a 64.9% completion rate. RB Jeffery Pittman (4 TDs in 5 games) is the guy who’ll punch through Georgia Southern’s defense, which ranks **dead last in FBS** in rushing yards allowed (262.6 YPG). Their defense is so porous, they’d let a toddler with a wheelbarrow score a TD.

Georgia Southern’s QB JC French is competent (7 TDs, 3 INTs), but his weapons—like WR Camden Brown (5 TDs, 19.6 YPC)—can’t outrun the fact that their defense is a sieve. Their last loss? A 35-10 drubbing where they allowed 331 rushing yards. If their D were a colander, it’d need a “Do Not Enter” sign.

1o2dmin,https://i.redd.it/qpk801znn4uf1.jpeg,17 Common First Aid Myths That Hurt People & What the Red Cross Recommends Instead,"

After 25 years as a Canadian Red Cross Training Partner, I’ve heard many fascinating and horrifying anecdotes about how best to give first aid to the sick or injured. I’ve also been amazed at how some people have survived despite the unconventional treatment they’ve received from well-meaning bystanders.

There are many ways to provide first aid. Some are effective, while others are downright reckless. In this article, I’d like to dispel some of the most popular myths surrounding this topic. With each myth listed below, I’ve provided the current first aid recommendations according to guidelines from the Red Cross.

Emergency Medical Services has been abbreviated as EMS. I’ve omitted the phone number as it varies between countries. Ensure you and your loved ones know your local EMS phone number.

Based on my experience and reviews from Red Cross resources, I will cover 17 important first-aid issues in this story and distill critical information to give you valuable content for use.

**1. Heart Attack**

**Myth: You must make a person lie down if they’re having a heart attack.**

A heart attack usually happens when a sudden blockage in the heart prevents oxygenated blood from reaching an area of the heart muscle. It is not necessary to make a person lie down. They will put themselves in a position they find most comfortable. For first aid for heart attack:

1. Call EMS and have the person rest comfortably, either sitting or lying, to ease the strain on the heart. Encourage them to sit on the floor leaning against a sturdy object like a chair or the wall. They can’t fall off the floor and are less likely to hurt themselves if they collapse.

2. If Aspirin (ASA) is available, encourage the person to chew one 325 mg or two 80 mg ASA tablets unless the person has an allergy or a contraindication to ASA, such as a bleeding disorder. Ensure that the person thoroughly chews and swallows the ASA. Do not repeat the dosage.

3. If the person takes a prescribed medication like nitroglycerin to relieve chest pain, offer to fetch the medication and help the person to take it. If the person has nitroglycerin in a spray or pill form, ensure they spray or place it under their tongue.

4. Reassure the person. Anxiety may increase the person’s discomfort.

**2. Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs)**

An AED is a small, portable electronic device that automatically diagnoses life-threatening heart rhythms and can treat them through defibrillation — the application of an electrical shock. The shock stops the arrhythmia, allowing the heart to re-establish an effective rhythm.

**Myth: AEDs are complicated to use.**

Although AEDs may appear complicated, they are easy to use. Press the power button, and the machine will talk to you and tell you what to do. If you can apply the electrical pads to the person’s chest within three minutes and deliver a shock if required, you will significantly increase their chances of survival.

A defibrillator will not deliver a shock if a casualty does not need it, so you cannot harm the person. However, to give the person the best chance of survival, you must provide quality CPR (chest compressions with rescue breathing). CPR pumps oxygenated blood to the heart and brain, keeping the person alive until advanced medical care arrives. Therefore, learning how to give quality CPR and use an AED is essential.

**3. Sprains**

A sprain occurs when a ligament is stretched, torn, or damaged.

**Myth: You should apply heat to a muscle, bone, or joint injury to speed healing.**

Applying heat dilates (widens) the blood vessels in the area, bringing more blood to the area and increasing swelling. Therefore, heat is not the best treatment for an acute muscle, bone, or joint injury.

Applying cold constricts (narrows) to the blood vessels reduces blood flow to the area and helps reduce swelling. In addition, it slows the nerve impulses and helps to relieve pain. For first aid for sprains:

If the injury seems severe or the person is in significant pain, call EMS.

If a person has a suspected sprained joint, encourage them to see their healthcare provider to confirm that they do not have a fracture.

When treating an injury, apply cold initially. For a sprain, apply a cold pack for about 20 minutes. Use the RICE treatment of Rest, Immobilize, Cold, and Elevation for the first 24 hours.

Ice decreases blood flow, so expect less swelling and inflammation. However, if the swelling doesn’t go down, the person should see a doctor.

**4 . Fainting**

Fainting is a brief period of unconsciousness that occurs when the brain is not receiving adequate blood flow. If someone suddenly becomes unresponsive and “comes to” after about a minute, the person may have simply fainted.

**Myth: If someone feels faint, get them to put their head between their legs**

If a person who is feeling lightheaded puts their head between their legs, there’s a risk they might fall forward and injure themselves. A person may become pale, dizzy, nauseous, or sweaty before fainting. If you think that someone is about to faint, have them lie down. For first aid for fainting:

If the person loses consciousness, roll them onto their side and place them in the recovery position.

Call EMS and get an AED if the person has been unresponsive for more than a few minutes, is pregnant, has an unknown medical history, or you suspect that the person fainted as a result of a serious injury or illness. If you are unsure, call EMS and get an AED.

Encourage the person to follow up with their healthcare provider.

**5. Nosebleeds**

**Myth: Leaning backward stops a nosebleed**

Getting a person to tilt their head back will not stop a nosebleed. The blood will go down their throat instead of flowing out of the nose, which could lead to choking, stomach irritation, and vomiting. First aid for nosebleeds:

Have the person sit with the head slightly forward. Have them firmly pinch the nostrils below the bony bridge for 10 to 15 minutes until the bleeding stops. Don’t put tissues or gauze into the nose to stop a nosebleed; do not pinch the nose if the person has a severe head injury.

Once the bleeding has stopped, advise the person to avoid blowing, rubbing, or picking their nose because this could start the bleeding again.

If the person loses responsiveness, put them in the recovery position to help the blood drain from their nose and call Emergency Medical Services.

**6. Bleeding**

**Myth: Coffee grounds stop bleeding**

Applying coffee grounds to a wound to stop bleeding can lead the wound to become infected. It also makes it very hard for healthcare providers to clean out a wound requiring stitches. Bleeding that can’t be stopped at home likely needs medical care. For first aid to stop bleeding:

Apply firm, direct pressure to the wound

While maintaining direct pressure, apply a dressing and bandage it in place.

If blood soaks through the bandage, put another bandage on top.

If direct pressure does not control the bleeding, consider using a tourniquet.

**7. Burns**

Burns are soft tissue injuries caused by heat, chemicals, electricity, or radiation.

**Myth: For heat burns, apply ice or butter.**

Putting ice or butter directly on a burned area will worsen the burn. Ice applied directly to burned skin can increase skin damage. Any greasy substance on a burn insulates the area and drives the burn into the flesh. It slows healing and makes it harder for a doctor to treat the burned area.

First aid for burns caused by heat:

Cool the affected area with water or a clean, cool (but not freezing compress) for at least 10 minutes.

Remove jewelry and clothing from the burn site, but do not attempt to move anything stuck to the skin.

Cover the burn loosely with a dry, sterile dressing. If the burn begins to blister, change colour, or look infected, get medical treatment. Always seek medical attention for second or third-degree burns.

**8. Hypothermia**

Hypothermia is a serious condition that occurs when a person’s body loses heat faster than it can produce it, and the body temperature becomes dangerously low.

**Myth: A shot of alcohol can warm a hypothermic patient.**

Alcohol may give a pleasant feeling of warmth but dilates the blood vessels, which causes more heat loss, not less. Alcohol delays the onset of shivering — a mechanism that produces heat — and reduces its duration. It can also affect a person’s judgment and coordination, two conditions to avoid.

Hypothermia slows a person’s breathing, so you’ll need to spend a little longer than usual checking their ABCs. If the person is unresponsive and you suspect hypothermia, check for signs of breathing for 60 seconds. First aid for hypothermia:

Call EMS and get an AED if the person has moderate to severe hypothermia.

Handle the person gently to avoid triggering ventricular fibrillation and keep them lying down. Only move the person if it is necessary. Take care not to jostle or bump them.

Remove wet clothing, providing the area is sheltered from the cold environment.

Prevent further heat loss by replacing the person’s wet clothes with dry ones and warming them in a sheltered area.

Add layers of clothing and a hat or other head covering. Focus on warming the core first.

If the person is conscious and able to swallow, have them drink warm, sweet fluids.

Have the severely hypothermic patient rest and stay still until they are sufficiently warm unless you have special training in rapid or active re-warming techniques.

Putting two hypothermic people together in the same sleeping bag is not a good way to warm them. One person must have a normal body temperature. It is better to wrap such a hypothermic person in clothing inside a sleeping bag and allow him to shiver, which generates heat.

**9. Frostbite**

Frostbite is damage to the skin caused by extreme cold.

**Myth: When someone has frostbite, you should rub the frozen area or apply snow.**

When providing care for frostbite, don’t rub the frozen area or put snow on it. If you rub the skin, ice crystals inside the cells may damage the tissues. Rubbing snow on the area will only worsen the condition.

Do not run hot water over frozen skin to warm it. Doing this increases the risk of skin damage if the water is too hot. For the first aid for frostbite:

1. If possible, remove jewelry or other extraneous material that may restrict blood flow to the affected area.

2. Thaw the area only if you are sure it will not freeze again.

3. Warm the affected area using warm water, if available (approximately 38 to 40°C (100.4 to 104°F)) or body heat (e.g., by placing the person’s hands in their armpits or on the abdomen). You should be able to put your own hands in the water for a minute without feeling too warm.

4. If the frozen area has thawed, don’t break any blisters. Protect them with loose, dry dressings. If they are affected, place gauze between the fingers or toes.

5. If possible, elevate any thawed extremities above the level of the heart.

6. Thawing frostbite can be extremely painful, so the person may wish to take an over-the-counter painkiller. 7. Rehydrate the person by providing plenty of fluids. 8. Encourage the person to seek medical attention.

**10. Hyperventilating**

Hyperventilation is rapid, uncontrolled breathing.

**Myth: If someone is hyperventilating, you should have them breathe into a paper bag.**

It’s a traditional practice to treat hyperventilation by breathing into a paper bag, also known as “rebreathing,” When a person hyperventilates, they expel carbon dioxide too rapidly. Rebreathing exhaled air helps restore the lost gas and restore proper oxygen levels.

Several medical conditions, like asthma and heart attacks, look like hyperventilation and can cause confusion. In these cases, reducing oxygen and increasing carbon dioxide can be fatal.

One study described three cases in which people having heart attacks mistakenly thought they were hyperventilating and died after losing oxygen while they were breathing into bags. Breathing into a paper bag is unsafe; doctors do not recommend it.

For first aid for hyperventilation, the best treatment is encouraging the person to stay calm and take slow, controlled breaths. If the hyperventilation doesn’t stop, get medical assistance.

**11. Seizures**

A seizure is a sudden period of uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain that causes short-lived abnormalities in muscle tone or body movements, behaviour, sensations, or level of consciousness.

Myth: You should put something between the teeth of a person having a seizure to prevent them from biting or swallowing their tongue.

This practice is unsafe and unnecessary. It is impossible to swallow one’s tongue. Although the person may bite down on the tongue, causing it to bleed, this is a minor problem compared to the risks of attempting to put an object in the person’s mouth.

The person could chip a tooth or knock a tooth loose, creating a choking hazard. The person may also bite down with enough force to break the object and then choke on one of the pieces. Additionally, attempting to place an object in the person’s mouth puts you at risk of being bitten. First aid for seizure:

Roll the person onto their side if you can do so safely to keep an open airway.

Remove any hazards and, if possible, put a pillow underneath the head.

Do not try to hold the person down or stop the seizure from happening.

Call EMS if:

you don’t know the person or the person’s medical history.

the seizure lasts more than a few minutes.

the person has several seizures, one after another.

the person is injured.

the person is pregnant.

the person is experiencing a diabetic emergency.

the seizure happens in the water.

this is the person’s first seizure, or you don’t know what caused the seizure.

the person fails to wake up after the seizure or is unresponsive for a long time.

Protect the person from injury by:

Moving furniture and other objects that could cause injury out of the way.

Protecting the person’s head with a soft object (such as a blanket).

**12. Fever**

**Myth: Rubbing alcohol brings down a fever.**

Wiping rubbing alcohol on your skin makes the skin feel cooler but doesn’t cool the body or reduce fever. Also, alcohol can be absorbed through the skin. For small children and infants, in particular, giving a child a sponge bath with rubbing alcohol can lead to alcohol poisoning. First aid for fever:

Give the person a medicine that reduces fever and contains ibuprofen or acetaminophen.

Call the person’s healthcare provider if you don’t know what to do or if the fever doesn’t go away.

**13. Swallowed poisons**

**Myth: Induce vomiting in a poisoned person.**

When a person has swallowed a poisonous substance, you might think vomiting it would help, but making them vomit can cause additional harm, and doctors do not recommend it. Sometimes, the person may vomit on their own.

In the past, people used a medicine called Ipecac Syrup to cause vomiting. However, this is not encouraged. A corrosive substance will damage the esophagus on the way down and again on the way up as it exits the body. It may cause inflammation and blockage. First aid for swallowed poison:

1. If the person is not breathing, start CPR. Use a barrier device so you don’t contaminate yourself with the poison.

2. Check the packaging of the poison, if possible, so that you know what it is.

3. Induce vomiting only if told to do so by the EMS dispatcher or the Poison Control Centre.

4. If the person needs to go to the hospital, bring a sample of the poison (or its original container).

**14. Snake bites**

**Myth: You can help slow the spread of venom through the body by cutting the wound or applying suction, ice, electricity, or a tourniquet.**

These measures are not effective in slowing the spread of venom. They are likely to cause pain and injury. First aid for snake bites is to seek medical attention as quickly as possible.

Call EMS and get an AED. If you are unsure whether a venomous snake caused the bite, call EMS anyway. Do not wait for life-threatening signs and symptoms of poisoning to appear.

Before providing care, ensure that the snake is no longer present. If you see the snake, remember what it looks like so that you can describe it to EMS personnel. This information will help them provide the most appropriate treatment. Never attempt to capture or handle a potentially venomous snake.

Keep the injured site still and level with the heart if possible.

If the bite is on a limb, remove jewelry or tight clothing from the limb and watch for swelling.

Wash the wound with water.

Cover the wounded area with a clean, dry dressing.

Don’t try to suck the venom out. The venom from the snake bite is shot into the bloodstream towards the heart and moves around the body. There is no way you could suck out all the venom. Instead, keep the bite below the level of the heart and try to stay calm as you contact the emergency medical services.

**15. Jellyfish stings**

**Myth: Peeing on a jellyfish sting helps ease the pain.**

Peeing on a jellyfish sting can do more harm than good. Urine only makes the jellyfish stinger release more venom, thus causing more pain for the patient.

For the first aid of jellyfish stings, call EMS and get an AED if the person is having airway or breathing problems, was stung on the face or neck, or does not know what caused the sting.

1. Get the person out of the water as soon as possible.

2. Flush the injured area with vinegar for at least 30 seconds to counteract the toxin. If vinegar is unavailable, mix baking soda and water into a paste and leave it on the area for 20 minutes.

3. While wearing gloves or using a towel, carefully remove any stingers, tentacles, or pieces of the animal.

4. Immerse the affected area in water as hot as the person can tolerate (no more than 45°C (113°F)) for at least 20 minutes or until the pain is relieved.

5. If hot water is unavailable, use dry hot packs or even dry cold packs to help decrease the pain. Remember to wrap the hot or cold packs in a thin, dry towel or cloth to protect the skin. Do not rub the area or apply a bandage.

If the person has been stung by a Portuguese man-of-war (a bluebottle jellyfish), flush the injured areas with ocean water instead of vinegar. Do not flush any jellyfish sting with fresh water, ammonia, or rubbing alcohol because these substances can increase the person’s pain.

**16. Tick bites**

Ticks are found in wooded, bushy areas, tall grass, and leaves on the ground. They can cause serious illnesses such as Lyme Disease.

**Myth: You can remove a tick safely by burning it off with a flame or smothering it with petroleum jelly or nail polish.**

More practical, safer, and quicker methods exist than these folk remedies.

If the tick hasn’t yet begun to dig into the flesh, remove it by brushing it off the skin.

If the tick has begun to bite, attempt to remove it in one piece as quickly as possible. The best tool for this is fine-tipped tweezers or a tick removal tool, such as a tick key. Use tweezers to grasp the tick by the head as close to the person’s skin as possible.

Pull upward slowly and steadily without twisting until the tick releases its hold. If you cannot remove the tick or its mouthparts stay in the skin, the person must seek medical attention.

Once you’ve removed the tick, wash the area with clean tap water. The running water’s pressure allows it to penetrate more deeply into the wound.

Save the tick in a resealable bag and record the date.

Advise the person to monitor the bite for several days for signs and symptoms of infection. The person should seek medical attention if they notice the area shows signs of infection, e.g., redness, warmth, and pain, or if they develop a fever.

**17. Getting sued for giving first aid**

**Myth: You could get sued if you perform CPR.**

For public safety, the law protects people taking reasonable actions to save someone’s life. If you stay with an injured person until help arrives and help them as best you can within the scope of your training, the law will protect you.

But what if the person dies?

If you started CPR and the person didn’t survive, know that you didn’t kill the person. If someone goes into cardiac arrest, the person is already dying. If no one starts CPR, their chances of surviving until EMS arrives are almost non-existent. Unless you know they have a signed do not resuscitate (DNR) order, the best thing you can do is start CPR.

**Conclusions and Takeaways**

There are many myths about first-aid treatment. The best way to become confident in your knowledge and skills is to take a first aid and CPR class from a well-recognized and respected organization like the Red Cross.

First aid and CPR training benefits everyone. It gives people the skills and confidence to act quickly and effectively in an emergency, giving sick or injured people the best chance of survival.

There is never a convenient time for an accident, injury, or sudden medical emergency. It’s essential to prepare and be ready to assist at any moment. There’s no better gift you can give a person than saving their life.

I am looking for a movie that has this scene:

There are several (younger/students) people who go into a diner and order food/coffee.
They are a mix of white and black people, i especially remember there being a black woman/girl.

The era of the movie is when there was still segregation or it had just ended. I think this movie is situated in the southeast of America.

The people in the diner are met with hatefull comments, one of the people (the black girl) is being spat on and at one point there is hot coffee being thrown in the face of them.
They are then thrown out of the diner.

I thought the movie was about the Savannah sit-in but that turns me to the movie Midnight in the garden of good and evil, and this is not the movie is am looking for.

Can someone help me find this?",1,1760033770.0,whatisthatmovie,1,1.0,False

ma’am, those bottles cost more than my rent.

the part that hurts is how calmly she said it.  
no shame. no panic. just “you’ll survive, honey.”  
meanwhile, i’m here surviving on instant noodles while she’s pairing merlot with regrets.

to be fair, she raised me, so maybe she’s just collecting emotional interest.

1o2dfnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1o2dfnv/thinking_of_leaving_my_job_need_opinions/,Thinking of leaving my job; need opinions.,"Hello!
I truly need some opinions and potentially advice on if I should stay at my current place or start looking elsewhere. 

About me: graduated with honors and have a bachelors degree - which I received last year. (Was an older student) Have 10+ years experience service/hospitality background. 

Moved to the west coast and started looking for work. NOTHING. 6 months of looking and I was finally taken part time in a sales position. Which I worked up to full time hire after 4 months. Was a brutal period for me. 
Regardless, I am over my expectation for their goals. I am currently at 150% to my target (over my target) and reached my first million $ in sales in just 4 months. Sooner than some of the seniors. I have great reviews and I work very hard. 

Pros: I make about 100k a year. So I finally feel like I can breathe. 

Cons: it’s brutal schedule. My manager believes in split days off. Refuses 2 days off in a row. Only 1 Saturday off a month. If you want to request 2 days off in a row or any vacation, prepare to work 7 days in a row. Multiple employees have brought it up with HR but they don’t do anything about it. I’m actually physically and mentally exhausted. Especially considering we take our work phones home and have to answer client calls off the clock. No additional pay. Sometimes we have to come in on our day off for a client or you lose a sale. I’ve been reprimanded for not answering client emails during my vacation on THE DAY of my cousins wedding where I was the bridesmaid. 

My schedule changes every week. But I’ll have Monday off and Thursday off. Sometimes. Monday off / Wednesday off. Or Tuesday / Saturday off. But never together. It’s her personal philosophy. 

We MUST have hair and makeup done and dry cleaned uniform. Nails done etc. I’m exhausted by the amount of perfection. I can do it, but again the schedule is killing me. 

Recently I’ve been in the middle of moving apartments to be able to walk to work. I’ve come in 5 min late a few times this week. But I never call out and I always come in or stay late if they need me to. 
My manager has reprimanded me about my hours and that I’ve been coming in late. 

I work either 9:30a - 6:30p OR 12:30-9pm 
Am I being a baby about this ? 
Do I have it good or am I gaslighting myself?

There is no growth in this job because it’s the only one in the area. I don’t want to wait for 2 years for management if someone finally retires. I don’t want to work this schedule for 2 years + either. I’m clearly good at my job and fantastic as sales and client experience. 

I’m concerned about the job market and leaving but also I need someone to tell me if this job is crazy situation?

I cannot have a life like this. I’m chronically exhausted. And I’ve been having heart palpitations from coffee and stress. My days off I’m glued to my work phone just in case. I can’t travel. I can’t stay up late. I’m too tired for date night or gym. I can’t make new friends as my schedule is different every week so I can’t join a club or meetup. I don’t feel like I have control over my own life. Not even my days off. Every evening feels like Sunday night. But I’m financially secure for the first time in my life and I can walk to work. 

I wanted to do my masters but I can’t with this schedule. So I’m saving money right now instead. Are there better options?
