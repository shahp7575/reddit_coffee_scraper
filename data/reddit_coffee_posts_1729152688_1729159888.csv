What makes these sneakers so special? For starters, the leather upper is not only sleek and stylish but also durable and easy to clean. The iconic Nike swoosh adds a touch of classic sportswear style, while the gum rubber sole provides excellent traction and a subtle pop of color. I've worn mine with everything from jeans and a t-shirt to chinos and a button-down, and they always look great.


One of the things I appreciate most about the Killshot 2 is its comfort. The cushioned insole and padded collar make these shoes perfect for all-day wear. Whether I'm running errands, meeting friends for coffee, or even attending casual work events, my feet stay comfortable and supported.


The versatility of these sneakers is truly unmatched. The ""Black/Gum"" colorway is particularly striking, offering a more sophisticated look than your average athletic shoe. It's this perfect balance of casual and refined that makes the Killshot 2 such a standout in my wardrobe.


I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to add another pair to my collection at such a great price.

The Nike Killshot 2 Leather has definitely enhanced my personal style, and I believe it could do the same for you.

Stopped by a coffee shop and was introduced to extract chilling. Quickly updated myself online. The espresso I was given had a giant extraction ball IN the cup. I immediately knew it was going to be weird because the giant ball was as large as or essentially filled the entire cup. As a whisky drinker I understand the whisky rocks fad. The science of cooling/freezing the portafilter/ cup or pouring OVER the extraction ball is also easily understood. But drinking from a cup with a ball so giant your lips are touching the ball the entire time you sip your espresso was hilarious / unpleasant to me in form and function.

Now (abt 2,5months) i have the anhedonia still and no motivation but hit the gym close to everyday which somehow fixes my mood temporarily. Currently im experiencing mad intrusive thoughts abt everything in a really bad way and im constantly angry about minor things that wouldnt even bother me before that.I can get a rage outburst for no reason to the wrong people for something really minor or stupid.This is my experience till now i hope to get the sooner the possible healthy and mentally stable.

I (25F) work as a manager for a small business, and I have for a few years since it opened. The owner (30M - *who I will call ""Mark"")* works out front with all of us on a daily basis. We have some real turnover like any service industry business, so I am the only one who is still here from us first opening, but we do have a couple people who have been here since the first year we were in business. I am one of the two managers on staff *(we don't work different times we just cover different areas/portions of the staff)* and the other manger (40's?M *- let's call him ""Pete"")* and I have very different but complimentary management styles.

I used to manage Pete's people/dept until we hired him in as we grew as a business, so when him and I have our brief meetings to keep our teams working well together we run ideas/problems by each other in case the other person has run into that thing before and has a solution *(he also brings previous manager experience to the table)*. **Today we had a meeting like this and something he said prompted me to begin writing this post again, not just because of what he said, but also how he said it.**

# For context;

Our boss Mark is a tricky guy, he is very charming, fit, and handsome in a conventional way, and very good at small talk and the like with customers and staff, like a good personable salesman promoting his business, but the staff overall see him as a quiet and mysterious person. My husband ""Connor"" (27M) who has come in at times and met Mark says the same thing, they all say ""he is a quiet guy"". This has not been my experience, as he can really talk if you get to know him, and my husband has brought up multiple times that Mark seems to ignore/avoid him when he visits the shop, which admittedly Mark does seem to almost avoid him. Before working here I have never worked for a business this small, so I have no reference for how working directly with an owner should work or how friendly you're supposed to get over the years, but I would say we are friends, and he seems very intentional with setting certain boundaries, but not others.

This apparently does not seem to be the consensus for those of us with real tenure here, and the others have made that clear to me. Below are a list of things Pete and the staff have said to me privately all on separate occasions, the last one being what Pete said in our meeting today:

>""we're all replaceable, he'd never let go of you""

>""you're just saying that cause you're his favorite""

>""You're like our Work Mommy and Work Daddy""

>""you ask him, you're the favorite""

>""he'd do whatever you ask him to""

>""we get on each other's nerves sometimes but I could never p\*ss you off for real or Mark would get rid of me""

>""you're his favorite and you know it""

>""Whenever I start my own chain Mark and I made a deal for me to take *(xyz staff members)*, but he wouldn't even joke about making a deal for you. He just ignored me asking. Seriously. I'm serious""

>""we all know you're his favorite""

>""we both agreed you're the favorite""

>""Jake and I are cool with him, but he only likes you. He only LIKES you""

# The situation that brought that last one up was budgetary, and happened today.

Pete wanted to buy something to make part of his job a little easier, not better, basically convenience related as Pete manages the cleaners and budgets their supplies. In the past Pete has previously asked me *\*very\** nicely and not so sneakily to ask Mark to buy something for the front, and when I did, he bought it immediately. This has actually happened a few times. I asked Pete why he doesn't just ask Mark himself to buy this new thing and Pete said ""no, I already asked him, a couple times. He says it's not a need right now. Why can't you ask him? he'll say yes to you. You're his favorite"".

I honestly have run out of nervous excuses/responses at this point so all I could rebut with was ""I can't help that"", and told him again to ask Mark.

Pete said ""No, he won't buy stuff if the rest of us ask. Jake and I are cool with him but he only likes you. He only LIKES you,"" then Pete looked me up and down not subtly at all and that was the end of our meeting.

# Separate from comments made by staff here are some aspects of our overall dynamic that have over time lead to me seriously questioning things with Mark;

* **Without a doubt** **I am the favorite**. I can't really deny it or explain it, he just favors me. I always assumed because we are such similar people, but he is excellent at relating to people. Maybe I just don't feel like the type to be a favorite.
* **He** **has shared a lot with me**, about himself, his life, his thoughts, his dreams, his plans, his crazy ideas. Definitely not everything, but he speaks very directly and openly with me, and I feel genuinely listened to, as he asks my input on things for the business and when we brainstorm together.
* **He is very playful with me**. For as macho as he is with the male staff, and as professional as he can get with customers and friends/family that visits, he is generally playful with me, especially when he is in a good mood. Due to this, Pete and the staff generally use me as a meter/detector for his mood, even asking me outright ""how's his mood today?"".
* **Everything he does is on purpose**. He says this when he boasts how smart/tactile he is with marketing or socializing, and he seems to mean it. He really thinks things through, choosing to act or not act very carefully. I cannot imagine this man stumbling into a trap or situation of any kind on accident, but maybe I overestimate him.
* **The eye contact**. This man is intimidating and does not shy from eye contact when meeting customers/in general conversation, but boy does he hardly blink when we talk. The several times I have straight up gotten bashful, blushed, and told him outright that his stare is hard to beat, he just gives me that smug smile and keeps staring, even blushing himself.
* **He flexes during conversation**. You know the whole *\*he put his hands behind his head, elbows up, and his biceps showed\**. Well, sitting, standing, short or long conversation, even just upon me entering the room, he puts his hands back and flashes his arm muscles. I assumed this was him showing he is relaxed or maybe a nervous fidget, until his body language in a certain group conversation a few months ago caught my attention, after which I noticed he does it every time we talk.
* **He** **vents to me about staff**, even about Pete. I will admit we mutually participate in this. However, while Pete and the staff privately bring their issues straight to me for advice/resolution/to be heard/rat on each other, they have never mentioned Mark even criticizing me, only bragging about me. Maybe they are sparing my feelings?
* **I get his full attention** unless someone bursts into his little office, he will even ignore his wife's calls seemingly in annoyance unless he is expecting her call. A couple times he has taken her call in one of our talks and rolled his eyes to me while listening to her talk.
* **He shares personal stories**/details with everyone when trying to motivate/relate, but sometimes with me he gets into his issues/annoyances with his wife *(especially if I mention ""dealing with something"" with Connor)*. His wife seems oddly similar to my husband Connor in personality, and Mark and I are oddly similar. Maybe we're just bonding over those similarities?
* **He volunteers help seemingly for no reason**. He has many times told me how capable I am and that I don't need help, even coming to me for help himself. He is completely willing to step in if one of the new staff gets caught off guard by a rough situation with a customer, this being said... he messages me offering to help when I don't need it. Back in the earlier days of the business he used to assist me like he does with the new guys, taking over the conversation with a ""challenging"" customer, and he really seemed to enjoy standing in my space for 10-20 minutes taking charge while I smile and nod. I honestly think he misses this.
* **He notices my mood**, and speaks to me more softly/carefully when I am in a mood or upset. If a customer gets into it with Pete, he tells Pete to get over it. When a customer gets into it with me, he gets irritated. Jake (23M) has mentioned this saying ""he only cares when people try to yell at you. Maybe I should just hide behind you next time"".
* **He peeks.** He doesn't ogle, BUT, I have seen him peeking, usually in a small group when someone else is speaking with their attention on me and he thinks no one is looking. I'll be honest, I try to avoid him noticing my noticing, but knowing Mark he 100% knows a sneakier way to peek. I can't blame him though, sometimes your eye just gets caught and you have to correct yourself mid-peek.
* **He asks for little tiny favors** ""like the old days"". This may be a nostalgia or a power thing, but he often will ask for teeny tiny favors like me calling someone back for him, or fetching his coffee, hand deliver something for him, file something for him etc and he gives me that smug look when I say yes, especially if my stubborn self at first said that I wouldn't or hesitated.
* **Our meetings go overtime.** Something that was supposed to be a short chat can turn into a long and involved conversation. One time in particular he said ""I just need 10 minutes"" and we ended up in his little office for almost two hours. Sometimes when he has 5-30 minutes to kill he will just find me and initiate the chatting. He kills time with all of us throughout the work day absolutely, but he will ""waste"" long periods of work talking with me about anything at all, whereas his conversations with staff seem to mostly be on the same few subjects.
* **He will ask for help on things he knows how to do**. Not in the way Jake does and prior staff have done to avoid using their own brain. After he gets my help with the small thing he will ""oh yeah, also"" which is his segway into sharing a conversation with me and chatting about little things that don't matter, day-to-day chit-chat.
* **The Chemistry.** We know each other very well and can predict each other's behavior quite accurately. When the staff and Pete are betting what Mark or I will do in xyz situation that's on its way, we will bet too and we never lose. He also seems to see my odd behaviors as endearing when I the staff thinks I'm just weird.
* **He doesn't seem to like my husband**. Not that he has it out for him or anything, he just seems almost indifferent to him when he stops by. He has also been quite critical of him to me. When talking about my weekend/my day/an event with Connor, Mark with ask critical questions, has gotten annoyed with how Connor takes care of me ""or lack there of"" at times, and once he made me really defensive and insecure about Connor's ability to provide due to something specific that Connor did, and after that conversation Mark backed off the rest of the day.
* **His wife (32F) seems indifferent to me.** She is so sweet and soft voiced and is an adorable little lady overall, everyone loves her. She asks people about themselves and socializes well, but in front of Mark and myself her tone is deeper, she is less angelic unless she wants something, and she usually seems annoyed. She acts very familiar with me but doesn't ask me questions and usually talks to anyone but me, except one time when she made a point to ask me how Mark's mood was that day, and leaned in eager to hear me answer. Mark entered the room at that point and she shrugged and pretended she didn't ask anything. She is friendlier to me when Connor is around, but things get awkward when it's me, her, and Mark in a room.
* **The tension in the silence.** When the two of us are talking alone, sometimes there is the very brief silence where we're looking at each other, and you can feel what is like static electricity in the air. It's a brief moment, but it is visible when we try to get the conversation back to business or even just get the talking started again.
* **He notices me**. Normally when I meet eyes with people I can get stuck in their attention for a second, and they ask ""what?"" or ""do you need something?"" but often he holds my attention without expecting me to talk. He just stares back like we're two deer in headlights.
* **Mimicking body language**. In groups or with just the two of us I've noticed us copying each other's posture or fidgeting. I assumed this was because we know each other better than we know the others, but it happens more than sometimes. I started testing it by changing my poster/pose to see if he follows, and he does.
* **The little smile.** As I mentioned with my ""endearing"" characteristics, when these happen, when I am being silly, or say something possibly ridiculous, he has this little smile, where he looks down and smiles to himself, especially when one of the staff comments on my behavior and shakes their head at me.
* **The jealousy aimed his way.** As I mentioned earlier, one of our front staff Jake is a bit of a scoundrel and despite me being married he ended up catching some feelings when he was starting, and other staff noticed. I had a ""talk"" with Jake about this, in that way where he wouldn't say it out loud but instead walked on eggshells around certain words, saying that ""out of respect for me he will respect my commitment to Connor and not pursue anything"" then also stating ""not that he has anything to do with it... a husband never stopped me before... I'm not intimidated"". Anyways- he seems to have moved on, but is still attached to me in a way that is usually easy to ignore. Jake has begrudgingly let me know, very bluntly, several times, that he'll ""never be able to take me from Mark"" because ""Mark would never let me go"" and Jake seems to resent this.
* **He refuses to speak on my appearance in front of others**, but has privately showed annoyance when I voice insecure thoughts about my appearance, telling me to stop and correcting me. I have been very careful about not bluntly saying that he is handsome *(unlike the staff and even customers)*, and he seems to have the same hesitation regarding commenting on my appearance.
* **The gut feeling.** We are attached to and fond of each other for sure, but trying to figure out where exactly the line is has been racking my brain. He can be so political, and would never leave written or recorded evidence of an incriminating act or quote of his. If you showed him this post he would have an excuse for each word and every bullet point and be able to talk his way out of it somehow like he has no idea what you're talking about. He's too smart to get caught. He has been certain to leave certain boundaries in place, but ignores some others with seemingly no regard.

# The last time I got an odd feeling like this was years ago

when a supposed ""friend"" *(""Tom"")* was ""keeping me as a backup plan""/""experimental option"", all the while gaslighting me and some people close to me *(including my brothers who he was friends with)* into thinking I made it all up, mixed signals and everything. Very recently I met with an old friend and we discussed Tom as I previously thought I had been imagining his interest in me, and it turns out this friend revealed that I was spot on according to Tom's own words, and that Tom was actually expressing interest in me to his friends throughout the course of several girlfriends, and had quote ""an unhealthy obsession with me"". I always wondered why his gf *(now wife)* didn't seem to like me, and now I have been informed that it is because Tom made up a bunch of lies about me being obsessed with him to hide his behavior and interest from her.

Hearing the old friend's side of things made me reconsider a lot in my current situation, and as I have been telling myself these past years that - ""no me, you're just crazy, you're not worth the trouble, there's no way this kind of thing would happen to you, you're not good looking or funny enough or nice enough"" etc. etc.

Now I question if I have been asking the wrong questions this whole time, so I am changing my approach.

# My husband

is a very sensitive person, when I bring issues to him it takes a LONG conversation and lots of reassuring for us to get through the other side in okay spirits. I have tried to bring up this issue to him in the past to get advice on what to do, but he gives me very vague answers and tells me he doesn't want to know details, then gets noticeably down in mood for days at a time. My instinct is to bring him into this to find a solution together, but I fear that his current insecurity and worry about me losing interest in him *(which he has had since day one)* would only be exaggerated by me walking him through everything I just wrote out here.

I am not usually one to say ""leave him out of it and deal with it yourself"", I am usually the ""tell the full sharp bloody truth"" type of person, but I'm starting to think that I am wrong and the solution lies in handling this myself.

# The conclusion:

I am trying to grow, and realize I may have been entertaining/enabling Mark's behavior and not doing my best to set boundaries with him, especially at difficult times in my marriage when I have yearned to be understood and comforted.

On my end I have decided I may need to speak with a professional, even though I don't know how to begin looking into who to talk to about that or how to find a therapist, and that could take months for all I know. In the meantime...

Are we madly in love? No way.

Do I think we've crossed some boundaries and I need to learn how to set those better? Absolutely, that's why I'm here typing this.

Do I think our spouses would be in good spirits with all of this information? F\*ck no, I don't know if they'd be more sad or p\*ssed.

I love this job, but where do I go from here without outright quitting? And am I blowing this out of proportion?

# What do you think:

1. Do you think this is a mutual thing we entertained for fun without realizing neither of us is smart enough to choose a point to stop?
2. Am I mistaking a friend's kindness for something else?
3. Was Mark trying to dance a manipulative line keeping me loyal to his business, and fell into this by accident?
4. Do you recognize this situation as something else entirely?

# TLDR; My boss and I both have spouses but we have gotten too attached to each other. Where do I go from here without quitting my dream job or my husband finding out?",1,1729159027.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

I don’t usually go to that part of town, but I happened to see a girl I liked. At first, I thought she was a waitress, but I later found out she’s a relative of the owner and was just helping out that day.

I was totally captivated by her and tried to flirt a bit. She took the compliments well and even complimented me back. The conversation ended, and I left, but I wasn’t feeling my best since I had just been discharged from an operation that day.

In the following days, I went back to the café a few times but didn’t see her again. So, I sent her an Instagram follow request and messaged her, saying I liked her and asked if we could grab a coffee. She didn’t accept or reject my request but said maybe we’d run into each other again at the café. I agreed and went there two days later, and she was there. She was really nice but super busy, so after waiting for about an hour, I left. Before leaving, I told her I’d love to offer her a coffee, and she said, ‘I definitely want to as well, but I’ve been really busy lately. I’ll message you.’ It’s been five days, and I haven’t heard from her yet, and she still hasn’t accepted my follow request on Instagram. So, I’m wondering: Is there still hope, or has she indirectly turned me down?""

[all]","Annabeth closed the trunk on the Baby blue sedan, then looked at me. “All packed, Kelp head”. Her blond hair wisped away across her face in the slight wind. We were finally ready to head back to Manhattan, in time to have a final check in for the plans Jason had for Camp Half Blood. We would also be meeting Grover there, which would be great. Also enough time to check in with my mum and my little sister. I knew she didn't like me being far away, even after calling often. I just wished- “Percy? You ok?” Annabeth read my face like a book. Her face turned into one of sympathy. “We’ll see them soon ok?” I nod, then grin. “It's going to be awesome!” I drove first, and finally we arrived in Manhattan. As we are cruising on the streets, I take a second to look aside at Annabeth’s sleepy face. She’s been by my side more times than I can count, and always had a plan. Now that we have been finally getting a moment to hang around new Rome together, I've started to think that I could never get a better partner in battle, and outside of it. Except for maybe Grover. My deep train of thought was interrupted by the sound of beeping. I pulled abruptly to a stop, just before hitting an old lady at the crossing. Annabeth was pulled awake, then gave me a menacing stare. “Watch the road, Percy.” then imitating the voice of my old mentor Chiron she said. “We don't want any more accidents, you’ve already lost too many licences.” We both laughed at the joke, but then I felt a pang of nostalgia, remembering the good old days. I sighed,  then I stared out the window. I loved the Good Ol Manhattan streets, the couples sitting in cafes, the bizarre and sometimes funny situations outside, the empousa playing checkers on a table-”umm. Are those empousa or did I have too much coffee?” I see annabeths eyes go wide, then she tells me to keep driving. “What about the mortals?” I ask. “The mist, percy.” “oh” I say. Weird that I forgot. We keep driving, and finally make it through to the upper east. My mums house is still the same small one that I left almost a year ago. It seems weird to not have actually seen my mum since. We pull up on the street, and I knock on the door. I'm actually quite nervous about not seeing my mum for so long. Annabeth's hand slips into mine, as the door clicks open. I can imagine what this would look like on a movie. “And percy’s mum enters the scene, lights camera action! aaaaaaannnndddddd???”

 “Percy!” she exclaims, and suddenly there's a lot more mum and a little less percy. I get attacked by a hug, then she sees Annabeth and hugs her instead. “You must come in!” she tells us, then leads us in. “pauls at work, so it's just me, but if you stay the night i'm sure you’ll see him!” i suddenly feel a little ashamed, and both me and annabeth seem to blush a little, and mum reads our faces and her face breaks, and i finally get a proper look at her. She seems the same, except for a bit more grey in her dark hair, but she has bags on her eyes, and looks exhausted. For a moment she reminds me of luke's mum, which sends a thrill of fear in me, but no green eyes or excessive peanut butter sandwiches. “I'm sorry mum” I stutter out, but she still looks really sad, until her face cements into something fake. “It's ok percy, you probably haven't seen any of your friends for a while, so you can go as soon as you want.” She sounds so expertly good at this, and I feel guilty as I wonder how many times she has had to pull this wall to shield me from what she really felt. We sit down on the table, and Mum brings out cookies. This woman always has cookies, does she have a secret cookie basement? I’ve never thought of asking. “-Weren’t we Percy?” I can hear Annabeth say. I snap back to reality and say yes, because Annabeth usually agrees with me agreeing with her. My mum then says “Oh well, lucky i kept the altar in Percy’s room. I was wondering whether to make an indoor garden with that.” “Well lucky you kept it?” i say. “You never know when I will appear!” I meant to say it as a joke, but I can see the sadness weighing down on my mum's posture. I get a pinch from Annabeth. “Well, here you go, don’t be too long” I wasn’t sure about it before but my mums voice definitely cracked there. She raced off and left us behind. Annabeth glares at me, then when I shrugged, she seemed to glare even harder. I'm glad I wasn't turned into a pool of percy sludge. “Don’t you see?” she hissed. “You're being so careless with your comments, it's like you don't care about her at all!” “Woah,” I said. “That's a little too far.” “Ha” she says, being thoroughly bitter. “Just message grover and well go”. I was so confused, I made the dumbest mistake ever and said “Ok, if that's what you want”. Then I walked over to the altar where I had my mist sprayer, and got a drachma, then said, “O Iris, goddess of rainbows, show me Grover underwood, wherever he may be”.

The only drinks that don't mess with me are pre made shakes but for the life of me I can't figure out why. I tried a Starbucks protein latte today, expecting the worst because it's coffee based, but ive been fine. However I do not want to be paying 3 quid a pop for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

All I can think of at this point is that maybe the way I prepare the shakes? I use a shaker and is that introducing bubbles? Is that an issue. Does anyone have any advice? ",2,1729158321.0,GastricBypass,0,1.0,False

1g5mzvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Lapost25/comments/1g5mzvh/explore_ojais_natural_beauty_and_smalltown_charm/,"Explore Ojai's natural beauty and small-town charm
","Tucked away in the Topatopa Mountains, a mere hour and a half from the sprawling concrete jungle of Los Angeles, Ojai beckons as a tranquil haven. This quaint Californian town has long been whispered about in certain circles as a spiritual sanctuary, a place where the frenetic pace of modern life seems to slow to a gentle amble. In this picturesque valley, weekenders find solace from the urban grind, trading traffic jams for [hiking](https://www.lapost.com/dog-who-survived-72-days-in-mountains-after-owners-death-is-regaining-weight-back-on-hiking-trails/) trails and corporate boardrooms for sun-dappled orchards.

Ojai's allure is multifaceted, drawing in a diverse crowd of nature enthusiasts, wellness seekers, and city dwellers desperate for a breath of fresh air. The town's natural beauty serves as its primary attraction, with the surrounding mountains offering a playground for hikers and bikers alike. The Ojai Valley Trail stands out as a local favorite, a verdant path that meanders from the heart of town all the way to the coastal breezes of Ventura. It's not uncommon to see families pedaling along, their laughter mingling with the rustle of leaves overhead.

For those with a more adventurous spirit, the [Los Padres National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/lpnf) looms large on the horizon, its network of trails promising everything from leisurely strolls to challenging backcountry expeditions. The Valley View Preserve, perched in the rugged foothills, offers hikers a rewarding vista of the Ojai Valley spread out below like a patchwork quilt of greens and golds. It's a view that has inspired artists and dreamers for generations, capturing the essence of this magical place in a single sweeping panorama.

Despite its inland location, Ojai's water enthusiasts aren't left high and dry. Lake Casitas, a short drive from downtown, is a boating, fishing, and lazy lakeside picnics hub. While swimming in the lake is off-limits, families flock to the adjacent water park, where the squeals of children careening down water slides punctuate the air on warm summer days. It's a different kind of California water experience, far removed from the surf and sand of the coast, yet no less refreshing.

Perhaps the most iconic of Ojai's natural wonders are the [Santa Paula Punch Bowls](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/santa-paula-canyon-to-first-falls). These natural swimming holes, fed by a cascading 25-foot waterfall, have become something of a pilgrimage site for those in the know. The journey there isn't for the faint of heart - a 7.4-mile round-trip hike that challenges even seasoned trekkers. But those who persevere are rewarded with crystal-clear pools, perfect for a cooling dip on a scorching day. It's nature's own infinity pool, with a view that no luxury resort could hope to match.

Beyond its outdoor offerings, Ojai's downtown area is a testament to its commitment to preserving its unique character. Ojai has banned chain stores from its main streets in a bold move against the tide of homogenization sweeping across America. The result is a charming collection of independent boutiques, art galleries, and cafes, each with its own distinct personality. Browsing these shops feels like a treasure hunt, with handcrafted jewelry, locally produced artwork, and artisanal foods waiting to be discovered around every corner.

No exploration of Ojai's downtown would be complete without a visit to Bart's Books. This bibliophile's paradise, proudly claiming the title of the world's largest outdoor bookstore, has been a local institution since 1964. Wandering through its maze-like aisles, with over 13,000 books basking in the California sunshine, is an experience that kindles the imagination and stirs the soul. It's not uncommon to see visitors lost in literary reverie, perched on a bench with a dusty tome in hand, completely oblivious to the passage of time.

Ojai's reputation as a wellness destination is well-earned, with an array of spas and retreat centers catering to those seeking inner peace and outer pampering. From the luxurious treatments at Spa Ojai to the more down-to-earth offerings of The Day Spa of Ojai, there's no shortage of options for those looking to unwind. For those inclined towards the spiritual, Meditation Mount offers guided sessions against a backdrop of breathtaking vistas. Whether you believe in Ojai's reputed energy vortexes or not, there's no denying the sense of calm that descends upon visitors as they breathe in the sage-scented air.

The culinary scene in Ojai is a reflection of the town's ethos - locally sourced, lovingly prepared, and served with a side of laid-back charm. Mornings might start at The Dutchess, where the aroma of freshly baked pastries mingles with the rich scent of locally roasted coffee. Lunch could find you at Pinyon, a newcomer that's quickly become a local favorite with its artisanal pizzas and creative sandwiches. As the day winds down, Rory's Place beckons with its farm-to-table offerings, where the McAuliffe sisters craft dishes that sing of the Ojai Valley's bounty.

A visit to Ojai would only be complete with sampling the local libations. The tasting room of Topa Topa Brewing Company offers a perfect perch to watch the sun dip behind the mountains, painting the sky in hues that give rise to Ojai's famed ""pink moment."" Wine enthusiasts can explore the offerings of The Ojai Vineyard, where each sip tells a story of the valley's terroir.

When laying your head down for the night, Ojai offers options to suit every taste. The Ojai Rancho Inn balances retro cool and modern comfort, its poolside hammocks inviting guests to spend hours away with a good book. For those who prefer to sleep under the stars, Dennison Park provides campsites with panoramic views of the valley below. There's something magical about watching the last light of day paint the Topatopa Bluffs in shades of pink and purple, a nightly show that never fails to captivate.

As weekenders reluctantly pack their bags and point their cars back towards the city, they carry with them more than just souvenirs. They take a piece of Ojai's tranquility, a mental snapshot of sun-drenched hills and star-filled skies. It's a reminder that sometimes, the greatest luxury is simplicity, and the most profound adventures are those that lead us back to ourselves. In Ojai, the spiritual and the natural intertwine, creating a tapestry of experiences that lingers long after the journey home.

As a filter coffee, it’s interestingly not very acidic while maintaining the strong pineapple/lime aroma. I would expect this level of fruitiness in a co-ferment or something, but given that this is honey is very impressive.

Being a honey process and being roasted lightly also makes it easy to drink. I’m very happy I bought it despite it being a little expensive (¥3000/113g).",3,1729157522.0,coffeejp,0,1.0,False

I wake up again after only 3 hours of sleep. The hotel room is already super hot, even though it’s still early in the morning. I take the chance to have another cold shower before setting off. I stop by the hotel owner’s restaurant to thank him for the pizza from last night. After a quick espresso, I’m back on the road.

Now because I’m outside the EU, I activate the e-sim on my phone, something I’ve never tried before. To my surprise, the mobile data works perfectly. During the planning phase, I spent a lot of time worrying about internet access, knowing that a good connection is very important during the race. Because we cross multiple borders, buying a new SIM card every time just wasn’t an option. Luckily, it all seems to be working smoothly.

I ride to the first supermarket of the day and have 3 ice creams for breakfast. The supermarkets in the Balkans are getting smaller and smaller as I go. Most of them are just small roadside shops or kiosks, stocked with soft drinks, ice cream, coffee, gummy bears, and 7Days croissants. I remember this from my last trip when I cycled from Athens to Regensburg. It’s actually perfect for bikepacking and ultra racing - you can get plenty of carbs quickly, keep an eye on your bike because it’s always in view, and avoid wasting time standing in long checkout lines.

Today’s goal is to make it to the start of parcours 2. If that works out, I can ride the toughest section of the race tomorrow. I pass through Banja Luka quickly and stop to buy a third spare tube in preparation for parcours 2. My planning tells me there will be a lot of gravel and no opportunity for mechanical support. You have to carry everything you need with you, or you’re out of the race. Not long after Banja Luka, Victor overtakes me. I already know he’s got 500 more kilometers in his legs than I do because he accidentally left his wallet behind and had to cross the Alps three times in total. What a huge mental and physical effort!

Meanwhile, I’m not feeling great today. I’m losing power on the pedals, even though I’ve eaten and stayed hydrated. Maybe it’s a lack of minerals because of the heat, or just exhaustion from poor sleep over the last few days? In addition, the knee pain is bad again today. I quickly calculate my arrival time for today, and once again, I’ll be arriving late into the night. This has been a big problem since day one, all because I didn’t ride through the first night. From this perspective, that was a major rookie mistake.

Today, the chances of finding a hotel look bad once more. So, I make a tough decision - I check into a hotel at 21:00 pm after only 160 kilometers, hoping to reset my sleep rhythm. This way, I can start early tomorrow and aim for a hotel by early evening. I’ve been putting this off for days, but it’s the only logical move before tomorrow’s tough stage.

1g5mvw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1g5mvw3/the_better_me/,The Better Me,"I wake up to the sound of rain tapping against the windows of the studio apartment in Portland I share with my wife Amber. Where everything smells faintly of coffee grounds and mildew. A sour tang lingers in the air—a scent I can’t place but makes my stomach turn.

My phone lies dead next to me on the nightstand. Strange. I could've sworn I plugged in the charger last night. I sit up, rubbing the sleep from my eyes, and the ache in my muscles feels deeper than it should, like I’ve been lying in the same position for days. My clothes—yesterday’s clothes—cling to my skin with the stale odor of sweat, as if I’ve lived in them far too long.

The clock reads 10:42 AM.

I never sleep in this late on a weekday.

A cold sense of dread creeps in as I stagger out of bed. My car keys aren’t on the hook by the door. My laptop is missing from the desk.

I shuffle toward the kitchen, each step heavy, like my body’s forgotten how to move. As I round the corner, our dog, Baxter, stands in the middle of the room—stiff, tail low, hackles raised. His lips peel back, exposing teeth in a way I've never seen before.

“Bax? Hey, buddy…” My voice cracks.

He growls, low and guttural, like I’m someone he’s never met. His eyes—usually soft and eager—are wild now, tracking my every movement, a predator sizing me up.

“Come on, it’s me.” I take a cautious step forward, but he lunges, snapping the air just inches from my hand. I stumble back, heart hammering.

The worst part isn’t the aggression—it’s the look in his eyes. There’s no recognition. None.

I barely manage to sidestep as Baxter snaps again, teeth clicking shut with a sharp *clack*. My heart races, and I grab the doorknob with trembling hands, wrenching it open just in time. I stumble out into the hallway, slamming the door behind me as his paws scrape furiously against the wood.

When I get to the curb outside, my car is gone.

Panic hums under my skin as I jog through the wet streets toward my office building downtown. The rain clings to me like a second skin, but I barely feel it. My pulse hammers in my ears. Something’s wrong. Everything’s wrong.

At the office entrance, I swipe my badge. The little beep sounds, but the turnstile won’t budge. I try again, but nothing happens.

The security guard at the front desk eyes me. “Can I help you?” he asks, polite but wary.

“Yeah, I—” I clear my throat. “I work here. Daniel Clarke. Marketing.”

The guard frowns and types something into his computer. He squints at the screen, then back at me. “Says here Daniel Clarke already checked in. About thirty minutes ago.”

The room tilts. My heart skips a beat. “What?”

The guard looks concerned.

“Look, man,” he says carefully, like he’s trying not to spook me. “You okay? You want me to call someone?”

I push past him before he can finish. “I need to get upstairs.”

He calls out after me, but I’m already in the elevator, jabbing the button for the eleventh floor. Each second that ticks by feels like a countdown to something inevitable and awful. The door opens with a chime, and I step into the familiar buzz of the open-concept office. Phones ringing. Keyboards clacking.

And then I see him.

He’s sitting at **my desk**, typing away with an easy, practiced smile. He glances up casually, and for a second, my brain short-circuits. Because the man in my chair—the one joking with Jason from accounting, drinking from my coffee mug, and wearing my watch—**is me.**

No. Not exactly. He’s… better. His jawline is sharper, his skin is clearer, his clothes fit perfectly—not rumpled or wrinkled like mine. Even his hair, always a little limp no matter what I do, is thick and swept back like he just walked off a photoshoot. He’s me without the flaws.

Jason claps him on the shoulder with a grin. “Congrats again, man! That promotion’s long overdue.”

My stomach twists. **The promotion. My promotion.** The one I’d been grinding for—sacrificing weekends, working overtime, skipping dinners with Amber—just to prove I was good enough.

“Thanks, bro,” The imposter’s voice is smooth and warm—like mine, but without the hesitation, the doubt.

I step forward, my voice trembling with anger. “Hey! Get the fuck out of my chair.”

The room falls silent. Heads turn. Every eye in the office locks on me, and for a moment, nobody moves. Jason shifts uncomfortably. A few coworkers whisper to each other, casting uneasy glances in my direction.

The other me tilts his head and smiles—cool, calm, and collected. “Sorry… Do I know you?”

Something snaps inside me. I slam my hands down on the desk. “I **am** Daniel Clarke! That’s my desk, you fucking fraud!”

Jason steps in front of him, his expression tight with confusion—and just a little bit of fear. “Hey, buddy,” he says, his tone low and careful. “I don’t know who you are but you need to leave. Right now. Before we call security.”

I open my mouth to protest, but two guards are already behind me, hands clamping around my arms.

The pity on everyone’s faces as they watch me being hauled away burns like acid in my chest.

They drag me out, toss me into the cold rain, and slam the door shut behind me. I sit there for a moment on the slick pavement, stunned, the rain washing over me. People pass by without a glance—just another nobody on the street.

I dig through my pockets, fingers trembling, and pull out my wallet. My driver’s license is gone—replaced by a blank, plastic card. No name. No photo. No address. Just empty space where I used to exist.

I don’t go straight home.

For the next two hours, I wander the streets in the rain, my coat soaked through, searching for answers. I call my cell service provider from a payphone, but my number has already been transferred to a new device. My bank? Same story. A new password was set this morning, and they won’t tell me more without “proper ID.”

I try calling Amber. No answer. I dial twice more—straight to voicemail.

At first, I think I’ve been hacked. But nothing fits. **How did they get my face? My voice? My fucking memories?**

I head to the police station next, but as soon as I tell them someone’s stolen my life—and that person looks and sounds exactly like me—the officer at the desk gives me this look. **Like I’m unstable. Like I’m a problem.**

\_\_\_\_

When I finally circle back home, the door to the apartment won’t budge. My key isn’t on me, and the doormat where we keep a spare is empty. I bang on the door, calling for Amber, but she doesn’t answer.

I circle the building, drenched, heart racing. The fire escape on the side—our usual shortcut when we forget our keys—is still there. One of the windows is cracked open, just enough to squeeze through. I haul myself up, the metal ladder groaning under my weight. My wet clothes stick to the rust, but I don't care. I just need to get inside. I need to see Amber. She’ll know what’s going on. She *has* to.

I slide the window up and pull myself in, landing awkwardly on the hardwood.

As I reach the hallway leading to the bedroom, I hear it—a low, rhythmic groan. My pulse stutters. I creep forward, trying not to make a sound. The door to our bedroom is ajar, light spilling from the crack. I push it open with trembling fingers.

I know what I’m going to find before I see it.

The bedroom smells of sweat and exertion, a scent so thick I gag on it. My wife, Amber, lies sprawled across the bed, glowing with satisfaction. Her dark hair is a wild tangle against the pillows, and she’s breathing in short, happy gasps—the kind I haven’t heard from her in a long time.

At the foot of the bed, **he** kneels between her legs. My face. My body. My voice, murmuring something low and soft. He wipes his mouth, still hard, and grins when he sees me standing in the doorway. **He doesn’t even bother covering himself.**

Amber lets out a dazed, satisfied laugh. “Oh my God, Dan… That was… you’ve never done that before.” She shivers, her skin flushed and glowing. “What got into you?”

I step forward, trembling. “Amber…”

Her head snaps toward me, and the joy drains from her face, replaced by confusion—then fear. She pulls the sheet over her body like I’m a stranger who just broke in.

“Who the fuck are you?” she whispers, her voice sharp with panic.

My throat tightens. “It’s me… It’s Daniel! I’m your husband!”

Her eyes dart to the other me—the perfect me, the **better** me—and I see the moment her confusion dissolves into certainty. She presses herself closer to him, trembling. “Dan, call the police!”

He gets off the bed slowly, lazily, like he has all the time in the world. “It’s okay, babe,” he murmurs, brushing her hair from her face. “He’s just confused.” He turns to me, still smiling that infuriating, perfect smile. “But you need to leave now. This isn’t your life anymore.”

I stagger backward, heart hammering, the walls closing in around me. “No. No, you’re the fake. You’re the fucking fake!”

Amber sobs, burying her face in his chest. He wraps his arms around her, comforting her, **owning her**, and something inside me crumbles. She clings to him the way she hasn’t clung to me in years. Like he’s the man she’s always wanted—and maybe, deep down, **the man I could never be.**

I turn slowly, my legs heavy, each step pulling me further away from everything I thought I knew. The rain greets me again as I step out into the street, cold and relentless, washing over me like a final, indifferent goodbye.

I feel like I’m falling, spinning, untethered from reality. Maybe I’m the fake. Maybe I’ve always been.

Or worse—maybe I just never deserved this life to begin with.

And now, someone better has taken it.",1,1729157226.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

1g5mv00,https://i.redd.it/jblefhbvbavd1.jpeg,I think I’m one of you now…,"Ok, I might have gone mad. Beginning of this month I got myself a first fountain pen in a while, the gold Pelikan Jazz, as I write daily and wanted to improve my handwriting. It started off a bit scratchy and was skipping on upward strokes at first (but with little time it became one of my favourites and all of a sudden started to write smoothly). Obviously, disappointed with the first purchase I needed a comparison so got myself two trusted Parkers, out of nostalgia - the Vector and Jotter in size M - turns out I definitely need an F so now waiting for two nib replacements to arrive (though I read there’s not much difference so planning to get a converter to use a dryer ink so I’d hopefully can use them more often). Also got a cheap Waterman Allure out of curiosity, this time an F and I just love it.
After that the madness continued and started searching for cheap vintage pens and found Parker 17, writes like butter but is super wet, so again time to invest in different ink maybe? Then came across Parker 45 from the 70s, by the looks of it - it was sold as Vector together with matching ballpoint, nib is extra fine and it’s now my favourite. The last one arrived today, Parker Inflection, unfortunately M nib again so won’t be using it much but I just love the design and colour.

I still have my eye on Shaeffer 9428 the coffee edition as well as Asvine V126 that I most likely will add to the collection next month. After that I shall stop… that is until I save up for more expensive pens that I dream of like Pelikan m300 or m400 and Waterman Carene 🙈",11,1729157112.0,fountainpens,3,1.0,False

","Navigating financial products like [Fixed Deposits (FD) and Life Insurance](https://datesfinserv.com/fd-vs-life-insurance/) can feel like venturing into a maze. Both are popular choices, but they serve entirely different purposes. To help you make an informed decision, we’ll dive into the nitty-gritty details of each. So, grab a cup of coffee, and let's figure this out together!

# What is a Fixed Deposit (FD)?

# Definition and Basics of FD

A Fixed Deposit (FD) is a financial instrument provided by banks and financial institutions that allows you to invest a lump sum of money for a fixed tenure at a predetermined interest rate. The rate of return is guaranteed, making FDs one of the safest investment options.

# How Does an FD Work?

When you invest in an [FD](https://datesfinserv.com/fd-vs-life-insurance/), the bank holds your money for a set period. During this time, the bank pays interest at a fixed rate, which is agreed upon when you open the deposit. At the end of the tenure, you receive your initial investment plus the accumulated interest.

# Key Features of Fixed Deposits

* **Guaranteed Returns:** Interest rates are fixed at the time of deposit.
* **Tenure Flexibility:** You can choose the tenure, ranging from a few months to several years.
* **Safe Investment:** FDs are low-risk and protected by deposit insurance up to a certain limit.",1,1729156916.0,IndiaFinance,0,1.0,False
1g5mtgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1g5mtgd/thank_you_for_a_wonderful_dream/,Thank You for a Wonderful Dream,"Hey, I’m not quite sure what to say other than thank you for everything.

Even though it was only a short time, I enjoyed every moment with you. Sure we are worlds apart, but I had fun romanticizing and dreaming together. We had such a great list of things we’d do together once we made it. Diving the Great Barrier Reef, Taipei 101 Observation Deck, exploring the National Parks… camping, having a picnic, falling in love… They were all such wonderful things we had wanted to reach towards together, from the grand to the mundane. You had such big dreams while all I wanted was to share in every moment together, big and small. We had such wonderful dreams and I can say that I loved every time I added another to the list. You made me smile so effortlessly, you made me feel so at ease, your simple words of encouragement meant so much to me. You have been all around great and I enjoyed the short time we had together.


But the cruel callousness of reality has to come back around. We are worlds apart in every sense of the word. You reach for the stars while I reach for the flowers. You strove forward so boldly while I stayed stagnant. You were my opposite and I loved it. We shared much in common regardless of how vastly different we were. But reality is, I’m not fit for you. I’m too broken, too lost, too far gone… no matter how much I wish it — want it — I’m not going to measure up. I’ll only be a hindrance, a burden in your life. I’m so tired. I’m dead exhausted. I’m running on empty. I have nothing left to give. God… I’m just so tired… I just want to go home… the world does not end, it continues to spin, but my world is collapsing and it’s swallowing me whole. Maybe in another life, another time… maybe if I was a different person, a better man… maybe then we can strive to complete our list.

Again, thank you for everything. In your light, I say a future. In your warmth, I felt no winter chill. I wish nothing but the best for you and I hope you’ll achieve all your goals. I’m sorry we wont get to plant that garden.

Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice on online dating, as I don’t have much experiences.

I met this guy (M, 44) on the dating app in early Sep, right when I was feeling worn out with online dating and considering a break. We chatted constantly, and I found him to be very intelligent and dedicated to his career, with a great sense of humor. However, he mentioned that he lives in San Diego and travels to Australia frequently, where I’m based.

The long-distance aspect initially threw me off because I worry it might be really challenging, and I’m a bit concerned he might only be looking for something casual, even though he says he’s interested in a long-term relationship. I asked him why he listed his location as Australia when he doesn’t live here, and he explained that it was the first day he signed up. His client, who lives in Australia, is in a relationship with someone in San Diego, told him how to change the location, and he thought it was romantic to met someone in Australia. After we connected, he changed his location back.

I’ve continued talking to him because he mentioned he’s open to the possibility of moving to Australia for six months to see if we can make it work. He runs a small company with a partner, so he has some flexibility with his work location. We’ve been getting to know each other slowly, discussing our backgrounds and interests.

A month later, he travelled to the city where I live, and we spent 9 hours together, from 12 PM to 9 PM. We had lunch at a Japanese restaurant and grabbed coffee afterward. I showed him around the city, and we enjoyed a lovely dinner at a romantic restaurant. We kept talking and laughing. This was the longest I’ve ever spent with someone on a first date, and it was amazing. I can’t quite express it, but I felt like he was the perfect person I’ve ever met.

Even though we come from very different backgrounds, we share similar views on life and easily get each other’s jokes. He kept expressing similar feelings throughout the day. The date ended with a sweet kiss, and he called an Uber for me.

One thing I wanted to mention is that he showed me his driver’s ID while we were discussing different laws in various states. He was also wearing a uniform T-shirt with his company logo under his casual business shirt. I looked him up online and found consistent information about him, so everything checks out. There are several articles online that provide detailed information about his work history.

He also mentioned that he plans to travel back to Australia in Dec for a couple of weeks since I told him I would have three weeks of annual leave and holidays during that time.  He seems to have a plan for us to spend time together.

This was followed by another date two days later after work. I ended up waiting about an hour because his business meeting ran late. When we finally met at a restaurant near his hotel, we quickly ordered some food and then headed to his hotel.

Before going to his hotel, I made it clear that I’m looking for a long-term relationship and that I’m not ready for sex. I also mentioned that while I’d love to come over, I wouldn’t be able to stay too late because I had an early morning meeting (which was a bit of an excuse, as I didn’t want to give him the wrong impression since he suggested I stay over). When he brought up the sleepover, I felt a bit concerned that he might just want something casual, so I clarified my feelings with him. He reassured me that he’s not rushing into anything and wouldn’t pressure me. He mentioned that he just wants to have some cuddles.

Throughout our time together, I felt comfortable and truly enjoyed being with him. We cuddled and talked about our past relationships and families. There was a strong chemistry between us, and we shared many kisses. While it felt a bit intense, we managed to keep things in check. He called an Uber for me and walked me to the door around 12am.

We also shared our feelings about the dates in the days that followed. He said I’m pretty and smart, and that we can engage in deeper conversations. I felt the same way.

He travelled to Japan the following week but mentioned he was considering returning to my city after his trip in late October (I asked him initially because it will be my birthday week). Unfortunately, he injured his back when he arrived at the airport in Japan. We’ve kept in touch, doing two video calls over the past week. Last night, he told me he wouldn’t be able to come back to Australia due to his back injury, as well as needing to move and visit family as planned.

During our call, we talked about how much we like each other and discussed a bit about the future. I mentioned that I’m open to moving in the future, but he would need to live in Australia for at least six months to see if the relationship can work. He has more flexibility with his schedule.

One concern I have is that he’s still on the dating app. I brought up the idea of exclusive dating, mentioning that it might be too early to discuss. He explained that he just started using the app and wants to get to know as more people as possibly to figure out who is the best one. He doesn’t want to invest one or two years only to find out the relationship isn’t right. He said he needs to be conscious of not getting hurt or hurting me. He’s currently chatting with two other women in San Diego but hasn’t met them yet. He wants to keep his options open there, but he also mentioned he’ll be back in Australia from mid-Dec until Feb to see if it can work between us.

I know long-distance relationships can be challenging, but I really like him and want to give it a try. A good friend of mime advised me to be realistic and keep my options open, but I’m feeling a bit tired of dating. After matching with over 150 guys in three months and ending up with nothing, I’d rather focus on myself—like getting into tennis, dancing, and joining hiking clubs. But on the other hand, I can’t shake the anxiety about getting older & he’s meeting someone else.

**So here are my questions:**

1. It bothers me that he’s still dating someone in his hometown. I’m worried that our strong feelings might fade between now and mid-December when we meet again. I know he’s the only one who knows what he wants, but do you think he’s still on the app because he doesn’t see me as the best match? How can I maintain our strong connection while we’re apart for the next two months? What i could do to change his mind?
2. I’m likely going to take myself off the app. Should I tell him? What impact might that have?
3. He seems very honest, and I really like him, but am I overlooking any red flags due to my lack of experience?

Anyone in the similar situation before? Any other advice would be greatly appreciated. Please don’t judge me—I’m usually not this brave when it comes to relationships.",1,1729156862.0,Bumble,3,1.0,False
1g5mt0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_GreenlaneDentalPract/comments/1g5mt0y/unlocking_your_best_smile_exploring_the_world_of/,Unlocking Your Best Smile: Exploring the World of Modern Dental Care,"A great smile is more than just an attractive feature—it’s a key part of feeling confident and healthy. Thanks to advances in dental technology, maintaining and enhancing your smile has never been easier. Whether you're looking for preventive care, restorative treatments, or aesthetic improvements, modern dental services offer solutions that cater to a wide range of needs. From routine cleanings to advanced procedures, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know about unlocking the best version of your smile.

# Preventive Care: The Foundation of Oral Health

The journey to a healthy smile begins with preventive care. Regular visits to your [**Dentist Leigh**](https://www.greenlanedentalpractice.co.uk/) for cleanings and check-ups play a crucial role in keeping your mouth healthy. These appointments help catch potential problems early, such as cavities or gum issues, before they can escalate into more serious conditions.

During a routine visit, your dentist will typically clean your teeth, removing plaque and tartar that you might have missed during your daily brushing and flossing. They’ll also examine your mouth for signs of decay, gum disease, or other issues. Preventive care is essential in avoiding costly and uncomfortable procedures down the road.

Regular visits to the dentist, combined with good hygiene practices at home, ensure that your smile remains bright and healthy for years to come. Don’t wait until there’s a problem—taking a proactive approach to your oral health is the key to preventing bigger issues in the future.

# Restorative Treatments: Bringing Back Function and Health

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, things go wrong—maybe it’s a cracked tooth, a cavity, or even a missing tooth. When this happens, restorative treatments can step in to bring back the health and function of your teeth.

Fillings are one of the most common restorative treatments, used to repair teeth that have been damaged by decay. They blend seamlessly with your natural teeth, so no one will even know they’re there. If you have a tooth that’s been weakened or damaged, crowns can be placed over it to restore its strength and appearance.

For missing teeth, bridges are an effective way to fill the gap and prevent your other teeth from shifting out of place. Each of these restorative solutions is designed to look natural, so you can feel confident that your smile will remain both functional and beautiful.

# Straightening Your Smile: Achieving Perfect Alignment

Not everyone is born with perfectly aligned teeth, but that doesn’t mean you have to live with a crooked smile. One of the most popular services offered today is [**Teeth straightening Leigh**](https://www.greenlanedentalpractice.co.uk/treatment/align/), which offers a comfortable, discreet solution for those who want to correct misalignment.

Traditional braces are still an option, but many people now opt for clear aligners. These custom-made, removable aligners gradually move your teeth into the desired position over time. Unlike metal braces, aligners are nearly invisible, making them an ideal choice for adults who want a more subtle approach to straightening their teeth.

Aligners are also more convenient since they can be removed when eating or drinking, which means you won’t have to worry about any food restrictions during your treatment. Whether you're dealing with crowding, gaps, or bite issues, Teeth straightening Leigh can help you achieve the smile you’ve always wanted.

# Whitening Treatments: Brighten Your Smile

A bright smile can do wonders for your confidence, but over time, staining from coffee, wine, and other foods can dull your teeth’s natural shine. Professional whitening treatments offer a quick and effective way to restore the brilliance of your smile.

While there are many over-the-counter options available, nothing beats the results you get from a professional treatment. Dentists use stronger, more effective whitening agents that provide faster and longer-lasting results. Whether you’re preparing for a big event or simply want to refresh your smile, whitening is a popular choice for enhancing your appearance.

The results of a professional whitening treatment are noticeable right away, and with proper care, they can last for months. Regular touch-ups and avoiding stain-causing foods can help maintain your results and keep your smile looking bright and beautiful.

# Working with a Specialist: Aesthetic Treatments

If you’re looking to enhance your smile beyond whitening or straightening, working with a [**Cosmetic dentist Leigh**](https://www.greenlanedentalpractice.co.uk/treatment/smile-makeovers/) can open up a world of possibilities. Specialists in aesthetic procedures focus on improving the appearance of your smile, whether through veneers, bonding, or contouring.

Veneers are thin, custom-made shells that cover the front surface of your teeth, providing a perfect, uniform appearance. They’re great for hiding imperfections like chips, cracks, or discoloration. Bonding, on the other hand, involves applying a tooth-colored resin to repair minor damage and reshape the teeth. It’s a quick and affordable way to enhance your smile with minimal invasiveness.

If you’re looking for a more comprehensive makeover, your Cosmetic dentist Leigh can create a treatment plan tailored to your unique goals. Whether it’s a subtle enhancement or a complete transformation, aesthetic services provide endless possibilities for creating the smile of your dreams.

# Implants: A Permanent Solution to Missing Teeth

Losing a tooth doesn’t have to be a permanent setback. Thanks to modern technology, implants offer a long-lasting solution for missing teeth, allowing you to restore both function and appearance. An implant is essentially a titanium post that is surgically placed into the jawbone, where it serves as a replacement root for a missing tooth.

Once the implant has healed, a crown is placed on top, giving the appearance of a natural tooth. Implants not only restore your smile but also help preserve the structure of your jaw by preventing bone loss, which often occurs after losing a tooth.

Because they are designed to last for many years, implants are considered one of the best options for those looking for a reliable and permanent fix to missing teeth.

# Caring for Gums: The Silent Foundation of a Healthy Smile

When thinking about your smile, it’s easy to focus on your teeth—but don’t forget about your gums! Healthy gums are just as important as healthy teeth, and issues like gum disease can lead to serious problems if left untreated.

Gum disease starts with plaque build-up, which can cause redness, swelling, and even bleeding. If caught early, it can be treated with deep cleanings and improved hygiene habits. However, if it progresses, more advanced treatments like scaling and root planing may be necessary.

Regular visits to your Dentist Leigh will help ensure that your gums stay healthy, and that any early signs of disease are caught and treated before they become more serious.

# Why Regular Check-Ups Matter

It’s easy to forget about your oral health until something goes wrong, but regular check-ups are essential for maintaining a healthy smile. Your Dentist Leigh can monitor your teeth and gums for any changes, ensuring that problems are caught early and treated before they worsen.

Routine visits also provide an opportunity to discuss any concerns you might have, whether it’s about your current hygiene routine or future treatments you’re considering, like Teeth straightening Leigh or whitening. Staying proactive about your oral health can save you from more invasive and expensive procedures down the line.

# A Smile for Every Stage of Life

No matter your age, maintaining a healthy smile is important. Whether it’s a child getting their first check-up or an adult exploring options like implants or veneers, personalized care ensures that everyone gets the attention they need.

For children, early check-ups help establish good hygiene habits and catch any developmental issues. Teens and adults may be more interested in Teeth straightening Leigh or whitening, while older adults might need restorative solutions like implants or dentures.

Each stage of life brings unique challenges, but with the right care, everyone can enjoy a healthy, confident smile.

# Conclusion: Invest in Your Smile

Your smile is one of your most valuable assets, and investing in its care will pay off in both health and confidence. Whether you’re focusing on prevention, looking for ways to improve your smile with Teeth straightening Leigh, or consulting a Cosmetic dentist Leigh for aesthetic treatments, modern clinics offer solutions that can help you achieve the smile of your dreams.

Don’t wait—take the first step toward a healthier, more beautiful smile today! Regular check-ups, personalized treatments, and advanced technology make it easier than ever to enjoy a confident, radiant smile that will last a lifetime.",1,1729156849.0,u_GreenlaneDentalPract,0,1.0,False

When he gets his paychecks he almost always withraws the money and sends them away to africa or to repay debts from donors. (Remittances to africa are a huge reason why we are on the same low income level ven years after arriving in the west). We have always been on government housing and off and on again on welfare. im so envious of other families of our immigrant community whos parents actually do the bare minimum for their family. he never even learned how to drive or got a car. we had to carry heavy groceries long distances and take public transport constantly. it was a toll on my mom especially. who has weak legs and who works constantly to bring food on the table (her biggest dream is for me to get car so i can drive her places, sadly such  a basic thing is a dream come true for her).  

He has a savior complex and narcissitic tendencies (gaslights you and degrades you if you confront him) and always spends thousands of dollars to leave our home and go do chairty work in africa and is always on the computer with his back hunched and his eyes glued close to the screen writing letters to churches, charities and richer white people. he's basically a professional beggar. he puts this fake persona of a happy go lucky pure hearted guy who wants to save people to our church and other people but in reality doesnt care to end his own familys pover and is content with his wife and kids barely scrapping by and sending him money to feed him while hes in africa.  He doesnt care that hes poor and eats usually only one meal a day even in the west. He's content with the situation here. If he took advantage of the great opportunities in the west and worked hard and aquired more wealth than wouldnt he have more money to help the needy back home??). He's boasted saying, ""yes im poor but atleast i have no debt!"" and gossips about how other families have debt due to them actually buying their houses and other things that are actually positive lol. 

Everytime my little sister or me asks for some money he never has any not even 5 dollars. my sister doesnt even know why hes in the house and wished he'd go to africa and never come back as she sees him as basically some useless stranger in our house (we never have conversations with him when he comes downstairs we go upstairs). he cares more about the opinions of others than his own family. He makes himself out to appear as some rich wealthy savior to people back in africa while in reality hes unemployed and has to rely on my mom working like a slave to send money to him while hes there (along with money to other relatives), people  back home even make fun of him behind his back (hes considered an akward weirdo even back in his country) and only want his money. I hate the facade hes put on for our local church and any other donor. i regret not telling our pastor my grievances. lately hes even been asking me for money and taking loose change from my sister so he can buy coffee and hang out there all day with his friends. Hes a mommas boy and it seems he cares more about his mother than us. he said he has to go visit africa every six months now for his mother and i just found out from my sister (he never tells me anything himself) that he's planning on leaving again next month evwn afte telling me last year he was going to focus on getting a job (he still hasnt to this day since then even tho he apparently has gone on interviews he seems to have suddenly chnaged his mind or was pretending to look seem like he was searching for work).

I have a round dark oak breakfast table, and both my couch and TV bench (also dark oak) have visible legs. While my whole TV bench isn’t in the picture, I’ll link one below for context.

I’m debating whether to get a coffee table with legs or without. Would adding another piece with legs make the space feel too ""leggy"" or unbalanced? Does it matter if the majority of my furniture already has legs?

I’m also torn between a round or rectangular coffee table. Since my breakfast table is round, I’m worried that another round table might feel repetitive or disrupt the balance. Would a rectangular table be a better choice, or is round still a good option?

PS: I plan on adding a carpet, curtains, better lighting, and other décor touches soon, so the space will evolve. Any advice would be appreciated!

1g5mo3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1g5mo3u/the_better_me/,The Better Me,"I wake up to the sound of rain tapping against the windows of the studio apartment in Portland I share with my wife Amber. Where everything smells faintly of coffee grounds and mildew. A sour tang lingers in the air—a scent I can’t place but makes my stomach turn.

My phone lies dead next to me on the nightstand. Strange. I could've sworn I plugged in the charger last night. I sit up, rubbing the sleep from my eyes, and the ache in my muscles feels deeper than it should, like I’ve been lying in the same position for days. My clothes—yesterday’s clothes—cling to my skin with the stale odor of sweat, as if I’ve lived in them far too long.

The clock reads 10:42 AM.

I never sleep in this late on a weekday.

A cold sense of dread creeps in as I stagger out of bed. My car keys aren’t on the hook by the door. My laptop is missing from the desk.

I shuffle toward the kitchen, each step heavy, like my body’s forgotten how to move. As I round the corner, our dog, Baxter, stands in the middle of the room—stiff, tail low, hackles raised. His lips peel back, exposing teeth in a way I've never seen before.

“Bax? Hey, buddy…” My voice cracks.

He growls, low and guttural, like I’m someone he’s never met. His eyes—usually soft and eager—are wild now, tracking my every movement, a predator sizing me up.

“Come on, it’s me.” I take a cautious step forward, but he lunges, snapping the air just inches from my hand. I stumble back, heart hammering.

The worst part isn’t the aggression—it’s the look in his eyes. There’s no recognition. None.

I barely manage to sidestep as Baxter snaps again, teeth clicking shut with a sharp *clack*. My heart races, and I grab the doorknob with trembling hands, wrenching it open just in time. I stumble out into the hallway, slamming the door behind me as his paws scrape furiously against the wood.

When I get to the curb outside, my car is gone.

Panic hums under my skin as I jog through the wet streets toward my office building downtown. The rain clings to me like a second skin, but I barely feel it. My pulse hammers in my ears. Something’s wrong. Everything’s wrong.

At the office entrance, I swipe my badge. The little beep sounds, but the turnstile won’t budge. I try again, but nothing happens.

The security guard at the front desk eyes me. “Can I help you?” he asks, polite but wary.

“Yeah, I—” I clear my throat. “I work here. Daniel Clarke. Marketing.”

The guard frowns and types something into his computer. He squints at the screen, then back at me. “Says here Daniel Clarke already checked in. About thirty minutes ago.”

The room tilts. My heart skips a beat. “What?”

The guard looks concerned.

“Look, man,” he says carefully, like he’s trying not to spook me. “You okay? You want me to call someone?”

I push past him before he can finish. “I need to get upstairs.”

He calls out after me, but I’m already in the elevator, jabbing the button for the eleventh floor. Each second that ticks by feels like a countdown to something inevitable and awful. The door opens with a chime, and I step into the familiar buzz of the open-concept office. Phones ringing. Keyboards clacking.

And then I see him.

He’s sitting at **my desk**, typing away with an easy, practiced smile. He glances up casually, and for a second, my brain short-circuits. Because the man in my chair—the one joking with Jason from accounting, drinking from my coffee mug, and wearing my watch—**is me.**

No. Not exactly. He’s… better. His jawline is sharper, his skin is clearer, his clothes fit perfectly—not rumpled or wrinkled like mine. Even his hair, always a little limp no matter what I do, is thick and swept back like he just walked off a photoshoot. He’s me without the flaws.

Jason claps him on the shoulder with a grin. “Congrats again, man! That promotion’s long overdue.”

My stomach twists. **The promotion. My promotion.** The one I’d been grinding for—sacrificing weekends, working overtime, skipping dinners with Amber—just to prove I was good enough.

“Thanks, bro,” The imposter’s voice is smooth and warm—like mine, but without the hesitation, the doubt.

I step forward, my voice trembling with anger. “Hey! Get the fuck out of my chair.”

The room falls silent. Heads turn. Every eye in the office locks on me, and for a moment, nobody moves. Jason shifts uncomfortably. A few coworkers whisper to each other, casting uneasy glances in my direction.

The other me tilts his head and smiles—cool, calm, and collected. “Sorry… Do I know you?”

Something snaps inside me. I slam my hands down on the desk. “I **am** Daniel Clarke! That’s my desk, you fucking fraud!”

Jason steps in front of him, his expression tight with confusion—and just a little bit of fear. “Hey, buddy,” he says, his tone low and careful. “I don’t know who you are but you need to leave. Right now. Before we call security.”

I open my mouth to protest, but two guards are already behind me, hands clamping around my arms.

The pity on everyone’s faces as they watch me being hauled away burns like acid in my chest.

They drag me out, toss me into the cold rain, and slam the door shut behind me. I sit there for a moment on the slick pavement, stunned, the rain washing over me. People pass by without a glance—just another nobody on the street.

I dig through my pockets, fingers trembling, and pull out my wallet. My driver’s license is gone—replaced by a blank, plastic card. No name. No photo. No address. Just empty space where I used to exist.

I don’t go straight home.

For the next two hours, I wander the streets in the rain, my coat soaked through, searching for answers. I call my cell service provider from a payphone, but my number has already been transferred to a new device. My bank? Same story. A new password was set this morning, and they won’t tell me more without “proper ID.”

I try calling Amber. No answer. I dial twice more—straight to voicemail.

At first, I think I’ve been hacked. But nothing fits. **How did they get my face? My voice? My fucking memories?**

I head to the police station next, but as soon as I tell them someone’s stolen my life—and that person looks and sounds exactly like me—the officer at the desk gives me this look. **Like I’m unstable. Like I’m a problem.**

\_\_\_\_

When I finally circle back home, the door to the apartment won’t budge. My key isn’t on me, and the doormat where we keep a spare is empty. I bang on the door, calling for Amber, but she doesn’t answer.

I circle the building, drenched, heart racing. The fire escape on the side—our usual shortcut when we forget our keys—is still there. One of the windows is cracked open, just enough to squeeze through. I haul myself up, the metal ladder groaning under my weight. My wet clothes stick to the rust, but I don't care. I just need to get inside. I need to see Amber. She’ll know what’s going on. She *has* to.

I slide the window up and pull myself in, landing awkwardly on the hardwood.

As I reach the hallway leading to the bedroom, I hear it—a low, rhythmic groan. My pulse stutters. I creep forward, trying not to make a sound. The door to our bedroom is ajar, light spilling from the crack. I push it open with trembling fingers.

I know what I’m going to find before I see it.

The bedroom smells of sweat and exertion, a scent so thick I gag on it. My wife, Amber, lies sprawled across the bed, glowing with satisfaction. Her dark hair is a wild tangle against the pillows, and she’s breathing in short, happy gasps—the kind I haven’t heard from her in a long time.

At the foot of the bed, **he** kneels between her legs. My face. My body. My voice, murmuring something low and soft. He wipes his mouth, still hard, and grins when he sees me standing in the doorway. **He doesn’t even bother covering himself.**

Amber lets out a dazed, satisfied laugh. “Oh my God, Dan… That was… you’ve never done that before.” She shivers, her skin flushed and glowing. “What got into you?”

I step forward, trembling. “Amber…”

Her head snaps toward me, and the joy drains from her face, replaced by confusion—then fear. She pulls the sheet over her body like I’m a stranger who just broke in.

“Who the fuck are you?” she whispers, her voice sharp with panic.

My throat tightens. “It’s me… It’s Daniel! I’m your husband!”

Her eyes dart to the other me—the perfect me, the **better** me—and I see the moment her confusion dissolves into certainty. She presses herself closer to him, trembling. “Dan, call the police!”

He gets off the bed slowly, lazily, like he has all the time in the world. “It’s okay, babe,” he murmurs, brushing her hair from her face. “He’s just confused.” He turns to me, still smiling that infuriating, perfect smile. “But you need to leave now. This isn’t your life anymore.”

I stagger backward, heart hammering, the walls closing in around me. “No. No, you’re the fake. You’re the fucking fake!”

Amber sobs, burying her face in his chest. He wraps his arms around her, comforting her, **owning her**, and something inside me crumbles. She clings to him the way she hasn’t clung to me in years. Like he’s the man she’s always wanted—and maybe, deep down, **the man I could never be.**

I turn slowly, my legs heavy, each step pulling me further away from everything I thought I knew. The rain greets me again as I step out into the street, cold and relentless, washing over me like a final, indifferent goodbye.

I feel like I’m falling, spinning, untethered from reality. Maybe I’m the fake. Maybe I’ve always been.

Or worse—maybe I just never deserved this life to begin with.

At the foot of the bed, **he** kneels between her legs. My face. My body. My voice, murmuring something low and soft. He wipes his mouth, still hard, and grins when he sees me standing in the doorway. **He doesn’t even bother covering himself.**

Amber lets out a dazed, satisfied laugh. “Oh my God, Dan… That was… you’ve never done that before.” She shivers, her skin flushed and glowing. “What got into you?”

I step forward, trembling. “Amber…”

Her head snaps toward me, and the joy drains from her face, replaced by confusion—then fear. She pulls the sheet over her body like I’m a stranger who just broke in.

“Who the fuck are you?” she whispers, her voice sharp with panic.

My throat tightens. “It’s me… It’s Daniel! I’m your husband!”

Her eyes dart to the other me—the perfect me, the **better** me—and I see the moment her confusion dissolves into certainty. She presses herself closer to him, trembling. “Dan, call the police!”

He gets off the bed slowly, lazily, like he has all the time in the world. “It’s okay, babe,” he murmurs, brushing her hair from her face. “He’s just confused.” He turns to me, still smiling that infuriating, perfect smile. “But you need to leave now. This isn’t your life anymore.”

I stagger backward, heart hammering, the walls closing in around me. “No. No, you’re the fake. You’re the fucking fake!”

Amber sobs, burying her face in his chest. He wraps his arms around her, comforting her, **owning her**, and something inside me crumbles. She clings to him the way she hasn’t clung to me in years. Like he’s the man she’s always wanted—and maybe, deep down, **the man I could never be.**

I turn slowly, my legs heavy, each step pulling me further away from everything I thought I knew. The rain greets me again as I step out into the street, cold and relentless, washing over me like a final, indifferent goodbye.

I feel like I’m falling, spinning, untethered from reality. Maybe I’m the fake. Maybe I’ve always been.

Or worse—maybe I just never deserved this life to begin with.

1g5mn72,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1g5mn72/the_better_me/,The Better Me,"I wake up to the sound of rain tapping against the windows of the studio apartment in Portland I share with my wife Amber. Where everything smells faintly of coffee grounds and mildew. A sour tang lingers in the air—a scent I can’t place but makes my stomach turn.

My phone lies dead next to me on the nightstand. Strange. I could've sworn I plugged in the charger last night. I sit up, rubbing the sleep from my eyes, and the ache in my muscles feels deeper than it should, like I’ve been lying in the same position for days. My clothes—yesterday’s clothes—cling to my skin with the stale odor of sweat, as if I’ve lived in them far too long.

The clock reads 10:42 AM.

I never sleep in this late on a weekday.

A cold sense of dread creeps in as I stagger out of bed. My car keys aren’t on the hook by the door. My laptop is missing from the desk.

I shuffle toward the kitchen, each step heavy, like my body’s forgotten how to move. As I round the corner, our dog, Baxter, stands in the middle of the room—stiff, tail low, hackles raised. His lips peel back, exposing teeth in a way I've never seen before.

“Bax? Hey, buddy…” My voice cracks.

He growls, low and guttural, like I’m someone he’s never met. His eyes—usually soft and eager—are wild now, tracking my every movement, a predator sizing me up.

“Come on, it’s me.” I take a cautious step forward, but he lunges, snapping the air just inches from my hand. I stumble back, heart hammering.

The worst part isn’t the aggression—it’s the look in his eyes. There’s no recognition. None.

I barely manage to sidestep as Baxter snaps again, teeth clicking shut with a sharp *clack*. My heart races, and I grab the doorknob with trembling hands, wrenching it open just in time. I stumble out into the hallway, slamming the door behind me as his paws scrape furiously against the wood.

When I get to the curb outside, my car is gone.

Panic hums under my skin as I jog through the wet streets toward my office building downtown. The rain clings to me like a second skin, but I barely feel it. My pulse hammers in my ears. Something’s wrong. Everything’s wrong.

At the office entrance, I swipe my badge. The little beep sounds, but the turnstile won’t budge. I try again, but nothing happens.

The security guard at the front desk eyes me. “Can I help you?” he asks, polite but wary.

“Yeah, I—” I clear my throat. “I work here. Daniel Clarke. Marketing.”

The guard frowns and types something into his computer. He squints at the screen, then back at me. “Says here Daniel Clarke already checked in. About thirty minutes ago.”

The room tilts. My heart skips a beat. “What?”

The guard looks concerned.

“Look, man,” he says carefully, like he’s trying not to spook me. “You okay? You want me to call someone?”

I push past him before he can finish. “I need to get upstairs.”

He calls out after me, but I’m already in the elevator, jabbing the button for the eleventh floor. Each second that ticks by feels like a countdown to something inevitable and awful. The door opens with a chime, and I step into the familiar buzz of the open-concept office. Phones ringing. Keyboards clacking.

And then I see him.

He’s sitting at **my desk**, typing away with an easy, practiced smile. He glances up casually, and for a second, my brain short-circuits. Because the man in my chair—the one joking with Jason from accounting, drinking from my coffee mug, and wearing my watch—**is me.**

No. Not exactly. He’s… better. His jawline is sharper, his skin is clearer, his clothes fit perfectly—not rumpled or wrinkled like mine. Even his hair, always a little limp no matter what I do, is thick and swept back like he just walked off a photoshoot. He’s me without the flaws.

Jason claps him on the shoulder with a grin. “Congrats again, man! That promotion’s long overdue.”

My stomach twists. **The promotion. My promotion.** The one I’d been grinding for—sacrificing weekends, working overtime, skipping dinners with Amber—just to prove I was good enough.

“Thanks, bro,” The imposter’s voice is smooth and warm—like mine, but without the hesitation, the doubt.

I step forward, my voice trembling with anger. “Hey! Get the fuck out of my chair.”

The room falls silent. Heads turn. Every eye in the office locks on me, and for a moment, nobody moves. Jason shifts uncomfortably. A few coworkers whisper to each other, casting uneasy glances in my direction.

The other me tilts his head and smiles—cool, calm, and collected. “Sorry… Do I know you?”

Something snaps inside me. I slam my hands down on the desk. “I **am** Daniel Clarke! That’s my desk, you fucking fraud!”

Jason steps in front of him, his expression tight with confusion—and just a little bit of fear. “Hey, buddy,” he says, his tone low and careful. “I don’t know who you are but you need to leave. Right now. Before we call security.”

I open my mouth to protest, but two guards are already behind me, hands clamping around my arms.

The pity on everyone’s faces as they watch me being hauled away burns like acid in my chest.

They drag me out, toss me into the cold rain, and slam the door shut behind me. I sit there for a moment on the slick pavement, stunned, the rain washing over me. People pass by without a glance—just another nobody on the street.

I dig through my pockets, fingers trembling, and pull out my wallet. My driver’s license is gone—replaced by a blank, plastic card. No name. No photo. No address. Just empty space where I used to exist.

I don’t go straight home.

For the next two hours, I wander the streets in the rain, my coat soaked through, searching for answers. I call my cell service provider from a payphone, but my number has already been transferred to a new device. My bank? Same story. A new password was set this morning, and they won’t tell me more without “proper ID.”

I try calling Amber. No answer. I dial twice more—straight to voicemail.

At first, I think I’ve been hacked. But nothing fits. **How did they get my face? My voice? My fucking memories?**

I head to the police station next, but as soon as I tell them someone’s stolen my life—and that person looks and sounds exactly like me—the officer at the desk gives me this look. **Like I’m unstable. Like I’m a problem.**

\_\_\_\_

When I finally circle back home, the door to the apartment won’t budge. My key isn’t on me, and the doormat where we keep a spare is empty. I bang on the door, calling for Amber, but she doesn’t answer.

I circle the building, drenched, heart racing. The fire escape on the side—our usual shortcut when we forget our keys—is still there. One of the windows is cracked open, just enough to squeeze through. I haul myself up, the metal ladder groaning under my weight. My wet clothes stick to the rust, but I don't care. I just need to get inside. I need to see Amber. She’ll know what’s going on. She *has* to.

I slide the window up and pull myself in, landing awkwardly on the hardwood.

As I reach the hallway leading to the bedroom, I hear it—a low, rhythmic groan. My pulse stutters. I creep forward, trying not to make a sound. The door to our bedroom is ajar, light spilling from the crack. I push it open with trembling fingers.

I know what I’m going to find before I see it.

The bedroom smells of sweat and exertion, a scent so thick I gag on it. My wife, Amber, lies sprawled across the bed, glowing with satisfaction. Her dark hair is a wild tangle against the pillows, and she’s breathing in short, happy gasps—the kind I haven’t heard from her in a long time.

He gets off the bed slowly, lazily, like he has all the time in the world. “It’s okay, babe,” he murmurs, brushing her hair from her face. “He’s just confused.” He turns to me, still smiling that infuriating, perfect smile. “But you need to leave now. This isn’t your life anymore.”

I stagger backward, heart hammering, the walls closing in around me. “No. No, you’re the fake. You’re the fucking fake!”

Amber sobs, burying her face in his chest. He wraps his arms around her, comforting her, **owning her**, and something inside me crumbles. She clings to him the way she hasn’t clung to me in years. Like he’s the man she’s always wanted—and maybe, deep down, **the man I could never be.**

I turn slowly, my legs heavy, each step pulling me further away from everything I thought I knew. The rain greets me again as I step out into the street, cold and relentless, washing over me like a final, indifferent goodbye.

I feel like I’m falling, spinning, untethered from reality. Maybe I’m the fake. Maybe I’ve always been.

Or worse—maybe I just never deserved this life to begin with.

1g5mlcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g5mlcd/wibtah_for_reporting_a_spa_manager_to_their_boss/,WIBTAH For Reporting a Spa Manager to Their Boss?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons, names changed for privacy, etc. Fair warning: this has been an ongoing issue and there is a lot of context and discussions to mention, so this post will be long.

I (F28) am a manager of a hybrid store/cafe based in the lifestyle centre of a residential gated community. There is a spa in the lifestyle centre, the manager of which has put me in a rather uncomfortable situation. We shall call her ""Vicky"".

Vicky comes across as one of those girls that didn't have to try very hard because she's very good at acting cute and dumb and she's pretty (? I don't think she is, but she clearly thinks so). However, she clearly uses these factors to manipulate people into doing things for her.

Vicky approached me about a month ago because she wanted to ""collaborate"" with our business, as they're struggling keep the residents coming back and the spa is struggling financially. However, her idea of ""collaborating"" means we would be giving the spa free booze and meals as part of packages they want to offer their customers. She was completely bewildered when I told her that what's she's proposing doesn't actually post any benefit to us, so it's not really a collaboration and I wasn't willing to just give them free stock (head office would kill me). She basically spent the next 15 minutes trying to convince me that the reason they're struggling is because we're stealing her customers (false, we are not competitors in the slightest) and it would be the ""right thing to do"". I told her I was happy to give her my email address so she can send through a proposal to review, but otherwise I was done with the conversation. She said she would get right on that, and left the store.

She has come in several times since to ""check in with me"" and ""remind"" me that she still owes me a proposal. She comes into the store regularly to buy drinks and food, and spend the bulk of that time talking to one of my baristas, ""Bonnie"". Cut to last week, I went behind the coffee bar for something and that Bonnie had handwritten and full 3 page proposal on Vicky's behalf. This is an issue for many reasons, mainly that her contract states that she cannot do work for other companies while employed with us (a labour law in my country), and especially not on company time. I spoke to Bonnie about this and she told me that whenever Vicky comes into the store and talks to her she complains about my ""lack of help"" with the proposal, that she doesn't know how to do a proposal, and if she doesn't get the spa to start making more money she's going to be fired, she's a single mom, she needs this job, etc so Bonnie offered to help because she felt sorry for her. I told Bonnie that unfortunately she's not contractually not allowed to do this and that she has to tell Vicky that she needs to do her own job. Unfortunately this counted as a disciplinary discussion, but I left it at a verbal warning because her heart was in the right place and she was trying to do something nice.

  
Last Saturday Vicky comes to the store, telling me that it's her day off but she came in specifically to see me (baby on hip, not in uniform). She then basically vented about how she doesn't actually know what a proposal is because ""she's never been in business before"" (but has a business diploma and management certificate?). She asked me if it's the same as a business pitch deck or a CV. I said no, and told her that there are plenty of examples on google that she could refer to, to which she said ""that's plagiarism though"". I told her that it's only plagiarism if you copy someone's work directly and call it your own, her reply being, ""it's fine, I asked Bonnie to do the proposal for me"". I told her that I was aware and that it was completely inappropriate, that Bonnie had to be disciplined because of it (explaining the contract stuff, laws, etc), and that she's been told not to be involved at all going forward. She apologised, and then proceeded to try and get me to do the proposal for her. I told her I simply would not because I'm not only the manager of the store, but also the marketing manager and a senior manager at a different dept so I simply do not have the time or the desire to write a proposal geared towards my own company on her behalf. I told her I was done talking about this again, and told her that the only discussion I would have with hr going forward would be once she sent the proposal through to my email address, and not to approach my staff about it again. She said she understood and left.

I was off the next day, but on Monday Bonnie came to me and told me that Vicky had come in on Sunday to talk to her about the proposal. She apologised to Bonnie about getting her in trouble, and then proceeded to try to get Bonnie to do the proposal again, stating that ""if the issue is with Bonnie doing the proposal during her shift, then she should do it either during her lunch break or on her days off."" Bonnie said that she typically eats whilst working because we're short staff (a barista resigned 2 weeks ago) and that she goes to see her kids on her days off, but ultimately she doesn't want to regardless. Vicky then asked Bonnie if she could still use the handwritten proposal, and Bonnie told her that if I received the proposal and it was word-for-word identical to the written proposal Bonnie had done that I would reject the proposal outright. Vicky then tells her that that's going to be a problem then because she already submitted Bonnie's proposal through to her bosses, as her own work, for approval. Bonnie told her that then the conversation doesn't need to continue and that if she wants to speak to anyone about the proposal it has to be her boss (me), and went back to work.

To say I'm livid is an understatement. Even after the unprofessional and, frankly, rude behaviour from her up until this point, I felt sorry because Vicky was clearly desperate and I know that desperation can make people behave in weird ways. But the fact that this woman is so clearly unwilling to do her own damn job that she's willing to put my employees in the same position she finds herself in (job instability) after she knew that Bonnie had already gotten into trouble for doing a proposal for her and then further trying to manipulate her into doing it AGAIN is so infuriating that I will be rejecting her proposal regardless of how good it is because I refuse to work with someone so unethical and underhanded. However, I also think I should report her to her boss because I think she (her boss) deserves to know how this manager is behaving. I'm not at all surprised that the spa isn't doing so well if the manager so clearly doesn't know how to do her job (her staff complain to us all the time about her lack of ability and understanding).  
Some of my colleagues thinks it would be out of line to get ah old of Vicky's boss, but I'm at my wits end at this point. I'm in such an uncomfortable position.

So would I be TAH if I reported Vicky to her boss?",9,1729155892.0,AITAH,23,1.0,False
1g5ml8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1g5ml8w/the_better_me/,The Better Me,"I wake up to the sound of rain tapping against the windows of the studio apartment in Portland I share with my wife Amber. Where everything smells faintly of coffee grounds and mildew. A sour tang lingers in the air—a scent I can’t place but makes my stomach turn.

My phone lies dead next to me on the nightstand. Strange. I could've sworn I plugged in the charger last night. I sit up, rubbing the sleep from my eyes, and the ache in my muscles feels deeper than it should, like I’ve been lying in the same position for days. My clothes—yesterday’s clothes—cling to my skin with the stale odor of sweat, as if I’ve lived in them far too long.

The clock reads 10:42 AM.

I never sleep in this late on a weekday.

A cold sense of dread creeps in as I stagger out of bed. My car keys aren’t on the hook by the door. My laptop is missing from the desk.

I shuffle toward the kitchen, each step heavy, like my body’s forgotten how to move. As I round the corner, our dog, Baxter, stands in the middle of the room—stiff, tail low, hackles raised. His lips peel back, exposing teeth in a way I've never seen before.

“Bax? Hey, buddy…” My voice cracks.

He growls, low and guttural, like I’m someone he’s never met. His eyes—usually soft and eager—are wild now, tracking my every movement, a predator sizing me up.

“Come on, it’s me.” I take a cautious step forward, but he lunges, snapping the air just inches from my hand. I stumble back, heart hammering.

The worst part isn’t the aggression—it’s the look in his eyes. There’s no recognition. None.

I barely manage to sidestep as Baxter snaps again, teeth clicking shut with a sharp *clack*. My heart races, and I grab the doorknob with trembling hands, wrenching it open just in time. I stumble out into the hallway, slamming the door behind me as his paws scrape furiously against the wood.

When I get to the curb outside, my car is gone.

Panic hums under my skin as I jog through the wet streets toward my office building downtown. The rain clings to me like a second skin, but I barely feel it. My pulse hammers in my ears. Something’s wrong. Everything’s wrong.

At the office entrance, I swipe my badge. The little beep sounds, but the turnstile won’t budge. I try again, but nothing happens.

The security guard at the front desk eyes me. “Can I help you?” he asks, polite but wary.

“Yeah, I—” I clear my throat. “I work here. Daniel Clarke. Marketing.”

The guard frowns and types something into his computer. He squints at the screen, then back at me. “Says here Daniel Clarke already checked in. About thirty minutes ago.”

The room tilts. My heart skips a beat. “What?”

The guard looks concerned.

“Look, man,” he says carefully, like he’s trying not to spook me. “You okay? You want me to call someone?”

I push past him before he can finish. “I need to get upstairs.”

He calls out after me, but I’m already in the elevator, jabbing the button for the eleventh floor. Each second that ticks by feels like a countdown to something inevitable and awful. The door opens with a chime, and I step into the familiar buzz of the open-concept office. Phones ringing. Keyboards clacking.

And then I see him.

He’s sitting at **my desk**, typing away with an easy, practiced smile. He glances up casually, and for a second, my brain short-circuits. Because the man in my chair—the one joking with Jason from accounting, drinking from my coffee mug, and wearing my watch—**is me.**

No. Not exactly. He’s… better. His jawline is sharper, his skin is clearer, his clothes fit perfectly—not rumpled or wrinkled like mine. Even his hair, always a little limp no matter what I do, is thick and swept back like he just walked off a photoshoot. He’s me without the flaws.

Jason claps him on the shoulder with a grin. “Congrats again, man! That promotion’s long overdue.”

My stomach twists. **The promotion. My promotion.** The one I’d been grinding for—sacrificing weekends, working overtime, skipping dinners with Amber—just to prove I was good enough.

“Thanks, bro,” The imposter’s voice is smooth and warm—like mine, but without the hesitation, the doubt.

I step forward, my voice trembling with anger. “Hey! Get the fuck out of my chair.”

The room falls silent. Heads turn. Every eye in the office locks on me, and for a moment, nobody moves. Jason shifts uncomfortably. A few coworkers whisper to each other, casting uneasy glances in my direction.

The other me tilts his head and smiles—cool, calm, and collected. “Sorry… Do I know you?”

Something snaps inside me. I slam my hands down on the desk. “I **am** Daniel Clarke! That’s my desk, you fucking fraud!”

Jason steps in front of him, his expression tight with confusion—and just a little bit of fear. “Hey, buddy,” he says, his tone low and careful. “I don’t know who you are but you need to leave. Right now. Before we call security.”

I open my mouth to protest, but two guards are already behind me, hands clamping around my arms.

The pity on everyone’s faces as they watch me being hauled away burns like acid in my chest.

They drag me out, toss me into the cold rain, and slam the door shut behind me. I sit there for a moment on the slick pavement, stunned, the rain washing over me. People pass by without a glance—just another nobody on the street.

I dig through my pockets, fingers trembling, and pull out my wallet. My driver’s license is gone—replaced by a blank, plastic card. No name. No photo. No address. Just empty space where I used to exist.

I don’t go straight home.

For the next two hours, I wander the streets in the rain, my coat soaked through, searching for answers. I call my cell service provider from a payphone, but my number has already been transferred to a new device. My bank? Same story. A new password was set this morning, and they won’t tell me more without “proper ID.”

I try calling Amber. No answer. I dial twice more—straight to voicemail.

At first, I think I’ve been hacked. But nothing fits. **How did they get my face? My voice? My fucking memories?**

I head to the police station next, but as soon as I tell them someone’s stolen my life—and that person looks and sounds exactly like me—the officer at the desk gives me this look. **Like I’m unstable. Like I’m a problem.**

\_\_\_\_

When I finally circle back home, the door to the apartment won’t budge. My key isn’t on me, and the doormat where we keep a spare is empty. I bang on the door, calling for Amber, but she doesn’t answer.

I circle the building, drenched, heart racing. The fire escape on the side—our usual shortcut when we forget our keys—is still there. One of the windows is cracked open, just enough to squeeze through. I haul myself up, the metal ladder groaning under my weight. My wet clothes stick to the rust, but I don't care. I just need to get inside. I need to see Amber. She’ll know what’s going on. She *has* to.

I slide the window up and pull myself in, landing awkwardly on the hardwood.

As I reach the hallway leading to the bedroom, I hear it—a low, rhythmic groan. My pulse stutters. I creep forward, trying not to make a sound. The door to our bedroom is ajar, light spilling from the crack. I push it open with trembling fingers.

I know what I’m going to find before I see it.

The bedroom smells of sweat and exertion, a scent so thick I gag on it. My wife, Amber, lies sprawled across the bed, glowing with satisfaction. Her dark hair is a wild tangle against the pillows, and she’s breathing in short, happy gasps—the kind I haven’t heard from her in a long time.

At the foot of the bed, **he** kneels between her legs. My face. My body. My voice, murmuring something low and soft. He wipes his mouth, still hard, and grins when he sees me standing in the doorway. **He doesn’t even bother covering himself.**

Amber lets out a dazed, satisfied laugh. “Oh my God, Dan… That was… you’ve never done that before.” She shivers, her skin flushed and glowing. “What got into you?”

I step forward, trembling. “Amber…”

Her head snaps toward me, and the joy drains from her face, replaced by confusion—then fear. She pulls the sheet over her body like I’m a stranger who just broke in.

“Who the fuck are you?” she whispers, her voice sharp with panic.

My throat tightens. “It’s me… It’s Daniel! I’m your husband!”

Her eyes dart to the other me—the perfect me, the **better** me—and I see the moment her confusion dissolves into certainty. She presses herself closer to him, trembling. “Dan, call the police!”

He gets off the bed slowly, lazily, like he has all the time in the world. “It’s okay, babe,” he murmurs, brushing her hair from her face. “He’s just confused.” He turns to me, still smiling that infuriating, perfect smile. “But you need to leave now. This isn’t your life anymore.”

I stagger backward, heart hammering, the walls closing in around me. “No. No, you’re the fake. You’re the fucking fake!”

Amber sobs, burying her face in his chest. He wraps his arms around her, comforting her, **owning her**, and something inside me crumbles. She clings to him the way she hasn’t clung to me in years. Like he’s the man she’s always wanted—and maybe, deep down, **the man I could never be.**

1g5mirs,https://www.reddit.com/r/PageTurner627Horror/comments/1g5mirs/the_better_me/,The Better Me,"I wake up to the sound of rain tapping against the windows of the studio apartment in Portland I share with my wife Amber. Where everything smells faintly of coffee grounds and mildew. A sour tang lingers in the air—a scent I can’t place but makes my stomach turn. 

My phone lies dead next to me on the nightstand. Strange. I could've sworn I plugged in the charger last night. I sit up, rubbing the sleep from my eyes, and the ache in my muscles feels deeper than it should, like I’ve been lying in the same position for days. My clothes—yesterday’s clothes—cling to my skin with the stale odor of sweat, as if I’ve lived in them far too long. 

The clock reads 10:42 AM. 

I never sleep in this late on a weekday.

A cold sense of dread creeps in as I stagger out of bed. My car keys aren’t on the hook by the door. My laptop is missing from the desk.

I shuffle toward the kitchen, each step heavy, like my body’s forgotten how to move. As I round the corner, our dog, Baxter, stands in the middle of the room—stiff, tail low, hackles raised. His lips peel back, exposing teeth in a way I've never seen before.

“Bax? Hey, buddy…” My voice cracks.

He growls, low and guttural, like I’m someone he’s never met. His eyes—usually soft and eager—are wild now, tracking my every movement, a predator sizing me up.

“Come on, it’s me.” I take a cautious step forward, but he lunges, snapping the air just inches from my hand. I stumble back, heart hammering.

The worst part isn’t the aggression—it’s the look in his eyes. There’s no recognition. None. 

I barely manage to sidestep as Baxter snaps again, teeth clicking shut with a sharp *clack*. My heart races, and I grab the doorknob with trembling hands, wrenching it open just in time. I stumble out into the hallway, slamming the door behind me as his paws scrape furiously against the wood. 

When I get to the curb outside, my car is gone.

Panic hums under my skin as I jog through the wet streets toward my office building downtown. The rain clings to me like a second skin, but I barely feel it. My pulse hammers in my ears. Something’s wrong. Everything’s wrong.

At the office entrance, I swipe my badge. The little beep sounds, but the turnstile won’t budge. I try again, but nothing happens.

The security guard at the front desk eyes me. “Can I help you?” he asks, polite but wary.

“Yeah, I—” I clear my throat. “I work here. Daniel Clarke. Marketing.”

The guard frowns and types something into his computer. He squints at the screen, then back at me. “Says here Daniel Clarke already checked in. About thirty minutes ago.”

The room tilts. My heart skips a beat. “What?”

The guard looks concerned. 

“Look, man,” he says carefully, like he’s trying not to spook me. “You okay? You want me to call someone?”

I push past him before he can finish. “I need to get upstairs.”

He calls out after me, but I’m already in the elevator, jabbing the button for the eleventh floor. Each second that ticks by feels like a countdown to something inevitable and awful. The door opens with a chime, and I step into the familiar buzz of the open-concept office. Phones ringing. Keyboards clacking.

And then I see him.

He’s sitting at **my desk**, typing away with an easy, practiced smile. He glances up casually, and for a second, my brain short-circuits. Because the man in my chair—the one joking with Jason from accounting, drinking from my coffee mug, and wearing my watch—  
**is me.**

No. Not exactly. He’s… better. His jawline is sharper, his skin is clearer, his clothes fit perfectly—not rumpled or wrinkled like mine. Even his hair, always a little limp no matter what I do, is thick and swept back like he just walked off a photoshoot. He’s me without the flaws. 

Jason claps him on the shoulder with a grin. “Congrats again, man! That promotion’s long overdue.”

My stomach twists. **The promotion. My promotion.** The one I’d been grinding for—sacrificing weekends, working overtime, skipping dinners with Amber—just to prove I was good enough.

“Thanks, bro,” The imposter’s voice is smooth and warm—like mine, but without the hesitation, the doubt.

I step forward, my voice trembling with anger. “Hey! Get the fuck out of my chair.”

The room falls silent. Heads turn. Every eye in the office locks on me, and for a moment, nobody moves. Jason shifts uncomfortably. A few coworkers whisper to each other, casting uneasy glances in my direction.

The other me tilts his head and smiles—cool, calm, and collected. “Sorry… Do I know you?”

Something snaps inside me. I slam my hands down on the desk. “I **am** Daniel Clarke! That’s my desk, you fucking fraud!”

Jason steps in front of him, his expression tight with confusion—and just a little bit of fear. “Hey, buddy,” he says, his tone low and careful. “I don’t know who you are but you need to leave. Right now. Before we call security.”

I open my mouth to protest, but two guards are already behind me, hands clamping around my arms. 

The pity on everyone’s faces as they watch me being hauled away burns like acid in my chest.

They drag me out, toss me into the cold rain, and slam the door shut behind me. I sit there for a moment on the slick pavement, stunned, the rain washing over me. People pass by without a glance—just another nobody on the street. 

I dig through my pockets, fingers trembling, and pull out my wallet. My driver’s license is gone—replaced by a blank, plastic card. No name. No photo. No address. Just empty space where I used to exist.

I don’t go straight home.

For the next two hours, I wander the streets in the rain, my coat soaked through, searching for answers. I call my cell service provider from a payphone, but my number has already been transferred to a new device. My bank? Same story. A new password was set this morning, and they won’t tell me more without “proper ID.”

I try calling Amber. No answer. I dial twice more—straight to voicemail.

At first, I think I’ve been hacked. But nothing fits. **How did they get my face? My voice? My fucking memories?**

I head to the police station next, but as soon as I tell them someone’s stolen my life—and that person looks and sounds exactly like me—the officer at the desk gives me this look. **Like I’m unstable. Like I’m a problem.**

\_\_\_\_

When I finally circle back home, the door to the apartment won’t budge. My key isn’t on me, and the doormat where we keep a spare is empty. I bang on the door, calling for Amber, but she doesn’t answer. 

I circle the building, drenched, heart racing. The fire escape on the side—our usual shortcut when we forget our keys—is still there. One of the windows is cracked open, just enough to squeeze through. I haul myself up, the metal ladder groaning under my weight. My wet clothes stick to the rust, but I don't care. I just need to get inside. I need to see Amber. She’ll know what’s going on. She *has* to.

I slide the window up and pull myself in, landing awkwardly on the hardwood. 

As I reach the hallway leading to the bedroom, I hear it—a low, rhythmic groan. My pulse stutters. I creep forward, trying not to make a sound. The door to our bedroom is ajar, light spilling from the crack. I push it open with trembling fingers.

I know what I’m going to find before I see it.

The bedroom smells of sweat and exertion, a scent so thick I gag on it. My wife, Amber, lies sprawled across the bed, glowing with satisfaction. Her dark hair is a wild tangle against the pillows, and she’s breathing in short, happy gasps—the kind I haven’t heard from her in a long time.

At the foot of the bed, **he** kneels between her legs. My face. My body. My voice, murmuring something low and soft. He wipes his mouth, still hard, and grins when he sees me standing in the doorway. **He doesn’t even bother covering himself.**

Amber lets out a dazed, satisfied laugh. “Oh my God, Dan… That was… you’ve never done that before.” She shivers, her skin flushed and glowing. “What got into you?”

I step forward, trembling. “Amber…”

Her head snaps toward me, and the joy drains from her face, replaced by confusion—then fear. She pulls the sheet over her body like I’m a stranger who just broke in.

“Who the fuck are you?” she whispers, her voice sharp with panic.

My throat tightens. “It’s me… It’s Daniel! I’m your husband!”

Her eyes dart to the other me—the perfect me, the **better** me—and I see the moment her confusion dissolves into certainty. She presses herself closer to him, trembling. “Dan, call the police!”

He gets off the bed slowly, lazily, like he has all the time in the world. “It’s okay, babe,” he murmurs, brushing her hair from her face. “He’s just confused.” He turns to me, still smiling that infuriating, perfect smile. “But you need to leave now. This isn’t your life anymore.”

I stagger backward, heart hammering, the walls closing in around me. “No. No, you’re the fake. You’re the fucking fake!”

Amber sobs, burying her face in his chest. He wraps his arms around her, comforting her, **owning her**, and something inside me crumbles. She clings to him the way she hasn’t clung to me in years. Like he’s the man she’s always wanted—and maybe, deep down, **the man I could never be.**

I turn slowly, my legs heavy, each step pulling me further away from everything I thought I knew. The rain greets me again as I step out into the street, cold and relentless, washing over me like a final, indifferent goodbye.

I feel like I’m falling, spinning, untethered from reality. Maybe I’m the fake. Maybe I’ve always been.

Or worse—maybe I just never deserved this life to begin with.

I mean, we’re not all about loud parties or, at the other end, quiet cafes, right? Some of us thrive in the middle, depending on the vibe, the person, or even the day of the week, because hey, adulting, am I right?

After digging into this, I realized that finding the right date idea can make or break the entire experience—especially if you’re an introvert, extrovert, or even somewhere in between. So, here goes.

**For Introverts**: think cozy, low-pressure activities. For me, one of the best options is a quiet. fairly empty coffee shop or a library date (think TBBT). You can sit in silence while spending time with each other. A spin on this is a bookstore coffee shop date. They might not be as ubiquitous though. Here, you can bond over favorite books, or just sip on your drinks while chatting in a calm setting. 

Another simple idea for an outdoorsy date is simply going for a walk. Even better if you can manage a scenic walk—nature vibes, fresh air, and no need for small talk if you’re still warming up to each other. It gives you space to connect without feeling overwhelmed.

**For Extroverts**: Now for the complete social butterflies. I'm guessing you crave more energy on your dates. Extroverts tend to thrive in lively settings, so why not hit up a trivia night, a group event (think karaoke), or even just a fun bar with music? 

I’ve also found that doing something active, like bowling or mini-golf, helps break the ice without feeling too formal. It’s all about the fun and the laughter with you extroverts—keeping things lively and full of interaction.

**For Ambiverts, the people in-between**: This is where it gets interesting because some of us (myself included) can swing between introverted and extroverted depending on the day. So, balance is key. Dinner at a cool restaurant with a relaxed but social atmosphere works great—it’s structured but still leaves room for meaningful conversation. 

Or maybe even a museum or art gallery date, where you can chat, enjoy the exhibits, and have the option to wander off for some quiet time if needed.

In the end, the most important thing is finding a date idea that fits everyone's comfort zones. If you can actually find a way to cater to each other’s vibe, it can really elevate the whole experience and make it way more fun and relaxed. Plus, knowing your personality type (and theirs, hopefully) can help you create a more memorable, enjoyable date.

1g5mb2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1g5mb2c/succes_on_6_months_keto/,Succes on 6 months Keto! ,"I can finally say, for the first time in my life, that I’m no longer on a diet. I have actually adapted to a different lifestyle and it gave me so much! 

When I was struggling or had questions this subreddit gave me a boost so hopefully this post will do that for someone else. 

(Most reddit posts are in US scales so did my best converting online) 
In total I (F, 30 y.o. 6 ft) have lost 34 pounds. I have been stable for a month or so but my body is still slimming down (fat vs muscle). Went from size 14 to 6/8. 

The very best thing: 
Since wanting to become a mother I found out I have a hormonal imbalance (PCOS) and a slow thyroid. Today I received the news that just by going keto, no medications, I have completely turned this around! PCOS symptoms have disappeared and thyroid is fully back to normal. 

My whole life I’ve been in the cycle of being quite slim to chubby/overweight and back again and nothing ever lasted long. 
Diets were always a temporary fix and agonizingly difficult to keep up. 

I’d never think I would feel this way but Keto lifestyle has now become completely effortless for me and I’m not at all thinking about/ bothered by foods I shouldn’t eat. 

Some things/tips I learned along the way: 

*Keep it simple  
In general: Use whole foods and DO NOT buy any keto/low carb products.   
When you’re starting out: this also goes for almond flour, coconut flour, sugar free syrup etc etc.  
This will only delay your progress and you should learn to eat differently instead of expecting there to be a substitute for all items you ‘can’t’ have.  
*Don’t overcomplicate things  
This is a personal decision but I don’t believe in all the apps, tracking your macros with every bite. For me it’s an unnecessary headache (Unless of course you’re not seeing any progress and have absolutely no idea why). 
All products have ingredients and nutritional values on the back and common sense tells you which whole foods you should use.  
*Don’t force-feed yourself high fat products  
Listen to your body and just eat when you’re hungry. If you normally wouldn’t put cream in your coffee then don’t now.  
*Cauliflower rice, love it!  
Even my husband, who’s not on Keto and needs more food than me, loves cauliflower rice. Many recipes out there to combine it with and great way to add more food and veg.  
*Ottolenghi  
Love this cuisine and has many usable recipes.
Especially nice for dinner parties.  
*Work out and distract yourself   
In stead of scrolling through the endless stream of insta food videos with your ass on the sofa get your endorphins going or go for a walk outside. You’ll thank me later  
*Don’t go nuts for nuts  
It’s very easy to go from a small handful to a whole bag of almonds. From experience I can say this definitely delays your progress.  
*Reward yourself  
When you haven’t reached your ‘endgoal’ yet it’s still important to acknowledge all little milestones on the way. 
The better you feel about yourself the easier it becomes. Buy a new piece of clothing or something nice for the house, get your hair done, plan a fun outing etc.  
*Focus on short term in the beginning  
I wrote down my weight per week en left the next 2 weeks open (so date, no weight). It gave me a boost/motivation to go to the next ‘small’ step which leads to overall long term results.     
*Tell people you’re doing this  
In my experience friends and family never take it too seriously in the beginning. Unbeknownst to them they try to sway you to give it up for a minute and eat what they made, join the party etc. The sooner you tell them the sooner they’re 100% supportive.

She has said before she is a scatter brain and needs to be reminded sometimes, as in, I need to be more pro-active. Is this a shit-test and should I remind her last-minute, or just let it go and leave?

Don't let the following long story distract you from the actual point above. Just for the full picture:

I'll start by saying I probably know the answer to my question, but happy to hear some insights/perspective.

I'm trying to meet up with a woman, an old crush. She has always kept tabs on me in a way, despite having a boyfriend, so somehow there was some interest, but it was more of a one-way street, so I pulled out. Having thought about it though, she seemed cool and I don't mind staying in touch.

Some time ago I said, 'let me know when you're up for a coffee sometime', and after a while, she did. We met up, it was a good catchup and afterwards she suggested we should get some pizza and a beer some night.

She is on a 6wk on, 2 wk off work schedule, and quite some distance outside of town, so she's not around a lot, and I figured I wait for her to contact me when she'd be in town again. However, that seemed a bit daft and since I'm the one leaving for a while now, I asked her to meet up. She seemed enthusiastic enough, but here it comes:

*She said: let me know when you'll leave and I'll check my schedule to see what works.*  
*I misheard that, and tried to offer a few suggestions, almost like thinking out loud, sending multiple messages and coming across as overeager.*

Then it was silence after that. Kinda textbook scared her off it looks like. It has been a week and I'm leaving this saturday, so not much time left. I'm actually ok with not meeting, as it honestly is getting kinda pointless, and her not replying is a rather rude. 

However, how does this work? She was happy to meet up, and then suddenly stops replying, only because of a few extra messages on my side? Is this something of a shit-test? She has said in the past she is pretty scatter-brained, but surely, that is a bit BS as if she really wanted to, she would have remembered to reply right? She had remembered I asked her to meet up for coffee for a long time.

Is this the illusion of action now? Should I remind her in case she just 'forgot'? Either a quick text or just a funny meme to seem a bit aloof and not to eager. Somehow, just leaving and not saying anything seems a bit...passive aggressive? She has very clearly said or asked me in the past, that I should remind her more, but, you know, it is a 2 way street right?",1,1729154473.0,CoachCoreyWayne,0,1.0,False

Empathy, honesty, and real talk are my thing. I appreciate conversations where both sides feel understood.

Music is my life’s soundtrack—I'm into everything from In Flames and Blink-182 to Breathe Carolina and Our Last Night. Lyrics are the subtitles to my experiences.

I love deep conversations about life, emotions, and what makes people tick.

I enjoy shows and movies with dark humor and intensity, like Loudermilk, Evil, and Shaun of the Dead.

I’m fascinated by psychology and human behavior, always seeking new insights.

Nature provides moments of peace and reflection, even if I don’t get outdoors often.

Team Pepsi (Dr Pepper’s my favorite), I love tea, hardly drink coffee, I’m team Star Trek, neither Democrat nor Republican, and I prefer Twizzlers over Red Vines. Now we’ve covered potential disagreements!

I know I booked them last week at the latest. I could remember both plans but for the life of me I didn’t connect the dots between the 2 plans. 

I got the vaccine shot yesterday afternoon and I’ve been so tired since. My body is aching, I’m super dehydrated, major headache and the arm in question is so sore. I woke up at 7 this morning, took my meds and then immediately fell back to sleep til 7:40. Not to mention this has completely thrown off our morning routine. 

Our plans for this weekend include a LOT of walking around London. Saturday will be a touristy day, walking around central London, going to Buckingham palace and thru the park near the palace. Sunday we plan to walk around the park near us, grab a cup of coffee and end it with a Sunday roast at a nearby Calvary. 

Not to mention that it will be the my husband, our 21m toddler and myself. I’m exhausted, and both my 21m daughter and husband aren’t exactly feeling 100% either. I made the touristy plans cuz my sister’s lived in the US most of her life but she’s currently visiting friends in Europe. So I figured it would be nice to see some of London.

My husband and I have agreed we can’t cancel our plans at this point cuz my sister and her husband have booked their flights and accommodation for the weekend (she’s super organized).

I'm not sure if there's even better steamed milk possible, but I've been getting nothing but great results with it since I learned steaming the milk. Took a few tries and now it's wonderful. I do not get the shaving foam-like foam you might get from an automatic steamer or one of those units with the spinny thing, but as far as I'm concerned that's a good thing, I want my foam to be drinkable, and not have to use a spoon to get it out. Pretty sure I'm not overheating my milk either. 

But now I'm wondering, what is possible with a more powerful steam wand. Do you get stiffer foam? Or does it go quicker? 

As far as the coffee goes: the GCP might be not the most ideal choice, but I'm glad I went with it, I let it warm up for 15-20 min and make one cup of cappuccino. I like the idea of it being super repairable and made for long term use. The coffee from it is better than any fully automatic espresso machine I've tried so far, and that was the goal.

I took it once in the morning but I still coughed a bit at night, so she told me to take it at night too. My symptoms went away. These last few days I've been lazy about taking my additional 20mg dosage at night, and I realize now I'm starting to cough again. 

Am I just doomed to take Omeprazole forever? I've been eating healthy and low acid, I have a pillow to prop up my head, I've not been drinking coffee or alcohol. Is this just my life now? I just take ppis until I die? ",1,1729153132.0,LPR,1,1.0,False

A little time ago I started to see some weird stuff between him and a female coworker. After many weird things he has been doing I decided to ask him if what is going on and of course he said nothing, he got very defensive and offended, he also said that in a relationship you must hide some stuff and don’t be completely honest. Which was my confirmation that I am right. I have to mention that I have seen enough things that don’t put him in the position of a loyal man. 

One of the things I have noticed among others was the car chair. The day before I was the last person that stood in the passenger seat and the next day he got to work and right after work he waited me to go for a coffee together and the chair was pulled back, very much and and leaned quite a lot back.. he said nobody got into the car that day. But if I was the last person who sat on the chair why was it completely changed. I also found out that he was going out during the working hours, with his work buddies and probably those women out, he put 15 kilos because of that .. the kilos are a good karma plus he is loosing a lot of hair, so much that he is thinking about hair implant, but he doesn’t has money to pay it. I realised all this relationship was a lie, the only thing he did was to lie and do his life while pretending he is in love, because friends and family sees him like the perfect boyfriend.

Anyway, after a lot of thinking I took the decision to leave him. I talked to a therapist, she said she thinks he is not cheating, but my gut is telling me otherwise. I have chronic anxiety and panic attacks and two years ago I started to suffer by gut inflammation, which is very painful.

I haven’t told him that I am preparing my leave. Why I am still with him? because I want to move to another country and it is not that easy to leave right away. It is very hard for me to pretend that nothing is going on, I am completely disgusted by him, I know every word  from him is another lie.. it is hard, but I try to think about the time when I will leave. It will be in a few months. 

I can tell he is sensing something, because after so many years he asked me to marry and I keep giving stupid reasons to pospone it. I know he must have some dark motive behind it.

Anyway now the only think I dream with is of the moment when I will break free and change my life. My therapist say to go out and start dating in the mean time, not serious but for fun, I also think would make me good, but I don’t want to risk to be catch and then he will look like the good guy and I am not in the mood. ",1,1729152703.0,BreakupBackup,0,1.0,False
