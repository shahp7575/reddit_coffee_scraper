1fv18sf,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1fv18sf/sour_astringent_or_empty_bitter_looking_for/,Sour & astringent or empty & bitter - Looking for troubleshooting advice,"So I've been following Hoffman's better 1 cup v60 and I'm getting quite mixed results. I've been trying to be pretty scientific about this, keeping notes of what I change per brew, etc and I'm just not getting the same level cups I'd get at a (good) coffee shop. I've been doing this for quite a while now and I often find it's taking me a whole 250g bag of beans before I can finally get something decent and I still feel that I'm putting up with more below average cups than I should be.

My general process is to start with 100C for water and to pick a grind setting that I think should work; going finer or coarser depending on if the cup turns out sour/bitter. If going too far outside of the grind chart params I'll consider lowering water temperature and repeating the process.

On average I feel my cups often trend towards being sour with an astringent/dry taste. Usually quite hard for me to get something bitter. When they do become bitter however, it's very much accompanied by an ""empty flavour"".

One thing I am questioning at this point is the starting at 100C rather than say 93C or something like that. Hoffman's recipe makes a note of 'the hotter, the better' but I'm curious about others' experience..

**Current set up:**

* Ceramic V60 (was using plastic in the past but trying to keep away from plastic if I can).
* 1zpresso X Pro grinder
* Brew water made up with TWW packets & distilled water (discovered my tap water is shit for whatever reason)
* Fellow gooseneck kettle
* Various beans from Market Lane and Code Black Coffee Roasters (both in Melbourne) - all of which should be light roasted.

I'm using 15g coffee, 250g water and I'm preheating my brewer with boiling water)  
For example my recent notes from today look like this;

(smaller number = finer on my grinder )

**100C - 1.4.0** - Empty tasting, slight bitter-sweetness?

**100C - 1.50**. - Pretty much the exact same

**100C - 2.10** - Far less empty,  slightly sweet, degree of sourness & astringency.

*While I'm a bit finer than what the chart recommends, in the past I've found that pretty much anything past 2.2.0 is way too sour.*

1fv17mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Machines/comments/1fv17mr/best_single_cup_coffee_maker_with_builtin_grinder/,Best Single Cup Coffee Maker with Built-In Grinder,"I was bouncing between different single-cup coffee makers, trying to find that perfect balance of convenience and flavor. I love freshly ground coffee, but I also wanted the ease of a single-serve machine—because let’s face it, some mornings you just don’t have time to fuss with multiple gadgets. After some serious research (and a few too many early mornings with sub-par brews), I finally narrowed it down to two standout options that combine single-cup brewing with built-in grinders. Here’s what I found:

**1. Breville The Grind Control Coffee Maker**

*highlight: brew single servings or a full pot (up to 12 cups)*

This one was a game-changer for me. Right off the bat, the LCD screen makes customization super easy—whether you’re brewing a single cup or a full pot, you can control the grind size and brew strength with just a few clicks. What I love most is that it uses a **burr grinder**, which is key for getting a consistent grind and, ultimately, a better-tasting cup. I noticed that the coffee came out smooth and flavorful, without any of that bitterness you can sometimes get when the grind is uneven.

Another huge plus? The gold filter. It’s reusable, which means no more paper filters, and cleaning the machine is surprisingly straightforward. I was also impressed by how quick the grinding and brewing process was, with no stray coffee grounds left behind in my cup. That said, it’s definitely on the bulkier side, so if you have limited counter space, that’s something to consider. And yes, it’s pricier than other models, but if you’re after flavor and ease of use, it’s worth the investment.

**2. Cuisinart Coffee Center Grind & Brew Plus**

*highlight: brew both a single cup and a full 12-cup pot*

If you’re looking for something a bit more compact and budget-friendly, this is a fantastic option. The design is much smaller than the Breville, and it’s super straightforward to use. You can grind the beans directly into a **reusable K-Cup pod**, which is really convenient for a quick cup without sacrificing freshness. Plus, if you’re ever in a rush or feeling lazy, it also works with disposable K-Cups.

However, this one uses a **blade grinder** instead of a burr grinder. While blade grinders get the job done, I found that the grind wasn’t as consistent, which sometimes led to a slightly less flavorful brew compared to the Breville. But if you’re more about convenience than perfection, this could be a non-issue for you.

# What to Consider When Choosing a Single-Cup Coffee Maker with a Built-In Grinder:

* **Grinder Type**: Burr grinders, like the one in the Breville, tend to produce a more even grind, which means better coffee extraction and flavor. Blade grinders, like in the Cuisinart, are faster and more compact but can lead to uneven grounds.
* **Brewing Time**: The Breville brews a full pot in about 6 minutes, which is great for those busy mornings. The Cuisinart takes a bit longer, around 9 minutes for a full pot, though that’s less of an issue if you’re brewing single cups.
* **Size and Space**: The Breville is definitely bulkier, which might not work for smaller kitchens. The Cuisinart is more compact, but keep in mind it only brews one cup at a time.

**A Few Other Considerations:**

While I ultimately settled on these two machines, I also came across some other interesting options for single-cup brewing:

* **Moccamaster Cup One**: This one doesn’t have a built-in grinder, but paired with a good grinder like the **Baratza Encore**, it delivers excellent results. It’s a bit of an investment to get the grinder and brewer separately, but you get total control over the brewing process, and the flavor is fantastic.
* **Technivorm 59691**: Another solid option for those who want to customize their brewing experience with a separate grinder. It’s renowned for its consistency and quality.
* **Spinn Coffee Maker**: While I didn’t personally try this one, it caught my attention for its unique centrifuge brewing technology. It’s definitely on the pricier side, but if you’re into experimenting with different brewing methods like espresso and pour-over, it’s worth a look.

Overall, both the Breville and Cuisinart hit that sweet spot of grinding fresh beans right before brewing, which makes a noticeable difference in taste. If you want the best of both worlds—single-cup convenience and freshly ground coffee—these are excellent options to considerI",1,1727935797.0,Coffee_Machines,0,1.0,False

1fv16t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1fv16t2/i_actually_really_like_the_t92_filters/,I actually really like the T-92 filters,"I have always used whatever Hario filters were available to me for my V60 and haven't tried any other brands. I recently restocked and decided to try some Cafec filters and was surprised to discover that they have like 6 or 8 different styles of filter. So, I did what I usually do and spent way too long on Reddit, Youtube, and coffee blogs trying to figure out which ones to get. From that, I concluded that the very strong and universal opinion is that the best Cafec filters are the Abaca and the T-90s and that the T-92s are the worst filters ever invented. So, I decided to order both the Abacas and the T-92s and see for myself.



Briefly, here is my setup:

Plastic V60 01

1zpresso ZP6 zeroed, usually grinding at 3.5-4.5

Beans are typically ultra-light Nordic-style coffees from Wendelboe, Pala, Sey, etc.

200 mL (such as the Rogue Wave recipe)



My first impression is that these filters are quite different. There is a full 1 minute difference in brew time between the two. I typically brew 200 mL in the V60 01 using either Hoffman's 1-cup  method, the Rogue Wave 200 mL recipe, or the Kurasu 200 mL recipe. With any of these recipes, the Abacas finish within 2 minutes whereas the T-92s take at least 3 minutes.



I know the main reason people love the Abacas and the T-90s is that they are super fast, which I can confirm. However, I found this to be mostly a liability in my setup. My grinder is the ZP6, which, in my experience, produces very few fines. Combined with the small brew sizes (12-13g/200mL), this means that I can hardly keep water on the grounds before it drains out. For example, using Hoffman's 1-cup method the water drains out completely between each 10s pulse. I can keep grinding finer, but I don't find I am getting more vibrant cups, it just kind of tastes hollow and muddy. By contrast, the T-92s are really nice because it allows the water to stay in contact with the grounds a bit longer. This allows me to grind a bit coarser while still getting really beautiful, vibrant cups. This also means I get much higher clarity with the T-92s. 



From this experience, I am not concluding that one or the other is better or worse, I just think that which works well depends on your equipment, your taste preferences, and how you dial it in. I think if you are brewing larger amounts (500 mL) or have a grinder that produces a lot of fines or if you prefer a more full-bodied cup, the faster filters will likely work better for you. On the other hand, if you have a really consistent grinder or you're brewing small quantities or if you like a really clean cup then the T-92 might work well for you. I also suspect that for immersion brewers like the Switch the faster filters will work better, for obvious reasons. Lastly, I think comparing these filters side-by-side is difficult because they thrive under different conditions. If you have it dialed in for one of them, it is going to taste worse for the other and vice versa.



Just wanted to get one data point on the web for a positive use-case for the T-92s. Cheers!",2,1727935698.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

“Appetizer” started very soon after takeoff with these breadsticks with sesame. They were pretty good, although my only complaint would be that sesame is a common allergy (at least in the US) and this was handed to everyone, but it was a nice alternative to pretzels 🥨 7/10

Dinner - I was so pleasantly surprised with the dinner meal. I really didn’t know what to expect. Main course was tofu with rice and vegetables. This was served with a side salad, some fruit, and, you guessed it, a dinner roll. Let’s start with the salad. It was small and good, but there was no dressing?? lol. I honestly really didn’t mind because it was so small anyhow and I munched on it anyway. Main course was so good!! Again not a ton of dressing or flavoring (no sauce) but I honestly really did not mind at all. I’m a huge tofu fan and love to see it! It was a bit ricey, butttttt I really enjoyed it. Vegetables included broccoli 🥦, peppers 🫑, and baby corn 🌽 Fruit plate, self explanatory and yummy! Fruits included cantaloupe, 1 grape, honeydew, and pineapple. The dinner roll was a bit standard, I tried it with the vegan butter and I was pleasantly surprised, it really did taste like butter. They offered coffee or tea after dinner which is what the small mug is for but I did not take any. Dinner 8/10

Breakfast - the first thing I noticed when my breakfast came out was how hot it was (good thing)! The vegan option was a warm veggie sandwich, vegetables including some lettuce, pepper, eggplant, and zucchini on some bread. I was very pleasantly surprised by this. Again not a ton of flavoring but I really didn’t mind. The bread was so melt in your mouth!! I’ve never had bread like that it was really good 8/10.

Drink review - I got water 💧 and coffee ☕️  water is water but in terms of the coffee, it was pretty good, I know Austria is known for their coffee, again, this is a plane too so keep that in mind. 

Another note for anyone interested is that Austrian offers free alcohol for all passengers, even economy. I don’t drink so I can’t say and not sure the exact type of alcohol(s) but it did see a lot of people order the Austrian wine which was pretty cool. 

Overall score - 8/10 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/⭐️⭐️

I’ve always been an excellent student, usually at the top of my class. I graduated high school with great grades. After graduating, I moved back to my home country to study medicine, which added to the challenges. 

From the very start, I noticed that the amount of studying in med school is way more than what I was used to. There’s also an overwhelming number of exams ( almost weekly ) . The first two years were tough, especially during finals when I’d stay up all night, using coffee and paracetamol to get through it. Despite the exhaustion, I managed to get good grades, but I always felt like I was just barely handling it.

During my 3rd and 4th years, it’s been a completely different experience. I’ve lost almost all passion for studying. I feel tired every time I open a book, and even when I try to study, I struggle to understand anything. My memory has gotten worse, and it’s like I’ve hit a mental block. My grades have also dropped, not drastically, but they’re nowhere near where they used to be, and it’s frustrating.

On top of med school, I’m also trying to study for board exams and learn a second language because I want to pursue my career abroad. However, I’ve been finding it impossible to balance everything. Learning a language alone feels overwhelming for me, and I always think I’ll never succeed (maybe because I don’t speak with native speakers). So, how can I manage it alongside everything else that’s already overwhelming?

The pressure is also coming from my family and friends. They still see me as someone who’s hardworking and successful, and that adds even more stress. I’ve always been introverted, but lately, it’s gotten worse. I barely socialize anymore, going from home to uni and back. It’s not just because of my academic workload—I’ve started feeling like I don’t want to deal with people at all. I feel more comfortable alone, but at the same time, I worry that this isolation will hurt me in the future.

In my country, med school is 5 years followed by 2 years of internship, where you finally get hands-on experience with patients. But here’s another issue: during the internship, you’re expected to seek out learning opportunities on your own. The doctors won’t necessarily teach you unless you ask for guidance. As an introvert, the idea of being proactive and constantly approaching doctors for help feels daunting, and I’m really anxious about how I’ll manage during this phase of my training.

With all these thoughts constantly running through my head, I can’t stop questioning whether I’ve chosen the right path. I feel like I’m not going to succeed in the future, and the self-doubt is eating away at me.

rationally, yes, I know the answer to this.. probably, but I really wanna know what others have to say.

i'm 14F and have struggled with ED thoughts since around age 12, never acted on it much, restricted here and there (like 3-ish days at most), then would snap out of it and completely stop and go back to eating whenever I wanted whatever I wanted. at the start of Feb this year I began struggling with body image and body dysmorphia, I have been on the underweight side for the past few years. as an estimate really. last time I weighed myself was right before new years putting me at a BMI of>!16!<this was prior to *any* restricted habits. no, seriously, I ate a lot. especially now that I know more about calories, but I really believe this is genetics \[hopefully not a medical condition, I was also born a preemie for reference\] everyone in my family has a hard time gaining weight - specifically the females. however, at the start of Feb I *believe* I started gaining weight. I'm not sure - because I didn't have access to a scale. was just judging off of my eyes.

anywho, this led to restricted eating habits from Feb to the end of April was intaking >!500 calories a day, briefly more when forced, but no more than 2k.!< at the end of April I went to the doctors because I couldn't sleep due to heart palpitations. that ended up not being the focus as I had a very, very worrying BMI of >!12.6!< my mom wasn't aware of my weight or eating habits until the doctors - I wore baggy clothes with multiple layers 24/7 (was cold all the time, no surprise in that) why I was not hospitalized then and there by the doctors? dunno. but after my mom found out and I told her the full truth it led to a half assed recovery.

so between April and July I ""reverse dieted"" up to >!1200 (with some exercise playing a part)!<I was home this entire time by the way - no inpatient, no therapist, no dietitian, and I entirely believe this is simply just bad luck for my situation on that part. my family is very, very broke. we don't have enough money for any of those things, nor am I positive insurance would cover it. however my family has probably been my biggest support. its no surprise I didn't even gain >!1lbs!<doing this. and remained at the same BMI. start of August I started eating more (around >!1.6k-1.8k with intense, intense exercise playing part!<) then one week later, ONE week, I got so tired and eventually gave up on this all and I had been wanting to commit to recovery for awhile now, like seriously, I hated actively being in my ED, because it was *no longer safe* to me. I felt nothing but disgust for doing this to myself. so I made a (now deleted) post here and got some advice!

I started eating >!2.5k!< immediately - I did not consider refeeding syndrome, as my calorie intake had been above >!1k!<but looking back I didn't factor in my weight could play a part, too. I don't think I got refeeding syndrome, I don't remember feeling any of the symptoms listed. I don't exactly know if I got EH, id be mentally and physically satisfied (or well, not starving anymore at least) after eating >!2.5k!<usually. like, that's what I was genuinely hungry for. I did this for about a week - and worked on stopped counting calories a little - i.e, I drank coffee with unmeasured amounts of creamer/milk and sugar (yay!) sorta like harm reduction, still counted, but was tryna reduce it. in the 1st week I was a *bottomless pit.* like literally u could throw anything in me and id feel empty. I did NOT bloat - of course, I ate till I wasn't hungry, but I did not feel full FULL. it was like a half empty glass. followed by this was really really bad physical hunger, my hunger cues never went away during restriction, in fact I think they were MORE prominent in restriction vs before I ever restricted. my stomach was growling every single day constantly even into refeeding. I couldn't last 30 minutes after eating before my stomach was growling again. of course, parents assured me this was normal (they do have some knowledge on this), and that i'm gonna have to eat a lot to fix my body - and i'm gonna have to eat probably more than usual.

2nd week came and.. I don't know if it was because of my food intake, but I started getting really bad acid reflux that was NOT there during my ED, prior to my ED, or just 1 week ago. I was throwing up (not intentionally, I never suffered with purging neither) but I wasn't throwing up.. food. I was throwing up pure stomach acid. my mom has acid reflux problems, so I kinda linked it to that, but this led to me having to down my intake a little to about >!1.8k-2.3k!<I know I probably should've pushed through, but this acid reflux thing was happening into the end of the 3rd week. I didn't know what to do.

in September it kinda tumbled a little from there. I ate >!1.6k-2.3k!<id say most of the time, more often then not being in the >!1.6k-1.9k!<range. some slip ups have made me go as low as >!1.2k!<however, that was only once. it ranged differently literally everyday, but I was still counting pretty obsessively. on Oct 1st, I had a doctors appointment for a check-up, since I haven't seen them since April. I thought for sure my weight was gonna put me atleast at a BMI of>!15!<and was in fact almost positive because I felt the same as when I had a BMI around that number, and felt I looked the same. well.. turns out i'm currently sitting at a BMI of >!13.5!<. I heard weight gain was pretty rapid in recovery, and for me to be eating fairly close to >!2k!<like, everyday, im confused on why I only put on >!5lbs!<in the spam of 50 days. and regarding my weight it should BE easier for me to gain weight? my TDEE would be low? i'm not really active. I have a habit of getting into my imagination a lot (thinking of stories/scenarios, unrelated to the ED by the way) but the way I sorta get into thinking of story lines, plots, stuff like that that i'm interested in, I pace back and forth because it gets my mind going easier. just in my room. or I do it when I listen to music because again, I like to think of stories that match the lyrics in a way. this was something I did way, way before my ED, like im talking when I was in elementary. this was something I did a year ago too, before restricted eating came into play.

the doctors are *somewhat* aware of my ED, my mom just briefly mentioned it. but they're looking at me funny, if u know what I mean. I mean yes, they were happy I gained the weight I did and didn't lose. but they hadn't seen me in about 5 months.. that'd be an estimate of >!1lbs!<a MONTH. I have been TRYING to get my thyroid tested too, but they can't get enough blood from me. I'm gonna be going in for the 3rd time specifically for blood tests soon, because the last 2 they failed. they said my veins were very deep in my skin & small (note: I DO bleed. they CAN get blood from me, but they struggle finding the vein, and often stick me multiple, multiple times). my question sorta comes down to what the hell do I do? I am trying to get better - I don't wanna be counting calories anymore, I don't wanna look the way I do anymore, I don't FEEL like myself like this. I've made the excuse that i'm taking a ""slower approach"" I guess but it doesn't seem to be working. I genuinely still feel trapped and I don't wanna deal with this when i'm a healthy weight. another thing, my family doesn't eat a lot. I've already mentioned the number I usually eat at, however, eating at that number i'm eating more then my older brother (who works a very physical job), my dad (who also works a very physical job & is a pretty big man), and my mom (who is a stay at home mom). my ED brain is very obsessive with comparing my intake so almost everyday I keep a mental note of who's ate what and listen far too closely that should be considered normal. again, not much money, so maybe it makes sense that they don't eat a lot, but how am I supposed to eat more when I already feel ashamed eating more then all of them right now? I *know* they're not recovering from an ED, but I still cant justify it, like at all in my head. I just feel guilty and ashamed. my parents gave me advice to just try to snack a little more to help weight gain, and I suggested controlling my portions to ensure weight gain, but they said they weren't going to do that, and for me to just eat whenever I want & whatever I want. but that's so, so hard when its a mental block between doing that. they acknowledge how much I eat and say that I eat a good amount too (not as in ""don't eat more then you are now!"" they encourage me too, like I mentioned a second ago, but its as in ""you don't under-eat now."") I don't fully trust myself to be able to recover, so I don't know what to do. I feel like nobody is gonna have any advice haha, this is a really tough situation honestly, which is why i'm stuck.

this feels weird to post so I might delete it haha, sorry. im very much not used to this so my apologies and I understand if nobody really has advice, u know? 😓 its sorta like a rant. I get bad anxiety posting online for some reason?? if mods need to take this down u can.",2,1727934209.0,fuckeatingdisorders,1,1.0,False

I’ve always been an excellent student, usually at the top of my class. I graduated high school with great grades. After graduating, I moved back to my home country to study medicine, which added to the challenges. 

From the very start, I noticed that the amount of studying in med school is way more than what I was used to. There’s also an overwhelming number of exams ( almost weekly ) . The first two years were tough, especially during finals when I’d stay up all night, using coffee and paracetamol to get through it. Despite the exhaustion, I managed to get good grades, but I always felt like I was just barely handling it.

During my 3rd and 4th years, it’s been a completely different experience. I’ve lost almost all passion for studying. I feel tired every time I open a book, and even when I try to study, I struggle to understand anything. My memory has gotten worse, and it’s like I’ve hit a mental block. My grades have also dropped, not drastically, but they’re nowhere near where they used to be, and it’s frustrating.

On top of med school, I’m also trying to study for board exams and learn a second language because I want to pursue my career abroad. However, I’ve been finding it impossible to balance everything. Learning a language alone feels overwhelming for me, and I always think I’ll never succeed (maybe because I don’t speak with native speakers). So, how can I manage it alongside everything else that’s already overwhelming?

The pressure is also coming from my family and friends. They still see me as someone who’s hardworking and successful, and that adds even more stress. I’ve always been introverted, but lately, it’s gotten worse. I barely socialize anymore, going from home to uni and back. It’s not just because of my academic workload—I’ve started feeling like I don’t want to deal with people at all. I feel more comfortable alone, but at the same time, I worry that this isolation will hurt me in the future.

In my country, med school is 5 years followed by 2 years of internship, where you finally get hands-on experience with patients. But here’s another issue: during the internship, you’re expected to seek out learning opportunities on your own. The doctors won’t necessarily teach you unless you ask for guidance. As an introvert, the idea of being proactive and constantly approaching doctors for help feels daunting, and I’m really anxious about how I’ll manage during this phase of my training.

With all these thoughts constantly running through my head, I can’t stop questioning whether I’ve chosen the right path. I feel like I’m not going to succeed in the future, and the self-doubt is eating away at me.

The secret to unlocking a happy and fulfilling life lies not in grand gestures but in small, everyday choices. It’s about embracing gratitude, cultivating positive relationships, and finding meaning in what we do. Happiness is not a destination but a journey—a collection of moments that we can create by shifting our mindset.

Focusing on gratitude is key. When we appreciate the small things—a sunny day, a kind word, or even a good cup of coffee—we shift our focus from what we lack to what we have. This simple practice of recognizing the good can elevate our mood and enhance our sense of well-being. It helps to counteract the natural tendency of our minds to dwell on negatives. Consistent gratitude over time rewires the brain to seek out positivity, making happiness a regular part of our lives.

Another essential aspect of a fulfilling life is nurturing our relationships. Human beings are social creatures, and strong connections with family, friends, and even colleagues can have a profound impact on our happiness. Positive interactions, deep conversations, and shared experiences create bonds that bring meaning and joy to life. By investing time and energy in building these relationships, we ensure that our lives are rich with emotional support and love, which are essential ingredients for long-term fulfillment.",1,1727933895.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

This is my love story, so here it goes.......(I'll try to be brief).

In 2019, I arrived in Poland, around 100 years after my family had fled due to many wars, hunger, misery, and ALOT of suffering caused from neighboring countries.

I’m a blonde, blue-eyed Latin American, not exactly exotic in Poland. On my very first day, I met a stunning blonde girl on a bench. After many coffees, skipped university classes, exploring forests and old castles, we fell deeply in love. Three months into dating, we grew even closer, and life felt perfect.

We become very in love with each other and 2020 starts....I lose my visa, my job, my savings, everything. We move together to the university dorms and I get to meet her family during this stage.

Despite everything, we were always happy—painting, laughing, running, partying. I started programming and delivering Uber by bicycle, which she found impressive since I was unused to the cold. Things seemed to be getting better, but then her family intervened. They thought I was just after a visa, and in 2022, she told me she’d started seeing a Polish man, much older than her. I decide to end our relationship in February 2022.

LONG STORY SHORT.....

Exactly when we break up, war starts in Ukraine and she makes him her new boyfriend. This complicates and delays my visa paperwork in Poland, which was affecting our relationship since it made it stressful for us and caused alot of uncertainty. The interesting thing is that we keep communication for all of 2022 and 2023, as if we were still together.

I later discovered she'd been cheating all along. In February 2023, when she revealed her pregnancy, I spiraled into a deep depression. She sensed it, and we both cried over the phone. She gets married that summer (2023). By her 7th or 8th month of pregnancy, I sent her a final letter:

""I had never in my life been hurt this way before.

I know you were unfaithful to me during our time together, and I did my best to forgive you.

Knowing how much I was in love with you, you lied to me and started a family behind my back while I was waiting for you for 2 years. It really destroyed me.

I hope nobody hurts you as deeply as I was hurt.

I wish you all the best""

Was I too harsh on her? Did I did good or bad on exposing her cheating during her last weeks of pregnancy?

Would this letter had affected her own image of herself since I never confessed this before?

Please ladies, give me your opinion. Its 2024 and I am recovering slowly, its just the pain is there and I need a woman's perspective.

We never spoke again after this.",2,1727933838.0,women,0,0.75,False

I had gone through a hellish break up about a year ago and moved back in with my parents just outside the city. it was probably the lowest time in my life - no job, no boyfriend (but at least no one abusive around me...) and honestly no hope.

even though i was pretty vulnerable, my therapist and i decided i'd try to volunteer as away to get out of my self and also give back, a way to make myself feel good through altruism. i joined a volunteer group through a friend of a friend, and met a really lovely group of people.

it was there that i met ben and carlos. they're in their mid to late 30s, ben is in tech, carlos is a nurse and we just immediately hit it off because i was an office manager for a startup in nyc before i moved back out here. we started chatting more and more and got coffees / drinks pretty regularly after volunteering, and the vibe was so chill. i learned they used to have a pug and want another one some day, that they've been together for 14 years and married for a decade and that ben wants kids (he has a big time cheesy dad vibe but also works out like crazy) and was slowly working on carlos to maybe say ok at some point.

i guess things started to change when i realized that ben and i had A LOT in common. it seemed like every time we got coffee or a drink we were the ones talking, which i totally didnt mind since i have a ton of introverted friends like carlos. i did (and still do) everything to make sure he doesnt feel like a third wheel... but like, sometimes the only words out of his mouth are ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" and he just sits quietly the rest of the time.

i won't lie, i found ben hot. he's tall, built, really cute smile and just obviously takes care of himself. carlos is short, kinda cute, a tiny bit heavy set with a little mexican accent (he's from somewhere out gaudalajara) but so nice. it's just that i guess when we all got together, i naturally made a lot more small talk with ben and we genuinely became really really good friends.

about 4 months... there was a slip up. it's still a secret and honestly i feel so torn telling carlos, but for now i just don't feel comfortable telling him. but like, me and ben had drinks one night cause carlos was in MX visiting his parents, and we were bored and decided to go back to their apartment (which we've done more than a few times) and it just felt different with just the two of there... like super charged.

we had much more to drink, watched a show on netflix (i forget which but there were a lot of sex scenes), and i guess we just started... like, making out lol. it almost felt like friends just kinda chilling and kissing at first, almost like a joke, but we got into it.

he looked sheepish and asked if he could like, feel me up and stuff. i took my shirt off (no bra bc i thought it was a chill night lol) and let him feel, i did the same to him and learned he was... definitely packing lol. and after a while of just doing that, kissing and just being chill, he wanted to like... try fingering me. it's still so wild, cause i didn't think gay guys would want to do that, but he seemed super curious so i basically gave him pointers. he was a natural and literally got me off twice in the span of 15 mins or so... i was floored. i returned the favor and sucked him off, which he loved and when he was done said he hadn't had someone swallow him in a while (ya i'm that type of girl lol). if he had wanted to fuck, i would've, but he seemed tired and it was 3am lol

it was obviously awkward for weeks after. i didn't go to the next volunteer session, and the next week ben called and told me that however i felt, it was all on him and that i shouldn't feel bad at all. it made me feel better about the whole if i'm being honest. i tried to drop it but also kinda felt disappointed...

then about 2 weeks later i get a call from ben that him and carlos are going to a party and that i should come. i've met their friends before but had never really hung out with all them, but it turned out they were amazing and i had such a nice night that night (i even met a girl who literally trained as a yogina or whatever). everyone got super drunk, it was fun.

the whole night, ben keeps looking over at me and smiling and i'm like, wtf? i thought we dropped it? but as it turns out, when me, ben and carlos headed out, ben stopped me on the street and was like, hey... carlos and i were talking and would you wanna do a threeway? i giggled like it was a joke cause they aren't open or anything with other guys... but it wasn't. carlos was quietly either looking at the ground or anything but me, occasionally smiling at me, and ben had a huge grin on his face. every part of me screamed don't do it, it's gonna change everything, but dumb drunk me said yes.

and that's how i ended up at their place until 4 in the morning, fucking ben and feeling a little guilty about the whole thing but having pretty much the best sex of my life... not even exagerating. and this is a guy who's never fucked a girl... it's crazy. i distinctly remember the point at which i forgot how many orgasms i had had and seeing ben with his huge grin on his face, just fucking me into the bed. carlos was asleep in the living room cause he had too much to drink and while i thought he was a good kisser, i just didn't really feel a spark with him like i did with ben.

since then, ben and i have been having an unofficial fwb type relationship going on for about 2-3 months and i spend far more time over at their place. it's honestly been mentally so amazing for me to have ben in my life, helping me reorient my life and feeling more confident about myself. and ben said he's been discovering so much about himself and that i'm key to it all. i've even been thinking about going back to school because ben believes in me so much.

we both love each other as friends and, obviously, as lovers and we regularly tell each other that, which is such a dose of positivity in my life, i can't live without it now. i got weird the first time he said it to me, but now it just feels natural. i dunno... it feels amazing!

but a part of me feels bad about carlos. like, me and him make small talk at volunteering or the few times we go out together (carlos rarely goes to post-volunteer drinks now and it's mostly just me and ben...), and i make every single effort to engage with him and crack jokes and stuff, but he just gives me his shy, curt little smile and doesn't really engage with me... sometimes it really hurts. i want my friend and lover's husband to like me, obviously, because i know it means so much to ben.

what am i doing wrong? is this wrong? should i feel bad? i know this isn't ""dirty"" but it's me opening up about something sexual, unconventional and maybe a little dirty and wanting a little help and perspective on how i should feel, because no one really tells you how to handle a situation like this lol.",0,1727933805.0,bisexual,0,0.5,False

or 11th, General, male, decent va, bad scores in math though I think that I can score way higher, scoring near or below the cutoff by 10-15 marks or clearing the cutoff by a good score but not clearing either sa or mcq.

nearly the same score, I don't think that I'm having problems with theory , but I'm facing trouble in actually getting into the exam( context below).  I thought that ill just give a mock a week and work on the weak stuff in the meanwhile, but I think I'll skip next weeks mock and just do math sectionals.

2023 pyq: Clearing the normal cutoff due to good VA marks but not in MCQ( even though I did improve in the sectionals).

Did the math portion of this test again under nearly the same time constraints, scoring nearly 30 marks more. So I could have scored 230 in 2023s pyq which I feel is a decent score, don't know the cutoff tho, but should be around it. The issue is that I'm unable to get to this score due to dumb mistakes.

Also 1, need to really work on negatives and stop making guesses. It really does affect the numbers ah.

Also 2: I do face the issue of hyper fixating on a mcq and spending 10 mins on it(( Have conc issues (genetic, taking meds), am working on it tho). So I might just need to drink a cup of coffee and give the paper lol.

[2023 pyq](https://preview.redd.it/y9g8jpy35hsd1.png?width=1913&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8eb859ee59534f91a4c1ea0b76ba9ce136e8610)

I don't know what to say. I do have AB unlimited sectionals.

Question(s): 1) Do I give b2b Math( mcq + sa) sectionals on AB and not focus on theory as much( not that I am, but I have started doing it( please note that I have other obligations too and don't have a lot of time for ipm, 8-10 hrs a week maybe, giving min 1 hour a day but I'll still handle the theory  if req))?

2) And if so, how can I find tougher math sectionals on ABs site or do they get progressively tougher as I do more of them? Or are they IPM pyq level but its just that I'm a lot calmer during these sectionals and not in the actual mock

( I do tend to calm down as the paper goes on, ends up happening by VA)

3) Should I still give the weekly mock or just focus on sectionals

4) Might be a dumb q, but I can't give VA first right?

My girlfriend and I will be doing a 10 night cruise in January through Asia and we’re looking into purchasing a non-alcoholic drinks package that includes coffees and milkshakes etc. Is there any way we can get away with just sharing one package? Are you able to get multiple coffees at once from the cafe or is there a limit to how often I can get one?

Should it? ","i'm mia, and as the title states, i'm going through a bit of a romantic crisis lol... i need help!

I had gone through a hellish break up about a year ago and moved back in with my parents just outside the city. it was probably the lowest time in my life - no job, no boyfriend (but at least no one abusive around me...) and honestly no hope.

even though i was pretty vulnerable, my therapist and i decided i'd try to volunteer as away to get out of my self and also give back, a way to make myself feel good through altruism. i joined a volunteer group through a friend of a friend, and met a really lovely group of people.

it was there that i met ben and carlos. they're in their mid to late 30s, ben is in tech, carlos is a nurse and we just immediately hit it off because i was an office manager for a startup in nyc before i moved back out here. we started chatting more and more and got coffees / drinks pretty regularly after volunteering, and the vibe was so chill. i learned they used to have a pug and want another one some day, that they've been together for 14 years and married for a decade and that ben wants kids (he has a big time cheesy dad vibe but also works out like crazy) and was slowly working on carlos to maybe say ok at some point.

i guess things started to change when i realized that ben and i had A LOT in common. it seemed like every time we got coffee or a drink we were the ones talking, which i totally didnt mind since i have a ton of introverted friends like carlos. i did (and still do) everything to make sure he doesnt feel like a third wheel... but like, sometimes the only words out of his mouth are ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" and he just sits quietly the rest of the time.

i won't lie, i found ben hot. he's tall, built, really cute smile and just obviously takes care of himself. carlos is short, kinda cute, a tiny bit heavy set with a little mexican accent (he's from somewhere out gaudalajara) but so nice. it's just that i guess when we all got together, i naturally made a lot more small talk with ben and we genuinely became really really good friends.

about 4 months... there was a slip up. it's still a secret and honestly i feel so torn telling carlos, but for now i just don't feel comfortable telling him. but like, me and ben had drinks one night cause carlos was in MX visiting his parents, and we were bored and decided to go back to their apartment (which we've done more than a few times) and it just felt different with just the two of there... like super charged.

we had much more to drink, watched a show on netflix (i forget which but there were a lot of sex scenes), and i guess we just started... like, making out lol. it almost felt like friends just kinda chilling and kissing at first, almost like a joke, but we got into it.

he looked sheepish and asked if he could like, feel me up and stuff. i took my shirt off (no bra bc i thought it was a chill night lol) and let him feel, i did the same to him and learned he was... definitely packing lol. and after a while of just doing that, kissing and just being chill, he wanted to like... try fingering me. it's still so wild, cause i didn't think gay guys would want to do that, but he seemed super curious so i basically gave him pointers. he was a natural and literally got me off twice in the span of 15 mins or so... i was floored. i returned the favor and sucked him off, which he loved and when he was done said he hadn't had someone swallow him in a while (ya i'm that type of girl lol). if he had wanted to fuck, i would've, but he seemed tired and it was 3am lol

it was obviously awkward for weeks after. i didn't go to the next volunteer session, and the next week ben called and told me that however i felt, it was all on him and that i shouldn't feel bad at all. it made me feel better about the whole if i'm being honest. i tried to drop it but also kinda felt disappointed...

then about 2 weeks later i get a call from ben that him and carlos are going to a party and that i should come. i've met their friends before but had never really hung out with all them, but it turned out they were amazing and i had such a nice night that night (i even met a girl who literally trained as a yogina or whatever). everyone got super drunk, it was fun.

the whole night, ben keeps looking over at me and smiling and i'm like, wtf? i thought we dropped it? but as it turns out, when me, ben and carlos headed out, ben stopped me on the street and was like, hey... carlos and i were talking and would you wanna do a threeway? i giggled like it was a joke cause they aren't open or anything with other guys... but it wasn't. carlos was quietly either looking at the ground or anything but me, occasionally smiling at me, and ben had a huge grin on his face. every part of me screamed don't do it, it's gonna change everything, but dumb drunk me said yes.

and that's how i ended up at their place until 4 in the morning, fucking ben and feeling a little guilty about the whole thing but having pretty much the best sex of my life... not even exagerating. and this is a guy who's never fucked a girl... it's crazy. i distinctly remember the point at which i forgot how many orgasms i had had and seeing ben with his huge grin on his face, just fucking me into the bed. carlos was asleep in the living room cause he had too much to drink and while i thought he was a good kisser, i just didn't really feel a spark with him like i did with ben.

since then, ben and i have been having an unofficial fwb type relationship going on for about 2-3 months and i spend far more time over at their place. it's honestly been mentally so amazing for me to have ben in my life, helping me reorient my life and feeling more confident about myself. and ben said he's been discovering so much about himself and that i'm key to it all. i've even been thinking about going back to school because ben believes in me so much.

we both love each other as friends and, obviously, as lovers and we regularly tell each other that, which is such a dose of positivity in my life, i can't live without it now. i got weird the first time he said it to me, but now it just feels natural. i dunno... it feels amazing!

but a part of me feels bad about carlos. like, me and him make small talk at volunteering or the few times we go out together (carlos rarely goes to post-volunteer drinks now and it's mostly just me and ben...), and i make every single effort to engage with him and crack jokes and stuff, but he just gives me his shy, curt little smile and doesn't really engage with me... sometimes it really hurts. i want my friend and lover's husband to like me, obviously, because i know it means so much to ben.

what am i doing wrong? is this wrong? should i feel bad? i know this isn't ""dirty"" but it's me opening up about something sexual, unconventional and maybe a little dirty and wanting a little help and perspective on how i should feel, because no one really tells you how to handle a situation like this lol.",0,1727933010.0,AskLGBT,1,0.25,False

Ein Kaffeevollautomat ist eine sinnvolle Investition, insbesondere wenn Sie mehrere Tassen pro Tag konsumieren. Selbst bei der Auswahl hochwertiger Bohnen sind Sie langfristig günstiger unterwegs.

# Einfache Reinigung

Viele moderne Kaffeevollautomaten sind mit automatischen Reinigungsprogrammen ausgestattet. Dies bedeutet, dass der Aufwand für die Reinigung erheblich reduziert wird. Regelmäßige Reinigung ist wichtig, um die Qualität des Kaffees zu sichern. Die meisten Maschinen bieten eine einfache Möglichkeit zur Entkalkung und Reinigung des Milchsystems.

# Frischen Kaffeegenuss jederzeit

Die Möglichkeit, jederzeit frischen Kaffee zu genießen, ist ein weiterer Vorteil des Kaffeevollautomaten. Sie können die Bohnen direkt vor der Zubereitung mahlen, was dafür sorgt, dass die Aromen erhalten bleiben. Frisch gemahlener Kaffee schmeckt nicht nur besser, sondern kann auch die Konzentration und das Wohlbefinden fördern.

# Individuelle Anpassungsmöglichkeiten

Einige Kaffeevollautomaten bieten die Möglichkeit, persönliche Profile zu erstellen. So können Sie die Einstellungen für die Stärke, die Temperatur und die Menge nach Ihren Wünschen anpassen.

# So wählen Sie den idealen Kaffeevollautomaten aus

Die Auswahl eines Kaffeevollautomaten kann eine herausfordernde Entscheidung sein. Es gibt viele Faktoren, die Sie berücksichtigen sollten, um sicherzustellen, dass Sie das beste Gerät für Ihre Bedürfnisse finden. In diesem Artikel werden wir wichtige Kriterien erläutern, die Ihnen helfen, den idealen Kaffeevollautomaten auszuwählen.

# Bedarfsermittlung

Bevor Sie mit der Suche nach einem Kaffeevollautomaten beginnen, sollten Sie Ihren Bedarf ermitteln. Überlegen Sie, wie viele Tassen Kaffee Sie täglich konsumieren. Wenn Sie ein Vieltrinker sind, benötigen Sie ein Modell mit einem größeren Wassertank und einer höheren Kaffeemahlkapazität. Auch die Anzahl der Benutzer spielt eine Rolle. Ein Gerät für eine Familie sollte mehr Funktionen bieten als ein Modell für Einzelpersonen.

# Wahl des Typs von Kaffeevollautomaten

Es gibt verschiedene Typen von Kaffeevollautomaten, die unterschiedliche Funktionen bieten. Einige sind einfacher zu bedienen, während andere umfangreiche Anpassungsmöglichkeiten haben. Hier sind einige gängige Typen:

* **Kompakte Geräte:** Ideal für kleine Küchen, bieten grundlegende Funktionen und sind oft kostengünstig.
* **Vollautomatische Geräte:** Diese Maschinen übernehmen nahezu den gesamten Prozess von der Bohne bis zur Tasse und sind meist mit einem Milchaufschäumer ausgestattet.
* **Halbautomatische Geräte:** Erfordern mehr manuelle Eingriffe, bieten jedoch mehr Kontrolle über den Brühprozess.

# Funktionen und Einstellungen

Ein weiterer wichtiger Aspekt bei der Auswahl eines Kaffeevollautomaten sind die angebotenen Funktionen. Je mehr Funktionen, desto flexibler können Sie Ihren Kaffee zubereiten. Achten Sie besonders auf:

* **Milchaufschäumer:** Für Liebhaber von Cappuccino oder Latte Macchiato ist ein integrierter Milchaufschäumer ein Muss.
* **Variabilität der Kaffeestärke:** Die Möglichkeit, die Stärke Ihres Kaffees anzupassen, kann den Unterschied ausmachen.
* **Temperaturkontrolle:** Einige Modelle ermöglichen es Ihnen, die Brühtemperatur zu regulieren.

# Wartung und Reinigung

Je besser die Reinigungstechniken eines Geräts sind, desto einfacher wird Ihr Alltag. Viele moderne Kaffeevollautomaten bieten automatisierte Reinigungsprogramme an. Überprüfen Sie, ob der Wasser- und Kaffeebohnenbehälter leicht zugänglich sind.

# Kundenerfahrungen und Testberichte

Bevor Sie sich für ein Modell entscheiden, ist es ratsam, sich Testimonials und Testberichte anzusehen. Verbraucherbewertungen geben Ihnen wertvolle Einblicke in die Leistung und Zuverlässigkeit des Kaffeevollautomaten. Websites, die **„Delonghi Kaffeevollautomat Test“** durchführen, bieten oft eine umfassende Analyse und können Ihnen helfen, die Vor- und Nachteile verschiedener Modelle zu verstehen.

# Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis

Der Preis ist immer ein wichtiger Faktor. Setzen Sie sich ein Budget, aber überlegen Sie auch, welche Funktionen für Sie unverzichtbar sind. Hochpreisige Modelle bieten oft zusätzliche Features und eine bessere Qualität, aber es gibt auch viele erschwingliche Optionen, die hervorragende Leistung bieten.

# Zusammenfassung

Die Wahl des idealen Kaffeevollautomaten hängt von mehreren Faktoren ab. Berücksichtigen Sie Ihre individuellen Bedürfnisse, die gewünschte Vielseitigkeit der Funktionen und Ihr Budget. Machen Sie sich auch die Mühe, einige Testberichte und Nutzererfahrungen zu lesen, um eine informierte Entscheidung zu treffen. Mit der richtigen Recherche finden Sie das perfekte Gerät, das nicht nur Ihren Kaffeetruck erfüllt, sondern auch Ihr tägliches Ritual bereichert.

# Häufige Fehler bei der Verwendung von Kaffeevollautomaten

Kaffeevollautomaten sind eine wunderbare Ergänzung für jede Küche. Sie bieten hochwertigen Kaffee auf Knopfdruck. Doch viele Nutzer machen häufig Fehler, die die Qualität des Kaffees beeinträchtigen oder die Langlebigkeit des Geräts verringern. Schauen wir uns einige dieser typischen Fehler an und wie Sie sie vermeiden können.

# Die falsche Bohne wählen

Die Wahl der richtigen Kaffeebohnensorte ist entscheidend für den Geschmack. Viele Menschen verwenden die falschen Bohnen oder solche, die nicht für Vollautomaten geeignet sind. Hier sind einige Tipps zur Auswahl:

* **Bohnensorte:** Wählen Sie Arabica-Bohnen für einen sanfteren Geschmack oder Robusta für mehr Intensität.
* **Frische:** Kaufen Sie Bohnen, die nicht älter als zwei Wochen sind, um das beste Aroma zu erhalten.
* **Röstgrad:** Achten Sie darauf, dass der Röstgrad zu Ihrem Geschmacksprofil passt. Eine mittlere Röstung ist oft eine gute Wahl für Einsteiger.

# Falscher Mahlgrad

Ein weiterer häufiger Fehler ist der falsche Mahlgrad. Der Mahlgrad sollte auf die verwendete Bohne und die Art des Kaffees abgestimmt sein. Ein zu feiner Mahlgrad kann zu einem bitteren Geschmack führen, während ein zu grober Mahlgrad den Kaffee wässrig macht. Ideal ist es, verschiedene Mahlgrade auszuprobieren, um die perfekte Einstellung für Ihren Geschmack zu finden.

# Unzureichende Reinigung

Die Reinigung des Kaffeevollautomaten ist unerlässlich, um eine konstante Kaffeequalität zu gewährleisten. Viele Nutzer vernachlässigen die regelmäßige Reinigung, was zu Ablagerungen und Geschmacksveränderungen führt. Hier sind einige Reinigungsrichtlinien:

* **Tägliche Reinigung:** Entleeren Sie den Tresterbehälter und die Wassertropfschale jeden Tag.
* **Wöchentliche Pflege:** Führen Sie eine gründliche Reinigung des Brühsystems durch, um Kaffeefett und Öle zu entfernen.
* **Monatliche Kontrolle:** Reinigen Sie die Milchaufschäumdüse und den Wassertank regelmäßig, um Bakterienansammlungen zu verhindern.

# Falsches Wasser verwenden

Das Wasser, das Sie verwenden, hat maßgeblichen Einfluss auf den Geschmack des Kaffees. Viele Menschen nutzen Leitungswasser ohne sich über mögliche Verunreinigungen Gedanken zu machen. Achten Sie auf Folgendes:

* **Wasserhärte:** Verwenden Sie gefiltertes oder mineralarmes Wasser, um eine optimale Kaffeequalität zu erzielen.
* **Temperatur:** Das Wasser sollte beim Brühen zwischen 90 und 95 Grad Celsius liegen.
* **Reinheit:** Stellen Sie sicher, dass das Wasser frei von Verunreinigungen ist, um einen klaren Geschmack zu garantieren.

# Überfüllung des Bohnenfachs

Manche Nutzer neigen dazu, das Bohnenfach zu überfüllen, was zu einer ungleichmäßigen Entnahme der Bohnen führt. Dies kann die Qualität des Kaffees beeinträchtigen und die Maschine belasten. Achten Sie darauf, das Bohnenfach nicht über die empfohlene Füllmenge hinaus zu befüllen, um eine gleichmäßige Mahlung und Entnahme zu gewährleisten.

# Nicht auf die Maschine hören

Kaffeevollautomaten geben oft akustische Signale von sich, wenn etwas nicht stimmt. Viele Nutzer ignorieren diese Warnungen oder verstehen sie nicht. Achten Sie darauf, ob Ihre Maschine ungewöhnliche Geräusche macht oder Warnleuchten angezeigt werden. In solchen Fällen sollten Sie die Maschine sofort prüfen, um Schäden zu vermeiden.

# Zu selten Wasserwechsel

Ein weiterer häufig gemachter Fehler ist das Vergessen, das Wasser im Wassertank regelmäßig zu wechseln. Stagnierendes Wasser kann unangenehme Gerüche entwickeln und den Geschmack des Kaffees beeinträchtigen. Achten Sie darauf, jeden Tag frisches Wasser zu verwenden und den Wassertank gründlich zu reinigen.

Durch das Vermeiden dieser häufigen Fehler können Sie die Qualität Ihres Kaffees verbessern und die Lebensdauer Ihres Kaffeevollautomaten verlängern. Gönnen Sie sich den perfekten Kaffeegenuss, indem Sie auf die kleinen Details achten!

# Pflege und Wartung Ihres DeLonghi Kaffeevollautomaten

Hier sind einige praktische Tipps, um sicherzustellen, dass Ihr DeLonghi Kaffeevollautomat immer in Bestform bleibt.

# Regelmäßige Innenreinigung

* Reinigen Sie sie gründlich unter fließendem Wasser und lassen Sie sie trocknen.
* Wischen Sie die Innenflächen des Automaten mit einem weichen, feuchten Tuch ab.

# Wassertank und Wasserfilter

Der Wassertank spielt eine entscheidende Rolle für die Qualität Ihres Kaffees. Achten Sie darauf, den Wassertank regelmäßig zu leeren und zu reinigen. Schimmelige oder kalkhaltige Ablagerungen können den Geschmack Ihres Kaffees negativ beeinflussen. Verwenden Sie kalkfreies Wasser und wechseln Sie den Wasserfilter gemäß den Anweisungen des Herstellers.

# Kaffeevollautomat entkalken

Eine regelmäßige Entkalkung ist unerlässlich, um die Lebensdauer Ihres DeLonghi Kaffeevollautomaten zu verlängern. Kalkablagerungen können sich negativ auf die Funktion und den Geschmack auswirken. Verwenden Sie ein geeignetes Entkalkungsmittel und befolgen Sie diese Schritte:

1. Füllen Sie den Wassertank mit der Entkalkungslösung und Wasser.
2. Starten Sie den Entkalkungszyklus gemäß den Anweisungen im Benutzerhandbuch.
3. Spülen Sie den Wassertank nach der Entkalkung gründlich aus und füllen Sie ihn mit frischem Wasser.

# Die Brüheinheit reinigen

Die Brüheinheit sollte mindestens einmal pro Woche gereinigt werden, um eine optimale Kaffeequalität zu gewährleisten. Folgen Sie diesen Schritten:

* Entfernen Sie die Brüheinheit wie oben beschrieben.
* Spülen Sie die Einheit unter fließendem Wasser, um Kaffee- und Fettreste zu entfernen.
* Lassen Sie die Brüheinheit vollständig trocknen, bevor Sie sie wieder einsetzen.

# Außenreinigung des Geräts

Die Außenreinigung Ihres DeLonghi Kaffeevollautomaten sollte ebenfalls nicht vernachlässigt werden. Verwenden Sie ein weiches Tuch mit milder Seifenlösung, um die Oberfläche sauber zu halten. Vermeiden Sie abrasive Reinigungsmittel, die die Oberfläche zerkratzen könnten.

# Regelmäßige Wartung durch Fachpersonal

Obwohl Sie viele Reinigungen selbst durchführen können, ist es ratsam, regelmäßig einen Fachmann zu Rate zu ziehen. Eine professionelle Wartung kann mögliche Probleme im Voraus erkennen und beheben, bevor sie kostspielige Reparaturen erfordern.

# Auf die Warnsignale achten

Beobachten Sie stets die Warnsignale Ihres DeLonghi Kaffeevollautomaten. Blinkende Lichter oder Fehlermeldungen können auf ein Problem hinweisen, das sofortige Aufmerksamkeit erfordert. Ignorieren Sie solche Signale nicht, denn sie können eine wichtige Rolle bei der Erhaltung der Funktionstüchtigkeit Ihres Geräts spielen.

Zusammenfassend ist die Pflege und Wartung Ihres DeLonghi Kaffeevollautomaten entscheidend, um die Lebensdauer des Geräts zu verlängern und die Qualität Ihres Kaffees zu sichern.

1fv0hpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/pchelp/comments/1fv0hpb/hardware_issue/,Hardware issue,"I built a new pc a couple months ago and I've been having nothing but trouble with it. When I first built it I was getting screen tearing which I know is a gpu problem but that has since stopped. 

The problem I'm having now is whenever I'm playing a game on my pc I can't have anything else running on a different screen. 

Normally on my previous pc build I would play a game and have YouTube, Netflix, twitch, etc. Open on a different screen and watch or listen to something while I play. But for some reason now on this build if I try to do that the video doesn't play at all or it's extremely laggy or just cuts and buffers until I close the game. Also now I get what seems like huge lag spikes on my games. It's not often but when it does happen it happens for about 30 seconds to a minute and then goes away. For example I was playing world of warcraft and I started to get a lag spike and my computer was telling me I was using 89% of my gpu anf the only other thing that was open was discord.

I'm about 90% sure it's a gpu problem because of the screen tearing I had originally several months ago but I'm not convinced that it couldn't be the cpu.

Also I have 4, 32gb sticks of ram in my pc and I took out 2 sticks to see if it was a ram problem but that didn't effect it at all. 

I'll now list my pc specs incase someone knows anything about a certain part it could be.

Current build with problem
Cpu: Intel Core i9-14900K Raptor Lake 3.2GHz Twenty Four-Core LGA 1700 Boxed Processor

Gpu: Gigabyte NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Windforce Overclocked Triple Fan 12GB GDDR6X PCIe 4.0 Graphics Card

Mobo: MSI Z790-P Pro WiFi D4 Intel LGA 1700 ATX Motherboard

Ram: 4 sticks of G.SKILL Trident Z RGB Series (Intel XMP) DDR4 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 3600MT/s

Also this was my previous build that I had no issues with

Gpu: Intel Core i9 9th Gen - Core i9-9900K Coffee Lake 8-Core, 16-Thread, 3.6 GHz (5.0 GHz Turbo) LGA 1151 (300 Series) 95W

Gpu: GIGABYTE GeForce GTX 1060 6GB GDDR5 PCI Express 3.0 x16 ATX Video Card

Mobo: MSI MPG Z390 GAMING PRO CARBON LGA 1151 (300 Series) Intel Z390 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.1 ATX Intel Motherboard

Ram: 4 sticks of CORSAIR Vengeance LPX 16GB (2 x 8GB) 288-Pin PC RAM DDR4 2666

I don't not have the old build so I can't swap part to test it other wise I'd've done that already

If someone can tell me if i need to replace a part or has an idea on how to fix my issue please let me know, I just want to make sure I don't go trowing money at the wrong things.

Hey coffee enthusiasts!

I recently jumped on the monsoon sale bandwagon and ordered the Tulum Thogarihunkal Washed Light Roast after seeing it recommended by so many here. I was really excited to try it, but for some reason, I’m not getting the flavors I was expecting. I’ve brewed it both with a V60 pour-over and cold brew, but it just hasn’t hit the spot. 😕

Has anyone else had this experience? Am I missing a specific recipe or technique that brings out the best in this coffee? Would love any advice or recommendations from those who’ve mastered this brew!

For context I have a GF and we’re on the stage na pinakilala niya na ako sa parents niya, I (M25), matured mag-isip, date to marry, conservative, all out in loving, overthink malala, mabait, funny and laking probinsya. She is 27, happy, loud, mabait, and very open about anything.

Last night, we went out to go on a date. While we are busy conversing, her ex has messaged her saying “hello” and she showed me the message. I was just chill that time, then I just casually asked her “Why would he message you “hello”?” She said that it might be because in the afternoon, she saw her ex’s parents sa isang restau, but she did not approached them, instead she took a photo and sent it to her ex. She told me that she did it just for nothing, she was just happy to see them. This incident had got on my nerves, I was really pissed off. She repeteadly apologized, asking me what does I want her to do para mawala yung inis ko? She explained everything naman what she did was wrong, she does not invalidate my feelings, and that even her ex will message her, it would be her who will cut the chase, and she was asking me that maybe I still not trust her. Pero on my mind, it’s not a bad thing to be nice to your ex’s family but doing something like that hindi ko lang magets. I really love and trust her.

One time also, she showed me ulit na her ex is asking her to accompany him sa pedicure and she declined. He was asking her sometimes ng coffee out. And everytime nakekwento niya my blood just literally boil.

And to this moment, inis parin ako. I really cannot grasp kung bakit kailangan pa ng mga ganun with the past? Kahit pa sinabi niya na they’ve become friends after their relationship and they did part ways without bad blood, I really can’t understand it. I just can’t stand na they are still in touch. Plus they live on the same village and they have some same circle of friends. Tho she already explained na, there will be instances that they will meet coincidentally since their village was small.

One thing that I know, she always assures me that she will never hurt me, she will protect, and I’m the only one. I really love her.

Please, I just want to ask someone na what should I do para hindi kami magtampuhan sa mga ganito? Is this something na kailangan kong pagtampuhan? Or I’ll just put my trust on her?",2,1727932712.0,adviceph,38,0.67,False

1fv0gak,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fv0gak,New French Press,"Hi Everybody,
 
I’ve been using a French Press for the past 10 years or so, but it recently broke, and I got a new and bigger one.
 
I’ve been pouring over this Reddit and realized maybe I should be a little more thoughtful when I make coffee.
 
The press is 36 oz, so I used 6 rounded scoops (see pic) of coffee. Does that sound like the right amount? Basically, the press makes 2 full 16 oz. mugs of coffee.
 
(I am very bad at math, so all the posts about ratios and grams and ounces doesn’t stick 😢 ).
 
I filled the press about halfway and waited 30 seconds, then gently stirred.
 
Filled it the rest of the way up, and let it brew for 6 minutes. I always did 4 minutes before, but a lot of people here suggest longer, so I thought I would try it. The instructions say 3 minutes.

I’m very happy with my first cup from the new press 🤩
 
I’m curious, what is the specific difference between 3 and 6 minutes in terms of the quality of the coffee? More caffeine?
 
I always thought that you weren’t supposed to leave the extra coffee in the press, that it would get bitter, but I decided to leave it in the press, and drank the rest about 30 minutes later and it tasted great, not different from the first cup, just not as warm.
 
Anyway, thanks for all the tips, and the passion for French press coffee 🤩🤩🤩",1,1727932632.0,frenchpress,1,1.0,False

1fv0ffq,https://i.redd.it/b0rr0s7l6hsd1.png,Hario Pegasus ,"Hi everyone! This is my first post here

I recently got this brewer and I've been struggling to get the most out of it. 

To begin, most information I've been able to find online consist mostly of comparations to the mighty v60

I understand most people though it was some kind of v60/Melitta mixture when it first came out (which it is) but I feel like this made most people just compare it to this two brewers and not actually take the time to understand it as a different thing.

Most general info I could find talks about either conical profiles or flat bottom ones, but there is not that much information about this ""Melitta"" profile and how it actually works. 

Searching for Melitta info gets you mostly amateur info or osmotic flow, but not really anything that deeply analyzes how to get the most out of this profile. 

By now all I can say is that this brewer seems to be better on ""high extraction"" recipes that aim for a higher body. 

Compared to a v60 (I know, here we go again but that's the only other brewer I've got) it drains slower and seems to be way more responsive to swirls/shakes (like the ones the x bloom does) since it usually gets clogged when you do this. 

However, while trying a 2 pour method I noticed that not doing the swirls resulted in an almost water tasting cup of coffee, like it extracted nothing vs a decent cup when swirling. 

By now, the most consistent recipe I've got is a 3 pour recipe, staying above the 2 holes at high altitude and 7ml/s 

So, for 15g dose:
01:00 -> 45ml
01:30 -> 150ml
02:00 -> 250ml 
For a 1:16.66 ratio 

However, by now it lacks complexity and just tastes like coffee


Let me know if you have this brewer and know a different approach to get the most out of it or if you are struggling with it too. 

I will try to post any updates I get as time passes and I learn more about it.

I’m really into discussing game strategies, analyzing player performances, and of course, making those crucial picks for our pools. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just getting into it, I'm excited to exchange tips and stories. Beyond football, I’m looking for friends who enjoy hanging out, whether it’s catching a game together, hitting the gym, or just sharing a few laughs over a coffee. I value genuine connections and hope to meet people who are also interested in forming lasting friendships.

We started with a little back story and what I was struggling with. She asked a few questions based on my intake docs. Typical stuff, I assume.

She seemed nice enough, kind of quirky and casual. I later realized, however, that I began to make judgements quite early about her and the experience:

1) her camera was placed on what looked like a coffee table and she was sitting on a couch looking down at it. It came off unprofessional (or too casual for my liking?)

2) there were a few awkward (albeit short) silences, which made it seem like she wasn't sure or prepared for what to talk about. The conversation also seemed a little disorganized. I noticed myself watching the clock a lot.

3) she didn't have a paid Zoom account we could use so I had to provide my own to avoid getting kicked off after 45 min. Luckily my friend had one we could use.

4) her personality came off nervous and scatterbrained rather than confident and intentional.

I mentioned some small things I was doing to help myself get out of my depression and she agreed with all of them. At the end of the call I wondered what we can possibly accomplish in future calls. I left feeling worse than I started and took a depression nap.

I would like to give this therapy thing a real shot and I'm stuck wondering if I should find someone else. 

Is it common to be skeptical of the therapist in the beginning? Does it sound like it's just not a good match, or are my judgements  unreasonable? Or a reflection of something that I need to work on? Has anyone else had a similar experience?

After a bout of Covid and food poisoning in July, I was left completely wrecked. Eating a measly amount of clean calories would have me in intense stomach pain, and all day nausea. I was weak, fuzzy, and had major headaches from caffeine withdrawal. 

I took 40mg of pantoprazole for approx 6 weeks, and 20mg for 1 week. My stomach was feeling much better and my nausea had almost totally subsided.

However, I started to develop intense abdominal pain the last two weeks of PPI usage. Hours after eating I would feel stabbing, throbbing pain in my intestines. I was having multiple stools daily with visible chunks of food. I figured the PPI must have been slowing my motility right down and wreaking havoc on my digestion. 

For a week I’ve been taking either 20mg or 40mg of Pepcid daily in place of the PPI. I’m happy to report the abdominal pain is subsiding and I’m feeling close to normal again 🤞🏻. My rebound reflux has been super minimal. This week I’ve been reintroducing 1tsp of matcha or 1 espresso shot in an almond milk latte daily and it’s been great. 

During my time I’ve continued to eat the Gastritis Healing Book diet + Lean ground bison and lean steak. I already ate very close to this diet so it felt very natural for me. I rarely drink alcohol anymore, so putting a pause on that has been easy.

I will no longer be drinking coffee on an empty stomach. My addiction to coffee, energy drinks, pre workout, and acidic sparkling water will have to be dialled way back. It wasn’t uncommon for me to have 2 large coffees and 3 bubly sodas or 1 coffee, 1 energy drink, and a Coke Zero in one day. 

I’m going to be heading to a naturopath and continuing my own research to come up with a plan to further my healing.

Supplements I took daily during this time were:

- 2 large capsules of Omega 3s
- 3000 IU vitamin D and 120mcg K2
- 150mg of Elemental Magnesium L-Threonate
- 4 capsules of Thorne GI relief 
- 1 PepZin GI Zinc-L-Carnosine

1fv07v1,https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/1fv07v1/my_new_favorite_coffee_prep/,My new favorite coffee prep,"I'm a pretty serious coffee drinker, and my wife is, as well. We have a large rotating stock of coffee, and several different ways of making coffee, either with or without electricity. We have our traditional coffee maker, of course,  or can make coffee with our old fashioned percolator over virtually any burner, or in our stainless French Press by heating water on our solo stove (wood),  or one of our several campstoves (propane or white gas), or by heating water on our charcoal or propane grills. We also stock a few different types of instant coffee that we have taste-tested and found to be acceptable. Recently, though, we found some ""cold brew"" instant coffee (made by Nescafe) on clearance for 50% off, and we bought several jars. Here's the thing, I often prefer cold coffee over hot coffee, so I would often put any leftover coffee in the fridge at the end of the day to drink the next morning. I've tried making regular instant coffee with cold water, and it just never works out very well. 

I recently got sent out on a remote job assignment that lasted for several days worth of 16-hour Graveyard shifts without access to power, working in an area where open flame is absolutely forbidden. I took along a jar of that cold brew instant coffee, and being able to just add it to cold bottles of water out of the cooler and have actually decent-tasting iced coffee was absolutely amazing! It definitely  helped me maintain my sanity, my productivity levels, and my ability to interact with crew members in a non-hostile manner! 

Just as a side note, before someone starts in with the ""you need to wean yourself off of caffeine now"" thing, we also grow Yaupon Holly and regular tea plants for caffeine, so if things really go so sideways that we can't get coffee, that's our tertiary backup plan for that!",6,1727931691.0,preppers,0,1.0,False
1fv07ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/1fv07ni/when_a_chill_noreastern_blows/,When A Chill Nor'Eastern Blows ,"I was cold. I'm not sure if that word even comes close to where I was at that time, suffice to say that the signs of hypothermia kept running like a pilots checklist through my brain. 



In the last couple of days, the only relief I had from the below freezing temperatures was the brief moments spent in the convenience store where I went for my daily constitutional, and even then I didn't get enough time to fully thaw out.
     


Every joint in my body seemed to be freezing in place. No matter how I bent my legs or moved my arms, as soon as they were motionless for more than thirty seconds, they became steadily more resistant to motion, and it seemed to me that it wouldn't be too much longer and I wouldn't have the energy to overcome the resistance any more. At times, I thought that I could feel the presence of dooms hand just waiting for my body to give up this fight. 
     


Body found under the Third Street bridge would read the little paragraph if my death would even merit that much. 
    


My mind toggled between welcoming the inevitable and the relief it would bring from the pain and anguish that was still fresh and constantly searing itself deeper and deeper into my soul, and then back to the innate drive to survive that even a virus carried in it's DNA. 
    


It would be so easy to just let go of the struggle and slip off into sleep and never wake up again. No more hurt, frustration, or tears, just sleep. Possibly the best sleep that a human can experience. 



I was still at the point where the thought of never seeing my son, never being able to make him laugh or hear him say, ""Dad, I just love you so much!"" would double me over in a pain so overwhelming that at times I released it by howling at the night sky like some wounded animal caught in a trap with no escape. If there was a god, I hated the son of a b**ch.
    


I was living under a bridge, which usually gave some measure of relief from the wind, but not tonight. Mother Nature had done her geometry homework for this winter bluster, and the wind was coming in wave after wave at just the right angle that the bridge seemed to strengthen the cold blast, like the way squeezing the end of the hose made the waters exit pressure stronger. 



All the garbage that had accumulated over the years was blown to one side of my  luxury estate where it built up against the chain link fence that was erected to keep people like me out. I thought back to the snow drift fences in Wichita and how they would be completely covered by the wind driven snow on the Great Plains. 
    


My sleeping bag now offered very little resistance to icy temperatures. The night before, I had urinated all over myself in my sleep, and the bag was wet, nearly useless. My brain injury had managed to short circuit the signals sent from my bladder to my brain, which caused me more than once to be standing there talking to someone while the dark stain spread across my lap. I would be blithely unaware till I could feel my legs getting wet and cold. 



I woke up this morning soaked in urine, with nothing to change into. The day before, someone had come into my space and taken every piece of clothing I had except what I had on at the time of the robbery, so I had walked around all day covered and smelling of urine. 



But, thanks to my brain injury, I didn't think too much about it. Or, rather, I kept forgetting about it. In the unfortunate moments when it occurred or dawned on me that I was walking around covered in piss, the overwhelming feeling of worthlessness, shame, and despair was so strong that all I could do was sit somewhere by myself on a bench and hang my head. 



I was now an honest to God piece of walking shit, no one was going to give a man soaked in his own urine a pep talk, a hug wouldn't be forthcoming. I couldn't figure out what to do about it, so I did nothing. I could feel myself slipping, becoming one of those people that others either humor, or attack. Insane.
    


I heard a gust of wind tear across the field beside me, so closing myself into a ball to minimize surface area I braced for the impact. When it hit me, I was positive it was gale force and it brought with it a world of painful cold.



My ears felt it first, burning to begin with, and then feeling like millions of needles were stabbing into them, all the way into the ear canal. 



Then my face and my chapped lips felt like the skin had just been ripped off, exposing the tender tissue below, and now cold working in concert with my dehydration had cemented my lips together. 



Although my hands had seemed to be burning constantly, at the same time a kind of pain radiated through them that I had never felt before, something as foreign as another planet, like a solar system had placed it there, and moving my fingers was now a monumental and agonizing task. My whole body shook and spasmed in defiance of the cold.
    



""Fuuuuuuccckkkkkkk!"". 
    


At the top of my lungs I let it go. In spite of being ultra noise conscious of the condominiums two hundred yards behind me, I couldn't help myself. But it was clear that even if they had the windows open, they wouldn't have heard me over the howling of the wind. 
     


The only way I would be able to save myself at this point would be to swing around the chain link fence that extended over the concrete wall with a nasty twenty foot fall to the cement spillway below. That fall was a guaranteed serious injury. It was a harsh punishment for not taking my entrance way seriously, or trying to come visiting while shitfaced drunk. 



I had already seen the physics of that scene play out, ending in two broken ankles and a collarbone. A death-defying trapeze act without the precaution of a net. I was positive that my hands would not be able to keep an adequate grip on the fence to hold my body weight. I couldn't even make a tight fist. 
     


If I were to somehow manage the swing around the fence, then I would have to navigate the obstacle course of hidden ditches and bare thorned briar bushes in the pitch black to get to the road for help. About a hundred yards of booby traps.
    


And, where would I go then? I probably hadn't heard three cars go over the bridge in the last hour and a half. If  miraculously a car did come by, what's the chances they would have stopped for me? Who was going to let a nasty, pissed soaked piece of shit like me get in their vehicle? 



'You would rather die than go to the hospital like this' the voice of my shame was repeating to me, over and over again, until I guess I just accepted it as the rule. The Gods honest truth.
    


No. If I was going to choose life, then the battle would be fought right here, on my turf, my homefield advantage. Fuck getting help. I could do this better, easier on my own, with only me in command. I hated how you had to give up control of yourself at the hospital it seemed, and all too often to people that I was positive had cheated their way through medical school. 
    


I had no idea which way to go for help anyway. At that very time, I couldn't remember if it was left into town at the closest road, or if it was right. I had walked the path to the B.P. so many times I could do it asleep, but my brain injury had clearly chosen to spray my situation down with some good old fashioned confusion, just to make things a little sportier, I guessed.
    


So, the decision now was to fight, to rage against the dying of the light, and to do it right here in my own yard.
    


My watch read three am, about four more hours until the sun would cascade life over this part of the world, four more hours in the ring with Ali. Nothing to it. I come from a long line of tough motherfuckers. A grandfather who fought in the Pacific during World War Two, at the same time, halfway around the world, another fighting the Third Reich hoping to reach Berlin before the Red Tide. 




It occurred to me as a child, that due to time zones, there was an ancestor of mine fighting twenty four hours a day against the evil that you could read all about and still never grasp the depravity. I thought about my moms dad, over in Belgium during the Bulge, thirty below, inadequate winter clothes, gloves with holes, and two clips left for his M1 Garand, outnumbered a hundred to one, but standing defiantly for what was right. 



""Goddam, at least no one is shooting at me. Come on grandad, be with me.""
    


I was going to live. I was not going to be found dead under some bridge, my body just another piece of litter with all the rest of the trash. 
    


Nobody was going to find my piss covered carcass by following the foul stench carried to them on the breeze of a spring thaw.
    


My body was now in a constant state of spasm, uncontrollably shaking, and I could feel the soreness of muscles contracting over and over and I thought of Micheal J. Fox and found a laugh. An actual gut laugh. It made me feel stronger instantly. No matter what, I had to laugh. If I could laugh, then I was in control of this situation. Rarely do you hear the loser laughing, always the victor.
    


I tried to think of my folks. Tried to recall some family moment, maybe on vacation or some happy occasion, a time that can always be conjured to the mind to elicit a laugh at pauses of family reunion conversations. 



All I could think of was sitting in the backseat of my dads 1972 SuperBeetle on the way back to Tennessee from Kansas, where my sister was living the bad biker chick lifestyle. One of her lovers was an acid dealer, and he laid twenty hits of some really nice Sunshine on me, two of which I had dropped an hour before stopping at the store in a severe case of time mismanagement. 




My dad parked the car and asked me if I wanted to get out and go in for something, and I barely managed a ""no"" through my unabashed laughter at the mere idea. For the last fifteen minutes, my vocabulary had become uninhibited and Pops had called me down for dropping the f word so many times that he had become agitated, he absolutely hated that word and would not permit it. Something my mom thought was more and more comedic with every Coors she could put down. 



When Pops went into the store, I leaned up and said in her ear, ""You know what? Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck....."" nonstop until my father emerged from the store. By the time he got to the car, my mom had laughed so hard that she peed a little. 



My dads authoritative facade completely broke, and he joined in. A little bug with three people and a little black dog sitting in the parking lot of some small store somewhere in Arkansas laughing uncontrollably for half an hour at least. I laughed a little at the memory then looked at my watch. 
    


Shit! It was after four am now, three and a half hours before something close opened. I was becoming exhausted now from all the energy expended by the spasms, compounded by malnutrition and on the line of dehydration, my energy was draining fast. 



It started to look like this one may come down to a war of time attrition. ""Me and you tick tock. Let's do this,"" I said out loud to no one but myself.
    


I figured that now was as good of a time as any to try and put something out to the Universe, the Cosmic Karma, time to try and play 'Let's Make A Deal' with the hands of fate. 



""This is my word. If I make it to the other side of this, if I live through this night, I will make it off the streets and when I do, I will do anything in my power to help who I can. This is my word."" I figured since I said it with my best Dances With Wolves imitation that it would carry more weight, a concept that amused me and made me wonder if a Native American could overrule the prayer of a White Christian since the Native would be speaking straight to the big man. 



I've long regarded Nature as God. Fits the bill, and here I was having thoughts that would probably make Bible God mad if he was real. 



Then, the internal comedian of mine took the stage, thankfully he was hot tonight and I started rolling. It all of a sudden occurred to me that he only came out when I was in that space between semi-asleep and asleep . It just then occurred to me that I might be dead.
     


I snapped awake and was shivering all over, the intensity of the spasms were making my legs and arms hurt and burn. I could feel the coldness inside of me as if my bones were made of ice, cooling the meat covering. 



I had to get up and walk, and at this point, I wasn't sure if I could. My balance still wasn't perfect, and my legs hurt. Nonetheless, I managed to stand with the help of a pillar, then started to walk in place and turning around scanning the area. 



A large piece of cardboard had been blown against the outside of the fencing, effectively blocking the wind. I got my stuff and headed for it. Sitting down in the corner I found I was able to shift the cardboard with my fingers to its optimum position, then I piled everything I could find on top of me. 



I balled up underneath and shivered. I pictured me frozen solid all balled up, stuck to the frozen fence and some schmuck accidentally bumps the fence knocking the balled up frozen corpse of me loose, and I roll down the hill and into the spillway then clean out of sight. The more I tried to picture that, the funnier it got until some laughs busted loose.
    


By six, I could feel some warmth building back up so I decided to make my way to the store. This meant being fully exposed to the wind, which was showing signs of boredom now, like this gig ain't worth the energy. 
    


When I arrived at the station, it wasn't open yet, but the owner was already there and  was getting all set up for opening that day when he saw me. He called to me as I was trying to find a place to block the wind, and I turned to see him standing in the front door motioning for me to come over there and into the store. 
    


""You don't look so good,"" he matter of fact told me. He was from Pakistan, and he spoke straight to the point. 
    


""Yeah. I don't feel so good either.""
    


""You look terrible.""
    


I could feel it coming, that gut laugh that you know there is no stopping.
    


""I will get the coffee going for you. You must get warm. Why did you pee in your pants?""
     


That was it. I bent in half laughing. As a big deal of a deal, those pants were yesterday, after last night, that seemed to be the least of my worries. 



Maybe it's all in perspective. 



And they say that your perspective tends to change when you feel the chill Nor'eastern blow.

1fuzzuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/paypigsupportgroup/comments/1fuzzuk/natural_or_by_design/,Natural or by Design? ,"I had known my Mistress for several months before I took the first step in submitting to Her. When She first approached me I couldn't even send yet despite that we talked in DMs, not often but every week or so. Whenever She posted I would retweet and often that led Her to asking how I was and perhaps give me a gentle tease. Then one day I was having a problem and She was there for me. She was so supportive that without Her bidding I sent Her a coffee as a thank You. With that coffee I effectively became Her finsub, and from that moment on it felt natural to continue sending to Her with the money flowing from this wallet to Her account ever since. It did not take long before I was exclusively sending to Mistress, and became Her owned slave. Around 9 months ago She sent me a collar and my submission was complete. 

The development since then has been constant and continues to this day. From the start I have been given a drone like persona and so the progression that we have had has been characterised as a brainwash, as my mind being rewritten so that I am compliant in every way. The vast majority of detail comes from my Mistress, but any ideas I might have inspired by Her are sometimes adapted intoThe System She created too. 

There have been ups and downs. It's certainly not been perfect, but nothing long term ever is. Mistress's Domination of me feels perfectly natural and yet there has been a lot of effort designing just how She controls me. Daily mantras, regular reports, running targets and constant small sends all ensure She is never far from my mind. And whenever She messages me I light up. Even if it is bad news it is manageable because She told me. She can instantaneously trigger me into deep submission begging to send more for Her. She has me constantly looking forward to what She does next. Last night there was  yet another development and it excites me to see where this takes us next. 

This all feels so natural. It feels as if has organically grown from the connection we had from the start. And though I know much thought, time and effort went into training me I do think it actually was supposed to be. However, for the enjoyment of it we both often imagine that this was all in Her Plan from the start. Luring me in with friendship, planting the seeds of submission in pleasant banter, springing the trap with that coffee, brainwash and mindf*ck stepped up to ensure obsession, slavery and devotion. All part of Her Evil design to make me the helpless drone I am today, eager to send and please Her in any way possible.

It's well into the afternoon of 1st day, here and this is the first time in years I have felt kind of ""yuck"" about doing nothing on chaggim. We usually do a family dinner on chaggim but this year, for a variety of reasons, we were not able to even do that on 1st night, so I've done nothing at all to mark the day. 

I am at work. Very few people here even know I am Jewish and it's very, very left leaning organisation, where Israel is seen as ""the bad guy"", without question. I usually just come to work, do what I need to, and keep to myself, as much as one can at work. I don't talk about my private life with people.

However, with all that's happening in Israel, I am feeling really unpleasant about being at work. I want news and updates on what's happening. I want to know the people I care for in Israel (and everyone else) are safe. I want to *talk* about it - but I can't. It's ""Jewish New Year"", our people are in horrible danger and not one person around me even knows or cares. 

It's weird. I don't want to go back to being frum. I can't go back to Shule or that life, and I don't want to - but at times like this, I feel especially alone and just needing to talk to someone about what is happening and have them care and there's kind of ....no one.... to do that with, except here.

So that's it.

In the past naging dahilan ng break up namin yung paninigaw nya at pag babato ng gamit sa sahig dahil natrigger sya sa convo namin night before my bday. Eventually we got back together at nasabi ko sa kanyang pag naulit pa uli yung paninigaw at panduduro nya hindi ko na yun itotolerate. Naghiwalay kami dahil sa anger issues nya pero sabi nya babawi daw sya kaya nanliligaw uli. 

Dahil sa nature ng work ko before at sa mga personal reasons sometimes kapag nag hyper focus ako sa isang bagay wala na ko naririnig sa paligid ko. 

Fast forward 1 year later nagpunta kami sa starbucks para mag coffee. After drinking coffee sabi nya gusto nya mag poop sa cr ng SB kaso maraming tao. Sabi ko sa kanya, antay tayo onti. Few minutes later less busy na si sb so he got the chance to go sa cr. Lowbatt phone ko at no data. so I borrowed his phone to play Piano Tiles. Few minutes later, habang nasa mabilis na kong part ng game he came back at nag aaya na umalis sa sb. 

I said ""wait lang, tapusin ko lang to."" 
Inulit nya, ""tara na alis na tayo"". 
 
I wanna complete a certain level kaya focused parin ako, kaya sabi ko ""wait"". 

Inulit nya ""tara na nga"" this time iritable na. Medyo confused na ko bakit sya iritable so sabi ko ""pindutin mo nga yung lock button (habang naglalaro pa) para ma-pause yung game. (Inaabot ko sa kanya phone while smiling)"" no response.
  
I looked up to see na galit na sya. I turned off the game and said ""bakit?"", 
he said angrily ""kanina pa ko nag aaya umalis dito inuuna mo pa yang laro mo!!"" sabay walk out sa sb while I follow along. Sobrang confused na ko kasi normal lang naman samin mag-game sa phone while waiting for the other person. At nag aantayan talaga kami para tapusin yung nilalaro namin. Di rin tumagal ng 1 minute yung interaction namin bago sya mag walk out. 

I asked uli, ""ano meron?"", he replied pagalit ""sabi ko tara na ayaw mo pang tumayo. kanina pa ko aya ng aya napapahiya na ko dun"". 

Sobrang confused ako at that time, which resulted sa pagka-inis at nag translate yun sa muka ko. In my mind, ""bakit galit na galit ka na dahil di ako tumayo agad?"". Kita nya sa muka ko na nakakunot noo ko habang nakasunod lang ako sa kanya and he said ""tara na uwi na tayo"". We weren't talking on our way home. 

Pag baba ng tricycle at pag pasok namin ng bahay, that's where he went off. 
""KANINA PA KO AYA NG AYA SAYO UMALIS DI KA TUMATAYO INUUNA MO PA YANG TANGINANG LARO NA YAN"" 
""Di mo alam hiyang hiya ako dun?!?!?! GUSTONG GUSTO MO KO NAPAPAHIYA NO""  
At this point mas lalo na kong nainis. Kasi bakit ka galit na galit kasi di ako tumayo agad? Sa 3 years natin ngayon lang naging big deal to. Sabi ko ng mahinahon ""ano problema mo? Dahil di ako tumayo agad??"" Pero iritable itsura ko. 

""Baka mas galit ka pa nyan sakin ha? INIINVALIDATE MO FEELINGS KO?""
Me: ""ano nga problema?""
""SERYOSO KA DI MO ALAM? HIYANG HIYA AKO DUN. WALA KANG PAKIELAM.""
""KANINA PA KO NAG SASABI TARA NA TARA NA. GINAWA MO KONG TANGA DUN. ANTAY AKO NG ANTAY""

Di na ko nag salita. I was trembling. Di ko alam sa galit ba, confusion, or ewan. Nasa corner lang kami, yung mga dogs ko nakatago sa likod ko, takot. Rinig ng buong compound yung paninigaw. Tumigil sya sa paninigaw at umakyat. 

Nag chat na ko sa mom ko na uuwi na ko para iexpect nya ko. 

Umakyat ako sa kwarto kung san sya nag pahinga. Nag log out ako ng accounts ko sa phone nya. Sabi ko sa kanya:

Me: ""Sorry di ako tumayo agad. Di ko alam bat ka galit na galit dahil dun pero humihingi ako ng pasensya sa actions ko."" 
Ex: ""Seryoso ka di mo alam dahilan?""
Me: ""hindi ko alam bakit ka galit na galit kasi di ako tumayo agad pero sorry""

Natawa sya, side smirk, scoffed. ""Nag cr ako sa SB. Walang bidet. Ang baho ng tae ko dun. Pag labas ko cr may dalawang taong nakapila. Hiyang hiya ako. Inaaya kita umalis ayaw mo tumayo. Laro ka ng laro.""

Atp ako yung meme na ""???"". I said ""di mo sinabi yan sakin?"" Sabi nya ""Kasi di ka nakikinig"".  I took my bag, he asked me san ako pupunta. Sabi ko uuwi na ko. Bago ako bumaba sabi ko in my trembling voice 

""pasensya ka na, hindi ko alam na yan pala yung dahilan mo. wala akong narinig na yan pala yung dahilan—"" 
""kasi inuuna mo yang laro kesa saki—""
""believe me, kung nalaman kong yan pala dahilan ako pa naunang umalis sa SB. Hinding hindi ko sasadyain na magstay para mapahiya ka lalo."" 

Desidido na ko umuwi. Nung pababa na ko sabi nya ""wag ka na umuwi okay na ko. maghahabulan pa ba tayo?"" I insisted na uuwi na ko kahit anong mangyari. Pinipilit nya kong wag na umuwi pero buo na loob ko. He even said ""sorry nanigaw ako. wag ka na umuwi."" Pero I left. 

Nung nakauwi na ko he called me so many times pero di ako sumagot. Few hours later nag long message sya sakin na titigil na daw sya sa panliligaw sakin at madami daw syang narerealize. Kaya sorry daw sa unfulfilled promises. 1 month later no contact parin ako and he never resolved things with me. Lately sya rin lumalabas na victim sa family & friends nya.

1fuzplz,https://www.reddit.com/r/retailhell/comments/1fuzplz/wheres_the_hot_water/,"""Where's the hot water?""","This is a question I get asked at my store all the time. I work third shift at a gas station along the interstate. Our ""coffee area"" as we call it, has everything you'd need for hot drinks or food. And we have it set up so simple for people so they'd know where everything is. 

For context, this is how we have it set up. We have a counter dedicated solely to drinks and hot water. On the very left of the counter is the slurpee machine. Next to it is the cappuccino machine, then there's the 6 coffee pots. Then on the very right of that counter is our Franke machine. If you're familiar with them, they're those instant coffee machines that have 3 coffee bean containers on the top and have a touchscreen you can use. These machines also allow customers to get hot water in case they want to make soup. We also offer a microwave for customers as well. 

Anyways, you'd think customers wouldn't have a hard time finding the Franke machine for their hot water needs. But it seems they do.. Every single night, I get 1 - 3 customers who ask me that infamous question.. ""Where's the hot water?""

I don't usually mind this question. It can be a little tricky finding it if the Franke's screen isn't swiped to the hot water display. So I usually answer these customers like this.

""You're gonna want the machine on the very right of the counter, next to our coffee pots. It's the counter with the coffees and cappuccino machine. Just swipe left on the screen and you'll see hot water.""

Is this explanation enough for them? Not at all. They'll stand there and stare at the counter aimlessly, like a lost puppy. Then after staring for a moment, they look at me and say ""I don't see it..""

Of course, I need to try and explain it better to them. So I start to actually point at the Franke machine and tell them ""It's the machine on the very right of the counter. Has the screen on it and the blue light.""

Is this enough for them? Hell no! For some reason, as if they never learned the difference between right and left, they start to GRAVITATE TOWARDS THE LEFT OF THE COUNTER TOWARDS THE CAPPUCCINO MACHINE. 

I have to step in and say ""No, it's on the RIGHT of the counter. The RIGHT."" On a very rare instance, this is enough, but majority of the time, it isn't. They'll either continue to gravitate towards the cappuccino machine, or they'll touch one of the coffee pots and look at me with that dumb face.. 

9 times out of 10, I need to drop everything I'm doing at my register, whether that be tending to a customer, making a money drop in the safe, or organizing the register area, just to walk over to that damn Franke machine and PHYSICALLY TOUCH it in order for them to understand that ""Hey! There's actually a machine here besides the coffee pots and the cappuccino machine!"" 

You'd think it stops there, but no. Of course it doesn't. They can't figure out how a touchscreen works. They stare at the screen, which says at the very bottom ""swipe left for hot water."" Either I explain to them to swipe left on the screen and they start either pressing the coffee options, or they start swiping RIGHT.. So of course I need to show them how a touchscreen works..

What the hell is wrong with people? How have some of these specimens make it this far in life without knowing how a touchscreen works.. Without knowing what the difference between left and right is.. Without understanding a very detailed answer to their question.. They're obviously not completely braindead considering they're traveling the turnpike and understand road signs...

When she and I first started dating 2 years ago, she was kind of lazy. She did work a 9-5 job, but it was a pretty simple and easy job. I know that because that's where we met. That's about all she did. She worked and slept. She would go to sleep by 1AM and 4 days out of the week she'd start her shift at 9AM. She'd go home and repeat the process until the weekend, where she'd sleep until 3PM-5PM and then just hang out in bed. Every single week this was her schedule. This was a bit of a problem, because the area in which we live snows heavily 6-8 months out of the year. At the beginning of our relationship, she was living with her parents who never pushed her to do anything, and didn't care what she did. I moved from my hometown in with my parents for about 5 months so I could get back on my feet in the new area. She would come over and stay with me 3-5 nights a week every week in the winter season. Where my parents' house is gets VERY heavy snow and requires relatively constant maintenance from morning 'til late evening. My parents and I would get up early in the morning and plow the driveway, take turns shoveling, putting on chains, and repeat in the evening. Mind you, this is JUST so you're able to leave the house. She would be in bed while all of us are busting our balls. I expressed my frustration about how it seemed as if she was taking advantage of me and my parents. While we're outside sweating in the middle of winter completely bundled up, she'd be in the warm house drinking coffee watching TikTok. This never changed, so my parents didn't allow her to stay for more than 2 nights out of the week because they felt it was unfair to them, which I totally understood.

We have since moved into our own apartment and have been here for little over a year. Things were changing (kind of). She was lightly doing things around the house (after I begged her for help for months), did most of the cooking, and would help me on cleaning days 2 days out of the month. Recently this last month, she has started staying up until 4-5AM most nights/mornings, and then wakes up for work at about 8:30AM, works until 5PM and then comes home and IMMEDIATELY gets in bed until she falls asleep. She'll then wake up anywhere from 9PM-11PM and repeat the process. I have explained to her how bad this is for her sleep schedule, I have encouraged her to start setting alarms for 1.5 hours TOPS, and I have expressed how concerned I am for her mental and physical health. No matter what, nothing changes. She does not care. This is beginning to affect me. I have started going to bed by 1AM at the LATEST. I'm constantly woken up and disrupted by her showering, turning on the TV, watching YouTube videos, turning on the lights and/or using the kitchen. Mind you, we're in a small 1 bed, 1 bath apartment. Again, I expressed my feelings and my concerns about her habits and nothing is changing. I've encouraged her to start going to the gym with me. I have encouraged her to go on walks with me. I encourage her to go on hikes with me on the weekends, which she says she wants to do, but she won't even wake herself up at a time in which we could still go.

Lastly, she has deeply hated her job pretty much since she started it, and blames all of this on hating the state in which we live and hating her job. She works 36-38 hours a week making $16/hr and constantly complains about how broke we are and how ""little time"" she has. She has very basic adult responsibilities and it crushes her. She has just recently started looking for a new job, but every job she's ever had, she's either been fired from, she hates or she gets burned out after 6 months. I want her to feel accomplished and I want her to feel empowered, loved and supported but she doesn't really have any drive or dedication. I sometimes feel like I'm dating a girl, when I want to date a woman.

What are things I can say? She wants to change her situation, but won't do the things it takes to do so. I want to empower her to want the best for herself. How can I, as her partner, encourage her to be a better version of herself and grow past these childish habits?",2,1727929534.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

It has 1-shot and 2-shot preset buttons, which I never use. There's also a milk steamer, but the wand feels too short and the steam is sputtery. Fortunately it has a manual start/stop button, which is enough to make espresso according to weight.

The first few months resulted in many bad shots and wasted coffee. 🤮 It took a while, but these past few weeks I've settled on a workflow that generally results in pleasant coffee:

Accessories used:

* Commandante X25 grinder
* 51mm bottomless portafilter with 2-shot basket
* 51mm dosing funnel
* WDT tool
* 51mm self-leveling tamper
* 51mm paper filters
* 51mm puck screen

The workflow:

1. Dose 14-16.5g, grind size 7-9 clicks depending on the beans
2. Paper filter at the bottom of the basket, plop the ground beans, agitate with WDT tool, tamp, another paper filter on top, and finally drop the puck screen.
3. Target yield is 1:2 ratio, slightly higher/lower depending on the beans or how I felt about yesterday's coffee.
4. Timer starts at the first drop, and stops when I reach the target yield. I'm satisfied if it's anywhere around 30-40 seconds.

The paper filter sandwich has been a HUGE help! As long as the beans are good, this gives me yummy espresso that I can enjoy straight out of the cup. It also yields mostly consistent results. Sometimes I have a lopsided puck, and I will see that as soon as the extraction emerges underneath the basket, but the output is still usually delicious.

So here's my question. Because I'm currently happy with this workflow and the espresso it makes. Are there flavors or qualities of espresso that I can only unlock by getting a better machine?",0,1727929463.0,espresso,4,0.5,False
