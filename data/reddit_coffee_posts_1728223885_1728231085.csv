I'm looking to buy my first coffee grinder soon and need some advice. From my research it seems that at this price point my best bet is a manual grinder. (Although please say if you disagree).
I'm looking at 2 potential options currently, which are the MHW-3BOMBER R3 and the TIMEMORE C3 ESP PRO. Both seem to have quite good reviews. 
I've got an aeropress currently so I'd like to be able to use it with that for now but continue using it when I get an espresso machine (which I plan to do soon). 
I'm thinking a budget of about £150 (GBP) but I can be flexible to a degree, and I'd be willing to spend a bit more to get something that will work great into the future as well as I develop my skills with the espresso machine. 
Any thoughts on the 2 grinders I've suggested or alternative recommendations would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks! ",1,1728230849.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall and spooky season.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to stay active, and exercise daily. [This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/5vxkZTv)


A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+. Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something super serious, nor am I looking to relocate or anything like that. 

If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Tell me a bit about yourself! I will ignore any single word responses - “hey” does not start a conversation. ",1,1728230786.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

1fxjxj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1fxjxj4/my_f39_boyfriend_m39_of_5_years_is_increasingly/,My (F39) boyfriend (M39) of 5 years is increasingly self-centered. How do I handle?,"We started out with him being very considerate, kind and attentive and I was attracted to the kindness and willingness to work things out and consider me. He spends most of his free time at my place and doesn't contribute for food, expenses or with housekeeping.

In the last year or so, he started shifting from kind to rude or disrespectful and became increasingly self-centered. In the last few weeks, his self-centeredness hit a new high. He would wake up at my place, make himself a coffee, tell me how he feels then leave. For days on end. No interest in me of making me a cup too. He would eat all the snacks in my house and not even ask about replacing them. Yesterday he bought himself a bottle of Coke which I found empty in the middle of my kitchen table this morning. He didn't offer me any nor did he put the empty bottle away. When he has a moment of free time, he goes out and does sports or hangs out with his friends, regardless of how little time we have to spend together. He once admitted that spending time with me doesn't cross his mind in those situations. When I try to do the sport he likes, his entire focus is to beat me even if I'm doing it for the 1st time.

When I say something (with kind communication, using I feel statements, ...), he accuses me of making him feel like an idiot with increased frequency. Last time I brought it up he said he is unaware of doing it and that he will try to improve. He was back to it the next day. When I said I thought I was coming down with something, his only comment was :""I hope not, I have stuff to do and can't afford to get sick.""

His life has never been more stable and calm than now and he swears he couldn't be happier in the relationship, that I am the most important person in his life and that he doesn't intend to hurt me. And yet I am feeling more and more disregarded, alone and angry. I woke up this morning to have him tell me that before I woke up he arranged to meet up with a female colleague for a work project and is leaving right away. He said ""I am sorry"" and my answer was ""no, you're not."" He then replied ""well, this is how it is, I need to get something ready for work."" They could have met any other day.

I really don't know what to do anymore. It feels like the only wants and needs he considers are his. Any advice is welcome.

It's an incredibly journey honesty as I've met a lot of wonderful people so far and the curriculum is just great. But at the same time, I've been struggling so much despite it being only the beginning. Due to certain circumstances, I chose to commute to university instead of living at accomodation. My current home location makes this feesible. However because of this, I rarely get the opportunity to go out and meet people. As someone who's teen years were wasted away by the covid-19 pandemic and due to strict parents, I find it difficult to make connections/friends. I always get good grades and try my best to help out with chores and my younger siblings as much as I can but it genuinely feels like I have no life. I'm 18 yet I still feel beyond nervous to go out for long or just ask if I can go anywhere. And recently, this all just made me breakdown after I met this guy at a society. I don't wish to disclose much details as I don't want my identity to be revealed but my god, I found him really cute. Do you ever just get that yearning feeling to get to know someone? You become so curious that you just want to befriend them and talk with them? But because I'm commute to university, I just don't have the chance to interact with him. I always have to leave early to catch transport and it's just genuinely dangerous to use public transport at night as a woman in my city. And afterall, most societies tend to hold events in the evening which almost makes it impossible for me to do anything. So.. I tried to get to know him through text. I've never felt so nervous to reach out to someone but I tried nevertheless and making some simple conversations. And while he would respond, the interactions felt one way, the effort only coming from me. This interaction, the inability of meeting people at university and everything else just made me breakdown and cry. If you know the phrase ""a pig with makeup"" then you might understand how I have felt. I really don't know what to do anymore. I've considered simply telling him ""I'm curious about you and wish to get to know you more"" or ask to go out for coffee like typical adults would do but it's terrifying. I'm scared I'll seem pathetic for putting in effort and time for someone who could care less, that I'll look like an idiot or just ruin any opportunities for a friendship with him. Or maybe I'm overthinking it all? This society is the only one I've felt remotely comfortable in and try to be committed to. He's a key member of the society so what I'll choose to do might affect it all. I've never had the exposure like others had while meeting people, going out to parties or doing anything remotely fun with people their age. It's so frustrating and the experience of university is becoming bleaker by day due to all of this. Am I just overthinking it all? Should I just say that and get it out of my mind despite the risks of it? What can I do to actually make connections with people while commuting? Any advice or opinion would be really appreciated.",1,1728230702.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Without the boost, I didn’t have the energy to go out last night and do what I wanted to do. I asked for an extension on an assignment for a class I’m taking on top of work, i haven’t asked for once in years. We have a big deadline at the end of the month at my work which is sapping my strength and we agreed to pretend we didn’t break up and go to my friend’s wedding in two weeks to make things easier on some of my other friends. Today I laid in bed watching Crazy Ex-Girlfriend after seeing I got the extension, and I’m finally out of bed and getting myself a stupidly overpriced coffee (yeah it’s pumpkin spice I’m basic whatever lol) and readying myself for a game with my sports team and my remaining parent’s 60th.

1. There is no need to buy any pre paid cards or passes if you don’t want to for the trains. I just bought physical tickets at the stations that I went to and honestly I preferred that. Line wasn’t long and I just paid exactly the amount needed to get to where I wanted

2. Don’t stress about restaurants. Unless you have a specific place in mind that you want to try out, you can pretty much walk into any restaurant you want and the chances are the food is good. I had the best curry in a random place in Harajuku 

3. Shinkansen tickets can be bought 20 min before the train arrives in the station, so don’t stress about booking it beforehand. I recommend Nozomi trains from Tokyo to Kyoto/Osaka. They skip all the non major stations. Unless you want to stop at all the stations for the scenery.

4. Always carry cash, this was mentioned many times on this subreddit, but a lot of smaller restaurants only take cash. 

5. Don’t book too many things on the same day. One of the most enjoyable things I did in Tokyo/Kyoto/Osaka was just grabbing a drink or coffee and people watching.

6. Make sure to go to a rooftop observatory in Tokyo during the night time. The way the buildings light up with the red lights in Tokyo during the night is breathtaking.

1fxjr8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dr_KhushbooSoni/comments/1fxjr8a/effectiveness_of_home_remedies_for_dental_care/,Effectiveness of Home Remedies for Dental Care 🦷,"Home remedies for dental care have gained popularity as natural alternatives to conventional treatments. However, understanding their effectiveness is crucial for making informed decisions about your oral health. Let's break down the effectiveness of some common home remedies and how they can fit into your overall dental care routine! 🌟💬

# 1. Baking Soda 🥄

* **What It Does:** Baking soda is a mild abrasive that helps remove surface stains and neutralizes acids in the mouth.
* **Effectiveness:**
   * **Whitening:** It can effectively whiten teeth by removing surface stains from coffee, tea, and other foods.
   * **Cleaning:** Regular use can help maintain oral hygiene by reducing plaque buildup. However, overuse can lead to enamel wear.

# 2. Coconut Oil Pulling 🥥

* **What It Does:** This practice involves swishing coconut oil in the mouth to eliminate bacteria and promote oral health.
* **Effectiveness:**
   * **Plaque Reduction:** Some studies indicate that oil pulling can reduce plaque and improve gum health, but it’s not a substitute for brushing and flossing.
   * **Breath Freshness:** Users often report fresher breath after regular oil pulling sessions.

# 3. Apple Cider Vinegar 🍏

* **What It Does:** Known for its antibacterial properties, apple cider vinegar is believed to help whiten teeth and reduce plaque.
* **Effectiveness:**
   * **Stain Removal:** It can help remove some surface stains, but its acidity poses a risk to enamel erosion if used frequently.
   * **Caution Needed:** It's crucial to dilute it with water and limit usage to avoid damaging teeth.

# 4. Turmeric 🌼

* **What It Does:** Turmeric has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties that can benefit oral health.
* **Effectiveness:**
   * **Gum Health:** It may reduce inflammation and support gum health, but its effectiveness as a teeth whitener lacks strong scientific evidence.
   * **Staining Potential:** Turmeric can stain teeth, so it’s important to use it with caution and rinse thoroughly afterward.

# 5. Saltwater Rinse 🧂

* **What It Does:** A warm saltwater rinse is often used to soothe irritated gums and promote healing.
* **Effectiveness:**
   * **Gum Health:** Highly effective for reducing inflammation and discomfort, particularly after dental procedures or for minor irritations.
   * **Bacterial Control:** It can help kill bacteria and promote oral hygiene, making it a valuable adjunct to regular brushing.

# Conclusion: Weighing the Effectiveness of Home Remedies 🤔✨

Home remedies can provide supportive benefits for dental care, such as whitening, plaque reduction, and soothing oral discomfort. However, their effectiveness varies, and they should not replace standard dental practices. Here are some key takeaways:

* **Supplemental Use:** Home remedies are best used as supplements to a regular oral hygiene routine, not as replacements for professional care.
* **Caution Required:** Be aware of potential risks, such as enamel erosion or staining, and use remedies in moderation.
* **Consult Professionals:** Always consult your dentist before trying new home remedies, especially if you have existing dental conditions.

While home remedies can offer some benefits, nothing replaces the expertise and preventive care provided by dental professionals. Prioritize your oral health with a balanced approach that includes both home care and professional treatment! 🦷💖",1,1728230312.0,u_Dr_KhushbooSoni,0,1.0,False

The thought of doing so just paralyzed me. And also I had never found anyone I genuinely liked before, but that changed recently. I met this girl a while ago and I always felt like we got along well but recently we’ve spent a lot of time together and I’ve really started to like her. 

I really want to ask her out, but I don’t know how, I’m not even sure if she likes me back. I requested to follow her on instagram yesterday but she hasn’t accepted. I don’t know if that’s a good or a bad sign. 

But mainly, I don’t know how to approach her, I don’t know if I should but if I do t do it this weekend I don’t know how long it’s going to be until I have the chance again. 

I’ve asked for advice to my friends and they all say the same thing, that I should approach her quietly and confidently and ask her out for a coffee or something like that. But I guess no one knows more about girls than girls, so I’d really appreciate any advice you can give me. ",1,1728230159.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

1fxjorl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1fxjorl/are_you_taking_vyvanse/,Are you taking Vyvanse?,"I was diagnosed a few months ago and started on Ritalin, 10 mg twice a day is what I got up to, but I felt no change on it. So, I asked to try Vyvanse.
I’m at a starting dose of 30 mg a day and have been on that for about a month. I felt an immediate difference. I could focus and it has been great for studying! It lasts maybe four hours though and then I get tired. I think it’s supposed to last 12-14 hours.

Here’s my issue, at first, I drank my two cups of coffee a day, but my prescriber recommended I cut out all coffee with stimulants. I was able to get down to half a cup of coffee a day. I need my coffee because it’s part of my morning routine which cannot (because I refuse to change it) be changed. What I have found, is that with only half a cup of coffee, I can’t focus well even after taking Vyvanse. So, I upped my coffee intake back to two cups (I use to drink 3-4 before stimulants). I can now focus again.

Does this mean I need a higher dose of Vyvanse? My prescriber said in a month she’s probably up my dose to 40mg, but a month seems like a long time! Being able to focus is super important for me right now. I am able to retain so much information now while on it plus my 2-cups of coffee. Without it, my brain wants to do everything, but focus on studying.

I know everyone is different, but it would be nice to hear experiences of others!

I know this post is long for what I needed to say, but I feel like it’s something my ASD side needs in order to feel like all the info is out there so I’m understood clearly.",3,1728230128.0,AuDHDWomen,5,1.0,False

> NOTE: This is not a thread about salt-free conditioners vs traditional softeners. <

One of the systems I've been considering uses citric acid...

[https://nuvoh2o.com/manor-duo-systems/](https://nuvoh2o.com/manor-duo-systems/)

Citric acid is bad for tooth enamel. We drink a lot of water. Doesn't the citric acid remain in the water after passing through this type of system? I'm guessing it does and that's the reason why they can make the claim that it may help remove existing calcium buildup (citric acid is often used to clean coffee machines). But if the citric acid remains, why doesn't anyone mention the potential for tooth decay? (Never mind ruining the concrete in your garage or the lovely epoxy floor coating if you should spill the solution on it when changing filters.)

Another system that I've considered uses a ""proprietary"" polyphosphate blend...

  
[https://cascadianwater.com/products/ics-stp](https://cascadianwater.com/products/ics-stp)

Not a lot of info on that system. Seems everyone is peddling a ""proprietary"" concoction of some sort or another. They do have filter housings with a drain at the bottom which is pretty convenient (if you know, you know) but their replacement filters are $500/yr vs Nuvo which (for the Manor system) run about $330/yr (if changed every 6 months).

I know there are many systems out there, I'm trying to focus on the above two systems right now since there is also a ton of noise with everyone claiming their system is better than some other system plus a lot of DIY'ers not understanding zilch about filters, filter care, limitations between systems, etc., and then posting negative reviews.",1,1728230044.0,WaterTreatment,0,1.0,False

I followed the recipe but used skim milk vs almond as skim just always produces a better overall quality for me. I also added 1/8 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp coffee powder for flavor. It was rich with a great firm consistency but it just a bit gritty/chalky. 

So I did the exact same thing but made a few tweaks:

* Lowered the cocoa powder to 3 Tablespoons (25g) (it was a bit TOO intense) 
* Added 1/4 tsp CMC and 1/8 tsp Tara gum for creaminess
* Added 1 tsp lecithin, also for creamines 

And, not surprisingly it WAS better (but I expect most of you won't got to these extreme) My wife felt that even THIS version was too chalky.

So I as a base, I went back to my base standard:

* 1/5 cup skim milk
* 1/2 cup greek yogurt
* 1/3 cup chocolate protein powder (kirkland brand)
* 1/4 cup allulose
* 2 Tablespoons Cocoa powder (16g)
* 1/4 tsp CMC and 1/8 tsp Tara gum

This was a BIG hit. Much creamier with more of a soft serve consistency. This really bother the 'mad scientist' in me as the kirkland protein powder is a 'black box'. I'm going to try it again with a mix if casein and whey to see if I can break it down.

Last year (from December to January) I was hanging out with this guy that I had crush on for about a month and a half. He called me to hang out and it was amazing. After that we would often go grab coffee together and hangout and I really enjoyed it. However, after winter break, we just stopped talking. I called him out last time, thinking maybe I should let him invite me next time, but he never did. A few months later, I unfollowed him and removed him from social media to try to get over him.
We didn’t talk at all for the rest of the school year, not even a ""hi"" in the halls. Last week, my friend, who knows him, asked what happened between me and him, and he said he was an asshole and he feels so bad about how things ended. He found out later that I had a crush on him and couldn’t believe it because his classmates would tease him, saying no one would. I remember that before we started hanging out together, someone said his girlfriend cheated on him with six guys, so he felt extremely insecure. Maybe he wasn’t even ready for something more than a friendship at the time which is understandable.
But the thing is, I still haven’t really gotten over him lol, and now I don’t know what to do. He doesn’t know I found this out. Should I just leave it alone or follow him again and ask him out? Any advice?

Every single time I wake up I stay up for over 24 hours.,"Just for some context, I am 17F, currently not in school or working, taking some time off, i don’t use any drugs and I don’t drink, period. I have a weird appetite, sometimes I only get hungry once a day, and if I try to eat more then that I physically can’t without feeling sick, other times it feels like my stomach is a bottomless pit, ngl.

So i’ve had sleeping problems for years. As I am writing this i have been awake for over 26 hours. Since I was 12 i’ve had struggles going to bed, as in not being able to sleep until 3-5 am, even on school nights. It stayed like that for a while, but here in the past two-ish months it’s gotten much worse. Every single time I wake up and start my day, I end up not going to bed until after the same time the next day, and then I sleep for a solid 12-16 hours. This is not normal and I can’t control it.

Here’s an example:

wake up at 7:00AM monday, go to sleep Tuesday 10AM, wake up at 12:00AM wednesday

When I do fall asleep, I either have a completely dreamless sleep, or I dream weird stuff all night long, often times when i dream i wake up 3-7 times a night.

Just for some questions I know will be asked, no nothing major in my life has happened that could cause stress or what not. No moving houses, or any of that stuff. Life is completely normal. If it’s any use to know, i’ve always been an extremely tired person, always having hardly any energy, to the point where i feel like im falling asleep walking from my room to the restroom. I’ve had blood work done and such, and it always comes back normal. I drink plenty of water and I do my best to avoid caffeine aside from morning coffee or occasionally a soda with a meal. Literally any insight would be much appreciated, i’m going insane with this sleep schedule and i’m starting college later this month so i’m not too fond of having a sleep schedule like this. Thanks in advance

1fxjido,https://www.reddit.com/r/PAstudent/comments/1fxjido/passed_the_pance/,Passed the PANCE!,"This has not been an easy road, I've failed and retaken many exams (esp. during didactic) and I never thought I'd get to this point. It is so surreal but I am super proud of myself! I've read a lot of these leading up to the PANCE and wanted to share my stats as well in case it helps someone else.

**PACKRAT 1** - 111 without studying

**PACKRAT 2** after clinicals - 131 without studying

**EORs** (in order, did not need to retake any of these thankfully)

* Surgery: 376
* Family Med: 376
* Internal Med: 383
* Psych: 414
* Peds: 385
* Women's Health: 410
* Emergency Med: 419

**EOC:** 1481. I know this is atypical for most, but I actually failed the EOC with this grade.

We had a week off before the EOC and I spent the week relaxing/recovering and then I studied some high-yield topics the 2-3 days before. The passing score determined by my program was 1484 and I was devastated that I was three points below. I was told that I had 100% chance of failing the PANCE exam by my program director, and that I was an extremely borderline student.

I had to wait 60 days before retaking the EOC and my program gave me a rigorous remediation assignment. Everyone was enjoying their last summer semester and I was in the library every day working hard to get this done. I still made time to spend with my friends, and I took a trip to Jamaica and another to Europe during this time, however I studied throughout the entire thing. I also walked at graduation but did not receive my certificate or letter of completion.

They identified my four weakest topics on the EOC: Cards, HEENT, Urology/Renal, and Neuro, and made me do two-week blocks for each section. They'd give me a Rosh practice exam on Monday to be completed by Sunday. Based on the questions I'd get incorrect, I'd have to make 15 note outlines for each topic throughout the week. This included definitions, etiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostics, differential diagnosis, medical tx, surgical tx, emergent tx, patient education, and cite my sources. I had to use up to date or access medicine as my only sources for this assignment. It took 10-15 hours each week and was extremely tedious.

I'll be honest, mindlessly reading articles and copying over what I found onto a table for my note was not helpful. I was not actively retaining or applying this information. It kept me in the study zone leading up to the PANCE and racked up about 110 CME credits but other than that, I feel that I didn't truly remediate the assignment.

**EOC #2:** 1489. Barely any difference, but I still passed! I got my program completion letter and my real certificate and was cleared to take the PANCE starting on September 27th.

**How I studied for the PANCE:** For 3-4 weeks before the exam, I did practice exams every other day and reviewed in between. I used Rosh, UWorld, and PPP. These practice exams would range from 180-300 questions (3-5 hours) to help build my stamina. I'd find a cubicle in the library and bring a white board and marker and ear plugs to simulate the actual exam.

**Rosh:** 66% correct with 30% complete

**UWorld:** 63% correct with 69% complete

On in-between days I'd treat myself by finding new coffee shops and getting a sweet treat and I'd go through all the questions, that I got both right and wrong. I'd read the explanations on Rosh/UWorld. If I wanted to know more I'd use PPP. I made hand-written flash cards with high-yield topics and would draw out charts the way I'd do on the actual exam (asthma and COPD charts, cervical cancer screening, mneumonics like CRASH and burn, JONES, FROM JANE, all the different antibiotic treatments, **the cranial nerves,** etc.) If there was a topic I wanted to know more about, I'd hand-write 4-5 lines in a notebook with high-yield information from PPP. This was super helpful so that I wouldn't rememdiate the question, but the entire topic.

**Wellness:** I also focused on going to the gym 2-3x/week in the mornings, getting 8+ hours of sleep at night, and eating enough during this time. I also have ADHD so I figured out my meds with my neurologist, got put on Concerta, and would only take it when I was taking practice exams to help me focus.

My biggest piece of advice going into the PANCE is being confident that you know the correct answers, even if it's just a gut feeling to put an answer down first - stick with it and don't change it. My test taking strategy is answer the questions I know and skip the ones I don't know. It gave me momentum to go through the exam at a good pace bc I'm not being slowed down by questions I'm unsure about. By the time I reach #60, I always had time to go back and reread the questions I struggled on. Every time I look at these again, it always triggers a new memory of something different I studied and can help me get to the answer in a different way. Often if I had a gut feeling but skipped it (bc I'd rather do that than change my answers), when I go back, I'd stick with my initial gut feeling. To be honest, of the 5 questions I looked up after the PANCE that I used this strategy with, I got them all correct.

**PANCE score**: 432!!! I took mine on Friday and found out 4 business days after on Thursday 9am. 

This has been an absolute rollercoaster and I'm still in shock but getting an email from my program director saying ""way to go!!! welcome to the profession"" was so sweet after he second guessed me every step of the way. It is possible to bounce back if you are confident in your own abilities and drown out the noise. If you read this far, thank you for the support! And I have my UWorld until November 22 lol so lmk <3",3,1728229658.0,PAstudent,0,1.0,False

1fxjhlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dr_KhushbooSoni/comments/1fxjhlw/is_whiteness_of_teeth_an_indicator_of_their_health/,Is Whiteness of Teeth an Indicator of Their Health? 🦷✨,"When it comes to dental aesthetics, many people equate bright, white teeth with good health. But is this assumption accurate? Let's explore the relationship between tooth whiteness and dental health, dispelling myths and highlighting the facts! 🌟💬

# 1. Understanding Tooth Color: What Affects It? 🌈

Tooth color varies from person to person and is influenced by several factors:

* **Genetics:** Just like skin and hair color, the natural color of your teeth is largely determined by your genetics. Some people naturally have whiter teeth, while others may have a more yellowish tint.
* **Enamel Thickness:** The outer layer of teeth, known as enamel, can be thin in some individuals, allowing the yellowish dentin (the layer beneath the enamel) to show through. Thicker enamel can make teeth appear whiter.
* **Age:** As we age, enamel wears down, and dentin becomes more visible, often leading to darker-looking teeth.
* **Diet:** Certain foods and beverages (like coffee, tea, and red wine) can stain teeth over time. Smoking and tobacco use are also major contributors to discoloration.

# 2. Health vs. Aesthetics: The Myth of White Teeth 🏥❌

**Whiteness Does Not Equal Health:**  
While bright white teeth may be aesthetically pleasing, they are not necessarily a sign of good dental health. Healthy teeth can be various shades of white, yellow, or even gray. Conversely, overly white teeth from excessive whitening treatments can indicate underlying issues, such as damage to the enamel.

# 3. Signs of Healthy Teeth 🌟✅

Healthy teeth exhibit certain characteristics beyond color, including:

* **Minimal Staining:** While some staining is natural, excessive or deep stains can indicate poor oral hygiene or dietary habits.
* **Strong Structure:** Healthy teeth should be strong and not overly sensitive. If you experience frequent sensitivity or pain, this could be a sign of underlying dental issues, regardless of the color of your teeth.
* **Gum Health:** Healthy teeth are accompanied by healthy gums, which should be pink and firm, without signs of swelling, bleeding, or recession.

# 4. The Role of Dental Care in Tooth Health 🦷🪥

**Regular Dental Visits:**  
The best way to ensure the health of your teeth is to maintain a good oral hygiene routine. Regular check-ups with your dentist can help catch any potential problems early, regardless of the color of your teeth.

**Good Oral Hygiene Practices:**  
Brushing twice a day, flossing daily, and using mouthwash can help maintain overall dental health and prevent staining. While whitening treatments can improve aesthetics, they should not replace regular dental care.

# 5. The Impact of Whitening Treatments 🌟💉

**Professional vs. At-Home Treatments:**  
If you're looking for a brighter smile, consider professional whitening treatments administered by a dentist. They are safer and more effective than over-the-counter products, which can sometimes cause damage to your enamel if misused.

**Limitations and Risks:**  
Overuse of whitening products can lead to tooth sensitivity and enamel erosion. Always consult with your dentist before starting any whitening regimen to ensure it’s appropriate for your dental health.

# Final Thoughts 💭✨

While whiteness may contribute to the aesthetics of your smile, it is not a definitive indicator of dental health. Healthy teeth can be of various shades, and maintaining proper dental hygiene is far more important than striving for a specific color. Focus on regular dental check-ups, good oral hygiene practices, and a balanced diet for optimal dental health. Remember, a healthy smile is what truly matters! 🦷💖

Long story short, I got my start in roleplaying back during the golden age of AOL and Yahoo (anyone else remember the Red Dragon Inn back in the late 90s and early 2000s?). Ah, those were the days, right? When the biggest worry was your dial-up connection, haha.

As I'm sure you'd all agree—finding long-term, advanced/literate writers is much more challenging these days. I have fond memories of when the process of coming up with a plot was an organic process; where you'd genuinely take the time to get to know the other person, build rapport, and allow a plot to form naturally.

That's what I'm hoping to find. With that said, I put a lot of effort into this post, so hopefully there's someone else out there who values the same things in a writing partner!

**First of all, here's a bit about me as a person:**

* I'm 30+, male, and I've written several novels and a bunch of articles, mostly in historical fiction and contemporary stories. Writing isn't just my job; it's pretty much a part of who I am.
* I'm always trying to learn something new, whether it's from books, documentaries, or just good old chatting. History and cultures fascinate me the most.
* When I'm not buried in books or work, I love to hike and take photos. There’s something about being out in nature that just clears my head.
* I love to read (especially non-fiction and historical fiction). I'm always down for swapping book recommendations, if you're also a reader!
* I love peanut butter (crunchy over smooth any day – fight me).
* On that note, if I'm being honest, coffee isn't just a drink for me; it's a ritual!
* I'm a big fan of the simple things in life. Give me a sunset, a good laugh, or a perfect slice of pizza, and I’m set.
* I love diving into those deep, meandering conversations that start with ""what if"" and end somewhere between ""the meaning of life"" and ""why can’t we tickle ourselves?""
* Fun fact: I used to be able to recite all 50 states in alphabetical order — a party trick born out of a grade school challenge, haha.

**Here's what I'm looking for in a writer:**

* ***Writing Style -*** I'm looking for a partner who has a strong command of the English language. I'm talking about descriptive passages that paint clear pictures, dialogue that is crisp, concise, and not overly flowery. I prefer to write in the 3rd person, past tense. I prefer modern fiction and historical fiction stories.
* ***Communication -***  Life's unpredictable! What’s important is keeping each other in the loop about our schedules and any changes in the story or our approach. A quick heads-up can make a huge difference. It's all about being honest and direct with our feedback and thoughts.
* ***Long-Term Plots -*** I'm really looking for a writing partner who's in it for the long haul and is passionate about crafting intricate, plot-driven stories. For me, the joy of roleplaying lies in developing a story that evolves over time, with twists and turns that keep us both engaged and inspired.
* ***Sense of Humor -*** Writing together should be fun and relaxed, not just a serious crafting of narratives. It’s important to me that we can both throw in a bit of humor now and then, not only in our stories but in our interactions too.

And there you have it! If you're a detail-oriented, communicative, mature, and long-term story lover, you might just be the writing partner I'm looking for.

We should totally write such a good story that our keyboards will need a vacation after we're done, haha. I hope to hear from you!",2,1728229392.0,Roleplay,0,1.0,False

I don't remember where I saw it, maybe Nespresso's website or an email, but it indicated it would take 30 days to process the refund. Which was already ridiculous to begin with.

A month and a half later, in mid-August, I checked my statements and confirmed I hadn't received a refund. I contacted them via the chat on their website, and only then did they ""process"" the refund. It seemed like they wouldn't have done so if I hadn't reached out. I received an email stating ""This message is to inform you that we have received your return and a refund has been processed to your credit card. Please allow 3-5 business days for this credit to be reflected on your account.""

Fast forward to today, October 6th, and I discovered a $175 credit in my Nespresso account. I started another chat with them, and they said they couldn't refund me because I used Google Pay and they didn't have my credit card information on file?? No one ever contacted me about this. They wanted to offer me $20 more in credit for my ""inconvenience"" - but at this point that is really unacceptable, I wonder how many people never get their money back because they didn't bother to check?

So far my first run tests have been full power to first crack, then 25% for 1-2 minutes to develop before hitting the cooling cycle and opening the door. All of the beans pop at the same time, which was shocking but demonstrates how evenly the machine heats. 

Happy to hear any advice or recommendations regarding this machine. I make my coffee for espresso and tend to prefer City+ to FC, or medium-light.

1fxj728,https://www.reddit.com/r/Broadway/comments/1fxj728/sunset_boulevard_mixedbag_review/,Sunset Boulevard mixed-bag review,"I saw Sunset Boulevard last night. It was...an interesting experience! I mostly liked it but I have mixed thoughts.

Pros: Nicole Scherzinger eats and leaves no crumbs. She is a beautiful singer. Her comedic timing is great. She is a star. She should have been in the show more. I mostly liked the guy who played Joe, but he has kind of a flat affect that I'm sure is intentional for the show but I'm not sure always worked. Does he ever smile? No. In a show with so many funny moments, I found that to be a little bit jarring I think? That said, there are a lot of funny moments and comedy here. The guy who played Max was a scene stealer and the best part besides Nicole. His voice is amazing. The minimalist set is fine. The black and white color scheme was cool, especially when it was punctuated by red in a few scenes. I enjoyed the steady-cam streaming and thought that it worked. Being able to see the actors' faces close up during certain scenes was cool and more impactful. The visuals were memorable. I liked the first number at the top of Act II (minimal spoilers--they film inside the theater for a bit and this was really fun) but also I thought the street-filmed stuff everyone has seen on TikTok came off as a liiiiiitle gimmicky. Like, Joe is just singing. Can't he just sing on stage? Why do I need to see these randos on the street filming him on their iphones while he's singing? That said, the final scene and the end was cool and creepy and effective.

Cons: I had no idea who Jamie Lloyd was before this production, but the dude is an egomaniac and not in a cute way. He splashes his name across the screen more than once, including in a few more subdued ways (it's stamped on coffee mugs we see in one scene). It was eye-roll inducing to me. I mostly liked how the production was put on but the show itself just doesn't have a lot of good musical numbers. I don't have any interest in listening to the score again, which is somewhat rare for a musical for me. The tone shifts were jarring and odd at times (is this a comedy or a deadly serious and dreary drama about murder?) The story was also sort of muddled--there were some moments I was confused about what was actually going on. Something to keep in mind if you aren't familiar with the show already.

Also, this may be controversial but because every character in the show is just a sh\*tty bad person (especially the ""heroine"" Norma) it makes things a little harder to enjoy. Like, Norma, why can't you just get your sh\*t together girl??? Go to therapy, Norma! Who am I supposed to root for here??

I think my main frustration is that the original show is just fine and nothing special (music is meh) and it is also very old-timey and FEELS very old timey. Like, I get the sentiment about older women being shunned out of Hollywood once they reach a certain age but things are just not as extreme as they once were. The themes of the show feel superficial and simplistic. I think Norma could be a much more complex character for modern audiences, rather than just a silly old Hollywood caricature. Why did so much effort go into putting such a (visually) modern twist on this old timey sorta-forgotten-about ALW musical when we could have had an original & NEW story that dabbled in similar themes?? I thought the show overall was pretty good but I am genuinely surprised at the INSANE hype. My prediction is that critics are going to be mixed on this one.

Made coffee with pressurised baskets for too long and decided to finally get a bottomless portafilter from Aliexpress. 

Quickly found out I cant grind well enough to use the bottomless and forced to return back to pressurised. 

Last month I finally decided to get a proper grinder and shopped around for a 2nd hand Sette 270.

Picked one up for a nice price, excited to finally get grinding fine enough, only to find out it doesnt go very fine at all. 

Google my issue and realise I am missing shims. 

No one in my country sells these shims and Baratza won't ship them to me either. 

Finally get my shims from Sweden.

I also decide to pick up a bunch of quality specialty beans of all kinds. 

First grind looks good, I pop the portafilter in, turn the water on and for some reason, the water goes around the portafilter. 

I realise the portafilter is broken and need to wait a month for a new one to arrive.

For grinder, looking at DF54. But, machine? I could save and get Bambino. (Bambino+ doesn't add much.) or the Brev that is like ours but lacks grinder (forget name). But I would love to step up to something with a larger portafilter and generally better, if I can do so <$600. I had been looking at MiiCoffee Apex/Turin Legato. 

But I had asked on here about the worrisome no-name machines on amazon (you can get a dual broiler for well less than $600). I noted that these cheap nonnames always have very few reviews. It looks like the sellers list them until the reviews go bad, and then relist them. 

Ok, but what is confusing me is that this looks to be the same story with the MiiCoffee Apex: very few reviews, and actually already very bad review score. 

Do people on here take the Apex/Legato more seriously than that? Should I infer that it might be worth buying something cheap from Amazon (including others? just this one?). I'm confused. 

If the answer is to stay away from all of these machines, then what is the step up from the Bambino. Re: Gaggia, no, I'm not particularly interested in modding it, so I think that is a no for me. Lelit Anna is a bit more expensive.

**Gender: Male**

**Personality: He is violent, rude, stupid, but can rather be silly at times.**

**Lore:**

His parents left him at the age of 12, so he had to teach himself from that point on, and eventually grew up to be a self-careless human who had horrible social skills and doesn't know how to connect with people, does things that could get him killed, but somehow survives, and doesn't really pay attention to anything. He mostly stays away from people, because as I mentioned, his social skills are horrible. Another reason why he stays away from people is because he is a violent and mentally unstable criminal, as he commits horrible felonies ( robberies, murders, etc. ). One of his biggest felonies was when he blew a nuclear power plant, the reason why is because since he is stupid, he eats uranium as a snack, but the staff kicked him out and threatened him that if he came in again, they would shoot him, so he blew the power plant up. Somehow he is able to control time and space, as he is able to teleport to other places, stop time , go back in time, but he rarely skips time. He also creates very dangerous weapons, such as powerful bombs, guns that I can't really explain because they're kind of complicated, and many other things. He is currently being hunted down by the government, the military, the police, and many other people. He has not yet been found, and is still doing horrible things. He is unstoppable at this point.

**Interests**

**Shooting**: He enjoys shooting just as a hobby because it's fun.

**Gaming**: He likes it just because (It's fun)

**Food**: He loves food, just like a normal person, but his diet is not normal. He eats uranium as a snack, but somehow the radiation doesn't affect him.

**Parkour**: He likes it because it's his favorite activity to do, and can also calm him down. Also something he can do in combat.

**Coffee**: He has a caffeine addiction, and cannot resist coffee if he spots it. It calms him down whenever he is stressed, and is just something he likes to drink, as its his favorite drink.

**Blowing things up**: I don't know why, he just likes blowing things up.",1,1728228102.0,u_Noob_not_here,0,1.0,False

The first meet up was a spontaneous one because it was a layover for him in my city as he was going to another island and stay for a week. We had coffee and talked for a bit and had a gym session. After that, we had a short dinner as he was going to catch his ferry that night. Everything went well, vibes were really good, we both had a good time. At first, I was really chill and kind of nonchalant about it, and I had no expectations for it as he was traveling, and it was interesting to meet a person from another country. 

Then the second time we met was when he came back to my city. We went out late at night to a hilltop view had some food and drinks. Everything in that moment was nice and slow and yet time was fast. It was quite cold on the top of the hill, so he was hugging me tightly by his side as we were walking around. Conversations were super interesting, and I think I was also quite funny that time. He also shared stories of his adventures, and I did as well. It was almost like the kind of date where you're starting to get to know that person more. So, after the nice overlooking view of the city, the food, and drinks, I drove us back to his hotel and spent time there. *\*Wink wink\**. After doing the deed, he told me not to leave yet and just come sleep with him for a bit, so I did. Though I eventually had to go home and pick my stupid brother up. So, before I left, we had one last bit to end the perfect night. The morning after, he left for his flight and texted each other that we had a good time and all that.

Now, I just can't seem to shake it off. I realized what I had wanted in a man was right with him and for some reason I felt that he was out of my league. I know in my head that this was all just for 'fun' right? But the heart is going against my brain, and I am acknowledging my feelings by writing down this post.   
  
How do I get over this? I need a reality check for real. 

TLDR; I met a guy who was traveling to my country for a bit, we both had a really good time when we met up twice. I did not expect to like him that much by the end of it all and that this man has set the bar high! ",1,1728227979.0,dating,2,1.0,False

I wake up everyday at 5am, I have a breakfast that is healthy and energizing within 30 minutes of waking up, followed by a coffee. I am on the road by 6am, and I open the daycare and work until about 3pm. By the time I get home I am exhausted. I am tapped out by like 8pm, but I usually stay up until 10-10:30pm, as I have a daughter at home and pets so I’m quite busy. My daughter is tough to put to bed, usually asleep by 9:30, closer to 10pm. Anyways, by the time she’s asleep I’m want some quality time for me/husband. So sometimes we push bedtime to 10:30pm so that we could have some time together. Then I’m back at it for 5am. 

I work with toddlers, with one program assistant, just for reference. I have been sneaking in a 30 minute nap around 4pm, after I’ve picked up my daughter from school. 

All to say, I’m pooched. Even on the weekends, with sleeping in until 7:30-8am, I’m still tired during the day. Is this typical for other ECE’s in the field to be so tired? I’d love perspective, advice here please. ",6,1728227908.0,ECEProfessionals,8,1.0,False

1fxiomk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fxiomk/twisted_dreams/,Twisted Dreams,"When you’re a kid living in a small town most of the time you are looking to plan your escape. This might not be the case in some small towns that are located stone’s throw away from a bigger city but for me that was never the case. I was born in a small town in the Midwest and while a lot of people had creature comforts like Wal-Mart or even a Starbucks on every corner, we barely had any of that. The nearest big chain store was around thirty miles from our front door which meant planning our trips to supplement what we grew on our farm.

For some farm life isn’t grand but I didn’t mind it as much as I got up early, did my chores, went to school and came home just to do it all over again. Now don’t get me wrong as my childhood was not horrible as I didn’t have ogres for parents and lived in a shoe box. I lived on a moderately successful farm, had loving parents and even made friends in school and around town. There were some parts of my childhood I can remember as clear as day such as going on long summer bike rides with my friends to the pond or spending nights outside looking up at the stars.

Those memories are like the places as they are gone as the farm was sold off to give our family a better life and friends moved out of that small town to pursue fortune and fame. Eventually I struck out on my own leaving my parents behind and finding out through a call from the local sheriff that they had both passed. Thoughts of not returning home for the funeral did cross my mind however, I was an only child and there were affairs that needed to be put right. Once all of that was done part of me could not leave that town fast enough as I wanted to flee back to my home in upstate New York. Why?

Tornados.

Twisters, tempests, hurricanes whatever you want to call these natural disasters were the bane of my existence when I was younger. Part of me wondered anytime the siren rolled across the plains if it would be my last night on this earth. Hell, there were times all I could think about were my parents dying horribly and leaving me an orphan. Anytime a tornado hit near our area we would hunker down in our storm shelter until we had gotten all clear. Fortunately, the twisters never even came close to our town as they seemed to strike cities and towns all around our state.

Recently I could not get a good night’s sleep and at first, I chalked it up to just nerves as there were a lot of projects with tight deadlines going on at work. However, once my workload decreased variations of the same nightmare plagued me night after night. I could be an adult, child or anywhere in between either with my parents, strangers or even by myself in a home that was both alien and familiar to me. Without warning that dreaded sound would fill my ears until it threatened to split my skull wide open.

The mournful wail of a tornado siren.

I tried to counteract the lack of sleep with sugar, caffeine, or a combination of the two however, it was to no avail. During moments of downtime, I could feel my eyelids draw heavy and was even starting to nod off in meetings. It did not take long for my boss to notice, and he pulled me in for a private meeting asking me what was going on as he seemed genuinely concerned. At first, I was ashamed to admit it as he asked if it was a problem with drugs or alcohol.

“Nothing like that sir, just been having trouble sleeping. Always seem to have a similar dream night after night.”

He nodded, typing away at the computer as he smiled at me. “You have been an amazing asset to this company for years. You are always on time, you put in long hours to get projects accomplished and have accrued a bit of sick and personal time. I want to send you to a psychiatrist that I have used from time to time, and the company will gladly pick up the bill.”

How could I say no?

He made the arrangements and told me that my first session would start tomorrow and sent me home after our meeting. After another night of fitful sleep and a stiff cup of morning coffee I made my way to their office. They were in a lavish business park that was home to a few medium sized companies and a non-descript office with just the number on the door. Making my way inside I was nervous as the receptionist asked for my name and then instructed me to have a seat. This brought up memories of having to sit in the principal’s office when I was a child. Eventually, an older woman dressed in a conservative suit opened the door, greeted me, and asked me into her office.

“Now I want to make one thing perfectly clear” she said in a tone that reminded me of my late grandmother which was cool and soothing. “This is a safe space. Anything that you say here will not be repeated as it will stay within the confines of these walls.”

The first three sessions were spent exploring my past along with my childhood as the standard questions were asked. Did you have a happy childhood? Were you well liked in school? What did your parents think of you? These sessions seemed to go nowhere as the nightmares were getting progressively worse and the quality of sleep seemed to be degrading.

“I want to try something in this session if you are up for it. Have you heard of hypnotherapy?”

She explained the process as she would be able to put me into a hypnotic state to probe deeper into what was troubling me. What did I have to lose other than more sleep. I told her that I would be willing to do this and the rest of this is an audio transcription of what happened.

Therapist: “You are now in a relaxed state can you hear me?”

Patient: “Yes, I can hear you.”

T: “OK, I want you to think back to you were around twelve years old. Think back to that time in your life. Where are you now?”

P: “I.. I am in my room. Wow the PlayStation 2 is amazing and GTA 3 is an awesome game! Better than that dumb ‘ol X-Box that Nathan has and who cares about Halo?”

T: “Very good and this is in your hometown of \[REDACTED\]”

P: “Yeah in fact I am lookin’ out of my window and seeing the fields of corn we’ve planted. Seems like we’re gonna have to harvest that soon.”

T: “As you look outside you noticed that the skies are darkening and without warning you hear the wail of a tornado siren.”

P: \*panicked breathing\* “M-mom? Dad? We need to get down to the storm shelter!”

T: “You make your way down into the basement and then into the sub-basement into a smaller room that’s stocked with provisions, blankets and a crank radio. You and your family are safe.”

P: \*breathing slows down\* “Phew! That was a close call is everyone OK?”

T: “The radio blares to life as the announcer comes back with warnings for various counties. You notice that your county isn’t listed, and the only mention is a county with a town that’s at least 100 miles from yours.”

P: “That’s really good news isn’t it dad?”

T: “It sure is son. An hour passes until you get an all clear from the radio. You make your way outside and see that there wasn’t even any damage to the house, livestock or crops.”

P: “Awesome! Do I have enough time to play some video games before dinner mom?”

T: “Have you forgotten? It’s summer vacation you can do whatever you want.”

P: “Oh that’s right! Tomorrow I am going to ride my bike around the neighborhood and go fishing!”

T: “After a night of playing video games you get up nice and early and head out on your bike. What do you see?”

P: “I am pedaling down the drive of my house and there’s something at the end of the drive. It’s.. it’s a dog.”

T: “A dog?”

P: “Y-Yeah this white mutt of a dog that belongs to Mr. Campbell a mean ol’ man that lives two farms over. He would let out his dog every day and it would terrorize the kids that lived around here. I can hear him growling.”

T: “The dog doesn’t notice you in fact it spots something in the tall grass and chases after it leaving you alone with nothing else around you.”

P: “I spent most of the morning and into the early afternoon visiting with friends, hanging out at the local diner and just taking in being on summer vacation. Eventually, I make my way out of town to my favorite fishin’ hole as I get off my bike and set up my pole.”

T: “The summer heat isn’t unbearable as you settle in as you cast your pole into the water. You spend hours as you relax and let your mind drift away. The sounds of the local wildlife a nice background track for this perfect day.”

P: “This is so relaxing.. I feel.. like.. oh.. no.”

T: “What happened?”

P: “I.. I slept! The sun is starting to dip low behind the trees! Mom and dad are gonna be cross with me if I don’t get home before dark! Wait.. there’s a shortcut that my friend Dave told me about. It’ll get me home quicker!”

T: “So you’re on the shortcut tell us about it.”

P: “Damn you, Dave! It was only good for around 3 miles and it dead ends at a cornfield. Crap! I need to get home!”

T: “Is there a path between the rows?”

P: “Yeah! I can just walk my bike through the corn. Whose farm is this? There’s not supposed to be a farm out this way I thought?”

T: “OK so you’re walking your bike along do you see or hear anything?”

P: “… yeah. Something weird. I have no idea what that is I make my way over towards the sounds. It sounds like… people talking?”

T: “Can you see anything out of the ordinary?”

P: “I see smoke wafting from a top of the corn stalks? And voices.. but.. they’re not panicked and there’s some type of rhythm to it? What in the heck is going on? I need to get home so onward I go.”

T: “So you’re following the path?”

P: “W.. what is this? I see a clearing there is a fire burning an.. oh god.. there’s an altar of stone in the middle of a circular part of this field. The dog .. Mr. Campbell’s dog is strapped to it and all cut open.. oh my god I am gonna be sick. There’s so much blood!”

T: “Calm down. What else do you see?”

My therapist explained to me that it was some sort of repressed memory and while I tried to comprehend why I could not remember he cited it could be related to trauma. When I asked him about the incident in the corn field he shrugged and rattled off a few explanations such as a fever dream or some sort of imaginary event that I remembered instead.

I knew that wasn’t true.

After that last session I started to sleep more soundly as the nightmares seemed to vanish overnight. The next morning, I awoke refreshed and with a newfound energy and it showed in my performance at work. Deadlines were met, productivity increased, and it showed in my performance and attitude at work and my boss was impressed by how quickly I turned things around.

But that’s not the reason why I am so scared.

The thing that scares me right now is that I live in upstate New York, and it is dusk now and there’s not even a cloud in the sky. And the sound that I hear in the distance sends a cold shiver down my spine.

Because it is the mournful wail of a tornado siren.

She is completely immobile. Her husband has been paying out of pocket for 6 hours per day to a neighbor who bathes her, feeds her(whatever is available), transfers her to the commode, drives her to appointments, takes her to the store when my friend wants to go, makes her bed, and does very minimal light housekeeping like the dishes. He hired a professional from an agency and last week was the 2nd week that an HHA has been there. The neighbor is still working there and bathing her, feeding her, etc. The only thing the aide has done is transfer my friend to the toilet, help her with her cough assist twice during each shift and make her a cup of coffee from her Keurig. Other than that she sits in a chair all day on her phone and watching TV. Her husband has been paying out of pocket for this. Now that insurance has approved 16 hours per day, 7 days a week, I’m wondering what he can actually ask to be in the contract? Can the aides be asked to do the clients laundry? Make her bed? Go to the store for her? For those of you who have Home health aide’s, what does your aide do for you or your loved one with ALS? Is this something you put in a contract before hiring the agency? One day, the aide failed to show up and didn’t call. How does your agency deal with those situations. My girlfriend feels awkward asking a stranger to make her bed and do her laundry. This is why her husband is still paying her neighbor/friend $750 weekly for 30 hours of her time. I’m trying to help them figure out the things they are allowed to ask for in the care contract and what they can’t. Whichever aide gets my friend as a client will be so very lucky because she’s truly a joy and very kind and generous. I’m interested in other’s experiences. Thank you in advance.

I was pretty excited for the opportunity, especially because it was in a known Manhattan club. 

First of all, the promoter as well as the event organizer texted all the DJs how the only type of music should be played should be “Afro house, melodic house, and house” and used Camelphat, Artbat, black coffee, Rufus, lane 8 and Solomun as examples. And stated how absolutely no edm or tech house should be played. So I curated a list of songs that fit this vibe

I got to the club at 12 to watch the headliner going before me, and all he was playing was sweet 16 music. Like 4 minutes to save the world by Justin Timberlake with a corny tech house beat under it.  And songs exactly like that on repeat. I was like this is going to be a big switch for the people enjoying this because my set was going to be extremely different. 

Now 1:55 rolls around and I make my way towards the stage..

I’m standing on the packed stage letting this DJ do his thing, didn’t want to kill his vibe, but it’s now 1:59 and I pull up and show him my usb and he looks away and continues dancing. 

I tap him - ignored 

I tap him again and throw my usb into the open CDJ and he looks pissed (it’s 2 am now) 

I let his last song rock, and I’m like yo I gotta plug my headphones in. He doesn’t understand that he needs to unplug his. So I tell him and this must’ve set him off. 

He unplugs his headphones, lets me plug mine in, as I’m mixing my song in he presses the cue button on the mixer i can’t hear the song and I’m like wtf?

Then I turn the button back on and he rips my headphones out 

I plug it right back and now I’m like WTF?

I guess I didn’t notice he did this, but he turned the headphones volume all the way up on the mixer, which actually cooked my ears. 

At this point I lower the volume as his song was nearing the end and just played my opening song. 

But is it normal to deal with people like this? I’ve never met him before and he has no idea who I am, but I was expecting a handshake, how you doing man nice to meet you, and a simple friendly transition. 

Did I get my hopes up?

It's been a long journey so far but after firing our first contractor things are finally moving in the right direction!

Unfortunately first contractor didn't send us any of the design files he was working off so we ended up spending this entire weekend learning how to use Chief Architect.  *We still suck*, but hopefully good enough to get the point across.

Now we need some help figuring out how to lay out our dream kitchen!

**Kitchen Concept:** The kitchen is U shaped with the fridge on the left due to two structural columns that will be hidden in the wall next to the fridge.  All designs shown have a square island to maximize the walkway on the sink wall but we did consider a couple of square islands as well.

The fun part... We are taking in a small portion of our garage to create a 4 x 7 walk-in pantry and want to disguise the kitchen pantry door as an oversized wall to wall cabinet.  We are also extending the cabinets on the other side of the garage door where the dining room will be to create a coffee / bar / buffet counter top with some open shelving.

**What we need help deciding:  How to make the pantry door look best and keep the kitchen balanced.**

Option 1: Pull the right cabinets 24"" out to create an appliance garage with counter top underneath it. Pantry door also comes out 24"" to be flush with this cabinet.  Standard 12"" cabinet on range counter.  Fridge side of kitchen has corner counter top. Window wall has no shelving.

Option 2: Pull the left and right cabinets 24"" out to create two appliance garages... this is the same thing as option 1 but we've added another appliance garage there to maybe make it more balanced.

Option 3: No appliance garages, use open shelving on window wall.  Pantry door would look like a pantry appliance panel but would be effectively flat against the wall.  We would add a dummy filler appliance panel on pantry wall next to pantry door.

Option 4: We're working on this now but this would be basically to scrap the garage pantry bump out entirely and just mover the fridge next to the stove and use the current fridge cabinet area as a pantry (can add these soon)

Would love your help figuring this out, please let me know if there's any other information I can provide!",1,1728226756.0,floorplan,0,1.0,False

The Great Debate!,"[https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mindmaze411/episodes/Moral-relativism-vs--moral-objectivism---Are-morals-subjective-or-objective-e2p94hk](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mindmaze411/episodes/Moral-relativism-vs--moral-objectivism---Are-morals-subjective-or-objective-e2p94hk)

Hey there, ethics enthusiasts and curious minds! Today, we're diving into a philosophical showdown that's been cooking for centuries: moral relativism vs. moral objectivism. Buckle up, because this isn't your average philosophy class snooze-fest – we're about to explore whether morals are more like pizza toppings (to each their own) or universal laws of the universe!

# The Relativist's Buffet of Morality

Imagine you're at a global potluck dinner. The moral relativists are the ones saying, ""Try everything! There's no one 'right' dish!"" They believe that morals are like cultural cuisines – what's considered ethical in one society might be taboo in another, and that's totally fine.

These folks argue that our moral compasses are shaped by our upbringing, culture, and personal experiences. To them, judging another culture's ethics is like criticizing someone for putting pineapple on pizza (controversial, I know, but hear me out).

The relativist motto might as well be: ""When in Rome, do as the Romans do... even if that means cheering for gladiator fights!""

# The Objectivist's Moral Periodic Table

On the other side of the philosophical cafeteria, we have the moral objectivists. These are the people who believe there's a universal set of ethical elements, like a moral periodic table that applies everywhere, from New York to New Guinea.

They'd argue that some things – like kindness, fairness, and not randomly punching strangers – are objectively good, regardless of what any particular culture thinks. It's like saying gravity exists whether you believe in it or not (sorry, flat-earthers!).

The objectivist battle cry: ""Some things are just wrong, even if everyone's doing it!""

# Real-World Food for Thought

Now, this isn't just some abstract debate for philosophy majors to argue about over coffee. This stuff has real-world implications:

1. **Healthcare Conundrums**: Should doctors always respect a patient's wishes, even if it goes against their medical advice? The relativist might say, ""It's their body, their choice,"" while the objectivist could argue, ""There's an objective best medical practice.""
2. **AI and Ethics**: As we teach robots to make decisions, do we program them with culturally specific ethics or try to instill universal values? It's like choosing between making an AI that's a moral chameleon or a rigid rule-follower.
3. **Global Diplomacy**: When nations with different values negotiate, do we seek common ground based on universal principles, or do we embrace a ""you do you"" approach to international relations?

# The Spicy Criticisms

Of course, both sides have their critics. Some say moral relativism is a slippery slope that could justify harmful practices under the guise of cultural respect. (""Sorry, we can't criticize that dictator – it's just their culture!"")

Meanwhile, objectivism gets flak for potentially imposing one culture's values on others. (Imagine if everyone in the world had to agree on the best pizza topping – chaos!)

# Finding the Secret Sauce

So, what's the answer? Are morals subjective or objective? Well, like many great philosophical debates, it's not a simple either/or.

Many modern thinkers are cooking up theories that blend elements of both. Maybe there are some basic, universal moral ingredients (like ""don't hurt others for fun""), but the specific recipe varies by culture.

It's like saying everyone needs food to survive, but how that food is prepared and enjoyed can differ wildly across the globe.

# Your Turn to Stir the Pot!

What do you think? Are morals as diverse as our taste in music, or is there a universal moral melody we're all trying to harmonize with?

Next time you're faced with an ethical dilemma, take a moment to consider: Are you basing your decision on your cultural ""menu,"" or are you tapping into something more universal?

Remember, questioning our moral assumptions isn't just mental gymnastics – it's how we grow as individuals and as a society. So keep asking questions, stay curious, and maybe think twice before judging someone's moral pizza toppings!

Now, if you'll excuse me, all this talk of pizza has made me hungry. Time to order a philosophically diverse range of toppings and ponder the nature of morality over a slice... or five!

Don't really have much else super exciting going on, I've spent the last several years just focusing on work. Most of my plane time has been spent writing and reading and processing the past year with all of its ups and downs. And most of my work is either done in the offices of our clients or in coffee shops. 

Been wanting to finish a tattoo sleeve that I have been putting off for a while but I have the inside of my forearm done and hopefully will finish my forearm by the end of the year.

Au-delà de son rôle de stimulant, il est un symbole de sociabilité et un moteur économique pour de nombreux pays. Voici un regard sur son évolution historique, son influence culturelle et son impact économique.

---

**1. Les Origines du Café : Une Découverte Fortuite en Éthiopie**

L’histoire du café commence en **Éthiopie**, vers le IXe siècle. Selon la légende, un berger nommé **Kaldi** aurait remarqué que ses chèvres devenaient particulièrement énergiques après avoir mangé les baies d’un certain arbuste. Intrigué, il décida de goûter lui-même les fruits et ressentit leur effet stimulant. Cette découverte fortuite est à l’origine de l’utilisation des baies de café en Afrique de l’Est, où elles étaient d'abord mâchées avant d’être transformées en boisson.

Les tribus éthiopiennes utilisaient ensuite le café de manière médicinale, écrasant les baies pour en faire des boules mélangées à de la graisse animale, consommées pour leur effet énergisant. Le **royaume d’Aksoum** est souvent considéré comme l'une des premières civilisations à avoir compris les bienfaits du café.

**1.1 La propagation du café dans le monde arabe**

Le café a rapidement traversé la mer Rouge pour atteindre la **péninsule arabique**, où il a pris racine au Yémen, autour du XVe siècle. Là, les grains étaient torréfiés et bouillis pour créer la boisson chaude que l’on connaît aujourd’hui. Le café a pris le nom de **qahwa**, qui signifie « ce qui empêche le sommeil » en arabe, un clin d’œil à ses effets stimulants.

Les **soufis**, moines mystiques de l’islam, utilisaient le café pour rester éveillés lors de leurs longues prières nocturnes. Cette pratique s’est répandue rapidement dans les villes saintes de **La Mecque** et **Médine**, faisant du café une boisson très prisée. À mesure que le commerce augmentait, la ville portuaire de **Moka**, au Yémen, est devenue un centre névralgique de la production de café, lui donnant le nom bien connu de « moka ».

**1.2 L’arrivée en Europe et la naissance des cafés publics**

Au XVIe siècle, les marchands vénitiens, fascinés par la boisson arabe, ont introduit le café en **Europe**. Cependant, il n’a pas été immédiatement accepté. Certaines figures religieuses voyaient en lui une boisson ""infidèle"", car elle venait du monde musulman. En 1600, le pape **Clément VIII**, après avoir goûté au café, l’aurait trouvé si délicieux qu’il décida de le baptiser, marquant ainsi son acceptation en Europe chrétienne.

Les premiers **cafés publics** d’Europe sont apparus à **Venise** au début du XVIIe siècle, suivis par d’autres villes comme **Paris** et **Londres**. Ces établissements, appelés **cafés** ou **maisons de café**, devinrent rapidement des centres de vie intellectuelle et sociale. En France, le **Café de Procope**, fondé à Paris en 1686, est célèbre pour avoir accueilli des philosophes des **Lumières**, comme Voltaire et Rousseau, qui venaient débattre autour d’une tasse de café.

---

**2. Le Café Comme Symbole Culturel : Un Élément de Sociabilité et de Diplomatie**

Au fil des siècles, le café a transcendé son rôle de simple boisson pour devenir un symbole culturel, social et politique. Il est non seulement une boisson stimulante, mais aussi un vecteur de rencontres et de débats.

**2.1 Les cafés et la révolution intellectuelle en Europe**

Au XVIIIe siècle, les **cafés** européens étaient des lieux de rassemblement pour les intellectuels, écrivains et politiciens. On y discutait de politique, de philosophie, et de littérature. Ces établissements ont joué un rôle crucial dans le développement des **révolutions** politiques et sociales, notamment la Révolution française. Des figures comme **Robespierre**, **Danton**, et d’autres révolutionnaires français fréquentaient les cafés pour échanger des idées et fomenter des plans pour un nouveau gouvernement.

En Angleterre, les cafés étaient appelés des **penny universities**, car pour un penny, on pouvait non seulement boire du café, mais aussi assister à des débats et discuter avec des penseurs et des scientifiques. Le **Lloyd’s Coffee House** à Londres, fondé en 1688, est d’ailleurs à l’origine de ce qui deviendra plus tard le **Lloyd’s of London**, une célèbre compagnie d'assurance.

**2.2 Le café dans la culture moderne**

Dans les sociétés modernes, le café est devenu un véritable symbole de **sociabilité**. Que ce soit à travers les **cafés littéraires** de l’Europe ou les **coffee shops** des grandes villes américaines, il incarne un lieu de rencontre où les idées circulent librement. Les chaînes internationales telles que **Starbucks** ont popularisé le café comme une boisson de tous les jours, accessible à tous, et ont joué un rôle dans la diffusion de la culture du café à travers le monde.

---

**3. Le Café Comme Produit Commercial et Économique : Un Marché Mondial de Plusieurs Milliards**

Le café est, après le pétrole, la **seconde marchandise la plus échangée au monde** en termes de valeur. Des millions de personnes dépendent de sa culture pour leur subsistance, et il joue un rôle central dans l’économie de nombreux pays.

**3.1 Les grandes régions productrices de café**

Aujourd’hui, plus de **25 millions de petits producteurs** cultivent du café, principalement dans des pays en développement. Les principales régions productrices sont situées entre le **Tropique du Cancer** et le **Tropique du Capricorne**, dans ce qu’on appelle la **ceinture du café**. Les plus grands producteurs de café au monde sont le **Brésil**, le **Vietnam**, la **Colombie**, et l’**Éthiopie**, chacun ayant développé ses propres variétés et méthodes de culture.

Le café est cultivé principalement selon deux variétés : **Arabica** et **Robusta**. L'**Arabica**, qui pousse dans les hautes altitudes, est plus prisé pour son goût doux et son acidité, tandis que le **Robusta**, plus résistant et riche en caféine, est souvent utilisé dans les mélanges ou pour l'espresso en raison de son amertume.

**3.2 Les enjeux économiques et environnementaux**

Le commerce mondial du café est un levier économique important, mais il est aussi source de **problèmes environnementaux** et sociaux. La pression pour produire en masse a conduit à des pratiques de déforestation dans certaines régions, menaçant la biodiversité. Par ailleurs, les petits producteurs souffrent souvent des fluctuations des prix sur les marchés internationaux, ce qui les rend économiquement vulnérables.

Le mouvement du **commerce équitable** s’est développé pour répondre à ces défis. Il vise à garantir des prix justes aux producteurs et à promouvoir des pratiques agricoles durables. Les labels comme **Fairtrade** assurent que les caféiculteurs bénéficient d’un revenu décent, tout en réduisant l’impact environnemental de la culture du café.

---

**4. L’Essor du Café Spécialité : Un Renouveau Culturel**

Depuis les années 2000, on assiste à une véritable révolution dans la manière de consommer le café, portée par l’essor des **cafés de spécialité**. Contrairement au café de masse, le café de spécialité se concentre sur la qualité des grains, leur origine et les méthodes d’extraction.

**4.1 L’art de la torréfaction et de la dégustation**

Le mouvement du café de spécialité met l’accent sur le **terroir** et les **méthodes de torréfaction**. Chaque tasse devient une expérience unique, où les consommateurs apprennent à distinguer les différentes saveurs en fonction des régions et des variétés de grains. Des cafés comme ceux d’**Éthiopie**, de la **Jamaïque** ou du **Costa Rica** sont particulièrement recherchés pour leurs profils gustatifs complexes.

Ce renouveau a aussi donné naissance à des **compétitions internationales**, comme les **World Barista Championships**, où des baristas du monde entier s’affrontent pour préparer les meilleurs espressos, cappuccinos et cafés filtre.

**4.2 Le café et les nouvelles technologies**

L'innovation technologique a également transformé l'industrie du café. Des machines à expresso sophistiquées aux méthodes manuelles comme la **chemex** ou l’**aeropress**, de nouvelles façons d'extraire le café sont apparues, mettant en avant la précision et la finesse des saveurs.

---

**Conclusion**

En conclusion, le café est bien plus qu’une simple boisson ; il est une **histoire vivante**, un **symbole culturel** et un **moteur économique**. Des hauts plateaux d’Éthiopie aux cafés animés de Paris, en passant par les plantations d’Amérique latine, il continue d’évoluer tout en restant un élément central de la vie sociale et économique à travers le monde. À chaque gorgée, le café raconte une histoire millénaire, faite de découvertes",1,1728225868.0,u_rch_mehdi,0,1.0,False

1fxi1xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1fxi1xb/my_unending_rosey_nightmare/,My Unending Rosey Nightmare,"Names altered for privacy. Trigger Warning.

This morning, I jolted awake from a nightmare. I'm typically a heavy sleeper and don't dream often, when I do, I typically am not able to recall my dreams. This one, I typically don't recall after rejoining the overworld. But this morning is different. This morning, I recall. I recall having this nightmare often. These nightmares started when I got away from Rosey. It’s as if my dream world and reality swapped places. The once peaceful refuge of sleep has become my Rosey nightmare.

In the years leading up to my escape, Rosey used to have a boundary she wouldn't cross with my sleep. It was my refuge. My place to go when I could no longer bare the relentless accusations and berating. Where I'd no longer have to fear getting hit, stabbed, or kicked. One of my few escapes that didn't include running and trying to get past Rosey barricading my escape. The escape I needn't fear of being chased after. Over the last year or so that changed. She started waking me from my sleep. Shed shove, elbow, hit, and even kick to wake me up. Sometimes it was because she randomly made food in the wee hours of the night and wanted to share, towards the end it was more often to accuse and berate me. Sleep, once my haven, become my hell.

In my nightmare, I'm on an Island. The journey to escape involves navigating through two islands. The first is a chaotic, dimly lit indoor space, resembling a cluttered thrift store with narrow, debris-filled pathways. There is only one escape route, a path I’ve run countless times. Yet, each time feels like the first for Rosey as she chases me. A discrete, dark hole in the ground off to the side of the path leads to the second island.

The second island is rugged wilderness with steep, jagged coniferous mountain terrain and large trees I'm able to hide behind. I start off at the center with my escape route leading to a small fishing boat on the shore. It's the only boat around. Once I've made it to this island my escape is more likely as I make my way down to the boat, hassle with it as quicky as I can to get it started, and riding off into the night as the island fades into the distance under the moonlight.

Getting away however, isn't easy. I'm a 5'8"" 230lb man and she's slender 5'4"" 120lb woman with an inhuman ferocity. I'm disabled with bilateral sciatica. My legs can't move fast enough. I'm only able to run faster than her in short bursts. To get away I have to wait until she's distracted; but she's vigilant. She anticipates my attempt to escape. I'm lucky if I get more than a 30 second lead. She can run faster than me for longer than me. The best escapes are when I have enough of a lead to make a sudden turn out of sight, find a decent hiding place, wait for her to pass and then give up finding me, or when she has an ailment that inhibits her keeping up with me.

I'm a big guy, why not fight? Can't do that, not an option. I don't fight unless I fear death is imminent. Men aren't allowed to fight women, and death being imminent is hardly excused. If I was to fight, I'd be up against a behemoth packaged in a 5'4"" 120lb body with insane strength and tenacity. She once threw a heavy wooden coffee table at me from across the room and hit me at chest height. When she was arrested a couple years ago it took everything 5-6 burly policemen had to get her into the police car despite her being handcuffed behind the back. One would think it was crackhead strength, although the only substance she'd use was concentrate THC.

Last night was one of those nights I couldn't make it away from Rosey. I'd found a hiding spot under furniture. At first she passed me by, then circled back when she realized I had disappeared. I thought, ""Yes! she's given up"" as she walked away. But I couldn’t just get up and run. I had to be sure she was really gone, far enough away that she wouldn’t see me when I emerged. The only way to be sure was to wait.

But last night, she wasn't gone. She came back and found me. I didn't want to look at her and confirm my fear, but I could feel her presence, her heavy gaze as she walked by. She had found me. Escape was impossible now; she knew I was trying to get away and wouldn’t let herself be distracted.

Yet, I did get away. For the first time, I escaped Rosey by waking up. For the first time, I can recall this recurring nightmare after waking. Sleep is no longer my refuge. But now, I wake up in the security of my family home, surrounded by the support of my siblings. I’m safe, at least until I sleep again tonight.",1,1728225827.0,domesticviolence,0,1.0,False

Got to Ushuaia about 7pm and did that until close at 11pm. Music was great until the last hour… not sure who was on, but it was very poppy and cheesy. Low energy too.

We got into Hi as it opened. What an incredible club. The music in the bathroom area was fantastic right from the off. Just good old fashioned house, absolutely perfect. Great crowd, the usual posers, but enough proper clubbers in there that we felt in good company. We had one of the SIM card pills each and they were absolutely superb. The high lasted all night.

Some of our group left at 2/3am as they’d been partying for a few days, but my girlfriend and I eventually went into the red club room (passed on Black Coffee as it’s a bit chill for us). Damian Lazarus was… out of this friggin world. Probably one of the best clubbing experience I’ve had in my life. The music was just otherworldly, and when the GoGo dancers started doing there thing, everything just fused… the music, the lighting, the crowd, the whole atmosphere, and we were feeling transcendent. We’ve been here for 4 days and it felt like the Ibiza experience that we’ve always heard about.

I’ve read this subreddit a lot in the run up to this holiday, and it’s a lot of negative. Prices, crowds. I agree. €100 is insane, and the dance areas are shoulder to shoulder sometimes. But we always found an area in every club that was less crowded once we started looking around. We ended up right in front at Damian Lazarus, and there was a surprising amount of space.

So during the summer I had a lot of health problems and due to that, I had to go to gynecologist a lot. My regular doctor was on vacation, so I happen to book an appointment to this new doctor. He had great reviews. I had to visit him 3 times in this month. He is around my age (around 30) and extremely good looking. We had friendly chats during visit (I was never alone with him, his assistant was always there) but nothing special. Last time I visited him like 2 weeks ago, and on tuesday, he asked to follow me on insta.
Since I have a little crush on him granted the following and also asked to follow him (he has like 1500 followers and follows 500 for context). Then later that day I posted a story  which he instantly liked. 
I am flattered considering how good looking he is, but also feeling uncomfortable. He knows I am single and I actively see new people (during the questions he had to ask whether I have partner or not to make sure I get the right treatment) and that I might move to a new country soon.

I would go grab a coffee with him, since I Don't think he will be my ""regular doctor"" considering that his charm makes me feel awkward. However, kind of worried that he might follow ""other patients"" too and it is just a kink or something.

So, do you think he finds me attractive or just friendly? During my last visit I happen to mention him that I might be not moving, and he did ask if it is because of a new guy or something.",0,1728225596.0,dating_advice,9,0.33,False

I've been here about 3 weeks now and have settled in a bit, but socially I'm really feeling the fallout of being lonely in a new place lately. Being aware of my own mental health I know I need to get out, be uncomfortable and make things happen in order to stave off depression or those general negative feelings and thoughts.

My interests are really diverse. I enjoy gaming, museums, sports, comedy shows, random events and am not really picky about trying new things. I'm pretty extroverted and have a huge sense of humor. 

People at my work all seem to say the same things and it has to do with bars. I enjoy a couple drinks at a bar from time to time but that's not my main dig at all. But these people all have families, a network of friends and most have roots here. I'm a single dude with a cat so the relatability to give good advice hasn't really been there at all.

Being pretty extroverted and generally a curious person has already led me to some parks, a museum, outdoor market and a couple random events around town that were a bit underwhelming. I might go walk around Nuke-Con today in CB, we'll see. I saw there's a rock and mineral thing going on also.

There's been a couple hilarious interactions from my experiences so far. I decided to sit down and eat some lunch and people watch and a lady asked me if the coffee here was good. She was super pretty and I was like ""I wish I knew but I haven't tried it, you should though and come back and let me know."" She giggled and said ""does that line work on most women"" to which I replied ""I guess we're gonna find out right now."" Well, she said ""cute"" and walked away. A few mins later I saw her standing on the sidewalk with what appeared to be her husband and he had a stroller in front of him. They walked by and the dude mean mugged me the whole time. I just smiled like a thief honestly. Was a funny reminder how random people can be.

Another time I was watching some football at a restaurant/bar type place eating some wings and a couple guys next to me were talking about a specific game that recently happened and how they totally disagreed with a certain controversial play. We were at the bar and I said ""yea it's funny when refs make the game about them instead of the actual rules, I thought it was a touchdown also"" and one of them looked at me and said ""yea buddy we know what a touchdown is"" as his friend looked at me as if I had jizz on my face then both turned their back to me. I just laughed to myself and went on about my food. So weird. But it takes a lot to get under my skin, upset me or discourage me. Hey, I tried. Whatever!

I've been told ""everyone is online now-days, get Bumble/Hinge/FB dating"" and.. well, blah. Feels superficial judging people on a few prompts and pictures. I have had a handful of completely weird interactions on them already that makes me not even want to open the app much less use it. 

All anecdotal instances of course. I am a solid looking dude, have my shit together and am all for shooting guns and being happy a gay couple is getting married. A ""live and let live"" type. My crouch is virus free and I don't really plan on storming the capitol anytime soon. I'd like to say my interactions are just silly and random but I'd be a liar if I didn't also say to myself what gives?

I mean, I don't really wish being in your late-30s and single on anyone really. A lot of folks my age are in a crossroads part of life- I mean I'm not so different, I get it. But it brings about so many obstacles that I think I wasn't really prepared for. Being single for a year now and just getting back out into the wild world of dating having just moved across the country isn't ideal but I also don't know how to navigate it. Hell, does anyone?

Thanks for sticking around this long! My friend on the west coast suggested I give my thoughts, experiences and feelings instead of a quick few sentences to go with the mindset that it only takes one person to flip a light switch in your head and show you something you didn't know before and bam, suddenly you're having fun at a certain place or event, or with people who you'd get along with. I tend to be optimistic!

Sooo with that said... hi!! I am your long time friend who just moved here. Or your husbands brother who is new. A co-worker you like enough to wanna help settle in. I wanna learn Spanish, and guitar. I want to find random things to do and give myself chances to be happy. What advice are you giving me to settle in and meet people? What are the good comedy clubs to check out? Some weird oddity places or groups involved in a charity or focused thing for the community? There's surely someone reading this that relates to some degree and could benefit from the post also perhaps.

I Had a Crush on a Girl in HS let's say MARY.
I reached out Last November through FB and we met and Laughed for 5 hours at a Bar and Kissed our 1st Night together and next day talked on Phone for 5 hours then brought her Coffee at work Hour drive and then walked at a Park aftwr work for few hours and Kissed all these days... then it got slower to see her and she made excuses December that she had Family problems with her Grandma and something personal going on. I was Hurt and Prayed to God whatever happened let it be something I can fix or save the day in. 

New Years comes i tell her I Miss her and Hope she's OK. She tells me she misses me too and promises to Plan something. Then tells me she got into a Wreck and I offered to help fix it I did spent alot and had a quick date after. Then she worked on her days off till February (I can confirm), and I surprised her with Flowers Delivered and Food. She new it was me and after work I brought her so much stuff like a Teddy bear and just Valenties things. Maybe too much. Then coe is made. I promises that I would see her again and tell me that she's going through so much. I gave her space in april. Then 3 weeks later I Prayed to God, she would text me and she did right after lol she explained she was moving and got another Job, great. But still haven't seen her since. Then a Month ago I reached out and asked if she was OK and that I was praying for her. She thanked me sincerely and apologized for not giving me the time I deserved and just needed to work on herself for herself. No contact since. Today I wake up to her Snap showing she saw a Fight drinking beer with someone, a Guy just saw a Hand and was hurt. 

I didn't mention all the Signs I got this year I asked for if she'll Come back.

It's been a long journey so far but after firing our first contractor things are finally moving in the right direction! 

Unfortunately first contractor didn't send us any of the design files he was working off so we ended up spending this entire weekend learning how to use Chief Architect.  *We still suck*, but hopefully good enough to get the point across.  

Now we need some help figuring out how to lay out our dream kitchen! 

**Kitchen Concept:** The kitchen is U shaped with the fridge on the left due to two structural columns that will be hidden in the wall next to the fridge.  All designs shown have a square island to maximize the walkway on the sink wall but we did consider a couple of square islands as well. 

The fun part... We are taking in a small portion of our garage to create a 4 x 7 walk-in pantry and want to disguise the kitchen pantry door as an oversized wall to wall cabinet.  We are also extending the cabinets on the other side of the garage door where the dining room will be to create a coffee / bar / buffet counter top with some open shelving. 

**Concept Picture:** [https://imgur.com/K30HBan](https://imgur.com/K30HBan)

All Option Renders and plans: [https://imgur.com/a/uMV1mTk](https://imgur.com/a/uMV1mTk)

**What we need help deciding:  How to make the pantry door look best and keep the kitchen balanced.** 

Option 1: Pull the right cabinets 24"" out to create an appliance garage with counter top underneath it. Pantry door also comes out 24"" to be flush with this cabinet.  Standard 12"" cabinet on range counter.  Fridge side of kitchen has corner counter top. Window wall has no shelving. 

Option 2: Pull the left and right cabinets 24"" out to create two appliance garages... this is the same thing as option 1 but we've added another appliance garage there to maybe make it more balanced.   
  
Option 3: No appliance garages, use open shelving on window wall.  Pantry door would look like a pantry appliance panel but would be effectively flat against the wall.  We would add a dummy filler appliance panel on pantry wall next to pantry door. 

Option 4: We're working on this now but this would be basically to scrap the garage pantry bump out entirely and just mover the fridge next to the stove and use the current fridge cabinet area as a pantry (can add these soon)

But, the way I was living before that a week ago was honestly hell, i was lazy, I was unmotivated to do anything, I felt lethargic, I felt meh about things. Maybe Im still getting used to this drug, maybe it will wear off, maybe not. But so far, this has been a life saver for me. I feel more energetic than before, I can actually do chores now, yesterday I baked a pie, which is insane for me. I started going on walks, I try to eat healthier right now, and I can do my college homework easier. 

As for side effects, I haven't experienced any. First 3 days maybe some jitteriness like on high dose of coffee, but afterwards I was good.

I was on Concerta 36mg and Sertraline 25mg for some times.

My new psychiatrist noted that 36mg was not super effective so he bumped me to 54mg. Concerta 54mg made me constantly get sensory overloaded and anxious so we got back to 36mg and bumped Sertraline to 50mg.

The plan was to bump Sertraline to 75mg before trying Concerta 54 again but I waited a month more at 50mg. I felt there was something quite not right.

I'm slow with acknowledging my feelings and even slower at identifying them. Anxiety was OK but I noticed that I felt ""meh"". That ""meh"" is becoming more obviously ""meh"".

Typical day: I wake up, eat something with a cup of coffee. Take my meds (I still have some diazepam on top of it). I wait for half an hour and then I'm ""warmed up"", mostly feeling ready to tackle the day.

Since more than a month, I'm having a hard time to wake up and get up (can't remember shutting down my alarm) . I still do the usual routine but, then, I can wait as long as I want, I don't feel any ""warm up"". I just don't feel like doing anything. Even thinking about simple chores is like thinking about climbing a mountain. I still feel (mostly) OK coding random useless stuff. 

That's not the first antidepressant I had. In fact, I tried a bunch of them during the last 20 years. I've never been as depressed as when taking antidepressants.The best antidepressant I had, yet, is methylphenidate. Without antidepressants I'm too ""anxious"" to live a normal life, though. 

Weird.

I'm wondering if it is a common effect on ADHD or ASD or AuDHD that antidepressant can be actually depressing.

During my first week, one of my direct reports took me out for coffee and bragged about how she used to scream and yell at the previous manager. I was shocked.  When I spoke with my manager, she shrugged it off. What quickly became apparent is this person has a history of this behaviour along with performance issues that no one has talked to her about for fear of setting her off. She’s been with the company two and a half years and was
promoted during a period when the company was shortstaffed. 

I've been trying to give her feedback and she always gets aggressive. I have been reporting this to HR and my manager but they just tell me to keep trying. 

I am extremely uncomfortable around this person and it bothers me that my manager and HR aren't helping (nor did they help the previous manager. )

I have asked for an HR rep to join my next 1:1 with this person and they agreed. I want to use this meeting to share performance related feedback but should I also talk about her behaviour and how it makes me feel?

Our son is special needs so we've been trying to find a solid school district, and the feedback we've gotten from the CT special needs group has been helpful and many have said don't move for the school system because if admin changes (which it can frequently) then the once good programs could be defunded and what once was great could go down hill quick.

  
So with that said.... I'm trying to be balanced in approaching where to live and not basing it 100% on the school systems.

  
We currently are in Wolcott CT and we love our house, that that we're in the mountains, full of nature, privacy yet super friendly and helpful neighbors, and we have over half an acre and 1300 sqft in our house.... so it's very nice, plus that 3% interest rate is tough to give up. 

I'll be working in Bridgeport for the foreseeable future, and there's been other changes in our life that require us to move, so ideally I'd like a shorter commute if possible. My husband works in Wallingford/North Haven. 

  
We are a family of 3 with 6 pets and a pre-approval for a SFH of $350k and looking for city water houses as my husband is an auto tech and well water doesn't help when working on cars with their cooling systems as it can damage it and you can't wash your car with well water either or it leaves mineral deposits. 

Condo's are out of the question and so is renting with that many pets and our son's ASD (he can get loud), so we're looking for a single family home or even a multifamily if it made sense and got us into a good town.

  
**If you live in any of the towns listed below, I'd love to hear what it's like living there...**

- What are the people like (friendly, accepting, open minded, neighborly, or the opposite - judgmental, racist, sexist, elitist)

- Coffee shops, a book store, or nice restaurants (Husband is a big coffee nut, so any town with local coffee shops is a plus for him, and we're avid readers so a bookstore is nice but not a necessity)

- Any parks/playgrounds (if we end up with a house with a small yard, then having a local safe playground would be great. Dog parks are a plus but not a necessity)

- Your experience with the public schools if you have kids

- Safety of the town and for the crime what types of crime to be expected (I know auto crime's been up all through out CT, but our main concerns are about house break ins and violent crimes)

- Whether you'd move to that town if you had to live in a small house (some of the houses we've found in the more desired towns - trumbull/milford would have us in 648-884 sqft).

- We don't need any nightlife, we tend to be homebodies or enjoy parks/playground or nature trails, and the occasional trip to the coffee shop to hang out or work in is a bonus! 

- If anyone does have an ASD child, a town with supports in town or near by would also be a huge bonus (OT, Speech, etc.)!

- If you could move today, with a $350k budget, which town would you want to live in if you don't like your current town?

  
**Towns we're looking at:**

- Wallingford (some options that are fair for sqft/acreage)

- North Haven (options pop up but are gone quickly)

- Trumbull (648 sqft house nice yard no garage)

- Milford (768-884 sqft house practically no yard but there's a garage)

- Shelton (options pop up but are gone quickly)

- Branford (found some smaller but cute options here, don't know anything about the town)

- Newington (found some nice options here, don't know anything about the town)

- Southington (options pop up, but are gone quickly)

- Watertown (some options, but I've heard that it was one of the top towns that predominately voted for trump, and we'd like a more balanced town politically if possible as we want to not just be around people of one type of mind but rather a town that welcomes diversity of beliefs, values, politics, and discussion. Not here to debate politics, just saying we want a town that is welcoming of multiple viewpoints and a town that wouldn't write you off just based on your politics, gender, beliefs, religion, etc.)

- Beacon Falls (no properties right now, but saw some pop up a while ago but they were gone quickly. Don't know anything about the town)

- Berlin (every once in a while a property will show up in our range but it's gone quickly. Don't know too much about the town but heard the schools are great)

  
I've gotten feedback that Seymour, Ansonia, Derby, Bridgeport, Stratford, Hamden, West Haven, New Haven, and East Haven are not the best towns as well as the schools systems are not great or in some cases are dangerous (at least at high school level).

  
If there are any other towns we should keep our eyes on, please share!

We really want to make this a good long-term move (like 5-10 years at least if not longer) and want as much information as possible before making any offers on houses.

  
Thank you in advance for any light you can shed on the towns and any overall feedback! ",1,1728225035.0,Connecticut,69,0.53,False
1fxhqvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1fxhqvf/did_your_relationship_change_after_an_mcas_flare/,Did your relationship change after an mcas flare up? ,"For context I’m 24. I am fairly certain I have been having flare ups since I was a child. Still working on the actual diagnoses, just finished a 24 hour urine test. My whole life I have had these episodes of being violently sick and not able to stay awake my whole life that come with the hives, the stomach cramping and what I’m pretty sure is gastroparesis and comes with egg burps extreme fatigue and diarrhea once my stomach decided to work again. That started very young as well as reaction that would limited my ability to breathe and hives everywhere and I’d end up in the hospital. No one ever got it checked out. I didn’t put all the pieces together until this year. My dad had crohns so I assumed I’d just end up with that because he had all the same symptoms I have. It wasn’t until this year when I had a severe allergic reaction to a medication that all of the sudden I am allergic to everything. I got into a relationship with my now fiancé (25). Six years ago but I’d only have the episodes that lasted a couple days and I’d hide them from him because they were honestly embarrassing. I never thought I’d have an episode that lasted 7 months with only a couple brief days where I felt like a normal person again. I have gone atleast the past 3 years having only minor reactions to allergens like cats and dust. Everything else seemed to actually be getting better! Then 2 years ago I had my son, I started getting esophagus swelling when I’d eat bread or soy sauce (assuming it’s soy sauce because all the other ingredients are fine normally). I thought it was honestly that I wasn’t chewing food enough? Even then when I’d chew it to be very small it would get stuck and I’d get what felt like palpitations in my esophagus and crazy burping and I’d feel it slowly push and burn its way up my esophagus until I threw up everything. Now I have to chug water through the pain to push food down. I don’t have EOE though because I had an endoscopy done a couple months ago. Then I took this medication it gave me diarrhea, nausea, vomitting and I was passing out everytime I stood up but not losing consciousness just vision and hearing and my sense of where I am physically. I told my doctor this they thought it was a stomach bug upped my dose. First day of the new dose I got hives all over and the same nausea, diarrhea passing out. Benadryl wouldn’t even stop the hives. They were so severe and just kept going. So with feeling like this I haven’t been the most fun for really anyone. I get a lot more symptoms now but previously I lived such a normal life. I was a fun mom, and now I’m always a tired mom because I’m fucked if I eat I’m fucked if I don’t. Since this all started 7 months ago my boyfriend hasn’t really been supportive. The first couple weeks he did most of the stuff with our son. I keep having reactions and i work a full time job as well as taking care of our son when I’m not at work. He takes care of him when he’s not at work as well. When he’s sick I take care of our son pretty much fully on my own and him. To be fair though I’m sick a lot more with all of these reactions. I have to nearly starve myself to feel any better. I’ve asked him to help me more because I do most of the house things, I pay my car payment my phone bill our gas bill and our water bill he pays the rest. When I was healthy this was our agreement he pays most bills and I do most of the house work. Which wouldn’t be too bad if he just didn’t create more work for me to do by not finding dishes, or not cleaning out sippy cups that have milk in them. He’s also a bit forgetful. He will buy highly processed foods and food that have my allergens in them. My biggest trigger is yeast and sometimes he won’t read labels and will buy a coffee and pour me a cup and it’s literally a cup of my demise. After the first episode I had he seemed to just be resentful. He started to pick at everything, started to call me lazy. Which I have adhd as well so some things may appear lazy. Last night he told me “you have adderall that should replace the energy you lose so I don’t get why things are hard for you” first off my adhd is so bad that adderall literally makes me need a nap. He’s just like not listening at all to what I say to him and he honestly just seems like he doesn’t even love me anymore and just resents me for not being how I was before 7 months ago. I mean I lost 25 pounds in 2 months when this all started. I don’t even know how to fix it or if I even have the energy to fix it. I can barely eat anything as is. Going outside when pollen is high makes it all worse. I am just so tired. I feel like I’m fighting for my life half the time, my potassium and phosphate got really low from not being able to eat and from all of the diarrhea and I spent a couple months wondering if I was going to die from starving or from an allergic reaction. Maybe I’m just dramatic I don’t know. I just don’t have the energy to deal with this and the whole potential mcas thing. I have seen more doctors in these 7 months and they all send me to somewhere else. I’m tiredddd I’m hungry. I feel guilty, I’m not even a fun mom anymore. We used to go to the park all the time last year when my son was 1 and now i can’t really breathe when I go outside and I get hives from just a tree or grass touching me and breathing issues and dizzy as hell. I want to be a good mom again, I want to be a good girlfriend again. I want to eat again. Has anyone experienced this? ",3,1728224984.0,MCAS,2,1.0,False

I was the first adult on the scene. The event was traumatic as it started with a loud bang and I thought we were having a shooting at first. 

  
I literally quite heroically evacuated students. And then suffered smoke inhalation and wound up at the ER that night. Boss swept the whole thing under the rug to avoid bad PR. And he scolded me for swearing when I gave my witness account of the start of the fire (I was quoting a student, and the swear was ""shit""). 

He made students WITH BREATHING issues go back into the smoke filled building and remain on campus the rest of the day. I can't tell you...all my grievances. He also texts late making an emergency of his own poor planning. 

There are never any coffee cups. I had to drink coffee out of a bowl and my coworker laughed her ass off at me. 

I have so much work to do -- I have to plan for biology class, Marine Biology class and """"""Aquaponics"""""" class. That's three very different classes, I need more time and resources to plan for these. I'm exhausted. 

  
Are all schools like this?? A student at my son's school intentionally spat my son's allergen directly into his eyes like a fucking dilophosaurus. He had a severe reaction. He literally could have died. 

The nurse was off campus. The substitute nurse was off campus. No one would so much as give him Benedryl until a parent showed up.  The school dropped the ball in SO MANY ways. 

A few days later, they call me in a panic because my son allegedly ""forgot his lunch box"" in my car. After mobilizing several people in several locations into a panicked search for the damn lunch box, come to find out -- it was AT HIS SCHOOL UNDER ANOTHER KID'S BACKPACK. 

Same day, the vice princpal calls me and tells me I need to fill out a medical release form for my son to attend a field trip. She sends me THE WRONG form. She also asks me if I can chaperone the trip because, in her own words, her staff does not have the proper training to deal with my son's food allergies.  

Nah. Fuck all that. No free labor from me. If I'm going to have to take the day off to chaperone the trip, I might as well just keep my son home. I'd rather just chaperone my own son than a whole class of first graders.

Ha. Expertly calculated, Dr. Malcolm. 

In any case. On paper I love my job. But in practice I'm having a fucking panic attack all throughout the night as I contemplate going to work the next day. 

I gotta get the fuck outta here. I am literally getting regular chest pains. MAYBE IT'S FROM THE FUCKING SMOKE INHALATION. But it's probably from the stress. 

Maybe all this shit is just what happens when you idolize a god of chaos and a chaostitian. Or maybe chaos truly is just the nature of existence. 

Ideal job parameters: 

--Short commute

--50% face to face interaction (assisting clients in a way that feels productive, supportive, helpful and fulfilling), 50% desk work (planning/doing administrative tasks in a peaceful, quiet setting with clearly defined tasks and sufficient time to complete them. 

--Coworkers are respectful

--Boss is approachable 

--Reiterating -- assigned tasks are clearly defined. 

--Sufficient time and resources are allotted to assigned tasks.

--There is no work to take home. Work can be completed during business hours.

--Job is salaried and pays well

I was raised Catholic as a child, I grew up and throughout my teenage years I renounced Christianity. After my first year of university, I started to feel the pull of the Holy Spirit to go back to Church. At this point, I had moved countries, and couldn’t go back to my old Church. I went to a local Church not knowing what denomination it was - I then found out it was Pentecostal. I found a great community within this Church (I really love it) but sometimes I get upset or confused about the differences between Catholicism and Pentecostalism. 

My main two issues with this Pentecostal Church is whole crowds of people openly speaking in “tounges”. If you have read Corinthians 14:27, you understand what I mean. Pastors shouting into the crowd in tounges with no translator while groups of 100 speak in tounges at the same time. I find it unbiblical and it makes me feel very convicted. Same with reverence, I feel that Petecostal Churches can lack reverence, often making jokes. But, this does not mean I find the Catholic Church any better. 

(this view point was not developed based on what Pentecostals have said to me, this is purely based from my own research) I do not agree with praying to saints, we are told time and again that God is the only one we should pray too. I understand that Catholics do not worship Mary, but sometimes I feel like it can be a bit overdone to the point it’s borderline. I do not understand why I need to confess my sins to a priest, when God and I have an intimate relationship that does not need a “messenger”.

 I do not mean this in disrespect. I love the reverence and the tradition of the Catholic Church, but I also love the community and worship of Pentecostal Church’s. I love both, but also disagree with aspects of both. I am a baptised and confirmed Catholic and I feel like I am betraying the promise I made. 

I know that my personal relationship with God is most important, and that we are all his children no matter the denomination, but I feel like an outsider of both. I go mainly to the Pentecostal Church, but I do visit the Cathedral too. I feel like I can’t cut either Churches out of my life but I am full of conviction - for some people, denomination is the difference between salvation and not. I just need some clarity, I feel like I cannot go to leaders of either denominations about this because they are biased. 

EDIT: I forgot to mention, I am not just just a Sunday visitor to the Pentecostal Church. I attend young adults on Wednesdays, I am a youth leader on Fridays. I have Saturday morning coffees with my young adults girls. and every second Sunday I help run the kids Church. It definitely make it more complicated 😅",2,1728224857.0,Christianity,8,1.0,False

If you're looking to whiten your teeth, it's essential to choose safe methods that won't harm your enamel or gums. Let’s explore the **safest ways to achieve a dazzling smile** without compromising your dental health! 🌟

# 1. Professional Dental Whitening Treatments 🏥✨

The most effective and safest way to whiten your teeth is through professional treatments offered by your dentist.

* **In-Office Whitening**: This procedure involves applying a bleaching agent to your teeth and using a special light to enhance the whitening effect. Results are often visible in just one session!
* **Custom Take-Home Kits**: Your dentist can provide a customized whitening kit with a lower concentration of bleaching agent. You can use it at home for a gradual whitening effect.

**Benefit**: Professional treatments are safe, monitored by dental professionals, and provide the most dramatic results without damaging your teeth! 🦷💖

# 2. Over-the-Counter Whitening Products 🛒🌟

If you prefer at-home options, many over-the-counter (OTC) whitening products are safe and effective. Look for products with the American Dental Association (ADA) Seal of Acceptance. Some popular choices include:

* **Whitening Toothpaste**: These contain mild abrasives and special chemical agents to help remove surface stains. They typically don’t change the natural color of your teeth but can help maintain brightness.
* **Whitening Strips**: Thin, flexible strips coated with a peroxide-based whitening gel. Follow the instructions carefully for optimal results.
* **Whitening Gels and Pens**: These are applied directly to the teeth and can be convenient for touch-ups.

**Benefit**: OTC products are easy to use and can provide noticeable results with consistent application! 💪🪥

# 3. Natural Remedies 🍋✨

If you prefer a more natural approach, several home remedies can help whiten your teeth safely, though results may vary.

* **Baking Soda and Hydrogen Peroxide**: A paste made from baking soda and hydrogen peroxide can act as a mild abrasive and a bleaching agent. Use it sparingly—once a week is sufficient to avoid enamel damage.
* **Activated Charcoal**: Some people use activated charcoal to absorb stains. However, be cautious; it can be abrasive, so use it occasionally and ensure thorough rinsing afterward.
* **Apple Cider Vinegar**: When diluted with water, it can help remove stains, but it should be used sparingly due to its acidity. Always rinse your mouth with water afterward!

**Benefit**: These natural remedies can be cost-effective and are less harsh than some commercial products! 🌿💧

# 4. Maintain Good Oral Hygiene 🧼🦷

Keeping your teeth clean and healthy is essential for maintaining their whiteness.

* **Brush Twice Daily**: Regular brushing removes surface stains and prevents new ones from forming. Use fluoride toothpaste to protect your enamel.
* **Floss Daily**: Flossing helps remove food particles and plaque that can lead to staining.
* **Regular Dental Check-Ups**: Professional cleanings can help remove tartar and surface stains, keeping your smile bright!

**Benefit**: Good oral hygiene habits prevent discoloration and contribute to overall dental health! 🏅🌟

# 5. Limit Staining Foods and Beverages 🍷🚫

Certain foods and drinks can contribute to tooth staining.

* **Common Culprits**: Coffee, tea, red wine, berries, and sodas can leave stains on your teeth. If you indulge, try to rinse your mouth with water afterward or use a straw for beverages to minimize contact with your teeth.
* **Healthy Alternatives**: Crunchy fruits and vegetables like apples and carrots can help naturally scrub your teeth while you eat!

**Benefit**: Being mindful of what you consume can prevent future stains and maintain your whitening efforts! 🍏🥕",1,1728224711.0,u_Dr_KhushbooSoni,0,1.0,False

34m 155lbs 5'10.  No medications and no medical diagnosis. 

Backstory is that a constellation of symptoms happened after covid in Jan 2023. Everything from chest pain to GI issues, brain fog to fatigue. This was vert disturbing because I was ultramarathon runner, good shape, competitive in my job, etc. Really set me back.

I chased diagnosis for a while but things slowly returned to normal. Lasting issues are persistent headaches, some chest pain and shortness of breath in the morning. It's like my body has forgotten how to inhale properly. After I get a coffee on me and ""warm the body up"" it seems to improve.

SPO2 is 99 consistently.

Headaches I've been told are stress, chest pain non-cardiac, but nobody can offer why I have SoB. Recently did 17 METs during a stress echo and could have kept going but was pulled off at target HR to get the echo images. EF 63%, Cardiac CT score 0.... PFT ""normal"". Bloodwork all normal.

I'm looking for any suggestions?

I use a sleep tracker and it seems like I have normal sleep and no sensing of apnea.

1fxhkd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1fxhkd7/update_im_freaking_out_because_i_have_my_first/,UPDATE: I'm freaking out because I have my first T4T date tonight ...,"Okay ... some of you asked for an update after I made [THIS POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1fwr3am/comment/lqlptl6/?context=3). So here goes!

I picked her up at her place and we went for coffee. We ended up sitting there talking for about two and a half hours and it was WONDERFUL! She was so nice and pretty and interesting and empathetic and reaffirming. She told me I was pretty several times and it made me want to cry every time.

We have a lot of shared interests, particularly table top gaming. So we ended up talking about that quite a bit. Also talked a lot about families and our personal journeys with transitioning. She is much further along than me. She has already completed laser and has been on HRT and, believe me, the bewb fairies were most generous with her. I just started laser on my face and neck last month and won't start HRT until early next year, but there was a time or two when she looked me up and down and commented that HRT will probably be REALLY GOOD to me. But it was soooooooo nice to be able to open up and talk about life on such a personal level without fear of being judged.

Like I said in my previous post ... this was my first T4T date and the first date I've been on since coming out. Being with somebody who had so many shared experiences and talking to somebody who knows me only as Leah ... I was so happy with her and I did not want the date to end. But I had to cut it short because I needed to pick my daughter up from work.

I'm on the short end of 5-5 and I thought she was going to be maybe a foot taller than me, but she wore these boots that made her tower over me and OMFG what a goddess! She's got a little bit of a goth thing going on and she was wearing a very low cut top. We hugged several times and, because of the height difference, you'll only need one guess to figure out where my face naturally went.  Pre-coming out, everyone I dated was either slightly shorter or slightly taller than me (by like a half-inch). She had to have been over me by 12-14 inches and my brain short-circuited every time we hugged. And I wanted so badly to kiss her at the end, but I was never in a situation in which I could just easily lean in to initiate it. I think I just stood there giving her sad puppy dog eyes at the end because I didn't know how to handle the moment.

We are definitely going to see each other again. She said she won't be able to next weekend but said she wants us to definitely plan for the following weekend. And we were right back to messaging each other last night after the date ended.

I do want to say ... I know a lot of people in this thread really want to find somebody. I know being trans is hard, let alone dating while trans. Don't ever stop trying or looking. Seriously ... don't ever give up. Get involved in anything LGBTQ+ related in your community so you can meet people. It can take some insane level of searching. Trust me, I know. But people like us are in EVERY community, even the reddest of the red. It is worth it in the end. Even if this beautiful woman and I never go out on another date, this one that we did was a real eye-opener for me about how important it is to get out and socialize and live your fucking life.
