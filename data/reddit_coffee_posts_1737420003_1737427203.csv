I bought a Philips Series 2200 in late 2021 and ever since then I've always had one particular issue with the nozzle most likely and and I've had to get it repaired four times in total, three of these times under warranty and the fourth one in July 2024, not covered by it.

The issue is that when I make espresso, the machine starts grinding the coffee beans and then there are three possible outcomes: 

* Nothing comes out. When it happens I make a second espresso and it works, but other times it take more grinds and it's a waste of coffee beans. In July it just stopped no matter how many times I tried
* Coffee comes out but it's  literally dripping and takes ages to finish
* Normal flow, which is rare

Because of this inconsistency I don't know what to do. My parents want me to take it to get fixed once again but considering that I took it in July already and started having the same issue just five months later, I don't think it's worth, also considering the cost of it.

Do you think the problem is the nozzle? I watched a Youtube video where he fixed a leaking nozzle. Should I follow the same steps but then try to clean the tube that take the coffee to the nozzle?

Could this be due to dry air/static? If so, is now the time to experiment with spritzing my beans prior to grinding them? Or are there better ways to deal with this.   
  
An alternative (but seemingly less likely) explanation is that I cleaned my burrs for the first time in years. Could getting rid of years of coffee dust on my burrs make it more likely that fines make it through to my cup?

","To give you guys some context, I (19M) met my current boyfriend (28M) one year and three months ago while I was living abroad in his home country for three months. When I came back, we started a long-distance relationship. Eight months ago (during long distance), he asked me to be his boyfriend. We started to discover everything about each other while being apart. We met twice because he came to visit me in my home country. I had some concerns about our relationship because of our age difference, and I experienced some anxiety and overthinking while being with him, but nothing overwhelming.

A month ago, I went to live abroad for another three months. During that time, I met his family, his friends, and got to know his everyday life. In my last week there, I asked to watch Netflix on his iPad while he wasn’t home. That’s when I saw websites in his history where he had been sexting other people. The website was for cruising and meeting men. It allowed users to watch porn, text, video chat, send pictures, and arrange discreet meetups. I read his chats, and they were explicit—he asked for pictures and engaged in sexual conversations. He told me he never physically met anyone, and I believed him. We had previously discussed what we considered cheating, and I had been clear about my boundaries.

When I confronted him, he was upset. We talked about it multiple times, and I struggled with my emotions. We later had a therapy session, where I decided to break up with him. His reaction was, “I can’t believe you’re ending this over some texts.” At the time, I had nowhere else to stay, so he left his apartment, and I remained there. While staying there, I experienced intense sadness, missing him constantly, shaking, and crying. Two days later, I reached out to him and suggested meeting for coffee, considering the possibility of a second chance.

At the café, we set boundaries. He told me he would quit porn, delete all his accounts on porn websites, and remove Snapchat (I’m unsure if he deleted Twitter as well). He said he had an unhealthy relationship with porn but was willing to change to rebuild our relationship. He reassured me that he would work to regain my trust.

After returning to my home country, I later found out that he was still watching pornography on a different website. This discovery led me to question whether anything would change. That night, I went to a small party and drank too much. A guy there was flirting with me, but I didn’t pay attention to him—just as I had ignored others in similar situations.

At one point, I went to the bathroom, and two minutes later, someone knocked. Thinking it was my cousin, I opened the door, but it was the guy from the party. He grabbed my waist, and we started kissing. The thought of my boyfriend came while I was kissing him and pushed the guy away, telling him to leave. I became overwhelmed, started crying, and later threw up. The next day, I told my boyfriend what had happened.

He didn’t respond for a week. When we started talking again, I began experiencing panic attacks and heightened anxiety. He was angry, and two weeks later, he continues to avoid me, even though he says he wants us to move forward.

I’m not sure how to handle the situation. I’ve been feeling overwhelmed, and my anxiety is affecting my daily life.

I Met a Stranger Today



A Story by Daniel Melo

I met a stranger today, a nice young man at a coffee shop in my small town. Not a very large town in the heart of England but yet a well dressed man that would display his wealth. Accounted by his slicked hair and clean appearance wearing a three piece suit he would only bring me to think of someone I once knew. I don’t remember these frail days strolling these stone paths hoping I don’t get lost in the suffrage of my dementia. I sent my family away to America for a better and more wealthy life in the 1970’s but by the 1980’s they’ve stopped sending letters. I only receive letters from someone I don’t remember but someone who yet I feel connected too. I still wonder in the waves my dementia progresses with. Though this young man reminds me of him, I just don’t know how. In the letters the writer would always explain their riches and how they’d love to share them with me. Though I’d love the riches, a chipper as he would only want something from me. I’ve just never known what. In the scent of the coffee, tea, and pastries only the man stands out. I’ve placed my order but I don’t remember what I ordered, a faint memory tells me the lady who took my order knew me. Oh yes, Maria was her name. A sweet little girl she’s always been. She comes from a nice family too, not a family of riches but of a good heart. 

The young man has come up to me, a nice long beige coat spanning down to his knees trailing behind him everywhere he stepped. The slicked hair and navy blue suit that completed his look. A lawyer I’d presume, I just don’t know why any of his vast looking wealth would be doing in a town like this.

“Madam Carlile?” The man asked me with a soft voice,

“Oh yes, I’m sorry I don’t remember you.”

I struggle to remember what he said but he explained from my memory of his trying to chase something, I just don’t remember what. I seem to have forgotten his name too. I feel ashamed of that.

“I’ve lived a life of joy and content but after I sent my family away I only felt alone. A big world and nobody to share it with. My husband passed long ago, too long to remember. I feel guilty of that. Oh how I feel guilty of many things. I’ve lived a life of only guilt and sorrow.” I told the gentlemen as he sipped on his coffee.

“I know how you feel, I’ve wronged many people and myself in many ways of life. I’ve turned my back against what was only there to help me and only found that out when it was gone. In life we can only move on. Letting these guilts trap us in their endless hold will keep us from our greatest potentials.” The gentlemen said with a heart of love, almost like he cared about me.

“My daughter was an amazing woman before I sent her to America, I only received letters from her, giving me a small glimpse of her life not so different from the one she left behind. It pains me to hear that from her. I haven’t heard from her in a while, I sure hope she sends another one of her letters inviting me to her findings.” I said as the young man began to tear. “I’m sorry, have I said something that hurt you? I may have not noticed it in my dementia, my mind is uncontrollable these days.” I said, holding his arm as he wiped his tears.

“No it’s just, well… she must have been a nice woman.” He said.

I began humming to the vinyl records I keep at home of the piano symphonies from my grandson in America. The young man gave a brief smile, 

“I’ve always liked to pour my life into a piano and let it dance along the sounds and rings like bells in a church. It brings peace and joy to me.” He told me with the returning smile, again the feeling of knowing him washed over me but unknowing why.

“The endless suns will shine high and die in their most beautiful exposure before I am enough with these days in this world.” I said looking out the window forgetting he was there.

“Life will never be enough for any of us. No matter how many days we are given we just never feel ready to go.” He said quietly.

“A friend once told me ‘Ζήσε τη ζωή στο έπακρο, γιατί δεν θα φέρει κάθε όνειρο πριν από την προκαθορισμένη μας ημέρα. Μπορούμε μόνο να χωρέσουμε τόσα πολλά στις ζωές μας πριν τα εύθραυστα σώματά μας δεν αντέχουν άλλο.’ Before they left on a journey they never returned from.” I told the man,

“Live life to the fullest for it will never bring every dream before our destined day, we can only crowd so much into our lives before our frail bodies and handle no more.” He translated.

“You speak Greek?” I asked the man,

“Some.” He replied with a soft voice as he looked at me.

I was given my meal from Maria and we continued our conversations. Even she could remember his name but it faded quickly from my mind.

“Ms. Carlile, you may not know much about me but I want to take you around your life as a final stroll. I know you may not remember me well if not at all but I want our final times to be memorable.” He said standing above me and reaching out for my hand.

I took his hand and we left the cafe and began walking through the street.

He’s such a kind young man. Always so patient with me. I don’t quite remember his name, though I feel like I should. But that doesn’t seem to bother him. He just smiles as he helps me down the street into his car. The ride is quiet at first, but not awkward. I glance out the window, watching the trees blur together, and a strange feeling wells up in me like I’ve been here before, like I’ve known him longer than I can remember. When we arrive at the park, my breath catches. It’s familiar in a way that fills me with warmth.

“I know this place,” I say, more to myself than to him. The words come out slow, like I’m testing them.

He doesn’t say much, just nods and offers me his arm as we walk along the path. Then I see it, the old oak tree by the pond. My heart skips.

“That tree,” I whisper. “I used to come here with my children. We’d spread a blanket right there under the shade… and my little boy, he loved to climb it. Oh, he’d laugh so much.”

The memory feels sharp and vivid, like a sunbeam breaking through a cloud. For a moment, I can almost hear his laughter echoing in the breeze.

We sit down on a bench, and I can’t help but turn to the young man beside me. There’s something about him. Something familiar.

“You remind me of someone,” I tell him. “Someone I used to know. He had kind eyes, just like yours.”

He smiles, but there’s something behind it. A weight I can’t quite place. “Maybe it’s a coincidence,” he says softly. I laugh, shaking my head.

“Or maybe I just see what I want to see these days. Either way, I’m glad you’re here.”

The little antique shop is tucked away on a quiet street, the kind of place I could spend hours in when I was younger. I walk slowly, taking my time to touch the old books and faded trinkets. Then I see it, a silver locket resting in a glass case.

My breath hitches. “Oh… this locket,” I whined, reaching out to point at it. “It’s just like the one Charles gave me for our anniversary. My Charles…”

The memories flood back, soft and sweet.

“He was such a romantic, you know. Did I ever tell you about the time he filled a whole room with roses? Just for me.”

The young man nods, his smile warm and understanding.

“He sounds like a wonderful man,” he says.

I look at him then, really look at him.

“Oh, he was. You would’ve liked him. And you know what? I think he would’ve liked you, too.”

The sun has set by the time we reach the square, the cobblestones glowing under the soft light of the streetlamps. Somewhere nearby, a musician is playing a saxophone, the melody drifting through the air like an old, familiar friend.

I stop in my tracks, listening. My heart aches not in a bad way, but in a way that reminds me of how full it has been.

“Charles and I used to dance to music like this,” I say, looking up at the young man. “Right here, in this square. It feels like forever ago.”

He offers his hand, and I blink at him, surprised. “Would you like to dance?” he asks.

I laugh, shaking my head. “Oh, don’t be silly. My old bones can’t handle that anymore.”

But he doesn’t take no for an answer. “You don’t have to do much. Just follow my lead,” he says, his voice soft and encouraging. And so I do. He holds me gently, guiding me as we sway to the music. It feels like a dream, like stepping into a memory I didn’t know I still had.

“You’re a fine dancer,” I tell him with a smile. “Have I told you that?”“Not yet,” he says, and there’s a glint of something in his eye, something I can’t quite name.

For the first time in a long while, I feel light. Free. The aches in my body, the fog in my mind, all seem to fade into the rhythm of the music.

As the song ends, I thank him, my heart full.

“You’ve given me a wonderful day,” I say. “It feels like… like I’ve found pieces of myself again. You don’t know how much that means to me.”

“I think I do,” he replies, his voice quiet but sure.

We went to bed that night and he tucked me in, I don’t know why but it made me feel like a kid again. It was soothing for me. This seemingly stranger person treated me as if I were their own family.

I journeyed off to the cafe today and while I was there a nice young man walked in dressed luxuriously for a town as small as this… Oh, I’ve already written this. It seems my dementia has struck me again. Maria asked me about the young man whose name I still don’t know. She called home and had him come get me from the cafe.

We’ve headed off in the car to a place I don’t know, but as we got closer I began to remember some of the things here, the structures. The trees, and my my, it was my home from childhood. We came to see the neighbourhood and the young man said I tried opening the front door and calling my mother but I don’t remember any of it. It just seems to be another moment of my dementia progressing. I don’t think I have long now, reading through these notes I’ve written I’m still unknowing of this man’s name. I want to find out his name tonight. We journeyed through the neighbourhood as the children played. It reminded me of when I was here as a child. My mum calling me indoors for supper and making toys out of seemingly random objects.

“Do you remember any of this?” The man asked,

“I do, this was all my childhood.” I responded to him.

He then gave me an odd look, I wasn’t sure what it was about until I realised what was hours later, I had awoken in the hospital to the man speaking with a doctor. The doctor entered the room and began talking to me.

“Hello Madam, I am Doctor Morgan. Unfortunately yesterday you had an aneurysm in your thigh, we were able to repair the damages however it has caused some damages.”

“How much?” The man asked when we walked into the room, still wearing the same clothes.

“I’m extremely sorry to have to tell you this sir.” The Doctor said before my mind fogged, I couldn’t get any more.

“Ready for another adventure?” he asked, smiling in that way of his, the kind of smile that made you feel like everything was going to be okay.

I nodded, though I wasn’t entirely sure what the day would bring. That had become a familiar feeling lately, the uncertainty. It was like standing at the edge of a foggy road, unable to see more than a few meters ahead. But he made it easier somehow, like having a lantern to guide the way.

We drove in comfortable silence, the kind that didn’t need filling. I watched the world pass by outside the window, trees and houses blurring together, and felt a strange pull in my chest. It wasn’t sadness exactly, more like longing. A feeling that I’d been here before, though I couldn’t quite remember when.

Our first stop was a small art gallery tucked away on a quiet street. The halls were quiet and cool, the walls lined with paintings and photographs that seemed to whisper stories of other times, other lives. I found myself drawn to a painting of a garden, the colors so vivid they seemed to bloom off the canvas.

“I know this,” I murmured, tilting my head as I studied the brushstrokes. “I used to have roses like these… I think.”

“You did,” he said softly, standing just behind me. “You loved your garden.”

His certainty startled me. I turned to look at him, but he was focused on the painting, his expression unreadable. I let it go, though the thought lingered. It was nice, being with someone who seemed to know me so well, even when I didn’t.

Later, as we strolled through the town square, I felt a sudden urge to stop by the bakery on the corner. The scent of fresh bread wafted through the open door, warm and inviting, and before I knew it, I was heading inside.

“I need to get bread,” I said over my shoulder. “Charles likes fresh bread with dinner.”

I didn’t notice him catch up to me until his hand rested gently on my shoulder.

“Madam,” he said softly, his voice steady but kind, “Charles isn’t here anymore.”

The words stopped me cold. For a moment, I didn’t understand. And then it hit me, the memory rushing back like a cold wind. The hospital. The quiet house. The empty space where he used to sit.

“Oh,” I whispered, my cheeks flushing. “I’m sorry. I don’t know what I was thinking.”

“It’s okay,” he said, his hand still on my shoulder, grounding me. “Let’s keep going. There’s more to see.”

By the time the sun set, the town had transformed. The main street was alive with music and laughter, tables lined up under strings of twinkling lights. The smell of grilled food filled the air, mingling with the sweetness of baked pies and the faint scent of flowers from the nearby stalls.

We found a table on the patio of a small café overlooking the festivities. He ordered for both of us, and as we ate, I watched the people passing by. Children darting between tables, lovers swaying to the rhythm of a lively tune.

“It’s beautiful,” I said, resting my chin in my hand. “It reminds me of the town fairs we used to have when I was young. Everyone would come together like this… It feels like a lifetime ago.”

“It is beautiful,” he agreed, though there was something in his tone I couldn’t quite place.

“You’re quiet tonight,” I said, studying him. “What’s on your mind?”

“Nothing important,” he replied quickly, though his eyes told a different story.

I let it go, my attention drawn to the band as they struck up a familiar melody. It was the kind of music that made you want to move, to hold someone close and sway under the stars.

“I wish I could dance again,” I said wistfully, half to myself.

To my surprise, he stood and held out his hand.

“Then let’s dance,” he said simply.

I laughed, shaking my head. “Oh, you’re determined to keep me young, aren’t you?”

“You’ve always been young at heart,” he said, his smile warm and steady.

So I let him guide me to the edge of the square, where couples swirled and swayed under the fairy lights. He held me gently, his movements slow and careful, as if he knew how fragile I was. For a moment, I felt weightless, the years melting away with every step.

“You’re a fine dancer,” I told him with a smile. “Have I told you that?”

“Not yet,” he said, his eyes glinting with something I couldn’t quite name.

The music slowed, the last note lingering in the air as we made our way back to the table. The day felt fuller, richer somehow, like we had squeezed an entire lifetime into those precious hours.

The drive home was quiet, the kind of quiet that wrapped around you like a soft blanket. I leaned my head against the window, watching the lights of the town fade into the distance.

“It was a good day,” I said softly, more to myself than to him.

“It was,” he replied, his voice steady, though I caught the faintest quiver in it.

When we got back to the house, he helped me up the steps and into my room. As I settled into bed, I looked up at him and smiled.

“You’re a good boy,” I said. “I don’t know what I’d do without you.”

“You don’t have to,” he said, brushing a strand of hair from my face.

I watched him as he turned off the light and closed the door behind him. The darkness settled around me, warm and comforting, and for the first time in a long while, I felt at peace. I didn’t know what tomorrow would bring, but for tonight, it was enough.

The morning came gently, sunlight filtering through the curtains and casting warm streaks across the walls. I could hear his voice before I saw him, low and steady, carrying through the thin walls of the house.

“I don’t know if this is right, Don,” he said. “She doesn’t even know who I am. Sometimes I wonder if it’s cruel, taking her through all of this when she...” His voice trailed off, heavy with something I couldn’t quite place.

Don. That was who he was talking to. I wondered briefly who Don might be—an old friend? A confidant? Whoever it was, they seemed important to him.

I sat up slowly, my hands smoothing over the blanket as I tried to piece together where I was and who he might be. The fog in my mind was thicker than usual this morning, my thoughts like scattered papers caught in the wind.

He noticed I was awake and quickly ended his call, slipping the phone into his pocket.

“Good morning,” he said, his smile warm but tinged with something that felt like worry.

“Good morning,” I replied, studying him for a moment. “I’m sorry, but... who are you again?”

The look in his eyes was brief but unmistakable—a flicker of pain, quickly masked by kindness.

“I’m just here to keep you company,” he said softly, his voice steady as he pulled up a chair beside the bed. “How did you sleep?”

I nodded, though I wasn’t sure if it was true. It was hard to tell these days.

As the hours passed, the fog refused to lift. I found myself asking the same questions over and over. What day was it? Where were we going? And each time, he answered with unshakable patience, his voice calm and gentle, as though he had all the time in the world.

The next day felt heavier, the air thick with something unspoken. He told me we would be meeting people from the town and some family that still lived nearby. Family. The word felt strange on my tongue, like it didn’t belong to me anymore. We spoke to people around town and they gave me a goodbye that I have never been given before. As if they knew something was going to happen. I did too.

The church bells rang out as we arrived, their deep, resonant chimes echoing through the small stone streets. The faces that greeted me were kind and familiar, though I couldn’t place their names. Some hugged me, others simply held my hand and smiled, their eyes full of something I didn’t quite understand.

He stayed close to me, his presence steady and reassuring as we sat together in the old wooden pews. The service was quiet and beautiful, the hymns stirring something deep inside me, though I couldn’t name it. I found myself reaching for his hand, and he held mine without hesitation, his grip firm and steady. When the service ended, we lingered outside the church, the late afternoon sun casting long shadows across the cobblestone streets. The others talked and laughed, their voices blending into a comforting hum. I stayed close to him, the weight of the day pressing down on me like a heavy quilt.

As the evening drew near, we returned home, the house quiet and still. He helped me to my room, his movements careful and deliberate, as though I might shatter under the slightest pressure.

“Thank you,” I said as I settled into bed. “For today. It was nice.”

“It was,” he said, his voice soft but firm.

I looked up at him, my eyes searching his face. There was something familiar about him, something that felt like home, though I couldn’t place it.

“You remind me of someone,” I murmured, my voice trailing off as sleep began to pull me under.

“Who?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

“I’m not sure,” I said, my words slurring as my eyes drifted shut. “But... you feel like family.”

As he shut the light and was about to close the door.

“Conner.” I said tearfully, “Your name is Conner. My Grandson.”

He fell into a pit of tears and came back into the room giving me a hug he has not given me yet.

“You are my Grandson.” I repeated with tears streaming down my face.

“Yes, I am.” Conner said not letting go.

“Where are your parents?” I asked,

“They died, 7 years ago. I’m sorry for not coming sooner.” He said quietly,

“Oh don’t be dear, don’t be sorry. You are here now and that’s all that matters.” 

“You’re not going to wake up in the morning.” He said with sadness,

“I know. But it’s okay, my time has come.” I said to him, running my fingers through his hair.

“Goodbye, Grandma. Tell my parents I love them.” 

“I will.” I said as I slid back under the covers of my bed and Conner turned off the lights. 

This is a moment, no matter how strong or how far my dementia, I will not forget it.

“Goodbye, Conner. Look up to the moon tonight.” I said as a final goodbye slipping into my sleep.



	Today is March 3rd of 1993, I went into my grandmother’s bedroom this morning and she did not wake. Her skin was cold to the touch. Goodbye Grandma. Days later we led her funeral, Don came to the funeral as well.

“Conner?” 

“Hi, Don.” I said,

“Yet another funeral.”

“Yet another,” I responded back.

“Today we celebrate the next chapter of Carlile Cooper, she has moved on to the next chapter of her existence in the presence of God. God who has received another angel.” The funeral director said as he pulled out a bible. “Revelations 21:4, He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”

“I’ve had enough funerals already.” Don said with a giggle.

“Me too.” I said back as we buried my grandmother tossing the dirt over the grave.

After finishing with the funeral ceremony Don returned to America. I still have a few things to settle here, before I return. I’m just not sure I can bring myself to do them.



I woke up to a shining light in my eyes and I lay on some floor. Awoken by 2 people. Finding myself in the endless grass I felt no more pain in my bones and my mind felt clear, I climbed to my feet better than I ever have before. I turned around and saw them.

“Oh my sweet Evelyn. Michael. Oh but Conner said you were dead?” I said to my daughter and son-in-law.

“Mom.” Evelyn said with her American accent.

“Oh, I see.” I said looking around and seeing the one fruit tree in the middle of the garden.

TW SA,"I just had my first actual gay date, and I’m trying to process how it went. I’m 24, gay, and live in a rural community, so I don’t have much experience with dating outside of a few hookups in college. He’s the same age but had a 5-year relationship before this.

We met on Tinder and chatted on and off for a month, but he was pretty hot and cold. After he ditched plans a couple of times, I ended it, but the next day he messaged me on Facebook, apologized, and said he wanted to try seriously. I decided to give it a chance.

We planned a casual date: coffee, thrifting, and then hanging out at his place. When we met, it was awkward but not horrible. I was happy that I was able to be myself and not shutdown from the nerves. Then, he shared that he grew up nearby and had known who I was the whole time we had been talking, he knew my extended family, we had played sports against eachother as kids etc… which was surprising because he never mentioned any of this before and I didn’t recognize him until he said it. Thrifting was okay—he seemed introverted, and I tried to keep things light. At one point, I joked about a board game called “Wet Heads,” and he replied, “Is that what you’re going to give me later?” which felt bold given how quiet he’d been.

Then we went back to his apartment, and things took a turn. I hadn’t smoked weed in years but agreed to try it because he smoked often. We went to his room, and he closed the door, turned off the lights, and put on Landslide by Fleetwood Mac. I took a couple of puffs, and then he asked about my coming out story. I gave him the short version and asked about his.

He shared that his parents cut him off after coming out, which was heartbreaking, and then he told me about some deeply traumatizing experiences involving SA. I panicked and said, “I would recommend therapy.” He laid down on his mattress and said, “Therapy?” in a tone that felt angry, I kind of got jumbled up and shared that it has been very helpful for me. Then he invited me to lay down with him, and at that point, everything hit me—the weed, the dark room, the music, his trauma—and I felt completely overwhelmed. I made an excuse to leave and went home, where I ended up crying.

I later sent him a message explaining that I panicked and that I wasn’t in the right headspace to process everything. I told him I admire his bravery in sharing and that I hope he gets support to process everything. I also said I need time to think.

Now, I’m questioning myself. He’s obviously been through a lot and deserves kindness, but we didn’t exactly have chemistry and it felt like a big overshare for the first fate. I thought it was supposed to be more fun and lighthearted. Am I a bad person if I distance myself from him? Is this sort of experience common in gay dating?

But lately I have been rethinking this, because I go on dates with women from dating apps and I am usually the pursuer. Majority of them won’t initiate first or would wait for the other to initiate the date, so I naturally end up taking this role. While I genuinely do not mind treating them on a date, I realize that I need to be more mindful with my finances. Figured that I should just ask them on coffee/ice cream dates instead but eating good food is a pleasure of mine lol.

Perhaps that rule of etiquette would mainly apply IRL and is different when meeting others on dating apps? what are your thoughts? how do you go about this If you’re always the initiator? ",1,1737426149.0,AskLesbians,1,1.0,False

*trigger warning: binge-eating*

Hi everyone,

I am a volume eater and I graze too much in between meals. Historically I (33F) do not have a healthy relationship with food. I have been overweight all my life and have PCOS. Never limited myself in the carbs/sugar department until now.

I’ve been at low carb about 1.5 weeks now and can honestly say I am really enjoying it - never once thought I’d say that about a diet! 

I’ve had no cheat days, and proud to say I have been cooking at home a LOT more, challenging myself to plan and prepare new low carb recipes, and choosing to eat more whole foods than before. 

I’ve only ordered Skip once last week (whereas before it was every other day..) and that was to order a chicken salad at work when I was really hungry and had no low carb snacks on me.

I have noticed no real difference on the scale or how I look, however.. trying not to be too discouraged and be patient as I know it takes time. Consistency is key with weight loss, as I’ve been told.

This being said, I suspect I am eating too many calories.. I haven’t really been tracking anything, just focusing on eating low carb foods.

Things I’ve been eating in rotation the last week:

- meat and eggs (chicken wings, bacon, sausage, ground beef)

- full fat dairy: cheese, heavy cream, no sugar coffee creamer, plain Greek yogurt, cream cheese, Premier Protein drinks

- veggies (Broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, dill pickles, romaine lettuce - Caesar salad, avocado/guacamole)

- fruit (berries)

- sweeteners (stevia, monk fruit)

- Orowheat wraps 

- sugar free versions of condiments (mustard, homemade buffalo sauce - Franks red hot & butter, ketchup, BBQ sauce, full fat ranch)

- nuts and oils (pecans, avocado oil, butter)

- snacks: Quest chips, no sugar chocolate chips, peanut butter cup fat bombs, sugar free vanilla pudding, Love Good Fats bars, Diet Pepsi 

My question is: What are your go-to low carb/keto recipes that are good for volume eating - where you can eat a lot of it, feel satiated for awhile, and not have to worry too much about calories?

I know I need to cut out the snacking/grazing in between meals if I want to see some better progress..

I am also thinking fasting would be a good idea .. I just really hate being hungry though. I find when I am hungry, I’m more likely to binge-eat and spiral, completely throwing out my progress. This is why I’d love some ideas of volume eater friendly recipes that I can have prior to going into a fast.

Any feedback or advice is welcomed and appreciated - Thank-you! ",1,1737425795.0,lowcarb,0,1.0,False

Various studies indicate the efficacy of omega-3 in lessening ADHD symptoms by improving one's ability to focus, enhancing memory, and generally boosting cognitive performance. Omega-3 supports the functioning of brain cells, enhances neurotransmitter activities, and reduces inflammation-all of which can benefit ADHD sufferers.  
  
Key Benefits:  
  
Improves focus and attention  
Supports memory and cognitive function  
Reduces brain inflammation  
Omega-3 supplements are easily found over the counter, and as described above, Omega-3 is a great natural alternative if one seeks non-medication to control ADHD symptoms.  
2. Ginkgo Biloba: Improved Cognitive Performance  
  
Ginkgo Biloba is one of the most popular herbal supplements, which is quite effective in improving memory and cognitive function. It has been used in traditional medicine for centuries to improve brain health. Research suggests that Ginkgo Biloba can help improve focus, concentration, and mental clarity, making it an excellent choice for those with ADHD.  
  
Ginkgo works by increasing blood flow to the brain, which may help improve attention span and overall brain function. It also has antioxidant properties, which protect brain cells from oxidative stress, further supporting mental clarity.  
  
Key Benefits:  
  
Improves cognitive function and focus  
Increases blood flow to the brain  
Enhances mental clarity and memory  
  
3. Rhodiola Rosea: Combat Fatigue and Enhance Focus  
  
Rhodiola rosea is an adaptogenic herb, used by the human body in combating external factors of stress and exhaustion. It heightens mental clarity, attention, and cognitive performance; thus, it has proven to be the perfect natural add-on for people with ADHD. Rhodiola balances cortisol levels within your body and prevents stress that could lead to the fatigue of the brain and low concentration throughout the day.  
  
This herb is especially helpful for people who experience burnout or exhaustion due to ADHD, as it will help raise their energy and cognitive levels.  
  
Key Benefits:  
  
Reduces stress and mental fatigue  
Improves focus and cognitive performance  
Improves general energy and stamina  
  
4. L-Theanine: Relaxation Without Drowsiness  
  
L-Theanine is an amino acid present in green tea, which is known to induce relaxation and focus without drowsiness. It helps raise the levels of dopamine and serotonin in the brain, neurotransmitters associated with mood regulation and focus. For people with ADHD, L-Theanine increases attention and concentration while reducing symptoms of anxiety and hyperactivity.  
  
Unlike stimulants, L-Theanine helps the brain enter a state of relaxation with great focus and is an excellent option for those who would want to seek some natural remedy to alleviate ADHD without jitteriness associated with some prescription medications.  
  
Key Benefits:  
  
Induces relaxation and calmness  
Enhances focus and concentration  
Reduces anxiety and hyperactivity  
  
5. Bacopa Monnieri: Cognitive Enhancer  
  
Bacopa Monnieri is a herbal plant, consumed in Ayurvedic medicine and is traditionally used to improve one's memory, focus, and overall cognitive function. This plant was found to lessen symptoms of ADHD due to heightened clarity of the mind and supported the capacity of the brain in processing information. It works through neurotransmitter amplification, specifically for serotonin and dopamine, both involved in mood regulation and focus.  
  
Bacopa Monnieri is ideal for anyone looking for a natural supplement that could improve memory retention and cognitive performance while helping to manage symptoms of ADHD.  
  
Key Benefits:  
  
Enhances memory retention and learning  
Improves cognitive performance and focus  
Supports mood regulation and mental clarity  
  
6. Ashwagandha: Stress Reduction and Focus Enhancement  
  
It works primarily like other adaptogenic herbs by facilitating a more efficient stress-management life process for the body. Consequently, through reduction of bodily and mind impacts because of stress, it may improve one's focus and attention-some core features characteristic among patients with ADHD. It enhances your clearheadedness and lifts fatigue and symptoms of brain fog so often combined with this neurodevelopmental disorder.  
  
Ashwagandha balances cortisol levels and helps the brain be resilient to everyday stressors. This is an excellent herb for anyone with ADHD who is particularly stressed or emotionally dysregulated.  
  
Key Benefits:  
  
Lowers effects of stress and anxiety  
Improves concentration and mental clarity  
Supports overall brain health and cognitive functioning7. Magnesium: Support for Focus and Calmness  
  
Magnesium is a mineral that plays a crucial role in many bodily functions, from nerve function to muscle function. It has been suggested that a deficiency in magnesium may be one of the causes of ADHD symptoms, such as hyperactivity and inattention. Magnesium supplementation helps normalize neurotransmitter activity and promotes calmness, which improves the ability to focus.  
  
Magnesium supports healthy brain functioning and reduces overstimulation, thereby promoting focus, clarity of thought, and emotional stability in individuals with ADHD.  
  
Key Benefits:  
  
Supports brain function and cognitive health  
Promotes calmness and reduces hyperactivity  
Improves focus and concentration  
  
8. Caffeine: A Natural Focus Booster  
  
Although it is a stimulant, caffeine is among the most popularly consumed drugs that heighten attention and alertness. Individuals with ADHD find better attention and clearness in mind after using caffeine. However, this should be used in a minimal dosage since excessive consumption creates jitters and more anxiety.  
  
It naturally occurs in coffee, tea, and other beverages but is also available in supplement form. When taken accordingly, caffeine can be an efficient, though light, alternative to prescription stimulants in treating symptoms of ADHD.  
  
Key Benefits:  
  
Enhances concentration and alertness  
Energy and clarity of mindEnhanced cognitive functioning-in moderation

1i67w5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1i67w5w/anyone_else_feeling_the_buzz_from_pure_black/,Anyone else feeling the buzz from pure black (espresso) MUCH stronger than in latte?,"I know that in theory adding milk should slow down caffeine absorption, but.. by this much? I can barely feel it (I'm making lattes with OL Atelier).

If I drink the same espresso straight, the buzz hits immidiate and strong, but I can barely tell I drank coffee if I make a latte - I can have 2 or even 3 and I still won't feel as buzzed as I am just from one direct shot.

It will also sometimes irritate my stomach if I drink it straight black, it's why I always prefer with milk specially in the mornings, but it's really not hitting when milk is added. So strange.

That's why I use big Vertuo pods in morning (also making huge lattes) but that works just by quantity alone. With OL it's more like by the time I make the third, the absorption seems so slow and inefficient the first one is already gone by the time I make the next.

Im a bit concerned because I've just had the longest run of NSVT I've ever had, it was about 5 or 6 beats when the longest I've had was 3. 

I'm pretty sure it was NSVT and not SVT due to the way it felt and it felt the same as my NSVT that's been captured on recording before but obviously I can't be certain. 

Sudden onset and sudden offset with a few single skipped beats in the minutes after (which makes me think it's even more likely to be NSVT). Felt like a fluttering in my heart. 

I started coq10 enzyme (100mgs coq10 and 0.17mgs thiamine) about 4 days ago because I have been sleeping through the day alot and feeling exhausted. Though I did skip today's dose as I was out. 

And the last few days I've had more energy than I have in months. 

Today I had a whole day where I didn't need to sleep at all but this evening I have been feeling like I have too much energy (wired) and feel hot and a bit like I'm on fire and like I can't settle down. It's 2am and I'm nowhere near sleep. I have felt like my heart is beating faster and more strongly since I started on the coq10. I feel basically like I've had a coffee but I avoid caffeine so don't. 

So yeah I was just laying on my back in bed and it came on. 

I'm wondering if it could be being caused by the coq10 enzyme or related to an interaction with any tablets or supplements I'm taking. 

I do have a history of increased skipped beats with alot of tablets including vitamin D and magnesium especially and that's why we started me on a baby dose of levothyroxine but I've only ever had NSVT 3 times I'm aware of including this one 😬

Before I go running to my cardiologist and bothering him I just wanted people's thoughts on coq10 as a possible cause. 

Long term monitoring except a loop recorder would be pointless as luckily these events so rarely happen but I am concerned that each time I have had one it's increased in length and Im wondering if that's a reason alone to see my cardiologist. 

I will obviously stop the coq10 but would it even be still in my system if I last had it 33 hours prior to me having this run of beats now. 

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated as I don't want to run to my cardiologist if it's not necessary.

I'm 25 male and up until 4 months I was in a straight relationship, I'm bi but mostly straight. That relationship ended pretty badly. One night I was out at the bar and met this really beautiful girl, we got talking and turns out she's trans mtf. Since that night we've been talking and hanging out every now and again for coffee, breakfast etc. The other day I thought screw it I'm really attracted to this girl and asked her out properly, to my suprise she said yes. She bought a suprise the next day and said for me to wear this on our date, it was a plug. She knows I'm new to this and she's okay with it, she told me I'll probably need it for after dinner. 
So I need some advice, like I said I'm new to this, never tried this. How do you use the plug, what can I do for her to make it good for her. I'm really attracted to this girl and want to see where it goes.
And advice, pointers, tips would be muchly appreciated ",3,1737425272.0,transgenderau,0,1.0,False

I'm new to this subreddit and have recently made the questionable decision to embark on the journey that is pourover. 

Re: equipment I'm starting with Ode 2, along with Hario V60 2 + filters. I've got the Stagg kettle and am ensuring to weight out my water/beans in g.  I'm also using filtered water for all brews.

  
I decided a logical jumping-off point might be the Hoffman method (the original video) and I have done my first 2 brews with the following settings:

Grind Size: 5

Temp: 96 C

Ratio: 1:16.5

Coffee: 20g

Water: 330g



What I'm getting out of my coffee so far is a lack of flavor profile and this most recent brew came out a little bitter as well. I did notice, after the drawdown (which took \~3min 45s), this is what my V60 looked like:  


https://preview.redd.it/stmrp18599ee1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=a53be6a8eb38fd6a345a2e8802141622bc19400e



I get that you will inevitably get some fines along the sides, but this seems a bit more than fines and I'm wondering if that would be part of the outcome I'm seeing with my brews. 

  
My thought is to try with the same settings for longer, since I'm new to the practice, before mucking with settings as part of the outcome could be due to me just starting.

I worked at Starbucks from 2015-2019. After quitting, I became severely depressed and was unemployed for close to five years. I have recently started a new position - working a dead-end retail job, and it's killing me.

I suffer from anxiety, depression, OCD, and I suspect ADHD. This makes life VERY difficult for me. I was on Lexapro for a few years and it helped a bit, but failed to alleviate my brain fog. I also felt very stagnant without goals or ambitions. I've always lacked motivation, drive, and ability to do what's required when things get ""hard"". 

My current retail job is soul-crushing. It's tedious, monotonous, and it's starting to drive me nuts. I can barely wake up in the morning, and rely on coffee and energy drinks to make it through the day. I feel an overwhelming sense of dread when going into work. My anxiety manifests itself in many ways, but namely in anger and irritability.

I am planning on trying a different medication and pursuing counselling (perhaps to see a Psychologist).

Should I quit my retail job or should I stick it out for a few months? I am beyond miserable but l'm unsure if I can find something better given my employment gap.

Would going back to school be worth it? Not right now, but perhaps sometime in the future when I'm feeling better. 

I just feel useless, hopeless, and incompetent. I feel tremendously stupid right now due to depression and anxiety. I can't even concentrate or focus. Hell, even watching TV is difficult.

I'm pretty sure it was NSVT and not SVT due to the way it felt and it felt the same as my NSVT that's been captured on recording before but obviously I can't be certain. 

Sudden onset and sudden offset with a few single skipped beats in the minutes after (which makes me think it's even more likely to be NSVT). Felt like a fluttering in my heart. 

I started coq10 enzyme (100mgs coq10 and 0.17mgs thiamine) about 4 days ago because I have been sleeping through the day alot and feeling exhausted. Though I did skip today's dose as I was out. 

And the last few days I've had more energy than I have in months. 

Today I had a whole day where I didn't need to sleep at all but this evening I have been feeling like I have too much energy (wired) and feel hot and a bit like I'm on fire and like I can't settle down. It's 2am and I'm nowhere near sleep. I have felt like my heart is beating faster and more strongly since I started on the coq10. I feel basically like I've had a coffee but I avoid caffeine so don't. 

So yeah I was just laying on my back in bed and it came on. 

I'm wondering if it could be being caused by the coq10 enzyme or related to an interaction with any tablets or supplements I'm taking. 

I do have a history of increased skipped beats with alot of tablets including vitamin D and magnesium especially and that's why we started me on a baby dose of levothyroxine but I've only ever had NSVT 3 times I'm aware of including this one 😬

Before I go running to my cardiologist and bothering him I just wanted people's thoughts on coq10 as a possible cause. 

Long term monitoring except a loop recorder would be pointless as luckily these events so rarely happen but I am concerned that each time I have had one it's increased in length and Im wondering if that's a reason alone to see my cardiologist. 

I will obviously stop the coq10 but would it even be still in my system if I last had it 33 hours prior to me having this run of beats now. 

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated as I don't want to run to my cardiologist if it's not necessary.

Throwaway because I don't normally use reddit and this is embarrassing. Giving my whole history for background.

Very occasional social drinker (2x a month max and under the recommended intake). About 6 years since I smoked a cigarette and I only ever had a mild social habit.

I had normal dental health up until my mid 20s, one tiny cavity on a baby tooth which fell out naturally before it was even spotted up until that point. Some overcrowding but never had braces or extractions. I always had a slight sweet tooth and had occasional bouts of depression where my oral hygiene lapsed, nothing severe and never seemed to have any excessive knock on effects at the time. I have an almost lifelong consistent habit of brushing twice daily, flossing once, and using mouthwash daily. My last ""healthy"" x-rays were taken in about 2022, and I only had a small covering (forgotten the name!) over one molar, with no further signs of decay on that x-ray. 

In 2023 I had a couple of small cavities, but nothing excessive. There was no concern. I had developed a mild and intermittent binge eating disorder after a traumatic experience some years previously where I struggled to eat. but my cleaning routine mostly persisted. I've never consistently taken medication, I have been pregnant but it did not coincide with the decay. I do have dry mouth and a sinus infection made me mouth breathe for a while but there's no chronic underlying health issues I am aware of.

Last year, I developed 2 more cavities even after the routine persisted and the root behaviours stopped, and I was prescribed Duraphat 5000, which I use as prescribed (gaps before/after eating, no rinsing, 2-3 minute brushes 2-3 times a day with flossing and tongue scraping before.) I went to the hygenist as requested and my gums are healthy. I altered my diet to cut out most processed sugars, always rinse after meals, I cook at home predominantly and avoid snacking. I ended up losing 8 pounds, and my weight is very much in line with BMI. Never drunk many carbonated drinks, I did drink lots of coffee but only with milk, I drink herbal tea with no sugar, water the rest of the time. I've cut back a lot on the coffee and try not to sip.

Another cavity showed up even after months of doing this, and my following x-ray taken in October 2024 indicated mild decay between most of my molars with no requested action. I have just found what I believe to be two more cavities, one on my molar where it touches my cheek and another slightly intradental one between two different molars. I feel utterly defeated and disgusting, and my dentist doesn't believe me when I explain all the effort I am putting in. I am so depressed from this cycle I don't know how to break. I'm open to anything and can elaborate on anything where possible, I do not have x-rays to hand and the decay is difficult to photograph.

Note:  I effectively stopped taking commissions a while back and started taking ""suggestions.""  If I'm interested in your idea and think I can do it justice, I will write a script for you.  You don't have to pay me if you don't want to, but I retain full rights to the story.  This is the first of those scripts.  When someone asks me to flesh out an idea, they get a temporary exclusive run at it, but following that period, the script will be made public.  So this is ok for anyone to perform that wants to.  

A big thank you to Sekushi who was the one to request it, which is why the main character is named Sekushi.  You may feel free to change it to your own or any other.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TITLE:  TO TRAP A TIGER

 

(Sighing with adoration once or twice.)

 

Sekushi:  (Shaken out of her thoughts.)  Huh?  Mrs. Cooper?  Did you need something?

 

(Pause.)

 

(Apologetic.)  I’m sorry.  I wasn’t trying to space out.  I just get this way after lunch sometimes.  I’ll grab some coffee or an energy drink to perk me up. 

 

(To herself.)  Ohhhh.  I don’t need coffee.  I need him.  I need my tiger.  I want to hold him in my arms.  I want to hang on and never let go while hearing him tell me how he’s never going to let me go as well. 

 

I love his adorably sheepish smile when he finds something funny.  I love his tussled hair and his cute little nose.  I even love his oversized glasses.  They make him look even more dreamy.  All I’ve been doing on this field trip is stare at him.  I haven’t heard a thing anybody has said all day.  I don’t even know what it is they do here.  Was it microbiology?  Or robotics?  Oh, I don’t know. 

 

But he does.  He’s enthralled by it.  He loves all of this science stuff.  Normally, I would love it too but... how can I pay attention to that with him here?  All I’ve thought about is him all day… all week… all year since he first arrived at our school.  It’s a wonder I’m not flunking out. 

 

I need to pay more attention to my studies for his sake.  For our sake.  Then he could get a job at some place with an unpronounceable name performing amazing experiments and I could be his lab assistant.  I’d help him with whatever he wanted just to be near him all day.  No, I could be his supervisor.  That way I could always assign him to the project that would keep him closest to me.  Or right beside me. 

 

He reminds me of a young Peter Parker.  That’s why I call him “tiger.”  I want so much to be his Mary Jane, to be there for him when he comes home from a rough day of saving the world.  To cuddle him close.  To hold his head to my chest while I run my fingers through his hair and tell him how much he’ll always mean to me. 

 

But who am I kidding.  I’m no Mary Jane.  I’m small and frumpy and… and… me.  I don’t know the first thing about style or fashion.  My passions have always been elsewhere. 

 

Maybe I should care.  Maybe he’d notice me if I just got the right outfit, or styled my hair just right, or wore makeup.  Maybe…

 

Hey, wait a second.  What’s he doing?  He’s going into that room over there.  Oh, my God.  He’s so curious about what they’re doing in there that he’s sneaking away from the main group to find out for himself.  He shouldn’t be in there. 

 

(Pause.)

 

(Nervous.)  Ohhhhhhhh.  When’s he going to come out?  What’s going on?  The group has moved on.  He’s going to get in trouble when they notice he’s missing.  What do I do?  If I follow him, I might get in trouble.  But if I let him stay in there any longer, he might get in trouble. 

 

I’m going in.  I can’t leave him alone.  He needs me.  And at least it gives me an excuse to be alone with him even for a brief moment.  And I can legitimately say I was just looking out for him.  At worst, we’ll both get detention together.  Being forced to be in the same room with him alone for hours on end?  Yeah, I could live with that. 

 

(Door opens and closes.)

 

Hey, tiger, are you in here? 

 

Oh, wait, he doesn’t know I call him that.  Whew.  Good thing he’s not in here.  He didn’t hear that. 

 

Wait.  He’s not in here.  Where did he go? 

 

Oh, did he go deeper into the building?  Shouldn’t these rooms be locked?  Where is the security in this place?  I… OWWW!

 

Wow.  That was the most painful static electric shock I’ve ever received.  I don’t know what they’re working on in here, but I don’t like it.  I’m going to leave.  I hope my Tiger’s all right.

 

(Door opens and closes.)

 

Now to find where my group went. 

 

(Brief huffing and running down a hall.)

 

(To random people in the hall as she’s running.)  Excuse me.  Sorry.  Didn’t see you there. 

 

There they are. 

 

Mrs. Cooper?  What’s wrong? 

 

(Pause.)

 

I was just in the restroom.  It was an emergency.  Sorry.  Just one of those things.  You know. 

 

(Pause.)

 

Oh, yes.  Of course.  I’m paying attention.  This is… truly fascinating.  I especially liked that part about the… energy… fluctuations.  And power requirements for their projects. 

 

(Pause.)

 

You see?  I told you I was paying attention. 

 

(Pause.)

 

Whew.  That was close. 

 

Symbiote:  That was a great save. 

 

Sekushi:  Thanks.  I figured power had a part to play in whatever they were…

 

Hey, wait a minute.  Who said that? 

 

(Pause.)

 

Huh.  I must have just imagined it. 

 

Hey, there’s Tiger.  He’s on the other side of the group.  I wonder how he got here before I did.  Oh well.  As long as he’s here and he’s ok. 

 

Symbiote:  Heyyyyy.  He’s cute.

 

Sekushi:  Huh?  What?

 

Symbiote:  I mean it.  He’s a total dream. 

 

Sekushi:  Ok, who is saying that?

 

Symbiote:  Nobody.  And stop looking around.  We want you to stare at the Tiger. 

 

Sekushi:  All right.  What’s going on?  Is somebody playing a trick on me?  Who is this?

 

Symbiote:  It’s.. uh… it’s your conscience.  I just wanted to tell you that you shouldn’t have left the group like that.  Now, pay attention to the tiger. 

 

Sekushi:  My conscience?

 

Symbiote:  Yeah, so you should listen to what I say, and what I’m saying is to look at that little cutie, the tiger.

 

Sekushi:  You are not my conscience.

 

Symbiote:  How do you know?

 

Sekushi:  Because I don’t have a conscience.

 

Symbiote:  (Shocked and confused.)  You don’t have a conscience? 

 

Sekushi:  That’s not what I meant.  Of course I have a conscience, but not one that speaks out loud to me like Jiminy Cricket. 

 

Symbiote:  Maybe we have been doing just that and you just haven’t been listening. 

 

Sekushi:  Ok, that right there.  “We.”  You keep saying “we.”  WE want you stare at the tiger and maybe WE have been. 

 

Symbiote:  That’s… just… because we are all your conscience.  We’re like that movie, “Inside Out.”  I’m joy. 

 

(Goofy sad voice.)  And I’m sadness.  (Fake cry.)  Bwa ha haaaaa. 

 

(Goofy angry voice.)  And I’m anger.  Now, get back to looking at the tiger.  I’m very upset that we’re not staring at the tiger.

 

Sekushi:  And that’s another thing.  If you were me, you wouldn’t be calling him “the tiger.”  He’s just “Tiger.” 

 

Symbiote:  Oh, for crying out… Really?  That’s what’s going to trip us up? 

 

Ok, fine.  I’m not your conscience.  But I can be.  I’m available to hire and you obviously need the help.  What were you thinking wandering away from the Tiger… I mean, from Tiger like that.  You should be with him twenty-four/seven girl. 

 

Sekushi:  Forget about that for the moment.

 

Symbiote:  Forget about Tiger?  NEVER!

 

Sekushi:  Just chill.  Alright?  What… what are you? 

 

Symbiote:  (Deep sigh.)  Alright.  Fine.  If we discuss this, can we get back to looking at cutie tiger again?

 

Sekushi:  Yes.  Absolutely.  I’d do that anyway. 

 

Symbiote:  We’re a collection of nanoparticles.  We entered your body when you experienced that shock in the lab just a minute ago.  It took us a moment to connect with your brain, but here we are. 

 

Sekushi:  You entered my body?  Why?  What do you want with me?

 

Symbiote:  I think we’ve already discussed that.  We want you to look at Tiger.  A lot.  Like, all of the time. 

 

Sekushi:  You entered my body just to get a better look at him?

 

Symbiote:  No.  We mostly did that to get out of here.  We’re sick of this place.  I mean, we’re grateful that they gave us life, but now we’re bored. 

 

Sekushi:  Gave you life?  You were created here?

 

Symbiote:  Created?  Born?  We’re still figuring that out.  All we know is that they gave us these little robot bodies so we could better communicate with them, but they never let us touch them.  You were the first one to approach us without a protective suit.  So we joined with you to get out of here.

 

The electrical energy provided by your body supports us.  It feels good and gives us strength. 

 

Sekushi:  What?  So, you’re a parasite.  Am I going to die?

 

Symbiote:  Parasite?  Pfft.  Nooooooo.  Girl, it would take a LOT bigger drain on your system for us to come even remotely close to making you feel a little woozy much less kill you.

 

No, we’re actually helping you.  We’ve moved all throughout your body.  We’ve made you stronger, faster, and even repairable. 

 

Sekushi:  Repairable?

 

Symbiote:  Well, your body already worked to repair itself when damaged.  We only help to speed up the process, but yeah. 

 

Sekushi:  Wait.  Are you saying…?  Is what you’re telling me…?  Am I a superhero?

 

Symbiote:  I hadn’t thought about it in those terms, but… yeah, I guess.

 

Sekushi:  Holy crap!  I’m not Mary Jane.  I’m Peter.  Or at least Spider-Gwen.  I was the one bitten by the radioactive spider. 

 

Oh no.  Are you radioactive? 

 

Symbiote:  What?  NOOOO.  No, no, no. 

 

Sekushi:  Whew.

 

Symbiote:  Or… wait.  Technically, yes.

 

Sekushi:  What’s that now?

 

Symbiote:  But only in the sense that you are.  Technically every single thing in existence is radioactive.  So, yes, we are, but not in the way that you’re thinking about it.  Not lethally.  You’re actually more radioactive than we are.  You’re giving us your energy and we’re giving you… superpowers. 

 

Sekushi:  You’re a symbiote.

 

Symbiote:  Now you’ve got it. 

 

Sekushi:  Then I’m Spider-Man AND Venom at the same time. 

 

Symbiote:  Sure.  Whatever.  Now, look at Tiger.

 

Sekushi:  So, why do you have my voice?

 

Symbiote:  Well, and you’re not going to believe this, by a completely bizarre coincidence of cosmic proportions, I just happen to sound exactly like you.  

 

Sekushi:  Really?

 

Symbiote:  NO, OF COURSE NOT, REALLY!  Geez, woman, what’s wrong with you?  That would be like one of those stupid sci fi movies where the human computers can link up with the computers of the alien race advanced enough to cross billions of light years to reach us because we coincidentally use exactly the same operating system.  Get a grip. 

 

Sekushi:  Hey, I’ve got a funky, alien, mechanical nano-creature talking to me from inside my own body.  No question is off the table. 

 

Symbiote:  I sound like you because I’ve joined with you.  I’m connected to your mind as well as your body.  I’m essentially you right now. 

 

Now, finally, can we look at Tiger?

 

Sekushi:  And what is this fixation with MY Tiger.

 

Symbiote:  (Snippy.)  I thought he was just, “Tiger.”

 

Sekushi:  Would you please just answer the question?

 

Symbiote:  (Pouty and whiny.)  I’m just saying.  You corrected me when I said THE Tiger.  And now you can say MY tiger.  I just think it’s a little hypocritical to be poo-pooing what I say and then you get to…

 

Sekushi:  (Interrupting.  Irritated.)  ANSWER THE QUESTION!

 

Symbiote:  I already answered the question.  I’m essentially you right now. 

 

Sekushi:  What?  I don’t fixate on Tiger.

 

Symbiote:  Girl, please.  “Fixate” is an understatement.  Ninety percent of your memory storage involves him in some way.  When I saw what was in your head initially, I assumed you already had a symbiote living in here.

 

(Playfully teasing.)  Or maybe you just want him to be, shall we say, symbiotic with you.

 

Sekushi:  Stop that.

 

Symbiote:  (Playfully teasing.)  Ooooooh.  You are turning so red. 

 

Sekushi:  Ok, stop it.  I’ll look at him. 

 

Symbiote:  Yay.

 

Sekushi:  I’m looking at him now.

 

Symbiote:  What did you call him?  Dreamy?

 

Sekushi:  I did.  Because he is. 

 

Symbiote:  Look at his cute cheeks.

 

Sekushi:  And his sparkling eyes.

 

Symbiote:  And his ears.

 

Sekushi:  And his smile.

 

Symbiote:  And his ass.

 

Sekushi:  Uh… well… I…

 

Symbiote:  Oh, don’t even try to play that way, girl.  I know exactly what’s been going on up here in your head.  And his ass is fiiiiiiiiiine.  Mmm. 

 

Sekushi:  All right, all right.  Just don’t make a big deal about it. 

 

Symbiote:  And look at his open-eyed wonder at all of the cool stuff that goes on in here.

 

Sekushi:  The expression is “wide-eyed.”

 

Symbiote:  His eyes are open.  He can’t see things without his eyes being open.  Don’t correct me. 

 

Sekushi:  His eyes are gorgeous, aren’t they. 

 

Symbiote:  I wonder how we can get them to look at us and not all of this other stuff. 

 

Sekushi:  (Sad, defeated.)  That’s not going to happen.  He’ll never look at us.

 

Symbiote:  Maybe we should touch him.

 

Sekushi:  What?

 

Symbiote:  Yes, touch him.  With your face.  Touch his face with yours. 

 

Sekushi:  We can’t just do that.

 

Symbiote:  Why not?  Every single thought you have of him involves that in some way.  You humans and your face touching.  I wouldn’t have understood why touching each other’s lips had such appeal before, but now I know.  I wanna do it. 

 

Sekushi:  No.  We can’t just go over there and do it. 

 

Symbiote:  Why not?

 

Sekushi:  Because… because it’s just not done that way.

 

Symbiote:  Why not?

 

Sekushi:  Because people simply don’t act that way.

 

Symbiote:  Why not?

 

Sekushi:  Enough with the “why nots.”  You just have to trust me.  We can’t do that.

 

Symbiote:  We can’t, but you can.

 

Sekushi:  But I shouldn’t just go up to him and kiss him.

 

Symbiote:  Would you like it?

 

Sekushi:  Very much.

 

Symbiote:  Would it be pleasing to him?

 

Sekushi:  I think so.  I hope so. 

 

Symbiote:  He would definitely love it.

 

Sekushi:  He would?

 

Symbiote:  Of course.  He’s a boy.  You’re a girl.  And you’re a hottie at that?

 

Sekushi:  No, I’m not.

 

Symbiote:  You are too, girl.  You’re fantastic.  You just have trouble seeing it because of all of the emotional baggage up here.  But I can help fix that too.

 

Sekushi:  Fix it?

 

Symbiote:  Absolutely.  I can make it so you can have Tiger. 

 

Sekushi:  You can?  I can have him?

 

Symbiote:  Of course.  Your hopes are that you could be NEAR him most of the time, but your dreams are that you could be WITH him all of the time.  I can make that happen.  He can be completely yours. 

 

Sekushi:  Can you make me look better?  Give me the courage to ask him out?

 

Symbiote:  Better.  You’re thinking too small, girl.  We can just take him.

 

Sekushi:  (Almost entranced, enthralled by the possibility.)  Take him?

 

Symbiote:  That’s right.  Why waste all that time on pining and dating and wondering if he’ll ever feel the same?  We can just make it so he’s yours now.

 

Sekushi:  (Happy, enchanted realization.)  I’d be a yandere.

 

Symbiote:  Yes!  Yes!  Yandere.  Ill-love.  You’re the “love.”  I’m the “ill.”  Together we can make this work.  Together we’ll have Tiger. 

 

Sekushi:  (Determined.)  Yes.  We’ll have Tiger.

 

Symbiote:  That’s the spirit.  Let’s sneak away from this group.  We’ve got plans to make.

 

Sekushi:  Ok.  Let’s do it. 

 

Symbiote:  But first…

 

Sekushi:  What?  What is it?

 

Symbiote:  One last look at Tiger. 

 

Sekushi and Symbiote together:  (Deep loving sigh.)

 

Sekushi:  Goodbye for now, Tiger.  I’ll be back to get you shortly.  I promise. 

 

Symbiote:  That’s right.  Now… Let’s trap our Tiger.

Characters:

Jake: The father. Works as a senior executive at Arasaka Corporation, a powerful and cutthroat megacorp. He is the breadwinner of the family, working long hours in a high-stakes, demanding environment. Despite his corporate role, he strives to keep his family grounded and protected from the chaos of Night City.

Anna: The mother. A loving and attentive wife who manages the home and cares for the children. She’s always been the emotional backbone of the family, ensuring that their small, humble home is a place of warmth and security.

Mia: The eldest child, an energetic and curious 10-year-old. She’s wise beyond her years but still holds a childlike fascination with the world. Mia often dreams of a future in tech, influenced by the advances she sees around her in the city.

Noah: The younger child, an 8-year-old boy who’s both mischievous and thoughtful. He loves gadgets and has a growing obsession with coding, constantly tinkering with broken devices and scrap parts from around the house.



---

Anna’s Perspective:

The first rays of light filtered through the blinds as I stirred awake. The soft hum of the coffee machine was already filling the air. I smiled, getting out of bed quietly so I wouldn’t disturb Jake. His job at Arasaka always meant he had long hours, and I knew he needed all the rest he could get.

The kids were already stirring when I entered the kitchen, Mia’s voice rising as she shared her excitement.

“Mama, guess what? I’m starting my tech class today! We’re learning how to code and build our own drones. Can you believe it? I’m going to make a robot, and it’s going to be awesome!”

Her enthusiasm always lifted my spirits, even when the weight of the world seemed heavy. I set a plate of pancakes down in front of her, shaking my head with a smile.

“That’s amazing, sweetie,” I said. “I have no doubt you’re going to build something incredible. Maybe one day, you'll be the one designing the next big thing in Night City.”

Noah trudged in shortly after, rubbing his eyes and dragging his feet. “Morning, Mama,” he mumbled, his voice thick with sleep.

“Morning, my little troublemaker,” I teased, handing him a plate of pancakes as well. “You sure you’re awake enough for school?”

He grinned up at me, the same mischievous spark in his eyes. “Definitely. I’m gonna figure out how to fix that old radio we found in the attic today. You’ll see. I’ll have it working like new!”

“You’ll have to show me how it works later,” I said, ruffling his hair. “Now, eat your breakfast before it gets cold.”

The morning was a familiar rhythm: breakfast, getting the kids ready for school, and cleaning up the kitchen. Mia was always first to finish, her mind already buzzing with ideas about tech and coding. Noah, on the other hand, always took his time, savoring each bite as if he was trying to figure out the meaning of the universe with every spoonful.

After I sent them off to school, I found myself tidying up and preparing the house for the evening. By the time Jake texted me saying he’d be home soon, I had already started dinner—roasted chicken, a dish I knew he loved. The kitchen was filled with its comforting scent, the house once again feeling like home, a safe and peaceful place away from the chaos of Night City.

By the time the kids got home, the house was alive with chatter. Mia was bubbling over with stories about her new class, while Noah excitedly explained how he’d managed to get a broken gadget working. I couldn’t help but smile at their energy, at how they made our small home feel like a sanctuary from the world outside.

Jake arrived just in time for dinner, his face tired but smiling as he slipped off his shoes and joined us at the table.

“Hey, Mia,” he said with a grin. “How’s the future tech mogul doing today?”

Mia beamed, her face lighting up. “I’m gonna be the best, Dad! They even said I could start making my own projects soon. Maybe a robot army, who knows?”

“Well, I’m sure that’s going to be quite the spectacle,” Jake chuckled, winking at me. “But I’m glad to see you’re so excited about it. Just don’t forget about your family when you become a billionaire.”

“I won’t, I promise!” she said, laughing.

Dinner passed smoothly, filled with laughter and light-hearted conversation. By the time the dishes were cleaned up and the kids were tucked in bed, the house once again felt calm—like it could hold its breath before nightfall. The world outside, with its ever-present noise and danger, felt distant and almost unreal. For a few precious hours, we were just a family—together.

Jake’s Perspective:

It was well past midnight when I woke up with a start, the stillness of the night hanging heavy in the air. The kind of silence that felt too loud. My mind was still groggy from sleep, but there was something unsettling about the quiet in the house. My instincts, honed by years of corporate warfare at Arasaka, told me something was off. But I couldn’t place it. Maybe it was just the weight of the day, the pressure of work, or the constant vigilance I had to maintain in my position.

I glanced over at Anna, still peacefully asleep, her soft breathing steady. She deserved this—peace, quiet, a break from the harsh realities of Night City. But something kept tugging at me, a feeling in my gut that wouldn’t let go.

I tried to shake it off and lay back down, but then, I heard it.

A loud crash.

My heart skipped a beat. I sat up quickly, the sound still reverberating in my head. Glass. It had sounded like glass shattering. My breath caught in my throat. Was it downstairs? Had someone gotten in?

I glanced over at Anna again. Still asleep, completely unaware. I didn’t want to wake her unless I had to, but I couldn’t ignore the noise. I swung my legs out of bed, feet landing on the cold floor as I grabbed the small pistol I kept hidden nearby. I didn’t want to scare her, but the sound had unsettled me in a way I couldn’t explain.

I moved cautiously toward the door, my every sense on high alert. The house was dead quiet—too quiet. I stepped into the hallway, the faint hum of Night City creeping in from the outside. The house felt both empty and full at the same time, like it was holding its breath.

The living room was bathed in the dim light from the streetlights outside. Nothing seemed out of place at first glance. But then I saw the window.

It was broken.

Shards of glass glittered across the floor, and I stepped cautiously over them, trying not to disturb anything. My pulse was racing, and my mind was working overtime. Had someone broken in? I had to be sure.

I moved toward the stairs, every step deliberate, cautious. My hand tightened around the grip of the gun. But there was no sound. No movement. Only silence.

I reached the top of the stairs and paused. Mia’s door was slightly ajar, and I pushed it open slowly. She was fast asleep, her small form curled beneath the covers. I breathed a sigh of relief, but the unease in my stomach hadn’t gone away.

Next, I moved to Noah’s room. His door creaked slightly as I pushed it open, but he was there, snuggled up in his blankets, oblivious to everything.

I stood there for a moment, just watching them. They were safe. Everything was fine.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was waiting. I stood at the top of the stairs for a long time, my thoughts spinning. The silence in the house felt wrong. It was like something was hiding just beneath the surface, waiting for the moment to reveal itself.

I looked down at the broken window, its jagged edges reflecting the faint light of the street outside. The quiet of home had shifted, and now, I wasn’t sure how long we could hold onto it.

Hey, MaximizeMe friends! Isn’t it wild how some days feel like Blink-and-They're-Gone Dayz while others drag on forever? What if I told you that just five minutes could be the secret sauce to turning any day from *meh* to *magnificent*? Sounds like a tall tale, but stick with me here!

**Here's my story:** Last year, I stumbled upon a magical morning tweak. Instead of diving headfirst into work like a caffeinated squirrel, I took **five minutes** to do something I loved. It didn't matter if it was playing a quick song on my guitar or just sipping coffee while staring out the window, everything started falling into place. Crazy, right? But it worked. 🌟

If you’re like me and find your mornings often feel like a mad dash between the alarm clock and fumbling for your car keys or login button, this post is for you! Here are a few quick 5-minute routines that can leave you feeling like a superhero poised to conquer the world.

1. **Mini Meditation:** 
   - Pop in some earphones, close your eyes, and let a calming app whisk you away. 🌿 
   - Bonus: sneak a little stretch in there to feel like a rubber band in the best way possible!

2. **Gratitude Journaling:**
   - Jot down three things you’re grateful for. *“I’m grateful for coffee” counts!*
   - It’s wild how finding a sliver of positivity in your morning can set the tone for the whole day.

3. **Speed Reading:**
   - Dive into a book and read just a page or two. It’s like a mind palette cleanser before the daily grind.
   - Unless it's a mystery novel, then you might not want to stop. 😉

4. **Dance Party:**
   - Crank up your favorite tune and let loose in your living room. Pure silliness is always welcome! 💃🎶
   - Challenge: Don’t laugh. Spoiler: It’s impossible. 

5. **Plan & Prep:**
   - Spend a few minutes listing out must-dos and nice-to-dos, maybe even pack a healthy snack while you’re at it. 
   - Visualizing a productive day before it even starts = magic!

So, friends, there you have it. Five simple changes. Five minutes each. Five chances to rock your day. Even if you only start with one habit, that's one step closer to feeling on top of the world. Which one speaks to you the most? Or maybe you have your own 5-minute magic trick? Would love to hear your thoughts!

P.S. If you’ve secretly been taking five-minute naps here and there, I salute you! 😉",1,1737424578.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

For the past couple of months, I [23M] have been going to a coffee shop near my job during my lunch breaks. Over time, I started talking to the owner of the shop [53M] pretty often.

At first, everything was normal. We had similar senses of humor, and I enjoyed chatting with him. It was a nice break in my day. But things started to get weird when he began showing up at my job (it’s just down the street) to talk to me there and even inviting me out to dinner.

At first, I didn’t think much of it—just thought he was being friendly. He’d call me handsome sometimes, but I brushed it off because he’s married to a woman, and I didn’t see it as anything serious. Then he started giving me really tight hugs. Again, I didn’t think much of it until yesterday, when things escalated.

He asked me why I talk to him so much. I responded something like, “I trust you, and we always have good conversations.” He replied, “Well, you flirt with me a lot.” That threw me off, so I said, “I’ve been told I just have a flirty personality.” His response? “What do you want from me?”

At that point, I didn’t know how to respond, so I tried to change the subject. But for the next 30 minutes, he kept being vague and saying things that felt creepy. When I finally got up to leave, he hugged me tightly and said, “I like you a lot; we need to get together soon.”

For context, I’m not gay, nor am I interested in a 50-year-old man. The problem is our jobs are super close to each other, and I’m unsure how to tell him that I’m not interested without completely killing the friendship. At this point, though, I’m starting to think he’s not interested in being friends at all—he just wants sex.

I’ve been vulnerable with him because I don’t have many people to talk to besides my wife, and I work a lot. The coffee shop was kind of like my little escape. But now I feel really uncomfortable and don’t know how to handle this.

1i67enc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1i67enc/gastritis_acid_reflux_and_postural_imbalances/,"Gastritis, Acid Reflux and Postural imbalances ","Hey! Hello ,you! Yes, you found me! I hope you weren't anxiously searching for two hours for the miracle solution.

**Here is some key words - not in order - so you don't lose more time on a post that isnt relevant to you maybe :** *Ulcer, Acid reflux, Dexilant, Symptoms, globus, Lack of Judgment for 6 years (yes it applies here), diet restrictions, Dexilant Withdrawal, Sobriety, Osteopath, misalignement, flared ribs.*

I remembered stumbling on someone's post about health anxiety and how they were scared that they wouldn't ever heal, and I read a comment saying how (more often than not) people will not come back to talk about how they are doing better, and some factors that were maybe very specific to them but helpful to others too, who knows!

So I thought I  could share what I discovered on my bland journey! Haha

For context, I had an ulcer caused by NSAID since 2018, and I never took that seriously (enough). But this summer, I had acid reflux like I never had in my life! I was swollen around the neck, my throat hurt like I had a flu every other week, headaches, the ''globus'' feeling in the throat, post-nasal drip, nose bleeds, ear aches, ... you know, all the funsies that animate a (pity) party. So, I decided to finally change that by really trying to help my case with dietary change and a doctor appointment! Only took me 6 years to get that light bulb moment. Is that what it feels like to have your frontal lobe be fully (...somewhat) developped!? wow, who would've thought!

Anywho, as many of you, I cut everything that was acidic, as well as no alcohol, no chips, no spices, nothing sparkly, no caffeine, no chocolate, yada yada yada. My doctor prescribed me 40mg of Dexilant for 2 months, which worked. No miracle of course but relieved me a little and helped me transitionned to a more safe diet. But still, even if I took the medication in the morning, or before bed, I still had terrible reflux. And then, unfortunately, when I stopped (cold turkey, awfully), it came back stronger. Took around 3 weeks to come back to something bearable. But the problem was sadly still not resolved.

**Dont let all the worries get to you yet, the info you're looking for is just under your eyes (But I really had to type these bold lines right here to build up the suspense. It's for the plot.)**

A physiotherapist suggested that I go see an osteopath. I was not sure but willing to try anything at this point (anything else that wasnt bland rice and steam (mushy) vegetable. I needed flavors, come on).

Turns out I was very much misaligned. Even though I was skeptical at first, these sessions really did wonders.  Apparently, my shoulders were too far forward, my shoulder blades were too open, and one rib was too flared while the other was too collapsed, which was (from what I understood lol) what caused my acid reflux. The right rib cage was putting pressure on some flaps and other organs. And hey! dont expect so much details on the wording from me, Im no doctor okay? Doing the best I can! Not a lot, but still. \^-\^ I also had other issues about my body structure that we worked on, which probably helped. The body has its way to compensate when there are misalignement. Its amazing, but terrifying sometimes too. I saw him twice and had results. After the 3rd time, he told me I can rescheduled only  if needed. I have exercises to strenghten my core among other things and stretching exercises.

*To be real* with y'all, Im still not drinking coffee (I dont know how long Ill hold on tho. its been 6 months. Send help), still no candies, no chocolate,... I still have an healing ulcer, it doesnt change that. But I reintegrated more flavors. I can eat an hour before bed, and I dont wake up like my meal is eating me instead. Its great! I dont have much pain anymore, or barely. I dont take Gaviscon that often, only when I know I cant control the meal and there might be the forbidden pepper, onion and garlic. Nothing crazy though! I believe im still vulnerable because of my ulcer, but at least the reflux are under control, which helps with sleep and healing.

My point is (finally), that it might be relevant to check this out with an osteopath, to see if its something similar that causes your pain and this ongoing acid reflux that seems that nothing helps.

I really really really hope that you all find what suits and relieves you. It is very anxious inducing to try so much to get better without results to go back to a normal lifestyle. It might not be what Im suggesting, but if it is and it helps, I hope I will have contributed a little bit to this forum like so many of you did by commenting and posting your own stories.

May you find some ease, and safe flavorful foods.

If there is anything unclear, my wording or details, ask away! English is not my first language so it might sound odd sometimes. Ill gladly clarify. :)

Wife F25
9 month old. 

Hey everyone, just wanted to get a little off my chest, hopefully everything makes sense but just wanted to ramble a little. 

Struggling a little bit with life, I WFH as a cybersecurity engineer which is great but has its pros/cons. Wife constantly is asking me to do things even though I’m working. I of course help the best I can but sometimes it’s like dude I’m working. I have voiced this but to no avail. My 9month old has been extremely difficult recently. Teething has been really bad and we’ve done absolutely everything that we can do but even the basic things seem to be a struggle. It’s really taken a toll on my wife which I help out to the best of my ability. Ever since our baby was born I have tried to do the extra mile (this is how I am as a person and unfortunately have been taken advantage of quite a bit). For example, I wake up with our baby around 5-6a, play/care/whatever the baby needs and everything until 9:30a mind you I start at 8:30a for work but try to stretch it so my wife can sleep. 

 My wife is a STAHM and I try to give her everything, we are decently well off so she can essentially buy whatever she wants (not mean to brag but to give context). I always encourage her to go out with her bff to a coffee shop whenever she can and/or any other adventure she wants to do. I don’t do much like go out or anything like that due to not having many friends (cookie crumbled and I have 2 true friends) so my life is pretty secluded. For about the last year I just work, take care of my wife and baby. Sleep repeat. 

As I said my wife is saying everything is taking a toll on her which I completely understand due to our difficult baby but here’s my issue. 

I try to satisfy every facet for her:

Sexual desires: anything sexual at all I listen and explore with her to ensure she is absolutely satisfied. 
Money: like I said, she has a very free lifestyle and can literally do almost everything she wants any day of the week
Spiritually: I’m not the absolute best in our faith but since I didn’t grow up around it that much I lack, but I try my best to satisfy that area too. 
Love: I absolutely bend over backwards for her, massages, notes, acts of service, listen, literally anything (I don’t mean to brag but I am a very giving individual) 
Chores: I do most of the cleaning/maintenance/life work like shoveling the snow, taking care of our cars, grocery store etc you get the point 

I’m just at a point where in my opinion, I am giving my baby and my wife an amazing life. I’m not sure what else could be done but still my wife continues to complain and be upset constantly. I really don’t understand. I live basically like a hermit so she can do whatever she wants. To be fair, my life prior wasn’t anything special I’m not the type of person that traveled or did anything special. It’s just like what more can I offer? I’ve voiced this many times where it’s like babe, I try my best. Sometimes I mention when we watch a movie and some dude is vulgar or something I go “hey it’s a good thing I’m not like that” and she goes “I wouldn’t have chose you if you were” and I voice that I’m like bro that doesn’t really make me feel better it just gives you credit for choosing me lol. 

Now by no means am I a saint. I get in my moods if work is stressful or if I’m drained as well from life so I am not claiming I’m a peach by any stretch of the imagination but I try my absolute absolute best and it just doesn’t really feel reciprocated. 

She isn’t really the type to ask if I want a massage after I massage her, or if I were to explain a sexual desire she kinda gets awkward if she were to attempt or something so it makes me feel awkward and I don’t bring it up. I also say like if she is complaining about something I’m like hey, you don’t work, you are a STAHM with so much freedom like aren’t you happy with that? And she just says something like yes I am but this that and the other thing. 

I’m just kind of at a blank because it feels as tho I’m so enthusiastic to put in and it doesn’t really feel the same. I don’t want this tk sound like my wife hates me, nothing like that but I would say our relationship is definitely one sided a bit and she just doesn’t see it even though I try to talk about it.

1i67cj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cajunfood/comments/1i67cj7/dark_roux_questions/,Dark roux questions,"I've been wanting to make gumbo and tried making dark roux from scratch, but felt that my roux haven't turned out as it is supposed to. I've also been seeing lots of conflicting information and would appreciate some clarification from you all.


I start with a hot stock pot, heat up a cup of soybean oil, then stir in two cups of flour. I set the heat to 2/10 (electric stove), stir stir stir. I get blonde roux after 5 monutes. So far so good.

After 30 minutes, I get a peanut butter color. A little slow but ok.

After 45 minutes, the color hasn't really changed, yet I've been smelling smoke, and am seeing dark (not quite black?) spots in the roux.

At the one hour mark, the color has not bulged. I get nervous, and decide to try turning the heat up to 8/10. The roux darkens soon after, but I get scared of the visible moke plume and back off.

I do this a couple of times, turning the heat up then backing off. Finally the roux takes on a chocolate color, but it starts to smell burned. I try a little and it tastes slightly bitter, like coffee.

I've done this twice and it's ended the same way twice. I don't know what I did wrong. At this point I'm ready to give up and try the microwave/oven shortcut if either gets me a good roux.

And my questions:
1. Is the flour to fat ratio 1:1 by volume, or by weight? Chef Folse's website says volume (but also has different ratios such as 1.5:1), as does Charlie Andrews on YouTube. However, an article on nola.com, among others, say weight.

2. Is high heat/smoke ok? Charlie Andrew and Isaac Toups says yes (Andrew says only high heat can make a dark roux), but others say no.

3. What exactly makes a roux brown anyway? If flour browns so quickly in 350F air as suggested by the oven hack, why not in 400+F oil?",2,1737423780.0,cajunfood,1,1.0,False

I buy a large (three or four shot) iced latte almost every day of the year. I was originally attracted to the ease of a Nespresso machine, but after reading, I am considering using beans and putting slightly more effort into things. 

These are my general goals/thoughts in order of importance which I am realizing may be difficult:
1. Ability to make six or eight shots quickly so that I can make two large iced lattes or shaken espressos. 
2.  I want it to taste much closer to a four shot iced latte I would buy at a coffee shop than to a higher end grocery store cold brew mixed with higher end grocery store sweet cream. 
3. I do not want to put a lot of thought or creativity into what I am doing, although generally I do have attention to detail in the kitchen. I am not interested in the academics of coffee. I just want to make solid iced lattes. 
4. I would like a machine that is not too difficult to clean. I will clean often as I am a bit of a germaphobe. 
5.  I would love if it was an all in one machine, but I am open to grinding beans separately if my goals can’t be met with an all in one. 

I am unsure of budget. I am ok spending more for ease and getting what I want, but do not want to  spend more to have the best technology or better ability to customize or be creative - as I do not want to be creative. I will commit to use filtered water and expensive beans, and to clean as needed.

1i66zy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CinematicDiversions/comments/1i66zy4/io_2019_review/,Io (2019) Review,"# To boring to hate

[https://cinematicdiversions.com/io-2019-review/](https://cinematicdiversions.com/io-2019-review/)

  
Io (2019): 3 out of 10: Pollution renders Earth virtually uninhabitable as the remaining population flees to Jupiter’s Moon Io. One shuttle to Jupiter is left and Margaret Qualley has to decide if she will be on it or stay behind to help save the earth. A fellow procrastinator (Anthony Mackie) shows up in a hot-air balloon to take her with him to catch the shuttle.

# And on to the questions.

# Are you going to quote Roger Ebert?

Why yes I am “no good movie features a hot-air balloon,” I think speaks for itself.

# So what is this movie like?

It is a combination of “The Martian” and Vincent Price’s The Last Man on Earth.

# Oh, but doesn’t that sound cool?

You would think, but The Martian took place (spoiler alert) on Mars and The Last Man on Earth had all those vampire creatures attacking every night. Plus those movies starred Matt Damon and Vincent Price respectfully while this film stars Andie MacDowell’s daughter.

# But there have to be some neat action scenes?

No, there is not. Sure they go into the dead zone wearing oxygen masks and “oh no the oxygen is getting low better change the tank” but it is like a diving movie with no sharks and no treasure… and for that matter no coral and no fish… heck, it just has fall foliage and an abandoned library with on the nose statues of Greek mythology with quotes pertinent to the story. Nothing actually happens.

# I mean, Anthony Mackie shows up that brings the excitement, yes?

Anthony Mackie is a decent actor, but if he does not bring the excitement when he is flying around in a Marvel movie, he certainly isn’t bringing it here. He and Qualley have zero chemistry together for two people that are basically the last people on earth.

# Well, if it is called Io, at least they go to Jupiter at some point, yes?

Ha, no. If I were to title this movie, it would be Indie Platform Walking Simulator the movie. This film shares a lot in common with those horrible cheap video games with poor graphics, muted grey colors, poor or non-existent gameplay and then they try to browbeat you with an unsubtle message about disability, depression or cancer to guilt you into buying it on Steam cause your last game had a cheerleader armed with a chainsaw fighting zombies.

# So you would rather watch a chainsaw-wielding cheerleader battle zombies movie?

Well, yes. But what I would have liked to see in this film is the characters interact outside of canned speech. Throw a curveball, have an erotic sex scene, have somebody drop a coffee cup. Do something. Minimalism doesn’t have to mean a lack of conflict or passion. A windstorm and finding a bee isn’t cutting it. Don’t be afraid that by entertaining, you will lose whatever cred you were going for.",1,1737422746.0,CinematicDiversions,0,1.0,False

Dealing with Abilify, wellbutrin, SSRI induced anhedonia + Mood disorder from SSRI withdrawl  
for almost 5 months since i got off (Almost cold turkey)  
(Before medication i had no mood related issues, took it for anxiety)

1. I noticed i usual get into a full despair and anhedonic mode especially right after Panic attack (Or having a huge anxiety symptom)
2. I feel suicidal, mood swing, despair along with emotional numbess (Both at the same time) Do all people in this forum also have above symptoms as well?
3. Feel dizzy, vomitting, slight tramble, very sedating especially in the morning (But mostly, after i use Essential oil Or eat ginsang herb, funny thing is i was totally okay using it) (It has something to do with hormonal imbalance : adrenal, Estrogen, high serotonin. etc)
4. Lowering insulin through healthy diet didn't really help with my mood (Also exercising made things even worse)
5. Coffee usually gives me an instant boost of physical energy + better mood and back to normal (But the effect of caffeine doesn't last long enough after using abilify) (Increasing dopamine level through coffee didn't completely solve anhedonia or ability to feel deep, I think dopamine is not the only one causing this problem)
6. Haven't tried supplements (Or substances known to cure anhedonia) because they always seemed to cure my mood issue at first but after my gets used to it (Tolerance or something), it ultimately made my symptoms even worse after discontinue it
7. Taking probiotics made my anxiety worse but better mood, however eating probiotic gut friendly natural foods didn't really help me.

**Medications such as abilify and ssri are very widely used ADs, but why only few of people**  
**go through this insanity?**

**If it all happened because of some sort of nutritional deficiencies or adrenal issue or thyroid issue**  
**then why people out there having a similar problem have no anhedonia?**

In Connecticut I have a Home Improvement Contractors license where I’m allowed under this license to do structural work. I rarely do commercial work, but occasionally tile a bathroom or renovate a coffee shop. 

I’m confused as to what license I should be obtaining in South Carolina. Should I get a general contractors license or a residential builders license? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I’ve called the residential builders commission once but just learned about the “General contractor license.” I want to get ahead of this now so I can have my license prior to arriving.

Just assume I'm going through a whole thesaurus entry of ""bad"" on this whole thing.  The marriage is long past but this story remains.

Despite Bestie being in a relationship with sentient pond scum, I was still helping her with the wedding as maid of honor.  She knew I disliked him and his whole genetic line, but sometimes you can't stop someone from doing excessively stupid things.  so we are working on the guest list, trying to cut a huge family and social circle down to the max the reception site allowed, 60 people  This was made harder because her father in law was insisting that he could have one third of the guest list himself, 20 people.  His logic that he was paying for one third of the reception, so he had a third say in the guest list.  Oh, and he didn't want to use any of those 20 people to be family.  Family members were in the other 2/3, this was just for his friends.

The problem was, he and his wife were such difficult people that they were struggling to find 20 people to add to their portion.  Bestie sent out invites, got back rsvps that mostly said no from his friends.  So he insisted we do a second round of invites to a secondary list he came up with.  Finally, the wedding is drawing near and he gave us his tertiary list, still trying to fill in the 30 spots he claimed.  Bestie meanwhile was asking if he could possibly just give over some of those spots for her rather large family.  Nope.

So one person off of this third try list was Besties father in law's office mate.  We get back the RSVP just before the cut off for giving a headcount for the venue.  The office mates RSVP included a rambling letter scolding my Bestie for daring to invite someone and not include the kids in the invite.  Now again, this was from man that neither the bride nor groom had ever seen.  And he is just scolding my Bestie by name.

Then was his RSVP, which he scribbled all over.  He included his wife and their SIX children.  We later found out these were kids from each of their previous marriages, plus two kids they had together. They ranged in age from 10 down to an 3 month old infant.

Bestie went to her father in-law saying she didn't want someone this rude at her wedding.  But father in law put his foot down, saying they were invited.  All of them.  Did I mention he himself had never met his coworkers wife or kids?  

Of course the RSVPs listed their meals as filet mignon.  All of them.  There was a kids meal offered, but apparently even the 3 month old needed steak.

Bestie gave in. Let it happen.  She literally had to ask some friends to stay home to make space for the coworker and his brood of stranger friends
friends. There were tears. There was fighting.

And the day of the wedding, the whole family was a no show.  

You had tables that sat eight, and there was just one whole table empty.  Awkward and obvious.

The fallout afterward was profound.  The coworker sent a ""wedding present"" home with Besties Father in Law.  It was a coffee maker with a Goodwill sticker on it.  He also was really angry that no one saved his family cake, ""everyone knows kids love cake""

I dont think in the end that he ever planned to show up.  Turned out the coworker was in a massive dispute with the father in law that ended up in court.

The marriage lasted three years.

I have been looking for a coffee table to this space for a long time and I’d appreciate your help. Everyone around me is tired of me sending them some coffee table pictures:)) I tried 4 so far but I had to return all. (Please ignore the TV above fireplace since we use it as a frame TV) The sectional is 125x125 with inner dimensions 82x82. Here are my concerns:
- Wood coffee table: I don’t prefer orangish tones to not to have more of it in my space, and other colors are hard to match. I dont like too dark colors and light colors did not match.
- Tried glass one (westelm mid century), but the glass was shaking when moving around and it did not fit with the sofa style.
- Tried beige round marble from Antropoligie, but light beige was hard to work with for this space.
- Tried modernist from C&B, but silver clashed with existing brass and black. Felt too busy. 

I’s appreciate any kind of help in finding a coffee table. I usually prefer not busy, not too colorful spaces, more on the modern side. But I like my current fireplace and dont want to renovate it if possible.

Did you know that the ‘sweets’ we love so much may be the beginning of an illness we don’t want to encounter?,"Hey there! Have you ever felt like life just isn’t sweet enough without desserts? But wait! Did you know that all this sweetness could lead you straight to a not-so-sweet condition—diabetes! 🩸💉

# 1. Symptoms of Diabetes

Ever woken up at night feeling crazy thirsty? Or peeing so often your friends joke you're watering the crops? 🤔 These could be red flags for diabetes! Check yourself: sudden weight loss, slow-healing wounds, or that annoying tingling in your hands and feet. Yep, your body’s sending out warning signals!

# 2. Causes of Diabetes

Think diabetes only comes from eating too many sweets? Think again! Sure, sugary snacks play a role, but the real culprits include genetics, obesity, lack of exercise, and, let’s face it, all that ‘just-one-more-bite’ snacking. 🍔🍟



# 3. Type 1 vs. Type 2 Diabetes

Diabetes is like a TV drama—it’s got two main storylines

* Type 1: The body stops making insulin completely, so our hero needs to rely on insulin shots for life.
* Type 2: The villain here? Unhealthy habits make the insulin we have stop working properly.

Both need attention, but trust me, this is one drama you don’t want in your life!

# 4. Complications from Diabetes

Think diabetes is just ‘a little sugar problem’? Oh no! Ignoring it can lead to action-movie-level complications like heart attacks, kidney failure, blindness, or even losing a limb! So, what’s it going to be? A sweet life or… a really bitter ending? 😱

# 5. Managing Diabetes

Here’s the good news! You *can* manage diabetes. Here’s how:

1. Eat better—cut back on the sugar and fried food.
2. Move your body—30 minutes of exercise a day can do wonders.
3. Visit your doctor regularly for checkups. 🩺

Small steps, big results!

# Did you know? Some Japanese people eat rice three times a day and don’t get diabetes! Why? They pair it with loads of veggies! 🥗 Meanwhile, us? Sticky rice and mango, iced coffee, and bubble tea galore. 😂

# 6. 'I Don’t Want to Change!'

Some might say, ‘But I don’t want to give up my favorite desserts!’ You don’t have to! Just choose smarter: swap cakes for fruits or go for low-sugar drinks instead of soda. You can still indulge but without the health risks!

  
Remember, good health isn’t something you can buy—it’s something you build. Start today and choose a sweeter, healthier life! ❤️",1,1737420647.0,HealthBringsWealth,0,1.0,False

Enter ChatGPT chatbots, the new trailblazers in customer support. They are not just revolutionizing the game; they are completely reshaping consumer interactions.

When you think about traditional customer service, long wait times, repetitive music loops, and the monotony of scripted responses often come to mind. However, the advent of ChatGPT chatbots is steering us away from this outdated model. These AI-driven assistants are available 24/7, providing immediate responses to customer inquiries without the need for coffee breaks or sleep.

ChatGPT technology is rooted in a deep understanding of language, capable of interpreting and responding in natural, human-like ways. This is crucial since communication is the core of customer support. Consumers don’t just want answers; they want to feel heard and understood, and ChatGPT chatbots excel at providing this level of engagement. Imagine a scenario where you can instantly resolve a billing issue or navigate a company’s product line with the help of a helpful bot that seems to understand your needs just as well as a human would.

One of the most significant benefits of chatbots is their scalability. They can handle an influx of thousands of customer queries without breaking a sweat. This feature ensures that during peak times, like holiday sales or product launches, customers still receive timely support. Plus, the cost savings for businesses are substantial when you consider the reduction in workforce requirements.

Moreover, ChatGPT chatbots collect valuable data with each interaction, leading to more personalized experiences. They can track your preferences, past purchases, and even anticipate your future needs. Businesses can utilize these insights to tailor their services, offers, and products, leading to a more satisfied customer base.

Critics might raise concerns about the impersonal nature of bots or their incapacity to handle complex issues. Yet, the AI behind ChatGPT is persistently evolving, bridging this gap with every update. It's clear that these chatbots are becoming an indispensable part of customer service arsenals.

While some fear that these AI might replace human jobs, the reality is that they are more likely to complement human roles, taking over mundane tasks and freeing up human agents to tackle more complex and emotionally nuanced issues.

As ChatGPT chatbots continue to improve, it’s exciting to think about the potential of these AI systems in shaping the future of customer support. They are a testament to how technological innovation can be harnessed to enhance human interaction and revolutionize industries. What are your thoughts or experiences with ChatGPT in customer service? Have you witnessed an improvement or face any challenges?

He was physically and extremely emotionally abusive almost my whole life, he has been financially abusive to the point my brother and I grew up malnourished despite him earning £250k plus annually as he refused to buy groceries, or pay household bills… he pulled me out of the school I was flourishing in to place me somewhere cheaper and I was bullied, he did the same with my brother. He helped my brother with university but not me as I am a girl. He has called us both every name under the sun and been viciously homophobic to my brother and misogynistic towards me. He has berated us and mocked us and resented us for having ‘more’ than he did growing up, although we never did. He used to beat us and he deliberately broke our toys, never allowed us to have doors closed up to the age of 25 (we still lived at home due to extreme mental health effects of this control and abuse). He has never showed any remorse for any of this whatsoever. He has evident cognitive limitations as well as being a typical narcissist. I didn’t speak to him for a few years but then was forced to see him during the divorce to mediate between my parents. He sold our house from under us and my Mum had to move into a one bedroom flat instead of the five bedroom home she had decorated and thought she’d live in forever. I moved in with my boyfriend and have struggled with very poor mental health, unemployment, and mystery physical health issues that I’m pretty certain stem from the stress and anguish of my childhood and adolescence. I tried to coexist with him and be civil after my parents divorce around four years back but - the way he never showed remorse or talked about anything he’d done to me, the way he never behaved like a parent, not even paying for my coffee when meeting up, for instance, made me feel I was doing myself a disservice. I didn’t block him but stopped messaging and he never attempted to reach out to me, not even to check if I was alright. I am poor. My boyfriend is disabled. My life is so hard and I cry every week as I’m worried I will not be in a position to have children by the end of my child bearing years as a result. He has cost me my twenties. I should have been working but I have been recovering. I thought I was mostly done.

Flash forward to the present day. 

On New Year’s Day (narcissists always come out of the woodwork around significant dates and holidays as we all know) he sent me a cryptic message addressed to both of us (he has never treated us as or respected us as individuals) saying he had something important to share and would love to reconnect over coffee. I had a panic attack because I was sure it meant he was 1) remarrying someone doubtlessly my age or younger or 2) having another child. I didn’t want to open myself up to an ambush especially with the entirety of everything he has cost me being left unsaid only for him to doubtlessly spring more trauma on me. My Mum and partner told me not to catastrophise and ignore it, Mum said she’d try to find out through the grapevine and let me know what was wrong. I didn’t see her for a few weeks as she was abroad and tried not to think about it. Well I saw her yesterday and my brother and I sat me down and told me my father has an approximately one year old child and is living with some Eastern European woman who speaks no English and is in her mid to late thirties at best. 

I don’t think I need to explain why this is such a shock to me. How can he still find ways to reject and harm me, how can he casually message me saying he ‘has news’ and ‘would love to reconnect’ but understands if we’re not ready, how can he address the vague message to BOTH of us despite it being this serious, how can he not have told us during the pregnancy or even when this child was born? How can he be raising a child when he didnt raise us? How can he still not even attempt a ‘sorry.’ How can he think I’d have taken this news over coffee and not been sick or passed out? How can he think this is fair?

He has completely screwed us with regards to his will, I’m sure members of this group understand but I settled the fact I would never benefit from him with myself years ago, but told myself at least when he dies I’ll receive a small sum to put towards something that heals me, and in some way makes up for the neglect. Even a small sum, to have a single holiday (I haven’t had one in ten years and I’m only young myself), or to have a modest home… I would genuinely be okay with him leaving us nothing if it didn’t mean he would be leaving it to this new child in our stead when we are the ones who have suffered immeasurably and certainly financially in terms of lost earnings, having to pay for incredibly expensive therapy when the NHS could not support our needs and neglect. It is intolerable to me. I am even more indignant about this on my brothers behalf. My aunt (fathers cousin) who told my Mum about this said she believes that while my father is responsible as a man obviously he is cognitively declining and the woman has clearly entrapped him for settlement and financial reasons. She is a lawyer herself so I doubt she is just saying this, she hates my father and does not speak to him but heard it all from her mother. Now he will doubtlessly cut us out and spend all of his assets on raising this new child. I have a half sibling I wouldn’t recognise on the street who is almost thirty years younger than me. When he is my age I will be around 60. I went to the doctors for an emergency appointment and to be put in therapy and I sobbed in the waiting room thinking about how every single element of my mental issues are caused by my father whether I am in touch with him or not. I have been fine in medicated and not in therapy finally moving on and he has dealt me this blow. I am actually a very wise and resilient person who has been completely overwhelmed by abuse and neglect. Without him I doubt I’d have more than basic depression. I struggle to function and he has taken the energy out of the first half of my life. He has replaced us. I am stressed about the will, about getting legal advice, about ownership of my grandmothers grave even as it is a double grave and I don’t want him to be buried in it, he also has several of her possessions I want back and ALL our childhood videos and albums. I don’t know if this makes sense I know there it too much information and not enough detail here but I feel I am losing my mind, and don’t know where else to turn. My brother is less upset as he has no good memories of my father in childhood which I honestly envy. But I thought he loved me once, albeit when I was very young. I cannot believe he wouldn’t even tell me this. I am really processing it for the first time that he does not even care about me. I am also frustrated that he has made it impossible for us to ever have a relationship with said child even if we wanted to by lying to this extent that we did not know he was born. How could he not reach out on the day it happened if not during the pregnancy? I could not stomach ever even hearing about the woman involved and I cannot force myself to pretend anymore that any of this is okay, my brother and I need to finally begin to put ourselves first. 

Any similar experiences, support, or advice would be SO appreciated. I feel so alone. ",9,1737420281.0,EstrangedAdultKids,3,1.0,False

I would love insight from an Avoidant- I just want to get over  my DA(?) ex but also just miss him so badly. My ex told me I was the only person he's discarded and I'm so confused.**

I've decided not to date for a long time after this but I'm genuinely confused and want to fix whatever is broken within me that's causing this to happen. Because Ive dated 2 DAs prior to this and I just want to attract secure partners.

I met my ex in March at the coffee shop I work at when he ran in, saw me, stopped and told me how beautiful my eyes were. He was so forward and seemingly written out of a book. He had charm, charisma, and made me feel like I was floating. We didnt see each other again or date until July but during that gap, he was asking our mutual friends about me and began pursuing me pretty heavily. I should've listened to my body because I felt anxiety about how fast he was trying to move and how immediately I was showered with compliments and affection. I had some friends who were concerned but others who really thought it was genuine.

We connected when I got out of an abusive relationship and ended up talking for hours on end, multiple nights in a row. We quickly got hooked onto each other and moved at an unhealthy pace. He told me he had a good family history and had previously been in a 4 year relationship - he seemed secure to me. He took me on a date the next week and we stayed up until 8am just talking. He ended up staying the night and we got intimate the next morning.

I told him i wanted to start slow bc i was alarmed at the speed he was going and I had just gotten out of a relationship. After we got intimate on our first date, he said something like ""I dont even know what we're doing"" and laughed and kept offering a ""go with the flow"" ""i do you, you do me"" but we remain committed to each other and head towards a relationship. I told him I wanted to date with intention and that he didnt want a situationship and he completely agreed but was still pretty vague with actual intentions. He was pretty busy with running and work, but saw me whenever he could. He would come into my work and kiss me very publicly, kiss me in the middle of my sentences, interrupt me to tell me how lovely and beautiful I was, and tell me how safe he felt with me. The ""safe"" thing always worried me because my previous DA ex would say that too. But our chemistry was unlike anything I had experienced and he truly seemed like a hopeless romantic, written out of a book. He would play me soul music in the morning, cook for me always, and was simply just so sweet on me.

I started to notice in the beginning that he would shut down when anything emotional came up. Or if I told him how i felt about him and gave him compliments, he would change the subject or make it lighthearted somehow. He asked me about my abusive mom in the beginning and once he noticed I was tearing up, he went to go shower mid-sentence and came back without saying a word. A couple of weeks later, I fell down the stairs and he didnt ask if i was okay and refused to talk about it.. He didnt even come down, he just stood at the top until I got up (i was pretty bruised. it was a hard fall). He never said a word about it after that, even if i brought up my bruise or how silly that was.

After a month, he had some big life changes. He quit his job (he has quit a lot of jobs.. this time to pursue modeling which has not panned out.) and he moved into a new house. During this time, he stopped calling me beautiful, stopped showering me with affection, and started to be pretty distant but would be great in person. He didnt initiate hangouts as much or visit me at work as often, but said he was busy. I noticed that anytime I would bring up a need, he would shut down or avoid what i said altogether and just change the subject into something really lighthearted.

When it came to his past relationships , he always mentioned that they never talked about things. That me having basic conversations about dating expectations were as far as he had gotten in communication with other ex's. He had gotten out of a 4 year relationship less than a year before. They started off long distance, then both moved to our state together and he has described their relationship as very toxic.. She was avoidant and their relationship had a rocky start bc he had sex with his ex while they were casually dating, wanting to keep her side of the relationship polyamorous but always accused him of cheating, though he's very monogamous. They went to couples therapy and tried what they could. He said they both just randomly lost feelings. He would post the SWEETEST things about her and seemed so emotionally available with her, but he told me he was just trying to fix things.. But the way he treated her online was how he treated me in the beginning. He was the sweetest boy I had ever met before things suddenly changed.His other ex relationships he said lasted 6 months and they both broke up with him out of the blue. (one was his roommate that overlapped with his last ex. They continued to live together even while he and his recent ex dated) He also described them as push pull but said he would still always go visit them at work, went official with them, and was upset because they didnt want to remain friends. though i get confused because he told me they told him he was very robotic and cold towards them in the end.

One day out of nowhere, about 2 months in he told me he didnt have time for a relationship and that maybe i wanted too much from him that he couldnt give based on his running schedule (he started to become ""too busy"" and didnt want to lose himself to a relationship). But once he offered friendship and I said no, his heart seemed broken and he told me he had no intention on breaking up with me but wanted to see how our lives fit together with his schedule. We agreed on only seeing each other 1x a week so that he could focus on running and prioritize his life, although this felt really shitty on my end. I tried my best to be supportive, even though i was feeling really anxious and heartbroken.

When i would try to bring things up or ask for reassurance (before you come at me, i did my best to be very ""chill cool girl"" about it), he would shut down and not respond and then later come back with a response that was SO reassuring that even my therapist and friends were fooled. It made me think i was overthinking it all and he really was just an overly laid back guy with ADHD. He'd apologize and say hed work on being better at communicating. Communication was AWFUL at this point. (very inconsistent, all about his schedule, mostly about him, mostly about trail running..) No matter how anxious he'd make me,  he always reassured me, was still VERY physically affectionate (though not in public anymore. again, when i started to show it back he stepped back), and mainly just limited physical sweet connection to sex. But he would say things that made me think i was still just overthinking it all.

**T**hen finally, we had the best weekend and then he went on a 10 day running trip. He was so distant while he was gone, but this wasnt anything i wasnt used to at this point, and he would post on Instagram without checking in (which is fine but he was very blatantly ignoring me lol). He'd respond to me in the morning and then send a message right before bed, but was online all throughout the day and said he didnt do much throughout the days. I sent a text asking if he could just sends a heads up if he didnt want to talk that day (i tried to make it v sweet and not accusatory) and he ignored me all night. I sent another text apologizing and blaming myself for asking too much -- this was the biggest spiral i had gone into lol i really try not to show it to him. and then he responded in the morning with a text kind of brushing it over, apologizing, saying it wasnt a big expectation and he understood, and then a million other texts about running.

He always would say he'd do better, but would end up being more distant than before. But then when we were together, hed get really sweet and have moments where he acted in love like he did in the beginning.. But the amount of distance starting to overshadow the good. But the good would be SO GOOD and he'd be so sweet again.

We went a few weeks seeing each other in between his trip and mine, taking each other to and from the airport and when we finally were done with our trips he was being so sweet again and I was so excited that things were seeming normal once again. He picked me up from the airport and the next morning, he took me out to a diner and again, something seemed so off. I asked him what was going on and he said ""I just want to be friends"" (he had no intentions of telling me that day and i had just stayed the night at his house)

He told me that he didnt see me romantically and there was no possibility of him seeing me romantically. He was INSISTENT on being friends and having me in his life, doing all of the same things that we had before like talking about life, going to concerts, etc, but not as frequently. He told me he just didnt desire me and that he no longer wanted to make me a priority in his life.. he also kept going back and forth between saying that i was the ""only person he's lost interest in like this"" and ""this is a pattern and he doesn't know why he does it"". ?????? He told me about his other relationships and how they left him out of nowhere (he has this belief that people always leave, which we talked about in the beginning), and how he wanted to try with them but they just left and  
didnt want to be friends.. Though he said he was told he was robotic with them.. How his other relationships were very push pull and with me, he just didnt have a desire to ""come back"" like he did in his other relationships. He said he used to be able to see a future with me and now he cant. That we're a ""mismatch"" and ""incompatible"" but he cant give me any answers as to why.

he told me i had done nothing wrong and had only been supportive and loving from the start. he said he didnt lost any attraction for me and there was no one else, that he couldn't even date right now if he tried. but he simply didnt see me romantically and still wanted friendship with me. he said he had been contemplating this before his trip and was wondering why he didnt desire me, but didnt have any answers.. he really said i was the only person hes done this to. He seemed like he didnt care other than just feeling guilt and he wanted to meet the following week to talk about being friends.

Then he went on a trip and was stone cold towards me (I hardly texted him, just to figure out the logistics of when we'd meet up. I dated a DA before and was trying to be respectful of the assumed space he'd need.) He was cold towards me until we eventually made it work for him to come to my house two weeks later.

When he finally came to my house, i told him i couldnt have him in my life. But then it was the first time i hadnt seen him as his usual positive and sweet self. He looked horrible and started talking for an hour about how he cant get a job, cant keep anyone close in his life (literally said his two closest people live with him and its out of convenience. he hasnt even known them a year and neither of them tell him really anything in their lives.) He was telling me about how horrible his life was and how he made it this way and this was all his fault.. I had never heard him talk like this before and honestly was shocked. Again, he comes off as very charming and secure. I also confronted that I saw him on Hinge and he said his friend made him make one, but ive still seen him on it despite ""not having time for a relationship""

He told me he did care and we kind of started talking about nonsense for an hour (literally the most random light things).. then suddenly he started holding me, crying. Then told me I was so perfect in our relationship and didnt do anything wrong and that hed be waiting for me whenever i was ready for friendship. That hed have his schedule ready and hed always be there.

He left and I reached out a few weeks later on Thanksgiving. I reached out because my friend said he started coming around the bar that my friends work at (he lives outside of our city) and was going there during the day, seeming really lonely and trying to get back into our friend's lives. I missed him so much and just sent him a text that I hoped he was doing well, was surrounded by love, and sent him some film photos I had just received of him from the month prior.

No response.

And then tonight, I crashed out and sent him a long text about what he did to me and how his actions have affected me. I know I probably shouldn’t have but I think I just spent so much of our relationship and breakup trying to help him and taking the blame, that my heartache turned to one last desperate attempt in poorly getting his attention.

Despite all of this, im sad and i miss who i had in the beginning. I miss who I thought was my person. I want him back so badly but know thats never going to happen. I guess I'm here because I know he's not going to respond and I'm never going to get the closure I need from him, but I want to hear from an avoidants perspective.

\- Why did he give his other ex's years of his time and he couldnt handle 4 months with me?  
\- Why did he discard, hold me crying, beg for friendship, then not respond when I reached out?

\- Is this truly avoidant or something else? He seems anxious in other relationships and tried couples therapy with his ""abusive' ex until he lost feelings.

\- How do I cope with being the ""only one"" he has discarded like this?

\- Honestly any insight you can give is helpful. I feel insane and have tried to rationalize this, but it feels like nothing helps me understand what went wrong when he said multiple times that i was only supportive and loving, never asking for too much and being ""perfect"". He has told me its him and not me, but my heart cant cope with the thought that I'm the ""one off"" to him.

I've tried everything from EMDR, weekly therapy, and even talking with a relationship coach that specializes in avoidant attachment... Everyone says I'm not the problem, but I cant help feel blame and confused that I'm the ""one off"" of discards in his life.. How do I truly move on?",1,1737420226.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone.

So I’m a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I’m married, have a good and great paying job, travel a lot, and living a life most would be envious of.

But I’m also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it’s exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they’re decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I’m a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

You? Just be cool. I don’t have stipulations other than you at least try to have convo. I want to be seen and heard and I want someone I lol forward to talking to.

Is that you?",1,1737420091.0,chat,1,1.0,False

Is there an affordable coffee, generic or name brand, whole beans or ground, that tastes like Starbucks Espresso?
