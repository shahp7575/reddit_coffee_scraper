**Working Conditions for Minors (Ages 15 to 17) in Korea**

Bongsoo Jung, a Korean labor attorney at KangNam Labor Law Firm

 

**I. Introduction**

Minors are in the process of growing up as adults, so they are less developed physically and mentally, and receive special protection because they are legally required to go to school.[^(\[1\])](#_ftn1) Korea’s Constitution (Article 32, Paragraph 5) stipulates that special protection shall be accorded to working minors, and Chapter 5 of the Labor Standards Act specifically describes the working conditions of minors. Minors work as short-term workers, fixed-term workers, and workplace trainees in 24-hour convenience stores, fast food restaurants, and production plants. Therefore, when considering their working conditions, it is necessary to consider the conditions at workplaces with fewer than 5 workers in mind. For field trainees in particular, working conditions vary by whether they are working as students or workers.

All the protections in the Labor Standards Act (LSA) apply to working minors as well as adult workers. This includes the prohibitions against discrimination, forced labor, and violence, restrictions on unfair dismissal and managerial layoffs, and the requirement to issue written employment contracts. However, in workplaces with fewer than 5 employees, dismissal restrictions, shut-down allowances, additional wages for overtime work, and annual paid allowances do not apply.[\[2\]](#_ftn2)

 I would like to list the working conditions for minors in detail by sections and special protection regulations together. In addition, I will examine whether trainees are students or workers in legal disputes.

 

**II. Scope of Working Minors and Occupations from which They Are Prohibited**

**1. Scope of Working Minors**

 In principle, no person under the age of 15 shall be employed as a worker. However, those 13 to 15 years of age with an employment permit issued by the Minister of Employment and Labor may be so employed, as long as the employment does not interfere with their compulsory education (Article 64 of the LSA and Article 35 of its Enforcement Decree). The employer shall keep in the workplace a certificate proving the family relationships and written consent from their parent or guardian for each working minor under 18 (Article 66).

 

**2. Prohibited Occupations**

 Under the Labor Standards Act, employers cannot assign pregnant women or those under 18 years of age to work that involves moral or health hazards or danger (Article 65). Prohibited occupations include high-pressure work and diving work, jobs or businesses that prohibit the employment or entry of children under the age of 18, work in prisons and mental hospitals, work in incineration and slaughter, and work dealing with oil.[\[3\]](#_ftn3)  However, they can be employed for gas station refueling service for passenger vehicles.

 Employers shall not assign women or minors under the age of 18 to work in mines except where the work is temporarily needed to perform the certain duties such as health, medicine, news reporting, news coverage, etc. (Article 72). [\[4\]](#_ftn4)   

Employers shall not abuse workers in training, workers on probation or any other apprentice whose purpose is to acquire a technical skill, or assign them to domestic work or other work not related to the acquirement of technical skill (Article 77).

Businesses where entry and employment of minors (under the age of 19) is prohibited under the Youth Protection Act (Article 2, Item 5) are:

(1) Businesses where minors are prohibited from entering or working: entertainment and other bars, video rooms, karaoke rooms (businesses with facilities that make it legal for minors to enter are excluded from the entry ban), telephone rooms, dancing academies, dancing rooms, businesses involving speculative behavior, and those involving the handling of sexual devices.

(2) Businesses prohibited from hiring minors: Accommodation, barber shops, bathing businesses in which a massage room is set up or which is divided into private rooms, tobacco retail, toxic product manufacturing, sales and handling, ticket coffee shop, places selling alcohol like soju bars, beer bars, cafes, etc., music record sales, video sales and rental shops, general game rooms, and comic book rental shops.

 

**III. Special Protection of Labor Contracts**

 Employers seeking to hire minors shall draw up employment contracts for the minors to sign if they so desire in the same position in determining the working conditions (Article 4). In this case, the parents[\[5\]](#_ftn5) or guardians[\[6\]](#_ftn6) cannot act on behalf of the minor, but if the employment contract is deemed unfavorable to the minor, they can terminate it later (Article 67). Under the Civil Act, those under the age of 19 cannot engage in legal actions such as signing contracts independently, and so may engage in legal actions only with the consent of a parent or guardian. So, in the Labor Standards Act, those under the age of 18 must submit consent from their parents at the time of employment. However, working minors may independently engage in legal actions such as claiming wages and joining a labor union.

 The employer must write and deliver the necessary items in the working minor’s employment contract, and if working conditions are changed, a revised employment contract must be issued (Article 17). The written contents shall include: ① (Wages) Wage composition, calculation method, and payment method; ② (Contractual working hours) shall be determined within the legal working hours for minors (7 hours per day, 35 hours per week); ③ (Weekly holidays) If workers work more than 15 hours a week, they are entitled to an average of 1 or more paid weekly holidays per week; ④ (Paid Leave) Workplaces with five or more employees must guarantee monthly paid leave and annual paid leave; ⑤ (Place of employment and work to be engaged in).

 

**IV. Wages**

 Employers must pay wages directly, in currency, and in full to working minors, at least once a month on a fixed date (Article 43). When working minors quit or the working relationship is terminated due to dismissal, any owed wages, severance pay, and other money shall be paid within 14 days of the termination (Article 36). Employers must not pay wages to the parents of their minor workers (Article 68). If working children are unable to provide work due to reasons attributable to the employer, they shall be paid 70% of their average wage (Article 46). If an emergency situation such as illness or accident occurs and working minors require immediate payment of wages for work performed before the request date in order to cover the related expenses, employers shall pay wages ahead of payday (Article 45).

Wages must be set at minimum wage at least, and cannot be lowered on account of the worker being a minor. However, for unskilled minors who have signed an employment contract for at least one year, the minimum wage may be reduced up to 10% for the probationary first 3 months. However, this is not applicable to simple labor work (Article 5 of the Minimum Wage Act, or “MWA”).

If working children quit after continuing to work for one year or more, severance pay equal to the 30 days’ average wage per year of continual work shall be paid (MWA, Article 34). However, there is no obligation to pay severance pay if the average working hours are fewer than 15 per week for each 4 week period. If some months the minor works an average of fewer than 15 hours per week and some months the minor works an average of 15 hours or more per week, only the months in which the minor worked an average of 15 hours or more per week are calculated, and severance pay is incurred only when such period is one year or longer (Article 18).

 

**V. Special Protection of Working Hours and Rest**

 The working hours of persons aged 15 to 18 shall not exceed 7 hours per day and 35 hours per week. However, this may be extended by up to 1 hour per day and 5 hours per week if there is agreement between the parties. Since 1 week refers to 7 days including holidays, the longest working hours for working minors shall be 40 hours a week. Therefore, flexible working hours and selective working hours are not applicable to working minors (MWA, Articles 51 and 52).

  An employer shall allow a recess period of 30 minutes or more for every 4 working hours and at least 1 hour for every 8 working hours during the work day. During these rest hours, rest should be freely available to working minors (Article 54).

If working minors continue to work for 15 hours or more per week, they are given paid weekly holidays (Article 55). If they have completed their contractual working hours for one week, they are entitled to a weekly leave allowance of one or more days (Article 55). The weekly leave allowance for working minors is determined according to the ratio calculated by the working hours of ordinary workers engaged in the same type of work at the workplace, just as the working conditions for part-time workers (Article 18).[\[7\]](#_ftn7)

When working minors have worked for more than the contractual working hours, employers must pay overtime allowance amounting to 50% or more of the normal wage, in addition to the normal wage (Article 6 of the Fixed-Term Employment Act).

Employers are not allowed to have those under the age of 18 work from 10 pm to 6 am or on holidays, unless the employer obtains the consent of those under the age of 18 and approval from the Minister of Employment and Labor (Article 70). According to the approval standards of the Ministry of Employment and Labor,[\[8\]](#_ftn8) if nighttime operations are inevitable for fast food restaurants where many minors work part-time, in consideration of the safety of working children, their health, and protecting their ability to learn during the day, the limit is 12 midnight, unless approval from the Minister of Employment and Labor is gained for special reasons. Here, the term “special reasons” refers to cases where the necessity for night work is accepted and will have no detrimental effect on the health of working minors.

Employers shall give 15 days of annual leave when working minors have attended the workplace for at least 80% of the contracted work hours during one year. Employers shall also provide one day of paid leave for each month to working minors who have continued to work for less than one year or those who have attended the workplace for less than 80 percent of the contracted work hours during one year (Article 60).

 

**VI. Coverage by the Four Major Social Insurances**

 In principle, coverage by the four major social insurances are required for working minors. However, if the on-site trainees are students who are not workers, they are not eligible. For working minors, the four insurances are applied slightly differently. (1) Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance: Applies the same as for all workplaces using workers. However, on-site trainees who are not workers are exceptionally eligible for compensation from workers' compensation (Article 123 of the Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance Act). (2) Employment Insurance: Working minors who are employed for 1 day or longer are covered by employment insurance, but short-time workers with fewer than 60 working hours per month are excluded. (3) National Pension and National Health Insurance: The national pension is mandatory for those aged 18 or over and under 60 who work at a workplace. However, the National Health Insurance applies to all workers working in the workplace, regardless of age. The same applies to daily workers whose employment period is shorter than one month, and short-time workers whose contractual working hours per month are fewer than 60.

 

**VII. Legal Issues related to Working Children**

Whether or not the trainees in third grade of vocational high school are workers depends on whether or not they are students. If the main purpose for field training is to develop practical learning abilities to earn high school credits, they cannot be considered workers. However, if on-site trainees are recognized as having a subordinate relationship with the employer, they are considered workers under the Labor Standards Act.

**1. Student Status**[**\[9\]**](#_ftn9)

In accordance with the Industrial Education Promotion Act, 2 + 1 year public high school students take the 3rd year (1 year) course as students during the 3rd year of high school and engaged in industrial field training. A standard agreement is signed between the business, the school, and the students, and the students engage in on-site practice according to the on-site practice plan prepared in consultation with the business and the school. The business is supposed to evaluate trainee performance during on-the-job training according to the standards set by the school and notify the school of the results. Field training is a part of the curriculum in accordance with the Industrial Education Promotion Act and aims to help students acquire the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for them to engage in industry in the future. In this case, it is difficult to see the trainee as a worker who provides work for the purpose of wages.

**2. Worker status**[**\[10\]**](#_ftn10)

 Applicants who are expected to graduate are considered workers, if a subordinate relationship is recognized, and the Labor Standards Act is applied. In other words, even if they are trainees who are expected to graduate from high school and their working period is temporary, it cannot be concluded that they are not covered by the Labor Standards Act only for these reasons. In cases where it is recognized that there is a subordinate relationship pursuant to Article 2 of the Labor Standards Act based on the actual relationship between the employer and the trainee regarding the employment contract, the nature and content of work, and whether or not compensation is paid, the Labor Standards Act shall apply to the trainee.

 

**VIII. Conclusion**

Working minors are in their mental and physical growth stages, and since education should be given priority, they need special protection beyond that needed by adult workers. Chapter 5 of the Labor Standards Act specifies the details of this special protection. Recently, there have been many cases of industrial accidents involving students in field training, so special caution is required. Because working minors are still developing physically and mentally, they absolutely need special protection. All special protection requirements for working minors are mandatory regulations, and employers will be liable for punishment if these regulations are violated.

(2) Businesses prohibited from hiring minors: Accommodation, barber shops, bathing businesses in which a massage room is set up or which is divided into private rooms, tobacco retail, toxic product manufacturing, sales and handling, ticket coffee shop, places selling alcohol like soju bars, beer bars, cafes, etc., music record sales, video sales and rental shops, general game rooms, and comic book rental shops.

 The employer must write and deliver the necessary items in the working minor’s employment contract, and if working conditions are changed, a revised employment contract must be issued (Article 17).

(2) Employment Insurance: Working minors who are employed for 1 day or longer are covered by employment insurance, but short-time workers with fewer than 60 working hours per month are excluded. (3) National Pension and National Health Insurance: The national pension is mandatory for those aged 18 or over and under 60 who work at a workplace. However, the National Health Insurance applies to all workers working in the workplace, regardless of age. The same applies to daily workers whose employment period is shorter than one month, and short-time workers whose contractual working hours per month are fewer than 60.

 

**VII. Legal Issues related to Working Children**

Whether or not the trainees in third grade of vocational high school are workers depends on whether or not they are students. If the main purpose for field training is to develop practical learning abilities to earn high school credits, they cannot be considered workers. However, if on-site trainees are recognized as having a subordinate relationship with the employer, they are considered workers under the Labor Standards Act.

**1. Student Status**[**\[9\]**](#_ftn9)

In accordance with the Industrial Education Promotion Act, 2 + 1 year public high school students take the 3rd year (1 year) course as students during the 3rd year of high school and engaged in industrial field training. A standard agreement is signed between the business, the school, and the students, and the students engage in on-site practice according to the on-site practice plan prepared in consultation with the business and the school. The business is supposed to evaluate trainee performance during on-the-job training according to the standards set by the school and notify the school of the results. Field training is a part of the curriculum in accordance with the Industrial Education Promotion Act and aims to help students acquire the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for them to engage in industry in the future. In this case, it is difficult to see the trainee as a worker who provides work for the purpose of wages.

**2. Worker status**[**\[10\]**](#_ftn10)

 Applicants who are expected to graduate are considered workers, if a subordinate relationship is recognized, and the Labor Standards Act is applied. In other words, even if they are trainees who are expected to graduate from high school and their working period is temporary, it cannot be concluded that they are not covered by the Labor Standards Act only for these reasons. In cases where it is recognized that there is a subordinate relationship pursuant to Article 2 of the Labor Standards Act based on the actual relationship between the employer and the trainee regarding the employment contract, the nature and content of work, and whether or not compensation is paid, the Labor Standards Act shall apply to the trainee.

 

**VIII. Conclusion**

Working minors are in their mental and physical growth stages, and since education should be given priority, they need special protection beyond that needed by adult workers. Chapter 5 of the Labor Standards Act specifies the details of this special protection. Recently, there have been many cases of industrial accidents involving students in field training, so special caution is required. Because working minors are still developing physically and mentally, they absolutely need special protection. All special protection requirements for working minors are mandatory regulations, and employers will be liable for punishment if these regulations are violated.",1,1728194707.0,Korean_Law,0,1.0,False

These items would only be available after 50 minutes into the game. They’re expensive, don’t require any recipe or components, and each provides a single permanent ability without giving any extra stats or effects. Once you buy one of these items, you can't drop it, put it in your backpack, or sell it.

Here's my idea for the items:

Winged Sandals (7000 gold): Grants permanent immunity to any movement-altering effects, like slows or roots. Basically, your hero can never be slowed.

Electrolarynx (7000 gold): Grants permanent immunity to silence.

Blackest Coffee (7000 gold): Grants permanent immunity to sleep effects.

Soul Split (7000 gold): Grants two permanent illusions that fight alongside the wearer. Melee illusions deal 33% of the wearer's damage, while ranged illusions deal 28%. Illusions take 300% incoming damage. Once an illusion is destroyed, it immediately reappears next to the wearer.

Alchemy’s Finest Pill (8000 gold): Grants permanent immunity to stuns.

Elemental Vesture (8000 gold): Puts the wearer in a permanent ethereal form, making them immune to auto attacks, but they take 40% more magic damage.

Flying Nimbus (8000 gold): Grants permanent flying movement, allowing the wearer to move over trees and terrain.

Invisibility Cloak (8000 gold): Grants permanent invisibility, even while attacking or casting spells.

Khrysalekatos (8000 gold): Gives the wearer’s auto attacks permanent true strike, meaning they always hit.

Dark Lord's Bible (9000 gold): Converts all magic damage from the wearer’s spells and items into pure damage, bypassing magic immunity and resistance.

Heartcleaver (9000 gold): Converts the wearer’s auto attack damage into pure damage, bypassing enemy armor and damage block.

In the last ten years I can count on one hand how many I can recall. One of them I will for sure never forget. 

In my dream someone who I was calling uncle was screaming at me “I wasn’t ready to go” several times. Each time they would say it, it got louder and more angry to the point it sounded very deep and demonic. It scared me to my core. I just kept saying “it’s okay uncle it’s okay. It was so angry and so scary I woke up around 330 am choking on my own vomit. It took a couple minutes for me to catch my breath and gather myself. My wife woke up to this and was totally freaked out because I’ve never had a nightmare before and I was really obviously shaken and scared. I tried to explain but it didn’t come out very good and she passed back out soon after. I laid there for a while in shock of how scary it was and fell back to sleep. 

In the morning around 8 am we were drinking coffee in the living room where we were discussing what happened. As we are having this conversation and I’m really explaining it to her in depth, the phone rang. I answered it was my aunt, my mom’s sister. She asked me to sit down and then informed me that my mother had passed away. I told her that I needed to call her back. I told my wife that she had passed and we were both stunned and confused. In part by the death but even more so the entire scenario. She is my only witness to this. 

To make it more creepy and hard to comprehend a coincidence the estimated time of death was between 3-330 am.
 
I don’t discuss this with anyone really other than my wife. Most people would just think I made it up, but this definitely happened. I know in my heart that she came to me angry that she was gone. She was young still only 53. She wasn’t ill nor was this expected by any means. She had a new granddaughter that she hadn’t spent much time with.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/3t7vS3KsYK

To be clear, the advice I am/was looking for is whether I should have addressed these issues with my mother before going low-contact. She's my mother. She's absolutely insane most of the time, but I still love her, and she has tried to help us a lot in the past with our family. Part of me feels guilty and that she deserves an explanation as to why we're backing off. To be honest, I'm hoping a conversation about her behaviours will change her... but I realize that's not likely going to happen; she's not going to change because, fundamentally, she doesn't think she is in the wrong about any of her actions. 

I'm no longer living with her during the weekdays, and I will not be returning to that arrangement. I've let work know that after my maternity leave is up, I won't be able to work in that department anymore and that I will need to move to the department closer to my home (about an hour away from my mother's). I did communicate that if they were unable to move me to the department closer to home, then I will have to discontinue working with them and find employment elsewhere.

We welcomed our second son into the world 4 weeks ago. She has met him twice now, and we've had about 3 video calls over the month since his birth. There was some tension around his birth, where she was actively attempting to push boundaries that we had laid out: 
1. We had arranged for my MIL to watch our toddler while we were in the hospital. We had planned on going home before 24hrs, but it ended up being the advice of the birthing center that we discharge just after 24hrs; this is advice they gave us after we had delivered our son. Originally, we were going to have my husband pick up our toddler before discharge so he could come meet his little brother for the first time. We weren't going to have anyone else visit at the birthing center, because we weren't planning on being there long anyways. I did tell my mother this twice in the weeks before we went in. However, the day or two before we went in, she asked when she would be allowed to come and visit us at the center. I explained again that only our son would be coming to meet his brother before we were discharged, and that she could come and visit after we had gone home. She pouted about this, and then eagerly asked if she could watch our son instead of MIL, so she could bring him into the center to meet his little brother for the first time. I, again, reminded her that we already arranged for MIL to watch him, and that my husband would be picking up our son to meet his little brother, so no one else would be coming to the center anyways. She pouted about this again. 
2. During labor, my husband and I snapped a funny photo that we shared with a few people on Snapchat (my sisters, best friend, and his brother). As it turns out, while we were in labour, my mom was harping on my sister because we weren't updating her every few minutes-an hour through the process. She said to my sister that she was so worried, because she hadn't heard anything in 3 hrs after they induced me. My sister said she was sure everything was fine, as we'd just sent her this Snapchat an hour and a half ago, and surely we wouldn't be sending Snapchats if anything was seriously wrong. Apparently, this sent my mother off, because we were leaving her out by not sending her the picture. My husband sent the photos (because I was kinda busy), and neither of us even have her on Snapchat to begin with (as far as I'm aware, she never uses it). So that, and the fact that she wasn't the *first* person to recieve a video call immediately after birth are two more things that she was causing some tension over. 

As for things with Jane, her two children from her home country have finally come to Canada after months of them being separated. Her partner (the baby's father) is finishing his work contract before he will be able to also make the move here, but the paperwork is in motion and soon they'll be able to have their family's happily ever after. She is currently looking for a place out of my mother's household, as the emotional and mental abuse has been escalating. My sisters and I are trying to help her find affordable housing (in a very unaffordable Province and area), and she is hoping to be able to move out by January. 

I haven't had a lot of contact with my mother over this last month. She used to call nigh daily on video call. Over the last few months, I've been either ignoring or actively declining the calls; a lot of the time she just picks shit times to call (like around bedtime for our toddler, or when I've already told her we had plans for the day). We also haven't been going to her house near as much as we had in the past (and honestly, half the time when we do go, she's off in her own world, ignoring us anyways). 

I still haven't discussed things with her. She has a lot of social/work-type obligations at the moment, which will be coming to a head in two weeks and Peter off immediately after. I'm worried she will start pressuring me to include her in our lives to the same degree she had been before... but for right now, I'm just going to see how things go. If, once her obligations have concluded, she's seeking to be as prominent in our lives as before, I'll arrange for her and I to have coffee (perhaps with one of my sisters) to discuss her behaviour and why we are pulling away from her, as well as verbally outline our boundaries going forward. 

I've been told by a few people that she's been discussing things like suicide. She has told these individuals that it's because we (her daughters) are alienating her, and that we all hate and are against her. She's convinced that we have all ""taken a side"" against her; that ""we think she's stupid and no better than the dirt under our feet"", and other similar negative anecdotes. This, in addition to everything else, is one of the major reasons that my husband and I have decided that she will no longer have unsupervised access to our children. She is clearly having mental health issues, in addition to her physical health issues. 

******Note: She hasn't been discussing taking her own life. Canada has a service called MAID [Medical Assistance In Death], and it's for people who are terminally ill. She *claims* that the doctor has offered it to her, ""because of her depression,"" and that she is considering taking it. The thing is, MAID is barely accessible to the people who *actually* need it, and it is -understandably-  very restrictive to access... so I really don't believe that it was ever offered to her. It's illegal for this service to be offered under the basis of mental health issues, and it will remain illegal to being offered for mental health cases *at least* until 2027, when the case for it is allowed to be readmitted into court. 

I do not believe she is at risk of harming herself at this time. 

While, as far as she is concerned, I ""don't know"" about her suicidal discussions, I have, as gently as I could, brought up her mental health in the past (two of these conversations were before anyone had mentioned her suicidal talk to me). Every time we have had a talk about her mental health, I've asked if she is seeing a psychiatrist, or therapist, or at least counseling (even though she needs help above a ""counselor""). Every time I've asked her,  she has been evasive, if not outright hostile about it. I know she *was* doing counseling/therapy sessions, remotely, once a week, but that has since discontinued. She did tell me a few months ago that (""through no fault of her own"") she was kicked out of her counseling sessions for missing too many of them (the program was very strict about missing no more than 3 sessions, and she missed 5 before they booted her). 

So, if anyone has any advice about how to go about explaining why we're going low-contact with her and why we are no longer going to allow unsupervised visits with the kids, then that would be great. I have a feeling that this will be a conversation I'll need to have with her at some point. ",1,1728193959.0,LifeAdvice,1,0.99,False

I came to win, to vibe, to elevate the energy in the room, and you hit us with Frank Ocean? Seriously? I hope your phone charger mysteriously vanishes every time you’re about to plug it into your phone, and that your phone’s always on low battery.

An aux battle is about bringing the heat. It's about crowd control, picking the song that gets everyone on their feet, not making us contemplate life like we're trapped in a rainy art-house film. And then, the fact that people actually voted for you? I’m personally offended. I hope your phone is forever stuck in airplane mode, and that your playlists automatically switch to “shuffle” when you’re trying to set the perfect mood.

I wasn’t just battling you; I was battling the crowd, the voters—the traitors who somehow think Frank Ocean is a valid choice in the middle of an aux battle. I could feel the energy shift the second your shit appeared onto my screen as my competitor. I hope every song you love gets blocked in your country, and that your favorite artists start exclusively releasing music on vinyl—just so you can’t listen to them on your precious streaming service.

There are thousands of tracks to choose from, songs with bass, hype, beats that drop like fire. And you picked Frank Ocean? May your favorite earbuds always be missing the left one, and may every Bluetooth speaker you touch immediately disconnect the moment you press play.

Let’s get one thing straight: no one is questioning the man’s talent. But playing Frank Ocean in an aux battle? That’s like showing up to a sword fight with a spoon. I hope every YouTube video you watch buffers indefinitely, and that your headphones always pick up radio static from an AM station.

What gets me even more is the crowd—the ones who voted for that snooze fest. Y’all had one job. ONE. You heard that mellow vibe and thought, ""Yeah, let’s make this guy win!""? I hope none of your parents ever took you to Disneyland.

Putting Frank Ocean in a high-energy battle is a vibe killer. But voting for it? That’s a whole new level of betrayal. I hope every time you try to connect to a Bluetooth speaker, it auto-connects to your mom’s car stereo instead. May your best playlists always be deleted by accident, and may every lyric you love be misunderstood by everyone else.

And to everyone who clapped along or nodded in approval at the Frank Ocean track, I hope your music apps crash just as you're about to hit the chorus of your favorite song. May your favorite concerts always be on the day you have to work late, and may your headphones constantly slip out of your ears.
Let me make it clear: if you vote for Frank Ocean in an aux battle, you are officially my nemesis. You’re the reason my faith in humanity faltered that day. I hope every time you try to hype up a room, the Wi-Fi crashes, and that your music is always stuck at 10% volume.

If you thought Frank Ocean was the move, you are no longer invited to the Soundmap community. And to the people who voted for that, congratulations—you’ve proven you have the same musical energy as a dimly lit waiting room. May your Spotify Discover Weekly always be filled with songs you hate, and your favorite playlist constantly be invaded by weird, off-tempo remixes.

**ROSE**

Hello, dear listeners! This is Rose Quincy speaking, you’re listening to All Around Us, a podcast which covers all things… out of the ordinary.

**\[SPOOKY MUSIC PLAYS\]**

Today, dear listeners, I have for you a rather unpleasant tale of madness and woe. It’s a bit of a more personal story than our usual fare, as it’s centered on an old college friend of mine, one Katie Franks, née Ellison. Katie grew up well-off, well-loved, and fairly sheltered, though she insisted to me on one occasion that she hadn’t been spoiled. I didn’t really believe her, but it wouldn’t exactly have been polite to call her out on it. She was actually a good friend, though. She really liked to see the best in everyone, she was really the complete opposite of me in that way, but we still got along.

She met her future husband, Vincent Franks, near the start of our senior year. I’ll be honest, I hated the guy. Didn’t really have a good reason for it, something about him just didn’t sit right with me. It felt a bit like, whenever he looked at me, there was this… momentary flash of disgust he was barely able to conceal. She clearly didn’t think the same, though, she was absolutely head over heels. Suffice to say, by the end of the year, they were married, and Katie and I didn’t really talk anymore. Based on the few secondhand accounts I heard, they seemed perfectly happy together.

We still had a few mutual friends, and even occasionally saw each other briefly, at weddings and the like, though we never spoke. At the time, I never really noticed anything was amiss, but in retrospect, I think she looked tired. I looked back over some of her old Facebook photos while writing this, and the difference between the oldest and the newest ones… it’s subtle, but if you knew her back then, it was night and day.

A few weeks ago, she reached out to me, completely out of the blue, for the first time in over a decade. She’d heard about our podcast and said she had something she wanted to tell me in person. Now, frankly I was mostly just surprised she’d heard of the podcast, but I was still a bit concerned. If you’re a regular listener, you know what usually happens when people tell me they’ve heard of the podcast and have something they want to tell me in person. Nothing good. The incident with the spiders comes to mind.

Still, the Katie I knew wouldn’t hurt a fly, very much unlike a spider, and so I figured we’d be safe as long as we met up in a public place. The supernatural doesn’t like to draw too much attention to itself, after all. We agreed on a location to meet, a charming little coffee shop not far from our alma mater, in a busy part of town. I got there substantially earlier than we’d agreed, in order to scope out the area, make sure there weren’t any unpleasant surprises. Katie was already there. She saw me in the crowd and waved me over.

She looked atrocious. Her hair was stringy and clearly hadn’t been washed in days, and her skin had an unhealthy pallor to it, but the worst was her eyes. In every way that I could quantify, they looked just as I remembered them, but when she looked at me I felt an overwhelming sense of anxiety… as if I were being judged and found wanting.

Luckily, I was able to surreptitiously record our conversation. I’d originally intended only to use it as a reference when writing the script, but, in light of what happened, I think it’s better if I just play it in its entirety.

**\[RECORDING BEGINS\]**

**KATIE**

Rose.

**ROSE**

Katie! It’s been so long since we’ve been able to catch up. How’ve you-

**KATIE**

Shut up. I’m tired of your endless fawning over me. It wasn’t cute ten years ago and it’s not cute now.

**ROSE**

I-

**KATIE**

You seriously think I didn’t notice? You have the emotional subtlety of a sledgehammer blasting EDM. That’s not really relevant, though, I’m here because of Vincent. You were right about him. No, not for the reason you thought you were, which, as I recall, was petty jealousy. No, he’s a monster.

**ROSE**

If you’re not safe… If you need a place to stay, my apartment has room, I can sleep on the couch.

**KATIE**

I can take care of myself. Bold of you to use what you, incorrectly, assumed to be a case of domestic violence against me to try to get me into your bed.

**ROSE**

That’s not what I meant.

**KATIE**

*Sure* it isn’t. Do you want to hear my story or not?

**ROSE**

Go on.

**KATIE**

When I met Vincent, I thought he was the kindest, most caring, cleverest person in the world. Cleverer than me, and certainly cleverer than you. When we got married, I think I was the happiest person to ever live. I was so naïve at the time. I thought there was such a thing as a good person, and that he was one of them.

It didn’t take too long after the wedding for him to dispel that notion. It was as if a switch flipped in him. He became… this whole other person, crass and inconsiderate and lazy. He refused to help out with any household chores, he’d berate me for the smallest mistakes… it was a nightmare.

At first, I thought that somehow, the Vincent I loved had been spirited away, replaced with this… thing, and that if I acted just right and did what he wanted I could bring the old Vincent back. And I could, for brief moments, but it never lasted. I realized that no, this was just him, this was who he had always been, and that the man I loved had been nothing more than a charming veneer.

I hated him for it, then. I began having these thoughts, little flickers at first. What if I stabbed him. It wouldn’t be hard, he was an unathletic slob. Over time, the thoughts got more vivid, more detailed. How I’d ambush him, where I’d hide the body, visions of blood leaking out of one, two, a hundred stab wounds. The sob story I’d concoct, about how he’d been acting oddly for a while, talking to me less, and eventually just vanished in the middle of the night.

I never seriously entertained any of it, of course. Really, I was horrified by the thoughts. I didn’t want them, they were horrible and violent and evil, evil things, but if I didn’t think them I’d have lost my mind. It felt like… it felt like I was discovering a new part of myself, an unsavory part, but a part that had always been there, that I just couldn’t deny any longer.

At one point, during one of our arguments, I asked him why he’d lied to me, why he’d pretended to be something he wasn’t, hid the fact that he was a monster. I genuinely didn’t understand, at the time. He explained, very simply, that everyone did it, even me. And, as an example, he used the thoughts I’d been having about dismembering him and feeding the pieces to the local gulls. He sounded as if he were discussing the weather.

I’d never told him those thoughts before. I’d never breathed a word of them to anyone. I didn’t know how he knew, but I was terrified of what would happen if he told anyone else. Especially the police. So, I did the only thing I could think of, and I grabbed a large kitchen knife from the counter and lunged at him.

It turned out he wasn’t quite as much of an unathletic slob as I’d thought. He caught my wrist and disarmed me pretty easily. He twisted my arm to stop me from moving, and looked into my eyes. He was smiling. I saw nothing but contempt in that expression. He looked almost like the Vincent I knew.

“There she is,” he said. And without another word, he released me and walked out the door.

I understood, then. He was right, he’d always been right. Of course he’d been. He was the cleverest person I knew. He was a monster, and so was I, and so are you, and so is every other person on this miserable planet. The rest of you just hide it better.

I still don’t know how he knew my thoughts. That’s the supernatural bit you needed for your podcast or whatever.

**ROSE**

I’m… I’m sorry. I should have- I should have realized, I should have talked to you-

**KATIE**

Yes. You should have. You should have convinced me seeing Vincent was a bad idea, all those years ago. You should have done a lot of things. You didn’t. You don’t need to apologize, though. These failings are in your nature.

**\[RECORDING ENDS\]**

**ROSE**

I- I think we need a cut here, Wy. I shouldn’t have listened to it again. I’m so sorry. I’ll be a moment.

**WYATT**

That’s fine. Just take your time.

**ROSE**

Thanks. I think I’ll be good to go in a few minutes. Just gotta breathe.

**\[LONG PAUSE\]**

Actually, no. Keep recording. I can’t lie anymore.

It’s all real. All of it. This isn’t a joke, it isn’t part of the bit, it’s real. The supernatural is real, and it is growing, there are more and more incidents every year and they are getting less and less subtle. It is about to reach a tipping point and humanity is completely unprepared for whatever that might be because nobody is talking about it.

If this scares you, it should.

**WYATT**

I thought we were planning to wait until-

**ROSE**

I can’t lie about her. I'm sorry. Whatever that was, it wasn’t Katie. It was evil, pure evil, and Katie was good. I don’t know where she is now, if she’s still alive in there, even, but I have to try to find her. I have to bring the old Katie back.",1,1728192686.0,statementbegins,0,1.0,False

I'm not having a major mental health crisis or anything, just... kinda bummed and I'm due to get my period soon (like, tomorrow) so that's having me feel extra emotional.

I've been feeling lonely lately. My brother got married last month - I adore his wife, and all of his friends, but... being at his wedding, with so many of his friends there, kind of highlighted for me how... I couldn't fill a room even a third as big with my own friends. I know I know, don't compare, everyone's different, but I've had a rough time making friends. I don't think it's anything wrong with me - I think I'm just so focused on my career, and also dealing with chronic pain, that I don't spend as much time as I'd like socializing for non-work-purposes. I would like to socialize more. Earlier this year, I *was* socializing more, and I thought I'd maybe found my tribe but I definitely did not so I stopped wanting to go to the places I'd been going regularly. 

I do have a few friends in my city but most of them are ""catch up friends"" who are busy with their own lives and we only ever end up getting dinner or coffee and catching up. Not actually ""doing things"". I'd really, really like to make more friends I can ""do things"" with - I guess I'm just trying to find my tribe. I know the type of things I like to do, and I know the type of activities/events I could do to find like-minded people, I think I'm just... trying to find the actual exact activities/events in my city that I could go to.

I'm also in a lot of pain. I have chronic migraine and also probably thoracic outlet syndrome - which causes pain, weakness, numbness, and tingling in my head, neck, shoulders, arms, and hands. I have a messed up knee too. It seems like everything I try to help one of my health conditions either... doesn't help, or it helps but gives me awful side effects, or it helps at first but then stops helping. I've had a LOT of doctor's appointments lately and I've had to spend a lot of time calling the pharmacy to make sure they have XYZ drug in stock, and it's just... exhausting. Especially because I have no idea if XYZ drug will work at all or if it'll cause me to, IDK, suddenly break out in full-body hives (yes that happened). I have some promising testing coming up but... man, what a headache it's been to even get these appointments made. I hate it so much.

  
Also recently one of my favorite bands announced they're breaking up. To be honest it didn't really come as a surprise at all but I'm super sad about it, not gonna lie. Just a little cherry on top of everything else right now.

I dunno. I don't think my problems are special or unique, I guess I'm posting because I feel kinda sad and could use some support. (Please be gentle, lol.) I'm lonely, and I really want to not be lonely. I also really want to not be in so much pain. Ugh.",0,1728192388.0,AskWomenOver30,0,0.5,False

[Subarachnoid hemorrhage complications? Seriously concerned wife...](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fea3kn/subarachnoid_hemmorage_complications_seriously/) September 11, 2024

My husband was hit by a car while on his ebike 2 weeks ago. No fractures of any sort miraculously, but has a mid-temporal trauma subarachnoid hemorrhage on his right side. He is supremely lucky to be alive, and his 2 day stint in the ICU was filled with onlookers of the man who was crushed in a car but only suffered a minor laceration and brain bleed.

This man is very anti-hospital and finicky and insists he's fine, but his mother and I disagree because he has permanent optical nerve damage due to an extremely rare brain aneurysm (it wasn't an aneurysm, I just don't know what to call it because it doesn't have a name yet...) he had as a child. The doctors said that puts him at even higher risk than if he were ""normal"".

I think he should go back to the ER to get another scan and suck it the frick up, and these symptoms are why:

He is still having high blood pressure spikes (his average has been 160/100, highest spike while sitting was 210/150, heart rate averaged around 60 but he had sinus bradycardia when he was released with a max dip of *39* 3 hours before he left \[possibly due to a med they gave him currently not on the list for some reason...\]), ever since stopping the week prescription of Keppra his headache has now turned into an additional severe toothache that makes his ""brain feel wiggly"", the headache that originally was in the middle right of his brain where the bleed is, has been traveling around, specifically the back section of his brain. He has been sleeping abnormally long (usually it's 4 hours a day, but he's been sleeping 10-14 hours a day some days). His sense of taste has been funky, and some foods are disgusting to him now even though he loved them.

Concerning the toothache, it keeps switching from his tooth to his brain, and it's so bad he's been breaking the rules and taking 1200 mg of Tylenol every 6 hours rather than the capped amount of 650mg, and he says it doesn't help at all. He's also been hammering Oragel into his teeth, literally saying ""It's not helping but it helps"".

Cognitively he's ok, a bit slower than normal but that's kind of to be expected with a head injury. No tingles or numbness passes all sensory tests and reflex tests. His wrist is starting to hurt (he crushed the back of the car with it so I suspect it's got a buckle fracture at least \[I had one as a kid\]).

The main worrying thing is the back of head headache that won't go away, and the fact that he's still getting very dizzy in weird situations. Against my judgment, he hopped onto my bike last week to make sure he can still mentally deal with biking, and he surprisingly has been very good on it, and only has an issue once he stops. He gets super dizzy when staying still and is perfectly fine when moving. When he took a shower last night, he wasn't dizzy at all but became very dizzy as soon as the water was shut off and he stopped moving.

The ICU said the dizziness should've gone away after roughly a week but this is week 2 and it's not getting any better.

Am I wrong for wanting to force him to go back and at least get looked at? In our area, the nearest time to see a basic PCP is a 3 month wait, and my neurologist (only outpatient one in our area) has a 6 month waiting list for new patients.

Also if we do go, how can he convince them to not give him any IVs? His veins and arms are sensitive and *still* bruised from his original stay, and he doesn't want them prodding at him just to do a basic CT scan and wrist X-ray.

Many thanks in advance, sorry for the length, I can provide other info if needed and if y'all wanna see the damage to the lady's car I'm down to put it in the comments but only if there's an actual want for it. Also, this isn't an emergency post, I understand neurological emergency signs (I have neurological issues myself), I just need someone to back my concerns because me and his mother aren't convincing enough apparently.

Edit: just realized I left out personality changes. Usually, he is a generally angry person, but has been unexplainably sad since the accident, crying at the sight of the simplest of things like a crushed water bottle our kittens were playing with. Also, his newest symptom is ""popping and crackling"" in his right ear.

***Relevant Comments***

**Wisegal1**:

>The things you are describing all sound very typical for a traumatic brain injury, which is what he had.

>The headaches, sleeping pattern changes, and personality changes are common. I tell my patients to expect these things to be present for weeks to months after the injury, with slow improvement during that time frame. Also in this category are the cognitive changes.

>...

>The Tylenol use you reported is very concerning. Doses higher than 4000mg in 24 hours can cause liver damage. This isn't the mild type, either. Tylenol overdose can cause irreversible and fatal liver failure. Please don't let him take that much in 24 hours.

>If he has new worsening confusion, weakness on one side of the body, new difficulty walking, difficulty speaking, acutely worsening pain, or you are unable to wake him up, you need to go to the ER immediately. It's rare, but rebleeding in TBI patients does happen.



[WIBTAH if I called out my MIL for literally putting my husband last?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fis8xu/wibtah_if_i_called_out_my_mil_for_literally/) September 17, 2024

\[Accident Recap\] While he has been home recovering, he's been having lots of various symptoms, along with some bottled mental health decline that he *thinks* he's hiding. This man is usually very stoic, calm, and collected, and usually if anything on the angry side, but he has been crying at the drop of a hat, left and right. Even he knows it's odd.

Ever since his accident, I've been in contact with his mom (56?F) keeping her updated as she lives across the country and couldn't be by his side like I and his brother were. This is important because when my husband was a very young child, he had an extremely rare blood clot occur that caused permanent optical nerve damage in one eye, and his mother is the knower of that whole period of his life, as she spent every day with him for a full year in the hospital working to get his sight back. His previous clot made this new bleed very dangerous, so keeping my MIL in the know was/is a MUST.

My BIL only hung around for the first 2 days and then gave up on caring and left (he's an asshole, I'll sum him up shortly), and at some point a week and a half after the accident, my MIL stopped answering texts about the updates entirely. My husband blew it off as his mom thought ""no news is good news"" as a better option, but I found it dickish.

Suddenly last week she texted saying she and her partner were coming to visit this week. When I talked with her sister who lives near her, she said my MIL had been frantically trying to find cheap flights to come see my husband. Said husband got very excited visibly, but then blew it off and said ""Ok, cool"". I knew he'd been missing her, as she only moved away due to some trouble between our families that resolved itself in an odd way (no hard feelings between anybody, just weird living situations). He's also been so emotionally unstable that I think he just needs her around. We've been together for 11 years and he's nowhere near alone, but she's still his mother nonetheless. Plus she's a wonderful woman in many ways, so she's great to have around when you feel like shit.

She didn't tell us a day, so when she texted me this afternoon suddenly saying that she was driving back from her sister's house, would be visiting my BIL, getting a motel, then stopping to say hi, you can say we were both surprised, and both feeling a mixture of happiness but also sadness.

The sadness is because of her choice of people to visit. The airport she landed at is 30 minutes north of where my husband and I live. She decided instead of immediately coming to check on her son who is lucky to be alive, to instead travel 2.5 hours north from the airport, to visit her 3 y/o granddaughter at her sister's house (my BIL and his girlfriend have severe drug issues, so my aunt in law has custody of her for now until they get their shit together). Then she left there to travel 2 hours south back towards us, to visit my BIL, then get a motel in *his* town, THEN maybe come say hi if it's not too late for her.

My husband said this was fine, but I could tell he was upset because he started tearing up. He kept blowing it off, but it made me mad. Then 5 hours later, as I suspected would happen, my MIL called to say that she was tired from driving and her plane trip, and that she was going to go to sleep and see us ""whenever"" tomorrow. My husband quietly broke down, denying his emotions and saying he was fine, he didn't know why he was reacting this way, yadda yadda.

So WIBTAH for telling my MIL *she's* a fucking asshole, made my husband cry, and while I understand she's stressed out herself dealing with my BIL and his bullshit, that she needs to stop putting my husband last to placate the piece of shit she should have aborted? That her firstborn son that she spent so much time and effort taking care of almost died and wants his fucking mother to the point of crying like a baby, and that directly doing everything but coming to see him broke his heart to bits?

The reason I word it that way is because my BIL has a massive 2nd child complex where he thinks my husband is the favorite because he was born first, and due to his childhood medical issues, he used that as ammo to my MIL as to how my husband is her supposed favorite. Note, he's 31 and is still doing this shit. It doesn't help that she's a massive pushover who lets this shit happen in the first place. But she always does what BIL says and bends to his will. Every time she visits, we only see her once for a few hours out of her weeklong stay, because my child of a BIL wants his mommy to himself, and she caves. My husband likes to keep to himself, so he says it's fine, but I can tell he thinks his brother is the favorite and it makes him cringe internally and seethe with.... butthurtery.

I don't know when she's going to be here tomorrow but I really wanna lay into her. My husband says leave it be, she's got a lot on her plate. I called bullshit, she's literally on vacation right now, there's nothing on her plate. She should've come to see him first. Whether she plans on spending a whole day with him tomorrow or whatever, it doesn't matter. She said she missed him and desperately wanted to see him and hug him, but when it came down to it, she'd rather go cuddle with a baby who barely knows her, than travel to a different location entirely to visit that baby's shitty father instead. Then not even show up at all.

I think I'd be in the right by calling her out, but I think I would also be an asshole because she's a usually wonderful woman who has helped us so much throughout the years, is dealing with a stupid manchild and trying to help him get his daughter back which is saintly itself considering he doesn't deserve anyone's help in general. She doesn't deserve someone yelling at her, but I can't just sit here while my sun and stars breaks to pieces. Also since my own mother's death and our previous relationship, I've been a bit touchy on the subject of how mothers and children should treat each other. But I don't want to make my MIL cry just because I'm being a dick.

If anyone can give some advice, that'd be swell. I'd like to be able to say something tomorrow, but I'll wait and see what the Internet says because my echo chamber is too small at home lol. Thank you all and happy scrolling!

Edit: In case anyone wonders why I shit on my BIL so hard it doesn't like my use of the word ""junkie"", well I apologize but my BIL is not a good person from the get go, and drugs do not help. Explaining all the horrible things he has done is its own story itself. Also, the past 4 times she has come to visit is because of BIL asking her to, along with giving him *lots* of money, pay for multiple weeklong trips for him and his little family to visit her (but not to us, no.)  



[AIW for wanting to punch my BIL in the face?](https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1fitifo/aiw_for_wanting_to_punch_my_bil_in_the_face/) September 17, 2024 (2 hours later)

\[Accident Recap\]

Where I'd (Maybe) Be Wrong: My BIL relatively didn't do anything wrong this time *yet*, I don't think he specifically asked her to come to him first or anything, and I believe he's relatively behaving like a human for the time being..... So punching him in the face would be out of the blue and dickheadish. Plus he's been in therapy and ""trying to get his life together so he can get his daughter back"".

Where I'd Be RIGHT: My BIL is walking garbage in stolen shoes. To super sum up him as a person, he's narcissistic, manipulative, has many deeply rooted mental health issues, multiple severe decade long drug PROBLEMS (not just habits), and acts as if you aren't there doing him a favor and kissing his feet (literally), then you must hate him, and he's going to jump off a bridge (he even goes to the bridge and everything, but he's bluffing and has admitted to that). He has gotten me, my husband, and many others arrested and put through ridiculous court ordeals due to my BIL's schemes. He is imo responsible for 2 girls dying due to drug overdoses, has gotten his current girlfriend addicted to drugs as well, and they've both lost their daughter because she overdosed (luckily she survived). I think it's a blessing because she's out of that environment, and away from BIL who is also extremely violent and often hurts his current girlfriend. I have a permanent neurological disorder due to a fight I had with him once where he headbutted me and cracked my skull open.

He also takes advantage of his mother like crazy because she's a saint and can't say no. He's stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from her over his lifetime and constantly claims favoritism towards my husband to get money, cars, plane tickets, free rent, etc., etc. Meanwhile, my husband maybe talks to his mother once a month to say hi, and that's it. His favoritism claim is due to him being the second child who ""wasn't wanted"" (in reality it is the opposite, my husband is an oopsie baby of hippies), because my husband had a childhood medical event that made him ""the family favorite"", and the list goes on and on. This dude still fights over Pokemon cards with my husband. We've had to hide all of his childhood stuff in case my BIL comes over because he WILL start stealing if he's not being watched or things aren't hidden well enough.

Like... Am I wrong for wanting to punch him? I think of all that history of garbage, (and trust me I've had a front row seat to some AWFUL behaviors from this man lower than any creature on this planet) and it makes me want to punch him in the face. Or have a duel or something. But then he's been good recently, been making pretty good progress with therapy according his his girlfriend, has drastically reduced his drug use, and while still up to shenanigans, hasn't been pulling anyone else into them at least...

But then my MIL went to go see his daughter first, and then him afterward, then went and got a motel and went to bed after telling my husband and I fuck off until tomorrow pretty much. So she spent the WHOLE day doing stuff for/with my BIL, when the whole point of her coming to visit supposedly was because of my husband being in a horrific accident that he's lucky to have survived with only a brain bleed, and she wanted to see him and hug him.

I guarantee that only happened because my BIL whined about some sort of shit and she went running to him. She is a wicked pushover because of my BIL threatening to off himself left and right, so all he has to do is slightly hint that he's upset and she runs to placate him. I suspect this because when my husband was in the hospital, you could see the dollar signs jumping from my BILs eyes once he heard there was a brain bleed, but then got angry and left once the hospital said they were sending my husband home and hasn't talked to us since (it's been 3 weeks and he hasn't answered a single text).

What are your thoughts? The punch is metaphorical for the record, if I were to attack him I'd probably get killed, I'm not insane.

[WIBTAH if I called out my MIL for literally putting my husband last? \*UPDATE\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fjqpx6/wibtah_if_i_called_out_my_mil_for_literally/) September 18, 2024

\[Accident Recap\]

Yesterday my husband and I waited all day for my MIL to call when she was going to come over to say hi. I had to text her at 1 pm because I was starting to get pissed off she hasn't said anything yet, and her response led to me punching a wall without thinking. She said that ""they"" (I was assuming she and her partner) were out to lunch with BIL, SIL, and their daughter who they got to have a surprise visitation day. She said after lunch when my niece went home at 3 pm, she would come see us. I was furious, but whatever. My husband was distraught but again playing it off.

Well eventually around 5:30 pm we got a call from my MIL saying she was coming over. Well FINALLY! We made a plan for her to come pick us up so we could get pizza for dinner (we can't drive), and I laid out a whole idea my husband came up with to get some pizza, go see a movie, and maybe go play some pool afterward because that's a past time his mother loves. Well nope, MIL said she needs to return to BILs house, so she'll be picking us up to get pizza, and then we're gonna go see BIL and SIL afterward. Oh. Of. Course.

So we went with that plan for the sake of not starting an argument. When she showed up, she was nice enough to come up to our apartment and say hi to my dad who lives with us, but wanted to leave right away. The only reason we didn't was because my MIL brought her sister (""K""60F) who hasn't lived in the area or even visited for 30 years, but came with MIL TO SEE MY HUSBAND SPECIFICALLY. She sat with my dad asking a bunch of questions, looking through all the hospital paperwork and accident reports, etc. Honestly stuff his mother should've been doing, but wasn't, and was instead just chatting with my dad and trying to scoot everyone out the door.

After a while, we left and got pizza, and MIL took us to BILs place. We spent 2 hours sitting there talking about BIL and how awful his life is (he quit his job because it sucks, his car is broken again, he wants this and that but can't get it because everyone keeps fighting him, yadda yadda). Meanwhile, my husband was getting sicker and sicker looking, and K and I were constantly bugging him to sit or drink something, or even get ready to go to the hospital because he didn't look good at all and he was starting to get confused by stuff. HUGE red flag.

Now here's where everything spiralled. K suggested that maybe we take my husband home at least because he was starting to sway in his seat and she was guessing maybe he was just tired. My SIL though, started freaking out saying we need to call an ambulance. See, my SIL had a severe traumatic brain bleed happen years ago due to.... circumstances... And she is also a SUPER empath. According to her, she could sense something was super wrong and that my husband needed to be seen right away without delay.

Now my husband usually would be refusing viciously at this point. He hates hospitals and especially hates ambulances. But he wasn't saying anything, so I knew something was wrong and started making the call. My MIL and BIL seemed maybe a little worried, but they kept playing it off saying ""Eh he's prolly just tired. He prolly needs to rest"". It wasn't until my husband threw up all over the floor that they got the fucking picture. I sat and handled the phone call while K and my SIL tended to my husband.

Now I don't know what happened because my back was turned when I was on the phone, but the next second, I heard a wicked loud yelp and then the sound of crashing glass. Then LOTS of yelling. According to K, what happened was my SIL went to hold my husband's head as he was starting to go limp so they were transferring him to a laying position, and my SIL ended up taking his head and laying it on her lap because their floor is hardwood and she was afraid he'd hit his head. Totally valid worry and I thank her for it. My stupid BIL didn't like that though, and without thinking about anyone but himself, grabbed my SIL by the hair, picked her up by it (she's tiny so it's very easy), and threw her into their coffee table.

Multiple things happened at once and I can still see it in my mind's eye in slow mo. First, my husband's head had dropped to the ground, and K wasn't close enough to catch him, so he ended up hitting his head. At this point I turned around, and saw SIL in a bloody pile of glass, MIL holding BIL back from trying to attack SIL, while my husband was having a full Grand Mal seizure on the floor beside them about to get stepped on. Panic doesn't even begin to describe the feeling I had.

Even though unfortunately, due to my having epilepsy, I understand and know seizure protocol. I was in a panic noting the time and all that jazz, I didn't even notice the EMTs and police show up. They heard the crash on the phone and assumed to send police as well. The ambulance scooped my husband when his seizure luckily stopped, rushed him to our chosen hospital, and scooped my SIL off with my MIL to go to a separate hospital closer by (the one my husband was brought to is a Level 4 trauma center and is better equipped). K drove behind us in the ambulance because apparently she's acting mother now, which at this point I don't even care about anymore.

So now my shitty BIL is in the police station and has finally been arrested for his actions. Not sure if my SIL will continue with that as this is NOT their first rodeo, nor do I know what will happen with my niece now. My MIL is staying with my SIL so she's not alone, but she should really be swapped with K, and even K thinks so too. I asked K what's been going on with MIL, and why lie and pull such a ruse, and she said she has no idea what's going on, but something does seem strange as this is totally outside of MIL's normal behavior. We don't suspect she's using drugs as she has pretty severe heart problems, but something's definitely up. But that doesn't matter at all to me right now.

I did end up saying something to my MIL over the phone last night. I as calmly as possible just let her know how my husband has been taking her sudden neglect and told her hopefully this is a wake up call to stop putting all her time, care, and attention to a wife beating piece of crap (she's actually his long time girlfriend, but case still stands). Her response was stuttering and then silence. She's supposed to be here in half an hour but now I don't even know if that's gonna be a thing because supposedly BIL is going to be released sometime this morning on bail so I assume she'll run off to be with him instead. SIL said no matter what, she'll walk here if she has to.

Concerning my husband, he was brought straight past the ER, directly to the ICU, after being shoved through a CT scan. They said he had had a rebleed and it had grown 2cm more than it was before, putting a lot more pressure on his brain, hence the seizure. I knew it was a risk but it's awful to watch your universe convulse uncontrollably. I know my husband watches it happen to me constantly, but it's very surreal being on the other end of the situation.

We're currently waiting for any news other than bad news because so far it's been nothing but bad news, and if the bleed doesn't stop they have to fly him to the big city nearby to one of the bigger hospitals to be prepped or surgery. I am freaking the fuck out but know there's nothing I can really do at this point but be here for him and divulge every bit of info anyone might ever need about him. I don't want my husband to die. If he dies I literally won't be able to continue living in this world.

So hopefully he lives, and his mother comes to fucking see him.

Edit: Forgot to mention, MIL originally was only staying in town for 2 days. That second day she was in town was to be our only day with her. The next day she was planning to take BIL and his family to the beach, and then travel up north again for the rest of her stay to be with her other sister. So the ""this trip is to see YOU"" line was as horse shit as I thought it was. Now I don't know what her plans are.



[WIBTAH if I called out my MIL for literally putting my husband last? \*UPDATE 2\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fmp4ps/wibtah_if_i_called_out_my_mil_for_literally/) September 22, 2024

Hello everyone. I wasn't expecting such a turnout of well wishers and concerned readers, and I appreciate everyone's comments of concern, advice, and overall support. It has made the time go by, rather than be at a standstill.

Now for the update, which will hopefully answer some concerns and questions y'all had.

Shortly after my last update, my husband went in for another CT scan and things were looking good. No growth of the bleed whatsoever so he was on a 6 hour watch until his next CT to see if he could be labeled ""stable"" again. He made it 2 hours before having another Grand Mal seizure, luckily only lasting 2 minutes total. They weren't sure whether to give another CT right away due to a possible cluster, so after an hour or so he went off for another CT. They also prepped the helicopter in case it was needed to fly him to the bigger city an hour away so that he could get surgery there, as the hospital we were at wasn't equipped for that.

Turns out that the seizure opened the hole and now the bleed was fucking massive. It had reached 5.3cm and was leaking towards his ventricles. My husband was somehow conscious and his eyes were open, but he definitely was not all there, and could barely speak. He did recognize me though, and he was able to remember and say our special goodbye that we say to each other before they took him off to the helicopter. I wanted to go with him, but they told me it would be better if I could drive because my weight would slow them down and they needed the space. I called bullshit but didn't wanna fight them too much, and left with K as I am not able to drive.

On the way to the city, I called my MIL to see what was going on with SIL and inform them of the situation, as I had directly been ignoring their texts for the most part because I'd been staring at my husband for hours on end. MIL freaked out and said she was already on the road and that she would be on the way to the city as well. She also informed me SIL was with her and would be coming with, who then took the phone to inform me BIL was staying in jail for DV and drug possession, as he had his daily dose of shenanigans in his pocket at the time of his arrest. SIL also let me know that she was fine and that she just needed some stitches around her eyebrow because some glass cut her face.

By the time I got to the hospital in the city, my husband was already in surgery. The plan I guess was to stop the bleeding from the source itself, and try to remove some of the built up blood because it was creating too much pressure on his brain. He had another seizure on the helicopter ride, and the bleed was even bigger, although they either never told me the size, or I didn't even soak that in at that point. But at this point, the only thing that I could do was wait out the surgery and see what would happen next.

I'm no stranger to waiting for close family to hopefully survive awful and life threatening situations and surgeries. It's like a curse that followed me since I was 4. Death follows me like the plague, and other than my husband, I only have my dad left as living family. I prayed Death would take the fucking day off.

My MIL got to the hospital about half an hour after K and I. She was in hysterics, apologizing to me and K, and begging the doctors to let her into the surgery room at first but then acquiescing when told it was too late to see him. I told her she needs to tone it down and she's lucky I've even let her know where he is or what's even going on considering how she's been acting, and I honestly spent a good hour sitting there TEARING into this woman. I loved my MIL and felt so hurt that she left my husband high and dry to cater to a monster. I hated her for using our softer sides against us to drag us to my BILs house and into a living fucking nightmare.

She listened tearfully and ate every word I dished to her. I didn't feel better afterward whatsoever. She was an absolute wreck and I could see it. Years of worry for my husband, dread and regret, sadness, and understanding, she looked very broken and it made me feel so much worse. She's helped us so much for years. She housed us for free while we struggled for work. Fed us with no questions. Gave us rides and support in all times of need. Hell, this woman taught me to crochet which is my favorite thing to do in this world besides my husband (insert quirky laughter here, I'm currently too tired).

So when she responded to me with what she did, I honestly wasn't surprised and a little pissed at myself for not seeing it in the first place, and yelling at her as hard as I did.

My MIL and my SIL have been working for the past year to get my niece adopted by my MIL behind BILs back, along with all of our backs as well because they wanted as few people to know as possible for the safety of my SIL. When my SIL overdosed a year ago, and they lost custody of my niece, I guess when she was taken away there were lots of stipulations to get her back, and while my SIL has gone through recovery and everything beautifully, my BIL was uncompliant and making the process complicated for no reason. He also was completely unresponsive and still is unresponsive to all correspondences and calls from CPS, so did not know of any of the proceedings even though they sent him forms to sign. My MIL had flown them out to give them a vacation to hopefully restart their mentalities so she could get them started on a new path to life and hopefully get my BIL to become compliant, and I guess she made this decision when my BIL responded by stealing her car to roam around the city to find drugs and came back belligerent and abusive.

So all the secrecy of this specific trip was because things were being finalized this week. The paperwork was signed the day of what I will call ""the incident"", and my MIL wanted all of us to get together that night so she could break the news to my BIL and so we could hopefully celebrate. She feels horrible for what happened, and even somehow feels bad that my BIL still doesn't know yet because ""he has the right to since he's her father"". I want to be there when he's told and his brain implodes honestly. I'd die of laughter in the parking lot.

I asked her why she bothered and why not report BIL sooner since she knew what was going on, and she responded that she didn't want to mess up the adoption. I told her that was extremely irresponsible and that SIL was at such a high risk, but SIL assured me that she wouldn't've had it any other way and that things worked out perfectly. Well, other than my husband. She didn't mean that maliciously, she meant it factually. Nobody planned for my husband to decline so badly all of a sudden, which led to my SIL to go into helper mode which made my BIL jealous (according to SIL he suspects she's cheating with my husband), which led to all of the events that unfolded until now so far.

After all their explanations I honestly was just numb. Didn't know what to feel or think. I still kind of don't. I'm horrendously angry at both of them and they both admitted that it doesn't excuse their fault in this, nor is my MIL absolved from her crimes of abandoning her son in his time of need, and they've been saints since to repent, but I don't even know if I can be mad at them anymore. I know that they needed to dance around my BIL, so that's understandable. I just wish they let us know. They didn't because we are usually naturally LC so they didn't see the point in saying anything. Bad excuse, and now my husband gets to suffer for their incompetence. I told my MIL and SIL they're lucky I don't press charges against them, and they agreed that's fair and that they deserve whatever crap comes their way.

8 hours after going in, my husband came out of surgery alive, thank fuck. They supposedly closed the source of the bleed, but there was a lot more blood than was originally realized, and it created a lot of pressure, and I honestly don't care to type out all the medical bullshit they told me, but pretty much due to the scar tissue and permanent damage that was already present on my husband's optical nerves from his childhood clot/aneurysm, the pressure from the bleed created a massive strain on said optical nerves, and with the way things are my husband is blind and will be for the time being until he inflammation from surgery and bleeding is absorbed. Hopefully.

My husband opened his eyes yesterday afternoon, unable to see entirely. He previously had one and a half eyes worth of sight, and now he has none. He only remembers getting pizza and saying goodbye to me. Everything else in between was empty space. He's having a lot of neurological issues so far obviously, and his speech is extremely slurred, but he is alive, cognitive, and has motor function. He remembers me and his mother and remembers our special words and hand hold. He is luckily still my husband so far. This is not his first time being blind, and he is surprisingly ok with it for now at least. He says it's kind of nostalgic in a way.

I didn't want to worry him but he kept asking questions, so I told him everything that had been going on from beginning to end. He fell asleep as I was telling him the story, and when he awoke later when the nurse came in to check on him, he asked for the rest. I know he needs to be resting but my husband is the type of person who needs to KNOW. He is an informational index that needs to constantly be fed and it kills him to not know things and have answers withheld from him.

I am so happy he is alive. MIL is extending her stay and will be staying with me in the city along with SIL, and they're paying for my hotel. K will be leaving in 2 days when the vacation is supposed to be over, as she can't miss work (she has a high security job). We're all waiting for news on BIL, and on the hospital that did the original surgery when my husband was a child, to see if anyone from the team might still possibly be in practice and have some insight as to where to go from here there's a lot of personal things I left out because this case is very rare and has this teaching hospital in a frenzy. My husband's childhood event was a rare situation, so this is something that's never happened before so far from what they told us.

>There was still no need for your MIL to force her injured son to be around BIL. Adopting her grandchild is obviously important, and perhaps the secrecy was necessary, but there was NO need for her to make your husband make that trip. Especially given that she has seen your husband already have a traumatic brain injury in childhood and therefore knows better than most how dangerous they are. She'll have to live with the fact that she almost killed her son, and her excuses don't make up for any of it.

>You, however, are doing an awesome job. Please remember to be kind to yourself. In order to fully support your husband, you have to prioritise taking care of yourself, too. This is going to be a long process so get good habits started now. Eat well, get lots of sleep, and feel no hesitation about keeping any negativity far away or being selfish. Even if that means telling MIL to leave, or letting her stay.

[Little Update](https://www.reddit.com/user/trueevilincarnate/comments/1fqgrox/little_update/) September 27, 2024

Howdy everyone who has found this. I'm using this Reddit as a diary at this point. I love reading the comments and venting the events out to someone other than family, as my husband and I don't have friends as we're both pretty introverted.

Not much to say so far other than my husband is still in the hospital and is still blind. They've contacted some of the old neurologists from his childhood but haven't gotten anywhere with research yet. The bleed hasn't grown but the swelling hasn't gone down much either. His blood pressure has been stable at least.

My MIL had to go home. She was not happy about it but she is planning to move back across the country to stay nearby rather than move my niece to her house as was the original plan before all this. She already has called a realtor to look at a house in the area as well, so she's all in on this I guess. Therefore she needed to go back with her partner (he has been with her the whole time since she returned with SIL from the hospital ) to pack up their stuff and get things settled. I've been keeping her updated, she's been gone for 3 days so far and is due back sometime next week or so. My niece will remain at my aunt in law's house until she returns.

My SIL is staying with me from now on. I haven't been home minus to grab some stuff for my husband, so she's been staying there to help take care of my dad (he's elderly but still mostly independent), and my cats as well. Honestly, she's been an absolute saint. Luckily her job is very flexible so she has been able to take lots of time off for now while she helps, which I severely appreciate. Plus this all keeps her mind off of what's been going on with BIL.

I don't know I've just been working with my husband and the therapists and doctors every day, while also managing everything legally with the lawyers regarding the accident that started all this mess, and all that jazz. It's been oh so fun! I'm fine though, no need to worry about moi. I've been enjoying this time with my husband the best I can. He's still definitely suffering many neurological complications that keep changing day to day, so it's hard to tell what's going to happen next, so we're just taking everything one day at a time.

Oh and BILs first trial was rescheduled, he tried to kill himself in holding when SIL contacted him to let him know what was going on with my husband, so they have him in some sort of mental health evaluation hold for now or something, SIL didn't explain it well and I don't feel like researching right now. He doesn't know about my niece yet either, SIL decided to wait until he's seen someone to talk to first like a therapist. I told her to just get it over with, and she's considering it.

I'll post again if anything happens! Happy doomscrolling!

I did some research and settled on a Gaggia Classic EVO Pro, a Turin SK40 grinder, some basic accessories and a couple backs of Starbucks Espresso roast. A couple weeks into using the Gaggia and my lattes (or flat whites) were coming out pretty good. I got my grind size dialed in for a flow rate of around 1g/second. Shots were rich and syrupee, full of body with good flavor. So good, that I started to notice the Gaggia's shortcomings.

Preinfusion ""hack"" (opening the steam valve with the pump on). Painfully slow steam. Low capacity reservoir. Light weight (moves when you insert/secure the portafilter). I'm not saying the Gaggia is a bad machine, but I felt like 2 weeks in, I was already reaching the ceiling with this model. So I decided that I'd return it and buy something more robust. After some research and a bit of pricing around, I decided to go with an ECM Classika.

With the Classika, I prep'd everything exactly the way I had it on the Gaggia. Same grind setting. Dose of 20.5g in a 22g ISM precision basket. Orbit (geared) WDT. Distribution. Autolevel tamper at 30lb with click feedback. Set my brew temp to 200F. My classica came with flow control valve and pressure gage (at GH) preinstalled.

First shot on the Classika was a gusher. Thin, not very syrupee at all. Crema was there but, Idk. And the shot was fairly bitter. Now I should point out, I'm pulling ristrettos for my milk beverage. I very much like that full body flavor. But I digress. With my Gaggia my puck was fairly dry when I popped it out. Here the puck was flooded. I checked brew pressure and while the Gaggia doesn't have a gauge, the specs say its at 9 bar. WIth the Classika I visually set it to top out at 9 bar using the flow control valve.

1fx96fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1fx96fa/new_hires_rant_long/,New hires rant (long),"Good evening, Reddit. So we have 3 new hires that have been here for about a month now. The last 2 we had didn't work out. The first one was fired for drinking on the job, and the second quit 2 or 3 weeks in.   

Anyway, onto my rant, since no one else will listen. I'm a NA at a hotel that's usually a business travel hotel. We do take in reservations from non business guests, but it's usually for business or sports teams. To start, 2 of them can barely read and write. We have a communication email that is sent out after every shift that recaps their day. What they did, what went down, guest issues etc... Mind you, their primary language is English, and this property is located in the US. The amount of nights I have seen simple spelling mistakes & run-on sentences is astronomical. It's like trying to translate a language you already speak sometimes.   

My breakfast attendant has asked our morning shift multiple times for help on busy days. They usually clap back with ""Well, I don't know what to do"" and just stand at the desk on their phones. One guy had the audacity to say ""That's not in my job description"" and proceeded to ignore them. Like, what?   

Now let's talk about the errors on reservations. Folks, it's every day. The biggest is our CC Auth. How we do it here is, we take one in. Verify all the information is correct. Then, if it's for room & tax only, we split the folio and change the charge routing for this charge to the new one, and the original is used for the guest to insert their card for incidentals. Too many times has the folio not been split and rerouted and the guests card gets charged for everything. Another big one, double charging. I honestly don't know how this one is happening, but it happens. A lot. It's usually caught during the day and fixed. Probably just as simple as not paying attention to what they're doing.   

On to the cleanliness of the hotel. Specifically the lobby. Most nights, trash piled to the rims, tables filthy from BREAKFAST and even dishes from breakfast left in bins meant to be brought to the kitchen and washed. Coffee area is almost never stocked and there's sugar and coffee spills everywhere. I understand some of my responsibility is to clean the lobby and kitchen. But it's almost always a disaster area, and I'm not a janitor. What are they typically doing when I walk in, you may ask? Sitting at the desk on their phone. Makes me want to rip out all of my hair.   

I've brought this to the attention of management several times. All I get is ""We know"" or ""We're working on it"" or ""Don't worry. We're making changes soon"". But dear readers, like I said, it's been at least a month. I feel like I'm alone in this. I have found a hotel nearby that is a competitor to the one I'm at now, and am looking into it. I guess someone who worked here in the past is there now, and it was the one of the best decision they've ever made. Wish me luck there.   

But that's all. I'm sure there's more that is currently clouded by my endless sea of rage. I just wanted to get this off my chest to some strangers. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some cleaning to do.",1,1728191387.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,4,1.0,False

- Not too picky on the sound quality as long as it's decent
- Preferably over-ear headphones, but I'm open to other suggestions
- Bluetooth and ideally with a 3.5mm wired mode, but this is negotiable
- With a mic
- Planning to use these on a Galaxy phone and tablet and a laptop
- Mostly for home use, maybe coffee shops, too

1fx8yha,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDD/comments/1fx8yha/pmdd_ruins_my_massage/,PMDD ruins my massage.,"After a wild and stressful few weeks at work I decided to finally treat myself to a massage. I booked it a week ago and scheduled it for today. I've been looking forward the very needed stress relief and relaxation today was supposed to bring. I woke up and I'm feeling slightly out of it. No biggie, I must still be waking up. I guess I'll start the day off with coffee.

Coffee in hand I'm ready for my massage in a couple of hours. With caffeine consumed I don't feel awake. However,I notice anxiety not so gently poking me in the ribs. No, it can't be hell week. This was supposed to be my day to relax and unwind. Internally I am screaming, ""Of all the days"". I check my calendar to see if the dreaded week is here...it is.

As I'm anxiously awaiting the time. Perhaps the massage will help me relax. As the time ticks away anxiety grows. The disassociation and brainfog roll in. I have the attention span of a ball of lint. I can't reschedule. They're next opening isn't until next month and I've been putting this off.

Thankfully the place is down the street so I drag myself over. I'm pressed,poked,and prodded for 90 minutes.

1fx8x7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1fx8x7c/opinions_on_burned_haystack_dating_method/,Opinions On Burned Haystack Dating Method?,"Opinions On Burned Haystack Dating Method?

I recently came across this Facebook page called Burned Haystack Dating Method and was curious about what it was so I joined. After being a part of the group for only a couple weeks I've realized this seems like a really toxic group and also a really toxic dating method. If you are not familiar with it it is a dating method designed for women and basically it has rules such as:

-Only checking your dating apps twice a day

-Turning off notifications so you only see the messages during your twice a day checkins

-Blocking any guy that mentions something sexual

-Blocking anybody incompaible or low effort

-Not fighting with anybody on sites

-Only dating a man who is willing to ask and plan a first date and messages you first

-Stongly advise against cheap dates like coffee/walking dates


Ok now a few things I sort of agree with, like not spending all your time on the apps and not fighting or arguing wih men, but the rest is very toxic imo. 

-only checking apps twice a day, while fine in theory, these women are super hypocritical and say a man who doesn't respond quickly enough or enough in general is a red flag. So I do not quite understand why if a woman does it its because she is ""high value"" and any man who isn't willing to wait around isn't worth it, but a man not responding enough is a red flag.

-turning off notifications, again same kind of point as the last. They want a man to show effort but are encouraging women to not get notified when someone they matched with messages them, and not even message more than twice a day. How come its a red flag for men but not women? 

-blocking guys that say sexual things, somewhat ok in theory but these women take it too far. A woman posted on the facebook page a screenshot of a guy making a playful and barely sexual joke and she called him out on it and then blocked him. I thought it was funny, some people have a dirty sense of humor, not always a red flag I do not think.

Blocking incompatible or low effort- incompatible ok fine, but low effort? This whole theory is encouraging women to be low effort towards men and have the man do everything so pretty hyporitical if you ask me. It is low effort to only talk to your dating app matches twice a day imo and not be willing to message first or plan a date.

Not fighting with anybody on dating apps- I agree with this cuz it is just a waste of time to do so

Only dating a man who is willing to ask and plan the first date and message you first- again, we want men to make all the effort? Why isn't it a mutual thing to plan a first date? And what is wrong with messaging a guy first sometimes? Also most of the women following this method believe a man should plan and pay for ALL dates anyways, which is so wrong.

No coffee, walking or cheap dates- this one is my biggest piss off of all. If you say anything about this on the facebook page they all call you a ""PickMe Girl"" for allowing low effort men in your life. They say that a man who only takes you on a cheap date is not a high value man and that you deserve one who will invest more. I prefer coffee dates for a first date, small financial investment, you can talk and see if you vibe, but I'm also a minimalist. But these women say it isn't good enough and you are lowering your standards by not making them at least buy you dinner.


So to me, it just seems so entitled and toxic af. They want men to cater to them and make all the effort while they put little to no effort in. Anybody else find this dating method super messed up? Definitely will NOT be putting it into practice lol but I feel like it's shit like this that makes so many women look bad that aren't even like that.",1,1728190376.0,NoStupidQuestions,3,1.0,False

Right off the bat we noticed she had some crazy diarrhea. No other symptoms! Still as playful as can be but on separate occasions has just leaked watery diarrhea everywhere. Over the walls, chairs, people who handle her. Took her to the vet, she was given the dewormer pill and liquid metronidazole for 7 days. We are on day 5 and I picked her up today and so much diarrhea just came out of her all over me. She continued even more in the litter box! I felt so bad! The vet took a stool sample when I took her on Tuesday but I haven’t heard back yet. I’m worried it’s not worms and something else wrong with her. Should I request something else be done? We just changed the food over to hills science kitten and tiki kitten for wet food because to me it looks like the other kibble liquified and just going through her.  When I went about collecting her stool sample, I kept her in a separate room 4 hours before her appointment. I gave her tiki cat kitten food since it just got delivered and so I could collect a sample. Her poop after eating that food was much more solid and I let the vet know that was actually her best poo that I’ve noticed. It still wasn’t normal though. Also, she is not like any other cat I’ve ever owned, her first night she got into cake and will take drinks out of people’s coffee.

Still hurts tho. ,"Almost gonna be 3 weeks since she left because she felt that she doesn't want to get in a relationship anymore, and was still talking with her ex. It still hurts that when I was crying and was trying to save us on the call, she told she can't be there for me anymore, and asked me to cry to someone else. Hurts a lot knowing that she wanted to be with me not because she saw a future, but because she was lonely. 

I recently landed a really well paying job with a really good package (1.5 times of what I actually wanted). In the past 2 weeks, I cried only once for her (today). Maintaining no contact. Started getting myself on dating apps, and getting some dates, but not really ready to date anyone because it was tiring after she left me. 

I have been talking myself out (solo dates) to coffee shops, restaurants, etc. Haven't been partying or drinking since for me happiness is coffee and trips.

Background: I was seeing someone for around 4 months, and she asked me out first. She introduced me to her friends, and it was going great. Suddenly, she decided not to see each other anymore since she's moving to Dallas. I spent almost everyday with her, almost like her BF, and ended up getting my heart broken. 

Turns out she was still speaking with her ex, and recently drunk called and yelled at the guy she cheated on her ex with, saying ""it was his fault for ruining my life"". My fault, for ignoring all the red flags. She told she really changed a lot after that. Apparently, she also cuddled with a guy her friend was seeing a few years back.

I wish I was making all these red flags up, but it was actually what she said to me. Idk why I thought it would be a good idea to ignore not one, not two, BUT all the red flags... 

In the end, I thought she was a human being too, and she deserved a chance to be a better human being. Well, turns out, some people never change, and will be bad human beings. ",2,1728189191.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

Realistically speaking, we aren't going to come across someone and immediately know that they are the one for us, most of us aren't going to lock eyes with someone across the room and fall madly in love with each other. Knowing someone takes time and effort from both parties.

I'll go first, essentially looks and vibes don't work for me. I am always attracted to just about anyone, everyone to me is attractive in some sense. For vibes, I always end up dominating it, my presence as a person is something people deal with, not me dealing with others. I am in my own world, you step into mine when you hang out with me. 

At this point, the only thing I care is what is my partner's lifestyle. They essentially needs to have a lifestyle that can co-exist and synergise with mine. From simple things like how I like to spend my weekends anywhere from clubbing out till 5 am or cooking brunch and drinking speciality coffee, willing to spend time together in the kitchen and also wanting a kitchen equipped more like a industrial kitchen than a home kitchen, and all the way to be willing travelling like a broke vagabond or at least let me do it.

The thing is that I will accomplish all of this regardless, and I'm not going to change or adopt a different lifestyle just to be in a relationship. They have to be interested in my lifestyle.",4,1728189102.0,sgdatingscene,5,0.83,False

1fx8jwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1fx8jwz/weight_loss_scams_on_tiktok_separating_fact_from/,Weight Loss Scams on TikTok: Separating Fact from Fiction,"In the age of social media, TikTok has become a breeding ground for health and wellness trends, particularly those related to weight loss. While some of these trends may seem appealing, it's crucial to approach them with caution and skepticism. Dr. Jennifer Schriever from Sanford Weight Management Center, in his podcast sheds light on popular TikTok trends and offers expert advice on navigating the world of online weight loss information.

**The Dangers of Online Nutrition Trends**

Many TikTok trends promise quick and easy weight loss solutions, but they often come with hidden risks. Dr. Schriever warns that [**some of these trends can be harmful**](https://news.sanfordhealth.org/podcast/ep-20-tiktok-nutrition-trends-whats-safe-versus-a-scam/)**,** especially for individuals with pre-existing health conditions or those taking certain medications. 

Moreover, many of these trending products and methods lack proper scientific backing, making their safety and efficacy questionable.

**Red Flags to Watch Out For**

When evaluating weight loss advice on TikTok, it's essential to look for red flags that may indicate a scam or potentially dangerous trend. Be wary of:

1. Promises of rapid weight loss
2. Claims of ""best-kept secrets"" or miracle solutions
3. Endorsements from celebrities or influencers without proper credentials. Sometimes there are NOT even real endorsement from any celebrities (like the fake claims that Keto gummies are recommended by [**Oprah**](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1f0detn/for_those_searching_for_oprah_weight_lossketo/) **or** [**Kelly Clarkson**](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1awbdt0/has_anyone_experienced_real_weight_loss_results/) ) but scammers pretend that here are and enforce it by using fake AI videos or other tactics. 
4. Lack of scientific evidence or studies
5. Products or methods that seem too good to be true

# Popular TikTok Trends Debunked

**Powdered Greens**

While powdered greens may contain beneficial vitamins, they often lack the fiber found in whole fruits and vegetables. Dr. Schriever advises sticking to actual produce for optimal nutrition and cautions that some powdered greens may contain contaminants or interact with certain medications.

**Tongue Scraping**

Although tongue scraping may have some benefits for oral hygiene, it's not a significant factor in weight management. Dr. Schriever emphasizes that good overall dental care is more important for preventing inflammation and related health issues.

**Bone Broth**

While bone broth can be a source of protein and help with feeling full, it's not a miracle weight loss solution. Dr. Schriever notes that homemade bone broth is generally safe but advises being mindful of expiration dates and proper food safety practices.

**Dry Scooping**

This dangerous trend involves consuming pre-workout powder without mixing it with water. Dr. Schriever strongly advises against this practice, as it can lead to choking, lung infections, and potentially dangerous spikes in heart rate due to rapid caffeine absorption.

**Internal Shower Drinks**

These drinks, often made with chia seeds and water, are touted as colon cleansers. However, Dr. Schriever warns that consuming large amounts of chia seeds can lead to intestinal blockages due to their water-absorbing properties.

**Liquid Chlorophyll/Chlorophyll water for detox**

Despite claims of various health benefits, there's no solid evidence supporting the use of liquid chlorophyll for weight loss or overall health improvement. Dr. Schriever suggests getting chlorophyll naturally through leafy greens and vegetables instead. There’s no scientific evidence supporting the idea that adding chlorophyll to water enhances detoxification, and the best approach is maintaining a healthy diet rich in antioxidants and staying hydrated.

**Watertok (Flavored Water Enhancers)**

The Watertok trend involves using flavored water enhancers to make water more appealing, often adding sugar-free syrups and powders to boost flavor. While staying hydrated is crucial for health, experts point out that many of these additives contain artificial sweeteners and chemicals that may have long-term health risks. These enhancers can also promote a preference for sweet tastes, making it harder to enjoy plain water or reduce sugar cravings naturally. Drinking plain water or infusing it with natural fruits is a healthier option.

**Cloud Bread**

This viral TikTok trend claims to be a low-carb, high-protein alternative to traditional bread, made from egg whites, cream of tartar, and a sweetener. While it can be a fun, low-calorie snack, it lacks important nutrients like fiber and whole grains that are crucial for maintaining digestive health. It's not a suitable long-term bread replacement if you're aiming for a balanced diet.

**Lemon Coffee for Weight Loss**

A popular TikTok trend suggests adding lemon to your coffee to promote weight loss. However, experts debunk this claim, stating that while coffee may have some metabolism-boosting effects, adding lemon offers no proven fat-burning benefits.

**Nature’s Cereal**

This trend involves eating a bowl of fresh fruits (like berries and pomegranate seeds) with coconut water as a “cereal replacement.” While this option is full of natural vitamins and hydration, it’s not a magical health hack or a substitute for a balanced meal. It’s a great snack but lacks the protein and fiber needed for sustained energy.

**Chlorophyll Water for Skin Health**

Drinking water with added liquid chlorophyll gained popularity for claims of improving skin health and reducing acne. Experts point out that while chlorophyll in plants may have antioxidant properties, there’s no solid research proving that liquid chlorophyll has these effects when consumed. A better strategy for skin health is maintaining hydration, a balanced diet, and proper skincare.

**The Importance of Credible Sources**

When seeking weight loss advice online, it's crucial to verify the credibility of the information source. Look for:

1. Credentials of the person providing advice (e.g., registered dietitian, licensed nutritionist, or medical doctor)
2. Information backed by reputable organizations or health systems
3. Multiple sources confirming the same information
4. Peer-reviewed scientific studies supporting the claims

**A Holistic Approach to Weight Management**

Instead of falling for quick-fix solutions, Dr. Schriever advocates for a comprehensive approach to weight management. This includes:

1. Personalized nutrition guidance
2. Appropriate physical activity
3. Addressing behavioral and emotional factors
4. Medical interventions when necessary

She emphasizes that obesity is a chronic disease and that sustainable weight loss requires long-term lifestyle changes rather than short-term fixes.

**Key points addressed in the** [**SanFord Health podcast**](https://news.sanfordhealth.org/podcast/ep-20-tiktok-nutrition-trends-whats-safe-versus-a-scam/)**:**

1fx8jjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingApps/comments/1fx8jjm/opinions_on_burned_haystack_dating_method/,Opinions On Burned Haystack Dating Method?,"I recently came across this Facebook page called Burned Haystack Dating Method and was curious about what it was so I joined. After being a part of the group for only a couple weeks I've realized this seems like a really toxic group and also a really toxic dating method. If you are not familiar with it it is a dating method designed for women and basically it has rules such as:

-Only checking your dating apps twice a day

-Turning off notifications so you only see the messages during your twice a day checkins

-Blocking any guy that mentions something sexual

-Blocking anybody incompaible or low effort

-Not fighting with anybody on sites

-Only dating a man who is willing to ask and plan a first date and messages you first

-Stongly adivse against cheap dates like coffee/walking dates


Ok now a few things I sort of agree with, like not spending all your time on the apps and not fighting or arguing wih men, but the rest is very toxic imo. 

-only checking apps twice a day, while fine in theory, these women are super hypocritical and say a man who doesn't respond quickly enough or enough in general is a red flag. So I do not quite understand why if a woman does it its because she is ""high value"" and any man who isn't willing to wait around isn't worth it, but a man not responding enough is a red flag.

-turning off notifications, again same kind of point as the last. They want a man to show effort but are encouraging women to not get notified when someone they matched with messages them, and not even message more than twice a day. How come its a red flag for men but not women? 

-blocking guys that say sexual things, somewhat ok in theory but these women take it too far. A woman posted on the facebook page a screenshot of a guy making a playful and barely sexual joke and she called him out on it and then blocked him. I thought it was funny, some people have a dirty sense of humor, not always a red flag I do not think.

Blocking incompatible or low effort- incompatible ok fine, but low effort? This whole theory is encouraging women to be low effort towards men and have the man do everything so pretty hyporitical if you ask me. It is low effort to only talk to your dating app matches twice a day imo and not be willing to message first or plan a date.

Not fighting with anybody on dating apps- I agree with this cuz it is just a waste of time to do so

Only dating a man who is willing to ask and plan the first date and message you first- again, we want men to make all the effort? Why isn't it a mutual thing to plan a first date? And what is wrong with messaging a guy first sometimes? Also most of the women following this method believe a man should plan and pay for ALL dates anyways, which is so wrong.

No coffee, walking or cheap dates- this one is my biggest piss off of all. If you say anything about this on the facebook page they all call you a ""PickMe Girl"" for allowing low effort men in your life. They say that a man who only takes you on a cheap date is not a high value man and that you deserve one who will invest more. I prefer coffee dates for a first date, small financial investment, you can talk and see if you vibe, but I'm also a minimalist. But these women say it isn't good enough and you are lowering your standards by not making them at least buy you dinner.


So to me, it just seems so entitled and toxic af. They want men to cater to them and make all the effort while they put little to no effort in. Anybody else find this dating method super messed up? Definitely will NOT be putting it into practice lol but I feel like it's shit like this that makes so many women look bad.",0,1728188913.0,DatingApps,2,0.5,False
