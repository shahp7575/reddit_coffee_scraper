I recently moved into a studio condo unit. I am trying to lock down the furniture layout before I rush and buy furniture for the living space. I currently have a queen size bed that perfectly fits in the nook area to the left as soon as you walk into the unit. I am planning on buying a sofa (preferably a small sectional sofa bed incase my family visits), a TV console, a small coffee table, a work desk + office chair (I work from home about 3-4 times a week) and maybe also a shoe storage cabinet at the entry way between the w/d and the bathroom. Could you guys please suggest some layouts that are functional with a great use of space :) I have the layout added as well. Also, if you could suggest any sectional sofas that would fit the space would be awesome.

1kse5j2,https://www.reddit.com/r/75HARD/comments/1kse5j2/failed_on_day_30/,Failed on day 30,"So I think my diet goal shot me in the foot. My set up has been wake up 8am - read 10 pages - then get up have a coffee and then do a walk or a jog outside for 45 mins. Get home after the workout have breakfast and then get ready for work and take my progress photo. I'm a restaurant owner and the chef so mainly in the kitchen but do a bar or floor shift once a week, fully hands on owner so only get about an hour of seated work a day the rest is on my feet. My week is made up of one 6-7 hour workday.  Two 10 hour shifts then the last two of the week I do 12-14 hour shifts with an hour break in the middle. With the extra walking in the morning I've been hitting between 20k-30k steps during the day. Have lunch during work then when i get home generally do a weight session after work and on the two big work days just an extra walk. Then have dinner. And go to sleep around 1230-1am. Water has been challenging but got used to it and made sure I got it all down before 7pm so bathroom trips didn't affect sleep. Have stuck to my diet and not had any cheat meals or alcohol (if forced to do tasting at work always spat it out). So, I set my diet goal to be 2400cals a day which is what my calculations had said my maintenance calories would be. This was a massive mistake. I've been losing about 1-1.3kg per week. Over the last week I could feel my body not recovering from my days. About 3 days ago was the most pathetic workout of my life I grabbed two 2kg dumbbells and alternated between curls, extensions and shoulder Press for 45minutes while I sat down and watched YouTube. It's all I had in me. I don't consider this failing but it was definitely dancing on the edge. Well I did fail last night only did like 9 sets of exercises before I just sat down and stopped at about 25minutes in. And then this morning I didn't have the energy to hold my book up for the required time to get 10 pages. I'm exhausted. More exhausted than I've ever been and I've worked harder than this. 80hour weeks for months with no days off to get restaurants open has never had me not being able to read a book at 9am. I never restricted my calories when doing that work in any way though, I think when I try this again I will set a more realistic diet goal of just eating no processed or fried food maybe. Interested in what anyone has to say about my post or any insights they may have.",1,1747875406.0,75HARD,0,1.0,False

December 13, 1999

I'm writing this for whoever reads it and as a warning. Several months have passed since everything happened, and I don't know how much longer I can keep hiding from what I created. Everything I did to create a flawless and perfect experiment ended up as a bloodthirsty monster with a ferocious appetite. I can no longer carry this burden...

My name is Edwin Keller. I worked in one of the most influential and renowned laboratories back in the 1950s. I started working as a scientist at 18. I was always a very meticulous and calculating man with my discoveries and analyses—well, that was before. Several months ago, I was fired after being caught tampering with a vial containing an unidentified black liquid that was under analysis. After more than 49 years of experience, they fired me over a single mistake.

After that, I fell into alcohol, started having severe anxiety attacks, and was on the verge of a mental breakdown. Science had been my passion since I was 4 years old—it was my escape, my purpose. Back then, I couldn’t tell reality from fiction. Everything was distorted and blurry.

One night, while sitting in my room, drowning in thought, I had a brilliant idea. I grabbed my kit where I kept my tools and took out a small vial of black liquid. I didn’t know exactly what it was, but I decided it was time to try something new—create a new and unforgettable experiment. Something never seen before. With this experiment, they would have no choice but to rehire me.

That was the worst mistake of my life.

From that very day, I began preparations. After about two months, everything was nearly perfect. Everything was ready—except for one thing: a volunteer. That would not be an easy task. After my dismissal, newspapers and television had broadcasted everything—my name, my face, my data. Absolutely everything. It was clear that finding someone wouldn’t be easy.

If I had to use brute force... I would, at all costs.

I came up with a plan to avoid being discovered. I covered my face to remain unrecognizable and decided to sell fruit and juices in front of my house. At first, almost no one came, but everything takes time. After a few days, people started showing up. I was doing well. I had plenty of options, but honestly, none of them convinced me. I needed someone with the essence, the capacity to be the right subject.

A week went by, then almost half a month. I still hadn’t found the right one. I was getting irritated, frustrated. I had high hopes, but none of the people that came matched what I was looking for. That Thursday night, in August, around 10 PM, I was just about to pack up and go back inside, completely stressed and out of patience.

And then I saw him.

A masculine silhouette sitting on an old, rusted bench. I carefully stepped out to get a better look.

He was a tall, somewhat thin man, maybe in his 20s or 30s. He had dark brown eyes with heavy bags under them, and messy black hair. His skin was pale, and his formal clothes looked worn and outdated. He looked exhausted and gave off an eerie, uncomfortable vibe. What stood out the most was how lifeless his eyes looked. It was like there was no soul inside him.

Right then and there, I knew—he was the one. He had what I needed. He was perfect.

I approached him carefully with an apple juice I had laced with sedatives and greeted him politely. He barely lifted his head, and when he did, his cold and indifferent stare met mine.

“Why should I drink this juice?” he asked with a deep, rough voice, full of neutral coldness.

“Because it’s full of vitamins, young man. Believe me. A man like me knows what’s good and what’s not. Besides, you look tired, son. A little juice wouldn’t hurt,” I replied with an innocent, kind tone.

After several minutes of silence and night sounds, he finally took the juice and drank it calmly.

Perfect. It was easy to trick him. Now I just had to wait for the sedative to kick in.

A couple of minutes later, he got up and started to walk away. I pretended to return to my house, but instead I watched him from the window. Soon, he collapsed on the ground—unconscious. The sedative had worked.

I quickly grabbed my lab kit and opened the basement where I would conduct the experiment. I dragged the man inside, chained his hands and feet, and blindfolded him with an old cloth.

While he was still unconscious, I prepared a syringe and extracted the black liquid from the vial. I injected it into his mouth, the black substance slowly descending. Then I administered other injections to his neck and arms with different chemicals. Once I was done, I locked the basement and walked away.

Days passed. At first, I could hear the chains rattling violently. But after the first month… silence.

The worst part? I never checked on him. I had no idea how the experiment was evolving...


---

Three Months Later
November 10

Three months had passed. The experiment should have been complete by now. I placed flyers around town announcing my discovery and creation and even sent a letter to the lab.

That same night, all my former colleagues, bosses, and even members from other labs came to witness the experiment. My former boss, Cristian, said they might rehire me depending on what I presented. I assured him it would be the greatest thing he had ever seen.

There was laughter, excitement, anticipation. Everyone was curious. I said it would be a surprise.

It was 7:30 PM. Everything was going well. I was in the kitchen having a coffee when Richard, a close colleague of mine, asked where the bathroom was. I directed him to the end of the hallway.

By 8:00 PM, it was time. Everyone was waiting eagerly. I told them we had to wait for Richard, and they agreed.

But 40 minutes passed. No Richard.

People began asking why he was taking so long. I found it odd. I checked the bathroom—door half open, lights off. He wasn’t there.

Something felt wrong. Nervous and trembling, I walked to the other hallway—towards the basement. The door... was open.

I panicked.

I descended the stairs with a lantern, trembling so hard I nearly fell. At the bottom step, I saw a huge black stain, nearly identical to the liquid I had used.

Then I saw the trail of blood.

My breathing quickened. I followed the blood, and around the corner—I found Richard.

He was dead.

Part of his face had been bitten off, one arm was lying on the floor, a hand was missing, and his intestines were completely gone. Just a hollow cavity remained. I vomited.

And then it hit me. The subject.

I turned toward where he had been chained. He was gone. The chains were loose. How did he escape?

Then I realized—I had left the keys by the basement door.

Terrified, I rushed up the stairs. As I reached the hallway, I saw him.

But... he wasn’t human anymore.

He looked taller. His pale skin was now almost white. His hands and feet were deformed, black, clawed, his nails soaked in blood. His hair now covered his face, and his mouth—dripping with blood—revealed razor-sharp teeth.

In one hand, he held Richard’s entrails.

Without hesitation, he devoured part of them savagely. His stance was animalistic, hunched, and monstrous. His breathing was rapid, and he growled like a demon.

Three months without food or water had awakened an insatiable hunger.

I couldn’t move.

The creature bolted toward the others. I tried to follow, but it threw a small table at me with inhuman strength. It hit my head.

Darkness.

When I awoke, dizzy and in pain, everything was wrecked. Furniture overturned, blood splattered everywhere.

I grabbed my lantern and stumbled to the living room.

What I saw froze my blood.

Bodies.

Everywhere.

Some mutilated, some missing limbs. Faces torn apart, eyes, tongues, and noses gone. Exposed muscle and bones. All of them… missing their entrails.

I vomited again. It was a massacre.

As I moved through the house, I saw even more corpses. Then, outside...

He was there.

Now wearing a formal and elegant black suit and hat. When he sensed my presence, he turned toward me. No longer monstrous, but something else. Something wrong.

For several minutes—he just stood there. Silent.

Then slowly, he raised his hand and brushed the hair from his face.

And I saw them—his eyes.

Those… were not human eyes.

We stared at each other for what felt like hours. Then he let his hair fall back into place—and vanished into the night.

That image is burned into my mind.

Later, I went to the police. I lied. Told them a wild animal had attacked us. They believed me. They interrogated me, but I was released.

If I had told them the truth—I’d be in prison for the rest of my life.


Subject/Experiment 199

I don’t know what that sick bastard turned me into. I have no father or mother—just lived in an old house with my grandmother and my 10 siblings in a small town. Different fathers, maybe the same one, who knows. Our life was far from easy. We barely had anything to eat. I’m one of the three oldest.

I still remember school... What a waste of time. That place was more like a gang hideout or an alley than a school. Drugs, fights, alcohol, cigarettes, unwanted pregnancies, people screwing in every corner... Disgusting.

At home, there was only silence. I didn’t talk to anyone. Sure, sometimes they talked to me, but I never tried to talk back. Well... except with Clarabelle—the youngest and the only girl among us. She was very attached to me.

I still remember when I left home and how she cried, begging me:

“Big brother!! Please don’t go!!”
She screamed, almost out of breath. She was only 11 at the time.

When I arrived in town, it was nothing out of the ordinary. At least, not until that bastard showed up and turned me into... this.

I’m only 37 years old. He didn’t feed me. Didn’t give me water. But during the time I was locked up... I developed an insatiable hunger for human flesh—especially for intestines.

During that time, I noticed I could control some kind of black liquid. That’s how I managed to free myself from those chains.

All I know now is that I’ve lost the sanity to stop this hunger inside me. No kind of animal meat satisfies me—only human meat does...

And I won’t just sit and do nothing...

I’m going to kill that damned old man.


---

December 13

I can’t take it anymore.

...I’ve been hearing voices. I’ve had nightmares. And this damn feeling of broken bones…

He’s coming for me. He’s already killed most of the town...

I have no hope left. That thing is starving and won’t stop until it gets to me...

I’m writing this so that you—whoever’s reading this—can be warned...

Be careful with that man...

Well... I don’t even know if it’s a man anymore...

All I know is—I feel a presence watching me through that window...

I’m hiding in my room. I’m scared and shaking...

So please... I beg you...

Don’t make the same mistake I did.

I created a monster thirsty for blood and human flesh...

Please, whoever is reading this...

Wha...

What is this black liquid covering my shoe...?

And the window... it wasn’t open...

I know it’s weird to open with that, but I need you to believe me before the media sinks its claws in.

Because the second you see my face splashed across TikTok or my life dissected on some true crime podcast, you’ll stop thinking clearly. You’ll stop trusting that I didn’t kill Denise.

For Christ’s sake, she was a guest in my house.

Yes, she died there. And yes, I barely knew her or even liked her that much. But come on… why would I murder someone *in my own home*? That’s insane.

Denise was new in town, and I only invited her to my Wine Wednesday party because my husband insisted. “It’s not a good look if you invite all the other moms from our son's class and leave her out,” he said.

So, reluctantly, I asked her right at the school gate while picking up my kid. Her face lit up when I did, and I actually felt sorry for her. 

Ever since she moved in with her son, people had been whispering. You know how small towns are. No place for a single mom, especially not one as pretty as Denise.

The other moms hated how she looked. Her curves, her hair, her eyes… they couldn’t stand it. Not me, though. I didn’t care. 

But Tanya, my friend, told me her husband had been chatting with Denise, smiling too wide, offering to help her with her car or whatever. Thank God Thomas, my husband, would never do something like that. 

Anyway, I’m getting off track. Let me tell you what happened that night. At least what I remember.

\*\*\* 

She showed up around six with a nice bottle of Italian wine. The other women welcomed her just fine, and it looked like her shot of being accepted. 

That night was girls-only. “No men allowed” was our only rule, and it was supposed to be when we moms could drink, chat, and dance freely.

Thomas usually hated it. He’d normally just leave to meet friends at the bar, but that time he just locked himself in the bedroom. 

Denise was lively and charming there. Quick with the jokes, generous with the wine. For a moment, I thought she might actually click with the group.

And honestly, it really hit me how beautiful she was at the party, especially when I remember what her cold *body* looked like laid in the garden the next morning.

It was so...

Never mind. Let’s keep going.

\*\*\*

So, yeah. Some of the girls got a little too excited during the party, including Denise. Drinking way too much, dancing like teenagers, begging me to put on more upbeat music.

The mood shifted after the alcohol kicked in. It became a different party, one I didn't enjoy as much.

But what really set me off was when I came back from the bathroom and saw Thomas downstairs, helping the girls with their drinks.

The way he handled Denise’s glass made my stomach turn. So delicate. So careful. Like it was some kind of ritual.

I hated it.

He saw me watching and went straight back upstairs. “I was just thirsty,” he whispered. “I won’t come down again.”

And he didn’t, but the party was already ruined for me.

I slumped on the couch next to Tanya and watched Denise and the others dancing to whatever 90s pop song was on.

That’s when I noticed Denise starting to fade. 

It happened fast. Too fast. Her eyes started fluttering mid-song, like she was struggling to focus. Then she stumbled onto the floor, dizzy.

We brought her water and tried to keep her upright. She looked wasted, even though I swear I hadn’t seen her drink nearly enough to justify that.

When Thomas heard the commotion he came back down. “We should let her rest in the guest room,” he advised.

I didn’t love the idea, but what choice did I have? Better that she rest and go home later in one piece.

So we took her to the room, laid her on the bed, turned off the lights, closed the door, and got back to cleaning up the mess from the party.

That was the last time I saw Denise alive.

\*\*\*

I definitely didn’t hear what the neighbors claim they did that night.

No struggle. No scream. Nothing.

I just woke up early, went to the kitchen to make some coffee, and saw her through the window lying there in our yard, near the garden. Thomas was already downstairs, calling 911. His eyes were wide, red, panicked. He told me he’d seen Denise kill herself.

But no one in town really believed him. Her body showed clear signs of a struggle.

Her nails were broken, she had a deep slash on her wrist, and a blade in one hand, the alleged cause of death.

Thomas said that’s how she did it, and he saw it happen. But the police report didn’t prove him right or wrong. In fact, it proved nothing.

The neighborhood started muttering about how the police chief, Thomas’s childhood friend, might have looked the other way.

And so, they came up with their own crazy theories of what happened.

The first one?

*That I’d done it*. Tanya, that two-faced bitch, started telling people I’d been glaring at Denise the whole night. That I killed her out of jealousy because of the way Thomas looked at her.

You can still find Reddit threads out there defending that lunatic version.

The second theory? That’s the one the media ran with:

*that Thomas had done it.*

That he drugged her drink, the careful glass he handed her, and tried something that night.

She resisted. He panicked and killed her somehow, then made it look like a suicide before calling his buddy in the police department to help cover it up.

I don’t talk about that theory much. It still hurts, especially after what happened to Thomas the week after.

He shot himself in our garage. I found him there in the morning, lying in a pool of blood.

Some say it was guilt over what he’d done, but I’m not sure. Thomas was never one for guilt.

\*\*\*

So yeah, it’s hard for me to keep repeating myself. But I need to say it again, just so it’s clear.

Stop asking me if I killed Denise.

I did not kill her. I swear on it. I didn’t do it.

I promise you.

Just...

Just never ask me the same about Thomas.",1,1747875351.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

And I came up with a quick recipe, thought I’d share it. 

You’ll need: 

a normal ceramic coffee cup. 

Heavy whipping cream- I use Kroger brand.

One of either of these Nescafé Gold espresso - blonde is mild, intense is well, intense. 

And some sugar.  Also, a second microwavable cup for hot water. 

I start by taking the coffee cup, adding about an inch of the heavy cream. And microwaving it. 
After the first 25 seconds or so, you’ll need to be stopping it to prevent it from boiling over. Happens fast af. 
I usually go for a minute, stopping it briefly every few seconds after the first time it boils up. 

Once it’s good and hot, go ahead and add the sugar and espresso mix. I do 2 teaspoons of each. 
You’ll need to stir the espresso immediately or it’ll turn into a weird glob.  While you do that, go ahead and start the water cup for another min, just enough to get hot. 
Once the heavy cream and coffee is mixed, add water, stir some more and enjoy. 

It’s coffee shop quality delicious. Everything can be kept in the truck, awesome coffee everywhere you go with no need for a maker.  


Of course, if you perfer harsh black coffee, I’m sure it’s good with just hot water and espresso. But idk. I have taste buds.

Im getting into making homemade syrups and sauces for my home café. This would include syrups (sugar and water base) and sauces (milk based - likely condensed milk). 

Ive done some reading and found citric acid paired with sodium benzoate is common.

  
For anyone who has experience:  
1. What preservatives do you recommend I use?

2. How do you actually use them & how much is used?

  
Keep in mind I'm doing syrups and sauces

1kse1w1,https://i.redd.it/oww6k2v0e82f1.jpeg,The face of the company before Fredbear.,"Recently, steel wool posted an “MCM archive” video. It was a 70s commercial advertising a Murray made coffee machine. (Which likely may have contained mimic1) the ideas and possibilities presented in the short video are already cool to think of. Some people, mainly on twitter. Compared the coffee machine to the coffee machine from desolate hope. One of Scott’s previous games before the creation of five nights at Freddy’s. If the referencing of older Scott media continues in anyway I see this idea as a bit more possible. That idea being that Freddy wasn’t always the main face of the company, in fact it was a beaver. This would not only obviously reference chipper & sons leading to the creation of fnaf, but it would make sense with the blue suit in the silver eyes. In that novel, William mentions that the blue suit that he stuffed Carlton into was one of Henry’s older creations. In the graphic novel this character is depicted as a beaver looking creature, and while the graphic novels are not reliable nor canon. I could see it become canonized like William design in Itp. How it would function would be similar to the story of Oswald the lucky rabbit. Henry makes a basic blue beaver character, it gets copyrighted, he makes a yellow bear character as a replacement, names it freddy fazbear and names his new company after it, and the rest is history. Do I believe in this? No. Is it likely? Possibly, it’d be cool. But at the very least it’s a cool idea that has some reasoning toward it being a possibility. I also made a sculpt of a possible design for this beaver if he exist, alright goodbye.",2,1747875089.0,fnaftheories,0,1.0,False

Imagine waking up, brewing your morning coffee, and having your AI assistant remind you of the weather, your grocery list, and the fact that it knows you better than your therapy journal. While we're not quite at the point where robots are doing yoga with us at dawn, AI's influence is palpably sneaking into our daily to-do lists.

**Welcome to AI's Quiet Revolution**

It’s not with a bang but with whispers that AI is embedding itself into the backdrop of our lives. From education tweaks to major life decisions, AI offers the allure of ease wrapped in algorithms. But as Kashmir Hill, the New York Times reporter, sheds light, this quiet march could redefine our perceptions of privacy and community ties. Hold onto your digital hat—your future might just be automated by your favorite app.

**The Education Edge**

Schools are already experimenting with AI to personalize learning. Whether it's crafting bespoke tutoring sessions or forecasting student struggles before they're out of the academic gate, AI is the teacher's pet we've always wished for. But is it fostering more human connections in classrooms, or are we nurturing a generation of screen-bound loners?

**AI Knows Best (But Does It Really?)**

You might have noticed AI making decisions for you, even when you don’t directly ask it to. From the ads tailored to your digital footprint to the next show recommended on Netflix, AI seems to be whispering, 'I got you.' But at what cost? As we surrender more decision-making to machines, are we enriching our lives or just outsourcing our essence?

**The Privacy Puzzle**

Hill raises the question: as AI formats our daily narratives, what happens to privacy? Do we resist the well-optimized life or embrace it, trackable footprints and all? Turning cyborg might sound cool in movies, but having your data essence floating in the cloud could make even the staunchest tech-lovers uneasy.

Randall Sanderburg: So tell me, what kind of a name is Jalaq?



Jalaq: Egyptian. My family hails from Cairo.



Randall Sanderburg: I see. So why didn't you join our Cabin in Cairo?



Jalaq: I'm not from Cairo. My parents married in Cairo, but moved here to nyc 4 years before I was born.



Randall Sanderburg: Well, that's certainly interesting. I'm glad you had the chance to join us. You certainly seem to have quite the work ethic. I've never seen someone go from initiate to Honored Scholar in a month. That's really impressive!



Jalaq: It was so easy I thought you had at least 50 different ranks.



Randall Sanderburg: \*chuckles\* No, no. Our ranking system is very simple really. First you need to go through the required ranks. We put these ranks in a category called the ""Journey of truth"". The Journey of truth requires a member take up their required minimum teachings to be fully accepted a brother of our order and allows you to take different paths. The Journey of truth comprises the following ranks:

Initiate, Apprentice, Avid Reader, Adept, Practiced Brother.

Once you finish your Journey of truth, you can go through multiple paths. There's the path you have taken, which is the ""Historians Pilgrimage"", which comprises the following ranks:

Young Reader, Reader, Practiced Historian, Senior Reader, Scholar, Honored Scholar.

There is also the ""Law of statistics"", which comprises the following:

Law Student, Average Lawman, Expert Lawman, Secretary of law, Logistics Officer.

And the final path you can take is the ""Way of Honor"", which contains:

Noble Messenger, Tempered Noble, Royal Noble, Royal Guard, Royal Brethren, Ornamental Brethren.

A Practiced Brother may take up all 3, and when all 3 are completed, you have a chance to become a High Admin of your Cabin, but only if there is a spot. There may only be a total of 8 High Admins. And every High Admin has the chance to one day become their nations Most Enlightened and join the Ruling Circle.



Jalaq: What of the Eavesdroppers?



Randall Sanderburg: Eavesdroppers? You have your history down. That's great! But there are no Eavesdroppers anymore. They don't do the job in the modern day. Same with the Guards that used to guard Cabins back when our Cabins were actual cabins. We need to adapt with the times.



Jalaq: I guess so.



Randall Sanderburg: So you think you'll ever shoot for becoming a High Admin? You have the work ethic.



Jalaq: One day. Right now I want to focus on deciphering Sacravarian records that have long been untranslated.

1ksdnt9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ksdnt9,Club Hooves,"Hi there. I've been meaning to do this for a while now. I dont know how to tag Honest Camel but hopefully they can respond to this post and give their honest opinion here. Anyways. In regards to Baby Waylon having a Clubbed right hoof. Then the mention of him unable to stay sound as well as her saying he cannot be shown and could maybe be a walk trot horse or a trail horse. I wanted to show my horses feet and how not every horse with awful hooves has to go down this path. Which is why I feel his lameness may indeed be something else entirely and not actually his club foot itself. Or perhaps a combo of things. Now....this is my AQHA gelding Jazz. I got Jazz when he was 4yrs old back in 2007. His front feet were like this then and have always been this way. Im still looking for other photos in the daylight as well as on solid harder ground but its going to take more time to hunt them down due to how long ive owned this horse. These were what I could find for now. As you can see he is clubbed on both front feet. Each one in a different way as one foot is a 000 in horse shoe and the other is a 00 in horse shoe. Hes also pigeon toed on both front feet as well. Mind you hes 16 hands and 1300lb QH on those tiny ass feet. When he was in shoes he went well under saddle. I rode him thru 3rd level dressage. Hes a very nice horse and totally not a western horse despite his breeding lol. Not all horses with major hoof issues like club feet can't be ridden or stay sound. What I will say that this horse taught me is this. Trim the hoof that's in front of you for what it is. Not what you WANT it to be. When he was young I had vets and farriers constantly try to correct things about this. Guess what? He always went lame and stayed lame. Like for months and months. When left alone and trimmed for what he was he stays sound. His biggest flaw is hes most comfortable in shoes but they never stay on. Hes the type of horse that would go out to turnout with bell boots on and come in missing both bell boots and both front shoes. 🤦‍♀️ he would even lose a shoe in his stall. Of course after a while I committed to him staying barefoot. He thought I was trying to unalive him. He was lame for a while. However him ripping his shoes off yanking tons off hoof off with it was destroying his feet. So that's why we finally went barefoot. Eventually he toughened up and was sound again. Large rocks are hard for him so we do avoid that but in arena footing. Grass. Dirt. Pavement. Hes fine. Hes just gimpy on large driveway rocks. Hes always been thin soled. I dont have x rays from when I got him. The x rays I'll post are from years ago. Its hard to say what they may have looked like when he was 4 but im sure they also weren't great. He has had laminitis and founder when he became overweight when moved to a property with no stalls so was on 24-7 turnout. We resolved it. I promise these photos do not show just how awful his feet are. I once had a boarding facility call me because a new worker was struggling to identify horses in the field. To her they all looked the same. Clearly this person shouldn't have been working alone but I told her...""oh you can't miss Jazz just look at his awful front feet."" She goes ""oh...yep that's the one I have in my hand. Thank you."" 🤣😂🤣 I'll attach a few photos. His x rays and his pedigree. Im not a western person so I have zero idea if any of these horses have genetic hoof issues or if Jazz just happened to be unlucky in the conformation dept. I wanted to make this post to bring awareness to the fact that horses with club feet can definitely go on to have careers. Maybe not all of them or maybe not the career you had planned but alot of them arent automatically crippled. Sometimes its a matter of letting the horse tell you what they like and what makes them most comfortable. In Jazzs case everyone trying to make his feet look pretty and normal did more harm then good and caused constant lameness.

1ksdjku,https://www.reddit.com/r/personaltraining/comments/1ksdjku/supply_demand_why_pt_education_fails_before_it/,Supply & demand: why PT education fails before it begins,"**The Demand Problem**

The first mistake is thinking this is just a supply issue—bad courses, dodgy RTOs, lazy instructors. That’s all true, but the real Crohn's disease in the leaky gut of the fitness is demand. Most of the people signing up for Cert III and IV have no interest in learning. None. They want a fast track to looking legitimate so they can post shirtless photos and call themselves a coach. They don’t read. They don’t train seriously. They've never had a trainer, because they were too broke to have one because they were useless at every other job they've tried, and anyway they know everything already. ""I've trained myself for years, so I'll be a good trainer"" is like saying, ""I've masturbated for years so I'll be a great lover."" They don’t ask questions unless it’s “Is this in the exam?” Practical placement hours are a box to be ticked, they won't perform a single squat, let alone teach one, so the supervisors give up and have them dust treadmills. 

The idea that they’re joining a profession where human beings trust them with their bodies doesn’t even register. You can’t train someone who doesn’t want to learn. The industry lets them in anyway.

**The Supply Problem**

And of course, the providers are happy to oblige. RTOs aren’t built to produce professionals, they’re built to keep the funding flowing. Units of competency are watered down to accommodate the lowest common denominator. Mentorship? Non-existent. Practicals? Mostly a farce. The instructors themselves are often failed PTs or box-tickers who’ve found their way to the other side of the teacher's desk because it’s easier than working the gym floor. The whole structure is self-protecting. If they raised the bar, they’d lose customers. They're paid for who signs up, not who passes, and they certainly don't get more money just because their students become successful trainers years later. So they don’t bother. They just push clueless students into the sausage machine and use the ground-up meat to feed the illusion that certification equals competence.

**Raising the Bar, Losing the Battle**

It’d be tempting to say the solution is simple: raise the entry requirements, make it harder, filter the herd. But that’s not a scalpel, it’s a sledgehammer. Sure, you’d knock out the idiots, the clowns, the sleazy sales reps in activewear. But you’d also lose the quiet ones, the strays, the late bloomers who could’ve been brilliant with time and space. You lose the unemployed 20yo who was great at sports in high school but not good enough to go professional, and has a grandma on her walking frame, so he understands everything from the crippled to the high performers. You lose the mother teaching snatches to other mothers in her garage while her toddler snoozes in the pram. Talent doesn’t always arrive in the form of a first-round draft pick. Some people don’t shine until they’re 30, or poor, or working full-time and learning under a squat rack at 5am. Raise the bar too high, and you smack it in the heads of the very people who could’ve made a difference.

**Letting the Market Work**

So then you get the libertarian fantasy: let the market decide. Let the good coaches rise, the bad ones fail, and natural selection sort it all out. And sure, that happens. Eventually. But that’s cold comfort to the clients who got injured, misled, or far more often just slowly disillusioned by someone who had no idea what they were doing. The market punishes failure, but it does it slowly and retroactively, after the harm is done. It’s like saying, “Bad drivers will crash eventually.” Sure. But someone’s in the other car. And someone’s walking across the intersection. It’s a system that relies on collateral damage to function.

**Culture, Not Curriculum**

There’s no clean policy fix. You can’t legislate passion. You can’t write a national framework that produces curiosity, or compassion, or the slow-burning obsession that makes someone good at this job. But you can build a culture that values those things. You can stop pretending that a certificate makes a coach. You can demand that new trainers show up early, watch, learn, ask. You can honour the ones who keep studying ten years in, not the ones who get loud on Instagram two months out. The old apprenticeship model wasn’t perfect, but at least it understood that skill takes time. If we want good coaches, we need to stop pretending they can be mass-produced.

And those of us who are experienced have to reach out. That guy asking questions on reddit who happens to be in your town? Invite him to your gym. Offer internships. If you can't afford that, at least offer a coffee and a chat, and a few encouraging messages online. Offer your expertise here. Write articles. Write books. If any of your clients look interested in becoming trainers, encourage them, and guide them. Get your clients to help in the gym, spotting people. Get your experienced clients to offer their advice and support to others, or simply create a gym environment where that's expected. 

There aren't apprenticeships, so let's make a thousand informal apprenticeships. Don't worry, you're not creating competitors. In the Anglosphere pushing 75% of people are overweight or obese, in Australia the National Disability Insurance Scheme is now more expensive than Medicare, and in my age group 80% of men are on a daily medication. Don't worry, there's enough clients to go around, your competition isn't other trainers, it's the couch.

It is important to note that this story took place in 2016 and many of you will probably realize why when I get to the end of it.  The high school in our area was outside of the small country town close by, so most people got there by bus.  However, there were a few of us who lived out of town and were close enough that we could walk.  I was one of these people.



I was 16 and a junior in high school when this happened.  It was in the fall as well, probably sometime in October.  I lived in the opposite direction from the town.  I could walk down the main road until I got to the road my house was on, then turn there and walk along the road until I got home.  However, I didn’t tend to do this because the walk was longer.  Instead, I would cross the main road, walk through a field and then walk through a forest to get to the road my house was on.  This was a diagonal shortcut to that road and would save me a lot of walking.



There were normally a few other kids who lived in the area I did who walked through that field and forest too.  They were guys that I grew up knowing and still know today.  But on this day, all three of them were not walking with me.  They were all on the football team and had a practice so I was walking all by myself.



I didn’t mind walking by myself, but I did mind the fact that it was raining lightly outside.  I didn’t mind getting wet, but I did hate walking through mud.  I didn’t have a choice though, since my parents worked in the afternoon and evening and were unable to come and pick me up.  But since it was raining lightly, I thought I could get home quickly enough before it got really bad and soggy outside.



As soon as I crossed the road, I noticed something moving up ahead of me in the forest.  It was too far away to see who or what it was, but I didn’t really care.  It was likely someone who was involved in the maintenance of the area.  Honestly, I didn’t put any thought into who it might be at that point in the afternoon.



It began raining harder the closer I got to the forest.  Also, the rain was really cold and it felt sharp as it was hitting me.  



It got a bit better when I eventually got to the edge of the forest.  It was a pretty thick forest and although most of the leaves had fallen from the trees already, it was still thick enough to stop some of the rain from pouring down on me.  Honestly, though, I was so wet already that it didn’t matter much how much wetter I was going to get.



As I was walking through the forest, it had gotten pretty dark due to the cloud coverage.  Even through the noise of the rain. I began hearing some other noises around me.  It kept catching my attention and I would look around, expecting to see a deer or something out there.  But I never was able to connect anything with the noises in the beginning.  But I was beginning to feel a little scared as I made my way through the forest.



About halfway through, I heard a snapping sound.  And When I looked over in the direction of the sound, I know I saw a shadow run behind a tree.  There was someone out there and I remembered seeing the figure from earlier.  



Immediately, I thought about clowns.  I had been following the horror news, if that is what we can call it, and this was in the middle of the clown phenomenon back in 2016.  So, I thought that one of the guys from school was probably trying to take part in that too.  It was known that a few of us walked this way after school, so it had to be someone from school trying to scare and I thought that was pretty lame, to be honest.



Although it was raining pretty hard by that point and much of the rain was getting through the branches of the trees, I wanted to confront whoever it was.  I was already soaked too, so it didn’t really matter if I got any wetter.  



I began walking over to the tree that I had seen the figure hide behind.  I was really interested to see what silly clown disguise the person had on.  



However, when I got over to the tree, there wasn’t a clown standing behind it.  There wasn’t anyone standing behind it.  But there was something there that freaked me out.  I am not going to go into detail about this because it would really upset some people, but there was a slaughtered animal laying on the ground behind the tree.  It was so upsetting that all I could do was stand there and look at it.



I don’t know what made me turn around.  I might have heard something, or maybe I just felt someone looking at me.  But I did turn around and I saw the figure standing off beside another tree.  He was not dressed as a clown, though.  He was a kid I knew from school though.  And he had blood on him, which I had to assume came from the animal.



“Hey, come here!” he called out to me.  “You wanna see something scary?”



No, I didn’t.  I told him I had to get home and began walking.  After a few steps I turned around, half expecting him to be following me home.  But he didn’t.  He just stood there for a while.  I kept checking over my shoulder and eventually, one time when I turned to looked, he was no longer there.



When I got home, I told my parents about it.  They didn’t seem to care though.  They didn’t think it was worth calling the school about.  I saw killing animals as psychopathic, but they simply didn’t see it that way.



I told a few friends about what happened and they told me it was no surprise.  The kid was whacked and had done some really weird stuff in the past.  Most of us felt he would be in jail by the time he was 18.  It’s probably not a surprise that this actually happened.

 

Number Two:  Hunting



I am aging myself, but this happened many decades ago.  This was back in the days when I was young enough to still go hunting.  Although my favorite kind of hunting was coon hunting, that’s not what I was up this weekend.  However, I was going to stay out in the woods overnight for one night.  



The weather was fine but it was pretty cold out.  I didn’t have much luck finding anything the first night out.  I always used to think that the animals were aware of their hunting season came around and that they would all try to hide once it did.  



I didn’t bring a tent with me when I did overnight hunting.  In my younger years, I was quite the outdoorsman and didn’t mind sleeping on the ground, using my backpack for a pillow.  I did bring a light blanket with me because even when it is really warm, I cannot fall asleep without having something covering me.  However, this night was going to be pretty cold but I had done this over and over again and would be able to sleep fine.



I woke up in the middle of the night and wasn’t sure why at first.  I was normally a really sound sleeper who would only wake up during the night if I had to go to the bathroom.  This wasn’t the case this time.  Something else had woken me up.



I looked around, trying to see if anything was different from when I went to sleep.  But it was really, really dark.  I had chosen to go hunting on a night where the moon was nothing but a tiny crescent in the sky.  So I didn’t have the benefit of much light.



Then, I heard something.  It was the sound of someone stepping on something.  It could have been an animal or a person, I had no way of knowing.  But either way, I had to be as alert as possible.  



I stood up as quietly as I could, still trying to listen to anything that might be out there.  For a few moments, there was still nothing.  This made me more nervous though.  If I had heard an animal out there, it was less likely for the animal to stop moving around than it would have been for a person.  Being that I was a bit of a country guy myself, I knew there were people even more rural than me out there.  And they really hated it when people encroached on their area.



I didn’t call out in case it was a person.  I just stood there, for what seemed like a long time, listening for anything further.  



Finally, I heard something that sounded like a person moving very quickly through the leaf covered ground.  I knew the way that most animals sounded, so I knew for a fact this was not an animal.  There was someone else out there with me.



I reached to the side of the area that I was sleeping.  There was a tree right there, I had leaned my rifle up against it.  I was reaching for the rifle, but still looking in the different direction into the forest.  



But when I expected to close my hand on the gun, I ended up grabbing nothing.  I turned and looked at the tree.  Although, like I mentioned, it was very dark outside, I could see clearly that my rifle was not leaning on the tree.  I looked on the ground in case the wind had blown it over.  But it wasn’t on the ground either.  Frantically, I searched the area for the rifle, but couldn’t see it anywhere.



The only explanation, and the immediate one that I thought of was that whoever I had heard had taken my rifle.  That was pretty scary, but also really angered me.  So, I let my anger take over and I ran over in the direction that I had heard the noises come from.  My rifle was very important to me and I was determined to get it back.



I kept hearing the noises of someone moving through the woods and I kept following them.  I continued to do this until the point that I heard a gunshot ahead of me.  



I stopped and just stood looking in the direction that I had heard the shot from.  It was very, very close to me.



Suddenly, someone ahead of me stepped out from behind a tree.  I couldn’t see him very clearly but I could tell that he was holding my rifle.  He also had it pointed at me.  He then lowered it down and I was about to rush him before I watched him take something out with his other hand.  I could easily tell that it was a really huge knife.  So I immediately stopped.



We stood there for a little while, simply looking at each other.  I knew I couldn’t say anything or make a move because he had both the rifle and a knife.  I just waited to see what he would do.



Finally, after a long period of time, he finally did something.  “Quit following me or I will shoot your kneecaps off and gut you with the knife.”  He then quickly began running off into the forest.



I stood there for a while, not sure what I could do.  I finally decided that I could do nothing.  I had absolutely no way to defend myself from him.  I had to give up.



I also wasn’t going to spend the rest of the night out there.  I was a bit scared.  I had been hunting a lot in my life and that was the first time such a thing had ever happened.  I didn’t feel safe and there was no chance I would be able to get back to sleep.



I eventually got a new rifle but I also began hunting in a different area. 

Number Three:  Visitor



A storm had been brewing for quite a bit of time.  We lived in the hills and were able to see a large expanse of the sky.  So, we saw the storm clouds as they were just appearing over the horizon and watched them as they were approaching.  The clouds were very dark green and black and it looked like it was going to be a really nasty storm.



The thunder and lightning began long before the clouds even stretched across the entire sky.  I always loved storms, so I was out on the porch and watching as the clouds crawled closer and closer to us.  Even from a distance, the thunder was really loud and I could tell that it was going to be one hell of a storm when it arrived.



The wind picked up too.  Nowadays I know this happens when the pressure in the area falls, but at the time I just liked it.  I would estimate it was 20 MPH winds with gusts up to 60.  Several times when the wind hit me, I felt that it was going to knock me and my porch chair over.  We didn’t have a lot for entertainment because we didn’t have television at the time, so watching the storms was always a highlight for me.



It got so dark when the clouds overtook the sky and I stayed out on the porch for as long as I could before the rain began falling.  It was falling so hard too that had I not gotten up and retreated into the house, I would have been soaked and wet within seconds.  



At the time, my mom, my sister and I were the only ones who lived in the house.  I was in my teens and my sister was ten.  They were both the opposite of me and scared of storms.  So, it didn’t help at all when the electricity eventually went out on us.



Fortunately, we had a wood burning stove that we could use to cook on as well.  We always kept wood in the house too, so it was dry and we started up a fire.  It was cool enough that it was nice to also have the stove to keep us warm.  



This was one of those really fierce storms too that went on for a very long time.  When the sun went down, it was still raging on outside.  It didn’t seem like it was going to let up anytime soon and we likely wouldn’t get electricity back anytime sooner.  Being as far out in the hills as we were, we were fortunate to have electricity at all, but when it went out, it would often be a long time before it came back on again.



I am not sure how late at night it was, but eventually we were all surprised by a very loud knocking on the door.  We didn’t answer it right away mostly because we were startled.  So, after a few moments, there was more knocking.



My mom went and answered the door.  I had no idea who it could have been.  We did have plenty of family in the area but it didn’t make any sense that they would come knocking on our door during a bad storm.  



Eventually, my mom let someone in the house.  I don’t have a great memory of what the guy looked like, but he was probably in his late 20s or early 30’s.  The way he was dressed, we assumed that he had been out hunting and was caught in the storm.  He didn’t have a gun on him,though.  



I immediately didn’t like this guy.  Something about him was off and he was really creepy.  If I had answered the door, I wouldn’t have let him in.  But my mom has a soft spot and trusts other people a lot more than she shoud have.



My mom got the guy a towel and then a blanket and she put the kettle on the oven to make some tea.  We didn’t drink coffee back then so it was the only hot drink available.  My sister and I were sitting on the couch and the guy was sitting in a chair that was close to the wood burning stove.  He was just sitting there, looking at my sister and I in the chair.  My sister felt even more scared of him than I did, because I could tell when she was fidgeting on the other side of the couch.



The guy didn’t really talk very much.  He would mostly answer questions with a nod or such rather than saying anything.  But there was a lot of awkward silence in the room, which was only broken by my family.  It in fact got so uncomfortable that I got up and went to my room, telling my mom I had to do a double check on a homework assignment.  I really had another reason for going in there and it was one that proved to be correct.



Coming out of my room, I noticed that the guy had taken a pocketknife out of his pocket.  He was finally talking, but using his hands a lot when he was talking.  He was waving the open knife all around and I could tell that it was scaring my mom and sister.  My mom asked him to put it away and she asked really politely.  He simply ignored her and kept doing what he was doing.



“We brought you in out of the cold rain,” I told him.  I walked into the room with my hands behind my back.  “You need to put the knife away.”



Looking at me, the guy got up and he took a few steps toward me.  I was holding my gun behind my back and brought it out for him to see.  My grandpa had given me the gun on my 13th birthday but hadn’t told my mom about it.  He told me I needed it to protect my family since we didn’t have a dad in the house.



The guy stopped in his tracks.  He closed up the knife and put it away.  He then tried apologizing, although it sounded like he didn’t mean it.  



“You need to leave,” I told him.



He smiled and said, “You are not going to shoot me, boy.”



I pulled the trigger, giving him a warning shot.  I wouldn’t be surprised if he shit his pants right then.  The look on his face suggested that he did.  



He immediately took off out the door and out into the rain.  My mom ran to the door and locked it with the doorknob lock and a chain lock.  She continued to look out the window to make sure he left.



She was a little mad at me for having the gun without her knowing about it.  But other than that, she was happy that I was able to tell the guy was trouble.  We don’t know what he wanted because I didn’t give him a chance to let us know.  We were just happy he was gone.

  I was just diagnosed with mild Crohn's, however I have had severe symptoms from canker sores, burning stomach, extreme bloating, abdominal/epigastric pain, nausea, diarrhea, urgency to go, burping and hiccups OFTEN, horrible horrendous awful gas OFTEN and then even cramping and pain after passing stool. These symptoms have been different but on and off for years, but mostly has gotten really bad in the past year. 

   I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy about 2 months ago, and my doctor confirmed very mild apathae in my terminal illeum and a lot od irritation of the stomach and beginning of small intestine. I just had a CT Enterography done because I pushed thinking there was more going on, but it came back completely normal and no inflammation shown and no other abnormalities of my other organs, which is dissapointing given I have so many symptoms. Which I have been on budesonide for almost a full month, and it has helped some.

   I have had digestive issues for many years and had been diagnosed with biliary dyskinesia back in 2021, which basically means my gallbladder has a low ejection fraction, no stones, nor sludge. So, since that diagnosis I excused any symptoms to the gallbladder, however unbeknownst to me (until I realized), my liver enzymes stablized and I had less gallbladder area feelings (I never had ""gallbladder attacks"" nor pain, just a feeling in the area)

   Anywayss, I think back on the years of different symptoms and wonder if it has just been Crohn's the whole time. I'm still having symptoms, even on budesonide, the pain and burning has calmed down, but my bloating and urgency and just ""wierd feeling"" throughout my abdomen bothers me constantly. I had already stopped eating Gluten and Diary about 6 years ago because of my digestive issues. I stopped drinking alcohol a year and a half ago because I rarely drank anyways and it always made me feel crappy. I don't drink any carbonated drinks because it has always made me uncomfortable and burpy. The ONLY thing that I know could be causing me issues is sugar, I don't really eat candies, but gluten fre baked good get me everytime lol. So I know I should cut sugar, but like thats the only thing I have given not gluten and no dairy. I also have cut back on my coffee/tea intake which is the only thing I drink besides water and juice.

  ALSO I have had increasingly worse period pains for the past 3 years, and I'm wondering if any women have also experienced worse period pains that coincide with the Crohn's? Also, what do you take for pain? Ibprofen is the only thing that helped me and tylenol barely even touches the period pain, but NSAIDS are supposedly not good for Crohn's, so I am kind of at a loss for the period pain. Heating pads help, but I can't really use them for work or anytime not laying in bed lol

     I have questioned if I have Endometrosis, but that is an entirely different beast given that I have 0 trust in most doctors and the only doctor I have really been able to get through to is my GI. I know that if I want to seek a possible diagnosis for Endo, that I have to probably go to a specialist, I'm just mentally and financially exhausted of the doctors visits.

Does anyone have any recommendations or healthy productive advice, or personal experience? Please be kind and do not offer anything that is not helpful or that is mean or hateful, or misery inducing. ",1,1747873081.0,CrohnsDisease,1,1.0,False

I am hanging out with this guy for like 4-months now. I am really so confuse about what's happening we are not dating but it feels like our thing is just like we are in relationship. 

So it started on a first meeting that he invited me over in his place for a late night dinner cause he's cooking. But before that we've been talking for a month already and he just decided to randomly asked me for a dinner at his place. Well I felt comfortable going cause I mean we've been talking for a month already. We got so close and we share the same vibe. 

Well I went over to his place and we had the dinner he was cooking infront of me and we are having a good talk with a good wine. We bonded in really a good term and we have the same vibe. 

The first meeting is really good untill it follows another meetings, untill it's our habit to atleast meet once every week for a coffee or to hang out and do some activities together or if we have time if we are not busy we would be meeting on weekdays. Sometimes I'll go to his place or we will meet outside. 

We have this deep talks conversations that we shared secretly, we became comfortable at each others company. If i go to his place he'd just let me do what I want and it feels like it's my 2nd home. To the point that I am wearing his clothes sometimes, he'll do the cooking for us tho' he knew that I am a good cook. He is taking care of me, even when we go out for lunch or for a coffee he will pay everything and he wont let me pay for anything. He will set up a week end plan activities for us all the time. I am also shocked that when his bestfriends from Germany came he called me first to meet them. They even came to my work place to visit me, they waited for my lunch break to be over cause they wanted me to join them for lunch. Well I really get along with them and everytime they go out they usually including me in their plans, which is I am not expecting. By the time his friends was here for vacation they stayed in his place. That time he still asked me to go over to his place to hang out on my day off's or sometimes if I have a free time. Sometimes I stay there for a night or sometimes he will drop me home back if i wish to go home. 

It's so over whelming that he even teaches me how to sky diving tho' i have a fear of heights and he patiently teaches me to overcome it. Now I am okay and I am not afraid of heights anymore. Next thing he is planning again to teach me how to play golf some other activities that i don't know how to do. On the hand he even plan with me some future activities that is like 3-mothns or way far for a year plans.  On my birthday he gave an exclusive gift that I mean It was a cute gift that I really appreciate it. Because the gift screams effort. ( he made a voucher for me to claim 3 wishes that I wanted to do what ever it is and regardless what it is) I mean this is so priceless  

But the thing is we are not dating and we have no label at all. I know his type and we talked about it before cause he have business and he is focused with it. He is even talking to my boy bestfriend more like a brother to me. He told him that he wanted me to be part of his life. Like this really confuse me. His actions and everything is really so confusing. Not gonna lie something is happening between us. More of that he's allowing me to use his phone and his laptops. In his place he's keeping some of my stuff. He even went the mall searching for a gear for me to use on the skydiving. Like he searched for it and he even called me while I'm at work what my size is. I mena we even go together for a shopping to change his wardrobe style and he even ask for my opinion all the time. And about his business he oftenly ask me for advice and my opinions.  Lastly I know he is not dating anyone and I am certain with that. And he is not hiding me to anyone, hell go publicly with me in anywhere. 

I mean what is this? I am so 100% confuse  ",2,1747872517.0,AITAH,10,1.0,False

Initially it became manageable via warm milk with clarified butter at night but that was short lived. It was god awful- there were times when I didnt poop for 3-4 days, and the pain of passing small balls (sorry but not sorry for how yucky this is) was killing me. It was so bad I even passed blood sometimes.

I didnt like the idea of taking stool softener daily to solve for this. Im not crunchy, I love modern medicine and will defo be pumped full of drugs during delivery, but taking a tablet daily during pregnancy bothered me unless its for a serious condition. No hate to those who do, I just personally didnt wanna do it.

So I searched and tried. Dried figs and 2 dates in the morning with hot milk did move the needle, but only a bit. Decaf coffee helped a bit. Walking helped. But then I hit upon a miracle- sunflower seeds and psyllium husk combo. Both are packed with deadly fiber- combined almost 15 mg with a handful of sunflower seeds coverings and 2 large spoons of psyllium. Its been some time taking them with milk and I kid you not guys- I passed a foot long poopy today. I started weighing myself before and after poop- and while each day shows a decent gap, today the needle moved by 4 freaking pounds.

This is better bowel movement for me than before pregnancy. Now even though all my joints are on fire, I can barely walk straight, I have sciatica and shooting pains, and Im ALWAYS annoyed, so much so that I shout at least once a day for god to kill me- I somehow feel at peace after the poops.

1ksd5h7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ksd5h7,My three best friends ditched me in Paris and then dropped out of my wedding.,"So I wanna start off the story by saying that I am typing this on my phone so ignore any typos please. I’m also dyslexic so that doesn’t help. The wedding is over now and I am happily married to my best friend so I feel like now is the time to get this off of my chest and tell my side of the story. I’m not really the type to run around and talk shit about people so telling strangers on the Internet will just have to do. Last year I got engaged and I was so happy. My fiancé proposed to me in the Dominican Republic and the first thing that I did was FaceTime my three best friends. After I got proposed to one of my best friends (let’s call her D2 since she is the little sister of D1 my other best friend) started being rude to me out of nowhere. It was subtle bullying. We went on a lake trip to Cumberland and I wouldn’t jump in the water so she told me that “you don’t like to do anything. You’re so boring now” another time I was joking about how the lady who did the Botox for my lip flip messed up and now I couldn’t smile and was essentially making fun of myself, and she turned to me and said “you’ll never be happy with anything”. She also joked about how if I got kidnapped the kidnappers would bring me back because I talk too much. All because I said that I share my location with my parents still because I’m scared of being kidnapped when I go out at night. It was always just unnecessarily mean things whenever I would make a comment. I have many more examples, but I don’t want to make this too long. 

I tried talking to her about it when the four of us went to a winery together. I said to her you and I have been butting heads recently. What’s that about? Her response was “well I’m a Leo and you’re a Virgo.” I looked at her confused and she said “I am a fire sign and you’re an earth sign” me still being confused laughed, and I realized she was being dead serious, I changed the subject. She obviously didn’t see anything wrong with how she was treating me. I talked to my friend M, which is my third best friend about this situation and she urged me to talk to her, but I did talk to her. After every time she was rude to me I would say “that was kind of rude” or something like that I would always address it, but she always made sure to be rude to me away from M and D1. 
So let’s get to the Bachelorette trip. I didn’t care where we went. I didn’t need anything super extravagant or crazy. I just wanted us all to have some fun and be able to go to a place that we wouldn’t have the chance to go to again. Now I had already been to Paris and I loved it a lot so when they suggested Paris, I was excited because last time I went there, I didn’t get to do everything that I wanted. I was a bit worried though because D2 volunteered to plan the whole trip. I wondered why D2 who had been my bully for almost a year now would choose to plan my entire Bachelorette trip . As the trip was getting closer, she wasn’t asking me what I wanted to do or including me in any of the plans. I assumed it was because it was going to be a surprise for me, but then when she gave the itinerary, I realized that this trip wasn’t about me at all. It was just a vacation for all of us. It’s like this wasn’t my Bachelorette trip at all. The only thing that I got input on was what outfits we wore on the last two days. I picked an all pink night and a sparkle night so that we could take pictures in front of the Eiffel Tower while it was sparkling in our sparkly outfits.

Now the trip was going wonderfully up until the last two days. So it was the pink night we were supposed to go out clubbing all in our pink outfits and to go to a play, but D2 got so drunk that we ended up having to take care of her that whole night. She cried the whole night while throwing up in the toilet. We held her hair back and didn’t end up doing anything that night. I bought everyone McDonald’s and we stayed in to take care of her. I wasn’t upset about this as long as we still had the next night to have fun.

The next night came. We got all dressed up to go out for dinner and on the way walking to dinner. We walked past a cute little pizzeria. D2 saw a very attractive French man working at the pizzeria and she smiled at him and we talked about how handsome and he was . D2 was the only one in our group that was single. On the way back, he was still there. D2 then ran into the pizzeria, took him out and invited him to come out with us. I didn’t care as long as he was cool. I didn’t mind if he hung out with us that night. He came out with us to a bar. We ordered a bottle of wine and hung out for a little bit With him and his friend. I still had every intention of going out that night. But then when this man said he didn’t wanna go out clubbing and then D2 said she didn’t wanna go out either. I became really disappointed. She was ditching the group to have sex with a complete stranger. Then D1 also said she was tired and was gonna stay in M’s room. now M and I had a full-size bed and her and I both barely fit in that bed. I said I really didn’t wanna share my bed with two other people. M and I were very disappointed because we wanted to go out. It was our last night in Paris. On the way back to the hotel we pushed D1 to go out with us. D1 said “well if I have to looking at me” and I said back to her “well no I guess we’ll all go to sleep”. Me being very disappointed went up to the hotel room that I shared with M and sat on the bed. M told me she was then gonna go buy more cigarettes and asked if I wanted to come. I told her I might come down later, but I was too upset and needed to chill out. I then changed my clothes and got into bed and fell asleep.

The next morning, I woke up to the sound of someone coming into the room and then very quickly rushing back out of the room. I then fell back asleep and woke up about 15 minutes later realizing that M never came back to the room. I texted the group asking “Are we gonna get up early to explore”. And this is when they told me that they had went out the night before and pulled an all nighter without me. The person who is quickly coming into the room was M. She was grabbing something from the room. And they were hopping on a train without me. I will place photos of the text messages below so you guys can read. I was so hurt that after I expressed so much the night before that I wanted to go out that they then spent the entire night out without me. They didn’t even wake me up in the morning when they went out to get coffee. M even came into the room and didn’t ask me if I wanted to go with them to go get coffee. It would’ve been so simple for her to just ask me if I wanted to come. It feels like it was done deliberately.

We ended up going to the Louv that day, and I only brought up the situation one time. We got food after the Louv, and as we were sitting down waiting for our food, I said. “ how did you guys even end up going out last night? I was under the impression that everyone was tired.” There was a long pause of silence. D1 and D2 just looked down at their phones and M was the only one to answer. She said “ I went down to the lobby and found D1 down there (she was waiting for D2 to get finished having sex with the French guy since she didn’t obviously want to be in the room while they were having sex and D1 and D2 were sharing a room) so we went and got cigarettes together. When we came back, D2 was bringing back (French guy’s name) to the lobby. We sat in the lobby for a while chatting, and then just decided to stay up all night and explore the city.” I said “okay” and didn’t bring it up again because I wanted to enjoy the trip and I just wanted my peace from it.

Since they spent the entire night out before hand, the rest of that day they spent sleeping in the hotel room. Our last day in Paris was wasted sleeping in the hotel room. M kept pushing me on what I wanted to do because I guess she felt guilty about what had happened the previous night before . When I told her that I didn’t care what we did and that I just didn’t wanna get left out she snapped at me and left the room leaving me by myself ditching me again for about an hour and a half before coming back. When she came back, I had suggested that we go shopping and had about three different shopping areas picked out. When all four of us met back up again, I suggested them to the group, but D2 didn’t wanna go to any of these places and she picked her own shopping mall. When we got there, it was closed so we didn’t get to go shopping. 

The next day we were home and days followed, acting like nothing happened until M reached out to me telling me that she was upset with me. Her and the girls had talked and decided that I ruined their trip and I treated them horribly by accusing them of ditching me. She gaslit me into thinking that I ruined everyone’s trip and that I made everyone feel horrible because of how I acted. I messaged the group telling everyone that I didn’t mean to make them feel that way. And one by one they told me they didn’t wanna be my friend anymore and that they were dropping out of my wedding.

I’ll put those text messages in here as well. I know that D2 was not my friend at this point. I didn’t think D1 and M would treat me the way that they did. I guess I’m glad that this happened sooner than later, but it doesn’t make it hurt any less. I wanna make it clear that they never spent any money besides the money that they spent to go on this trip. My wedding was a month away from this trip and they still hadn’t bought their dresses. I wasn’t asking them to buy a specific dress. I just wanted them to wear something they felt comfortable and beautiful in. They didn’t help plan my bridal shower at all and my mother and mil had been trying to get them to help them plan it for months. I don’t think they ever planed on being in my wedding.",0,1747872364.0,okstorytime,2,0.5,False

The recruiter said I’d hear back in 3 weeks, but when he stepped out, the VP said more like 2 weeks realistically—so I figured I’d just wait it out.

But then the next *day*, I got a call inviting me to meet the same VP again, this time for an informal coffee chat. She said the first interview was “only an hour” and she didn’t get to ask everything. We met today at a local coffee shop, and it felt pretty relaxed. She was friendly and asked a lot of personal questions about my background and stuff then at the end when we were parting ways she told me she still has two more people to speak with by the end of this week (it’s Wednesday now).

We've been planning a move to the greater Indianapolis area. Currently Lawrence area is one spot we're constantly. Largely because of its proximity to family and proximity to Ft Harrison State Park. It seems like you can get a pretty nice home near wooded areas.

The cultural center at the park and the ability to easily access nature trails really caught our attention. Right now we're primarily shopping out just north and just west of the park.

Is there anyone that lives in these areas that could share their experience? I'm curious about:

- Are the neighborhoods walkable or bike able?
- How is the farmers market on Thursdays?
- Do people get engaged in the community and arts events?

I was also wondering if you all had recommendations for:

One morning at the Solar Flare Plant Base, I woke up early to finally arrange a day of rest. After her morning tea, she went to the fridge, where the main prize was waiting for her: the last strawberry doughnut.

She opened the door.…

And froze.
There was no doughnut.
A satisfied slurping sound came from the kitchen. Solar Flare abruptly turned around and saw Green Shadow sitting at the table. She was leisurely finishing just that very doughnut and didn't even think to apologize.

-""Did you eat it?""  Solar Flare asked, squinting as if before a sunstroke.

-""Well, he was lying unguarded. This is a military zone, no one has canceled the rules."" grinned Green 
Shadow, sipping her coffee.

Solar Flare gritted her teeth. A small flame broke out behind her, not out of anger, but out of principle.

-""Do you realize that it was MY day?!""
""So let there be a day of forgiveness. Forgive me, sunny.""

But Solar Flare did not give up so easily. The chase through the base began: They knocked down a stack of recipe magazines, dropped a decorative cactus, and almost tore down the door to the balcony. Green Shadow was hiding, Solar Flare was advancing, the fire was getting hotter.
In the end, they both got tired and collapsed on the sofa in the living room. There, under the pillow, Green Shadow felt... a spare box of donuts.

-""Um... it's not yours?"" ""What is it?"" she asked.

—No, but it's mine now,"" Solar Flare said sternly, taking the box.
Green Shadow raised an eyebrow:

Solar Flare sighed and nodded,
—""Okay. But the strawberry is mine.""",1,1747872007.0,SolarFlare_corner,1,1.0,False

She’s a 15 lb, one year old Chihuahua mix named Lily and she if great with other dogs and cats. We actually adopted her because she’s great with cats and lived with cats in her foster home. My cat is comfortable around small dogs and Lily fit in with her pretty quickly and within the first week they were cuddling together and playing. 

Lily has picked up her crate training and potty training within the first month and has even mastered potty bells. We introduced her to my in-laws large bernedoodles and Lily adores them. So far we’ve had the most perfect dog but we’ve been struggling with her reactivity with guests. 

She is pretty nervous when house guests come over and although she wants pets and to be close, she’ll snap if they make any sudden movements. The first time she reacted to a houseguest was 3 weeks in when we had two friends over. She would come to sit next to them and fine with pets but when they would reach for something on the coffee table she would snap at them. She has never actually made contact with skin but we want our house guests to feel comfortable in our home! 

She has gone in to grooming appointments and vet appointments and has never reacted or snapped even though she’s scared - it seems to be only in the house that she reacts! Additionally - once she is super comfortable with a person, she no longer reacts. She used to snap at my in-laws but after spending a weekend with them while my partner and I were away, she was absolutely fine. She didn’t snap the entire time we were away and is her usual love bug self. Now whenever we go over, she is still super comfortable with them. 

I would love some advice as to what’s worked for other people! Lily is such a sweet dog and we want her and our guests to feel comfortable. ",2,1747871961.0,reactivedogs,0,1.0,False

I may have dabbled a bit in earlier Battelfield games but my actual entry (as in: play regular and follow the series) was Bad Company 2. From here I played everything but Hardline (I was told it's actually good?) and 2042(I skipped after what felt like lackluster support of BFV).

From Discussions or ""Discussions"" I do get why some favour class locked weapons. But having played other games with similar mechanics, where everyone can play each weapon but classes give Buffs/Debuffs to weapon behaviors, I am not against it.  
  
One example is Killing Floor 1. Every class can Buy & Play each weapon but those that complement the class are usually giving you the best outcome...and in the end everyone spamms a dozen C4 on the Patriarch but that is a different story.

What I mean by that is, that they CAN make this something interesting. However if the class based effects are neglible this will become a problem and derail the entire thing. But I'll wait til I see it in action.

In regards to Serverbrowsers... I don't need it for the regular play as long as one is given for custom games (in regards to portal). I had my favourites back in the day of Counterstrike 1.6/Source. Gungame wasn't always builtin and anybody here remembers the Warcraft servers?(TLDR: Counterstrike but with a WC3 inspired class selection).

But man...when Halo 3 released, I did not miss a Serverbrowser. I don't know how many hours I played but it never occured to me, that the Serverbrowser was a missing thing. This may be a result of the days with actual communities and getting random invites to custom games from people you just played with. And then you get to see ""Trashcompactor"" for the first time or play ""Fat Kid"". Those were the days but the people made them not the Serverbrowser.

Anyway, as long as custom stuff get one, I think we'll be fine. If not, they'll really need a solid solution to making Portal work with MM.",0,1747871957.0,Battlefield,6,0.26,False

Her hot tub and pool backyard project is basically done.

Jess is gonna show us something at her moms. It’s her mom’s gym that they all use. 

Why does she talk about everything for like 3 mins. She doesn’t have time to drive back and forth to the gym so she does it here. She’s trying to sell you on an app. I’m not recapping it. It’s about strength training. 

Jess works out in ill fitting clothes.

The dogs have chewies. They like to swap. Picking Lilia up to take her to dance. Landen has soccer today which is unusual. He’s guest playing for a more advanced team. 

Fridays are usually chill but today is the busiest day ever. Jess has 400 hair ties in her car. Dropped off Lilia.

Jess is a water girlie but she likes the double rainbro from Dutch bros now thanks to her biffle sunkissed fart knocker.

5 second montage of Lilia dancing. Lilia doesn’t like going to soccer games. Soccer montage. I kinda hope it’s most of the rest of the video. Damn. It’s not.

Mother’s Day soccer game. Happy Mother’s Day yall. She’s going to mom hard. She wants to know if you spend it with your kids or get a break.

Soccer montage. It was a good game. Landen’s team won for the whole league. 

There’s a package from ruggable that has a note on it saying it’s her Mother’s Day gift. She says she bought it herself. Kids say happy Mother’s Day. Worst camera work of all time. Jess reads cards. She got something but the camera work was so bad I didn’t see what it was. Group hug. She got a bag thing and towels and cups and candy and an umbrella for her phone to not overheat. Hersheys kisses. Aloe gel. One of those boxes that paper butterflies go everywhere when you open it. She knew what was going to happen and she’s bad at faking surprise. She got another thing too that Landen explained but I couldn’t understand what he was saying and I don’t care so I’m not pausing and zooming in. 

Mimi got really lame Mother’s Day gifts. They’re at a soccer game again. Montage. 

Jess has her makeup off and shit and the video is finally over and hopefully you all have a famtastic day.

Clickbait translation: she didn’t expect Mother’s Day gifts for Mother’s Day? Or she didn’t expect that she would have a Dutch bros drink she craves? Your call.

I’ve always been a slightly chubby all through my life, a midsize girlie if you will. I think my ideal weight is around 128lb to have a normal BMI. During Covid, I exercised almost daily ( mostly cardio) and was on meal replacement (Herbalife, please don’t judge me) which helped me lose a lot of weight. I have always struggled with having a good relationship with food after I stopped Herbalife as I always feared I’d gain weight. Lo and behold that happened couple of years later. Even though I’m midsize, I’m pretty active. I play badminton, I am always game for outdoor activities, be it trekking or cycling etc. it’s never really reflected in my weight though, because of which I have pcod. I know how directly proportional pcod is with weight. This also gives me anxiety when I skip my periods. Right now, I have started going to office for about a year. I only drink black coffee ( with 2 small hazelnut creamers), my first meal of the day is at 12PM and then I do dinner. I try to reduce on carbs as much as I can during lunch. During dinner, I eat only as much as I can handle. I also go to the gym consistently  about 3-4 times a week. I train with men ( my bf and other friends). We mostly do strength training. I would really appreciate if any of you would give me your two cents on what I can do to help reduce weight. I am seriously considering on getting back to meal replacement for lunch to help with losing weight. Maybe not Herbalife, but whey protein shakes? With your comments/ opinions, I’m really hoping to turn my life around and feel more comfortable with a normal BMI and period cycle.

Much love and thanks in advance!


Edit : forgot to add that I always crave something sweet after lunch/dinner. And absolutely cannot help myself if there is something sweet around me. No self control whatsoever.

The job is huge. Her sister is pregnant. And let’s be honest—no one can actually afford real estate in Toronto. A run-down beach house on the coast of Bedford calls to her in a way she can’t explain, and she buys it without ever stepping inside. But the second Eva sets foot in the house, something shifts. The creak in the floorboards. The pull in her chest. A feeling that she’s been here before, even though she knows she hasn’t.

As she navigates a demanding new job in a boys’ club boardroom and the messiness of coming home—complete with an unresolved history with Nate, the almost-love of her life, and a forbidden crush on her devastatingly charming colleague, Eric—Eva starts finding letters. Pages tucked into corners of the house. Written by a woman who signs only as “E.”

They’re messy, longing, painfully honest. A woman writing herself back to life, one confession at a time. And somehow, the story unfolding in those letters starts to feel… too familiar. Like a version of Eva’s life, lived once before.

Set against the foggy cliffs and deep quiet of Nova Scotia, *The Letters You Left Me* is a metaphysical coming-of-age for every woman who’s ever been told to fix herself. It’s not a how-to guide. It’s a love letter. To the girl you were. The woman you became. And the one you’re still becoming.

**Prologue**

**March 19, 1973**  
**Bedford, Nova Scotia**

No one tells you that being a woman means saying goodbye to yourself—quietly, and often.

First, you’re a daughter. Then a partner. Then, if biology and pressure and timing align, you become a mother. And with each new title, something slips beneath the surface.

A want. A voice. A version of you that once whispered *what if*?

You trade sleep for bottles. Ambition for structure. Curiosity for the comfort of knowing what’s for dinner. The woman you were becomes an echo in your own house—hovering somewhere between memory and obligation, between who you were and who you’re still pretending to be.

Most women don’t notice when it happens. Not right away. But one day, you’re standing at the sink. Or the end of the bed. Or in the line at the pharmacy—half-listening, half-existing—and it hits you:

You’re not entirely here.

You’ve been fading in pieces.

You’re quite literally a piece of Swiss cheese. Littered with holes. The parts you took out of yourself, once filled with the expectations of others, now patched over or left gaping.

But here’s the thing about motherhood—The innocence of those babies, the way they arrive still shimmering with truth—you want them to stay untouched. Whole. Exactly who they are.

And somehow, that hope for them…it shines a light through all your holes. Reveals the pieces you tried to erase. The selves you didn’t protect. And that’s when you realize you’re lost. Not because of them.But because of what they ignite in you.

I didn’t mean to disappear. I just… did.

So today, I picked up a pen. Not to remember who I was—but to find who I’d forgotten.

What hurt.  
  
What I wanted.  
  
What I never said out loud.

I don’t expect anyone to ever read it. But if someone does – if they’re anything like me – restless, too good at coping. Maybe they’ll remember.  

That womanhood isn’t a vanishing act  
  
Motherhood isn’t a graveyard.  
  
And survival isn’t the same as living.

Then maybe when I’m done with this, I’ll finally understand it. Maybe I’ll remember all the pieces of me.

Because I’m not lost.

I’m returning.

And I’m writing myself home.

—E

**Chapter 1 – The Pull** 

My chest is tight. My skin doesn’t feel like mine – warm in some places, numb in others. Like my mind slipped out during the night and came back with someone else’s secrets.

It’s always the same. A familiar ache. A foreign echo. A dream I can’t quite remember, but never fully forget. It slips away the second I open my eyes, but something about it lingers. A weight in my chest. A hollow drop in my stomach. Like I’ve witnessed something sacred. Like some version of me is still out there, wandering, trying to find its way back.

Maybe I’m being haunted…or maybe Lauren’s “spiritual residue” finally seeped through the wall. 

I close my eyes again. One breath in. One out. *Pull it together, Eva.*

My fingers fumble across the duvet, searching for my phone like it’s a lifeline. I need a hit of dopamine. Something stupid and distracting. A toddler hurling spaghetti. A dog riding a Roomba. That woman in Utah who slow-dances with her llama.

Something. Anything.

Instead, I get Nate.  
  
He’s sun-kissed and half-naked, holding a wakeboard under one arm. Beads of water slide off his shoulders, a reminder of what once belonged to me. Those same shoulders that once pressed into mine, pinning me to a mattress in the quiet hush of Sunday mornings. His mouth at my neck. My legs locked around his hips. His name, spilling from my lips in prayer.

My thumb hovers.

I remember that lake. The hoodie I used to steal. The way his hand would find my knee at a stoplight.

Life with Nate could’ve been beautiful. Predictable in the softest, sweetest way. But we were afraid of slipping into those well-worn grooves of small-town love. Of becoming Costco-wardrobe-clichés whose social life amounted to small talk at school pick-up.

You know the story – passionate lovers who go through the motions: love, marriage, family — only to end with a love that unravels under the weight of unspoken resentment and compromise.

So, we broke up before we broke.

And I’m still not sure if that made us wise or just afraid.

He stayed. I left.

And yet every time I’m home, we find our way back to each other. Magnetic. Harmless in theory. Messy in practice.

I press my palms to my face and breathe him out. His scent, his laugh, the version of myself I was when we were us. My Nate.

Now, just Nate.

My Nate.  
  
Now…just Nate.

My bedroom door flies open, slicing the moment in half. 

Privacy, it turns out, is optional when you're not-quite-but-almost late for work.

“Wakey, wakey, cornflakey,” Lauren sings, already halfway into my room.

She’s fully dressed. Silky hair curled to perfection. Earrings in. Outfit onpoint. Like someone who doesn’t wake up, but rather *rises*. If I didn’t love her, I’d push her out a window.

“There are morning people,” I groan, “and then there’s you.” 

She marches for my blinds and yanks them open with the delicacy of a leaf blower. Light blasts me straight into the afterlife.

“You live like a vampire,” she mutters and tosses a yogurt at my head.  

I barely catch it. “Coconut? You monster.” *It’s the ultimate betrayal.* 

“It’s all that’s left, sorry” she shrugs. “Anyway, chop-chop, buttercup. It’s your last day, I’ve got a 9 a.m., and I need to make a pit stop at Darnell.”

I rub my eyes. “Is this about your chakra malfunction again?”

“Last week he said my third eye was glitching,” she says, completely serious. Like we’re talking about engine failure.

Darnell is the sage-wielding mystic outside St. Andrew Station who accepts spiritual donations in spare change or cold-pressed juice. *Apparently, $13 beetroot blends are the key to unlocking the astral plane.* Anyway, Lauren swears by him – but she also swore her last situationship was her soulmate, so…there’s that.

“You’re right,” I mumble, swinging my legs out of the bed. “Your third eye *has* been glitching lately.”

She claps, delighted. “Thank you! Now put on pants.” She disappears down the hall, her energy too large for our condo’s square footage.

By the time I shuffle past her on my way to the bathroom, she’s in the kitchen, barefoot, dancing to a playlist that swings from Stevie Nicks to Cardi B.

I flick on the bathroom light and regret it immediately. I look like a thumb. Pale. Puffy. Whatever the opposite of dewy is. Droughty?

Maybe it’s aging, I *am* almost thirty.  
  
Or maybe it’s the fact I haven’t had more than four consecutive hours of sleep in weeks. Stress and caffeine are my primary food groups now. That, and self-doubt.

I brush my teeth with one hand and scroll with the other. **Halifax.** It’s everywhere. Headlines, internal memos, the ‘Gram. The world is buzzing.

The NHL is finally expanding a franchise to the beautiful East Coast of Canada – and I’m leading the rollout.

No pressure.

Everyone else says “I got this”—Lauren, the partners, the fucking NHL itself—but me?… I’m not so sure.

I’m still catching up to the version of myself that made the pitch.

Boardroom. Glass. Mahogany. Walls lined with mock-ups and market data. Mad Men shit.

But what sealed it wasn’t the visuals. It was the tone.

The owner—mid-fifties, grey suit, eyebrows like punctuation—rested his hands on the table and said, “The positioning landed hard. It didn’t sound like ad copy. It sounded like home.”

I remember sitting up straighter. “The tone *is* the heart of it,” I said. “We’re not parachuting in with a tagline. We want the people of Halifax to feel like they’ve always had a place in this league. Like they’re always been a part of it. But at the same time… this franchise needs to feel like it belongs to everyone.”

He tilted his head. “So how do you bridge that? You and your team have the homegrown perspective. But how do we make sure it doesn’t get lost in translation nationally?”

“It’s not about translation,” I said. “It’s about reflection.”

A pause.

“You don’t just give people a taste of Halifax—you show them what it really *is*. The marrow of it.”

All eyes were on me as I watched the coastline in my mind. 

“The East Coast is different. People from Nova Scotia… they measure wealth in things like time and warmth and how many people they’ve fed. They’ll help you fix your fence, or stop you in traffic because your car looks like it’s leaning weird. And if they like you…”

I smiled. “You get the good biscuits.”

The table laughed. The table laughed. Even Eric, the NHL exec, who hadn’t cracked a smile all meeting. Then, the owner leaned back in his chair, nodding, “Well,” he said. “Give us the good biscuits.” 

That’s when I knew we had it.

Later that night, after the signatures were on paper and the champagne corks popped, Lauren hugged me hard enough to knock the air out of my lungs.

“I’m so proud of you,” she whispered into my shoulder. “Like, *stupid*\-proud.”

I nodded, but didn’t say anything. Some victories don’t arrive with fireworks. Just a quiet internal click.

And now? The Halifax chapter is officially open. I’ve got spreadsheets, flight confirmations, three half-packed suitcases, and a dog who’s suspicious as hell.

In the kitchen, Lauren slides a coffee into my hand — my little emotional support barista – as I scratch Willow’s golden head with the other. “Zuzu will be here soon to walk you, bub. Be a good girl, okay?”

She tilts her head and stares like I’m abandoning her in a blizzard. But I’ve seen the condo cam. The second we leave, she’ll be belly-up on the couch, living her best unbothered life.

Outside, the Toronto morning unfolds: streetcars groaning, pigeons panicking, the polite sound of horns going off.

Darnell stands at his usual spot, denim trench flapping, waving a bundle of sage like a lightsaber.

“Darnell!” Lauren beams.  

He squints through the smoke. “Indigo,” he declares, pointing at her like he’s casting a spell.

“That’s my colour. My third eye.” she whispers to me, proud.

“I thought Indigo was a bookstore.”

Darnell circles her with vague hand motions, then grunts something affirming. Lauren practically floats away.

She drops a five into his hand, as if she’s tipping a psychic bartender. I keep walking.

If I had an aura, I’m pretty sure it would be black.   

Lauren skips beside me, rejuvenated, like she’s just had her emotional sinuses cleared.

I smile, despite myself. Her belief in the greater being – whatever that is – is one of my favourite parts of her. She believes in energy. In signs. In the idea that maybe we’re not just atoms and memory and quiet regret—but something *more*.

She nudges my arm with hers. “You okay?”

I nod, then shake my head. “I don’t know. It’s like… I’m excited. But also, not.”

She studies me, “You have every right to feel overwhelmed, Ev. But you’re building something legendary. It’s not every day the NHL launches a new franchise.”

I exhale, but my chest still feels full.

At the subway entrance, a gust of wind lifts my coat. I turn instinctively. No one’s there. But for a second, I swear I felt—watched. Or remembered. Then a train whizzes by, and I catch my reflection – fuzzy in the dark glass. Jittery. Doubled. Like bad reception.

And I can’t shake the feeling from this morning, like I’m here…but not.

Our train finally arrives with a hiss. We board with the rest of the human flock, and I the overhead bar. Across from me, Lauren wedges herself between a guy in bike shorts and a woman wearing a sweatshirt that says: **Expensive and Difficult**. I mentally add it to cart.

After two stops, we arrive at Bay Street. We emerge into the sunlight, and I’m immediately betrayed by my body suit, which lodged itself halfway to my ribcage.

I do a mid-stride wiggle—*as discreetly as possible*—while making a silent vow, for the fiftieth time, to never wear one of these again.  

""Everything okay back there?"" Lauren calls. 

“Yup,” I grimace. “Veggie.” 

She snorts. “Fashion is pain.” 

Across the street, 100 Bay rises like a glass monolith. Lauren and I both work here – I’m on floor 17 at Rally, and she’s two floors below living her best Elle Woods life at Headon Law. We met three years ago in the lobby, bonding over the sight of a smokin’ hot security guard coaching a woman in active labor. Lauren called dibs before I even had the chance.

And while she had a fairly lackluster one-night stand, I secured a best friend for life.

We split at the elevator.

When the doors open at Rally I take it all in, one last time. Exposed brick. Glass-walled rooms. Curated plants. “Aesthetically mindful wellness,” they call it.

There’s a new bulletin posted by the kitchen, BURNOUT IS A SIGN, NOT A SYSTEM. Right. Inspiring. Interns whisper. K-cups clatter. Someone’s microwaving something questionable that smells like egg.

\---

I didn’t get much done today.

Not really. Not with people stopping by every twenty minutes to say goodbye. Most of them still smelled like last night’s send-off — and if I’m being totally honest, I can still taste the tequilla in the back of my throat.

Between the drop-ins and spontaneous cake in the breakout room (bless Jenna), it was more of a rolling goodbye tour than an actual workday.

Still, I managed to clear my inbox, adjust the rollout plan, and squash a minor PR fire by 4:15.

There’s a rhythm to it. Fast. Sharp. Addictive.

I love it.

But tomorrow, I shift gears — to something slower. Something steadier. Halifax.

 

We need to insert some stuff about closing out her day – how she didn’t get much done because people kept coming by her office to say their goodbyes, despite staying out far too late for drinks last night. How she’s going to be back in Toronto every few months for a week or so to move through critical project pieces.

By 4:15, I’ve cleared my inbox, adjusted the rollout plan, and squashed a minor PR fire. There’s a rhythm to it. Fast. Sharp. Addictive.

I love it.

There’s a rhythm to it. Fast. Sharp. Addictive.

I *love* it.

But tomorrow I’m adjusting to a new rhythm – a slower one – Halifax.

I close my laptop with a little more force than necessary. Slide it into my tote. Fold the branded notebook and drop that in too. And then I see it — tucked beside my mousepad.

A photo. Framed. Slightly smudged at the corners.

Me and Emma, last Thanksgiving at the beach bonfire. Her head thrown back mid-laugh, cheeks flushed, hair wind-whipped. Jake stands behind her, arms looped around her waist, throwing bunny ears behind my head. The brother I never had.

That was the night she told me I was going to be an aunt. Something shifted in me that night, just slightly – leaving me with a feeling that my axis was off balance, just slightly.  

I run my thumb over her face, then side the frame into my bag.

That’s when I hear the soft tap on the doorframe.

**“Hey superstar.”**

It’s Jenna – one of Rally’s senior partners – wearing a power suit that probably costs more than car. She was the one who told me to lead the pitch. Said Halifax needed someone who didn’t just know the place, but carried it in their DNA.

“Chocolate or peanut butter?” she asks, holding up two bars like they’re currency.

“Chocolate. Always chocolate.”

She tosses it to me and drops into the chair across from mine. 

“So. This is it, huh?”

“This is it.”

She tilts her head. “And how do you feel?”

I open my mouth. Close it. Shrug.

She watches me. “Ev, you’re going to kill it. And honestly? Picture this: you, wine, deck, ocean view, bra nowhere in sight.”

“Better than moving back into my old bedroom,” I say. “Still has glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling and a Backstreet Boys’ poster under glass.”

Jenna grins. “Nick Carter forever.”

I laugh. Thing, but real. Because the truth is…this is a lot. The job, the move, the house,  the aunt thing. Don’t get me wrong, I’m excited, but this new version of my life feels like it’s all happening at once – because it fucking is.  

And I hadn’t even meant to buy a house. Not there. Not *yet*. But something about that little place in Bedford tugged at me. Irrational. Unplanned. Magnetic. Like a part of me already lived there. And was waiting.

Anyway. “I just wanted to say... I’m so damn proud of you,” Jenna says, and it lands in the part of my chest that’s always bracing for impact.

I nod. “Thank you. Seriously.”

She glances around like she’s making sure no one’s listening, then sets a small envelope on my desk.

“This is from the juniors. Brace yourself — one of them used glitter.”

I open it. The card is covered in mismatched ink, with ""You're gonna kill it!"" written in five different fonts. There’s a dolphn stick placed directly in the middle – and yes, the envelop was filled with glitter.

I don’t know whether to laugh or cry.

As Jenna turns to leave, she pauses in the doorway.

“Oh—Eric asked me to pass along his congrats. He’s tied up with legal on the franchise onboarding stuff, but he’s thrilled to have you coming on board.”

My eyebrows lift.

“By the way,” she adds. “He’s smart. Intense. Comes off colder than he is, but give it a week. You’ll hold your own just fine.”

I smile, even though my stomach twists just slightly. “Honestly, I feel like the new kid on the first day of school. Just hoping they let me sit at the good table.”

Jenna laughs, lifting her coffee in a mock-toast. “Go make us look brilliant.”

After she’s gone, I glance around the office one last time.

The glass conference room. The stupidly expensive live-edge coffee tables. The spot where I once cried after a bad client review and blamed allergies.

 

It doesn’t feel like goodbye. It feels... paused. One year, two tops — and then I’ll be back. Right?

Still. I tap the frame of the elevator. One tap. Not sure why. Maybe to say thanks. Maybe because somewhere deep down, I know I’m not coming back.

The elevator dings. Doors open. I step in. A few juniors wave like I’m the graduating senior, I flash a smile as the doors softly close.  

When I reach the ground floor, I step out — and there he is.

Hot Security Guard.

Still stupidly hot, despite knowing from Lauren that he cries when he finishes. Romantic, really.

“Good luck,” he says, flashing a grin.

“Thanks,” I reply, already halfway to the door. “And, uh... your hair looks great today.”

He winks. “Doesn’t it always?”

I push through the glass doors into sharp Toronto air. My heart’s in my throat, tote slung over my shoulder.

I’m ready to leave.  
But not quite ready to arrive.

About as expensive as staying on Gulf of Florida. Would go again. LA fortuna was my favorite.

I'll start by answering what I think are frequently asked questions around this sub.

- From what I gathered asking locals is the weather is very unpredictable. With that said we mostly had night rain or morning rain. But they were short showers and didn't disrupt the trip at all. In fact the occasional showers we had in the day time were refreshing.

- This was not a cheap trip, everything is about the same as US. You can make it cheaper by cooking or sticking to eating sodas ...but rice, beans, and chicken gets old. 

-The roads were not nearly as terrible as I expected. Almost never drove over 40mph due to traffic/roads. We rented through Adobe which was seemless. I got the extra protection just in case. The most hectic part of driving was trying to get out of and back into San José. The city is a prime example of why traffic engineering is important.4 wheel drive was not really necessary unless you're going well off the beaten path and maybe some parts of Monteverde. I used a mixture of Waze and Google maps. I downloaded offline Google maps for when I had no service. Spent about $180 on gas the whole trip. 

- Credit cards were accepted pretty much everywhere and if you want to pay in cash, that's fine. 

- I never tipped unless the server we had actually put forth effort. Most of the time they brought food and drinks and left us alone, which I enjoyed.

Review: Family of 4 with 10 & 14yo


Day 1: Landed at SJO at 12:30. Got through customs and to the Adobe shuttle by 1:30. Adobe was awesome and shuttled us to their office 10min away. I was in and out in about 15min with a 2025 Hyundai Santa Fe.  We drove from San José, stopped at a Mas x Menos to break some dollars for a few colones and get some snacks. Headed out to Cahuita. The drive through the mountains was awesome along Rt 32. I expected treacherous driving from comments I saw, but it was no harder than driving through the Appalachian Mountains. Just pay attention and you will be fine. Arrived in Cahuita at 6:30. 
We stayed at the Hotel Encanta. Staff was wonderful and rooms were fine and air conditioned. Our vehicle was secured by gate. They served complimentary breakfast of fruit, bread, and eggs. They also have a restaurant which was delicious, although a little pricey. Had a sloth right outside our room the whole trip.
After we arrived we had dinner by the ocean at Sobre las Olas. Pricey but delicious. 

Day 2: We ate breakfast at the hotel and went on a hike at the Cahuita Reserve. Paid a $5 donation to enter...the cheapest of any park we went to. Beautiful reserve with nice views and saw monkeys.   Walked around Cahuita, which was small, but very walkable and safe. Had some delicious gelato/coffee at La Playa Coffee stand, right by the ocean. Ate dinner out.

Day 3: Breakfast at the hotel, and then drove down to Manzanillo Reserve and gave a donation. Beautiful, but muddy hike. Stopped at a few shops and a roadside place to eat. Worst food experience of the trip, but I should have researched a place beforehand. I'm pretty sure this is where my daughter and I got food poisoning. 

Day 4: Early morning as we booked a guide to take us for a chocolate making experience with the Bribri tribe. His name was Braulio and we booked through viator. This experience was well worth the money. Braulio was very knowledgeable and passionate about the Bribri and all the plants we saw. After the chocolate making trip he took us to a waterfall where we saw a lot of red dart frogs. We went to playa negro later to cool off in the ocean.This was the only time I felt sketchy on the trip as I saw some people exhibiting druggy behavior following us along the beach. We just got back on the road and left. We ate dinner at the hotel and then my daughter and I proceeded to vomit all night. Food poisoning lasted only a few hours and we were driving the next day, so it didn't really put a damper on the trip. 

Day 5: We left Cahuita and drove 4 hrs to La Fortuna. The drive was pretty easy and beautiful. We stayed at a place called Los Lagos de Campo, just 18min outside of La Fortuna. This was our favorite booking. The property had four villas that were modern and clean as well as a pool and surrounded by nature. The host showed us her peacock and parakeet, and was just the sweetest most hospitable woman. We cooked out that night on the property.

Day 6: Payed about $40 to hike the Mirador El Silenceo and got a clear view of Arenal Volcano. Pretty hike with a good climb and saw venomous caterpillars. Shopped around La Fortuna and ate at Spectacolar. Good tacos, but overpriced. 

Day 7: Full day of adventure rappelling/canyoning and rafting with Maquique Company. They were the best! Our guides, Kenneth, Mauricio, and Tom were so full of life and happy to see us have a good time. Did 5 waterfalls and the 6mi rafting was great for us as first timers. They provided transportation, fruit snacks, and a delicious traditional lunch at El Fogón de Chela. 

Day 8: Pool day,  Ate an early dinner at Red Frog cafe. This was so good we came back for breakfast the next day. Walked around La Fortuna until our night guided tour at Papas Place. My son had a blast (we all did, but he loves frogs). This is behind the family property which backs up to a preserve, so we saw tons of frogs and a viper and many insects. This is perfect for kids, as the walk is easy and you're guaranteed to see frogs. 

Day 9: Drove to Monteverde, which was a beautiful drive. The roads around there were the most bumpy and unkept as it's a mountain town, I guess. We stayed at rustic AirBNB walking distance to the children's eternal forest and Monteverde. We visited the butterfly house and got a tour from a very knowledgeable guide. Your ticket also gets you any time while you're in town. Ate at the treehouse restaurant this night, which seems like tourist trap. Food was mediocre and the prices were double. There looked like a lot of good food options here, but we just ran out of time and money to try them. 

Day 10: Payed $83 to hike the Monteverde cloud forest. It was quite beautiful and we saw many birds, including a Quetzal. I would have loved to hike other reserves in the area, but just couldn't bear forking up so much money for a hike. We ate dinner at La Cuchara de Abuela... wonderful empanadas!

Day 11: Drove back to San José and stopped at the Parque National Carara for a nice hike. It was $40 and the park needs some beautification, but we saw Scarlett Macaws, frogs, a snake and tons of lizards. Stopped by one of the best inopportune food  stops of the trip at restaurante Bar la 34. It was a little pricey but very delicious. Arrived at our hotel in San Jose (Hotel El Rodeo). 

Overall the trip was a blast with beautiful views and challenging experiences for my kids. Cahuita was the best in terms of cost, and the nature preserves were donation only. La Fortuna had the best experiences and the community we stayed around seemed close and happy. Monteverde was beautiful but I felt nickel and dimed everywhere.

Main question: 
Will they be able to get the base up my stairs? I have steep stairs with a bend in the middle. I cannot get a regular queen boxspring up the stairs. I can get a split queen boxspring up. I can’t imagine the queen base is just one solid piece that doesn’t come apart or fold in half, is it?? Because it seems like that wouldn’t fit up a lot of people stairs. I’d like to know how it is delivered.

Second question:
Good idea or bad idea on mattress choice?

I am looking at the tempur pedic Supreme medium hybrid with the ergo adjustable base. I’m about 195 pounds, sometimes sleep with my slightly larger partner, and when I’ve tried mattresses at mattress firm recently I prefer mattresses on the softer side.

(I am a side sleeper who gets sore at shoulders and hips, and both sleep and have sex in bed- feel feee to encourage me or talk me out of it.)

After over a year of testing, tweaking, and taste-testing with friends, baristas, and fellow coffee lovers, my partner and I are proud to officially launch Enamorados Specialty Syrups.

These syrups are made with real fruit and real ingredients. No fillers, no dyes, and no artificial junk. Just flavors that actually taste like what they’re supposed to.

We started this because we were fed up with syrups that tasted fake or overly sweet. So we spent the time to make something better. Flavors that actually work in coffee, matcha, teas, Italian sodas, cocktails, and more.

We’re fully licensed, FDA-compliant, and ready to ship anywhere in the U.S. We also offer wholesale pricing if you’re ordering for a business or an event.

You can check us out at enamoradosatx.com
DMs are always open or you can find us on Instagram: @enamoradosatx

Thanks for the support. We’d love for you to give them a try! 🖤

clear the ssl state;  
  
making new ones with git bash openssl commands in the folder which the pem and key are and yes i did write the exact names to make sure, it did created the pfx cert and i clicked to make it exportable but i dont quite remember if i clicked to make it carry a key (was it a private or public key?);

i've installed that pfx cert into the machine's trusted authentication certs folder;

i have the same cert into the personal certs folder;

.net (or angular idk, its on the client side but its named after asp.net) has a script that supposedly runs and automatically finds your ssl certs for that project, if it runs its not finding the right certs and if it doesnt, well, i gotta try it then;

the brower ssl cert manager says i only have localhost certs that expire in at least 365 days so the client is pulling a cert that idk where it is, but its the expired one;

the server in the other hand has a new cert but its supposedly invalid because something aint right, when i asked chatgpt to run a deep research it told me that dotnet uses the same cert for back and frontends and that its more of a hack and tends to cause problems, it told me that if its causing problems i'm better off making certs for each separetely;

i tried deleting node modules and reinstalling to try to remove cached old certs made by the webpack dev server package, no success;

Anytime the best thing on earth could happen like it did to me


I am twenty years old. I started university six months ago. I moved out in October. I come from a wealthy family. My parents have always supported me. I had the chance to live at home and study in comfort. But I didn’t want that.

I wanted to live on my own. I wanted to live like a real student. I wanted freedom. I wanted to learn how to take care of myself. And I wanted to stay focused on my studies without distractions. That is why I moved away. I chose a city that was not too far but not too close either. Just far enough to be on my own.

Now I live in a small apartment. It is in a high-rise building. Not a student dorm, but something similar. It is simple but perfect for me. I live alone. The place is small, but it has everything I need. I can cook. I can sleep. I can study. And I can enjoy peace and quiet. I love it.

On my floor there are two girls. They live just across from me. I noticed them on the first day I moved in. Both of them are very attractive. I think they are a few years older than me. Maybe mid-twenties. I remember thinking that they looked like the kind of women you see in movies. Confident. Stylish. Beautiful.

For the first two months, we didn’t talk much. Just small things. We passed each other in the hallway. We smiled. We said hello. Sometimes a short comment about the weather or something funny that happened in the building. But nothing more than that.

By December, it had been almost three months since I moved in. I started to feel more comfortable in the building. I wanted to do something to connect with people around me. Christmas was coming. And I thought that would be a perfect time. Christmas is about giving. It is about being kind and open. And I thought maybe it would give me a reason to speak to the girls more personally.

So I bought them flowers. Nothing big. Just two small bouquets. One for each. I knocked on their door and gave them the flowers. They were surprised but happy. They smiled and thanked me. It felt good. It was friendly, but also a little bit more. I liked them. And maybe I wanted them to like me too.

Later I found out that one of them was in a relationship. She was in a long-distance relationship, actually. The other one was single. I decided to ask the single one if she wanted to have coffee with me. Just casual. Nothing too serious. I didn’t know what she would say. But she said yes.

We went to a small café near the campus. We talked for over an hour. It was nice. She was smart, funny, and relaxed. A few days later she invited me to her apartment to watch a movie. We watched Netflix. We sat close. We laughed. After the movie ended, we kissed. Then we had sex. It was exciting. It felt natural and fun.

After that night, she told me she didn’t want a serious relationship. She said she wasn’t looking for anything official. That hurt a little bit. I liked her. But I also respected her honesty. She said she wanted to stay friends. With benefits. I thought about it. And I said yes.

After that, we saw each other more often. I came over to her place a lot. Sometimes we watched movies. Sometimes we talked. And sometimes we just had sex. It became something normal between us. It was fun. It was easy. It didn’t feel like a relationship, but it was something close.

One day she invited me again. She told me to just ring her doorbell and come in. When I got there she opened the door and looked at me. She smiled and said, “You can’t come in with your clothes on.” I thought she was joking. But she wasn’t. So I took off my clothes. I stood there in my underwear. Right there in the hallway.

She let me in. I stepped inside. The layout of the apartment is simple. You walk in and you’re already in the living room. Her friend was there. Sitting on the couch. I didn’t know what to say. I stood there in my underwear, feeling a bit awkward. But they didn’t seem to care. They just smiled.

She took my hand and led me into her room. We had sex again. More than once that night. It was one of the wildest nights I ever had.

In the morning I woke up. She was already in the kitchen with her friend. They were having breakfast and laughing. I walked out of the bedroom, still half-asleep. And then, she started talking about me. She told her friend how good I was in bed. Right in front of me. I stood there, hearing everything. I didn’t know how to react. It was funny but strange. I said I should go. And I left.

But we kept seeing each other. Almost every day. We kept having sex. I spent a lot of time in their apartment. It became a part of my routine.

One evening I came over again. We were watching something on the TV. Her friend was there again too. After a while, she turned to me and said, “Go to my bedroom. Get ready.” I knew what she meant. So I went. I took off my clothes and waited.

Then, her friend came in.

I was shocked. I looked at her. She looked at me. Then she smiled and said, “Are you not ready for this?” I couldn’t say anything. I was too stunned. I just stood there. But she was so attractive. And I was already in the mood. So I said yes.

It felt a bit strange. I knew she had a boyfriend. But I couldn’t say no. I was already there. And she wanted it too. So we had sex.

The next morning, they were both in the kitchen again. Like before. Acting normal. Like nothing happened. I got dressed. Had a small breakfast. And left for college.

That evening I came home. They invited me again. I went into their apartment. We watched a movie together. It was relaxed. After a while, I slept with the girl I had been seeing from the start.

After we finished, she left the room. I asked her where she was going. She said, “I’ll be back.” A few minutes later, the other one came in.

And what can I say.

I’m living the dream. It’s really, really the best thing that could have happend to me.

Hello! I am a 320***** partner at Starbucks, and my time here is soon coming to an end. These past four years have been incredibly special to me, and the main reason for that is you—my regulars! As I prepare to say a bittersweet goodbye, I want to express my gratitude to the people who have made my experience so memorable.

During my training, I learned about creating a ""third place"" and making our store a haven within our community. Customer connection is a core value at Starbucks, and at my store, it is the most important one. My fellow partners and I have dedicated ourselves to bringing joy through handcrafted drinks and little treats, allowing us to see so many lovely faces time and time again. I take great pride in knowing your names and orders and crafting drinks that bring you happiness. It means the world to me that our store is a space where you feel safe and enjoy spending your time.

There have been few greater joys for me than greeting a regular with a smile and genuinely connecting over the bar. I have learned so much about you—your jobs, your families, and your lives outside our café—and for that, I am truly grateful. Thank you to my dear regulars who have filled up my car at the gas station, gifted me dinosaur toys at Christmas, given me birthday cards and even joined me on my first solo flight by complete coincidence. You've connected me with people in my field of study at college, honked at me when you see my car on the street, and shared with everyone at my second job that I am *your* barista who makes you delicious coffee with a smile. Thank you.

I may brighten your day, but you should know that you are the shining light of mine.

There is nothing quite like that moment of kindness and connection I get to experience with you during the busy rushes of Saturday peak or on weekday morning mobile bar. I love recommending drinks when you’re looking to try something new. I love slipping a sweet treat into your order on special occasions. I love hearing your updates, meeting your friends and family, and making your drinks. I love that you make me love my job.

I want to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to all of you. It is ingrained in me to say thank you to every customer, but for you, my regulars, I truly mean it. Thank you so much, from the bottom of my heart and the rest of it, too, for letting me make your coffee. ",1,1747869427.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

Through countless late nights, coffee-fueled chapters, and stories born from both joy and heartbreak, he’s built universes that feel real—stories that have touched hearts, sparked imaginations, and found homes on bookshelves around the globe.

What started as scribbles in a notebook between diaper changes has become something legendary. His work is being studied, quoted, adapted—and more importantly, felt. His voice carries weight. His words build worlds people don’t want to leave.

But the most incredible part? He never lost himself.
He’s still the same kid who loved to fish. The same teen who stood by Elizabeth when the world doubted them. The same dad who reads bedtime stories to Thomas—even the ones he wrote.

I ended up asking him if he wanted to hook up on the night we met, and we did. He said he was down but also would like to take me out to dinner soon. I kind of indicated interest but didn't really say yes. I haven't really been dating lately and I'm not sure I'm ready to try again. I've seen him around a few times since then. We hooked up one more time two nights ago, and again he said he'd like to take me out, coffee if dinner was too intense, so I said that I thought that sounded fun but I needed some time to wrap my head around it. I said a week or two which is a little ridiculous but I'm asking for what I feel like I need/want to be comfortable. 

I passed him last night on bikes and we waved but didn't stop to talk. I texted to say that I was in a hurry and couldn't stop. He responded nbd. Later that night he texted again saying that he had gone to the place we met hoping to run into me. I responded that I had been there but left for a team competition held at a bar. 30 minutes or so later he showed up. I was really taken aback when he showed up, I didn't approach him, but I smiled to acknowledge him. I didn't invite him and I didn't particularly want to socialize or be watched while I'm trying to compete. 

Then I realized that he had replaced my empty beer with a new one, which again I didn't like unasked or unmentioned - the new beer just showed up on my coaster while I was distracted. Whatever, I didn't feel unsafe, although maybe I should have. I said cheers and stepped outside, indicating him to come with me. He did, we chatted for a short minute and then I said ""I didn't expect you to show up here, I just mentioned where I was. I need to pay attention to my team."" He said ok, he would leave and said he could pick me up later if I needed a ride. I said maybe, that it would likely be around 10:30 and I would text him if I wanted a ride. 

He left, I didn't really want a ride from him at this point, and I made other arrangements. Then he showed back up, I'm not 100% sure what time, but definitely before 10. He was just kind of lurking around watching me. I didn't really acknowledge him this time, and when the competition was over he was still there. I didn't say goodbye, I just packed up and left with my friend who was waiting outside to pick me up. 

He seems like a nice enough guy in most of our interactions, but I really didn't like any part of this. I know I shouldn't have said 'Maybe' to the ride when I didn't want one, I just didn't feel like getting into that he'd made me uncomfortable and I was too preoccupied by that to think of making up an excuse. One friend thinks I'm being silly and I should still go out with him. The other friend who I had mentioned him too was previously encouraging me to go out with him and get back out there.

Hey, fellow creators! 🎨✍️ So, picture this: you’ve got a million ideas racing in your head, a million tasks piled up on your to-do list, and yet, you still feel like you barely scratched the surface by the end of the day. Sound familiar? 🙋‍♂️

Well, let me share a little secret—*you don’t have to work harder; you just have to work smarter*. And guess what? AI is here to help you do just that! 🚀  

Here are some **killer AI techniques** that can seriously step up your productivity game:

1. **AI-Powered Content Ideas**  
   Ever faced the dreaded writer's block? 😩 Enter AI tools like ChatGPT and Jasper!  
   - **Use them to brainstorm**. Just throw in a few keywords, and voilà! You’ve got a heap of content ideas in seconds. 
   - It’s like having a brainstorming buddy available 24/7—no awkward silences, no caffeine-fueled panic. 

2. **Smart Scheduling**  
   When was the last time you felt your schedule wasn’t a chaotic mess? 💼  
   - Try using AI scheduling apps like Calendly. They can analyze your calendar and set up meetings automatically, sparing you that back-and-forth email dance.
   - Plus, it learns your preferences over time! It’s like having your own personal assistant, minus the need for coffee breaks.

3. **Automate Repetitive Tasks**  
   Seriously, who wants to waste valuable time on repetitive tasks? 😅  
   - Use tools like Zapier to connect apps and automate processes. For instance, you can set it up to automatically share your new blog post on social media. No manual posting required!
   - Trust me, your future self will thank you for this little time-saver.

4. **AI for Editing and Polishing**  
   Feeling not-so-confident about that final draft? 🤔  
   - Tools like Grammarly or Hemingway can give you a boost! They check for grammar, clarity, and even tone to help you polish your work.
   - Think of them as your super-smart editing sidekicks that totally have your back. 

5. **Analyze Your Audience**  
   Want to make sure your content hits the mark? 📊  
   - AI can analyze engagement data to give you insights about what resonates with your audience.
   - This means you’re not just shooting arrows in the dark; you’re actually crafting content your community craves.

It’s wild how much AI can do, right? But remember, the goal isn’t to let AI take over; it’s about using it to **free up more time** for *your creativity* to shine through. 🌟

Now, here’s a fun thought: What if you combined a couple of these techniques? Imagine brainstorming content with AI, automating posting, and then diving deep into writing—*dream* scenario, huh?  

Let’s be real, though. How do you plan to start using these tips? Or do you have any other AI tricks up your sleeve? Can’t wait to hear what you all think!",1,1747868666.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False
1ksbulb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanvaFly/comments/1ksbulb/found_this_hidden_gem_font_thats_perfect_for/,Found This Hidden Gem Font That's Perfect for Modern Branding (And It's Actually Free for Personal Use),"I've been hunting for the perfect sans-serif for a client project and stumbled across **Quartist font** \- and honestly, I'm kicking myself for not discovering it sooner.

# Why I'm Obsessed With This Font

So here's the thing - most geometric sans-serifs either look too cold and corporate OR they're trying too hard to be ""quirky."" Quartist hits this sweet spot where it's got personality without being weird about it.

**The signature feature?** These subtle quarter-circle terminals that give it just enough character to stand out, but not so much that it screams at you. It's like the font equivalent of that friend who's stylish without trying too hard.

# Real Talk: Where It Actually Works

I've been testing this across different projects and here's where it absolutely kills:

* **Tech startups** \- Looks modern without that ""we're disrupting everything"" vibe
* **Food packaging** \- Somehow works for both artisanal coffee AND mainstream snacks
* **Website headers** \- Super readable on screens, which half these ""designer"" fonts fail at
* **Logo work** \- The terminals create instant recognition without being gimmicky

# The Catch (Because There's Always One)

Free version is personal use only. Commercial license runs $49, which honestly isn't bad compared to what I usually pay for quality fonts. Plus the designer (Martin Somers) actually put thought into the character set - includes alternates for 'a', 'g', and 'r' which saves me from that ""everything looks the same"" problem.

# Weight Options That Actually Make Sense

Five weights: Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, Black. Not some random collection where ""Medium"" looks identical to ""Regular."" Each weight has a purpose and you can actually build proper hierarchies with them.

# Font Pairing Gold Mine

This is where I got excited - it plays nice with almost everything:

* Merriweather for that editorial feel
* Roboto Slab when you need something more mechanical
* IBM Plex Sans for body text (they just work together)
* Playfair Display for luxury vibes

# Why I'm Sharing This

Look, I'm not affiliated with this font or anything. I just hate when I see designers struggling with the same boring Helvetica/Roboto combinations when there are gems like this out there.

Plus, the backstory is actually interesting - designed at Central Saint Martins, inspired by Swiss typography but with contemporary tweaks. Not just another ""I made a font in my basement"" situation.

# Where to Actually Get It

Don't just Google ""Quartist font download"" and click the first sketchy site. The legit sources are listed in [this comprehensive guide I found](https://canvafly.com/quartist-font-guide/) that breaks down everything - licensing, installation, even alternatives if this isn't quite right for your project.

**Pro tip:** If you're on Creative Cloud, check Adobe Fonts first. Might already be included in your subscription.

# Bottom Line

If you're tired of clients saying your font choices look ""too generic"" but you don't want to sacrifice readability for personality, give Quartist a shot. It's one of those fonts that makes people go ""ooh, what's that?"" without making them struggle to read it.

Anyone else discovered fonts recently that made you rethink your go-to list? Always looking for recommendations!

**Edit:** Getting DMs asking for the full breakdown - [here's the complete guide](https://canvafly.com/quartist-font-guide/) that covers licensing details, installation instructions, and real-world usage examples. Saved me a ton of research time.

**Edit 2:** For those asking about similar fonts - the guide I linked mentions Codec Pro and Gramatika as alternatives. Haven't tried them yet but they're on my list now.

It’s making my bed, taking a long shower, listening to music I love, and drinking water before coffee. It’s saying “no” when I need rest, journaling when my thoughts spiral, and taking breaks from people who drain me. I used to think self-care was candles and bubble baths—but for me, it’s whatever keeps my mind steady. Mental health needs maintenance. I’ve learned that the little things I do daily matter more than the big resets I used to rely on. Self-care isn’t selfish—it’s survival.",1,1747868604.0,u_HealthIsWealthBlog,0,1.0,False
1ksbt2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditLaqueristas/comments/1ksbt2i/mooncat_donations_advertising_is_sus/,Mooncat Donations Advertising is Sus,"Many people have been asking - especially in the Mooncat sub - about the change in advertising from 10% of net proceeds going to cat charities to vague wording, especially with the prices increases and other issues like paying for the formerly free tool after 3 purchases of $70 each, and so on.  Especially since - at least on that sub - so many people got into Mooncat due to the donations to cats (not that people here haven't also, but it didn't come up as much in the comments.

So I sent an email to support on May 19th asking the following question:

Hi,

Can you please tell me what %/$ of every order goes to helping cats get rescued?  Also what rescues/shelters/foundations are being donated to?  

Thanks!

I received the following response 3hrs ago:

Which is super sketchy, especially since KONEKO is a cat cafe and not a charity like a 501c3 or even an animal rescue organization - however they do list their partners and rescues and charities on their website.  Mooncat, Kinetic Brands LLC, and even Michelle Lin is not listed.

So of course I emailed KONEKO to inquire about the brand's donations considering they changed their advertising language and refuse to give any info about how much goes to the cat cafe and am waiting for their response.  If Michelle buys her coffee there from her profits/salary or anything else that would constitute misleading advertising, and since the nail polish itself nor the ingredients can be used for cats that doesn't work either.  If she were to use the net proceeds to donate physical items to the cat cafe that would also qualify as a taxable deduction.  Since neither Mooncat nor KONEKO are registered charities or publicly traded companies I can't pull up their financials either.  Also, if you adopt a cat from the cafe and use the advertised proceeds to pay for their food and toys and other expenses that opens up a whole different can of worms.

If/When KONEKO email me back I will pass on their response to my inquiry.",280,1747868516.0,RedditLaqueristas,77,0.97,False

I don't love that but I can manage it and usually get things fully moving again by the end of the week before I take my next dose.

Today I ate some prunes, drank some black coffee, took a long walk, and all of that had the desired effect by lunch.  Yay!  An afternoon of working from home means that I don't have to worry about making a few more trips to the toilet.

Managed to get a load of laundry going as well but noticed a strange sound coming from my (unfinished) basement, where the washing machine is.  When the machine started to drain, the floor drain turned into a geyser.  Oh no!  Messy, but I called the plumber and started mopping up. 

Just to be safe, I did a test flush on the toilet.  Guess where that ended up?  Basement floor.

I really need to go to the bathroom again.  The plumber won't be here for 2 hours.   Please send thoughts and prayers.",17,1747868406.0,Zepbound,7,0.95,False

The first interview was at a branch and lasted about an hour with both a recruiter and a VP. The recruiter said I’d hear back in 3 weeks, but when he stepped out, the VP said more like 2 weeks realistically—so I figured I’d just wait it out.

But then the next *day*, I got a call inviting me to meet the same VP again, this time for an informal coffee chat. She said the first interview was “only an hour” and she didn’t get to ask everything. We met today at a local coffee shop, and it felt pretty relaxed. She was friendly and asked a lot of personal questions about my background and stuff then at the end when we were parting ways she told me she still has two more people to speak with by the end of this week (it’s Wednesday now). Before we wrapped up, she said I have her email and to feel free to reach out with any questions.

For context: I’ve only been working in banking for about 4 months, and this would be my first job in finance outside of retail banking. I’m a little nervous because I don’t have much experience, so I’m trying to read between the lines.

Is this second meeting a good sign? What should I be doing right now while I wait to hear back?",2,1747868333.0,careeradvice,8,1.0,False
