1hynj6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetisMichif/comments/1hynj6p/looking_for_perspective/,Looking for perspective ,"Hello,

I feel embarrassed to be writing this. So before I get into my question where I need some perspective on I want to state a few things so my perspective is understandable.

1. My father & I were both raised separate from most of our family. I don't know my genealogy other than from what I found on Ancestry.com. As a kid my dad mostly lived in Vancouver or Northern Minnesota.

2. I was raised by my father and step mother  to respect ""Native"" folks (I live in Minnesota, hence the quote marks around Native) and to always see them as my cousins and to never take from them, to honor them and to never do anything to endanger them. I live very close to the neighborhood where the American Indian Movement was started and is living on today.

3. I also was raised to speak French at home,  I grew up canoeing and camping - I was told that we were connected to nature. I had family friends that are Ojibwe, so learned about the 7 Fires Prophecy as a little kid. I deeply believe it. 

.... Ok. Last bit.

My dad grew up believing he was half Native, on his dads side. His moms side were French Canadian from Quebec. He passed away about 12 years ago.

My half brother did a test a couple of years ago and we are very little native American, which was a bit shocking, but being that there was some ancestry I wanted to know more.

I was able to trace our settlement from Quebec into Minnesota - into the Red River Valley. I had the exact dates, but I lost my old Ancestry account where they were stored. I think we might have traveled with Pierre Bottineau and settled in Red Lake in the early or mid 1800's.

I'm looking for my family, I honestly just am trying to connect some dots here. I don't want to be enrolled or to be able to get money or anything. I ended up spending some time in foster care in my teen years, I was removed from my home. I was a good kid, but there was abuse. 

I want cultural connection, I already do beadwork, I never do Native styles. 

My dad could have been twins with the owner of a nearby Native coffee shop.

Is it crazy to think that I might have Métis ancestry?

I read some articles on Ancestry that says my ancestors could have been intermarried in Quebec.

1. When you put memes, slangs and labels, discussion is discouraged. This is exactly what all parties want. The reason that middle class and educated people don't form a combined vote bank is exactly this. Wether you are so called ""Bhakt"" or ""anti-Bhakt"", its same. This is a pattern that I have noticed, discussions are discouraged everywhere in the world by forming a polarised opinion. Yet, the pro people and leaders, they debate in Parliament, have coffee outside together. They know, its part of their life. Nothing is personal. We take things personally and stop discussing.

2. And since we dont form a vote bank, we cannot call for a change. Religious groups (be it Hindu, Muslim or any other religion) and unions form a vote bank. Business man form lobbys. Thats why Maulanas get salary and now so do Pandits (in some state?). That is why there are freebies for union and ultra poor people. 

Its funny, people will pay higher tax -> State Government will call it Central Government issue -> Give free water etc -> Demand more money from CG -> If CG doesn't have funds, they increase tax -> People call out Nirmala memes and fight with Kejri memes and the cycle continues.

Look at this from business point of view. We, tax payers, are funding everyone's freebies because we are too busy with memes and labels figuring out who is doing it. Meanwhile, people of this business (political parties) are figuring out which Coupon Code / Membership scheme will get them maximum voters.

Solution?
1. Stop crying about tax. If you want to enjoy, focus on maximizing earning. Or Figure out how you can get into those business man lobby our religious lobby to enjoy maximum benefit of this game. No government will or can change this game. Democracy is game of maximum seats. Chor ka raja chor.
2. The only alternate move is to move out. And then you will find out, same game is being played everywhere but in different spectrum.
3.  Most important -> Debate. Discuss. Figure out the game. Dont fall for ""any"" IT cell and meme games.

Finally, I think if Caramel popcorn was taxed less, the issue would've been that the government doesn't care about health and do poor people need this popcorn or why not invest else where? I think its pretty good that officers (IAS or whoever are there) are doing good research before rolling out GST.

This is my(f21) first psychiatrist ever and I already got permission from my dad to see another one hopefully this month in another city.

They interviewed him first before me and when it was my turn, I made sure to emphasize the lack of focus and tightness in my chest I feel every time I think of the tasks I have ahead like having to study. 

They didn’t even tell me what I have but already gave me a prescription for Valproic acid, quetiapine, and some vitamins. Is this normal? After looking them up, I got BD but I don’t think I have it. The only symptoms I relate to are the depressive episodes but those were during my periods so I thought nothing of it. 

I guess there was a time recently when I might be in a manic/hypomanic state because I was not sleeping well and I’d often walk outside alone in the middle of the night to buy food and large cups of coffee for an all nighter multiple nights in a week. Plus I’d burn through my allowances and have to ask my parents money multiple times in a week but other than that, I don’t engage in risky behavior like gambling or hyper sexual acts. 

There came a time when I lost some friends I actually cherished but I thought it was just a quirk i.e. I lack discerning social cues because I say and do things I didn’t think were offensive them.

It’s funny because I was there initially for anxiety and adhd but got this instead.

The problem? New hires. Specifically, they’ve started getting in earlier than me and snagging it before I arrive. I don’t want to be that person who calls dibs on furniture, but come on! I’ve got seniority, right? Am I being unreasonable for silently resenting them?



For context, the chair has no assigned owner, and no one else seems to care where they sit except me. I’ve tried getting in even earlier, but it’s becoming a game of diminishing returns. Should I just let this go, or is there a subtle way to reclaim my throne without looking petty?

Wow, didn’t expect this to blow up. Thanks for all the advice! Here's what I’ve learned:

1hyn8oa,https://i.redd.it/f8dqm31idace1.jpeg,Could use help finishing this space ,"Hello, everyone! We have pretty much revamped this den/entertainment room with new flooring (had old carpet with pet stains) and it’s a clean slate right now. We modernized the built in by paining it a very light gray (not my choice), adding a fireplace, and will be mounting a large tv in that open space. The walls are all gray but open to suggestion of a different color in the future. The biggest thing is figuring what colors would work best in this area. We have picked out a new couch that is a dark gray but looks almost black. What would you do as far as rug, coffee table, curtains, pillows, etc? I’m thinking a medium/large size wood tablet. Would you do an accent wall or paint the bottom half a different color as they had previously but it was yellow and blue. There is a bar area on the other side with a sink and cabinets. Free AI hasn’t been much help. ",1,1736567078.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False
1hyn8kx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdventureDogsOntario/comments/1hyn8kx/looking_to_stay_at_the_ontario_parks_with_your_dog/,Looking to stay at the Ontario Parks with your dog,"We all know the frustration of trying to book a campsite through Ontario Parks as of late. There's nothing like sitting at your computer, 7 AM, coffee in hand and your fingers crossed that you’re the lucky one to score your perfect campsite.

***If you’ve managed to book already for the 2025 season, congratulations!***

I wish I were hopping on here to share some magical solution to booking Ontario Parks and guaranteeing that **PERFECT** campsite every time. Honestly, if I had that, I’m not sure I’d share it anyway… Not until after my sites were booked! Haha But, I digress…

There are a few things I have found help me score a good campsite that I wanted to share with anyone struggling:



**Make plans, but be flexible.** It can be easy to fall in love with a specific campsite, but being so set on one spot can set you up for failure. Instead, I go into booking season with a list of parks and campsites that meet my needs, including size, privacy level, hydro/non-hydro, and access to important things. This way, I can pivot quickly if my #1 pick is scooped up.

In addition to being flexible with the campsite, **try to be flexible with your dates** (when possible). I understand that working with vacation time at a job can limit this slightly. But if you can hold off a week, for example, to snag that ideal booking, it could make all the difference!

Weekday camping is another way to beat the competition, with weekends being far busier.



**Consider a less popular park.** As part of that flexibility, consider branching out into a less popular park. According to Ontario Parks, 50% of the reservations made by the end of March are made at their 5 most popular parks:

* Algonquin
* Bon Echo
* Killbear
* Pinery
* Sandbanks

Some of the best campsites we have discovered were at random parks we decided to try on a whim. You never know; you may find your next favourite!

 

**Have a reliable connection.** Booking a campsite is a race, and the first computer to snag the site wins. This may not be a concern if you live somewhere with super fast fiber internet. But living in the country with a questionable connection at times, it’s a valid concern! If you have to, consider asking friends or family members to use their internet.

But avoid public connections like the library or local café. Too many people are often logged on, making them slower or less reliable.

 

**Prepare your computer.** Before trying to book, you can take a few steps to help speed things up on your computer. Restart the computer. Close any programs besides the browser (and don’t open them until after you’re finished). Clear your browser cache before opening the booking site.

 

**Try non-electric.** Most of the in-demand campsites are electrical. I understand there are reasons to need electrical, and I also don’t judge anyone for *wanting* electrical. But what if there was a way to power your trailer *AND* have the freedom of booking anywhere?

(*Confession: I often work from the campsite. So, while we’re tent campers, having power is important.*)

Explore your options depending on your needs. Solar power and smaller power bank setups, like our Jackery, are a great way to power or charge what you need while having the freedom to book a non-electrical site.  

 

**Grab a last-minute cancellation.** If you’re willing to wait until closer to your trip and take your chances, you may be able to score a last-minute cancellation either by setting an availability notification on the Ontario Parks site or using the [Ontario Parks Cancellations](https://www.facebook.com/groups/642963122809166) group on Facebook.

 

In addition to scoring the perfect booking, here are a few considerations for booking an Ontario Parks site to go camping with your dog:

* Except for specified off-leash trails, exercise areas, and dog beaches, **all Ontario Parks require your dog to be on a 6-foot leash and under control at all times**. How well-trained they are and how good their recall is won’t change this.
* There are dog-free camping areas at some parks. Not only can you not camp there with your dog, but you should also avoid walking your dog through these campgrounds.
* **Dogs are not to be left unattended on their campsite.** If you can’t bring your dog with you to enjoy an activity or attraction (I get it, sometimes we want to check out something they can’t), you need to make other arrangements for their care.
* **ALWAYS clean up after your dog**. This is both a rule and a personal pet peeve. (*Why is it so hard to carry poop bags and clean up behind yourself???*)
* Dogs are not allowed on the beaches unless it is a [designated dog beach](https://thekaspack.com/tips-and-tricks-for-booking-ontario-parks/#dog-beaches-and-exercise-areas). Luckily, there are several parks with great dog beach areas!

 

**Some favourite Ontario Parks we’ve visited with our pups include:** Macgregor Point, Restoule, Port Burwell, Awenda, Lake Superior, Long Point, Grundy Lake, Inverhuron, and Six Mile Lake.  

If you’re on this sub, I'm assuming you either camp with your dog or are considering it. **So, what are your favourite provincial parks when travelling with your pup?** I’d love to add to our “must-visit” list!",1,1736567068.0,AdventureDogsOntario,0,1.0,False

I wasn’t sure how I was supposed to feel.

I wanted to share some simple things that have worked well for me, and hopefully it helps some of you 

*  Before you get help, you have to want to change your life. There is a big difference between HAVE to and WANT 
* Remove access - This is simple. The harder you make it to Gamble for yourself the better. If you're in a state that offers self exclusion, do it.  
* Remove access to the second voice - Once you remove the first level of acess, let's not lie to ourselves. We are the most manipulative intelligent people out there, we'll find a way to gamble. Maybe you'll get a bookie, maybe you'll drive to a casino. You have to beat that second voice ahead of time. Self exclude in the state next to you, text your bookie to never allow you to make a bet because you have a problem
* Tell someone close to you - This is very hard, but talking about it and owning it and having someone close in your life know is immensly helpful. Ask them to hold. you accountable. Yeah this is really hard to do, but will be worth it 
* Accountability and Discipline - You know what's fun. Smoking weed and betting on Texas Ohio State tonight. You know what's not, go to bed early and get ready for the gym tomorrow and looking forward to your coffee. You have to change your life style. Unfortunately, this is NOT fun and you don't get gratification instantly. BUT over 60-90 days you will notice something you never had - Peace, Happiness and a better version of. yourself

Tuscany. The very name conjures images of sun-drenched vineyards, cypress-lined roads, and charming medieval towns.  And at the heart of this magical region lies the Val d'Orcia, a landscape so breathtaking it's been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Ready for the drive of your life?

Forget the crowded tourist trails. This isn't about ticking off landmarks; it's about immersing yourself in the beauty of the Tuscan countryside. The best way to experience the Val d'Orcia?  A leisurely scenic drive, of course!

**The Perfect Itinerary (flexible, of course!):**

While you could spend days exploring this stunning valley, even a half-day drive will leave you breathless. Here's a suggested route, focusing on the highlights:

* **Start in Pienza:** This perfectly preserved Renaissance town is a must-see. Grab a coffee and a pastry at a local café, enjoying the panoramic views from the Piazza Pio II.  Wander the cobblestone streets, and perhaps even indulge in some Pecorino cheese tasting – a local specialty.

* **Follow the winding roads:**  This is where the magic happens. The roads themselves are a work of art, gently curving through rolling hills dotted with vineyards, olive groves, and those iconic cypress trees. Don't rush!  Pull over frequently to take photos, enjoy the views, and soak it all in.

* **Stop at Montepulciano:** This hilltop town boasts stunning architecture and even more incredible views.  Explore its charming streets, admire the Duomo, and consider a wine tasting at one of the many renowned wineries in the area.  The Vino Nobile di Montepulciano is a must-try!

* **Visit Bagno Vignoni:**  This unique village features a stunning thermal spring in its main square.  It's a smaller stop, but its unforgettable charm makes it worthwhile.  The contrast between the rustic architecture and the steaming water creates a truly magical scene.

* **End in San Quirico d'Orcia:**  This picturesque village is the perfect end point to your journey.   Enjoy a relaxing aperitivo, watching the sun set over the breathtaking landscape.

**Tips for the Perfect Scenic Drive:**

* **Rent a car:**  A car is essential for exploring the Val d'Orcia at your own pace.
* **Go in Spring or Autumn:**  These seasons offer pleasant temperatures and stunning scenery, with the rolling hills bursting with colour.
* **Allow plenty of time:** Don't try to cram too much into one day.  The beauty of this drive lies in its leisurely pace.
* **Pack snacks and drinks:**  You'll want to stay fueled for your journey and enjoy picnics with a view.
* **Bring your camera:**  You'll want to capture the stunning scenery at every turn.

I am horrified and so embarrassed,"This is the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me in my life and honestly probably one of the most embarrassing things I’ve ever heard happen to someone. 

I am a traveling therapist that works with kids. I was at my clients house for a home visit. The child lives with their grandmother and siblings. 

I was working with the child in a seating area that was not in the main living room. I was sitting on a couch while the child sat in a chair across from me at the coffee table. 

I was half way through the session when I started to feel like I needed to go to the bathroom and then all of the sudden it just came out and it was liquid. I asked the grandma if I could use their restroom and when I stood up I looked down on the couch and noticed there was some on the couch in a spot, so I quickly covered it with my therapy bag and went into the bathroom to see that the poop went through my pants and cardigan. I wiped it off as best I could and tried to strategically move my cardigan to cover. I found baby wipes in the bathroom and took a handful. I came back to the couch and when the grandma wasn’t looking I wiped it up and think I got it all but now I am second guessing myself. When I went to leave there was a wet spot on the couch from the baby wipe. 

I really hope that no one notices and that I cleaned it up well enough. I don’t know what to do and am so embarrassed and feel absolutely horrible. I want to crawl out of my skin and it’s the only thing I can think about. I have to go back to see them next week and I don’t know what to do? 

Grandma did mention in conversation that the child I work with’s baby sibling poops in their diaper and takes it off running around the house and sometimes this makes a mess and she has to clean it or is constantly spilling her drinks. I hope that she thinks it was from the baby or something that was on my bag like snow or something. 

Please be kind as I feel horrible for what happened, but I didn’t know what else to do in the moment. Should I have said something? What should I do when I have to go back for the next session? What do I say if she questions anything? ",1,1736566289.0,confessions,10,1.0,False

Any psychiatrists in Toronto, Canada here? 
My central nervous system was damaged beyond repair by all the drugs and severe trauma during drug trials that started in February of 2022 when my escitalopram for anxiety stopped working. Psychiatrist polydrugged me with high dose of Clonazepam and trials of Seroquel, Fetzima, Sertraline, gabapentin, escitalopram, Mirtazapine, Vilazodone and many before that. I also got really sick from COVID vaccine as always been sensitive to drugs and contracted COVID. Developed chronic nausea complete loss of appetite and upper right chest pain while on Sertraline and high dose of clonazepam. Even before testing they told me it was my anxiety not the drugs and sensitivity to them. They finally tested and found the H Pylori stomach infection in which antibiotics increased damage of my system. Chronic nausea loss of appetite and food intolerances to most all foods worse after treatment. I reacted with more pain suffering,
nausea, IBS diarrhea, IBS constipation, food comas, throat burning, welts, itchiness, passing out, pain. I remember trying pizza and fell to the ground in pain and nausea doubled over and throwing up. I pled for stomach testing. Psych and doctor kept saying anxiety. Finally had endoscopy and colonoscopy. H Pylori detected. Harsh 2 week course of amoxicillin, clarithomycin, proton pump inhibitor pantoprezoe left me incapacitated and worse off with chronic nausea and upper right chest pain. Colonoscopy removal of polyps. At this point psych had left me on 3 mgs of clonazepam. Started tapering. Would not stop. Tried the naturopathic route. Magnesium citrate, Omega 3, Gaba, L-theanine, NAC, Vitamin B and D shots as depleted. Tried homeopath who had me smelling Alba to help with nausea and another homeopathic liquid. Went to ER. Bleeding hemorrhoids from constipation again first time. Only nice
doctor. Had lost 60 lbs by then. Had Gastroparesis test with egg sandwich ate it, but after when got home passed out and couldn't lift head, drooling and started dry heaving from nausea. Could not tolerate egg, bread and mayonnaise. Referred to Internal medicine at Mount Sinai who said take Vitamin D and Proton pump inhibitors and that's it and keep your doctor during COVID. As tapering of the clonazepam continued, started to get more symptoms and intolerances and agoraphobia terror increasing. Throat burning. Smells started to bother me last year on and off. My BMs and reaction to spices on chicken, garlic from what recall and boiled eggs. The physical reaction occured before any smell. Screaming in head pain, falling down, escalated heart rate, inability to breath. Could no longer tolerate supplements, magnesium, peppermint, coconut, B vitamins, Omega 3, L-theanine, Gaba, Mastic gum. In the meantime
re psychiatrist she was the one that had left me on clonazepam high 3 mg dose which started tapering in summer of 2022. Dr. O tried me on more drugs Mirtazapine which reacted to by severe fibromyalgia pain ballooning of my legs and aggravation of physical fibromyalgia pain and Vilazodone which gave me severe nausea, side effects and body twitches and more anxiety. I refused to try more drugs after that and kept pleading to slow down taper so I could get my nervous system settled to try see if could get anxiety down and see if could eat again. She refused and refused. Went to addictions who didn't help with taper. Treated me like addict. During COVID no one who I saw believed or helped me due to my anxiety agoraphobia history. The threats to go psych ward started last year. I thought issues with stomach was damage from H-Pylori. Then joined benzo group where found out about MCAS - Mast Cell Activation Syndrome. I had
become intolerant to almost all supplements and meds and foods, even foods that were okay before by then. Kimchi, kombucha, miso soup. Anything msg or processed no good. Tried to find other doctor. Didn't believe me. Didn't believe about benzos, didn't believe about Mast Cells and had no advocate to back me up. Saw allergists who only did skin testing for 10 things and refused to do further as on clonazepam and thought was crazy. Was given epipen by naturopath nurse practitioner. Functional doctor specializing more in Food intolerances, histamine and MCAS, heard my story and lack of support system and told me need to go to US where more help. I was too agoraphobic and had no one to escort me or come with me. It was too late for me. Everyone just kept screaming and ingnoring me. Look at me now. The Multiple Chemical Sensitivities started gradually and sped up as tapering clonazepam. My throat started burning when psych dropped me 8%
off 1.25 mg dose of clonazepam. In the summer of 2023 the smells started to emerge more and more while trying to do brain rewiring using the Gupta program for my anxiety in park. Trees, grass, cooking, BBQ, fumes, pot. Kept tapering the benzo daily as doctor refused to slow down, so probably hit tolerance, withdrawal on it. The most dangerous and addictive and hardest drug to get off. And most painful. Supposed to take it for only 2 weeks max and not that high dose. Had/has me on it for over two years. Now is doing nothing anymore. Searched for help at Toronto Western prior, who social worker would not work with me for depression due to benzo and anxiety withdrawal. Psychopharmaceutical doctor spoke to me 50 minutes without having reviewed chart and recommended trying Sertraline again which is one drug made me sick to begin with. Said Mirtazapine should not have been tried by psych. Mentioned
staying on benzo on steady dose but did not write on report and from Pillcheck DNA drug genetic report recommended the anti psychotic cariprazine, where psych got it stuck in her head. Mount Sinai, numerous Western doctors, internal medicine social workers, psychotherapist, crisis lines, warm lines. Regular Western tests pretty much okay except one. Reacted to contrast dye body scan. Fell down. Tried some spinal flow which had worked for the person doing it, for smell sensitivities in fall of 2023. She however did not have food intolerances nor was she on a benzo and didn't suffer the severe anxiety terror I have. I stayed with husband's cousin in law who took me in for about 10 days. Even there my smells started escalating. Even before I smelled something, and was upstairs in room in house, popcorn had me on floor with nose and head inflammed in excruciating pain and unable to breath. Another time was slow cooked meat. Spinal
flow and the thought of returning back to my home had me distraught. At home reactions to food I remember Garlic hurt so much and then chicken with spices. Then my brother boiling eggs. One time was doing Gupta brain rewiring visualization. Chicken was being cooked. Even before I smelled anything, my nose brain sinus pain inflammation. Head pounding, heart rate over a hundred. Fell down staggering to get outside and away from smell. My nose forehead always inflamed in pain and throat dry now. Another time developed vertigo and fell on ground room spinning unable to get up and Jimmy talking to me while on floor and calling Angelina to try and pick me up. I have become intolerant to all volatile organic compounds of products and furniture and things and all food compounds and foods, even water chlorine fluoride hurts hurts hurts. Each day the smell intolerances to food and to VOCs are getting worse. Have developed
severe cognitive impairment and brain fog, memory loss. Have become bedbound. Severe pain fibromyalgia has escalated to epic proportions. Have fibromyalgia diagnosis from mid fifties. Inside outside everything smells. I can no longer function. I developed prolapsed hemorrhoids on top of it due to severe constipation and on and off Restoralax. One of my worse nightmares now as terrified to even contemplate surgery. Developed bowel incontinence and diarrhea explosions. Can't even tolerate the odour of own BM. Cannot sleep for over 2 years. Going through benzo withdrawal nightmare too. Convulsing, shaking, terror, fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis, joint pain, migraines, panic attacks. Nose mucus forming in nasal passages.  
Nostrils inflaming. Sinuses inflaming with severe hard lumps depending on what is in air and smell and what ate. Nose and head severe pain inflammation chronic. Chronic full body pain. Eyes dry tic on own. DPDR, internal akathesia tremors, external. 
Anhedonia. Depression terror chronic pain head nose middle forehead. Foods was eating Oatmeal, organic frozen blueberries, lactose free milk, white rice, mortadella, bun started reacting to as well. Bedbound, housebound unable to function. Everyday worse. Have lost 85lbs now since spring of 2022 most have been since this fall as smell escalation in this house and outside. Lost 4 pounds in Humber River psych ward ER. No one believed me or understands how severe I am. Yelling at me. Brother's home smells like a perfume factory. Coffee oregano spices chili cheese skunk wood formaldehyde. I look like anorexic death. They say I have to deal with it and plug your nose so you can eat. If I could tolerate smell and could tolerate food why wouldn't I eat? Being told by everyone that others have to eat. I am not stupid. Pled and pled for them to find me place alone. Succumbed to psych addictions hospital. Mistake Mistake Mistake. Smells killing me.
Food hurts me more physically. Drug making me more sick. Dr. X my demise. Said have to live with smells and yelled at me that doesn't want to hear about not being able to do laundry or eat or smells even though exchange with Dr. Z of Environmental Sensitivities. Told her was given a Raspberry scented razor and the smell hurt me so bad to get it off. Citalopram nausea vomitting destroyed me. No one truly undersrands. They believe Western doctors. They also haven't a clue about benzo tolerance withdrawal at psych ward or compounded liquid benzo. This is beyond positive thinking. Over 2 years of fighting. I get yelled at and bullied. How can anyone understand? Everyone is sick of me and disbelieves me. Loss of cognition focus and repeating myself. I forget what I do from one second to the next. No proper medical help found to believe me. I am in terror. I can no longer touch things either. Totally OCD and Baking soda worked for a bit, but now that isn't working all the time. Grocery deliveries and packaging smell, clothes smell, laundry products, soap. I can feel the pain and react and smell everything in existence especially food compounds and chemical compounds and volatile organic compounds. I smell everything downstairs and up here is horrible. I can smell gas sulphur from furnace and stove. I can smell chlorine in water. I can't find products to wash properly as everything has salicylates and chemical smell. Everything and everywhere smells. It's unexplainable. It's not normal. And they say try olanzapine. A drug on my report with bad and also inconclusive results which is also an excitatory anti-psychotic drug. Excessive activation of glutamate receptors may excite nerve cells to their death in a process now referred to as excitotoxicity.
Doctors have been insisting I am psychotic and pushing me to take anti-psychotics. I changed doctors. Dr. S. western medicine
doctor. He doesn't  believe or understand either. He doesn't know. He doesn't understand anything but Western. Taken to ER where they put me on 72 hour psychiatric hold to try and see if can get admitted for other help too. Was told I have to try and eat. It doesn't work that way. It doesn't work that way. It hurts and smells. It was horrible in there. Horrible. Big security. Could not have any of my food and medicine. Everything smelled. Crying in room all night in excruciating pain. Would not give me medicine. Watched me on camera. Opened door when in bathroom trying to wash. Psychiatrist met didn't know what is wrong. He said not psychosis but find functional medicine doctor who was helping his wife for long COVID. Recommended an anti-psychotic olanzapine that others think should try but that will not rid me of what is going on. Unfortunately they don't understand this is not a fix. An anti psychotic will make me worse. Even the Case PSW worker told me that. I told psychiatrist this
drug was not in my green possible work zone. It will only make things more toxic. Psych at H R hospital said up to me if to stop benzo taper. I don't believe will help anything at this point. My freak of nature illness is progressing smells. No one has any idea and is just tired of me. The psychiatrist said re food intolerances go back to ER and other issues. I said I was there for that too. He is only prescriber who recommends drugs which drug companies pay them big bucks to prescribe. Would not admit me as has no idea what is wrong. Mentioned his wife had long COVID and sort of understood alternative medicine which couldn't find help for. This olanzapine drug is actually more excitatory not calming to brain and not good for Benzo withdrawals too. I already have too much glutamate will give me more anxiety, joint pain, nerve muscle pain panic cause more cognitive impairment, permanent memory loss sedation, inability to move and
balance, tardive dyskenisia, constipation, permanent movement disorders. No one is listening to me. No one believes me. I am petrified.  I am in pain and scared. I want this to end to go in peace. They tell me deal with the smells. Try having bleach up your nose 24/7. I have been yelled at called unappreciative, disrespectful told I am crying wolf. I know everyone is sick of me. I am petrified. I can't live like this. I can't live like this. I need someone to put me out of my misery. I need out of this house away so my baby doesn't see me anymore and give them their life back. Mine is over. Not being negative. I know what this is. I can't be here. I have lost all control and independence due to my terror agoraphobia benzo tolerance withdrawal, smells of food , cooking, volatile organic compounds, severe chronic pain fibromyalgia. They think am not severe. I made it to appointments. I managed to fake it out of fear. Not anymore. Cannot even wipe
hands on towels or paper towel. Cannot even bath, wash hair. Water soap hurts. Gum teeth inflamed bleeding. Pieces grow hard and come out of nose. Have no clothes that will fit me or tolerate as everything has smell. Can't buy clothes as smell. Even blanket and unwashed sheet smell of chlorine now. Afraid to wash as will smell of washer smell of other clothes and mold and scents. Had some help but now, no one can help me and they think they know what is going on, but they don't and I am a freak of nature. I will stand firm that along with anxiety and agoraphobia caused by benzo dependency tolerance tapering withdrawal, I am intolerant to food amines, histamines, salicylates, glutamates, oxalates, lectins, sulfates, thiols, nightshades...and the smells of ALL food, cooking as well as intolerance to ALL of them. Throat burns, nose runs throbs, pain, head nose, reaction, gas, fibro, joint migraine pain. I am intolerant to water and sweet burn
of clonazepam too.  Burns throat and nose.
I am intolerant to all Volatile organic compounds gas, chlorine, electricity formaldehyde, wood, fabric, plastics, pesticides, essential oils, bleach, cologne, the list is endless scented and unscented stuff.
I barely sleep. Have become totally OCD as everything has a smell.
I cannot go into cupboards, touch anything in them, wash, clean, cook. Can't touch anything as smells sweet or of wood or whatever fabric. Masks smell too and don't help.





I can no longer remember things because of the chronic inflammation and brain fog as this rare disease progressing. My gums are inflammed and bleeding. Chronic nausea upper right chest pain stomach burning back. Terrified to do anything. Am in severe terror and pain and suffering. Was crying from hospital as need proper help from somewhere or just need peace soon. But have rare disease. Taken to psych next
where I am suffering and drugged and become more  terrorized. Doctor says have to learn and live with smells and overcome depression. Mentioned ECT. Psychiatrist will not let me leave if voluntary. Chose to use Olanzapine over ECT. Broken promises re no psych ward and to spend rest of my days in here. First psychiatrist was nasty. There are no rights for someone like me to decide my fate as no Western physical diagnosis. My story is unbelievable. I don't even believe it. Advanced Care Wishes can't help me. They tell me plug your nose. Multiple Chemical Sensitivities compounds are absorbed through skin, eyes, mouth, ears and nose. So whatever you are intolerant to, it still hits you.
The smell of coffee kills me and oregano and spices and cold cuts and cheeses and preserved food and pizza and bananas and chili and canned foods and peanut butter and gas oven cooking. I can't even go into fridge or freezer to touch stuff. I can't touch food or
plates or wash. Everywhere smells  The food I eat hurts and smells. Dry eyes, dry mouth, akathesia, tinnitus, joint osteoarthritis pain and fibromyalgia pain. Can barely walk. Eyes can't open. Dry like sand. Mouth dry. Nose hurts.  Can't remember anything. Repeat myself. You've heard it all before. Got stuck in women's unit of hospital. Food I eat react to. I am so embarassed. I can't interact with anyone. Live in hospital gown. I eat and due to prolapsed hemorrhoids have explosive BMs to food here. Intolerances as the food is also processed. Am intolerant of everything. Now with drug become constipated too. Doctor wants me to attend groups and live life with smells. Can't have baking soda. Not that it works. Clothes smell like electricity. Water hurts. Shower smells like scents. Whole hospital smells. Am so weak. Can't eat. Can't breath. Everyone hates me. Some nice nurses but no one gets it. Dr. X turned out to be horrible psychiatrist. Telling me
today to go shopping for clothes and do laundry and go out to bakery. Pushing drugs. Telling me to go visit Dr. O's office if have to. Citalopram nausea vomitting killing me. Even pharmacist doesn't understand. Benzo killing me. Benzo Induced Neurological Dysfunction. Smells worsening every minute. Bedbound again. Told off by Dr. X and all to pick drugs. Told them can't tolerate. Told them can't handle nausea and vomitting. They said get used to it. My body never worked like that and depression is from painful Multiple Chemical Sensitivities and food intolerances which everyone thinks a drug will help calm my nervous system down. I have damage. Big psych pharma caused the damage. I can't bear this physical pain and suffering anymore. I can't. I don't want to. They don't understand I don't want to. I am not negative. They have no clue of my suffering. They have no clue and no one ever will. A terrified brain doesn't operate the human body effectively. Down 85lbs and counting completely bedbound from pain and MCS and food intolerances and weakness. No one is helping me. I can barely function.
November 30, 2024 have regressed at home in dungeon to epic proportions. Diagnosed with severe life threatening multiple chemical sensitivities. Everything smells. Cannot tolerate any food. Cannot tolerate any odours and VOCS inside or outside home. The pain and nostril inflammation is like no other. My underarms reek of onions. I can't tolerate my own smells. I am bedbound and incapacitated and all food water products clothes materials anything and everything medicine vitamins supplements etc. I eat and react and suffer. Can't use toothpaste. Others eat or bath I react. Formaldehyde wood feces mold urine leg bag latex colognes soaps. Eyes are dry as sand. Red. Right one ticcing. Throat gets irritated. Nose pours when eat. Central forehead hurts. I am in benzo tolerance withdrawal as well as Olanzapine. I barely
sleep and when I do whatever time, I wake up shaking in terror in burning fibromyalgia pain usually around same time. Initially congested. Get severe itchiness on groin and body. Rash. Fall into food comas. Hard pieces form in nose. Eventually come out. I fluctuate between being too hot and too cold. Brain fogged. Can't touch anything. Can't do anything. Upper right chest pain. Have to take Restoralax in order to BM. Then get explosive. Have prolapsed hemorrhoids and skin tags down there. Can't tolerate that odour. No one believes me no one believes me no one believes me. Been abandoned and abused. Yelled at. Ignored. Kicked to the curb. Will be moving to basement dungeon that is cold moldy gas formaldehyde musty all alone to suffer the rest of my days or will be put in psych ward and polydrugged further and destroyed and looked at as a freak. Masks respirators nothing works for me. Nothing. I can't do this anymore. Why do people with
cancer get to go with dignity. I am not mental. This has destroyed me. I have no one who loves me or will help advocate for me for anything anymore. Telling me to go to hospital ER. Last time got formed. Nightmare. If I get formed this time I am done. Psychiatrists only go by textbook re drugs and tapering. They don't believe anything out of the box. Doctors as well. They know nothing about chronic rare illnesses especially what is going on with me. They don't know about benzo tolerance withdrawal and now Olanzapine. I cannot tolerate any food and smells. I have no safe foods. I eat and fall into severe internal akathesia panic for hours and hours. Can't cook can't clean can't wash. I just want to go in peace. Can't eat breath do nothing anymore. Bedbound locked in since COVID. Can't live or exist like this. I want MAID but need psych who believes me. Due to not tolerating food mine has deemed my psychotic over phone. Destroyed life. That diagnosis was vetoed.

This go around of sobriety has been a cake walk since I haven’t taken it on as an identity change. I am no longer a drinker. It’s that plain and that simple. I no longer drink alcohol anymore because I simply don’t want to. 

I was happily volunteered as a cook for my church’s upcoming meatfare coffee hour. It’s a pretty big honor and I’m looking forward to being able to provide a nice meal for my community before we head into Lenten fasting. Anyways, a buddy of mine said he’d help me with smoking some of the meats so we were texting the game plan for meal prep. Then he asked me, “More importantly, what kind of beer should I buy for us to drink while we’re waiting on the pork to smoke?” 

This was the first time in a while that a question about my (lack of) drinking made me feel self-conscious. Perhaps it’s because this buddy and I had a lot of bonding and time spent together with beers. There’s a lot of mutual respect between us and our wives, so I really wasn’t worried about him judging me. I think if anything, I didn’t want him to feel uncomfortable. So I said that I recently tried out an elimination diet (aka sobriety) and found that alcohol was causing some health issues for me. Granted, it was all true but I still felt bad about not being more transparent. He was totally cool about it. I guess I just wish I could have been too.

Talked to her a few times (somewhat awkwardly but I made it happen somehow), and after I asked her out, she said yes to me. Pretty surprised because I've talked to this girl a select few times and she barely knows me. Grateful that she gave me a chance. Thinking about going out for coffee because I don't want to spend a bunch of money [yet].

But here is my dilemma. I have problems with talking to some people because I'm pretty good at the start of a conversation. Quite an gregarious luminary if I describe myself correctly. But when the easy stuff is over and I get the first 15 mins of a date done. I like to make conversation about things that people aren't really into. Like fancy wines, poetry, art maybe. Quite a renaissance guy. Is it a good idea to start talking with a girl about that? I can talk about lower leveled things like the typical person but I like just talking to people about refined tastes. Even mathematics and conspiracies. But I don't think that girls (or anyone) likes when I babble about potentially the warping of space and how non-Euclidean dimensions could make up the fourth dimension by mutating reality to such, so I leave that out a lot.

But still a good idea? Should I stick to low leveled things for now and build my way up, or try to talk and see if she is interested. Thank you everyone. Should mention that I'm in 10th grade and 16 rn. ",0,1736565676.0,dating_advice,3,0.5,False

1hymt2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1hymt2a/roadkill/,Roadkill,"Raven walked through town whipping her black and purple/pink combo scene/emo hair while grimacing, she was full of angst and was walking back from a resturaunt on a cloudy day, shops and warehouses along with apartment houses surrounded her. Raven noticed that there were many scavengers in the sky, vultures and crows, she enjoys looking at birds, even less ""delightful"" ones. Raven daydreamed during her walk, the resturant had ambient mood lighting and was almost empty, she also had a somewhat large meal so it made her drowzy. She stopped at one street on the way to her home because she saw Vultures picking at mud soaked roadkill, she was uncomfortable. Since the mood got dark already, she put a video about true crime on her cell. 

Edward Williams was in his office space at work on one cloudy sunset, he was working on the computer and looking through some printed papers. His coworker Felicia told him if she should fetch him some Coffee from the coffee machine they had at the side of their office. ""I would love some coffee, put whip cream, thanks Alicia"", .... ""it's Felicia"" she said while laughing and she went off, she walked briskly across the office, giving everyone smiles on the way, little did she know she spoke her last words in existance. A man in a Pharoh costume that looked like Anubis plunged a sharp object, made of steel into her chest, the blood rushed down her office skirt down to her light blue heels. Everyone in the office was screaming and trying to flee, the stampede of people's shoes panicing trying to leave crushed Edward and 3 other employees to death: Victoria Simmons, Adam Shimmering, and David Rodrigez. The Egyptian figure took away Felicia's bright future and the life of 4 other people indirectly. Victoria Simmons had crushed glasses, the shattered pieces pierced her eyes, she layed dead with her her bun and a pool of blood around her. 

Raven was spooked by that true crime video, she looked over her shoulder, frightened about a masked shape ready to drain the life from her as well. She knew she was fine but she was really shaken up. Raven walked quickly, along the way she saw her friend and stopped to speak for a few minutes. Veronica Jones said ahe missed the bus by a few seconds because she stopped to tie her shoelace, ""the butterfly effect didn't favor me this time"" she jokingly said to Raven, it was a concept they spoken about on a few occasions. Raven then waved at her and left. Raven stopped at a red light, wandering, looking at the start of the sunset. Raven then was crossing the street when suddenly a very fast car hit her and killed her within 2 minutes of agony. The car had fled and before paramedics arrived vultures feasted on her corpse, ripping out her intestines with their beaks.",2,1736565616.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I've had a bad cold for a few days that knocked me out. I woke up a couple hours later. Daily update for you lovely people. Outside for a smoke ten minutes before they close the doors at 11:00. Laid on previously mentioned cot with a nice warm blanket. More reddit. Sleep.

Woke up at a quarter to five this morning. Plugged in my phone. Kept an eye on it expecting somebody that was up to eyeball it looking to steal it. Not a one. Outside with the old man crew for a morning cigarette. Luckily I'm a member. 😁

I guess a couple guys butted heads before I got out there. Tougher of the two who backed away, ""I got nothing to lose man. Nothing."" Some young guy who works here in the other guys face. ""I'm a part of this! I'll put you out! You wanna be on the street this morning? I'll put you to walking."" Dude kept his mouth shut. Young guy couldn't let it go. More idle threats.

'What a douche. This guy has no business working with homeless people. Wrong temperament.' Smoke. Listen to old black guy say, ""Goddamnit! Knock it off! You got me out here cussing early in the morning."" Problem squashed.

Back inside. Guys going around quietly putting new sleeping bags next to everyone's cots. Grab one when offered. 'Good to forty-five degrees. Mine's probably the same or better. And it's a mummy bag. This one's square opening. After that twenty six degree night I'm good with what I got. Might take it. Might give it to someone. Don't have any room on the pack to put it...' Check phone. 88%. 'Nice!.'

Back to cot for a bit. Go get phone and charger. Reddit. Weather. Check temps in this part of the country looking for where to go to stay warm. Northern Florida. Might go into southern Georgia next looking for work. Lights on.

""Everybody wake up. We're gonna cook breakfast. Help us out. Come get a trash bag and put your blankets and pillows  you're not taking with you in the bag."" 'I'll wait for traffic to die down.'

Dude working here shows up with packs of smokes to hand out. Hands out single cigs to whoever needs one. This was done several times today. Also I was told some of the women working here made store runs for people that had money and needed some things.

Sausage, eggs, and pancakes for breakfast. 'I love breakfast food.' ""Breakfast food? This is my new favorite restaurant."" Smiles from the women serving us. Seconds. 

""Everybody? I've got a quick announcement. We're gonna stay open one more night. It's cold and raining out there. We're gonna go another night."" Someone else, ""Anybody who wants to go downtown get your stuff together and come see me. Anybody going to such and such get your stuff together."" Groups leaving. A couple more places to go. A couple more groups gathered.

Up to counter. ""You guys got any coffee?"" ""Here you go."" 'Cream amd sugar even. Sweet!' They had coffee going all day.

Barely ambulatory dude next to me, ""Can we stay here today?"" ""Good question. I'll go find out."" Affirmative. Give dude good news. 'Nice! Get to chill in the warm dry shelter.' Numbers have dropped by two thirds. Old black guys behind me, ""It's miserable out there. I ain't goin' nowhere until I have to."" I look back, ""Yeah fuck that."" Nods in return. 

Phone. Sleep. Phone. Wash, rinse, repeat. Lunch. Chilli dogs. Drinks in the coolers anyone can get anytime they want. Sodas, gatorade, bottled water. Snacks passed out between meals. Your choice. Good selection. I spy a Pepsi down deep in a cooler. 'Score! I'll keep in mind they're down low.' 

Up to counter. Talk with a preacher for a bit. ""Is there anyway I can get into my stuff and grab a pack of smokes? I didn't prepare for two nights since I was told we were out in the morning."" ""What""s your number?"" ""138"" ""Wait here."" Must've found out my gear is heavy. ""Come through that door and come back here."" Go back into staff only area. Open bag one of two. Smokes. Headphones. Tie up bag. ""I've been through a few of these programs like this over the years. I gotta say you guys are doing it right. You're paying attention."" ""I decided I don't want the government involved. They'll want to tell me how to spend the money. I tell everyone who donates money I'll take it on the condition they let me decide how it is spent."" ""You're doing good work."" ""We're always looking for ways to improve."" Back to cot.

Another preacher starts talking about how several people that were in this cold weather shelter last year didn't make it through the year. ""What can we do to help you guys get off the streets?"" 'I've got answers for this.' Hand up. He locks on me. Hands me a microphone.

""You're gonna have to start with a housing first aproach. And one that doesn't toss you out for every little mistake. We're human. We're gonna make mistakes. We need stability we know we can count on."" He tries to tell me his ideas are a better way. ""I've been homeless for the better part of thirty years. Unless you've been homeless you have no idea what we need. We're all different. We have different needs."" Agreement noises all around the room. A couple black guys come up next to me. One on his cot to my left. One standing respectfully near my cot on my right. Move my coat and blanket over. ""Here brother have a seat.""

Preacher trying to change subject and convince me his ideas are better. ""If you really want to help us you're gonna have to give us stability that we've never had. You're gonna have to be in our corner backing us up no matter what mistakes we make."" ""We can't do that..."" Goes on to try and explain to me why he can't or won't/his idea is better.

""The other thing we run into a lot is jaded social workers that are looking for a reason to not help us. You're gonna have to get over that. Every. Day."" More bullshit excuses. Tries to change subject again.

Dudes on either side of me put in their two sense with some anecdotal evidence. Preacher gently changes subject. More excuses. Goes on his own diatribe. Starts preaching.

'I'm out. Time to leave respectfully and go smoke.' Coat on. Outside. Ex tweaker girl out there, ""You can't tell me who I have to forgive! I tell me who to forgive! This is my house!"" Points to herself. ""I decide who lives here!"" ""You're right.""

A guy I ran into at the counter follows me out. I knew with one look earlier this guy's highly intelligent. Him, ""You're completely right man."" ""That guy didn't want to listen. He just changed the subject. He wants to do what he thinks we need, not what we need."" ""It always ends up with the sales pitch."" ""Yeah. No doubt."" The three of us call him on his bullshit amongst ourselves and a couple cigarettes.

Dude and  I talk for a while. He's doing the same thing I am. Looking for work. Has a bit of savings left to ride on for a little while. Good dude. Back inside. 

Phone. Back to counter. Preacher, ""I appreciate you talking to me."" ""It's good we have a dialog, even if we don't agree. This is how we'll solve this problem"" ""You're right."" We talk for a bit about differing points  of view. Some agreement between us. ""You guys got any cold medicine?"" ""Yeah. Follow me."" 

Theraflu daytime. Feeling better. Out cold. Wake up right before dinner. Good but one entree hasn't been heated to temp. 'I don't want to deal with food poisoning tomorrow on the road. I'll just skip this.' Lasagna, salad and garlic bread were great. Seconds. Plenty of drinks. More snacks, and ice cream sandwiches later.

Preacher introduces me to a guy who's a builder. Brief chat. He gets my number. Later preacher introduces me to a guy that helps homeless with a place to stay. Also gets them to work and back. ""I require a drug test twice a week, sermons four days a week, and $100 a week. Let these guys know if that's something you want to do.""

I'm on the fence. I don't need a sermon four days a week. But I'm leaving it open. I'll see how I feel about it in the morning. 

Then tonights sermon starts...

These guys love to yell. That's ther shtick. Can't just calmly give their message. Literally yelling so loud about their cherry-picked version of the bible I quietly whisper, ""Shut the fuck up. Quit fucking yelling at me. I'm not a child."" More yelling about things they don't truly understand.

That settles that. I could probably play the part for a few weeks to make some money, but there's no way in hell I can stand someone yelling at me four nights a week. 

We'll see what happens in the morning with the builder, but I'm most likely gonna get a ride back to the walmart on the highway I need, and head for warmer weather.",33,1736565438.0,vagabond,1,1.0,False

With the competition moving to the East Coast for the first time ever, and the cash prize being raised to an unprecedented half a million dollars, this season of Hell’s Kitchen was already shaping up to be one of the most intensely contested yet, but then, Chef Ramsay revealed that in another first, the competition was going international, as a team of American chefs would face off against a team of chefs from the UK, bringing this centuries-old rivalry to a head in the ultimate cook-off. After dividing up the twenty chefs into their teams, it was time for the annual signature dish challenge to begin. 

When it came time to score the dishes, Team UK blasted out of the gate early to a dominant 21-9 lead at the midway point, with each chef scoring either a four or a five, while the Americans struggled to get anything going. Just as it looked like Team UK would run away with the first challenge of the season though, Team USA staged a massive rally, with an unbelievable four consecutive chefs earning a five on their dish, putting the Americans in position to win the challenge. But, thanks to a strong dish from Connor, and a disappointing effort from Lewis, Team UK would take home a narrow 31-30 victory, earning the first reward of the new season: a day on the famed Atlantic City Boardwalk. Meanwhile, Team USA was left with the punishment of cleaning both kitchens, and while some chefs tried to make amends, it didn’t take long before tensions flared between others. 

Now, with both teams back in the kitchen, and the opening night service just minutes away, which team will step up and claim the first dinner service victory of the season? Find out right now, on the second part of the two-part season premiere of Hell’s Kitchen: USA vs. UK…

**And now, the continuation of Hell’s Kitchen…**

Team UK returned to Hell’s Kitchen to find Team USA wrapping up their punishment, with Freddy taking the opportunity to ask the Americans if they had fun, to which Mack replied that he would have a lot more fun winning service tonight. With both teams clearly locked in, Ramsay said it was time to start prep/.

In the blue kitchen, Nora, Rosalie, and Lewis were prepping apps, Phillip and Howard were prepping fish, Sidney and Iris were prepping garnish, and Tony, Paige, and Mack were setting up meat. On appetizers, Rosalie quickly became concerned by the fact that Nora and Lewis didn’t really seem to know what they were doing, as they were both asking a lot of questions and clearly letting her do most of the work. She would say in her confessional that she didn’t mind lending a hand, but at a certain point, they were just using her. Meanwhile, Nora was still pissed at Lewis for losing the challenge, as she told him that he needed to step up his game in service. Lewis reminded her again, that he wasn’t the one who served a dish with an onion volcano, so maybe she should look in the mirror. Nora said in her confessional that she definitely wasn’t a racist, but people with horrible attitudes and low talent like Lewis made her understand why some people were. Rosalie pleaded with them to just stay focused on prepping, because there was a lot of work to do and not a lot of time, with both Nora and Lewis still seeming more interested in continuing their feud, but they would grudgingly get back to work for now. Meanwhile, Phillip and Howard seemed to have a decent rapport on fish, as they were working together to prep everything, though Howard said in his confessional that while Phillip was a cool guy, he was going to have to do a hell of a better than his signature dish if they were gonna win this service. On garnish, Iris said it was so exciting to be able to cook for her hometown crowd, as it was a dream come true for her. Sidney said that was great, but she could really use some help, because she was doing most of the work right now. Iris did start helping out more eventually, but worked very slowly, much to Sidney’s frustration, however, she kept her head down and continued to carry most of the load. On meat, while Paige and Tony seemed focused on getting the station set up, Mack was more focused on getting them all psyched up, as he said the Brits were way too big for their britches already, and he couldn’t wait to kick some ass. Paige simply laughed and said in her confessional that Mack was something else. 

On Team UK’s side, Saoirse, Dylan, and Jack were prepping apps, Freddy and Madeleine were setting up fish, India and Gordon were setting up garnish, and Connor, Esmé and Beatrice were setting up meat. It wouldn’t take long for Dylan to start dividing up the responsibilities, which annoyed Jack a bit as he said in his confessional that Dylan just assumed he was in charge without asking anyone, while Saoirse said in her confessional that she didn’t mind being given a clear task, as she wanted all of her thoughts to be on delivering a strong service. Dylan said in his confessional that he knew how to run a kitchen, and Ramsay was going to see that apps was the best section tonight due to his leadership. On fish, Freddy still seemed to be taking a more lax approach, even humming to himself, with Madeleine saying in her confessional that Freddy was one of those guys who was good enough to afford to be naive about his weaknesses, and he needed to realize that before reality smacked him in the face. Freddy said in his confessional that he was worried about Dylan running apps like a dictatorship. On garnish, Gordon would immediately tell India to just let him handle this, as he was the most experienced chef here, and she was the youngest, so for now, she should just try to learn as much as she could from him. India said in her confessional that it wasn’t the first time she’d been condescended to by chefs who were older than her, and there was often no point trying to argue with them. With that, she would simply nod and say that she just wanted to be as helpful as possible. On meat, Connor and Esmé quickly seemed to be on the same page with each other, but Beatrice, much like Dylan on apps, would immediately start to assert herself as the leader, though Esmé would push back on that, saying that no one was entitled to that role without the three of them talking it over, while Beatrice shot back that someone had to do it, and since she owned a restaurant, she was clearly the most qualified. Connor would interject and tell Beatrice that Ramsay said their past accomplishments didn’t matter here, and they all had a blank slate. Eventually, the three of them would manage to work out an arrangement, and soon, Team UK was ready for service. 

Ramsay called Marino over and told him to open Hell’s Kitchen for the first service of the season. 

**Dinner Service**

As the doors opened, guests streamed into Hell’s Kitchen Atlantic City for the first season ever to be held on the east coast. Notable attendees included former winners Ken Morimoto, Melody Fraser, and LaMont Murray, who were all seated together, and a pair of legendary former athletes in U.S Olympian Michael Phelps and English soccer player David Beckham. With a packed house all eager to receive a world class meal, it wasn’t long before tickets began to make their way back to both kitchens. 

In the blue kitchen, Team USA was looking to the trio of Nora, Rosalie and Lewis on apps, along with Phillip and Howard on fish, to get them off to a strong start. On the first ticket, though, Ramsay barely got any response from apps aside from Rosalie, as he told them to wake up and smell the coffee. However, communication issues would immediately set in as Nora and Lewis couldn’t agree on how long their risotto would take, and neither of them were in sync with Rosalie, resulting in multiple different times and no one being sure of when to walk. Nora would eventually bring up the risotto despite Lewis’ protests, where it was revealed to be undercooked, and as if that wasn’t enough, Phillip’s scallops were completely stone cold raw. Despite Howard’s scallops and Rosalie’s risotto being perfect, Ramsay ordered the ticket restarted, because he wasn’t opening this season with an incomplete ticket. On the second attempt at the ticket, however, despite Rosalie and Howard again serving perfect risotto and scallops and Phillip fixing his scallops, Nora brought up a burnt risotto, with a furious Ramsay showing her that it was stuck to the pan, and after seeing her crack a smile, ask if she thought it was funny that they were just wasting time and food at this point, with Nora denying it and saying she thought it was funny that Lewis was screwing up her risotto and letting her take the fall for it. Lewis would protest to this, saying that Nora was just looking for someone to pin the blame on. Ramsay told the two of them to get it the fuck together right now, because he was not going to spend the entire service on one ticket. Howard would finally step up vocally and try to work out where everyone was time wise, with Ramsay saying that finally someone was showing some initiative here. With Howard leading the way, Team USA sent up their third attempt at the first ticket, with Ramsay thanking Howard for stepping up and telling Marino to serve that. In his confessional, Howard said that he was here to help his team win, and he would work with anyone he needed to in order to make that happen.

In the red kitchen, Team UK were hoping that Saoirse, Dylan, and Jack on appetizers could coordinate with Freddy and Madeleine on fish to get them off to a strong start. On the first ticket, Ramsay got a good response from everyone, and right away, both Freddy and Dylan would start calling out times over each other, immediately creating confusion, with Madeleine telling them to slow down because she needed to know what the hell was going on. With nothing coming out after several minutes, Ramsay asked what the hold up was, with Dylan blaming Freddy for asking for more time, even though his risotto was ready, wh. Ramsay said they didn’t need five people shouting over each other, and all they needed was one time for the entire ticket. With Dylan refusing to budge, Freddy reluctantly backed down, and soon, Team UK’s first attempt at the first ticket was on its way to the pass…where it was accepted, as Ramsay told Marino to serve it and told Team UK to not start pissing themselves now. Dylan said in his confessional that as long as Freddy stayed out of his way, there should be no issues with him leading the team to victory. Unfortunately, the very next ticket would see Jack serve undercooked capellini and Saoirse serve undercooked risotto, with Ramsay telling them both to wake up. Things wouldn’t get any better on the next attempt, as while Saoirse fixed her risotto, Jack again served undercooked capellini. At that point, Dylan would tell Jack to just let him handle it, as he said in his confessional that clearly he was going to have to do this himself. Jack said in his confessional that Dylan’s ego was just growing and growing by the minute, and sooner or later it was going to bite him in the ass. With Dylan now cooking Jack’s capellini, Team UK was finally able to send their second ticket out. On the third ticket, though, apps completely fell apart again, with Jack serving overcooked capellini, and Dylan serving a soupy risotto. Ramsay berated them both as he told Jack that if he did that again, he could fuck off upstairs, and told Dylan that if he was going to step up and lead, he’d better damn well lead by example, telling them both that he was just asking for a little fucking consistency. Freddy said in his confessional that it was nice to see Dylan eat some humble pie. Dylan did manage to correct his risotto, while Jack finally served acceptable capellini, and with Freddy and Madeleine in sync on the fish station, Team UK finally managed to get their third table out. 

In the blue kitchen, Team USA had finally sent out their first table, but was now looking to start building momentum on appetizers. Unfortunately, it wouldn’t take long for Nora and Lewis to reignite their rivalry, with Lewis telling Nora that her risotto was burnt, and her telling him to just fuck off and leave her alone. Lewis called her a joke and said if she couldn’t see that it was burnt, she shouldn’t even be here. Ramsay was getting increasingly annoyed as he already had the scallops and capellini and said he was just waiting for one risotto. Lewis shrugged and said if she wanted to fuck over the team, that was here choice, with Nora immediately saying it was ready, and bringing it up to the pass. Ramsay was appalled by the risotto as he said the rice was practically burnt to a crisp, and there was no way he could serve that, as he asked Nora if she had functioning eyes and taste buds. Nora would then blame Lewis as she said he was the one who told her to serve it. Lewis replied that Nora was determined to make a fool of herself and he wasn’t gonna stand in her way. Ramsay was beyond pissed, as he said that they may have thought this was funny, but to him, they were the joke, as he told them both to fuck off back to the dorms. As the duo left the kitchen, Nora said in her confessional that she had everything under control until Lewis decided to start sticking his nose where it didn’t belong. Meanwhile, Lewis said in his confessional that he didn’t come here for some white chick who couldn’t cook to treat him this way. With Nora and Lewis gone, Rosalie was now alone on appetizers, as she said in her confessional that as difficult as it was, she felt more comfortable now than with Nora and Lewis constantly bickering beside her. Unfortunately, Team USA’s problems weren’t over, as on the next ticket, despite Howard serving perfect scallops and Rosalie nailing two risottos, Phillip served undercooked scallops, as he told Ramsay that these stoves just didn’t cook like the ones he was used to, with Ramsay asking him if he was blaming the stove now. Phillip denied it, and fortunately was able to recover on his next attempt. With Rosalie and Howard now doing most of the heavy lifting and communicating well with each other, appetizers were finally leaving the blue kitchen with something approaching consistency, as Ramsay said if he would’ve known these two could do the job themselves, he would’ve kicked out Nora and Lewis a lot sooner. Howard said in his confessional that he already felt like he and Rosalie made a good team, and was hopeful this was the start of better things to come.

In the red kitchen, Team UK was hoping to put their inconsistent start on apps behind them, but that objective got off to a shaky start when Saoirse served a bland risotto, while Freddy served rubbery scallops, with Saoirse kicking herself in her confessional for such a basic mistake. Both of them were able to bounce back, but on the very next ticket, Ramsay called them both over again…to tell them that the scallops and risotto were perfect, and he wanted to see that standard upheld all night. Freddy said in his confessional that his mates called him FredEx because he always delivers, and he was planning on living up to that, while Saoirse was excited to get a compliment from Ramsay in her confessional, as she said it gave her a massive boost of confidence. Unfortunately, on the next ticket, Jack would serve yet another undercooked capellini, as Ramsay said a culinary instructor who struggled to make pasta terrified him, and told Jack that class was dismissed and to fuck off back to the dorms. Jack was devastated in his confessional, as he said he knew he was capable of so much better than that, and the nerves of working on the line for the first time in years just got to him. Back in the kitchen, with Jack gone the remaining four chefs did seem to finally start finding some consistency, with Dylan and Saoirse serving perfect risotto and capellini, while Freddy and Madeleine continued their nearly flawless run on fish. Madeleine said in her confessional that even though it was a rocky start, she felt like the team was settling down, and hopefully they could just cruise to the finish line from here on out. Sure enough, Team UK now had appetizers flying out to the dining room, with Dylan and Freddy seemingly setting aside their rivalry for the moment, and Ramsay said it was the first time that he felt like he had a cohesive team in either kitchen. With Team UK finally starting to click, they were soon ready to get started on entrees. 

Meanwhile, in the blue kitchen, thanks to strong leadership from Rosalie and Howard, Team USA had sent out all of its appetizers and was now moving on to entrees. With the spotlight now shifting to Tony, Paige, and Mack on meat and Sidney and iris on garnish, Ramsay would call out the first entree ticket, but immediately, there were communication mix-ups between Tony, Mack and Sidney, as each of them wanted to drive the tickets. Mack insisted that meat was his thing, and he knew what he was doing, with Tony and Sidney eventually backing down. However, Mack would prove to be very lackadaisical at consistently calling out times, leading to everyone getting confused, and Tony saying he needed to walk right now despite Mack and Paige not being ready yet. Despite Mack and Howard asking him not to, Tony would walk up his striploin, as he said he wasn’t serving Ramsay a fucked up steak. Fortunately, the strip was cooked perfectly, as was Sidney and Iris’ garnish, but Ramsay asked where the rest of the order was, with Mack, Paige and Howard being forced to admit that they were dragging on their respective stations. Howard said in his confessional that the times were all fucked up, and it seemed like both Mack and Tony were just looking out for themselves instead of the team. Mack, meanwhile, was annoyed in his confessional as he said Tony wasn’t a team player, and just because he got a five on his dish didn’t give him the right to be a Baltimore-sized dick. When the others did eventually bring their dishes up, Howard’s halibut was cooked to perfection, but Mack served raw wellington, and Paige served undercooked New York Strip. A pissed off Ramsay said that everything went back to communication, and if they weren’t talking to each other consistently, then the result was going to be shit. Tony said in his confessional that Mack may have passion, but his leadership straight up sucked, and they needed to adapt. Tony would start to take control on meat as he called out times confidently and was able to build a solid rapport with Sidney on garnish, and thanks to his strong leadership, orders were making their way out into the dining room at a very good pace. Unfortunately, the brief surge would soon come crashing down to earth once again as Iris served soupy mashed potatoes, and an overly large portion at that, while Tony served dry New York Strip, followed by rare New York Strip. Mack said that Tony acted like he was the shit, when in reality, he was just shit, period. While Tony did recover from these mistakes on his third attempt, it was clear that most of the team no longer respected his leadership, as they ignored his timings, with Howard and Sidney both trying to get in sync, however it was clear that the momentum was gone, as Phillip served raw halibut, while Mack served raw wellingtons for a second time. After yet another raw halibut from Phillip. Ramsay told him that since he’s traveled to so many countries, he should take one more trip…to the dorms, because he was done for tonight. Phillip protested, but Ramsay again told him to fuck off. Tony said in his confessional that all he wanted to do was help his team win, but they obviously didn’t want to hear what he had to say.

In the red kitchen, Team UK was now getting started on entrees, as they turned to Connor, Esmé and Beatrice on meat and India and Gordon on garnish. On the first ticket, Esmé started out leading from the meat station, but Gordon quickly cut her off and called out his own times, with neither of them seeming to want to back down. Gordon finally told Esmé to just be quiet and obedient like a good girl, with Esmé being appalled by this, and Clare having to step in and tell Gordon not to talk that way to anyone ever again if he wanted to stay in this kitchen, Gordon would reluctantly quiet down though he said in his confessional that he was tired of all these women thinking they knew better than him. With Esmé, India, Freddy and Madeleine all establishing a good rapport with each other, it wasn’t long before the first order of entrees was on its way up to the pass. As Ramsay inspected everything, he would praise the fish and meat stations for serving perfect dishes, but told Gordon and India that the wellington sauce was cold, with Gordon immediately saying that he didn’t make it. This shocked India as she asked in her confessional what happened to “just stand back and let me take care of it?”, as the replay clearly showed Gordon making the sauce. Ramsay said he didn’t care who made it, he just wanted it redone and quickly. Eventually, the sauce was accepted and the ticket went out. Beatrice also seemed determined to assert herself though, as she tried to call out her own times for the meat station, creating conflicting information between her and Esmé. As a result, the next ticket was a complete disaster, as Beatrice served raw New York strip, Esmé served undercooked Wellingtons, and Madeleine served undercooked salmon. Ramsay was furious as he said this was not what he expected from the best and brightest that the UK had to offer. While Madeleine and Esmé were able to bounce back quickly, Beatrice still chose to go on her own time and served an overcooked strip. Ramsay asked her if she would serve that shit at her restaurant, with Bea denying it, and Ramsay asking her why she was serving it here. Unfortunately, Beatrice would send up yet another raw strip, causing Ramsay to say she’d had her three strikes, and now she was out, as he told her to fuck off. As Beatrice went back to the dorms, she said in her confessional that it was BS for Ramsay to throw her out and not Esmé for being an arrogant bitch. With Esmé and Connor now alone on the station, Connor would take over the strip and finally serve up an acceptable one, and with everything else being properly cooked, the ticket seemed ready to go, however, Ramsay called out Gordon and asked him if he made this Wellington sauce, with him denying it, after which Ramsay called out India’s name…to tell her it was delicious. India said in her confessional that it was nice to have her effort acknowledged, even if it was just sauce. 

In the blue kitchen, Team USA was hoping to be able to close out service strong, but with many in the team not being receptive to Tony’s leadership, and no one else successfully stepping up and taking the mantle, the service seemed to be on the brink of falling apart. With Mack still trying to assert himself as the leader, the next ticket was already on its way up to the pass, but Ramsay called everyone over because Iris had made salmon garnish despite it not even being on the ticket, while Mack’s Wellingtons were dry and cooked to fuck. While Mack eventually served acceptable Wellingtons, and iris served the correct garnish, Ramsay told her it was burnt, and he couldn’t believe they were wasting so much time on a fucking side. After iris brought up the garnish completely raw on her next try, Ramsay told her to fuck off out, and had Rosalie step in to help Sidney out. As she went back upstairs, Iris said in her confessional that this definitely wasn’t how she wanted to start her time in Hell’s Kitchen, but she knew she could bounce back from this. With Sidney and Rosalie now on garnish, they had no problems communicating with Howard, although Mack was still inconsistent, and Sidney said in her confessional that even if no one else liked him, she would much prefer working with Tony right now, as she would finally break the team’s silence with him. In his confessional, Tony said he didn’t give a fuck what Mack thought of him, but he wasn’t letting his team lose just because Mack couldn’t get over himself. Howard said in his confessional that he still wasn’t sure about Tony, but he knew Mack wasn’t getting the job done tonight. With Tony, Sidney, Rosalie and Howard all in sync, Team USA finally seemed headed in the right direction, but Mack was still going by his own times, slowing the entire order down by several minutes, much to Ramsay’s frustration, as he already had the rest of the order right here. Once Mack finally did bring his wellingtons up, they were fortunately cooked properly, and the order went out, Despite still moving at a slower pace, Team USA would eventually send out all of their remaining tables, and complete dinner service, though Ramsay seemed far from pleased as he told them to clear down. 

In the red kitchen, Team UK was looking to send out their remaining entrees, with Esmé and Connor looking strong on meat and the fish station of Freddy and Madeleine consistently sending out food halibut and salmon, however, the main point of struggle continued to be garnish, due to Gordon still trying to assert himself over the others and drive tickets despite calling out inconsistent times. This would result in Esmé and Connor bringing up undercooked Wellingtons and New York Strip respectively, with Gordon telling them to wake up. This annoyed Connor, as he said in his confessional that Gordon was the last person who should be telling anyone to wake up. While the meat station was quickly able to recover, Gordon sent up undercooked garnish, then brushed India off when she asked if he needed help. However, he was still dragging on his garnishes, with Ramsay asking him what was so fucking difficult about cooking sides. Gordon said it wouldn’t be so hard if everyone stopped riding his ass about it, with Ramsay getting in his face and saying no one would be riding his ass if he wasn’t putting out shit, as he told him to take himself and his mouth and fuck off upstairs. As Gordon left, he said in his confessional that Ramsay just threw out Team UK’s best cook, and they were going to fall apart without him. Back in the kitchen though, everyone was visibly relieved that Gordon was finally gone, with Esmé saying in her confessional that now they finally had a team that actually wanted to work together. Ramsay would tell Dylan to get on garnish to help India out, with her saying in her confessional that Dylan had his own issues but at least he wasn’t Gordon. With them managing to get in sync with Esmé and Connor on meat and Freddy and Madeleine on fish, Team UK would finally hit their stride, and began to send out entrees at an impressive pace, with Connor saying in his confessional that even though they had their ups and downs, right now, it felt like Team UK was finally working as a singular unit. With perfect entree after perfect entree leaving the kitchen, it wasn’t long before the British chefs had served all of their remaining tables and completed service, with Ramsay saying he only wished the rest of service could’ve been as good as the final few minutes as he told them to clear down. 

**Post-Mortem**

Ramsay told the teams that tonight, he was looking for a back and forth battle between two talented teams, that he had hoped to have to decide on which team team did better than the other to pick a winner, instead all he got was inconsistency, mistakes, and what flashes of greatness he did see were quickly followed by complete letdowns. Ramsay said that in Hell’s Kitchen, just being a little less bad than your opponent wasn’t going to cut it, and since both teams disappointed him today, he wasn’t crowning a winner. Instead, he wanted both teams to go back to the dorms and return to him with the names of the two chefs they felt should leave Hell’s Kitchen tonight. 

Back in the dorms, on Team USA’s side, Howard started out by saying that obviously, they were a team and no one wanted to be that person, but in his opinion, the weak links here were clearly Nora and Lewis, and that was who he was nominating. Nora would protest loudly, as she said that Lewis was a horrible station partner and completely screwed up her risottos, then let her take the fall for them, saying it was easy for him to sit back there and not bring any food up to the pass. Lewis shot back that he told her the risottos were bad, and it was her own fault for bringing them up. Rosalie would say that this was exactly why she felt that those two should go up, because they were hurting the morale of the team. Others seemed to nod along and agree, seemingly making for an easy decision, but suddenly Mack would speak up and say that he was putting Tony up for not being a team player and having a “big ol’ ego”. Tony was stunned by this, as he said that his leadership was what started to get the ball rolling, and even though he messed up on the strip temporarily, he bounced back from it and had a strong service overall. Howard would agree with Mack though, as even though he felt Mack struggled as a leader, he felt that Tony was putting himself before the team. Others now seemed to be reconsidering their own votes, with Tony throwing his hands up and saying that if they wanted to listen to Mack and send up a strong chef instead of an actual weak link, that was their choice, and he would go outside for a private moment, where he was seen getting emotional. He would soon be joined by an unexpected person, Sidney, who had been the only one not to shut Tony out in service. Tony was visibly emotional as he told Sidney that he didn’t know how to convince the team that he was doing his best for them, with Sidney saying that Tony was passionate, but just needed to be able to reel that in at times, because she knew he was a great cook, and the team should have given him a chance to keep leading. Tony thanked Sidney for supporting him as the two hugged it out. 

On Team UK’s side, the debate would begin with Esmé saying it was only fair for the three who got kicked out: Jack, Beatrice, and Gordon, to be considered first. Most of the other seemed okay with this, but the three chefs themselves clearly were not, with Jack saying that he didn’t deserve to be lumped in with Gordon and Beatrice, as this competition meant so much to him, with him planning to use the prize money for his culinary students. Dylan shot back that this wasn’t the time for sob stories, and Jack already screwed up once with his signature dish and now in service, and no amount of crying would change that. Jack asked Dylan if he could just not be a dick for two seconds, with Dylan harshly asking in return if Jack could cook just one capellini properly. Before things could escalate any further, Madeleine cut in and said that she felt that Gordon was the clear weak link, and while people may not like Dylan, he was backing his words up, while Beatrice wasn’t. Beatrice said Madeleine was just defending Dylan because they were both Welsh, with Madeleine denying that, and saying it was just the truth. Dylan would then say that he was voting for Gordon and Freddy, much to the Liverpool native’s shock, as he asked how Dylan could possibly put him up over the people that got kicked out, with Dylan responding that Freddy clearly wasn’t taking this competition seriously, and it was only going to get harder from here. Madeleine then announced that she was also nominating Gordon and Freddy, This stunned him, as he said she literally just said she was nominating Beatrice, but Madeleine said that she was only calling Bea out, not making a nomination. Connor then admitted that he also had doubts about Freddy’s commitment, with Saoirse saying he was a great guy, but she agreed, with both of them saying they were voting for Gordon and Freddy. Freddy was pissed off, as he said in his confessional that he couldn’t be going home after just one day. With that, he announced that he never thought he would be the only sane man here, but he was voting for Gordon and Beatrice to go, India agreed, as she said that Freddy had a good signature dish, and other chefs did a lot worse in service, so she was going with Gordon and Beatrice as well. With no clear consensus, Team UK’s final decision remained up in the air as elimination neared.

**Elimination Ceremony**

The teams entered the dining room and lined up before Chef Ramsay, who said that he had never seen an opening night where both teams completed service yet still managed to look so disjointed, saying it felt like he had shut service down early despite them both finishing. With that, he called on Rosalie for Team USA and asked for their first nominee and why. Rosalie announced that the team had decided on…Nora, because the team felt she had a bad signature dish, a bad service, and a bad attitude. Ramsay asked for the second nominee and why. Rosalie seemed hesitant as she announced that the team had decided on…

\-

\-

\-

Tony, because the team felt he wasn’t a team player. Ramsay noted that Rosalie didn’t look entirely happy with that decision. Rosalie admitted that she personally disagreed with this decision, but was going by the team’s majority vote. Ramsay rubbed his forehead in dismay as he said he couldn’t believe that Team USA couldn’t even come to a consensus on who to send home. With that, he asked Rosalie who she personally thought should be standing up here. Rosalie said she nominated Lewis, because he had been just as bad as Nora, and the two of them were constantly fighting each other and bringing down team morale. Ramsay shook his head as he called on Dylan and asked him for Team UK’s first nominee and why. Dylan announced that the first nominee was Gordon, because he had the worst signature dish on the team, fucked up service, and just generally pissed the whole team off. Ramsay asked for the second nominee and why. Dylan announced that Team UK was nominating…

\-

\-

\-

Freddy, because it was clear he didn’t have the commitment needed to survive in Hell’s Kitchen. Ramsay was surprised they didn’t choose someone who was kicked out of the kitchen, as he asked if this was a unanimous decision, only for India to answer that it wasn’t. Ramsay was stunned, as he said he gave these teams one job, and they couldn’t even do that properly. Ramsay asked India who she nominated, with India replying that she believed Beatrice was the weakest next to Gordon. Ramsay would finally just say fuck it, and told all six chefs mentioned: Nora, Tony, Lewis, Gordon, Freddy, and Beatrice, to step forward. 

*Deliberation music*

Ramsay said he was going to make this quick, as he told each of the chefs that they had ten seconds to tell him why they deserved to stay in Hell’s Kitchen, starting with Nora.

Nora: “The only reason I am even standing here, chef, is because of Lewis. I know in my heart that those risottos woulda been perfect if I’d been alone on that station. I’m one of the strongest chefs here, you know that, I know that, and they know that. Do you know how many people I’ve had tell me how amazing my deep fried fine dining is-”

Ramsay called out time and said he asked her why she should stay, not for a fucking sales pitch. Next, he moved on to Tony, asking him why he should stay when his team clearly didn’t believe in him. 

Tony: “Chef, if my team doesn’t believe in me, if they really think I’m a weaker chef than Lewis, then I’ll take off my fuckin’ jacket right now. But I want to be here. I want this so fuckin’ bad, chef. I’m here for my family, and I’ll keep fighting as long as you’ll let me. I know I can be your next head chef.”

Ramsay decided to take him up on that offer, asking each member of the blue team if they believed Lewis was a better chef than Tony, with all of them answering no, although Mack noticeably hesitated and had to be asked a second time. Ramsay said that was an interesting response considering how everyone apparently voted. 

Lewis: “Chef, everyone here keeps givin’ me shit about the challenge. Okay, my dish lost, but I’m a fighter, chef. I don’t stay down. Tonight was just a fluke from me, and you’ll see that tomorrow if you let me stay. I have what it takes to win it all.”

Ramsay moved on to Gordon for Team UK, asking him what set him apart besides just sharing his name and home country. 

Gordon: “Chef, I don’ think it’s right for my team to put me up when you’ve got Bea and Esmé makin’ life a bitch for the rest of us. I’ve got the experience to run your restaurant, any restaurant, and no matter what they think, I know my skill is the highest on the team.”

Ramsay next asked Freddy why he should stay, when his teammates clearly felt he lacked the commitment to win the competition. 

Freddy: “Chef, my team thinks that just ‘cause I choose to smile and have fun, that I must just not give a shit. I do give a shit, chef. I wouldn’ta come all this way if I thought it was just a lark. I’m here to win, yeah. And I know I still have a hell of a lot more to offer.”

Finally, Ramsay asked Beatrice why she deserved to stay after her fiasco on the meat station. 

Beatrice: “One bad night doesn’t define me, chef. I have the experience to operate a restaurant, I have the expertise to run a brigade. If my team can’t see that, I reckon they need their bloody eyes checked, because I know I’ll still be standin’ when the dust settles.”

Ramsay addressed the six chefs standing in front of him, as he said that tonight was an absolute clusterfuck, and the worst part was, it went on after service had ended. With that said…

Ramsay: “My decision is…”

\-

\-

\-

\-

\-

Ramsay: “Tony…direct the same passion you put into that plea, into your cooking. Back in line! Freddy, Beatrice, back in line!”

As the three chefs called out returned to their teams’ Ramsay addressed the remaining three. 

Ramsay: “Nora…your signature dish was disappointing, your service was even worse, but the reason I can’t go any further with you is because it’s clear to me that you don’t want to be here. I asked you why you should stay, and you blamed your teammate and started making an advert. That tells me you're not serious. Please take off your jacket, your time is done in Hell’s Kitchen.”

Nora quickly handed Ramsay her jacket and ignored his handshake as she walked out of Hell’s Kitchen.

**Nora’s Comment**

“I think Ramsay is absolutely wrong about me. He says I’m not serious, but the truth is, he just let the strongest chef in the competition go home first. He’ll probably end up settlin’ for someone a lot worse, but that’s not my problem anymore. These boots are walkin’ out the door, Ramsay, you missed out.”

\-

After Nora’s elimination, Ramsay told both teams to fuck off, and said he was expecting a lot better tomorrow, because based on tonight, no one deserved the head chef position and cash prise at the moment. As the chefs left the dining room, several had confessionals. Mack said it was ridiculous for Tony to still be here when he was a total dick and the team agreed that he was a cancer. Rosale said she was relieved that Nora was gone, but worried that with Mack and Lewis still here, they were far from out of the woods. Tony said Mack tried to kick him while he was down, but he wasn’t going away that easily, and he was more determined than ever to kick ass tomorrow. Esmé was disappointed that Gordon was still here, as he was way more trouble than he was worth. Dylan was more upset that Freddy was still here, and also pissed at India for revealing that his nomination wasn’t unanimous. Freddy said that like he said before, FredEx always delivers, and even if his team didn’t want him, he was still going to make sure Ramsay saw him shine at every opportunity.

Our experience was a mix of wonderful highlights and a few areas that could use improvement, but overall, it made for a memorable holiday getaway.

Huge shoutout to u/Alex_travels who I used to book the trip with. 

**Where we went**: *FS Oahu Ko Olina*

**When we went**: *12/21-12/26*

**Who went**: *6 people in total, 2 rooms, My wife (35) and I (33) , my 2 year old son, my father (69) and mother (64) and sister (27). added* ages *for context.* 

**Pictures of the property**: *Pictures really are worth 1,000 words so feel free to drop them in - just of the property/rooms, nothing personal*

**Service**: *9/10*

The service at the Four Seasons Oahu at Ko Olina was excellent, especially considering we visited during the busy Christmas period when the hotel was fully booked, and staff were working through the holidays. Despite the high occupancy, the team consistently provided attentive and efficient service.

Our check-in process was seamless and stress-free, with our room ready even before our arrival. The pool staff were exceptional, with a few standout servers who took care of us throughout our stay, making the experience even more enjoyable. Room service each morning was consistently prompt and of high quality, with the added convenience of ordering and communicating with the front desk via the in-room tablet—a feature we found very user-friendly.

While the service was impressive overall, the one aspect that could elevate it to a perfect 10/10 would be the inclusion of a dedicated personal concierge service. This feature, common at other high-end properties, would have been a welcome addition, providing regular check-ins to ensure every need or request was anticipated and addressed proactively. 

Nonetheless, the staff’s dedication and hospitality were noteworthy and contributed greatly to our positive experience.

**Property**: *7.5/10*

The property is undeniably beautiful, offering stunning ocean views from our rooms, pristine cleanliness, and meticulously maintained landscaping. The beachfront access was conveniently located directly in front of the resort, and there were ample chairs available each morning for guests. The pool and beach areas were well-managed, with staff diligently clearing off unused chairs to avoid the frustration of items being left to ""reserve"" chairs all day. While the pool and beach chairs tended to fill up by mid-morning (around 10 a.m.), as early risers, we never encountered any issues securing a spot. 

However, the layout of the hotel left much to be desired. Upon entering the property, one might expect a grand, open-air view of the ocean, but instead, the initial impression is limited to an interior view of the hotel, with only a small glimpse of the ocean visible. The design felt underwhelming for a property of this caliber. 

Additionally, the flow from the lobby to the lower lobby, where the pool, beach, and restaurants are located, was awkward. Guests had to take an elevator down, which opened into a somewhat confusing hallway before finally reaching the outdoor amenities. 

While the location and the overall experience were lovely, the lackluster layout detracted from what could have been a more seamless and breathtaking experience.

**Rooms**: *9/10*

We stayed in two connecting rooms: an Ocean Front King and an Ocean Front Double with two beds. Both rooms were exceptionally spacious, and the connecting layout was a fantastic feature. It allowed our son to move freely between the two rooms without needing to use the hallway, which added convenience and peace of mind. 

The beds were very comfortable, and the pillows provided excellent support, ensuring restful sleep throughout our stay. The rooms were equipped with modern amenities, including TVs with streaming services, which was a nice touch for entertainment. The WiFi was fast and reliable, making it easy to stay connected. 

Housekeeping was exceptional, consistently maintaining the rooms to a high standard. They promptly replenished fresh water and attended to any additional requests with efficiency and care. Overall, the accommodations were thoughtfully designed and well-maintained, contributing to a comfortable and seamless experience for our family.

**Food**: *8.5/10*

The food at the property was overall very good. Each morning, we opted for room service breakfast, so I cannot comment on the breakfast options at the on-site restaurants. However, the room service breakfast menu was diverse enough to provide variety over our six-day stay. The fresh juices were excellent, the coffee was of high quality, and the morning bread and pastry selection was both fresh and delicious. 

At the pool, we particularly enjoyed the fish tacos and nachos, which were standout options. That said, there were two amenities we felt were missing in the pool and beach area. First, a smoothie bar offering freshly made fruit smoothies or açaí bowls would have been a fantastic addition and likely popular among guests. While they did offer juice-blended smoothies, the fresh fruit option would elevate the experience. Second, the addition of a fresh ice cream or gelato stand near the pool would have been a welcome treat for both kids and adults alike. 

Among the dining options, Mina’s Fish House was our favorite restaurant. The seafood served throughout the property was consistently excellent. We also attended one of the holiday buffet dinners, which we thoroughly enjoyed. As seasoned diners with access to highly rated restaurants at home, my wife and I consider ourselves discerning food critics. For Hawaii, we found the food to be very good, particularly if you stick to seafood dishes. 

The steak, however, was underwhelming—it didn’t stand out in any way. The Wagyu sliders were enjoyable but not remarkable, and while the sushi was good, it wasn’t extraordinary. Throughout our stay, we dined exclusively on the property as there were no noteworthy restaurants nearby. Unfortunately, we were unable to try Noa due to last-minute reservation challenges; the available times were too late for our son, so we had to skip it. 

In summary, the dining experience was very satisfying, especially the seafood options, but there are opportunities for enhancement, particularly in the poolside offerings.

I never should have taken those tapes. I found them while exploring the old Digtech plant outside town. Everyone knows about the accident - the unexplained explosion in '97 that shut everything down overnight.

The east wing is still blackened, and no one ever explained what really happened. The whole place looks frozen in time - half-empty coffee cups, personal items still on desks, like everyone just vanished mid-shift.

In the security office, behind a loose wall panel, I found a box of unlabeled VHS tapes. The first tape showed nothing but empty hallways - endless corridors that seemed wrong somehow.

I’d absolutely use this type rub on prime rib again. I think next time I’d pull it at a slightly lower temp, do a 15 min rest while I got the coals hot, then do a good sear before a longer rest.

My husband, 28, is a manager at his sales job. I try my best to be a really good wife, I try to keep the house clean, I make sure the kids finish homework by the time he's home, I make sure dinner is ready right when he gets here, I bring him coffee in bed every morning, I try really hard, but I think his work is stressing him out.

We don't allow alcohol inside the house. If we're out in a date, we'll have a glass of champagne but that's it, nothing in the house.

The other night he came home super dizzy and loopy and was swearing at me saying he wants to f**k me when the kids are asleep. And then that night he made me do unspeakable things.

In the morning he always says how he hates his job but he'll never be able to make this kind of money doing anything else, I thought maybe I could start working and he can do something he enjoys but he refused.

And every night for the past few nights he comes home all dizzy and loopy and I think he's drunk. I thought maybe it's because he's stressed. He says he isn't he's just tired but I don't think I believe that. 

Last night I was in the bathroom beecsuse we were about to make love and I was putting on some extra makeup and he fell over just by walking, and then he told me to hurry up and fell asleep before I was done.

I wonder if it's because I'm not a good enough wife, I hope that's not the case. I just don't want to confront him about it because I feel he will get defensive  ",2,1736564561.0,Marriage,6,0.67,False

1hyme79,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1hyme79/i_watch_the_coyote_it_watches_me/,I watch the coyote. It watches me. ,"My name is Melanie. I’m twenty three years old and I’m clinically depressed. Not pulling for sympathy here or anything, just stating a fact. I couldn’t tell you when it started and I don’t think it’ll ever end. I’ve mourned a lot in my twenty three years and I’d like to think it shaped me into the shell of a human I am today. My daily functions are toggled like that of a sim’s. Going through the motions and doing only the things I know are essential to my survival, though, I’m not really sure what my purpose here is. They say grief gets better with time. That one day, it won’t hurt as much. That’s bullshit. The feelings of grief come and go like waves lapping the shore. It begs the question, if it always comes back does it ever really leave? 

I’d been to two funerals before age twelve. Both distant relatives that I hadn’t ever met.  Their passing, specifically, didn’t thwart me much. However, the process of a funeral, an open casket, my little feet padding closer to a dead body, it was as if my consciousness began there. Where some saw a celebration of a life well lived, I saw the black and unforgiving maw of death through the eyes of a child. 

It’s safe to say I wasn’t the same. Anxiety taunted me at night and I spent four years sleeping on the floor in my parent’s bedroom. My mom was my comfort and my dad was my protector. As long as they were by my side, I’d be okay. 

“Shelia is getting a horse?!” My ten year old self exclaimed. I’d been lost in the rain droplets on the car window, choosing a particularly supple drop with my index finger. I traced it as it raced down the window towards the finish line, worthy opponents on all sides. But my focus on my champion was snapped by my parents speaking in hushed tones. I heard Shelia, my mom’s friend. And I heard horse. 

“No, Mel, not a horse.” My dad replied in tangent, earning a look from my mother I’d only seen before I was scolded. My parents locked eyes at the red light, seeming to have some sort of telepathic conversation with their eyes. They did that a lot. My mom sighed then, pinching the bridge of her nose. 

“Shelia is getting a divorce.” 

“What’s a divorce?” I asked. I’d never heard the word before. I was an only child at the time with two doting parents so, can you blame me?

“A divorce is when a husband and a wife, well, stop being husband and wife. They break up, essentially, and go their separate ways.” My mom explained, her words ringing in my ears as panic increased in my naive heart.  

“You and dad won’t get a divorce right?” I asked, the words spilling frantically from me. It never occurred to me that this was something plausible. Shelia’s daughter, my friend Megan, must’ve been going through the worst of times. 

“Sweetheart no, your mother and I are very much in love. It’s true love, in fact. You know nothing can stop true love.” My dad reassured and my mom smiled. I was at ease. My dad was the king, my mom the queen, and I their one and only princess. My life was perfect. Divorce wouldn’t tear my family apart and with them by my side, I’d be okay. 

How stupid of me. Two years later I’m seated on the couch with my mom, our dog curled up in between us. My dad, seated on the loveseat in front of me, is offering up platitudes and reassurances. I hear what he’s saying and it registers in my mind…but it’s like watching the news during a tragedy. The reporters spill information out and the tv drones on but you become awash in some dreadful emotion that tugs you down like a swift current. You can drown while sitting perfectly still in your own home. 

“I’ll still be there for your cross country meets and band concerts.” 

It hadn’t even been a full twenty four hours and my dad was already slipping from me the way the sun dips behind the clouds. I wanted to shout at him, scream at him, curse his name, and maybe even slap him. But I simply said, “Okay,” while glancing down at my hands, my torn up nail beds. 

I’ll spare you the gory details as much as possible, but it’s bleak. My dad had cheated on my mom with my children’s minister at church. A kind woman I’d come to trust over the years, as I’d frequented that church since I was a baby. The coming months were messy. My dad found new living arrangements. I tried to put on an excited face for him and his new house but all I felt was dread. Then, a few weeks later, the big one happened. What could be worse than adultery, impending divorce, and separating households you might ask? A pregnancy. My forty two year old mom was unexpectedly pregnant. The pregnancy itself was nothing short of miraculous. My mom shouldn’t have been able to have anymore children. She’d had some procedures, emergency cyst removal, and was down a whole fallopian tube. So somehow, in the midst of our shared anguish, my mom and I had to navigate uncharted territory entirely. 

Little did I know, at the time, my baby sister would be our salvation. She arrived early, like I had, entering this world with a round head, a button nose, and a shock of strawberry blonde hair. She breathed life back into me and my mom. Our days were busier and there wasn’t time to focus on the bleak, melancholy of it all. At thirteen, I held my infant sister in my arms, teary-eyed with my cousins at my side. At twenty three, I’m watching her run towards me off the school bus. 

“You’re in pajamas again.” She says, sidestepping me to reach for the doorknob. 

“Astute.” I reply and follow her into the house. Our routine hardly changes. I wake up around noon, wait for her to come home, she gets a snack and goes to read or watch tv, and I just…exist. Sometimes, I’ll remember to eat. Sometimes I’ll listen to a podcast while doing laundry, creepy stories droning through my headphones, sometimes I’ll draw. Or, most days, I crawl back into bed and lie still until my mom gets home. When she does, we’ll talk for roughly twenty minutes and I’ll revert back to my room and glide under the covers once more. Like I said, you can drown while staying perfectly still in your own home. I’ve lost a lot that I will never get back. My grandparents on my mom’s side, to old age. My grandpa on my dad’s, to cancer. My cousin, to suicide. My baby, to miscarriage. My dad, to another family. 

When you don’t see someone for a while, you start to forget their face. In my mind, it’s like in anime, where an unimportant character you won’t see again is talking and the top half of their face is blackened out, the animators not even bothering to draw any detail above the mouth. You’ll forget smile lines, forehead wrinkles, tattoos, things like that. If enough time passes, even their voice is lost on you. 

The house is dark now. I stand in the kitchen absentmindedly filling my cup with ice, then water. It’s snowing, in Tennessee, our one snowfall of the year. It collects and piles on the grass outside and if I stand close enough to the glass back door, I’ll feel the cold air on the other side of it. The house is quiet and empty. My mother and sister are on a trip with my sister’s cheer squad. I stayed behind, I don’t do well on trips anymore. 

When you float through life aimlessly you aren’t as privy to things. My focus is never wholly on anything in particular, and what a more alert person might pick up on, drifts past me like a winter wind. 

My corgi is on high alert, snapping me out of a daze. Her ears flatten against her head, her little body standing at attention by the back door. A low growl emanates from her. 

“Dude, hush.” I tell her. She’d bark at a leaf if the wind stirred it. Another low growl escapes her and she stands stock still. I sit down on the couch with a sigh, drape my blanket over my legs, pick up my ipad and stylus and resume my drawing. I begin to shade my sketch, losing myself in the process and droning out all other thought but my art. After a while, I glance at the stove clock, half an hour has passed. And my corgi is still standing at attention by the back door. “Come here Winnie.” I call to her, patting the couch. Usually, that sequence incites a rush of paws and fur into my lap and an excited pup in my arms. Not now, not this time. Her pointed ears flatten again and she whines, not a growl, but a whimper. The dim lamp light beside me flickers and the bulb hums and buzzes before the light it gives off dies out entirely. I move from the couch and scoop Winnie up in my arms, glancing over my shoulder to the yard beyond the glass. I live in a sprawling neighborhood, with homes so close together you could throw a rock and hit at least a few in one go. My neighbors all conveniently have fenced in yards, with six foot gaps in between them on all sides. We could afford our house, not the fencing. Animals traipse to and fro in our yard often. My large neighborhood is bordered by thick, dense woods. It’s not uncommon for me to spy a rabbit or two during the spring, or a doe and her fawn on the outskirts of the running trail in front of the neighborhood. So when I see an animalistic silhouette, I’m not alarmed. 

“Geez dude, it’s just a-“ I flick on the backyard light. It only casts a little light into the space, illuminating sparkling snow and Winnie’s paw prints. The light falls just short of whatever is out there but it’s unmistakable to me now. Glowing eyes peer into the glass door set above a hewn snout. Dark lines of the animal’s slender silhouette reveal perked up ears, gangly body, and a puffy tail. A coyote, not uncommon for these parts, I’m just grateful I hadn’t decided to let Winnie out for a bathroom break. “It’s just a coyote.” I tell her as she wriggles in my arms. “It can’t hurt you in here.” I tell her again, opting to take her upstairs to my room, lest the coyote provoke her malice once more. 

After an hour, Winnie tires herself out in my bed, splayed out with her back legs in the air, sound asleep. By this point, it’s around eleven pm and I’m far from tired. I make my way downstairs and fiddle with the lamp. The bulb isn’t just burnt out, I realize, it’s completely blackened from top to bottom. I head to fetch a replacement from the bin in our garage, passing the kitchen and the glass door to my backyard as I go. I stiffen, sort of halted in that middle space of my home. I turn my head, that deep innate fear that I’m being watched isn’t easily ignored. A dark blanket of unease falls over me like a billow of snow that glides off the roof when it begins to melt. I cast my gaze through the glass door and see the coyote, its position unchanged, save for the fact that it was now seated on its haunches and staring directly into my home. 

“What the fuck?” 

I should preface, I am google’s strongest soldier. After retrieving a new bulb from the garage, and locking eyes with the ever present coyote as I pass through the kitchen, I tap away at the keys and in a moment I’m presented with a more logical explanation. Coyotes are opportunistic hunters that often prey on small animals, including small house pets. Winnie had seen the coyote and it had seen her. Surely, with the snow we’ve had for a solid week, prey was scarce. You won’t get my dog, fucker. 

I fall back into my comfortable pattern of drawing until my fingers go numb-thanks carpel tunnel syndrome-long into the night. Around two am, I call it, my eyes growing weary and exhausted. My phone buzzes on the coffee table. I answer.

“Hey, Mel.” 

“Andre. Hi, how’s work?” My voice wavers slightly. That unease I felt before, I couldn’t shake, even now. 

“What’s wrong Mel? You sound sad.” 

“I’m not sad I’m just…scared I guess.” I answer, biting away at my cuticles, phone pressed to my ear propped up by my shoulder. “Hold on, let me put you on speaker.” I tell him. 

“Why are you scared, love?” His voice reassures me. Just his comforting tone alone is enough to make me shake off the anxiety. 

“I saw this coyote in the backyard. Well, Winnie saw it first.” I divulge. 

“Did she give it hell?” 

“You know she did. She didn’t scare it off, though. Her sausage body isn’t very intimidating.” I say, chuckling. I feel like I can breathe easier. “Just, being home alone for the weekend has me a little spooked, I guess.” 

“It’s okay. I’m here.” Andre reassures me. “And right when I clock out I’ll drive over and spend the night so you won’t be alone okay?” 

“Okay.” 

“I’m off at 4.” 

“I hate that they have you on graveyard shift now.”

“I know babe, but I need the money. I gotta go now or my boss will be on my ass. Just hang tight okay? Only a few more hours. I love you.” 

“I love you.” The line beeps and I set down my phone, wrapped in Andre’s hoodie, my restless mind at bay. 

The coyote is closer. 

I don’t know when it moved but it did. It’s only a few paces from the concrete slab outside the glass door, staring at me with wide, wet eyes, orange beady pearls that seem to slice through my gut. I’d only stepped into the kitchen to flick the house lights off…

I blink and it’s closer, right up against the glass. Its breath fogs up the window. For a moment, it does nothing, just silently huffs misty exhales. I watch the coyote, it watches me. I stare in abject horror as it leans its head back then bangs its forehead against the glass. Then again. And again. And again. The glass door now bloodied, I dart upstairs, slamming my room door shut behind me and sliding down the wood. My chest heaves, my paled skin breaking out in a cold sweat. What the fuck was that? My heart hammers in my chest with a ferocity so intense, it threatens to leap out. 

“Melly? Can I sleep in your room?” A voice softly begs behind my door. Lyla? It can’t be…she’s in Gatlinburg. I glance down at the hallway light leaking through the gap in between the door and the carpet. Sure enough, I see Lyla’s feet there, her penguin pajama pants at her ankles. I don’t have time to question it. There are times I could’ve been kinder to her, despite the fog in my head. I should say yes to sister sleepovers more often. I shouldn’t sleep the day away after she gets home from school. I should play with her in the snow more. She’s had nightmares before, calling out my name, screaming for me or my mom to help her. I don’t know when her and my mom got home, or why my mom never called to tell me, but that doesn’t matter right now. I open the door, ready to receive my sister with open arms and comfort her…but there’s nothing. She’s not there. 

“What-Lyla?” I pant, my voice rattling in my throat as I call out her name. Then my voice echoes back to me from the gap where the stairs are. 

“What-Lyla?” 

Fight, flight, or freeze is a funny thing. Before I know it, I’m tugging on a thick carhartt jacket over Andre’s hoodie, stepping into boots in my pajama pants and flying down the stairs. 

“Melly. I’m scared.” I hear her voice but I can’t see her. The glass door is open, just wide enough for a nine year old to slip out. The blood, it’s gone. The coyote, it’s gone. 

“Melly!! Melly help!!” Her voice is beckoning me from outside. I run through the back door, slamming it shut in my wake, enough to rattle the glass panes. I hear barking as I run, wild yelping and screeching. I follow Lyla’s voice, her wails, with each crunching step of my boots against snow. I have to find her, I will find her. I find purpose in this, at least. I’ll save my sister and I’ll be her protector, like my dad was to me. But I’ll never leave her side, not like him. 

I run until I’m at the edge of the forest. There’s no noise here. No chirping, no chittering, no barking, no Lyla. 

Then, the forest explodes in a chorus of wails so loud I have to cover my ears, buckling to my knees in the snow. Harsh screeching and yelping all amalgamating into a violent, deafening melody. It slowly dies down and I hear a baby crying. An infant’s colicky cry. Then, a voice like a whisper begins pinging to my right ear, then my left. 

“Run.” 

“Run.”

“Run!” 

It’s odd, it propels me forwards, shaking off the snow clinging to my knees as I stand, how it sounds like my dad cheering me on at a cross country meet the day I hit my pr. I’d almost forgotten his voice. A sickly sweet scent fills my nostrils, causing me to gag.

“Melly!!!” Another scream. “Melly help!!!” I press on, deeper into the dense tree-line, thick snow crunching beneath my boots. “Lyla?! Where are you?!” I call out in sheer desperation, eyes darting between the dark trees, fervently searching for my sister. All is quiet, save for a single wail, this time it sounds like the call of a loon, awoo-ooo. I nearly crumble to my knees but I press on, tears gliding down my cheeks and my neck with no abandon.

“It’s okay. I’m here.” His voice is soft and comforting, yet utterly monotone, no inflictions, nothing. I stop dead in my tracks. No, no, it’s not possible. Andre is at work, he is at work and I know this because he called me on his break. 

“Andre?” My head is on a swivel, but I’m utterly alone in the dense woods. 

“I’m here.” His voice calls from the left. I take a step towards it as fog rolls in, clouding the space. The moon in its grace, gives me a little light. About twelve feet away, I see a silhouette poking out from behind a tree, the outline of a man. A sigh of relief escapes me.  Andre. “I’m here, come here.” As I get closer, my eyes are pouring tears, the cold bites, threatening to freeze them against my cheeks. 

“Andre! You have to help me! Something took Lyla I-“ 
My mind is a muddled mess but I stop, as something primal and intrinsically prey-like in me, sends a flash of warning through my senses. His hand curls around the bark of the tree with long, gangly fingers. Half of his head pokes out from behind the tree. I can’t make out his face, just the outline, but he’s tall…too tall…and his arm that reaches across the branch and strokes the tree downward is bone thin. I back up a step. 

“I’m here Mel.” His voice calls out to me, not originating from the thing in front of me, but behind me. I swivel and nothing’s there. When I turn, whatever that thing is has vanished. The forest goes silent and all I can hear is the beating of my own, frantic heart. 

That’s when I hear it, another loon call. Awoo-ooo. 

“Melly!!” 

“Lyla!!!!” 

“Lyla where are you-“ Long tendril fingers clasp over my mouth. I catch a glimpse of something fleshy and crimson with sagging tendons, veins, and red, bloodied skin pulled tightly to bone. Towering and utterly human in shape, but…inside out. 

Strange. There’s a gash in me and it’s pulling, pulling, pulling at something it shouldn’t. Oh, my intestines. I fall flat against soft snow, mangled. A vhs tape in fallen snow, spilling its film in a tangled mess. 

Awooo-oooo…

I smell the rot, the thick stench of my own gore. If I could just get home to Lyla I could’ve been more for her. Could she smell the rot all these years, my hollowed out shell? There is nothing left of me to love. Liar, liar, liar, I couldn’t crawl home even if I wanted to. My guts are spilled and splayed out of the cavernous tear in my stomach. I draw short breaths. I’m afraid. I’m sorry mom. I’m sorry Andre. I’m so sorry Lyla. If I hadn’t bowed my head to this illness my whole life, I could have been a better big sister…I could have been…I learn…I learn to die as I bleed out in the snow.

It did not come with a milk jug however it is compatible with one. I was thinking of buying a replacement one from De'Longhi however they are about $100. I was hoping for something a bit cheaper.

I've noticed a few of the bigger milk jugs for the slightly bigger machines (for ""ECAM"" machines) are cheaper, approx $50 on eBay. My machine I believe is an ""ETAM"" machine. The attachment at the machine honestly looks identical though so I am suspecting that they would work. Maybe they would sit past the edge of the drip tray? Can anyone confirm if these do in fact fit and work? 

As an alternative or perhaps even preferred option is there a way to connect this machine directly to a jug of milk with a hose? This would seem easier for cleaning etc.

I'm a 50F. I made the mistake of going to the pharmacy during the Friday lunch rush (located in a small shopping area between a coffee shop and a deli). It was really crowded, so I had to circle the lot a few times to get a spot. Our pharmacy closes from 12-1:00pm, so people start queueing up outside at around 12:45, waiting for it to re-open. I was 7th in line.

While I was waiting, I see a Boomer lady standing with her car door open, parked about 20' away in the disabled spot, directly in front of the café. I couldn't see a placard as the sun was reflecting on her windscreen, but I wasn't really looking.

Boomer lady stares at the pharmacy line and makes a shocked Pikachu face, like she's surprised at all the people waiting. In short, she \*knew\* there was already a queue to get in.

About a minute later, the pharmacist opens the door. Just as we start filing in, Boomer lady comes walking up the stairs, no problems, and slithers into the third spot. 

It really steamed me because I knew she was gonna jump it and she fucking did!

I called out, ""Excuse me?"". She didn't acknowledge, so I left my spot and walked up to her and said, ""Excuse me, ma'am? The line starts back here"" and gestured to the rear. I think I was pretty polite.

She made another face and said, ""But I'm just here to pick up my prescr..."". She trailed off when I said ""We all are!"". She tried to act all innocent and kind of giggled (wut), but she did move to the back. I didn't say anything else to her and went back to my spot.

Things settle down and then the 65-ish y o woman directly in front of me starts repeatedly asking me, ""Why are you here? Are you here for vaccinations? Why are you here?"". Umm, lady, I'm standing in the prescription pick-up line, like everyone else? She must've asked 3-4 times.

I was really confused why vax-lady was pestering me; it's none of her business why I was there and I didn't answer because I was getting really flustered. Confrontation makes me extremely itchy and I was already annoyed at the queue-jumper, so my brain was kind of glitching.

Next thing I know, this late 40s Karen directly \*behind\* me starts berating me for not answering vax-lady's questions. I was sandwiched between the these two weirdos who were \*both\* talking at me in a very weird/unpleasant manner.

The Karen was lecturing me about being ""too aggressive"" (I guess for calling out the queue-jumper?). Then she says, ""Why won't you answer her \[vax-lady's\] question? You need to answer her. All she did is ask you a question? Why are you so rude?"". It was insane.

I turned round to face the Karen and said, ""I don't \*need\* to do \*anything\*, but you \*need\* to get off my \*ass\*"". I also asked her if she liked being a doormat. I wasn't proud of that, but she was all up in my business, standing 2' away, and it was \*really\* pissing me off. 

So, you guys, am I the rude asshole here for calling out the Boomer, refusing to tell vax-lady  my business and telling Karen to back off?



tl;dr:   
Entitled boomer jumps the pharmacy line. I call her out. Get berated by a weird, bossy Karen because I refused to answer another stranger's question as to why I was at the pharmacy.",2,1736563981.0,AITAH,3,0.75,False

I tried a few brands and flavors of ""instant"" egg white protein powder. There was a clear winner and I actually like the powder better than the whey powders I have tried. Here are the results:

**OvaEasy Egg White Protein, Chocolate Cake** \- 26g protein per serving.

* **Cost:** When buying single serve packets, they work out to be about $3.40/oz serving, but you're paying for the single serve packaging here. When buying the larger 21 oz bag (not single serve), the price works out to $2/ 1 oz, 26 g serving.
* **Taste:** It tastes close to Swiss Miss hot chocolate, but it also has a tad of cocoa powder, not enough to alter choline much though.
* **Mixing:** i just mixed it with 8 oz water and that was actually pretty good, again like a hot cocoa, but could definitely be improved with a better base. It had clumps but was able to be mixed with a spoon/straw to mostly dissolved, whereas other egg proteins just form slimy clumps and then when you try to blend they foam up.
* **Buying:** Have to buy it from the website [ovaeasy.com](http://ovaeasy.com) ([direct link](https://ovaeasy.com/products/egg-white-protein?variant=32270042300503))
* **Macros:** 1.16 oz = 120 calorie, 26g protein, 3g carbs

Personally I can justify the cost, about the cost of a coffee and I am getting most of my protein macros with zero choline worry.

Comparisons:

1. Same brand, OvaEasy: Vanilla Creme Brulee flavor. Not as good but definitely second place. Kinda thin as it lacks the cocoa powder bulk and thickness, I think. Would take it if there was nothing else, though.
2. JAYROBB Vanilla Flavored Egg White Protein. Not great. If you don't like the weird bitter taste of stevia, you won't like this. It could be sweetened additionally, but its not even close in flavor to OvaEasy, and around the same cost. No artificial flavors though. Also, clumps and kinda becomes a slimy mess. Won't throw it away though.",1,1736563976.0,u_Beautiful_Tap_1654,0,1.0,False

**Tips for Cutting and Engraving Plywood with a AEON Laser Machine**  
Cutting and engraving plywood with a laser machine can produce stunning results, but achieving the best quality requires attention to details. Here are some tips to help you maximize efficiency and quality:

**1. Choose Quality Plywood:** Use laser-friendly plywood like Baltic birch with minimal voids and low glue content.

**2. Prepare the Material:** Clean the surface and use masking tape to reduce burn marks.

**3. Optimize Settings:** Adjust speed and power based on thickness:**Air Assist & Ventilation:** Use air assist to reduce scorching and ensure proper ventilation to clear smoke.

● Engraving: Low power, moderate speed.

● Cutting: High power, slower speed.

**4. Test First:** Perform test cuts to find the best settings and account for kerf (cut width).

**5. Post-Processing:** Sand edges and apply finish for a clean, polished look.

**6. Machine Maintenance:** Keep lenses and mirrors clean, and ensure the bed is level for consistent results.

  
While plywood is an incredible material for laser crafting, the possibilities with an AEON Laser machine go far beyond that. Our machines are designed to handle a wide range of non-metal materials, including acrylic, MDF, rubber, EVA foam, and more. Each material opens the door to new creative opportunities, from vibrant acrylic signage to durable rubber stamps, flexible EVA designs, and precise MDF prototypes. With **AEON Laser**, the only limit is your imagination. Start exploring the endless applications today and see what you can create!

I have a new partner who has a severe allergy to cats, and therefore my cat can no longer be in the bedroom or kitchen. I put up a tall cat gate going to the kitchen, and per the vet's advice I keep him in the basement at night where he has access to food, water, litter, toys, bed, blanket, and a cat tree. I have had him since 2021 and he is used to being able to go wherever he wants and sleep on the bed if he so chooses. Before it was not like he slept with me every single night; he just had the option to and was a really chill guy. Ever since I implemented this change 4 months ago, he has been vocal to the point where I cannot enjoy my own home.

THINGS I HAVE TRIED

\-I took him to the vet; he has no underlying medical issues

\-Vet prescribed 100mg gabapentin, it did nothing

\-After several months of 100mg not working, vet changed it to 200mg twice a day and that has not changed his meowing at all

\-I play with him before bed and during the day

\-I spend several hours a day on the couch with him snuggling and hanging out

\-I changed his food to LiveClear to see if that would help my partner's allergies and my partner tried taking allergy medication, but they did not lessen the severity of the allergies

If I go in my room to even change my clothing, he just howls. If I'm on the couch with him and get up to use the bathroom, he cries. He wakes me up during the night with his meowing and I am not getting enough sleep. I can't make a cup of coffee in the kitchen without protesting from him. The funny thing is, it's only when I'm around. When my partner is at home with him, he's fine. No meowing at all, even if my partner goes into the bedroom or kitchen. As soon as I walk out of the door to leave for work, there's silence. He seems to have a really unhealthy attachment to me but I am not going to give up my partner for my cat. I am very sympathetic to the fact that this change must be very hard for him and that's why I have been looping in my vet and being very patient, but I'm starting to wonder if it's in my cat's own best interest to go to a home where he can freely roam where he pleases, because he doesn't seem too happy with this current situation. I know they say it's 3 months to for cats to adjust, but it's been 4 and we've tried medication and I'm not sure what else I can do. I'm so heartbroken and at my wit's end and am seeking advice.

Date [Standardized Human Time]: *I don’t remember. But does it matter much anymore?*

——

Looking back on it now, it’s difficult to remember. But that’s how things are, isn’t it? Every important thing you do, every little piece of eternity you chisel for yourself, all eventually joins the nebulous monolith of ‘some point in time’, its details filled into unrecognizability. Looking at it now, I’m ashamed that the most important day in my life was now one of those days. A vague impression you can somewhat recall if you spend enough time mulling over it. So I ask myself to forgive myself, for my account will be … incomplete. I’ll try to be as accurate as possible.

The news that Humanity is fordoomed had been announced days prior. In these times, people had still tried to fight it. If I recall, they attempting to collapse a neuron star where it had cast its shadow - but I always thought it was a foolish thing to do. So I never paid much attention to it. What I do recall however was the mass exodus of Humanity’s finest back to Earth. Scientists, engineers, mechanics - space was chock full of thousands of noble souls who made their exodus from their homes back to Mankind’s cradle to participate in Project Demiurge. To this day, I remain grateful that I had been born on Earth, so I wouldn’t have to make a similarly harrowing journey.

That morning we were drinking coffee. Or was it tea? I moreso recall my surprise that we were using *paper* rather than computers. The provided pens were unfamiliar in hands that only ever worked with machinery. But I made due, though Enoch always found the awkward way I would hold the fountain pen amusing. He found everything amusing. He was with me as the Co-Head to the Gilese 832 branch of Project Demiurge. I was sorting through a list of planned species, unsure of what I would personally do. I … can’t recall what I had read, in truth, but it was a list of animals already used and what planet it pertains to. I recall thinking how strange it was to use Octopuses for a species, but … *what was his name?* … ah … Tzevaot, he was an artist. The type that I couldn’t ever be.

Enoch though, he never had a plan. The man was the type to throw paint at a wall and make it into an art piece. I could tell that he had his own designs at that point, but he didn’t say what. All he asked me was, “What are you thinking, Ith?”

“Hm? Well … There's some interesting choices so far. How many species are being engineered galaxy-wide?”

“Hah. That’s a question I’d ask you, Harrison. We’re doomed if you don’t know.”

“This project was doomed the moment I chose you as my co-Lead.”

“Yeah, right. You’d be lost without me.”

“I’d figure it out eventually.”

The two of us shared a mutual laugh. I think it took me longer to finish. Enoch was always so infuriating, from our days in college until the very end. But he viewed the creation of life as a miracle, while to me it was cold science. He had a way with words, with people, that made him magnetic. Sometimes I wish that he lived to be here. Or that he survived and not me. But frankly, with hindsight, I’m glad that he hasn’t lived to see this. To see my children cannibalize his so cruelly. Or at least that’s what I tell myself. For in truth, I feel horribly lost without him. I could continue with such wishful thinking many times, but the truth would always remain that I wish he was here. If the two of us weathered college graduation together, we’d have made one hell of a team reversing course of Venlil culture.

Forgive me. I’m rambling. Let’s get back to the point.

I recall how it was straight back to business. I had stared at the sheet and back at the data providing an estimate of Gilese 832’s post-terraforming terrain. And it had occurred to me how rocky it would be. How could and mountainous it’d turn out. It was a perfect chance for me to preserve my favorite animal, long beyond the stewardship of Man. For any species I didn’t choose, I would be dooming to a most cruel and confusing death it was incapable of understanding, unlike Man. But I didn’t have the heart to choose anything else, not when it was so unlikely to be taken by any of the other hundreds of Projects. Ones that I couldn’t guarantee would make it in our limited window. 

So I chose my favorite. The humble sheep.

“If anyone here deserves a second chance, it’s sheep.” I finally said, “They’ve given us everything, with little in return. It’s only right that we give back to them now.”

I think that’s how I worded it. Or am I accidentally being too wordy? Take my words with some suspicion, as I am not a reliable narrator. Especially in the twilight years of our species. So many weird things happened to our senses then, that I trust very little of it. It sounds too religious. What I do remember is how Enoch responded.

“Playing favorites?”

I paused. 

“Yes. Yes I am. They’d be well-suited to survival on a planet like this, if we’re smart. They’d need a sturdier frame to walk bipedally, so we could have a strong species here.”

I don’t recall how Enoch responded here. He either made yet another joke as he investigated the paper himself, or he pointed out how detrimental herd instincts could be to society. Especially in Humanity’s eyes - ever being the painfully staunch individualists our species was comprised of. And in hindsight, I think it was probably the latter, as I got lost so often in lofty dreams and data, that I never considered the practicalities. My memory blurs heavily here. But I recall the taste of coffee.

… So it was coffee after all …

But eventually, Enoch made a decision. 

“I’m afraid that their instincts could linger, no matter how much we modify the brain. So why don’t we divert resources to make two species? If you want sheep, we could take some sort of shepherd dog species - maybe Bernards … or Collies, and modify them to act opposite of the worst we think a sheep could act? Level-headed, rational, but keep that stupid love they feel.”

“How do we know one species wouldn't wipe the other out?”

“Any species we create will inevitably end up with some sort of genetic memory. Flickering fragments of seconds. Of lights and sound. Sights maybe. The earliest ones we raise together. Put them in one place when the time comes. And when generations pass, they’ll recognize each other as siblings, even if the worst comes to pass.”

I recall that I remained silent for a while, but I ended up agreeing. The two of us stayed up long into the night planning. Who would become Venlil would originate as Baby Doll Sheep, while these shepherds of Enoch - they were once Saint Bernard dogs. We discussed what changes would even be possible - but impossible never felt like it existed back in those times. And it really didn’t. Mankind had unanimously turned its focus to our work of creation. Our final parting gift. Our actions were that of legend, shaping mountains and stopping rivers, for *their* sake.

But looking at it now, like Saturn, the Venlil devoured. My brainless, reckless, idiotic … little children, so destructive.

I had given them my all, and now I’m nothing.

I think I’m done now. If Enoch Were here, he’d probably be disturbed that I now hold my own correctly as I catalog these memories. I hope that they will be understandable when they reach the public.

1hym3as,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCC/comments/1hym3as/bottlworks_a_detailed_review/,BOTTLWORKS - (a detailed review ),"OK how do I even start , I was so confused excited to come to cork and stay in this student accommodation, luxurious and aesthetic , starting off :
1) ROOMs 
Super small , not worth what you’re paying ,en-suite rooms ?? Super small the bathroom you just step in and you’re done it’s tiny, the rest of the common spaces are okay , they provide you with like basic appliances and stuff  , STUDIO rooms , knowing from friends who lives there , you pay around 400€/ week , yup you heard it right , PER WEEK and can’t even start to say how disappointing as they don’t provide you with any appliances, when asked upon , they just said management decided not to .
2. STAFF 
There are few of them that are good but the others are just blatantly rude and obnoxious ( feels racist sometimes as well) in particular the property manager , she’s always up your business and bothers you for everything . If you want “privacy” it’s definitely a myth around there . They do random “compliance checks” , inspections and so on , and mostly when everyone’s at college , so they have no issues walking in to your rooms , and even if asked , they’re ignorant to give you a proper reply and sometimes they won’t even give you a proper date or time when . 
There’s been at least 5 occurrences of a male staff entering a room unannounced or without prior notice .
3. ACCOMODATION ISSUES :
This was my condition all semester 
Frequent power outages , no water (drinking or bathroom) . no long-term solutions have been provided by the accommodation management, nor has there been any transparent communication regarding the causes of these outages. There is no explanation for what is happening, and no plan has been communicated for how or when these outages will officially be resolved. There has been very little accountability whatsoever demonstrated from management. At least one student, anxious and exhausted after repeated broken promises of electricity being restored, elected to book a hotel room, taking a considerable chunk out of their already meager student budget.

Many of the services that were promised as part of the rent package are either not functioning properly or completely unavailable. These issues include:
	•	Rooftop Terrace Access: The rooftop terrace has been closed without any explanation or timeline for when it will reopen.
	•	Heating Problems: Radiators are malfunctioning, leaving some students without heating for weeks after moving in.
	•	Limited Bike Availability: The “free use of bikes” is misleading, as only 13 bikes are available for the entire building, with no clear communication on how to access them. Many students didn’t even know they existed, and most bike racks remain unused.
	•	Coffee Machine Issues: The “free unlimited coffee” is limited to one frequently broken or empty machine.
	•	Frequent Fire Alarms: Fire alarms go off repeatedly without warning or explanation.
	•	Poor Quality Furnishings: The room furniture and fittings are cheaply made and poorly installed—floors dent easily, countertops stain, bedframes are flimsy, closets have unfinished openings, and there are paint smudges and fragile shower doors.
	•	Missing Items and Inconsistent Rooms: Some studios are missing essential items like blinds and shelves. 
	•	Misassigned Rooms: Several students were placed in accessible studio apartments instead of standard ones. These accessible rooms are smaller, have lower countertops, limited storage, and hospital-style bathrooms. No prior notice was given, yet students are charged the same high rent despite the differences.

I am going to try to keep this short.

These are both related to a recent ex. 

Number 1: My ex and i were dating  for about a year. We broke up in October. They use to tag different places with chalk/spray paint. Ive only been with them twice when i saw them tag. For about a month straight, i felt like their tag was near me or on me. I was constantly feeling the need to check every place i was at, in search for this tag. One day i was going on my normal walk. But i started  my route slightly different then normal. I looked over at a trash bin. This bin has several tags. And there it was ONE was theirs. It was in walking distance from my car and i could see it from my apartment window. Ever since i saw the tag that feeling disappeared. I talked to my ex and they mentioned they put the tag their when we were dating. 

Number 2: okay same thing my ex and i broke up in October. Recently, my mind has been telling me up they might be dating (now i want me ex to have happiness and date whoever but this is like side of brain is loud)…anyways let’s call this random person Mary. My brain is telling me my ex and Mary are dating and just negative thoughts. I recently met up with an old friend and they mentioned Mary. I played it cool because who wants to mention you’ve been obsessing over this person and your ex. But my brain can’t let it go. I’m trying to be present and not let my brain control me. Today i went into a coffee shop that I’ve been recently visiting and Mary is in there. Side note: i do know Mary but haven’t see her in years…what is my brain/universe saying? 

Am i strange or do i have some type if power of intuition? My ex and i always talked about these energies between us…. any feedback that maybe i have OCD?

1hym13c,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hym13c/men_how_to_get_a_date_in_2025/,Men: How to get a date in 2025,"I've seen a lot of posts here and elsewhere by guys who have trouble getting a date. Usually the reasons are not very complex—it usually boils down to a few fundamental issues. I've tried to distill it to five action points; if you follow these diligently and apply yourself, I can almost guarantee that you will get a date in 2025.

1. Learn how to approach women. This is not negotiable, so better start practicing right away. Set a goal to interact with at least five women you don't know, every day. It's OK to start small—if you're socially awkward, making small talk with a cashier counts. Once you're comfortable with that, move on to initiating conversations with strangers. After that, start asking for their contact details so you can get a date. The goal is to keep pushing the boundaries of your comfort zone, so you have to keep challenging yourself. If you're struggling to make conversation, ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" is a great book about how to talk to anyone—not just women.
2. Get your life in order. Take inventory of your life: What things are you not satisfied with, other than not having a girlfriend? Are you living a life that a woman would want to be a part of? Make a list of things in your life you would like to improve—social life, career, fitness, finance, how you dress, etc.—and then start aggressively pursuing these goals. Jordan Peterson's ""12 Rules for Life"" is a good starting point.
3. Hit the gym! For guys, strength training is an easy win—it improves your physique, gives you more confidence and is a natural way to increase testosterone (which makes you less risk averse). Aim for at least three 30-60 minute sessions a week if you want to see results. ""Starting Strength"" is a good primer for weightlifting, so start with that and move on to more advanced programs when you're ready. If you're too broke for the gym, or don't have one nearby, body weight resistance training works as well—a pull-up bar is like $50, so money is no excuse.
4. Go to places where women hang out. You can meet women at the gym, coffee shops, bookstores, special interest groups, not to mention dating apps. Classes are another great way to meet women, as you meet up with the same group of people multiple times. However, don't go to classes and activities *only* to meet women—make sure you're interested in the class as well. (E.g. don't be that weird guy who's always at the back of the yoga class).
5. Practice positivity. It's really easy to get stuck in a negative mindset if you're struggling with some aspect of your life. However, keep in mind that negative, self-deprecating thoughts are no more rational than positive thoughts, so you may just as well think positively. Try the following: Any time you have a negative thought like ""I'm never going to get a date"", try thinking an opposite, positive thought instead, like ""I will get a date if I apply myself"". Try to visualize the positive thought coming to life—you're on a date with a pretty girl and you're both having a great time. Try to make these ""daydreams"" as immersive as possible; make yourself feel excited about where you're going, rather than depressed about where you are. Do these visualization exercises as often as you can, but at the very least the first thing when you wake up in the morning and the last time you do before you fall asleep. Read ""The Secret"" for more about manifesting the life you want—it's all pseudoscience, but I do believe the principles work (but not for the reasons claimed in the book). Plus, women love The Secret, so it might give you something extra to talk about!

It's not complicated, but that doesn't mean it's easy—but I promise it's going to be worth it.

Finally, remember to treat people with respect. Don't give people false ideas about your intentions, don't cheat  and don't lie.

So you can either get a hotel, or pull an all nighter and find something to do. Obviously you can go to music clubs and bars, but what are some other things to do? Here are some of mine

Round1.
https://www.round1.co.jp
Probably the biggest arcade you have ever seen with arcade games, pool/billiards, bowling, indoor sports, karaoke and more. You can buy basic alcoholic drinks and food as well. Easy way to spend an all nighter

Karaoke.
You can go to the big ones all around Tokyo, in which you will typically get a room for your group. This is especially good if you're out with a group of Japanese people, makes it more fun. If you're out with your gaijin friends and not necessarily good singers, then I recommend something a bit different.
At himawari studio, you can sing along with two musicians who will play your song. The place is pretty small, and can get very packed at times. It's essentially one room full of people taking turns to sing.
https://himawaristudio.owst.jp/
Open mic at Ruby. A good place to meet people. I think it's only in Tuesdays though?
https://rubyroomtokyo.com/open-mic/
I'm sure there are more but these are the only ones I have been to. Any one have other suggestions? 

Snack bar.
These are the typical salary man hang out in Japan. For most, you need to speak Japanese to attend and should go with a Japanese person. At a snack bar, mama-san will serve you drinks, food and hang out with you and the other guests. Usually a mama-san is the owner in their 50s or older. Many snack bars also include karaoke. Most that I have been to are outside Tokyo in other prefectures. Does anyone have recommendations for good ones in Tokyo?

24 hour onsen.
Most onsen are outside of Tokyo but you can find bathhouses that use onsen waters or just regular bathhouses. If you're on the outskirts of Tokyo, you can generally get pretty cheap entry of about 1000 yen. This includes soft drink or tea and coffee. At Tokyo dome you can find laqua, which operates 24 hours but becomes more pricey at later hours.q


Net cafe.
A good way to spend the night especially if you're alone. They are open 24/7 and can be cheaper than getting a hotel. Many have a variety of choice on the facility, e.g small cubical, booth (some for more than one person) or even room. Internet cafes obviously provide internet, but they also provide a lot more, like access to games, manga, showers, food and drink etc. You can find internet cafes all around Tokyo, usually with a sign saying "" internet"" or ""internet cafe"" in English

Late night cinema.
Many big cinema companies have a late session in Tokyo. Last late session is usually around 2am.

Oppabu (oppai-pubu).
Yes breasts bars. If you're into this sort of thing, then pretty good prices for all you can drink and touching breasts. Expensive for more than 1 or 2 hours though. I posted about pink tiger in Ueno in a seperate post

1hylx30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hylx30/i_watch_the_coyote_it_watches_me/,I watch the coyote. It watches me.,"My name is Melanie. I’m twenty three years old and I’m clinically depressed. Not pulling for sympathy here or anything, just stating a fact. I couldn’t tell you when it started and I don’t think it’ll ever end. I’ve mourned a lot in my twenty three years and I’d like to think it shaped me into the shell of a human I am today. My daily functions are toggled like that of a sim’s. Going through the motions and doing only the things I know are essential to my survival, though, I’m not really sure what my purpose here is. They say grief gets better with time. That one day, it won’t hurt as much. That’s bullshit. The feelings of grief come and go like waves lapping the shore. It begs the question, if it always comes back does it ever really leave? 

I’d been to two funerals before age twelve. Both distant relatives that I hadn’t seen since I was a toddler. Their passing, specifically, didn’t thwart me much. However, the process of a funeral, an open casket, my little feet padding closer to a dead body, it was as if my consciousness began there. Where some saw a celebration of a life well lived, I saw the black and unforgiving maw of death through the eyes of a child. 

It’s safe to say I wasn’t the same. Anxiety taunted me at night and I spent four years sleeping on the floor in my parent’s bedroom. My mom was my comfort and my dad was my protector. As long as they were by my side, I’d be okay. 

“Shelia is getting a horse?!” My ten year old self exclaimed. I’d been lost in the rain droplets on the car window, choosing a particularly supple drop with my index finger. I traced it as it raced down the window towards the finish line, worthy opponents on all sides. But my focus on my champion was snapped by my parents speaking in hushed tones. I heard Shelia, my mom’s friend. And I heard horse. 

“No, Mel, not a horse.” My dad replied in tangent, earning a look from my mother I’d only seen before I was scolded. My parents locked eyes at the red light, seeming to have some sort of telepathic conversation with their eyes. They did that a lot. My mom sighed then, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Shelia is getting a divorce.” 

“What’s a divorce?” I asked. I’d never heard the word before. I was an only child at the time with two doting parents so, can you blame me?

“A divorce is when a husband and a wife, well, stop being husband and wife. They break up, essentially, and go their separate ways.” My mom explained, her words ringing in my ears as panic increased in my naive heart.  

“You and dad won’t get a divorce right?” I asked, the words spilling frantically from me. It never occurred to me that this was something plausible. Shelia’s daughter, my friend Megan, must’ve been going through the worst of times. 

“Sweetheart no, your mother and I are very much in love. It’s true love, in fact. You know nothing can stop true love.” My dad reassured me and my mom smiled. I was at ease. My dad was the king, my mom the queen, and I their one and only princess. My life was perfect. Divorce wouldn’t tear my family apart and with them by my side, I’d be okay. 

How stupid of me. Two years later I’m seated on the couch with my mom, our dog curled up in between us. My dad, seated on the loveseat in front of me, is offering up platitudes and reassurances. I hear what he’s saying and it registers in my mind…but it’s like watching the news during a tragedy. The reporters spill information out and the tv drones on but you become awash in some dreadful emotion that tugs you down like a swift current. You can drown while sitting perfectly still in your own home. 

“I’ll still be there for your cross country meets and band concerts.” 

It hadn’t even been a full twenty four hours since my mom found out, and my dad was already slipping from me the way the sun dips behind the clouds. I wanted to shout at him, scream at him, curse his name, and maybe even slap him. But I simply said, “Okay,” while glancing down at my hands, my torn up nail beds. 

I’ll spare you the gory details as much as possible, but it’s bleak. My dad had cheated on my mom with my children’s minister at church. A kind woman I’d come to trust over the years, as I’d frequented that church since I was a baby. The coming months were messy. My dad found new living arrangements. I tried to put on an excited face for him and his new house but all I felt was dread. Then, a few weeks later, the big one happened. What could be worse than adultery, impending divorce, and separating households you might ask? A pregnancy. My forty two year old mom was unexpectedly pregnant. The pregnancy itself was nothing short of miraculous. My mom shouldn’t have been able to have anymore children. She’d had some procedures, emergency cyst removal, and was down a whole fallopian tube. So somehow, in the midst of our shared anguish, my mom and I had to navigate uncharted territory entirely. 

Little did I know, at the time, my baby sister would be our salvation. She arrived early, like I had, entering this world with a round head, a button nose, and a shock of strawberry blonde hair. She breathed life back into me and my mom. Our days were busier and there wasn’t time to focus on the bleak, melancholy of it all. At thirteen, I held my infant sister in my arms, teary-eyed with my cousins at my side. At twenty three, I’m watching her run towards me off the school bus. 

“You’re in pajamas again.” She says, sidestepping me to reach for the doorknob. 

“Astute.” I reply and follow her into the house. Our routine hardly changes. I wake up around noon, wait for her to come home, she gets a snack and goes to read or watch tv, and I just…exist. Sometimes, I’ll remember to eat. Sometimes I’ll listen to a podcast while doing laundry, creepy stories droning through my headphones, sometimes I’ll draw. Or, most days, I crawl back into bed and lie still until my mom gets home. When she does, we’ll talk for roughly twenty minutes and I’ll revert back to my room and glide under the covers once more. Like I said, you can drown while staying perfectly still in your own home. I’ve lost a lot that I will never get back. My grandparents on my mom’s side, to old age. My grandpa on my dad’s, to cancer. My cousin, to suicide. My baby, to miscarriage. My dad, to another family. 

When you don’t see someone for a while, you start to forget their face. In my mind, it’s like in anime, where an unimportant character you won’t see again is talking and the top half of their face is blackened out, the animators not even bothering to draw any detail above the mouth. You’ll forget smile lines, forehead wrinkles, tattoos, things like that. If enough time passes, even their voice is lost on you. 

The house is dark now. I stand in the kitchen absentmindedly filling my cup with ice, then water. It’s snowing, in Tennessee, our one snowfall of the year. It collects and piles on the grass outside and if I stand close enough to the glass back door, I’ll feel the cold air on the other side of it. The house is quiet and empty. My mother and sister are on a trip with my sister’s cheer squad. I stayed behind, I don’t do well on trips anymore. 

When you float through life aimlessly you aren’t as privy to things. My focus is never wholly on anything in particular, and what a more alert person might pick up on, drifts past me like a winter wind. 

My corgi is on high alert, snapping me out of a daze. Her ears flatten against her head, her little body standing at attention by the back door. A low growl emanates from her. 

“Dude, hush.” I tell her. She’d bark at a leaf if the wind stirred it. Another low growl escapes her and she stands stock still. I sit down on the couch with a sigh, drape my blanket over my legs, pick up my ipad and stylus and resume my drawing. I begin to shade my sketch, losing myself in the process and droning out all other thought but my art. After a while, I glance at the stove clock, half an hour has passed. And my corgi is still standing at attention by the back door. “Come here Winnie.” I call to her, patting the couch. Usually, that sequence incites a rush of paws and fur into my lap and an excited pup in my arms. Not now, not this time. Her pointed ears flatten again and she whines, not a growl, but a whimper. The dim lamp light beside me flickers and the bulb hums and buzzes before the light it gives off dies out entirely. I move from the couch and scoop Winnie up in my arms, glancing over my shoulder to the yard beyond the glass. I live in a sprawling neighborhood, with homes so close together you could throw a rock and hit at least a few in one go. My neighbors all conveniently have fenced in yards, with six foot gaps in between them on all sides. We could afford our house, not the fencing. Animals traipse to and fro in our yard often. My large neighborhood is bordered by thick, dense woods. It’s not uncommon for me to spy a rabbit or two during the spring, or a doe and her fawn on the outskirts of the running trail in front of the neighborhood. So when I see an animalistic silhouette, I’m not alarmed. 

“Geez dude, it’s just a-“ I flick on the backyard light. It only casts a little light into the space, illuminating sparkling snow and Winnie’s paw prints. The light falls just short of whatever is out there but it’s unmistakable to me now. Glowing eyes peer into the glass door set above a hewn snout. Dark lines of the animal’s slender silhouette reveal perked up ears, gangly body, and a puffy tail. A coyote, not uncommon for these parts, I’m just grateful I hadn’t decided to let Winnie out for a bathroom break. “It’s just a coyote.” I tell her as she wriggles in my arms. “It can’t hurt you in here.” I tell her again, opting to take her upstairs to my room, lest the coyote provoke her malice once more. 

After an hour, Winnie tires herself out in my bed, splayed out with her back legs in the air, sound asleep. By this point, it’s around eleven pm and I’m far from tired. I make my way downstairs and fiddle with the lamp. The bulb isn’t just burnt out, I realize, it’s completely blackened from top to bottom. I head to fetch a replacement from the bin in our garage, passing the kitchen and the glass door to my backyard as I go. I stiffen, sort of halted in that middle space of my home. I turn my head, that deep innate fear that I’m being watched isn’t easily ignored. A dark blanket of unease falls over me like a billow of snow that glides off the roof when it begins to melt. I cast my gaze through the glass door and see the coyote, its position unchanged, save for the fact that it was now seated on its haunches and staring directly into my home. 

“What the fuck?” 

I should preface, I am google’s strongest soldier. After retrieving a new bulb from the garage, and locking eyes with the ever present coyote as I pass through the kitchen, I tap away at the keys and in a moment I’m presented with a more logical explanation. Coyotes are opportunistic hunters that often prey on small animals, including small house pets. Winnie had seen the coyote and it had seen her. Surely, with the snow we’ve had for a solid week, prey is scarce. You won’t get my dog, fucker. 

I fall back into my comfortable pattern of drawing until my fingers go numb-thanks carpel tunnel syndrome-long into the night. Around two am, I call it, my eyes growing weary and exhausted. My phone buzzes on the coffee table. I answer.

“Hey Mel.” 

“Andre. Hi, how’s work?” My voice wavers slightly. That unease I felt before, I couldn’t shake, even now. 

“What’s wrong Mel? You sound sad.” 

“I’m not sad I’m just…scared I guess.” I answer, biting away at my cuticles, phone pressed to my ear propped up by my shoulder. “Hold on, let me put you on speaker.” I tell him. 

“Why are you scared, love?” His voice reassures me. Just his comforting tone alone is enough to make me shake off the anxiety. 

“I saw this coyote in the backyard. Well, Winnie saw it first.” I divulge. 

“Did she give it hell?” 

“You know she did. She didn’t scare it off, though. Her sausage body isn’t very intimidating.” I say, chuckling. I feel like I can breathe easier. “Just, being home alone for the weekend has me a little spooked, I guess.” 

“It’s okay. I’m here.” Andre reassures me. “And right when I clock out I’ll drive over and stay with you so you won’t be alone okay?” 

“Okay.” 

“I’m off at 4.” 

“I hate that they have you on graveyard shift now.”

“I know babe, but I need the money. I gotta go now or my boss will be on my ass. Just hang tight okay? Only a few more hours. I love you.” 

“I love you.” The line beeps and I set down my phone, wrapped in Andre’s hoodie, my restless mind at bay. 

The coyote is closer. 

I don’t know when it moved but it did. It’s only a few paces from the concrete slab outside the glass door, staring at me with wide, wet eyes, orange beady pearls that seem to slice through my gut. I’d only stepped into the kitchen to flick the house lights off…

I blink and it’s closer, right up against the glass. Its breath fogs up the window. For a moment, it does nothing, just silently huffs misty exhales. I watch the coyote, it watches me. I stare in abject horror as it leans its head back then bangs its forehead against the glass. Then again. And again. And again. The glass door now bloodied, I dart upstairs, slamming my room door shut behind me and sliding down the wood. My chest heaves, my paled skin breaking out in a cold sweat. What the fuck was that? My heart hammers in my chest with a ferocity so intense, it threatens to leap out. 

“Melly? Can I sleep in your room?” A voice softly begs behind my door. Lyla? It can’t be…she’s in Gatlinburg. I glance down at the hallway light leaking through the gap in between the door and the carpet. Sure enough, I see Lyla’s feet there, her penguin pajama pants at her ankles. I don’t have time to question it. There are times I could’ve been kinder to her, despite the fog in my head. I should say yes to sister sleepovers more often. I shouldn’t sleep the day away after she gets home from school. I should play with her in the snow more. She’s had nightmares before, calling out my name, screaming for me or my mom to help her. I don’t know when her and my mom got home, or why my mom never called to tell me, but that doesn’t matter right now. I open the door, ready to receive my sister with open arms and comfort her…but there’s nothing. She’s not there. 

“What-Lyla?” I pant, my voice rattling in my throat as I call out her name. Then my voice echoes back to me from the gap where the stairs are. 

“What-Lyla?” 

Fight, flight, or freeze is a funny thing. Before I know it, I’m tugging on a thick carhartt jacket over Andre’s hoodie, stepping into boots in my pajama pants and flying down the stairs. 

“Melly. I’m scared.” I hear her voice but I can’t see her. The glass door is open, just wide enough for a nine year old to slip out. The blood, it’s gone. The coyote, it’s gone. 

“Melly!! Melly help!!” Her voice is beckoning me from outside. I run through the back door, slamming it shut in my wake, enough to rattle the glass panes. I hear barking as I run, wild yelping and screeching. I follow Lyla’s voice, her wails, with each crunching step of my boots against snow. I have to find her, I will find her. I find purpose in this, at least. I’ll save my sister and I’ll be her protector, like my dad was to me. But I’ll never leave her side, not like him. 

I run until I’m at the edge of the forest. There’s no noise here. No chirping, no chittering, no barking, no Lyla.

Then, the forest explodes in a chorus of wails so loud I have to cover my ears, buckling to my knees in the snow. Harsh screeching and yelping all amalgamating into a violent, deafening melody. It slowly dies down and I hear a baby crying. An infant’s colicky cry. Then, a voice like a whisper begins pinging to my right ear, then my left. 

“Run.”

“Run.” 

“Run!” 

It’s odd, it propels me forwards, shaking off the snow clinging to my knees as I stand, how it sounds like my dad cheering me on at a cross country meet the day I hit my pr. I’d almost forgotten his voice. A sickly sweet scent fills my nostrils, causing me to gag.

“Melly!!!” Another scream. “Melly help!!!” I press on, deeper into the dense tree-line, thick snow crunching beneath my boots. “Lyla?! Where are you?!” I call out in sheer desperation, eyes darting between the dark trees, fervently searching for my sister. All is quiet, save for a single wail, this time it sounds like the call of a loon. Awoo-ooo… 

I nearly crumble to my knees but I press on, tears gliding down my cheeks and my neck with no abandon.

“It’s okay. I’m here.” His voice is soft and comforting, yet utterly monotone, no inflictions, nothing. I stop dead in my tracks. No, no, it’s not possible. Andre is at work, he is at work and I know this because he called me on his break. 

“Andre?” My head is on a swivel, but I’m utterly alone in the dense woods. 

“I’m here.” His voice calls from the left. I take a step towards it as fog rolls in, clouding the space. The moon in its grace, gives me a little light. About twelve feet away, I see a silhouette poking out from behind a tree, the outline of a man. A sigh of relief escapes me.  Andre. “I’m here,come here.” As I get closer, my eyes are pouring tears, the cold bites, threatening to freeze them against my cheeks. 

“Andre! You have to help me! Something took Lyla I-“ 
My mind is a muddled mess but I stop, as something primal and intrinsically prey-like in me, sends a flash of warning through my senses. His hand curls around the bark of the tree with long, gangly fingers. Half of his head pokes out from behind the tree. I can’t make out his face, just the outline, but he’s tall…too tall…and his arm that reaches across the bark and strokes the tree downward is bone thin. I back up a step. 

“I’m here Mel.” His voice calls out to me, not originating from the thing in front of me, but behind me. I swivel and nothing’s there. When I turn, whatever that thing is has vanished. The forest goes silent and all I can hear is the beating of my own, frantic heart. 

That’s when I hear it, another loon call. Awoo-ooo. 

“Melly!!” 

“Lyla!!!” 

“Lyla where are you-“ Long tendril fingers clasp over my mouth. I catch a glimpse of something fleshy and crimson with sagging tendons, veins, and red, bloodied skin pulled tightly to bone. Towering and utterly human in shape, but…inside out. 

Strange. There’s a gash in me and it’s pulling, pulling, pulling at something it shouldn’t. Oh…my intestines. I fall flat, a vhs tape in fallen snow, spilling its film in a tangled mess. 

Awooo-oooo… 

I smell the rot, the thick stench of my own gore. If I could just get home to Lyla I could’ve been more for her. Could she smell the rot all these years, my hollowed out shell? There is nothing left of me to love. Liar, liar, liar, I couldn’t crawl home even if I wanted to. My guts are spilled and splayed out of the cavernous tear in my stomach. I draw short breaths. I’m afraid. I’m sorry mom. I’m sorry Andre. I’m so sorry Lyla. If I hadn’t bowed my head to this illness my whole life, I could have been a better big sister…I could have been…I learn…I learn to die as I bleed out in the snow.

I've been using acespace for a while and wanted to branch out as well to other communities, hence this post! I'm 31 (nearly 32 next month) M from Brazil currently living in Portugal - 1,73m (5'8), looking for a woman  26-35 ideally from Europe so we can travel to meet each other at some point. Aegosexual/asexual, hetero and alloromantic with a passion for musicals, coffee, technology (nerdy stuff in general) and cooking. Trying to be more of the reading type and get some more movement in 2025.

The ideal person would love cuddling, hand-holding, kissing and general romantic vibes. Long conversations, quality time watching shows, playing games, travelling and just generally being around and sharing life. For me, sex is indifferent, so I'm open to that - I just wouldn't want someone with a high sex drive and don't expect me to initiate anything.

Because spending time and dates together are important to me, I don't mind a ldr to start, but we would need to meet IRL and somewhat frequent travel to be together - hence why I set more to Europe because it's easier to be from around here (and cheaper), but happy to talk to folks outside of europe if you have plans to coming here for instance.

A bit more about me: ambivert, so I can be really extroverted with the right people and in the right scenarios, and can also do it ""on demand"" but require quite a lot of resting before and after 😅 my introvert side is stronger for sure. And while I'm generally a homebody, I love exploring cities, events, museums, hiking, coffee shops, eating out. I'm all for activities outside the house as well.

I don't want kids, and while I don't mind religion if you follow something, I'm personally agnostic. Don't smoke, sometimes drink (mostly socially). INFP-T and an Aquarius.

\- **movies I like**: High School Musical, Scream, The Incredibles, Moulin Rouge, Past Lives, Dune, Turtles All the Way Down

\- **shows I like**: Heartstopper, House MD, The Last of US, Game of Thrones, The Bear, Severance, Ted Lasso, This is Us, Schitt's Creek

1hylsk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cork/comments/1hylsk4/bottlworks_a_terrible_student_accom_cork_a/,BOTTLWORKS - A TERRIBLE STUDENT ACCOM - CORK (a detailed review ),"OK how do I even start , I was so confused excited to come to cork and stay in this student accommodation, luxurious and aesthetic , starting off :
1) ROOMs 
Super small , not worth what you’re paying ,en-suite rooms ?? Super small the bathroom you just step in and you’re done it’s tiny, the rest of the common spaces are okay , they provide you with like basic appliances and stuff  , STUDIO rooms , knowing from friends who lives there , you pay around 400€/ week , yup you heard it right , PER WEEK and can’t even start to say how disappointing as they don’t provide you with any appliances, when asked upon , they just said management decided not to .
2. STAFF 
There are few of them that are good but the others are just blatantly rude and obnoxious ( feels racist sometimes as well) in particular the property manager , she’s always up your business and bothers you for everything . If you want “privacy” it’s definitely a myth around there . They do random “compliance checks” , inspections and so on , and mostly when everyone’s at college , so they have no issues walking in to your rooms , and even if asked , they’re ignorant to give you a proper reply and sometimes they won’t even give you a proper date or time when . 
There’s been at least 5 occurrences of a male staff entering a room unannounced or without prior notice .
3. ACCOMODATION ISSUES :
This was my condition all semester 
Frequent power outages , no water (drinking or bathroom) . no long-term solutions have been provided by the accommodation management, nor has there been any transparent communication regarding the causes of these outages. There is no explanation for what is happening, and no plan has been communicated for how or when these outages will officially be resolved. There has been very little accountability whatsoever demonstrated from management. At least one student, anxious and exhausted after repeated broken promises of electricity being restored, elected to book a hotel room, taking a considerable chunk out of their already meager student budget.

Many of the services that were promised as part of the rent package are either not functioning properly or completely unavailable. These issues include:
	•	Rooftop Terrace Access: The rooftop terrace has been closed without any explanation or timeline for when it will reopen.
	•	Heating Problems: Radiators are malfunctioning, leaving some students without heating for weeks after moving in.
	•	Limited Bike Availability: The “free use of bikes” is misleading, as only 13 bikes are available for the entire building, with no clear communication on how to access them. Many students didn’t even know they existed, and most bike racks remain unused.
	•	Coffee Machine Issues: The “free unlimited coffee” is limited to one frequently broken or empty machine.
	•	Frequent Fire Alarms: Fire alarms go off repeatedly without warning or explanation.
	•	Poor Quality Furnishings: The room furniture and fittings are cheaply made and poorly installed—floors dent easily, countertops stain, bedframes are flimsy, closets have unfinished openings, and there are paint smudges and fragile shower doors.
	•	Missing Items and Inconsistent Rooms: Some studios are missing essential items like blinds and shelves. 
	•	Misassigned Rooms: Several students were placed in accessible studio apartments instead of standard ones. These accessible rooms are smaller, have lower countertops, limited storage, and hospital-style bathrooms. No prior notice was given, yet students are charged the same high rent despite the differences.

All in all , personally they are all nice and warm in the beginning then start being invasive as hell and literally exhaust you and ruin your mental health ; Of course unless you are European or Irish , they are lowkey racist and unfair . 
So yeah choose wisely lads 🙌🏼",4,1736562350.0,cork,0,1.0,False

I went to the registrar's office to ask a simple question, and they acted like answering me was the biggest inconvenience of their life. If you don’t want to help students, why even work there? The same goes for the TAs in the labs—they’re so impatient! If you ask a question twice, they act like you’re wasting their time, and their explanations are so bad I end up relying on ChatGPT or YouTube to understand anything. Ever since the semester started, I’ve had so many questions for professors, but I’m too scared to ask because I feel like they’ll just shut me down or embarrass me. That’s why I’ve never gone to office hours or talked to a single professor.

It’s not just academics either. Even the Tim Hortons workers on campus are rude. I’m literally paying for my coffee, but they act like I’m asking for a favor. One of them even said something rude about me once, and it made me so mad, but I just smiled and walked away. And today, I bought a cookie, and it gave me such a bad stomachache I ended up throwing up in the washroom.

This university is exhausting. I’m not here for free—I pay tuition, I pay for the food, and yet I feel like I’m treated like an inconvenience everywhere I go. It makes me miss high school, where at least teachers cared and wanted to help. I see other students dealing with the same treatment, but no one says anything about it.

Tiger Sport 800 vs ‘24 900 GT Pro vs ?,"I’ve got a history going back 15 years with Triumphs and I love em to death. What a brand… Speed triple (pre ‘10), brief stint on a Trident after a 5 year break and now my fav heritage bike in the lineup, the ‘21 Speed Twin 1200. o make this move I’ll prob have to let the Speed Twin go.

I’m a weekend warrior, looking to chase some mountain air overnights and longer 200 mile days a few times a month. I may peak at gravel some day, but haven’t done any yet…so there’s that.  Occasional coffee run or commute in traffic more likely than dirt.

I live in the SF Bay Area and test rides have been near impossible to line up on the GT Pro, none for rent but there is a sweet deal that gets me in the ‘24 GT Pro for several $k under the msrp (clearly a making room for the ‘25’s). Even with that though, the GT is $6k more that I’ve ever spent on a bike.

I don’t ride too spirited these days and never had a bike with as many creature comforts as the GT. The allure of even a windscreen + heated grips + cruise control + luggae  has me thrilled. Hitting. My late 40’s has me thinking a bit differently about how to keep my favorite hobby going!

The release of the Sport 800 has me paused a bit of maybe waiting. I’m also wondering if that the 900 will soon go goodbye from the lineup…Not sure what to do. 

Concerns I have it quite honestly, will I be bored on the 900 gt pro’s power delivery? Will it be too heavy for lane splitting and will it be enough of a touring bike vs the 1200? Not a bad review out there on the bike..maybe it’s just the price that is slowing me down. Any words of advice?

So the situation back in that awful cavern, for starters it was nearly impossible to see outside. Legitimately, the wall of darkness facing us was so thick you could maybe see a few feet. Night vision displayed… Well, let’s just say there were a lot of them waiting out there for us. Blackburn cursed as he continued to try and key into the radio, both of us by the front entrance as we heard the gathering storm outside. Theoretically they could just burst in, tear us apart, and rewire our souls to become apart of them and the New Advent, however in old customs it’s stated some vampires cannot enter unless being invited, spirits as well.

Maybe this was some sign of their old world customs still binding them. Maybe they just couldn’t figure out how to open a door.

Either way the marshal sat back against the rock wall and took off his hat, the both of us sitting in silence as he let out a long exhale; “Ain’t this a fuckin’ tizzy” he said. He looked to the door, then back to me “No comms… figures cause we’re at the epicenter of this shit, but if we don’t get ourselves going? We’ll be with them soon”.

12 civilians, a march the better part of at least a kilometer, against all of that adversity. We needed to move, however doing so was suicide and yet staying here was slow death. It’s like being dealt a bad hand at the poker table, but we can only hold for so long- eventually we’re gonna have to play.

Now some of you who might have known me for a while might ask what exactly Isaac and I caught up to… well we were in that cave for several hours, initially trying to see if we could physically wait out the darkness. Nothing… worse so time was standing still; It was 1:28am for what felt like hours. During that time while Niyol and Matsoi checked our rescued persons for injuries, Zeus was sleeping in the corner, and I sat down on a couple of old chairs and talked with the single person I’d recognized.

“The hell are you doing here?” I asked, completely astounded that Isaac was here, after six long years of not seeing him. “Oh you know… well, you don’t, I guess, that’s why you asked. No so I was just going about my day…” he says, before stopping, his single eye seeming to glance off. I waited for a moment before asking; “Isaac?”.

Then he said the most off putting all decade: “Okay weirdest thing, I can’t remember”. “You can’t remember?”. “Nope”. “Isaac it has been six entire years, how can you not remember?”. “Well I can remember some portions…” he says scratching his chin: “I’d worked down at the local gun store, you know the one run by those two europeans? Yeah… I was there for a while, started talking to this one lady and then one day she stopped… being there”.

I raised an eyebrow “What?”. “Yeah… a lot of people did, that town you did all that work in? Yeah so I noticed when traffic started getting easier to navigate, heh… okay yeah, bad joke. No but then… I don’t know… I just remember the night sky getting darker, one day I found myself walking out of town…” he said, hands slapping his thighs and giving me a thumbs up like somehow that answered… anything.

The long minute of silence told him that didn’t really solve anything, he scratched the back of his neck “I… tried to talk to Rosanne, you know the occult woman in town who… exercised rivers and talks to trees-”.

“Yes Isaac I know very well who Rosanne is” I say sternly, to which he feigned throwing up his hands “Well I’m glad to see you’re still you, Staff Sergeant”. From across the room, Blackburn spat some of his dip into an empty can he’d been keeping nearby “He’s not the military anymore, guy”. Isaac then turned in his chair to him “Listen: Once a staff sarge, always a staff sarge… so…” he then turned back to me “Staff Sausarge… what’s been keeping you?”.

I explained to him the offer I had gotten from PEXU all those years ago, and generally recounted some stories up until then. Isaac would make such intelligent commentary like saying loudly “Wait you fought a Wendigo?!”. I remember distinctly Matsoi’s wife slapped him upside the head, from the way he responded I guess they got acquainted while in that cell. Something was bugging me though and I asked “Wait… you said you tried to contact Rosanne…”.

That’s when… yeah, there was a look in his eye when he said it: “Didn’t work because… she disappeared first”.

These were things that would need to be handled later, but they were, for now… I had a close friend back that I hadn’t seen. For those who aren’t acquainted with Isaac, I’m fairly certain my old blog series might still be up. Regardless… the five of us: Myself, Blackburn, Matsoi, and Niyol, and even Isaac huddled up. The Marshal was adverse to Isaac as he eyed him, looking back to me “You trust this fool?”.

I looked to see what he was… Isaac was having a conversation with a cave painting. I sighed “Yeah… let’s just say when the going gets… going, he’s very capable”. That being said I don’t know how Isaac had fared the last six years so… time for a reintroduction I guess. John simply looked at the Idaho native remarking: “Well bless his heart”.

All of us convened over the table with Blackburn starting us off “We have got to get moving, those things out there are surrounding us”. Isaac chimed in saying “Well I mean, we could always just wait out the storm. The sun will be here soon”. A few of us looked to Isaac as John rolled his eyes “Ain’t happening, son, that darkness is eternal”.

Isaac stopped his chuckling with a “say what now?”.

“We’re at the epicenter and caught in the snare, however our only exit out is currently directly into their maelstrom” Matsoi said looking back towards the entrance. Niyol chimed in “Not the only one” and proceeded to walk over towards a large old wall of the mine, he then punched through some of the rotten boards, and we helped the medicine man uncover an old forgotten passage way. He explained “This used to be the only passage up before the road around was created, they seemed to have not found it. It will cut our travel to our vehicles in half. From there it’ll still be a half of a kilometer journey to our vehicles”.

“Will we be out of… whatever this is?” I asked, Niyol nodded, I looked to John “If we’re not in some sort of snare… we can easily handle whatever’s there for a few hundred meters”. We consolidated all we had, designated able bodied persons to carry any of the children or help the elderly, I prepped my night vision as Isaac walked up: “So… I don’t suppose you’ve got any firepower for me?”.

I looked to Blackburn who was placing half a lip of what could be his last can in his mouth “don’t you fuckin look at me-”.

I sighed and handed Isaac my glock and the magazines for it “Don’t lose it, and make them count, keep them off the-”.

“Keep em off the civics, don’t worry, I’ve got you” Isaac said, shoving the magazines into the pocket of his flannel. “Isaac you are a fuckin’ civie” Blackburn muttered, to which he responded “I am an experienced monster hunter… I saved Nolan’s life”. Blackburn looked to me unconvinced to which I confirmed “A few times, actually”.

This seemed to settle the Marshal’s grievances as we prepped. I led first with my kalashnikov leading the way, the dark, ancient tunnels of the navajo were as eerie as can be as the illuminator of my laser traced every possible hiding spot under white and blue night vision. Just behind me I could hear Isaac and Blackburn, Matsoi and Niyol took the rear guard to make sure no one fell behind, Zeus kept to my side the entire way.

Then… the sound of wind could be heard as the faintest moonlight crept in around a corner, Isaac and I quickly cut the distance and panned out and saw a dark horizon but… filled with the tiniest specs of stars. Zeus’ ears were back as he let out a low growl for what laid ahead. We could hear nervous muttering from the rest of the people as they followed us like new age shepherds, Niyol panned out sighing “We are just barely at the edge of it’s presence… where is our vehicles?”. I quickly checked my ATAK, flipping the device back closed: 465 meters, due our 11 o’clock.

“Alright… let’s go” Matsoi said, quickly we all moved as fast yet as discreetly as we could, with only the slightest wind around us in that black and indigo covered desert landscape it seemed as if everything created sound. Yet… we kept moving, finally our vehicles were within sight. That’s… when we heard it.

The most gutteral, bone shaking roar I’d ever heard that sounded both in the distance and right behind us called out. With our two vehicles in sight I shouted: “Matsoi, get them loaded up, go!! Go!!”. I quickly cut to the back to provide any covering support as the herd of people led by Blackburn and Matsoi moved, I checked around for Niyol. The Medicine man was back helping a young lady escort an old woman, one of their town’s elderly, he had barely noticed the presence behind him. He turned to see… what looked like a female lead from the dark, with a single slash some sort of foul substance coated his eyes causing him to scream.

“Contact!!” I shouted instinctively as I centered my laser on her and fired, a series of bright 7.62 flashes punctured her and caused her to roar as she melted back into the black. Immediately I raced over to Niyol as Zeus barked off at whatever it was, I grabbed his hand and pulled him to his feet. It looked like oil although I swear it moved as he brushed it off his eyes, her strike had cut his skin and his eyes were a mess of blood and… it. “Can you see?” I asked, he used his rifle to push himself up “barely”.

In my peltors I heard John yell “We’ve got contacts up here!!!”. We raced to see Blackburn firing off at shadows in the distance, the marshal was putting in work with his heavy lever action as Matsoi fired off his short barreled AK. What seemed to be a… dog with far too many appendages broke towards the Marshal, he fired but his rifle went dry. As it leaped at him he quickly jutted it’s muzzle forward, impaling it into the thing, he then quickly hip fired his pistol. Several shots as it screamed and pulled off him, before he loaded that thing like lightning and began firing again.

Isaac and I escorted the medicine man and the last of the civilians into the vehicles when suddenly, something broke from the dark. It had antlers, rippling muscles yet somehow a lanky body. I quickly fired at it and it ducked away as I could see parts of it torn off. Another came from the opposite direction, and I could see Isaac firing away with his pistol. Just then, I turned to see one of them had somehow closed completely on top of me. I fired my rifle but it pushed the barrel out of the way, shots firing all over the horizon before my gun went dry. I pulled my weapon away, the thing had red eyes, that much I remember, several jaws all over it’s body, I remember muzzle thumping my AK into one of them and pinning it to the ground. I then reloaded as I kept it pinned, before firing into it as it writhed.

“Sarge, we’re good, let’s go!!!” Isaac yelled as he and I ducked into the back of the pick up with several of the people. I took a knee and maintained cover as I whistled, Zeus proceeded to leap almost 7 feet off the ground to land inside, crashing into several of us. As we pulled off… I could see them watching from the shadows.

We weren’t done yet, not by a long shot.

Despite this the sight of a bright sky of night time stars and the moon was a boon to our morale. Our small convoy pulled back in front of the police station, Matsoi was helping Niyol out, as the people quickly left the vehicles, being greeted by several others. I scanned around to see several residents had come out of their homes… including the mayor. Though to be honest I was too busy pulling off my helmet and catching my breath as I sat on the cab of the truck, Isaac pet Zeus.

There was misery and merriment, all of which was silenced as the mayor shouted in Navajo as he approached Niyol and Matsoi. From what I could see he kept gesturing to his watch, I then decided to check mine and I realized why he was so angered- we had been gone for several days.

Matsoi then pointed to the Marshal and myself, the both of us dropping down as we approached Altse. “He tells me you were… ambushed” the mayor said, calming himself. “Shit… we were fuckin’ trapped… it’s way worse, you don’t have infiltrators, you got a whole god damn invading army” Blackburn barked. I nodded, there was not much more I could add but; “we barely got out with everyone we had… the New Advent’s laid their claws in your home, sir”.

Matsoi then nodded “they were giving their bodies as vessels, all we found of them were husks, and that was nearly a dozen… who knows what crawled out of them!!”. It seemed the mayor had been calmed and brought onto the same page, he looked around and asked “what happens now”. Matsoi seemed stumped as he controlled himself, finally having seen the proof of his woes he… stopped, genuinely he probably didn’t think he’d get here. Blackburn looked to me “You know what I’m gonna suggest”.

The mayor raised an eyebrow as I stepped forward “Sir… they’re coming down from that Mesa, and they’re gonna besiege this place. You’ll have more of those things here than you will living people. My advice? Get everyone to the best defensive position and we call in a PEXU SMU, your people may not have wanted a full unit down here, but-”.

“But you got enough creepy crawlies down there to usher in the new rapture, and they did a number on your guy over there and he’s custom made to mess up witches and wendigos” Isaac said from the bed of the truck. Altse seemed to pause for a moment before asking “Who… are you?”.

“Isaac, friend of the staff sergeant” he said with a smirk and pointed to me. “He… might’ve worded that strange as hell, but he’s right” the marshal said. The mayor looked around, allowing a moment for time to stand till as he took a single exhale… he nodded and patted Matsoi on the shoulder. “Order everyone to the center hall, get them into the concrete cellar. Tell them all guns…” Altse ordered his police chief, which caused several of the male residents of the town to whoop and holler as they ran off. He then looked to Blackburn and myself “If you have any friends you can send? Get them down here, you have our permission”.

Roger fuckin’ that. I quickly walked off as I left my helmet and rifle in the truck, telling Isaac to keep watch, Blackburn pulled out his keyring; “I’ll distribute our goods, you get on the line and tell that brit to send whoever he can”.

I quickly fished out my SATCOM, hooked up the tripod and antenna, connected it to my personal radio and… \[“November-1 to main…”\]. There was nothing but static and silence, I tried again; \[“November-1 to main… radio check, any station on this channel this is November-1, radio check, over”\].

Finally: \[“... November-1 this is main, sitrep over”\]. I’d never been so glad to hear Montgomery in my life up until that point. I gave the down and dirty… there was a lot of back and forth, but I cut to the point \[“we need a full unit down here, there are far too many PARAFOR for us to handle”\].

\[“November-1, tonight there are several coordinated attacks, many of the units we had in the North American AO are tasked out. We may not be able to reinforce you, how copy”\].

I cursed, at this time some of the people and Isaac had seen, the latter kept watch as I barked back \[“Main, this is November-1, if you don’t get someone down here we will be outgunned, undermanned, and you’re looking at a worse disaster than Tipton… and the Navajo Nation vilifying us for it… how copy, over?”\].

After a moment of silence: \[“Wait one, over”\]. I stood there, staring into the sky wondering how long until the stars above disappeared like they had in the desert before finally… I got a response. \[“November-1 this is main, you have additional forces enroute. SMU Raider is approximately 45 mikes how, how copy?”\].

4th Special Forces Group. A detachment of green berets currently led by an old friend of mine, Nicholas Walker. Yeah… that’ll do.

\[“I copy all”\]. \[“November-1, send any new data, and good luck”\].

I quickly grabbed my gear and staged my vic near the center hall; a concrete building with vivid paintings of the people’s history spread across in chipped blues, orange, red, and yellows. If I wasn’t working off institutionalized muscle memory I might’ve taken a moment to stop, as the story of the entire Navajo people was laid out through better and worse times… I guess this was another chapter for them, what would happen next would decide if it would be a good one or not, but it wouldn’t be the final one.

The sounds of nearly four dozen people ushed down the stairwell towards the back of the building could be heard as I entered, what was a carpeted center room now had all of the furniture pushed to the windows and around the door in makeshift barricades. Matsoi and Blackburn quickly unlocked the equipment cases from the church. As the Marshal lined up at least a dozen incendiary and stun grenades, the Navajo police chief quickly unsealed some cases of ammunition; “You two brought more with you than my station’s stocks”.

I checked on Niyol, whose wife was busy cleaning his eyes, he raised his head instinctively to me “Nolan…. Are you friends on their way?”. This was also the first time he addressed me by my name in a non-insulting manner “Yeah, they’ll be here soon”. He seemed to resign to the situation, sitting back with his weapon on his lap “well… let’s hope this final alliance stands better than the last”.

Matsoi seemed to be working a mile a minute as he scanned around “Not everyone’s here… we’ll have to do this the old fashioned way and go block to block”. I grabbed my weapon, checking it as Isaac jumped to his feet “I’ll volunteer too, but two guys and a dog isn’t enough for a whole town”. That’s when we heard the door open, remember those townsmen who were all too energized to be called to arms? The nation’s people are extremely well versed in their old warrior skills as several were professionally armed with everything from a modern rifle to an old school bolt action, handguns, a chest rig, and all. Matsoi gestured to them “Dwight, my men will assist you”.

“Roger that… oh, one more thing… Isaac” I said, kicking over a gun case to him. He quickly opened it up, pulling out a Remington 870 that Blackburn had prepped with a side saddle, light, and extended tube. “Don’t you fuckin’ break it” the Marshal barked.

Last thing he said before grabbing a bandolier of shells was: “Wouldn’t dream of it, Calamity Jane”.

It was a strange feeling of the past, hoofing it down the dark streets with a vest and ACH with nods on, flanked by the armed locals as they quickly went door to door. Many of them knew who lived nearby, who would probably still be at home, we worked efficiently to comb the streets. The town wasn’t that large, we burned maybe 16 minutes before we were certain no one was around. Taking stock I stopped at an interaction as Isaac and the Navajo militiamen quickly posted up behind nearby vehicles, stone walls, around corners…

\[“November-1 to Bravo-1…”\] I said trying to reach Blackburn, I could hear him but it was… broken up. \[“D-....ht, we’ve …. signs of –c…ing, southside…”\] is all that came through. I looked around, our group getting restless as we stopped, I tried again… nothing. The same level of interference we had at the Mesa, I took a look up and sure… the stars were getting dimmer. Then… contact.

The sound of tearing metal could be heard as we canned the road nothwards, a wooden plank fence with old red paint was slowly torn apart as spindly limbs punched their way through. What pulled itself over and through was this amalgamation of what looked like calcified roots and tendrils, weaving together in some horrid round form. A single haunting face like that of a wax figure that was melted to where its jaw and chun melted together, poked through, it was at least 3 meters tall. Then… more sounds, from the gangways and yards, we were right at the head of an assault.

I immediately fired off a burst of rounds, firing into the thing causing a… reverberation, it felt like my skull shook. Several of the others were feeling it as they fired off, some aiming towards distant sounds; “Pick up, we’re moving!!!” I ordered. We tried a bounding retreat but elected to just turn and burn when we heard an additional noise directly to our right, the quick paced sound of metal being smashed, chain link being torn if that’s possible, something in us kicked in and we realized we were outnumbered and surrounded.

Despite this some of the navajo men laughed, one of them with a suped up AK like the one I was using firing off a few shots as I could hear muffled prayers under their breaths. I said one too… we were going to need it. I daringly took a look back to see that thing gaining on us, fast, and I mean really fast, it seemed to somehow be able to pull itself ten meters at a time. Suddenly one of the men at the front of the group had his leg snagged, he dropped to the ground as he and his weapon were dragged back. I grabbed his hand with my off hand, aiming my AK at the thing which was just halfway down the black. He screamed and I could see why… the tendril has metal barbs protruding out of it that dug into his flesh like a thousand fish hooks. As the sound of his skin tearing could be heard, Isaac placed his boomstock onto the thing and fired. The material tore away as it howled enigmatically… I helped the guy hop back along with another militia member as we hauled ass to the center hall.

“Open the hell up!!” Isaac called out as the doors opened and we bolted through. Quickly a designated “field medic” in the form of the town doctor took the man to a triage bed, quickly looking after him as Blackburn, Matsoi, and several others took to the windows. “I was trying to reach you, cameras been going dead all along the southside…” Blackburn walked over. I switched out my magazine; “We took contact from the north, John”.

“So… both ends of town closing in…” the Marshal noted. Then… the sound of something landing hard on top of the concrete building, causing the lights to flicker caused everyone to stop. Dust fell off the ceiling as Zeus was barking like a mad man, Isaac looked to Matsoi “I don’t suppose you got anyone on the roof”.

Then… almost instantaneously, the lights went out… I quickly flicked down my dual tubes, John produced a set of digital NVGs of his own as the both of us scanned around. Immediately the back up generator for the building kicked in as dim orange lights gave everyone else some light. Matsoi immediately shouted to his people, as everyone stood fast… then?

The laughing. I remember something like it back in the forests of Missouri, I don’t think what is out there has a concept of humor but they know exactly what rattles us. Like a chorus, both verbal through the shadows outside and inside our minds, suddenly the sounds of dozens of them crawling all on the outside. Suddenly through the metal places and furniture placed against them, one of the windows broke… then another. Then the doorknob started to turn as the howls began: “Stay put, they’re trying to off put us” I warned, looking around at the different entrances. “Yeah well, consider it achieved” Isaac quipped, taking cover behind a cabinet as he aimed his shotgun.

It’s then that Marshal Blackburn walked up to one of the barricade shaking his head; “Nah, not for me”. He then pulled the pin on a flashbang, throwing it just outside as he and some of the Navajo defenders took cover. Normally they’re not as bright as you see in movies, but due to the sheer black outside, it seemed like a flash of white coated outside.

It also gave us a small glimpse of them… all of them: contorted, demented forms as whatever they were destroying the physical… sense, the sanity of whatever they inhabited. Gaping maws, slender, yet ginormous forms. Their laughing stopped, and they started to roar, and yell…. Isaac was the first to fire as one of the entities tore through an entire cabinet, it’s arms lined with spikes, as it’s skin was missing, grey and lifeless. A blast of buckshot cast her back… at the other windows, the Navajo quickly took up arms and began to fire off, Matsoi commanding his people.

I was running through out, aiming my laser and taking shots to help where I could and fill gap. One of the militiamen had his shoulder cut when a hand, just a hand, reached through and grabbed hole… then proceeded to rip a chunk out of him like he was wet paper. I dragged him back to the aid area with Matsoi, reloading my weapon.

“Nolan…” a voice through all of the loud gunfire and yelling could be heard, I turned back to see the mayor, Altse… holding… Well first, he seemed to have thrown on one of his old digs. Old school BDU camo, green and black, a chest rig that the vietnam rangers used to rock as in his arms was an M60, gas operated air cooled belt fed machine gun. “Where do you need this?” he asked calmly. Blackburn fired off his lever action as he ducked back around the window to the wall. He looked up as he reloaded, pausing; “Where the fuck’s that been?!”.

“My property is my business, lawman… now, where do you need it?” Altse reiterated, just then the sound of something big began to slam on the front doors directly in front of us as I aimed my Kalashnikov; “Right here should do….”. Whatever was out there had the clean mass of a trunk as the concrete shook and even cracked at the edges of the front door. Zeus assisted by grabbing the neck of one of the things as it’s contorted skull poked in, keeping it in place as Isaac unceremoniously exorcized it’s skull.  Suddenly… the center doors came loose, the metal warped as one of them nearly fell off… a hulking mass of what looked like limbs started to crawl through, the thing in the road.

“Gun hot!!!” Altse yelled, with the M60’s bipod mounted onto a large trough box, he took aim and fired a burst straight through the metal. Blackburn and several others ducked back as the sound shook the building, red and white streaks tearing into it as black substance flew all around the door. Another burst, I took aim and assisted, as did the Marshal and several others. The king beast withdrew with a roar torn off limbs fell through the mess of metal that was the entrance. One of them twitched and began to crawl, causing one of the medics to panic as a knife was planted into the palm… by Niyol. “You back to shape, old timer?” Matsoi asked as he cleaned his blade; “just barely…”.

The things outside began to crawl around, shaking the building as they the sound of tearing metal could be heard… then, a sound from one of the walls. Matsoi’s eyes raised “They’re entering through the air system!!”. I took lead with several others, including Isaac, Zeus sprinted off towards the basement stares as the dim lighting was even worse. The cellar was an open concrete area, the townsfolk were huddling near the edges… we reached the bottom. Suddenly… through the HVAC unit we could hear something messily fall through and from the vent, it burst out. Miniature versions of the things began to spill out, messily, trailing their black blood behind them. One leaped for some of the civilians, however Zeus quickly leaped, pinned it down, and gored it. Another was skeet shot out of the air by Isaac who fired on the vent and turned it into a messy bottleneck for them. The Navajo defenders and I quickly took aim and fired, I stomped one before firing into another. One of them men grabbed one and whipped it into a wall as another jumped on his back, I took aim and shot it off with a single shot. Then… one of the last of those things leaped for me, I turned-... and saw it hit out of the air by a metal bat, then pulverized… by Matsoi’s wife who was guarding a group of the town's children.

“Careful, Staff Sergeant” she quipped. “Nice one, uh… Sarah, was it?” Isaac quipped, she rolled her eyes and responded with “Glad to see you’re still topside Isaac”.

“Technically we’re underground” Isaac said. “Shut up”.

From outside a loud noise could be heard, originally we thought it was yet another creature attempting to gain entry, but I immediately knew what that was. Aircraft, specifically a helicopter and the literal best thing we could hear at that point causing me to outright laugh and pump a fist. Isaac seemed confused “I don’t follow, those cultists didn’t give me a lunch, kinda light headed…”.

“That’s our back up”.

… \[Log-Addendum Added… Processing….\] \[Author: Captain Walker, Nicholas, SMU “Raider” of 4th Special Forces Group\].

I’ve been asked by the brass to give my perspective of our quick response deployment to the Navajo Nation, this is Captain Nicholas Walker. For those reading you’ll have to forgive me, I’m used to writing OPORDERs and debriefs, planning missions, and my after action reports are dry, but I’ll give as best of a retelling as to what the hell we encountered down there.

We were on QRF tasking when we had gotten the alert, we seem to be doing a lot of that… probably because our specific team of America’s finest happens to be able to adapt the best against PARAFOR and their unusual circumstances. Regardless, multiple alerts had been given out and some of our sister units in Canadian JTF2, 1st Ranger Batt’, even a unit of FBI HRT based down in Virginia had been spun up. The New Advent’s roots were tightening around us and missions were more frequent than the ‘07 surge. We expected something to pop off and give us a reason to roll out, I just didn’t expect it to be an old friend…

Montgomery’s words somewhat-exactly: “A joint mission to bring the Navajo onboard has gone completely bloody FUBAR, we’ve got several solos stuck down there with reality warping entities having tore a damn hole in the county. They’ll be overwhelmed if they don’t receive immediate assistance. Local liaison is the town’s chief Matsoi, solos tasked are US Marshal John Blackburn and Dwight Nolan”.

I’d recommended Xavier to bring Dwight in, especially after he went toe to toe with whatever the hell he found back in southern Missouri. He was an absolute firebrand of a squad leader back in our line unit, got it done but also kept his guys’ heads above water mentally. Him and I kept contact tangentially however I reached out after he joined with PEXU, and I wasn’t too surprised he started tearing through target packages left and right. He might not say as much, but from a cohort of his looking in… Dwight Nolan has eliminated cases as a solo than some groups of them fail to do in the greatest quantity.

So if his ass was in the fire… let’s just say me and my boys were suited up, radios prepped, and out on that tarmac before the coffee was hot. Our ramp brief laid out a clusterfuck ahead \[“Inward communications limited, OPFOR unable to be seen on ISR, drones unable to regain visual on town due to supposed ‘wall of darkness’... break”\]. I flipped my notes, keying back in; \[“Contact on entry is likely, though birds will take us in…”\]. I closed my boot and shoved it back in my rig’s pocket, eyeing one of the door gunners… an M134 minigun, chambered in good ol’ 7.62 NATO… I’ve seen those things bisect vehicles faster than you can register. If there’s one thing I’ve learned about my time with the unit, a healthy amount of well trained warfighters is equivocal to anything that crawls out the primordial asscrack of this universe.

We quickly entered the airspace of the town, our nods were down but we couldn’t make out a damn thing… legitimately. I knew what they meant by wall of darkness because the clouds soon vanished and a void is what greeted us. The crew chief came back to talk: \[“We’re still able to make out altitude, once you’re on the ground we’ll be unable to provide air support”\].

Not the best, though last thing we’d want is a blackhawk going down because it hit a damn light pole in a Navajo town. Try explaining that on the news, Xavier.

Soon we felt the rotors stabilize as gravity remind us we are still on earth, we exited right side, half crescent formation as we all took up sectors. Our comms sergeant chimed in, short range communications were still up… the leader of my alpha team, also the one who keeps you updated on 4th Group, SSg Ivensky, kept all sectors scanned. Our warrant kept look out with a thermal as the birds left us in total darkness and silence.

That was… until we could make out gunfire. The sound had the same effect as the cold, too much of it too far and it seems silent, but whatever was going down pierced that veil… our people were still alive. Our medic doc said something akin to “-Hell yeah, give ‘em hell”.

“Ivensky, have Alpha pick up, we’re fucking moving” I ordered. Our warrant kept chirping in my ear; \[“This matches stories I’ve heard about the Anaye”\]. We moved carefully as our quad nods had trouble piercing the darkness though we quickly made our way to one of the streets, we’d been emplaced on the north end of town. \[“The hell you talking about, chief?”\] I barked, keeping volume low.

\[“When they enter our world in great numbers, their entry way sucks all energy back into it… I see no stars and no sun”\] he noted. I looked around, he was right, though as he noted \[“That’s just the working theory”\].

Ivensky’s alpha team immediately snapped to action I saw them quickly take cover behind a nearby car aiming down the road as through the comms \[“Contact!! Five PARAFOR front!!”\]. I immediately hoofed it… sure enough; two that looked like hybrids of canine and corpses, some sort of marionette, all charged, talons, bones, reaching out as they closed the distance quickly. Was nothing we couldn’t handle, I saw peq lasers on targets, cutting them down even if it did require an entire magazine each. Another leaped from one of the roofs, though alpha’s gunner took it out with one hell of a burst… showered us as well.

Doc didn’t hesitate to complain \[“Dammit, I just got that West Tennessee shit out of my kit”\].

Bravo team bounded up as Alpha replenished and fell in… we could see the damage these things had done. Torn up fences, cars had been smashed though it seemed as if they moved quickly. Pieces of them, calcium, rotten flesh, flaked skin, littered the ground \[“Seems like the locals did a number”\] Bravo’s team leader, Sullivan noted, chief disagreed. \[“There’s no brass, this wasn’t a firefight”\] he noted, I looked over \[“So what’s your theory then?”\].

\[“They’re molting”\].

Soon we reached the center of town where the gunfire emanate, though as we approached from the east side of the center hall, we could see tracers and hear the whizz of outgoing rounds. We immediately hugged a nearby concrete wall, not wanting to catch blue on blue and become a folded flag. Our comms sergeant tried to reach them; \[“Friendly units inside, this is Raider-Romeo….”\]. Nothing, yet fighting could still be heard, one of our guys stupidly tried to peek around to see and nearly caught an AK round that tore off a chunk of the wall.

“Don’t lose your head, guy” was all I could say. \[“What’s the play?”\] Chief asked, they were barricaded, and from what we could assess carefully… multiple parafor along with a larger creature were around the entrances and possibly made entry. \[“Break the siege… Bravo deploy a starcluster and flare to let them know we’re not flesh eaters, Alpha bound out and we’ll take the center of the road…. Draw that big son of a bitch off the top of the roof”\].

Without hesitation Sullivan immediately slammed a silver canister into the ground, a bright burst of pyrotechnics bathed the road ahead as Ivenskyy’s team stormed out and took the center, posting up behind some vehicles. I rushed out, following behind to the far side as we saw… it… the thing was some mass of yarn, but instead of yarn it was limbs, spinal cords, and it face looked… otherworldly. Let’s just say, it had all the right functions to see, smell, and speak, and those forward facing eyes… all of them, told us it was a predator. It dropped off, limbs and flesh falling showing the damage as we engaged.

A burst from the belt fed, and our grenadiers immediately started to put rounds on target though I warned “Don’t hit the fuckin’ town hall with a 40-”. An HEDP found it’s place directly in the center of it’s chest, guts and entire bodies spilling out almost like we popped it’s sternum. We did… it rushed us, a swat and several calcified talons as big as .50 rounds nearly hit us. Yet… eventually… the thing began to lose balance, eventually falling as its centipede-like structure caved in. It still roared as we advanced, Bravo pushed right and fired on the smaller ones still at the building, while Alpha and I approached it. Its ring of eyes looked up, I aimed my SCAR heavy and put enough rounds to pierce its crown of a skull.

\[“Lead to all Raiders, advance to the center hall”\].

\[Log-Addendum ended\]

Seeing Walker and his green eyed devils emerge from that red and smoke filled street was the best thing we’d seen throughout this long well. Immediately there was crying, cheering, some like Blackburn slumped against the walls as Altse and I emerged. Zeus immediately ran up as Walker’s men took point, the captain flipped his quad nods up “Nolan… up shit’s creek I see”.

“Regular circumstances, yes”.

“You Special Forces?” Altse asked, Walker eyed the patches on the mayor’s jacket “Formerly 10th but yeah, you were at Stewart? Bless your soul”. I could see their warrant officer positioning guys, one of their teams quickly went around the building confirming dead parafor with two rounds each as their comms guy started to set up an advanced antenna.

That’s when Isaac caught up; “Is it true those things cost as much as a house?” he said, gesturing to Walker’s night vision. The Atlanta native eyed me then back to Isaac “More like a truck but yeah… who’re you?”.

“Isaac” he said, resting his shotgun on his shoulder. Walker then rolled his eyes “This one is Isaac? … Yeah, that tracks”.

…. Closing up now as there’s a lot of fallout from that. Our ties with the Navajo Nation have strengthened as that alliance baptism in fire has encouraged both sides to work together more closely. That being said it seems our victory’s gotten a lot of them pissed off, New Advent’s Ryan Evans just came on the news talking about a “new effort” to unite the people.

It’s going to get worse, before it gets worse. That being said, we’re in this for the long run.

Don’t believe their lies, hope isn’t dead even if it’s knee deep in a foxhole. PEXU works in the dark, and I’ll be back soon, with Isaac, Zeus, and the Marshal.

1hylkiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/scaryjujuarmy/comments/1hylkiw/an_occult_hunters_deathlog_part_7/,An Occult Hunter's Deathlog [Part 7],"Alright, we’re back. Well, not fully. Sort of-....

I’ll explain.

It’s been a minute since the end of our mission to the Navajo Nation. Truth be told, opening the car door to my driveway has never felt more tranquil… That was until I heard the passenger door swing open and I could hear every single vertebrae in Isaac’s back realign as he stretched. “Ah, home-sweet-ranch-compound, huh Dwight?”. Yes for the foreseeable future, noting our long absence from each other and his seeming inability to recall the last better part of a decade, I’ve elected Isaac can shack up at my place. Zeus has seemingly taking a liking to him, although truth be told that 90lb canine assault missile will take to just about anyone that will feed him.

Sorry back on track, we were looking at several weeks of downtime, which despite the fact that I should have been focused on recuperation… I could only think of piecing together what’s been happening. It’s a flaw of mine, once I’m hooked I have to see something through to the end… I guess that’s why I’m the maniac who didn’t run from the Cazamoth Estate and went to Afghanistan four separate times. Regardless we had some noncombat objective… or so it seemed.

“Hey Dwight, you like decorating your house with hand prints?” Isaac quipped, my mind immediately thought back to the print indent I saw on the gutter and porch post. “Yeah, don’t mind them, I’ll… it’s a thing” I said as I dragged my gear bag out of my trunk. Then something he said made the hair on the back of my neck stand up: “... All of them?”. What did he mean “all” of them? Well, I found out what he meant when I turned and… on the wooden railing, the steps, doorway, at multiple points on the glass were more hand prints. Coating the front of the house… I’d been gone for a few weeks, but this was new, this hadn’t happened before. I dropped my gear on the porch and looked at some of them, they were embedded just a few millimeters into the wood, the glass, even the stone… just enough to be noticeable. All of them were human like, four fingers and a thumb, but… I don’t know. They were cave painting is, archaic, weird… enigmatic.

Just like the traps that were warped and bent impossibly. Just like the hundred dead birds that passed inexplicably. … This was another probe.

The only thing greeting us besides the wind and Zeus’ sniffing and growling at some of the prints was the silence, all eyes were on us… That was until Isaac broke the air with an all too giddy: “Do you have a craving for property that’s got demonic intent or is this all just happenstance?”. Guess I’m just lucky.

Truth be told, getting used to Isaac again wasn’t too much of a challenge, to be honest between him and Zeus, having people around this place again was much better than absolute solitude. Though we had our fair share of weird moments, Zeus seems to be sticking to the area immediately around the house when he trots outside, there’s an eerie feeling I’ve been getting everytime I take my ATV out and scout the lands. Isaac’s been telling me the “walls are talking”, though that may just be the alcohol. Like, a serious amount of alcohol, we’re out in an isolated part near the rockies, where does he get that much- nevermind, rambling again, just like old times. The knocking… did I tell you guys about the knocking? Well, there’s knocking everytime I go to get the coffee. Sometimes its at a window, a wall, other times from the door, one day Isaac went to go confront it but I just told him: “Don’t answer it”.

There’s some things in this world you just don’t mess with, and I’ve got some hella’ spiritual blood on my hands. It will always probably be “weird” for the rest of my life, but I guess that’s just the parameters… the hand I’ve been dealt. Things were starting to get worse though… coyotes started to show up dead. Now it’s not unusual for Zeus to embrace his canine apex predator instincts and chase them down, then drag them back to the house to enjoy his kill right where everyone including the mailman could see it. What was unusual was for a whole pack of them to be left right at the bottom of the front steps, gutted brutally to where they were all peeled and ripped open, their blood and innards painting the front of the damn house.

I remember nearly stepping in when we went to go check, door slowly opened as I kept my glock to my right, Isaac had elected to creep out a shotgun and scan the front. “Okay, yeah, this place is definitely screwed, you ever think about relocating?” he remarked. Even if I wanted to, I don’t think this is something you can run from… I remember Zeus sniffing at the pile, only to back off and growl at it with his ears back refusing to eat any of it. We went to my office on the second floor where I had the entire property’s motion sensors, cameras, and surveillance set up… it happened last night, although no motion sensors triggered it. We found the point of appearance and… well.

2:17am; the porch is clear and everything is fine, night vision on my cameras gives us damn near a 360 view of the property and every inch of it from where the pavement turns to gravel, and then to grass. Then… it all appeared instantaneously: the dead coyotes, the blood to the point where some of the lenses were even smeared, all of it. Isaac and I zoomed in on the exact millisecond, opening maybe there was some cut off or something to show what happened…. Nothing. .01: it’s not there, .02, all of it. Whatever did this, didn’t do it through conventional means.

“What do you think it could mean?” Isaac asked, flipping through all of the cameras showing every angle of the carnage. I’ll tell you what I told him… something was sending a message, in the same way bodies are strung up at the front of bridges to ward off enemies this was the same thing. Isaac had a different theory, he pointed to an image of the pile: “The blood is one thing, but the bodies? They seem to be in the form of an… offering”.

I was dumbfounded and my face probably showed my confusion: “What?”. My Idaho alcoholic went on to explain: “Think about it… This is a crossroads, right, you got the Dakotas to our northish, west is red rock territory, south is Texas and Oklahoma, this is a merging area of all kinds of nasty shit, that’s why so many different things happen… We’ve seen uglies leave carcasses and stuff out as a warning, this… the way they’re like, placed all together like a meat wicker basket. Seems like they were presenting it to you. Gotta remember, things don’t work like people do”. If this is the way things worked, then it could happen on the opposite: just as something could show you respect, something else could target you.

We kept moving though; carcasses went in the trash and I took a power washer to the front of the house, and after some replacing of tiles, wood, the majority of the handprints were gone. I was tired of running and I wasn’t about to let anything scare or force me off this land, well, force “us” now I guess as this isn’t a one man circus anymore.

Likewise there’s been developments on the grander scale, more specifically the shadow war PEXU is embroiled in against our adversaries. You ever wonder who leads the Blackwood Brotherhood? It’s a question that’s been raised by many, while the New Advent has Ryan Evans we all know that man’s nothing more than a gray skinned puppet with darkness behind his wide toothy smile. After he appeared at that meeting where he addressed the world flanked by politicians from north and South America, Europe, leading figures in economics and big tech… an investigation was launched by the CIA’s Special Collection Service to track when this huge shift in momentum for them happened. They sorted through tens of thousands of emails, phone calls, texts, and found almost nothing relating to the New Advent at all.

Then… a singular message shared on an encrypted messaging app by some lower level informant shells connected to our adversaries sent everyone into a panic. “Belial”; in Hebrew it means the Devil, in the context they found it in it reignited a manhunt that had gone cold nearly 32 years ago. Believed to be the victim of a death camp in the middle east, he was being tracked by Israeli intelligence for quite some time after a special mission unit they sent to capture him all turned up dead. No wound, blemishes, nothing, just cold and unalive. After that he fell off the grid and ever since they it’s been nothing but theories connecting him to the primordial death cult we currently face: cells found in Denmark, Great Britain talked about an Augur from Damascus instructing them to revive the PARAFOR leading to shit we are still fighting to this day. Every connection from groups or training groups we get stops, no names, no ranks… just the tale of a man with dark red skin, sunken eyes and a bright white smile. His lips supposedly gone from acid burns that also line his body. Yet… it was all conjecture, drawings in scribbles of mad men who died when they allowed ancient shit to crawl out of their bodies like molted animals.

Until one single message: *“Belial will lead the way”.*

Then it all hit the fan: two operatives PEXU had with us, one from the agency and the other homeland security were found dead outside of a site that doesn’t exist on any manifest in the United States internal security directorate. No documentation exists because all of it’s funding is from black budget. The recovery teams assigned to retrieve them became casualties themselves as whoever left them there carved glyphs into their eyes… the same one the Blackwood uses for indoctrination. Shortly after? Deep in the Amazon ABIN, Brazil’s premiere intelligence network, was searching for a facility hidden in the rainforest connected to the cult. Attached to them were some members of the Special Activities Division… almost all of them didn’t make it out alive, half of them were grievously injured. A completely compartmentalized operation was compromised and ambushed… worst yet was the place they were hunting for disappeared. Every piece of metal, everything from the satellite photos was gone, like it never existed.

2 steps forward, 3 back into the woodchipper.

I won’t lie, my security office has turned into that of a makeshift war room with pelican cases and tough boxes lining the walls, a rack securing my armament, and a cork board of all I’ve learned complete with red string. The noose was tightening around our neck, 2 intelligence agencies experiencing major breaches, vew few within he FBI can be trusted and even MI6 needs to work in the shadows. Everyone from megachurches to corner stores is starting to wear those golden bands, and no one seems to be noticing. Not a peep or a whisper, anyone who does goes missing… 110,000\~ a year and counting, if even a tenth of that has been turned into vessels for ascension then we are neck deep in enemies. Honestly staring too deeply into it all laid out like that makes me nearly go mad sometimes, sitting back in an armory knowing that just weeks ago we fought through hell just to get ourselves an inch of breathing room.

“Oh lord, don’t tell me, you’re going insane aren’t you?” Isaac’s voice managed to draw me out of it with an eye roll as he walked in and took an eye at the board: “Hey Dwight, if you are succumbing to whatever MKUltra stuff they pumped into your veins, give me a heads up so I can get out of the blast zone alright?”. We seemed to stare at each other for a good long while as he took a step closer to he, chuckling “Ah! I’m just messing with yah, but for real, did they… put anything in your coffee? I mean you never drank coffee last time I’d seen you so I’m wondering if you’re the real Dwight…-”.

Isaac somehow manages to say so much and yet nothing at the same time. He leaned back against the wall next to it, crossing his arms “So, what now?”. I shrugged, I leaned back and grabbed my coffee that was sitting atop a palette of ammo cans “We wait until we hear more”.

“Oh come on! There’s gotta be something we can do, call up that Hogwarts fellow of your, Montana-”.

“Montgomery” I corrected him.

“Yeah sure, we can still do something, get back out there, hop in our supe-d up mystery machine and take it to ‘em!” he said emphatically, pumping his fist in the air. A supe-d up mystery that had the transmission blown to hell ever since I had to floor it over a sasquatch back in the Dakotas… more on that later.

“Isaac, we’re part of an organization… well, me, but-”. “I am too?!” Isaac said, I pinched the bridge of my nose realizing my mistake. “No, I am, you are unofficially by association”. “Still, how’s the pay?”. “Terrible”. “The benefits?”. “Worse”. “So what’s the incentive?” he asked, raising an eyebrow.  
“Duty”. “Oh god you guys really are insane”.

You think? Mortals using the modern day’s best armaments to cut through the hordes of wherever-the-hell to send whatever-the-hell back to where it was summoned from by other mortals. I’ve seen more of our people succumb to injuries that can’t be determined by our laws of universe than slashes and guttings, yet I still clock in. There’s definitely something wrong with me.

“I guess that gives us some time to think… or well, remember” Isaac said, rubbing his head. It was no secret his lack of memory was weighing on him, he does a good job putting up a front. “You’ve had no contact with anyone? Haven’t been back there in?…” I asked, his eyes snapped to me “Too long…”. We had ourselves, the cult, but then there was Theodore Cazamoth, my old boss who was obsessed with seeing how he could industrialize the primordial to advance humanity. “Advancement” that 4th Special Forces Group encountered on more than one occasion and lost more than a few of their own. We had been so dug in fighting a subversive apocalypse, what the hell was Theodore able to do the last 6 years?

We were going to have to find out… later. “I’m hitting the hay, let me know if some demon tries to tear our hearts out in the middle of the night, yeah?” Isaac said heading for the door. “Wilco, if you get the chance before me, dump my body down a flight of stairs” I joked. Isaac stopped at the door as he looked around, then back to me “Hey Dwight”.

“Yeah?”. “I’m glad you’re back”. The sincerity in his words seemed to sober me up, the same feeling that drew me back to this years ago… that’s why I keep marching on. Not insanity or money, duty… someone had to make the shit in the dark afraid, someone had to go in there and get vengeance for the grieving spouse, the crying child, the mourning parent, or those who went alone with no one to remember their name. I did… every single person I have gotten some pound of justice for.

I woke up later around witching hour to grab a water. Zeus stayed in bed as I headed downstairs with iron in my pocket just in case someone wanted to try. I rounded the bannister as I reached the bottom of my stairs, my front door just ahead of them as the entire living room was laid out with a couch, chimney, table and all… I stopped as my eyes snapped to the chair in the corner. I drew my pistol and tried to hit the light, nothing… my finger felt the rail underneath where it should have been. A light then shined on me causing me to squint my eyes, it aimed down as my eyes adjusted… it was my taclight.

“You rely on your equipment too much, Dwight Nolan” the figure sitting in the chair said, that of an impoverished male’s voice. The moonlight just barely missed them as shadows cloaked them, they tossed the taclight to me causing it to bounce across the floor. With my pistol still aimed I reached down and placed it back on and got a good lock at them. In a dark suit and dress shoes was a bald man, gray skin with dozens of stitches of different sutures lined their head. A black set of shades hid their eyes as on their lap they held what looked to be a chalkboard.

*“Dwight Anthony Nolan. 39 years old. Son, Leader, Killer…”.*

Tally marks were underneath, hundreds of tally marks… each one of them dark red, whispering to me. I knew what they meant… a name, an age, a birth and death date. Some were the things I had been ordered to cut down, target packages filled in the dozens… over a hundred. I looked to them, then back to the man; “Who the fuck are you?”.

“A watcher, numbers keeper mostly”. “You got some sort of point in doing this? I’ve got half a mind to-”.

“You’ve got a lot of blood on your hands” the stitched up freak said accusingly. “What? Sad I put down your friends? Or something in the woods, or the swamp, or across the ocean. I’m not gonna apologize” I growled, my finger well on the trigger as I started to apply force. “What about them?” it said staring blankly at me, pointing to another tally mark… Alyssa, Age 23, born in the Navajo Nation, died because we weren’t fast enough to reach her house to tell her to get to safety. It’s hand pointed to another… These weren’t just kills, these were people I had failed to save. Sometimes it was because I had a wrong lead, other times I was just too slow, some there was nothing I could do… but it was on my soul.

“Protectors have continued to form a membrane of annoyance for thousands of years, Dwight Nolan. We are closer than ever to shifting the momentum back to the era where you hid in the caves protected by a campfire and a stick” It said with glee in it’s voice. It was well aware of the pressure going on around the world, it knew that I knew as well… I didn’t give it an inch. “Well you won’t be there to see it” I said, pulling the trigger… the gun didn’t fire. I raised an eyebrow as suddenly I could hear pounding on the door that made my heart shoot straight into my throat.

“No, Dwight Nolan, you won’t. You didn’t really think hiding in the rockies would save you, would it?” my light went out… and I woke up in bed. That being said, I woke up to a chorus of alerts coming from the speaker on my night stand; \[“Multiple intrusions detected… multiple intrusions detected…. Condition Alamo, Condition Alamo, Condition, Alamo”\].

Something had followed us home.

Dossier: Condition Alamo Alamo… in every military there’s a contingency when deployed for whenever the wire is breached and the enemy has entered. The Poles I worked with liked to use the term Red, a Brit unit I worked with preferred Direct Fire Charlie. I’ve always stuck with one I’ve encountered at a number of American Fobs: Alamo.

Zeus was barking a storm as I could hear banging coming from the front door downstairs, for reference I bought a steel lined reinforced door with heavy duty hinges and several locks. That being said I had also gotten into scraps with things that cut through material tougher than it with no issues. I had minutes at most… I scrambled out of bed to find my pistol on my nightstand, drawing it and scanning around. Zeus was standing on the bed growling… the banging had stopped as I looked… no moonlight just like there had been hours ago.

I approached the curtains and peeked just under the edge to see, only to find an eye staring back. It was completely white, the iris gone with a pinprick needle for a pupil… my blood ran cold, I remember that kind of eye. I stumbled back and aimed my boomstick but only darkness remained. Then… laughter, dozens of different cackles, jeers, echoed from the outside… this wasn’t right, this… I had been here before, I had encountered something exactly like this… back when I was just a security guard hired to protect that fuckin’ forest estate.

Fuck this, we need to kit up quick. I opened the my door and shined my pistol light around, clear left and right, a few doors ahead of me were the bathroom and a study, directly to my right was the armory. I took a step out, watching the stairs down to my left… only to be deafened when a gunshot rang out to my right… The round barely missed me as it hit the doorway of the bathroom just in front of me, the snap and wood shavings from it showering the area as I ducked down and gripped my ear, aiming my boomstick, it was Isaac… who immediately waved his hands.

“Ah hell!! Sorry!!!”. “Isaac what the fuck?!” I exclaimed, though I could also barely hear him as he walked over and shouted. I nursed my ear as he asked “Hello!? You hearing me?!”.

“No, you deafened me!! The hell did you say?!” I asked, his answer sent a chill up my spine: “Look I had already seen you just before the house started to scream at us, and you nearly bit my fuckin’ head off!!”. Seen me? I stood up as I scanned around “Isaac what the hell are you talking about?”.

“I woke up just before the alarms started to go off, you were creeping over my bed and I was getting a bad vibe… then you tried to leap on me, and I grabbed this and started to fire into you-” he said showing the Glock 19 I had given him as a bedside carry. This was odd because that was sure to have woken me up. I looked to him, my ears still pounding “Well… where did… I go?” I asked. A crash from downstairs caused both of us to turn and aim at the stairwell down,, Zeus had crept into the hall and began to growl at it. I reached over and pulled him by his collar “Isaac… into the safe room, now”.

All three of us got into that armory as Isaac locked the door, I took to the desk connected to the security system as Isaac went to work preparing himself some firepower. “What the hell is going on?!” he asked and frankly I was asking the same thing. I pulled up the grid to my property… out of the several dozen motion detectors and trail cams I had set up, over 60% of them were offline, the rest were in states of damage, flickering, and only a few worked… one of which was one adjacent to my driveway. A single pinprick eye looked through the tall glass, then before I could even register it… a flash of silver, blackened nails on a bloated dead hand pried the camera’s steel and concrete embedded post out of the ground and smashed the unit.

That skin… that hand.

I switched between the cameras, so many of them were out of commission. Some were smashed and nearly tore off their mounts, others just flashed LED colors with fragments of their vision still intact. The driveway ones were already taken out, the one on the front of the house was completely offline, something had already invaded the property and taken out our eyes… not only that, but it knew where to look. I saw the notification for sound being registered, I got some crackles, static, like I expected… but then, cackles… deep, warped cackles of what sounded like a dozen people forced into one.

I had… stopped this, I thought I did.

Then, just as I did one more run back through all of the cameras… unit 21, mounted near the peak of the back of the house, highest up… registered a voice. It came through calm, almost a whisper, but like some sort of predator that caught it’s prey it called out: “Nolan….”. A sudden thrash as something monstrous running across the roof shook the whole damn house, caused me to almost lose balance as I held onto the house.

“What-in-the-bayou-fuck is going on?!” Isaac said, looking over my shoulder. I looked back to see he had gotten himself 2 bandoliers of shotgun shells, including a belt… while in his tank top and shorts. Zeus was barking, as the sound of something crawling around the outside caught his attention. Then… the movement on the roof stopped, towards the center; wet tearing and ripping, flesh and tendons, I know that sound anywhere, echoed… as thuds sounded on the roof. I switched off the cameras and made for my equipment table, prepping my rifle as I pulled my belt and plate carrier on.

“Is that shit sounding like what I think it’s sounding?” Isaac asked, aiming his shotgun around at whatever the hell was deciding to demonically touch every ceiling tile out there. He was feeling the familiar feeling too, this rhymed all too closely to whatever the hell was at the Cazamoth estate. “Those intelligence leaks” I pointed out, “You think they found us as well?” he asked.

“I think something found us…”; I tried to key into my radio; \[“Main this is November-1…”\].

Nothing, I tried again: \[“November-1 to Main, serious situation, I need support….”\]. Still nothing, dead silent, I looked back to him “Either our comms are cut, or our friends are preoccupied”.

Front outside towards the front, a thunderous roar sounded followed by what I knew damn sure was my front door being forced off his hinges and the snap of my bannister soon after. Isaac snapped towards the door with his shotgun as I pulled down my night vision, my rifle’s laser trained on the door as well. “So? What’s the plan? Sit tight and wait for help?” Isaac asked.

“Help ain’t coming Isaac, and by the time we even get a word out for help these things will be right ontop of us” I said, the sounds growing louder. The barrel of his shotgun dipped every slightly “So… what do we do?”.

Simple: “-We get the hell off my lawn”.

Zeus began to bark as a set of footsteps raced up the stairs and towards the door could be heard, the sound of a woman’s full lung scream growing louder. It began to slam on the door again, and again, finally it gave way and she stumbled in. In some tattered gown barely covering her dead skin soaked in what looked like tar. Her arms were bisected longways as she clawed at the floor more insect than human, through her long hair she looked to us, her face peeking through as whatever was coating her at through it… I don’t even know how she was even screaming, just a gap in her skull where her face was. She roared again; “Ah Jesus hell!!!!” Isaac yelled as he blasted her in the chest with his shotgun. The scatter blast tore through her hip and momentarily stopped her, however she used her multiple limbs to launch right at us…

I responded with a group of shots, tearing through her torso, she fell onto the large wooden ready table I had in the center sending ammo cans of rounds tumbling off, and tools flying. Zeus barked snapping his jaws at her from the ground, she stood up and Isaac got one hell of a good shot at her shoulder.

She went flying back against the wall, Zeus grabbing onto her leg and beginning to kill shake it out of her socket. I joined and fired several rounds, the snap of my suppressor echoing as they impacted her brainstem. That corrosive shit splattered all along the wall as she grew still. Zeus seemed to back off, he could tell from the smell that none of that was good. A moment of still occurred and I closed the distance, I used the tip of my suppressor to move her head to the side as that shit fell onto the floor. I watched it impact the floorboards… the black ichor seemed to… move. My mind thought back to the plastic baggie of shit I had encountered, between the coloration, the eyes, the laughs… the substance.

“This is from the Cazamoth Estate-” I stated my theory as I knelt down next to the corpse. “Ain’t no way though, I read your entire memoir on that, you killed those freaks” Isaac said, scanning around with his Mossberg not wanting to even think of the theory. “-Then tell me, Isaac, what the hell are they filled with the exact same shit from south Missouri?” I barked back. Our debate was cut short as a rumbling could be heard, inside of the walls. We could hear every single shuffle, and pained movement as it closed in on the vent… it fuckin’ popped off, a set of bloated dead arms, skin that cut itself on the metal edges and spewed puss, reached through as they aggressively tried to force themselves through. Two slimy heads, eyes sunken in dark rings, pin prick eyes and brown toothy smiles were attempting to force themselves through, to the point the wall around the vent opening contorted and bent. “Isaac!!! Nolan!!! Isaac!!! Nolan!!!” their voices sung with each other as they screamed. There was something about their aggression, their hatred I could feel through their forced smiles that was just shocking, making you feel like prey. I didn’t say a word, I fired my rifle, tearing through their skin, Isaac let loose with his shotgun.

The resulting blast of buckshot tore through the vent, showering the trio in pellets and broken metal, as the floor and wall around was torn up, all that remained was a pile of mess that was once human. I turned towards him “Still skeptical now?”. Isaac steadied himself the best he could, his stock in his armpit as he sheepishly dug… oh for fucksakes, he dug a flask out of his shorts and tool a long sip; “Nah, I’m right here with you”.

“For fucksakes, Isaac…” I shook my head, he looked “What?! They’re invading, I’m standing our ground!!!”.

“I didn’t say redecorate my entire fuckin’ house with double ought buck while you’re plaster out your-” our argument was cut short as the sounds of more of them from the stairwell could be heard. “How about this: We clear this place of ghouls, and I’ll fund the reconstruction” Isaac quipped. With what money, Isaac? you sleep on my couch… or well, figuratively, or he’d be down there getting possessed and quartered by the neighborhood brigade right now. “We beat them before, we can do it again, let’s go” I asserted to him, he nodded and followed.

My laser scanned as we pushed into the hallway, Isaac cleared right as I pushed forward towards the stairs, he joined me as Zeus was at our feet sniffing ahead. I was on the left side of the hall, my laser aimed down the stairs, I could see the remnants of the door hinges torn clean off… they were rated for 3,500lbs of incoming force, whatever came through here did so with a vengeance.

We pushed down the stairs, my barrel leading the way and centered on the wide open front door as Isaac watched our flank. As I reached the ground floor, I shuffled right and pied around the opening, I could hear them running throughout the tall grass, laughing, whispering, eyes peeking out and then ducking back with speeds too quick for their hulking forms. all peeking through as they could see me better than my dual tubes could. Then from the tall grass, one of them bolted out. “Incoming!!!” I yelled, heading over to the doorway I fired as the gray mass closed the distance across my front area onto the porch. I fired rounds that cut through it’s back, lodged right in it’s body, black splashes filled the are and yet it still kept it’s momentum.

“Move!!-”.

That’s all I could get out as Isaac ducked right, Zeus barked as the thing charged and knocked me clean off my ass through the air and into my couch. It didn’t seem to care how many rounds I fired into it, I rolled off and groggily got a good lock. Its still human torso was the cross roads for a horrifying monstrosity where dog-like legs met an army that was that of a centipede, but the chitin was made out of calcified black flesh. The other one was seemingly made of glass and had gaps between bones, the head was fighting between several different mouths, gray and sunken into it’s torso… it’s sunken pin prick eyes centered on me

Whatever the hell happened to it, it decided to turn their soul into some sort of skin split thing. It’s voice was that of dozens, roars, yells, and yet it semi coherently all said: “Nolan”.

I tried to back up as it reached down, the centipede arm gnawing at my plate carrier, tearing through the nylon cordura as I fired into it’s torso sending chunks of flesh and bone flying out the back. Zeus lept on top zinking his teeth into it’s neck causing it to yell what sounded like a cross between a tiger and a ma. Isaac planted his shotgun right on the skull, the shot caused the entire thing to explode out which completely showered me… and I didn’t know what was worse: being covered in dead person or dead rotten beast.

I forced my buttstock into the ground, my head still rolling around as Isaac took point and looked to me: “How you feeling? You got knocked a country mile”.

I felt the base of my neck that still felt like it was on fire: “Been worse, landed right on my neck. “Quick, how many fingers am I holding up?”. “Isaac you’re not holding up any”. “See? You’re good”.

From the doorway to the kitchen, a set of elongated arms connected to a body that was stretched and contorted beyond human proportions. It stepped in bow legged, its face… a human skull that had been buried and pushed into the collar bone area sat below a smooth, angler fish like top portion. Two sets of jaws forced together, formed some horrifying maw that just hurt to look at,  like knives being dragged down my bare bones. We quickly fired on it, it grabbed onto the ground around it and spat at us… that same tar like shit, Isaac was quicker that I was. Some of it hit directly on the plate carrier, eating into my ATAK. The smell was… awful, it began to fuck with me, I didn’t know it until well into it’s effects but soon I realized I was hallucinating.

My eyes burned, my nose doing everything it could to exorcize the feeling to no avail, the pounding noise in my head felt like screams and chants. It felt real, every gust of wind, everything was hypersensitive. I scanned around, the ground unsteady, then it lunged at me. I could feel it’s claws slashing into my skin, I screamed and fired at it although it just degloved my arms like it was nothing, I could see the veins and blood underneath as it threw me into a wall and it gave in. I stood up and I was back… upstairs? The thing came charging down and I managed to clip the human skull underneath, causing it to stumble. As it did I fired, the flash of my suppressor under nods short, small, yet controlled as I tore through one of it’s legs.

It then reached out and hooked my jaw…. Then pulled and yanked it clean off. The feeling of my tongue flapping around, my gasps for air… I dropped my rifle to it’s sking as it slashed at my face. I fell to the ground, back in the living room… Zeus was now gnawing at it’s head as it reached for him.

Not. My. Fuckin. Dog. I fired an entire magazine into it, having switched to auto it tore through it’s center off mass. I then charged forward and tackled it to the ground, the armored knuckles on my gloves being buried into it’s head. It’s elongated arms tried to reach and tear through my plates, I didn’t care, hell I took off my helmet and began to pound it over, and over, with the clear side of my kevlar. The burning feeling it had on my corneas combined with a chorus of screams that just wouldn’t end, I would make it end. It’s head snapped back as it began to be crushed, soon the vortex-like swirls that formed it’s eyes began to snap back… looking human, and looked… like me.

Isaac threw me to the ground, I gasped as I could feel the clear air again, my vision normal as the property, the house… everything was silent. Zeus was sat in the center carpet… surrounded by dozens of malformed, transformed adversaries that were now spending their last seconds on this earth bleeding out. I sat up, catching my breath. I looked around… the beast with the elongated arms was laying on the floor, it’s head completely pulverized… my helmet embedded into it. I looked to Isaac, I’ll be honest I was shaken the fuck up “W-What the fuck…”.

“Yeah you lost your shit… a bunch of them began to pour in, you were firing wildly, you started tearing them apart…” he said, I raised an eyebrow, I didn’t remember that and I still don’t but I looked around. There was a hole in my wall wide open into my kitchen… some sort of hound like beast, skeletal with blood and muscle being it’s only exterior had it’s throat ripped out and my multitool stuck in its skull. My rifle was on the ground, bolt locked to the rear amongst several others.

“I don’t hear anything else…” I said, staggering to my feet. “Yeah, I think we might’ve gotten them all…” Isaac said, he paused for a moment, looking around “Okay, no jinxing us this time, I think they’re actually all dead… or escaped”. I quickly cleared and replenished my rifle, Isaac and I secured the kitchen and basement, right around when we got primary power back on… my radio crackled to life.

\[“November-1, sitrep…”\] it was Montgomery’s voice. I looked to Isaac before hitting the push-to-talk; \[“This is November-1, just experienced an attack on my residence, it got kinetic… we’re still alive but in a bad way… how copy?”\].

A few seconds of static, some failed key-in attempts… Montgomery answered \[“Roger that… we’ve got an organization wide attack… stay put and prepare the best you can”\]. Isaac scoffed, rolling his eyes he kicked the mangled remains of something that was formerly intruding, now decomposing “yeah, tell manchester it’s a little late for that”.

\[“November-1 to Main, I’ve got several dozen EKIA, I need reinforcements-”\].

What he said next planted a deep pit in my stomach: \[“Dozens of PEXU solo units have not reported back in, November-1. We’re barely able to take accountability. Hunker down the best you can and we will be coming for you… Main-Out”\]. There Isaac and I stood in my house, I sighed as he slung his shotgun, looking around “Well…. Nail and boards?”.

I pinched the bridge of my nose; “What are we going to just board up all the holes and sit next to the radio?”. We did, it took around 25 minutes however Isaac and I successfully and haphazardly re-secured the house. Occasionally we would hear the sound of something outside, neither of us went to look however we did keep our weapons ready, nothing would attack again. In the morning the sound of an SUV approaching after the sun rose above the horizon cautioned all three of us to approach, my suppressor and his barrel sticking out gaps in the boards.

The blacked out vic parked in my driveway, the door opened and a young man in a navy suit, slicked back hair exited. He kept his hands up, only moving one to take his sunglasses off…. Montgomery chuckled at the state of things before he looked at the structure: “I’ll take it, you’ve had a very entertaining night, November-1?”.

I drew my barrel back from the opening and peeked through “You can say that… how’s everyone else doing?”. The smirk on his face faded as he sighed, approaching “SMUs survived intact, many weren’t touched for obvious reasons… others like yourself, intelligence personnel… well, let’s just say we’ve got less comrades than when the night started”. That’s where we are at right now; Isaac and I are still holding down the fort, surprisingly we’ve gotten the actual structure resecured but let’s just say it won’t be pretty for some time. I don’t plan on leaving anytime soon… this place is my home, I hid here when I wanted to step away, and I don’t plan on running off again. PEXU has taken a considerable amount of casualties, though we’ve sustained it… it’s time for us to hunker down, lick our wounds, and soon we will be counter attacking. Don’t think it’s over, it’s not, just a little bit shot to hell right now… we’ll get back to it.

We’ll take it to them, their home, their blood… Montgomery has also said PEXU is interested in looking into whatever Theodor Cazamoth has been doing… because that black ichor we found on many of those bastards that tried to gut Isaac, Zeus, and I? They match samples recovered from a facility found on the east coast, one that 4th Special Forces Group touched down at a few years ago…. The same substance I encountered while I was defending Cazamoth’s estate.

It’s not over, we’ll be back.

1hylkda,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooseBumps/comments/1hylkda/say_cheese_and_die_is_totally_overrated/,Say cheese and die is totally overrated,"So first thing I was a huge fan of goosebumps as a kid. I decided to read them again and while being a little disappointed at how they're not really ennjoyable as an adult I still like how perfect they were for 9 years old me, and while of course not being really deep, I find a lot of plot to have sense in their simplicity
So, say cheese and die. I remember hunting for this book as a child as it had maybe the coolest and scaries cover ever, and remember also that reading it wasn't as good.
I read it again and man, I found it to be so non sense even for a children book! I hated all the characters (My god Bird I would have taken so many picture of you until I see one in which you are a skeleton) but the thing that I hated the most is that the story is totally dumb driven. We have a good idea, a camera that causes bad things to happen (I like how people still ask if it predict or cause, yeah I am sure that that little kid was destined to disappear suddenly and reappear from the void). But the camera is... Not really that evil by herself! It doesn't take pictures on herself and it doesn't really haunt the kids, who could simply not use it. Ok with the first photo, who could have guessed. Ok with the second one it makes sense to test it. Not really ok with the third, ok you want to test it but man, why you point that at your brother after you saw the picture of your new car destroyed? After that you decide to take it with you at your friend's match. And from here things get totally non sense: shari threaten you to make you eat the camera if you photograph her and she's still not sure if it's wicked. After that your friend almost died in front of you and your friend's father went to the hospital because of the camera. And what you do next, after having the confirmation that the camera is really evil? You start crying about bringing the evil camera to your party so that you can make photos! And what that incel greg does while still mourning for causing his father almost death? He brings the camera and shoot photos of his friend!

The only possible danger was actually the possibly evil man hunting him, but fact is that he wanted to take back something that he wanted to give him back (they could ideally have had a cup of coffee together to sign the deal), 
They could have shown greg trying to destroy the camera and not succeding, and make the camera able to autoclick to justify the insane number of photos that were taken in the book. No, we're stupid and bored kids let's bring the evil camera to a party and see if someone dies. I'm going to pass over other things which are stupid but are typical of the books and acceptable for kids stories. But I can see that there's a big difference between a fucking living dummy that wants to kill you, a haunted house with ghosts, a green goo that keep on grow and you don't know how to stop, and a fucking camera that you know is evil, you're scared of, don't have any psychological interest or attraction towards it, caused your father almost to die, but for some reason you can't stop using it cause you're a spineless little incel who loves a girl who's attracted to your older brother.

Ok someone dies in the end, and that's cool. But I literally think that this book required an even younger age than my (at the time of first read) 9 years.",0,1736561618.0,GooseBumps,5,0.5,False

1hylk5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1hylk5u/musttry_spa_treatments_for_relaxation_and/,Must-Try Spa Treatments for Relaxation and Rejuvenation,"Taking time for yourself to relax and rejuvenate is essential in today’s fast-paced world. Spa treatments offer the perfect escape from the stresses of daily life, allowing you to refresh your body, mind, and spirit. Whether you're a seasoned spa enthusiast or considering your first treatment, exploring different options can elevate your self-care routine. Here are some must-try spa treatments to enhance your relaxation journey.

# 1. Swedish Massage

Swedish massage is one of the most popular and widely practiced types of massage therapy. This treatment focuses on relaxing the entire body using gentle, long strokes, kneading, and circular movements on the top layers of muscles. It’s ideal for relieving stress and tension, improving circulation, and promoting overall relaxation. If you're new to massage therapy, Swedish massage is a perfect starting point.

# 2. Deep Tissue Massage

For those seeking relief from chronic pain or tight muscles, a deep tissue massage is a must. This technique applies firm pressure to the deeper layers of muscle and connective tissue, targeting specific areas of tension. It’s particularly beneficial for athletes, individuals recovering from injuries, or anyone experiencing persistent stiffness. While it may feel intense at times, the long-term benefits are well worth it.

# 3. Hot Stone Therapy

Hot stone therapy combines the benefits of massage with the soothing power of heat. Smooth, heated stones are placed on key points of the body to relax tense muscles and improve energy flow. The warmth of the stones not only enhances relaxation but also helps relieve pain and improve circulation. This treatment is perfect for unwinding after a long week or indulging in some much-needed pampering.

# 4. Aromatherapy Massage

Incorporating essential oils into a massage session can significantly enhance the experience. Aromatherapy massage uses the healing properties of oils such as lavender, eucalyptus, or chamomile to promote relaxation, reduce stress, and uplift your mood. This treatment stimulates both your body and senses, making it an excellent choice for holistic rejuvenation.

# 5. Body Scrubs and Wraps

Exfoliation is a vital step in maintaining healthy, glowing skin, and body scrubs do just that. Made with ingredients like sugar, salt, or coffee grounds, scrubs gently remove dead skin cells and improve circulation. Following the scrub, body wraps infused with hydrating or detoxifying ingredients can nourish your skin and leave you feeling refreshed from head to toe.

# 6. Facial Treatments

Your face deserves just as much attention as the rest of your body. Facials tailored to your skin type can cleanse, exfoliate, and hydrate, leaving your complexion radiant and rejuvenated. Many facials include soothing massages for the face and scalp, ensuring total relaxation.

# 7. Reflexology

Reflexology is a unique treatment that involves applying pressure to specific points on the feet, hands, or ears. These points are believed to correspond to various organs and systems in the body, promoting overall wellness and balance. Reflexology can alleviate stress, improve circulation, and boost your energy levels.

# 8. Hydrotherapy

Water-based treatments like hydrotherapy baths or Vichy showers are an excellent way to relax and detoxify. Warm water helps ease muscle tension and improve circulation, while therapeutic jets gently massage your body. Hydrotherapy is both calming and invigorating, making it a favorite among spa enthusiasts.

# 9. Couples’ Spa Treatments

Sharing a spa experience with a partner or friend can deepen your bond while you both unwind. Couples’ treatments, such as massages or side-by-side facials, allow you to relax together in a serene environment. It’s a perfect way to celebrate a special occasion or simply spend quality time with a loved one.

# 10. Thai Massage

Thai massage is a more active form of therapy that involves stretching and acupressure techniques. Often described as “yoga massage,” this treatment enhances flexibility, relieves tension, and boosts energy levels. Thai massage is ideal for those seeking a dynamic and revitalizing experience.

Incorporating these treatments into your wellness routine can transform your approach to self-care, leaving you feeling renewed and invigorated. Whether you’re looking to unwind, relieve pain, or enhance your overall well-being, there’s a spa treatment perfectly suited to your needs.

1hylk2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1hylk2g/an_occult_hunters_deathlog_part_7/,An Occult Hunter's Deathlog [Part 7],"Alright, we’re back. Well, not fully. Sort of-....

I’ll explain.

It’s been a minute since the end of our mission to the Navajo Nation. Truth be told, opening the car door to my driveway has never felt more tranquil… That was until I heard the passenger door swing open and I could hear every single vertebrae in Isaac’s back realign as he stretched. “Ah, home-sweet-ranch-compound, huh Dwight?”. Yes for the foreseeable future, noting our long absence from each other and his seeming inability to recall the last better part of a decade, I’ve elected Isaac can shack up at my place. Zeus has seemingly taking a liking to him, although truth be told that 90lb canine assault missile will take to just about anyone that will feed him.

Sorry back on track, we were looking at several weeks of downtime, which despite the fact that I should have been focused on recuperation… I could only think of piecing together what’s been happening. It’s a flaw of mine, once I’m hooked I have to see something through to the end… I guess that’s why I’m the maniac who didn’t run from the Cazamoth Estate and went to Afghanistan four separate times. Regardless we had some noncombat objective… or so it seemed.

“Hey Dwight, you like decorating your house with hand prints?” Isaac quipped, my mind immediately thought back to the print indent I saw on the gutter and porch post. “Yeah, don’t mind them, I’ll… it’s a thing” I said as I dragged my gear bag out of my trunk. Then something he said made the hair on the back of my neck stand up: “... All of them?”. What did he mean “all” of them? Well, I found out what he meant when I turned and… on the wooden railing, the steps, doorway, at multiple points on the glass were more hand prints. Coating the front of the house… I’d been gone for a few weeks, but this was new, this hadn’t happened before. I dropped my gear on the porch and looked at some of them, they were embedded just a few millimeters into the wood, the glass, even the stone… just enough to be noticeable. All of them were human like, four fingers and a thumb, but… I don’t know. They were cave painting is, archaic, weird… enigmatic.

Just like the traps that were warped and bent impossibly. Just like the hundred dead birds that passed inexplicably. … This was another probe.

The only thing greeting us besides the wind and Zeus’ sniffing and growling at some of the prints was the silence, all eyes were on us… That was until Isaac broke the air with an all too giddy: “Do you have a craving for property that’s got demonic intent or is this all just happenstance?”. Guess I’m just lucky.

Truth be told, getting used to Isaac again wasn’t too much of a challenge, to be honest between him and Zeus, having people around this place again was much better than absolute solitude. Though we had our fair share of weird moments, Zeus seems to be sticking to the area immediately around the house when he trots outside, there’s an eerie feeling I’ve been getting everytime I take my ATV out and scout the lands. Isaac’s been telling me the “walls are talking”, though that may just be the alcohol. Like, a serious amount of alcohol, we’re out in an isolated part near the rockies, where does he get that much- nevermind, rambling again, just like old times. The knocking… did I tell you guys about the knocking? Well, there’s knocking everytime I go to get the coffee. Sometimes its at a window, a wall, other times from the door, one day Isaac went to go confront it but I just told him: “Don’t answer it”.

There’s some things in this world you just don’t mess with, and I’ve got some hella’ spiritual blood on my hands. It will always probably be “weird” for the rest of my life, but I guess that’s just the parameters… the hand I’ve been dealt. Things were starting to get worse though… coyotes started to show up dead. Now it’s not unusual for Zeus to embrace his canine apex predator instincts and chase them down, then drag them back to the house to enjoy his kill right where everyone including the mailman could see it. What was unusual was for a whole pack of them to be left right at the bottom of the front steps, gutted brutally to where they were all peeled and ripped open, their blood and innards painting the front of the damn house.

I remember nearly stepping in when we went to go check, door slowly opened as I kept my glock to my right, Isaac had elected to creep out a shotgun and scan the front. “Okay, yeah, this place is definitely screwed, you ever think about relocating?” he remarked. Even if I wanted to, I don’t think this is something you can run from… I remember Zeus sniffing at the pile, only to back off and growl at it with his ears back refusing to eat any of it. We went to my office on the second floor where I had the entire property’s motion sensors, cameras, and surveillance set up… it happened last night, although no motion sensors triggered it. We found the point of appearance and… well.

2:17am; the porch is clear and everything is fine, night vision on my cameras gives us damn near a 360 view of the property and every inch of it from where the pavement turns to gravel, and then to grass. Then… it all appeared instantaneously: the dead coyotes, the blood to the point where some of the lenses were even smeared, all of it. Isaac and I zoomed in on the exact millisecond, opening maybe there was some cut off or something to show what happened…. Nothing. .01: it’s not there, .02, all of it. Whatever did this, didn’t do it through conventional means.

“What do you think it could mean?” Isaac asked, flipping through all of the cameras showing every angle of the carnage. I’ll tell you what I told him… something was sending a message, in the same way bodies are strung up at the front of bridges to ward off enemies this was the same thing. Isaac had a different theory, he pointed to an image of the pile: “The blood is one thing, but the bodies? They seem to be in the form of an… offering”.

I was dumbfounded and my face probably showed my confusion: “What?”. My Idaho alcoholic went on to explain: “Think about it… This is a crossroads, right, you got the Dakotas to our northish, west is red rock territory, south is Texas and Oklahoma, this is a merging area of all kinds of nasty shit, that’s why so many different things happen… We’ve seen uglies leave carcasses and stuff out as a warning, this… the way they’re like, placed all together like a meat wicker basket. Seems like they were presenting it to you. Gotta remember, things don’t work like people do”. If this is the way things worked, then it could happen on the opposite: just as something could show you respect, something else could target you.

We kept moving though; carcasses went in the trash and I took a power washer to the front of the house, and after some replacing of tiles, wood, the majority of the handprints were gone. I was tired of running and I wasn’t about to let anything scare or force me off this land, well, force “us” now I guess as this isn’t a one man circus anymore.

Likewise there’s been developments on the grander scale, more specifically the shadow war PEXU is embroiled in against our adversaries. You ever wonder who leads the Blackwood Brotherhood? It’s a question that’s been raised by many, while the New Advent has Ryan Evans we all know that man’s nothing more than a gray skinned puppet with darkness behind his wide toothy smile. After he appeared at that meeting where he addressed the world flanked by politicians from north and South America, Europe, leading figures in economics and big tech… an investigation was launched by the CIA’s Special Collection Service to track when this huge shift in momentum for them happened. They sorted through tens of thousands of emails, phone calls, texts, and found almost nothing relating to the New Advent at all.

Then… a singular message shared on an encrypted messaging app by some lower level informant shells connected to our adversaries sent everyone into a panic. “Belial”; in Hebrew it means the Devil, in the context they found it in it reignited a manhunt that had gone cold nearly 32 years ago. Believed to be the victim of a death camp in the middle east, he was being tracked by Israeli intelligence for quite some time after a special mission unit they sent to capture him all turned up dead. No wound, blemishes, nothing, just cold and unalive. After that he fell off the grid and ever since they it’s been nothing but theories connecting him to the primordial death cult we currently face: cells found in Denmark, Great Britain talked about an Augur from Damascus instructing them to revive the PARAFOR leading to shit we are still fighting to this day. Every connection from groups or training groups we get stops, no names, no ranks… just the tale of a man with dark red skin, sunken eyes and a bright white smile. His lips supposedly gone from acid burns that also line his body. Yet… it was all conjecture, drawings in scribbles of mad men who died when they allowed ancient shit to crawl out of their bodies like molted animals.

Until one single message: *“Belial will lead the way”.*

Then it all hit the fan: two operatives PEXU had with us, one from the agency and the other homeland security were found dead outside of a site that doesn’t exist on any manifest in the United States internal security directorate. No documentation exists because all of it’s funding is from black budget. The recovery teams assigned to retrieve them became casualties themselves as whoever left them there carved glyphs into their eyes… the same one the Blackwood uses for indoctrination. Shortly after? Deep in the Amazon ABIN, Brazil’s premiere intelligence network, was searching for a facility hidden in the rainforest connected to the cult. Attached to them were some members of the Special Activities Division… almost all of them didn’t make it out alive, half of them were grievously injured. A completely compartmentalized operation was compromised and ambushed… worst yet was the place they were hunting for disappeared. Every piece of metal, everything from the satellite photos was gone, like it never existed.

2 steps forward, 3 back into the woodchipper.

I won’t lie, my security office has turned into that of a makeshift war room with pelican cases and tough boxes lining the walls, a rack securing my armament, and a cork board of all I’ve learned complete with red string. The noose was tightening around our neck, 2 intelligence agencies experiencing major breaches, vew few within he FBI can be trusted and even MI6 needs to work in the shadows. Everyone from megachurches to corner stores is starting to wear those golden bands, and no one seems to be noticing. Not a peep or a whisper, anyone who does goes missing… 110,000\~ a year and counting, if even a tenth of that has been turned into vessels for ascension then we are neck deep in enemies. Honestly staring too deeply into it all laid out like that makes me nearly go mad sometimes, sitting back in an armory knowing that just weeks ago we fought through hell just to get ourselves an inch of breathing room.

“Oh lord, don’t tell me, you’re going insane aren’t you?” Isaac’s voice managed to draw me out of it with an eye roll as he walked in and took an eye at the board: “Hey Dwight, if you are succumbing to whatever MKUltra stuff they pumped into your veins, give me a heads up so I can get out of the blast zone alright?”. We seemed to stare at each other for a good long while as he took a step closer to he, chuckling “Ah! I’m just messing with yah, but for real, did they… put anything in your coffee? I mean you never drank coffee last time I’d seen you so I’m wondering if you’re the real Dwight…-”.

Isaac somehow manages to say so much and yet nothing at the same time. He leaned back against the wall next to it, crossing his arms “So, what now?”. I shrugged, I leaned back and grabbed my coffee that was sitting atop a palette of ammo cans “We wait until we hear more”.

“Oh come on! There’s gotta be something we can do, call up that Hogwarts fellow of your, Montana-”.

“Montgomery” I corrected him.

“Yeah sure, we can still do something, get back out there, hop in our supe-d up mystery machine and take it to ‘em!” he said emphatically, pumping his fist in the air. A supe-d up mystery that had the transmission blown to hell ever since I had to floor it over a sasquatch back in the Dakotas… more on that later.

“Isaac, we’re part of an organization… well, me, but-”. “I am too?!” Isaac said, I pinched the bridge of my nose realizing my mistake. “No, I am, you are unofficially by association”. “Still, how’s the pay?”. “Terrible”. “The benefits?”. “Worse”. “So what’s the incentive?” he asked, raising an eyebrow.  
“Duty”. “Oh god you guys really are insane”.

You think? Mortals using the modern day’s best armaments to cut through the hordes of wherever-the-hell to send whatever-the-hell back to where it was summoned from by other mortals. I’ve seen more of our people succumb to injuries that can’t be determined by our laws of universe than slashes and guttings, yet I still clock in. There’s definitely something wrong with me.

“I guess that gives us some time to think… or well, remember” Isaac said, rubbing his head. It was no secret his lack of memory was weighing on him, he does a good job putting up a front. “You’ve had no contact with anyone? Haven’t been back there in?…” I asked, his eyes snapped to me “Too long…”. We had ourselves, the cult, but then there was Theodore Cazamoth, my old boss who was obsessed with seeing how he could industrialize the primordial to advance humanity. “Advancement” that 4th Special Forces Group encountered on more than one occasion and lost more than a few of their own. We had been so dug in fighting a subversive apocalypse, what the hell was Theodore able to do the last 6 years?

We were going to have to find out… later. “I’m hitting the hay, let me know if some demon tries to tear our hearts out in the middle of the night, yeah?” Isaac said heading for the door. “Wilco, if you get the chance before me, dump my body down a flight of stairs” I joked. Isaac stopped at the door as he looked around, then back to me “Hey Dwight”.

“Yeah?”. “I’m glad you’re back”. The sincerity in his words seemed to sober me up, the same feeling that drew me back to this years ago… that’s why I keep marching on. Not insanity or money, duty… someone had to make the shit in the dark afraid, someone had to go in there and get vengeance for the grieving spouse, the crying child, the mourning parent, or those who went alone with no one to remember their name. I did… every single person I have gotten some pound of justice for.

I woke up later around witching hour to grab a water. Zeus stayed in bed as I headed downstairs with iron in my pocket just in case someone wanted to try. I rounded the bannister as I reached the bottom of my stairs, my front door just ahead of them as the entire living room was laid out with a couch, chimney, table and all… I stopped as my eyes snapped to the chair in the corner. I drew my pistol and tried to hit the light, nothing… my finger felt the rail underneath where it should have been. A light then shined on me causing me to squint my eyes, it aimed down as my eyes adjusted… it was my taclight.

“You rely on your equipment too much, Dwight Nolan” the figure sitting in the chair said, that of an impoverished male’s voice. The moonlight just barely missed them as shadows cloaked them, they tossed the taclight to me causing it to bounce across the floor. With my pistol still aimed I reached down and placed it back on and got a good lock at them. In a dark suit and dress shoes was a bald man, gray skin with dozens of stitches of different sutures lined their head. A black set of shades hid their eyes as on their lap they held what looked to be a chalkboard.

*“Dwight Anthony Nolan. 39 years old. Son, Leader, Killer…”.*

Tally marks were underneath, hundreds of tally marks… each one of them dark red, whispering to me. I knew what they meant… a name, an age, a birth and death date. Some were the things I had been ordered to cut down, target packages filled in the dozens… over a hundred. I looked to them, then back to the man; “Who the fuck are you?”.

“A watcher, numbers keeper mostly”. “You got some sort of point in doing this? I’ve got half a mind to-”.

“You’ve got a lot of blood on your hands” the stitched up freak said accusingly. “What? Sad I put down your friends? Or something in the woods, or the swamp, or across the ocean. I’m not gonna apologize” I growled, my finger well on the trigger as I started to apply force. “What about them?” it said staring blankly at me, pointing to another tally mark… Alyssa, Age 23, born in the Navajo Nation, died because we weren’t fast enough to reach her house to tell her to get to safety. It’s hand pointed to another… These weren’t just kills, these were people I had failed to save. Sometimes it was because I had a wrong lead, other times I was just too slow, some there was nothing I could do… but it was on my soul.

“Protectors have continued to form a membrane of annoyance for thousands of years, Dwight Nolan. We are closer than ever to shifting the momentum back to the era where you hid in the caves protected by a campfire and a stick” It said with glee in it’s voice. It was well aware of the pressure going on around the world, it knew that I knew as well… I didn’t give it an inch. “Well you won’t be there to see it” I said, pulling the trigger… the gun didn’t fire. I raised an eyebrow as suddenly I could hear pounding on the door that made my heart shoot straight into my throat.

“No, Dwight Nolan, you won’t. You didn’t really think hiding in the rockies would save you, would it?” my light went out… and I woke up in bed. That being said, I woke up to a chorus of alerts coming from the speaker on my night stand; \[“Multiple intrusions detected… multiple intrusions detected…. Condition Alamo, Condition Alamo, Condition, Alamo”\].

Something had followed us home.

Dossier: Condition Alamo Alamo… in every military there’s a contingency when deployed for whenever the wire is breached and the enemy has entered. The Poles I worked with liked to use the term Red, a Brit unit I worked with preferred Direct Fire Charlie. I’ve always stuck with one I’ve encountered at a number of American Fobs: Alamo.

Zeus was barking a storm as I could hear banging coming from the front door downstairs, for reference I bought a steel lined reinforced door with heavy duty hinges and several locks. That being said I had also gotten into scraps with things that cut through material tougher than it with no issues. I had minutes at most… I scrambled out of bed to find my pistol on my nightstand, drawing it and scanning around. Zeus was standing on the bed growling… the banging had stopped as I looked… no moonlight just like there had been hours ago.

I approached the curtains and peeked just under the edge to see, only to find an eye staring back. It was completely white, the iris gone with a pinprick needle for a pupil… my blood ran cold, I remember that kind of eye. I stumbled back and aimed my boomstick but only darkness remained. Then… laughter, dozens of different cackles, jeers, echoed from the outside… this wasn’t right, this… I had been here before, I had encountered something exactly like this… back when I was just a security guard hired to protect that fuckin’ forest estate.

Fuck this, we need to kit up quick. I opened the my door and shined my pistol light around, clear left and right, a few doors ahead of me were the bathroom and a study, directly to my right was the armory. I took a step out, watching the stairs down to my left… only to be deafened when a gunshot rang out to my right… The round barely missed me as it hit the doorway of the bathroom just in front of me, the snap and wood shavings from it showering the area as I ducked down and gripped my ear, aiming my boomstick, it was Isaac… who immediately waved his hands.

“Ah hell!! Sorry!!!”. “Isaac what the fuck?!” I exclaimed, though I could also barely hear him as he walked over and shouted. I nursed my ear as he asked “Hello!? You hearing me?!”.

“No, you deafened me!! The hell did you say?!” I asked, his answer sent a chill up my spine: “Look I had already seen you just before the house started to scream at us, and you nearly bit my fuckin’ head off!!”. Seen me? I stood up as I scanned around “Isaac what the hell are you talking about?”.

“I woke up just before the alarms started to go off, you were creeping over my bed and I was getting a bad vibe… then you tried to leap on me, and I grabbed this and started to fire into you-” he said showing the Glock 19 I had given him as a bedside carry. This was odd because that was sure to have woken me up. I looked to him, my ears still pounding “Well… where did… I go?” I asked. A crash from downstairs caused both of us to turn and aim at the stairwell down,, Zeus had crept into the hall and began to growl at it. I reached over and pulled him by his collar “Isaac… into the safe room, now”.

All three of us got into that armory as Isaac locked the door, I took to the desk connected to the security system as Isaac went to work preparing himself some firepower. “What the hell is going on?!” he asked and frankly I was asking the same thing. I pulled up the grid to my property… out of the several dozen motion detectors and trail cams I had set up, over 60% of them were offline, the rest were in states of damage, flickering, and only a few worked… one of which was one adjacent to my driveway. A single pinprick eye looked through the tall glass, then before I could even register it… a flash of silver, blackened nails on a bloated dead hand pried the camera’s steel and concrete embedded post out of the ground and smashed the unit.

That skin… that hand.

I switched between the cameras, so many of them were out of commission. Some were smashed and nearly tore off their mounts, others just flashed LED colors with fragments of their vision still intact. The driveway ones were already taken out, the one on the front of the house was completely offline, something had already invaded the property and taken out our eyes… not only that, but it knew where to look. I saw the notification for sound being registered, I got some crackles, static, like I expected… but then, cackles… deep, warped cackles of what sounded like a dozen people forced into one.

I had… stopped this, I thought I did.

Then, just as I did one more run back through all of the cameras… unit 21, mounted near the peak of the back of the house, highest up… registered a voice. It came through calm, almost a whisper, but like some sort of predator that caught it’s prey it called out: “Nolan….”. A sudden thrash as something monstrous running across the roof shook the whole damn house, caused me to almost lose balance as I held onto the house.

“What-in-the-bayou-fuck is going on?!” Isaac said, looking over my shoulder. I looked back to see he had gotten himself 2 bandoliers of shotgun shells, including a belt… while in his tank top and shorts. Zeus was barking, as the sound of something crawling around the outside caught his attention. Then… the movement on the roof stopped, towards the center; wet tearing and ripping, flesh and tendons, I know that sound anywhere, echoed… as thuds sounded on the roof. I switched off the cameras and made for my equipment table, prepping my rifle as I pulled my belt and plate carrier on.

“Is that shit sounding like what I think it’s sounding?” Isaac asked, aiming his shotgun around at whatever the hell was deciding to demonically touch every ceiling tile out there. He was feeling the familiar feeling too, this rhymed all too closely to whatever the hell was at the Cazamoth estate. “Those intelligence leaks” I pointed out, “You think they found us as well?” he asked.

“I think something found us…”; I tried to key into my radio; \[“Main this is November-1…”\].

Nothing, I tried again: \[“November-1 to Main, serious situation, I need support….”\]. Still nothing, dead silent, I looked back to him “Either our comms are cut, or our friends are preoccupied”.

Front outside towards the front, a thunderous roar sounded followed by what I knew damn sure was my front door being forced off his hinges and the snap of my bannister soon after. Isaac snapped towards the door with his shotgun as I pulled down my night vision, my rifle’s laser trained on the door as well. “So? What’s the plan? Sit tight and wait for help?” Isaac asked.

“Help ain’t coming Isaac, and by the time we even get a word out for help these things will be right ontop of us” I said, the sounds growing louder. The barrel of his shotgun dipped every slightly “So… what do we do?”.

Simple: “-We get the hell off my lawn”.

Zeus began to bark as a set of footsteps raced up the stairs and towards the door could be heard, the sound of a woman’s full lung scream growing louder. It began to slam on the door again, and again, finally it gave way and she stumbled in. In some tattered gown barely covering her dead skin soaked in what looked like tar. Her arms were bisected longways as she clawed at the floor more insect than human, through her long hair she looked to us, her face peeking through as whatever was coating her at through it… I don’t even know how she was even screaming, just a gap in her skull where her face was. She roared again; “Ah Jesus hell!!!!” Isaac yelled as he blasted her in the chest with his shotgun. The scatter blast tore through her hip and momentarily stopped her, however she used her multiple limbs to launch right at us…

I responded with a group of shots, tearing through her torso, she fell onto the large wooden ready table I had in the center sending ammo cans of rounds tumbling off, and tools flying. Zeus barked snapping his jaws at her from the ground, she stood up and Isaac got one hell of a good shot at her shoulder.

She went flying back against the wall, Zeus grabbing onto her leg and beginning to kill shake it out of her socket. I joined and fired several rounds, the snap of my suppressor echoing as they impacted her brainstem. That corrosive shit splattered all along the wall as she grew still. Zeus seemed to back off, he could tell from the smell that none of that was good. A moment of still occurred and I closed the distance, I used the tip of my suppressor to move her head to the side as that shit fell onto the floor. I watched it impact the floorboards… the black ichor seemed to… move. My mind thought back to the plastic baggie of shit I had encountered, between the coloration, the eyes, the laughs… the substance.

“This is from the Cazamoth Estate-” I stated my theory as I knelt down next to the corpse. “Ain’t no way though, I read your entire memoir on that, you killed those freaks” Isaac said, scanning around with his Mossberg not wanting to even think of the theory. “-Then tell me, Isaac, what the hell are they filled with the exact same shit from south Missouri?” I barked back. Our debate was cut short as a rumbling could be heard, inside of the walls. We could hear every single shuffle, and pained movement as it closed in on the vent… it fuckin’ popped off, a set of bloated dead arms, skin that cut itself on the metal edges and spewed puss, reached through as they aggressively tried to force themselves through. Two slimy heads, eyes sunken in dark rings, pin prick eyes and brown toothy smiles were attempting to force themselves through, to the point the wall around the vent opening contorted and bent. “Isaac!!! Nolan!!! Isaac!!! Nolan!!!” their voices sung with each other as they screamed. There was something about their aggression, their hatred I could feel through their forced smiles that was just shocking, making you feel like prey. I didn’t say a word, I fired my rifle, tearing through their skin, Isaac let loose with his shotgun.

The resulting blast of buckshot tore through the vent, showering the trio in pellets and broken metal, as the floor and wall around was torn up, all that remained was a pile of mess that was once human. I turned towards him “Still skeptical now?”. Isaac steadied himself the best he could, his stock in his armpit as he sheepishly dug… oh for fucksakes, he dug a flask out of his shorts and tool a long sip; “Nah, I’m right here with you”.

“For fucksakes, Isaac…” I shook my head, he looked “What?! They’re invading, I’m standing our ground!!!”.

“I didn’t say redecorate my entire fuckin’ house with double ought buck while you’re plaster out your-” our argument was cut short as the sounds of more of them from the stairwell could be heard. “How about this: We clear this place of ghouls, and I’ll fund the reconstruction” Isaac quipped. With what money, Isaac? you sleep on my couch… or well, figuratively, or he’d be down there getting possessed and quartered by the neighborhood brigade right now. “We beat them before, we can do it again, let’s go” I asserted to him, he nodded and followed.

My laser scanned as we pushed into the hallway, Isaac cleared right as I pushed forward towards the stairs, he joined me as Zeus was at our feet sniffing ahead. I was on the left side of the hall, my laser aimed down the stairs, I could see the remnants of the door hinges torn clean off… they were rated for 3,500lbs of incoming force, whatever came through here did so with a vengeance.

We pushed down the stairs, my barrel leading the way and centered on the wide open front door as Isaac watched our flank. As I reached the ground floor, I shuffled right and pied around the opening, I could hear them running throughout the tall grass, laughing, whispering, eyes peeking out and then ducking back with speeds too quick for their hulking forms. all peeking through as they could see me better than my dual tubes could. Then from the tall grass, one of them bolted out. “Incoming!!!” I yelled, heading over to the doorway I fired as the gray mass closed the distance across my front area onto the porch. I fired rounds that cut through it’s back, lodged right in it’s body, black splashes filled the are and yet it still kept it’s momentum.

“Move!!-”.

That’s all I could get out as Isaac ducked right, Zeus barked as the thing charged and knocked me clean off my ass through the air and into my couch. It didn’t seem to care how many rounds I fired into it, I rolled off and groggily got a good lock. Its still human torso was the cross roads for a horrifying monstrosity where dog-like legs met an army that was that of a centipede, but the chitin was made out of calcified black flesh. The other one was seemingly made of glass and had gaps between bones, the head was fighting between several different mouths, gray and sunken into it’s torso… it’s sunken pin prick eyes centered on me

Whatever the hell happened to it, it decided to turn their soul into some sort of skin split thing. It’s voice was that of dozens, roars, yells, and yet it semi coherently all said: “Nolan”.

I tried to back up as it reached down, the centipede arm gnawing at my plate carrier, tearing through the nylon cordura as I fired into it’s torso sending chunks of flesh and bone flying out the back. Zeus lept on top zinking his teeth into it’s neck causing it to yell what sounded like a cross between a tiger and a ma. Isaac planted his shotgun right on the skull, the shot caused the entire thing to explode out which completely showered me… and I didn’t know what was worse: being covered in dead person or dead rotten beast.

I forced my buttstock into the ground, my head still rolling around as Isaac took point and looked to me: “How you feeling? You got knocked a country mile”.

I felt the base of my neck that still felt like it was on fire: “Been worse, landed right on my neck. “Quick, how many fingers am I holding up?”. “Isaac you’re not holding up any”. “See? You’re good”.

From the doorway to the kitchen, a set of elongated arms connected to a body that was stretched and contorted beyond human proportions. It stepped in bow legged, its face… a human skull that had been buried and pushed into the collar bone area sat below a smooth, angler fish like top portion. Two sets of jaws forced together, formed some horrifying maw that just hurt to look at,  like knives being dragged down my bare bones. We quickly fired on it, it grabbed onto the ground around it and spat at us… that same tar like shit, Isaac was quicker that I was. Some of it hit directly on the plate carrier, eating into my ATAK. The smell was… awful, it began to fuck with me, I didn’t know it until well into it’s effects but soon I realized I was hallucinating.

My eyes burned, my nose doing everything it could to exorcize the feeling to no avail, the pounding noise in my head felt like screams and chants. It felt real, every gust of wind, everything was hypersensitive. I scanned around, the ground unsteady, then it lunged at me. I could feel it’s claws slashing into my skin, I screamed and fired at it although it just degloved my arms like it was nothing, I could see the veins and blood underneath as it threw me into a wall and it gave in. I stood up and I was back… upstairs? The thing came charging down and I managed to clip the human skull underneath, causing it to stumble. As it did I fired, the flash of my suppressor under nods short, small, yet controlled as I tore through one of it’s legs.

It then reached out and hooked my jaw…. Then pulled and yanked it clean off. The feeling of my tongue flapping around, my gasps for air… I dropped my rifle to it’s sking as it slashed at my face. I fell to the ground, back in the living room… Zeus was now gnawing at it’s head as it reached for him.

Not. My. Fuckin. Dog. I fired an entire magazine into it, having switched to auto it tore through it’s center off mass. I then charged forward and tackled it to the ground, the armored knuckles on my gloves being buried into it’s head. It’s elongated arms tried to reach and tear through my plates, I didn’t care, hell I took off my helmet and began to pound it over, and over, with the clear side of my kevlar. The burning feeling it had on my corneas combined with a chorus of screams that just wouldn’t end, I would make it end. It’s head snapped back as it began to be crushed, soon the vortex-like swirls that formed it’s eyes began to snap back… looking human, and looked… like me.

Isaac threw me to the ground, I gasped as I could feel the clear air again, my vision normal as the property, the house… everything was silent. Zeus was sat in the center carpet… surrounded by dozens of malformed, transformed adversaries that were now spending their last seconds on this earth bleeding out. I sat up, catching my breath. I looked around… the beast with the elongated arms was laying on the floor, it’s head completely pulverized… my helmet embedded into it. I looked to Isaac, I’ll be honest I was shaken the fuck up “W-What the fuck…”.

“Yeah you lost your shit… a bunch of them began to pour in, you were firing wildly, you started tearing them apart…” he said, I raised an eyebrow, I didn’t remember that and I still don’t but I looked around. There was a hole in my wall wide open into my kitchen… some sort of hound like beast, skeletal with blood and muscle being it’s only exterior had it’s throat ripped out and my multitool stuck in its skull. My rifle was on the ground, bolt locked to the rear amongst several others.

“I don’t hear anything else…” I said, staggering to my feet. “Yeah, I think we might’ve gotten them all…” Isaac said, he paused for a moment, looking around “Okay, no jinxing us this time, I think they’re actually all dead… or escaped”. I quickly cleared and replenished my rifle, Isaac and I secured the kitchen and basement, right around when we got primary power back on… my radio crackled to life.

\[“November-1, sitrep…”\] it was Montgomery’s voice. I looked to Isaac before hitting the push-to-talk; \[“This is November-1, just experienced an attack on my residence, it got kinetic… we’re still alive but in a bad way… how copy?”\].

A few seconds of static, some failed key-in attempts… Montgomery answered \[“Roger that… we’ve got an organization wide attack… stay put and prepare the best you can”\]. Isaac scoffed, rolling his eyes he kicked the mangled remains of something that was formerly intruding, now decomposing “yeah, tell manchester it’s a little late for that”.

\[“November-1 to Main, I’ve got several dozen EKIA, I need reinforcements-”\].

What he said next planted a deep pit in my stomach: \[“Dozens of PEXU solo units have not reported back in, November-1. We’re barely able to take accountability. Hunker down the best you can and we will be coming for you… Main-Out”\]. There Isaac and I stood in my house, I sighed as he slung his shotgun, looking around “Well…. Nail and boards?”.

I pinched the bridge of my nose; “What are we going to just board up all the holes and sit next to the radio?”. We did, it took around 25 minutes however Isaac and I successfully and haphazardly re-secured the house. Occasionally we would hear the sound of something outside, neither of us went to look however we did keep our weapons ready, nothing would attack again. In the morning the sound of an SUV approaching after the sun rose above the horizon cautioned all three of us to approach, my suppressor and his barrel sticking out gaps in the boards.

The blacked out vic parked in my driveway, the door opened and a young man in a navy suit, slicked back hair exited. He kept his hands up, only moving one to take his sunglasses off…. Montgomery chuckled at the state of things before he looked at the structure: “I’ll take it, you’ve had a very entertaining night, November-1?”.

I drew my barrel back from the opening and peeked through “You can say that… how’s everyone else doing?”. The smirk on his face faded as he sighed, approaching “SMUs survived intact, many weren’t touched for obvious reasons… others like yourself, intelligence personnel… well, let’s just say we’ve got less comrades than when the night started”. That’s where we are at right now; Isaac and I are still holding down the fort, surprisingly we’ve gotten the actual structure resecured but let’s just say it won’t be pretty for some time. I don’t plan on leaving anytime soon… this place is my home, I hid here when I wanted to step away, and I don’t plan on running off again. PEXU has taken a considerable amount of casualties, though we’ve sustained it… it’s time for us to hunker down, lick our wounds, and soon we will be counter attacking. Don’t think it’s over, it’s not, just a little bit shot to hell right now… we’ll get back to it.

We’ll take it to them, their home, their blood… Montgomery has also said PEXU is interested in looking into whatever Theodor Cazamoth has been doing… because that black ichor we found on many of those bastards that tried to gut Isaac, Zeus, and I? They match samples recovered from a facility found on the east coast, one that 4th Special Forces Group touched down at a few years ago…. The same substance I encountered while I was defending Cazamoth’s estate.

It’s not over, we’ll be back.
