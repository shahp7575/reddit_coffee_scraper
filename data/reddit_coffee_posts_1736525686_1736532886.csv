I am working to pay for community college currently. I am 18. I work with eight men and one other woman. The men are ages 16-55. Most of them encourage bad behavior but do not touch me. The overall vibe vibe here sucks. The one who is 55 is hands on.

These are things he does regularly:

-breath on my neck or kiss my neck while I'm on the phone taking a customers order

-spank me when I walk by

-hides my belongings in his pocket and makes me reach in to take it out

-cornered me and wouldn't let me leave until I drank some of his coffee

-purr at me?


I should note that this man speaks very limited English as do most of my coworkers. My boss does not speak English but his wife does. So I complain to her and she says deal with it the mature way by speaking to him about how I feel.

I have decided to quit my job soon to find a new one. My parents are very strict and I'm expecting them to interrogate me about why I would quit without a new job lined up. I have applied to a lot of jobs and haven't gotten a call back anywhere.

I absolutely will not tell them the real reason because there will be a huge over reaction and I could possibly be banned from working again or lots of restrictions on me will be out in place.

I cannot think of a good excuse why I would quit a job that had perfect hours that I needed.

I am feeling a lot of stress because I don't feel like I have any good options. I just want to complain somewhere.

My parents have asked me a lot how work is going and if it's good and I just say yes it's great because any complaint will lead to an interrogation.",1,1736532630.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

I am thinking about starting a nice cam studio if that is possible. The women there are very poor and if they don’t have a high level degree, they can become a prostitute or cam to make money. No judgement. 

The internet isn’t great here unless you pay a lot, which I do. The women can’t afford computers, cameras, microphones, toys (obviously some have them) and things like that. I want to provide a clean atmosphere where everything is sanitized after a model uses the room. I want to provide high speed internet, fast computers, 4k cameras, good microphones, lights, toys, etc. A break room with coffee and beverages. And maybe even costumes for them to use, if they want. 

I have heard horror stories about cam studios. Realistically I think the studio needs to own the account to start, create Insta accounts for the women and promote and manage these sites. At some point, maybe based on the number of followers, I want to turn everything over to the women. All of the accounts. And I want them to have a contract stating this. If they want to stay camping at the studios and paying us a cut great. If they want to take their accounts to their home or another studio, that would also be their option.  No strings attached. 

What is a fair percentage cut for a studio?  At what number of followers should the woman own the accounts? What are your worst experiences with studios and how do I not do that? Any thoughts are appreciated.

1hyao6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_elipiticalorbit/comments/1hyao6f/ten_years/,Ten Years,"TLTR: Ten years-ago today, (1/10/15), I quit drinking thanks to this site. 

This post has been ten years in the making. Prior to this, my story was like many here. Years of alcohol abuse with many attempts at quitting. My periods of abstinence lasted anywhere from two days, two weeks, two months, two years, and a particularly good run of five-and-a-half years followed by an eight-and-a-half-year relapse. 

Like many others here, I came from an alcoholic’s home. I was on my own at sixteen after both parents died from alcohol-related diseases. I knew I was at a higher risk of alcohol abuse and promised myself I would not fall into the same trap. I managed to keep that promise through college. However, after obtaining my first post graduate job I fancied myself as being all grown up and surely able to handle a few drinks after work. You know the rest of the story. 

For the next decade, in my twenties and early thirties, weekend house parties, after work gatherings and other special events were ubiquitous. Given the opportunity, I tended to overindulge but somehow having the luck to not take it too far. That is not to say I did not make a fool of myself a few times, just did not do any physical damage or have any run-ins with the law. 

By this time, I was married, (no kids) to a woman who for some reason put up with this foolishness. However, I could see the disappointment in her each time she had to wake me up after passing out on the couch. The coolness in her demeanor when every restaurant choice or outing was based on availability of alcohol. The list became tiresome.

I did stop drinking a few times during this period, including a stint of two years. Each time I decided to start again, it was always with the idea that I had learned from the last time, and I had this in control. Within weeks of relapsing, I would be back to and surpassing my earlier levels of consumption. It was at this point that I started to deceive my wife. I would bring home the ‘legitimate’ six-pack and put it in the main fridge and out of that, drink two a night. Meanwhile, I would have several high alcohol content pints of IPA, and a bottle of wine secreted in my computer bag.

From the time I was a teenager I always stayed up late, turning in at around 2:00am. My wife on the other hand was usually in bed by 10:00pm as she had to go to work earlier, and this was just her nature. As a result, between 10:00pm and 2:00am I would hang-out in the basement TV room and get hammered.

Along with my preference for staying up late, I also had the ability to get by on four to five hours of sleep a night. This allowed me, after stumbling into bed at 2:00am to get up at 6:30am and be at work at 7:15am every fucking morning for forty-five years, but I digress. A big drawback of this plan was bottle management. Sneaking the alcohol in and the empties out was exhausting. Just like you rotate liquor stores for supply, I had trash dumpsters mapped out all over town for disposal.

Waking up every morning was terrifying. I had a mental checklist that I would process each morning. I’d reach over and check to see if my wife was still in bed, if she wasn’t it meant I was so drunk that I was making too much noise in bed, thrashing around or loud mumbling and she went to sleep on the couch. Second, I’d try to remember what happened the night before. Did I do anything at work while I was remoted in? Did I send anybody a text or email? What the fuck did I do on the internet? What did I do with the empties? Did I get rid of all the evidence? 

During this same time, I was doing surprisingly well in all other parts of my life. I quit smoking, took up healthy eating and started running to the point of completing two marathons and serval international running events. My career in IT skyrocketed, never slowing down. We built a house, traveled extensively, and had a really enjoyable time. I was fortunate for reasons I cannot explain to never have encountered serious repercussions from my drinking. No divorces, DUIs, suspensions or firings. And no run-ins with the law. To this day I cannot fathom my luck.

However, in my late forties I had an incident at work where I was outright betrayed by my boss. It had nothing to do with my performance but involved a dispute with HR where I would not hand over user log information when they did not have a policy that justified their request. I showed up with an attorney at my disciplinary hearing at which point HR said never-mind, and dropped the whole thing to run off and write a policy. This led me into an eighteen-month depression as my boss had made no attempt to back me, knowing I was right.

This depression resulted in me ceasing all physical activity, started smoking again, gained thirty pounds, and increased my alcohol consumption by double. At this point my preference was still for beer and wine. However, this was at the beginning of the craft beef craze; one of the hallmarks being its ridiculously high alcohol content. My sole criteria for choice of beer became its ABV content, wouldn’t bother with anything under 10%, usually going for something in the 11-14% range. Two or three pints of these would knock me on my ass.

Luckily at this point I got disgusted and fed up with myself. I saw myself becoming my father and knew how this was going to end. My depression was a result of this irrational hate I carried around for my boss and I finally realized I had to let it go. In April of 2001, I quit smoking and two weeks later quit drinking. One book that really helped me was Anne Fletcher’s Sober for Good. Its premise is that the author simply asks people who have quit for more than five years, ‘how and why did you do it?’  In most part their answers matched my motives and methods; I had enough, and I was just going to quit.

I was surprisingly successful. Something clicked. I went on a diet, loosing forty pounds in six months, trained for and ran my third marathon and made it through 9/11 without drinking. Icing on the cake, a year later my boss was fired for lying. I was offered his position, which I accepted but only on an interim basis as I was not interested in seating behind a desk and being stuck in meetings all day.

For five years, five months and two weeks I did not think of alcohol except to occasionally reflect on how good life was without it. I could not imagine it ever being a part of my life again, until it was. Just shy of my five- and half-year sober anniversary the idea returned that I got this. This resulted in an eight-and half-year relapse, culminating in plastic bottle vodka and day-drinking which closed out the last year and a half of this endless decline into an abyss.

At this time, I was within five years of a very lucrative retirement after a highly successful and long career. No one knew or at least I was never confronted about my drinking life. I could always rally myself enough to make it into work, seriously never missed a day, whether I was in any condition to be there was another case. I’d be the first one in, so I could get my coffee and bury myself in my keyboard and screen before the others showed up. Always promising myself this was going to change. I’ll quit next week, yeah, next week it will be great, cannot wait….. By noon, I would be fully recovered and feel good about my new resolve to quit. By 3:00pm I would be remembering what liquor store was in the rotation for tonight’s stop with great anticipation. Rinse and repeat.

But now my drinking had progressed to a level that I couldn’t believe I had allowed myself to obtain. I was experiencing physical pain and became very aware of where my liver was. I was at the literal finish-line, and I was putting everything at risk in the name of alcohol. I knew that this was non-sustainable, this had to stop, or I would be dead within five years.

On the weekend of January 10-11, 2015, my wife was going to visit a girlfriend for the weekend in an adjoining city. This of course meant I had the weekend to get wasted without guardrails. Problem was I decided to start early on Friday night. Like other times, my wife came down and found me passed out at 3:00am with a half-full glass of vodka next to me. The look of disappointment hit like a mortar. I knew I ruined her weekend. Instead of enjoying the city with a friend, she’d now be questioning everything.  She left in the morning without saying more than goodbye.  I of course proceeded to get wasted; the alcohol wasn’t going to drink itself.

Sometime on Sunday morning I woke up feeling like I’d never felt before, paranoid, nauseous, and extremely anxious. I realized later that I was having physical withdrawal symptoms, something that I had avoided all this time. I felt lost. I knew I had to quit. I knew I was killing myself.

I also knew I had been through this before which was both comforting and terrifying – what if I failed again? I decided it didn’t matter; I had to try. Spent Sunday sober and in silence. My wife really wasn’t into talking after returning home. On Monday, I made it into work and started looking up local resources, even looked up location and times for AA meetings. Thanks to Google search, I saw a link to r/stopdrinking which led me to a site called Reddit, which I had never heard of before.

As soon as I started reading the postings I knew I found what I needed. I knew AA and even SMART wasn’t going to work for ME, emphases on me. What did and does work for me was listening to anonymous strangers going through the same damn thing I am and figuring out ways to reclaim themselves and their lives.

There is no magic at r/stopdrinking. Everyone here lays it out and understands you must do the hard work. Trying to imagine life without alcohol can seem insurmountable. And all we can do here is share what has worked for each of us.

What helped me was understating and visualizing that alcohol is a literal chemical poison. The rush of warmth you feel when it hits your gut is your body reacting to another five-alarm fire that is about to hit and affect every organ in your body in a detrimental way. There was no longer an awake moment when I was not consuming alcohol. My short sleep cycles were offering no time for recovery. Again, I was killing myself.

I would like to end with an ‘everything is great’ supportive message, and I will, but not without a caution. It really is great, I am still alive. Being alcohol free these last ten years has been wonderful. I’ve built trust back with my wife. I got to retire. Me and my family made it through Covid. We are fortunate to afford frequent travel and be involved in interesting projects around the house and community. Best of all, at 70 my wife and I are in great health – completed two more marathons!

What is the caution? This shit never ends, you must stay on top of this. I have had a five- and half-year period of abstinence and then relapsed. Now after ten years of sobriety, I also know that it only takes one drink to turn this success on its ass. I know that if I were to drink again it would be the thing that kills me. I am running out of runway and do not have too many, (any) recovery cycles left so I cannot afford to screw this up. 

I check-in to r/stopdrinking often and will continue to do so. This site saves lives.

Thank-you

Caffeine is a huge problem for me.  I’m on Day 5 of no sugar/ no gluten (different issue, I know) and wanted to quit caffeine at the same time, but couldn’t bear the thought.  I switched to black coffee (used to add cream and sometimes maple syrup) to make it less enjoyable, hoping I would then just cut back.  Now I think I’ve acquired a taste for black coffee!  Anyway, I did see a YouTube video that explained using caffeine pills to cut down, so I’m contemplating that.  I’m scared to go without the bean juice.

Baguette diamonds offer a unique, elegant option for accent stones in jewelry. Here are the key points to know:

* Long, rectangular shape with 14 facets
* Used primarily as accent stones in rings and other jewelry
* Less sparkle than round brilliants, but provide a sleek, modern look
* More affordable than many other diamond cuts
* Require careful setting to protect against chipping
* For buyers seeking understated elegance at a lower price point, baguettes can be an excellent choice as side stones or in channel settings.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing [from trusted retailers such as those](https://labdiamondsreview.com/diamonds/) that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Who is this for?

* Jewelry buyers looking for affordable accent diamonds
* Those who appreciate vintage or art deco inspired designs
* Shoppers wanting to add visual interest to a center stone without overshadowing it

# Who is this not for?

* Buyers wanting a highly brilliant, sparkly diamond as a center stone
* Those prioritizing durability in their diamond selection
* Shoppers looking for a standalone diamond rather than an accent stone

# Recommendations for smart buying

1. Prioritize cut quality to maximize the limited facets
2. Opt for higher clarity grades (VS2 and above) as inclusions are more visible
3. Consider protective settings like channels to prevent chipping
4. Compare prices across retailers - baguettes can vary widely in cost
5. Examine the stones closely for symmetry and proportions

# FAQ

A: Typically between 1.50 to 2.40, but personal preference plays a role.

Q: Do baguette diamonds sparkle like round brilliants?

1hyaaq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialFiction/comments/1hyaaq9/beige_the_color_of_mediocrity/,Beige: The Color of Mediocrity,"Richard stared at the wall. It wasn’t the first time he’d been caught in its grasp, but something about the shade had shifted. Not visibly, not measurably, but profoundly. It was beige—unassuming, inoffensive, utterly ordinary. A wall meant to blend in, to vanish behind furniture and thought. Yet now it stared back at him.  

He blinked.  

The faintest ripple ran through the paint, a tremor in the stillness. He shifted uncomfortably on the threadbare couch, wondering if he'd fallen into that half-sleep where the mundane twists into the absurd. But no, he was awake. His coffee cup, still full, sat steaming on the wobbly table beside him. The room was silent. Oppressive.  

His wife, Eleanor, was upstairs, her movements muted by the thick carpeting. She hated the wall. ""It’s a nothing color,"" she'd declared on the day they moved in. ""We’ll paint it. Tomorrow."" Tomorrow became years, and now the wall remained, a monument to inaction.  

A sharp knock at the door jolted him upright.  

He glanced at the clock—3:33 a.m.  

""Who the hell...?"" he muttered, rising slowly. The floorboards creaked beneath his weight, each step a reluctant surrender. He opened the door to nothing. Just the street, bathed in the jaundiced glow of a flickering streetlamp.  

He hesitated. Something brushed past him, cool as a draft but tangible, like a body slipping through unseen. The hairs on his arms stood at attention. Shivering, he closed the door and returned to the couch.  

The wall was waiting.  

The beige seemed deeper now, richer, like it had soaked in the dim light and grown heavy with it. A faint hum buzzed in his ears, low and insistent. He touched the wall without thinking, his fingers grazing its surface. Warm.  

“Richard?” Eleanor’s voice floated down the stairs, sleepy, disoriented.  

He didn’t answer.  

The warmth grew. His palm pressed harder against the wall, and then—it wasn’t a wall anymore. It moved. The texture under his hand shifted, softening, writhing. He snatched his hand back and stumbled away.  

“What the hell?” he whispered.  

Eleanor appeared at the top of the stairs, her robe hanging limp over her frame. “What are you doing?” she asked, her tone accusatory, as if catching him in some absurd betrayal.  

He pointed. “The wall. It… moved.”  

She squinted, stepping closer. Her expression changed as she reached the bottom stair. She saw it. Her face went slack, drained of defiance, then of comprehension. She stumbled backward, gripping the banister.  

“You see it too,” Richard said, his voice cracking.  

The wall pulsed. It was faint, like the rhythm of a distant drum, but unmistakable. The beige had deepened further, darkening to something almost metallic, almost alive. It wasn’t beige anymore. It wasn’t anything anymore.  

“We need to leave,” Eleanor said, her voice sharp now, cutting through the fog in his brain.  

The door rattled.  

Richard turned toward it, heart hammering. The rattling grew louder, then stopped. In its place came a voice—soft, patient, devoid of urgency. ""Nothing is ever truly neutral,"" it said.  

“Who’s there?” Richard shouted.  

The voice didn’t answer. Instead, the beige surged outward, expanding in slow, deliberate waves. It spread across the room, devouring furniture, swallowing shadows. The coffee table dissolved into it. The carpet blurred, frayed, and vanished.  

Eleanor screamed.  

“Run!” she yelled, bolting toward the front door.  

Richard followed, but the beige was faster. It reached the door before they could, and when Eleanor grabbed the knob, her hand sank into it. She yanked it back, but her skin came away mottled with the same terrible, shifting hue. She fell to her knees, clutching her wrist, her voice a garbled mixture of sobs and incoherent words.  

The voice returned, closer this time, a whisper in Richard’s ear. “You chose this.”  

“I didn’t choose anything!” he shouted, spinning around, searching for its source.  

The beige pulsed again, stronger now, beating like a heart. It was everywhere, in the walls, the ceiling, even the air. Richard’s breath came short, his lungs filling with something thick and cloying.  

Eleanor’s screams stopped.  

He turned to find her standing, her eyes vacant, her skin drained of color. Beige. She looked at him, her lips moving silently. Then she stepped backward into the wall and was gone.  

“No!” Richard lunged after her, but the wall was solid again.  

The voice laughed. It wasn’t soft anymore. It was cruel, mocking, triumphant.  

The beige surged forward, wrapping around Richard like a cocoon. He struggled, gasping, clawing at it, but it was no use. It seeped into him, through his skin, his eyes, his mouth.  

And then he understood.  

He *had* chosen this. Every moment of indecision, every shrug, every resigned sigh. Every time he let the world pass him by, every time he settled for less. The beige had always been there, waiting, patient and inevitable.  

The wall pulsed one last time, then stilled.

I am looking for a new, serious espresso machine and hope to get some advice in making the right choice here. I am based in Spain and I'll be pairing the machine with a Timemore Sculptor 64s (which seems to be the best value for money for what I've researched).

I drink only espresso (I don't like milk!) and I do 2-3 shots per day, 4 times a week. I want to experiment with all kinds of different roasts, so I want something that can brew dark to light roasts effectively. I occasionally have friends over that like milk-based drinks so I would like a steam wand but I figured getting a single-boiler machine would be best. What I think I should care about is temperature stability, pre-infusion and flow control. Heat-up times are not too important.

After lot's of research, I landed upon the ECM classika PID. It seems to be what I am looking for with PID and flow control (if/when I upgrade). I also love the look of the machine and the tactile experience of flipping the lever. I am aware of other options such as the Profitec GO (cheaper but no manual pre-infusion/flow control) or the Silvia Pro X (more expensive for dual boiler but no manual pre-infusion/flow control).

So my question here is: am I on the right track? Am I missing something? Is there another machine at that price range that has better temperature stability and is future-proof, allowing me to discover different styles and playing with flow/pre-infusion better? Am I better off spending another 500 euros and getting something significantly better?",2,1736531205.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

[Breville Barista Express Impress],"I just got my Breville Barista Express Impress last week and have had a lot of fun (and wasted a lot of coffee) dialing in! 

The current bag I am dialing in is so close to being perfect with 18g in the hopper & 36g out in the 25-30 second range. I am pulling 34g in about 29 seconds on a grind size of 7 but if I go any coarser, the shot is closer to 30g in 25 seconds. I also have noticed that if I use a puck sheen with these settings, it’s even slower. I’d like to use a puck screen to keep my group head clean but it’s not a deal breaker. 

For puck prep: I am using a WDT and distribution tool prior to using the tamp that’s built into the machine. I’m waiting on a spring loaded tamp to come from Amazon. 

TLDR: A grind size of 7 is what has gotten me the closest to 36g out but unsure if I should mess with the inner burr to fine tune the shot or maybe go up to 18.1g or 18.2g of beans?

Is it because i got them across the river? I put teamster ports on every island and even an extra teamster port next to the fish farm. When i put emergency job it says i cant transport these goods. Same with my corn farm too. My other corn farms work fine on the main land. 

Another question is, adding a second port is a bad idea? I got 2 ports now but it doesnt seem to make a difference. Pretty much ever since ive only acquired crippling debt and am now in a hole of not being able to buy roads to connect my extra corn farm and new coffee farm to the road.

Sorry that its so long.","'ve known this girl for about a year now. She is from Israel and is 21 years old. I am from the U.S and 24 years old. We met at college. She is studying to be a vetenarian, while I'm trying to be a surgeon. It started in organic chemistry lab. I was alone and needed a partner, so did she and we became partners for the semester. The first day of meeting her was very cordial, with asking each other where we were from and what we were studying. The next couple of weeks went by and everything was going smoothly. I happened to ask where she sat in the lecture portion of the class and she responded with I sit alone near the middle and come sit with enthusiasm. Over the next couple of weeks she then would invite me to study in the library especially on the days we had lab together. During the studying we never really studied together because both of our study techniques are very different, but she always insisted of going to the library. We always used to sit right next to each other than across the table. Right around the time of when Iran attacked Israel with the ICBM attack in 2024 she became very different. Some days she would show up late to class and not even sit by me. The biggest switch was we had went to the library and as I pulled the chair out from right beside her, she snapped at me and said why do I feel the need always sit right next to her. To my response I was caught off-guard and said I don't know and from then on out I never sat right next to her. Also, during that semester there was no tables available in the library so we had chosen a booth area to study for the time being. We were both in the process of scheduling classes together and she had adjusted her own schedule just to have the same lab time as me for Organic chemistry 2. During the process we didn't really study much and we got on the topic about how her older brother is dating an older woman and she had made an odd comment about how if she was a year older she would be more comfortable. I was very confused and didn't say anything in response. As the class went on for about the final 4 weeks she continued to be moody and not like her usual self. Some days she would be talkative asking me questions to not really saying hello. But all in all she still sat by me and insisted about studying in the library together.

So, now class has ended, and summer has begun. Throughout the whole summer she never texted once. I figured she would text if she wanted to, so I never gave her one text throughout the whole 3 months of summer. A day before class starts she asks how was summer and If I was still in Organic chemistry 2 together and what time my lab portion was also. This is confusing to me because why would she ask me about the time when she sat there right with me and made her schedule? Anyways I responded and told her when it was and she said cool I'll see you then. I sat near the back but I was kind of hurt a bit since she never even texted me throughout the whole summer so I played quiet and waited if she would make a bit of an effort. Which she did the first day. I saw her wander the aisles aimlessly looking for me until we made eye contact and she then sat right next me. Again she asked If I was going to the library to study and of course I said yes and then she followed. The first couple of weeks were pretty good. She then asked me in vague question with was I studying for the test late after lab one day and I responded what do you want to do? and she responded with to study for the test on a certain date and I obliged. After lab this semester I had been giving her a ride home. During the car ride she would sit pretty close to me. She also started to communicate that her friends and roommates were bad influences by encouraging her to smoke marijuana and they were also loud. Which was preventing her from studying efficiently.  During a short three day break I had got the courage and asked her out to lunch hoping for a date, but she stated over text as friends which I never even pursued the lunch thing after that. We then got to class that week together and she wasn't awkward at all, but I was pretty quiet. To be honest I was really hurt and didn't want to be mean to her but for a good couple of weeks I didn't study at all with her at the library and just left without saying. Now after this there was weird moody relationship between the two of us for the rest of the semester. Somedays she was super happy and others she was awkward and almost would storm off without saying anything after class. She stopped texting me as much but continued to sit by me and also continued to study at the library together. I've been experiencing some health problems with digestive systems and I divulged all this information to her one day after class and said I was sorry for being moody. I didn't mean to create a problem if I did. She was really receptive and started to act like her normal self again while checking on me. Towards the last month and half before the semester had ended, I had started to ask her if she was available and I was trying to plan a date between just me and her. She was always honest and told me that she had already made plans. I clearly was just asking at a bad time. the last 2 weeks of school I had asked if she would be available after finals. I also texted her a message about how I like the friendship we had created over the time and I would love to hang out with you outside of school even if its just as friends. She responded with she felt the same and she would be available after finals maybe. We'll I waited after the final test we had together and she hit me with why are you still here in a tone that I wasn't expecting. I responded with well I was just waiting to see how the test went for you. I then asked her like always if she wanted a ride home and she very sternly said no and I said Ok. and then she stormed off again. 

Now she hasn't texted me at all since the break had started until a week before this next semester had started. She had asked me with how my winter break is going and If the doctors had found anything with my health problems that I had been experiencing. Of course being once again hurt I didn't really want to text her, but out of politeness I responded, but kept it short and brief. I responded with my breaks been good, how was yours and no not yet but I have scan in a few days. She responded with she was in israel and visiting family again. She then messaged me if I was excited for next semester and I responded with ehh not really. She then responded with because of classes or other things. I just responded with kind of. 

To be honest I don't know what I should do Biblically as a believer in Christ. I really do admire and like this girl a lot. I would do anything in my possible nature to help her out with anything that I can do. I'm just hurt with all of things as mentioned above. I just don't know if that I even should be texting her. When I think about just cutting her off and blocking her, I just want to cry because she really wasn't that mean to me and I'm not that type of person. I have been losing sleep and dropping weight and this constant worrying is clearly not helping me. I just don't know why she even wants to be around me if we don't even really study together. Also, why would she only invite me to the coffee shop to study when she could have asked any other person in the class. Because she knows other people besides me.",1,1736530869.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

(Update 2),"In the last 3 weeks after the incident a lot has occurred. My sister came from her boyfriend's place on New years day and spent 3 days with my parents. I was apprehensive about talking to her, though I know that it needed to be done.

She said what she needed to first. In this, she apologized about her attitude at that time, citing that she was close to her period and was getting emotional and was even more anxious, etc. She also apologized for fat shaming me and for giving me whip lash, etc.

I brought up the incident that occurred at my home and how it made me feel after apologizing for what I had done. I feel as thought we understood each other's boundaries and needs better. Here's where it gets interesting and I don't know what to make of it.

I explained that I had set a boundary and that they'd walked all over it. I now realize that, along with feeling embarrassed and dehumanized, I also feel that my trust was violated. Here are some key points about what she had to say. 

She apologized for the incident. They care for me and didn't want to have me dig and even deeper and darker hole for myself. After our friend had told her about the situation, she had lied and said that she also needed the bathroom. 

They were looking for any signs that I was slipping and, to them, this was a clear sign to them that I was not okay. I explained that work, not giving a duck and laziness were to blame for the state of my place. It's not as though I had a mental breakdown and tore the apartment apart. 

I also apologized then for seemingly lying to them about the harm tool, explaining the situation. I never meant to hurt them even more or break their trust. I had slipped, and I'm trying not to again. 

I wasn't fully satisfied with the conclusion. She wasn't realizing that they'd just stepped over my boundary, a mere simple request if you will. She then left the following morning to her city. We are on better terms and didn't get into a shouting match. 

I'd told my friend that, if she was up to it, we could go walk around in the mall. She had invited us for coffee earlier. I thought we were gonna discuss the situation together, but then her sister and cousin were also there. I really wish we'd taken time to talk it out together.

She set a date and we first bought some bits for school. We then went to the other mall. On the way, we started to talk. She told me what my sister had told her. She wasn't happy about the fact that I'd said that she had gone into my apartment on purpose. 

For this, I apologized. It wasn't fair of me to attack her character like this. I explained why I felt like this. I'd told them in the mall about my boundary after hearing that I needed my script to get the medication. She had said that she wanted to see the place.

I know my friend. She can sometimes be extremely nosy. It wasn't fair of me to just come up with that conclusion based on this. She genuinely needed the bathroom after drinking the entire energy drink that I'd bought her on the road back. I'm to blame there.

She also explained why she didn't ask for the toilet in the previous towns. My sister had said that she did ask in the town before the small town I lived in. I had just not heard in the back seat for some reason.

She was afraid to ask my sister because she was already tired and stiff from driving and irritated with me because I had forgotten the script and she had to driving out of the way to help me. I accepted that explanation.

The conversation became a little bit heated and both of us were quite shaken. She asked if I would rather go to a public restroom or a toilet that was supposed to be more clean. I said I would if someone had set that boundary with me.

I would understand if my friend said no to my sister just to prevent her head from being bitten off, something that I'd never really seen my sister do with her. That way their stories would correlate. 

After this whole fiasco, I feel emotionally drained and tired. I just want closure on this situation. I do think that they are done talking about the situation. 

What doesn't make sense is why she asked me in the street I lived in and not earlier. Perhaps my mind is just reading to much into the situation, searching for signs of alterior motives on ther part. 

On the one hand, if they had had alterior motives, the reason for blackmailing me and telling me that they'd gone all this way just to help me get my script would be logical. What I had told them about the apartment had raised red flags for them. As mentioned before, they are looking for signs before something happens. Maybe this happened for my best interest, even though it hurt me. I just wish they'd rather had a grown ass discussion with me before jumping to conclusions. 

On the other hand, I would be angry if they confessed to doing what my gut is telling me. It doesn't make sense. I would have heard questions about using the bathroom. They didn't need to ask me on the street to my place and guilt me. 

They could have asked me about stops. I would have helped them. If the roles were reversed, I would have stayed well within their boundary. It feels like they are trying to make excuses for their actions, even though I know that I shouldn't think like that. 

My friend did she also hadn't heard me in the mall when I had first set the boundary. I distinctly remember her remark right after. The stories aren't adding up. 

I still can't for the life of me see every area where I was the asshole. Certain facts make sense as to why I am, others not so much. It's eating at me. Am I just being self centered and ignorant to the gravity of the whole situation?

I don't know if there will be any more updates. We're all trying to find peace. It's not been easy. If there are any updates, I will post them here. ",1,1736530822.0,u_wren_shea_laine,1,0.99,False

So I made a post here a month ago about my symptoms with Dovato, which is my first ARV med I was prescribed with after being recently diagnosed. Basically, I was feeling weird the first two days, panicked and scheduled an appointment sooner with my doc, but ultimately decided to not go and keep taking it instead of going in to switch meds. Everything was great for a week or so, mostly no symptoms apart from my normal ones like brain fog/harder to concentrate and maybe some nausea but that goes away after 4 or 5 hours. As of recently, I've been having weird experiences that led me to believe maybe what I am experiencing is not so normal. About a week a go I've had 2 instances with working out after an hour or 2 from taking the pill and getting some chest pain and light headedness/low blood pressure maybe? (blood feels like its flushing in my body and feeling extreme fatigue/fainting feeling) and that kinda scared me so I stopped and moved exercises to before taking the meds instead.

I'm on my 5th week so far and now lately I'm also realizing that I am getting constipated and its been gradually carrying on til the next morning where I can finally let it go. So a couple days ago I tried drinking a couple sips of coffee with a meal and then taking the meds half an hour to an hour later. Bad idea, even though it was only a couple sips just so I could get my digestive going, because I started feeling what I felt when I exercised after taking the pill which is the chest pains, light headed, etc and I'm starting to think any excessive force/workout is bad while on it. The constipation stays stagnant regardless and lasted til the next morning when I finally felt normal. I could use the bathroom normally day after and everything happens only when I'm on my meds the previous day.

I'm just wondering if anyone deals with constipation constantly or if this isnt normal and I should just try for a different pill because I dont feel like this is normal? I was fine before, but now its getting to the point where I'm even debating having a third meal after taking my pill. If I dont force myself to let out gas or use the bathroom  ( which it wont even release a lot of the times till later on the day or even the next morning ) then I'll get this painful shocking pain in my abdomen. At first when I got that sort of pain I was thinking it was my kidneys or liver or something, but I'm thinking now its from being backed up because I feel fine after using the bathroom (although I'm not so sure because when I sit sometimes my abdomen feels a little bad). I really dont want to mess up my insides and my next appointment isnt til next Friday and dont know how to deal with this because there arent any openings til then.

They said I could benefit from a stimulant, but my regular psych wanted to see the results before making any decisions- Which I totally get! 

But I've been paying more attention to what is helping and what is not. For example I can drink coffee and pass out for 2-3 hours. It just relaxes me unless I have 3 ish cups. If I need to get things done, then I always reach for an energy drink, but those only work about 60% of the time.

Don't know if anyone remembers and/or cares but, I thought I'd give a little update.

It's colder and I'm a lot further behind than I thought I would be due to a multitude of reasons but, I've made some progress. Got a fancy electric got water bottle and a really good sleeping bag, dog has became accustomed to wearing a jumper to bed 😁
I've ripped the stables out, used wire brushes and rust converter on the box frame, red oxide and under sealed along with the chassis which was already pretty mint. 18mm marine ply subfloor with 3 coats of varnish (under sealed again). 50mm insulation board and 18mm ply floor on top again, 3 coats of varnish. Finally I've managed to get a bit of studwork and insulation (again 50mm board) on the walls.

Hoping to get the walls finished and studwork in for garage/raised living area this weekend and then I'm going to throw caution to the wind and rip out the living area in one go, as soon as the varnishing is done for the new subfloor (currently on coat 1).


It's more than liveable as it really. I've found it surprisingly comfortable and as mentioned, I've not got any heating, just the hot water bottle and it's really not been too bad. I just wear a few layers and drink a few more coffees. Haven't had much of an issue with condensation either, think I've managed it quite well. ",5,1736529304.0,VanLifeUK,1,1.0,False

1hy9cm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hy9cm2/im_being_followed_by_someone_who_looks_exactly/,I'm Being Followed By Someone Who Looks Exactly Like Me,"Saturday mornings always had a particular flavor, a mix of calm and routine. As usual, I woke up a little later, savoring the luxury of sleeping in. Outside, the weather was freezing, a fine drizzle falling against the windows, making the city even quieter than usual.

I got ready quickly, throwing on a thick coat and my favorite scarf before heading out. I needed to stop by the office to pick up some documents. A chore, but necessary. The streets were deserted, which was strange, even for a Saturday morning. Not a sound, not a single car. I reassured myself, thinking that the freezing weather must have kept everyone indoors. But as I walked, I couldn’t shake off an uneasy feeling, you know, like the one you get when you feel someone’s eyes on you but can’t figure out where it’s coming from.

I quickened my pace, refusing to look back. It was ridiculous, of course. I was alone. When I arrived at the office, everything went as usual. A few colleagues were there, chatting around the coffee machine. Nothing out of the ordinary. The day passed quickly, filled with the usual tasks.

On my way out, I stopped at the bakery to grab some bread. Once inside, as I reached for my wallet to prepare the change, I clumsily dropped my bag. Bending down to pick it up, I felt someone brush past me quickly. A silhouette I hadn’t noticed before, leaving the bakery. The scent of their perfume was eerily familiar, identical to mine. They were also wearing clothes similar to mine: a gray top, a long black coat, and boots just like mine. But I didn’t pay much attention to it, too busy gathering my things. After buying the bread, I headed home.

But that feeling of being watched came back, stronger this time. As I walked down the street leading to my house, my eyes were drawn to a window in the building across the street. Someone was there, standing behind the glass. A still figure that seemed to be staring at me, eerily dressed in a way that was very similar to how I was dressed. I stopped, uneasy, and as soon as our eyes met, the figure stepped back, disappearing into the shadows of the room. A cold shiver ran down my spine.

In the days that followed, things got worse. I started seeing that figure more and more often. Always from a distance, always at the same distance, always motionless. But every time I tried to approach, it disappeared. Then I began to notice troubling details. That person… they looked like me. Not just a little. It was me. But their gaze… that was what chilled me the most. Empty eyes and a smile… that smile was too wide, too rigid, as if it had been carved into their face.

One evening, as I was heading home, I saw them standing at the far end of the street. They didn’t move, didn’t make a sound. They just stared at me. I ran to my house, slammed the door behind me, and locked all the bolts. Out of breath, I spent the evening watching through the window. They weren’t there anymore. But I knew they would come back.

Then came that night. I was lying on the couch, casually watching an episode of Game of Thrones with a tub of Cookie Dough ice cream in hand (the best, no debate), when the power went out. The house was plunged into total darkness. I stayed still for a moment, listening to the silence, until I gathered the courage to head down to the garage and reset the circuit breaker. Once there, the garage door was slightly ajar. I knew I had closed it.

Across the street, under the flickering light of a streetlamp, I saw them. Motionless. But this time, something was different. They were… taller. Terribly tall. Their arms and legs seemed unnaturally elongated, their thin and emaciated body casting a grotesque shadow on the ground. I froze, unable to look away.

When I finally reset the breaker, the lights came back on, illuminating the street. They were closer now. Only a few meters away. I could see every detail: their face was identical to mine, but their eye sockets were empty, oozing a dark red liquid that looked like blood. Their smile had stretched far beyond the limits of what was humanly possible, revealing too many teeth, sharp and unnatural.

They didn’t move, but their gaze seemed to pierce through me. I dropped the flashlight and ran, without looking back, all the way to my apartment. There, I hid under my bed, trembling, my heart pounding wildly.

I don’t know how long I stayed there, but I heard them. Slow, dragging footsteps echoing through my house. Then a breath, long and cold, just on the other side of the door.",2,1736529148.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

For my first pull, I used supermarket coffee hoping it would get me by (the guy I bought it from had the same coffee)but it was horrific from the word go. It did help get me used to the machine. 

A day or two later, I got some beans from a local coffee shop and had them grind for me. Pulled them and the shots were too fast and somewhat sour. No worries, drowned it in milk and used the caffeine. Ordered the SK 40 that day.

I went back to the local coffee shop and picked up more beans and a shot of espresso in anticipation of grinding at home the next day. I got home and unboxed the grinder for use in the morning. 

First grind was too fine and low weight. On the sour side. I went again with a bit more courseness but still too fine. Third and final one for the day was still too fine but that being said, they all tasted better than the shop! 

I can't wait to dial this in and get some good coffee. I can't believe the difference with just having a grinder.

1hy99z5,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1hy99z5/im_being_threatened_to_refer_a_potential_intern/,"I'm being threatened to refer a potential intern, should I tell HR?","I graduated college last year and since announcing my job on LinkedIn, a lot of students from my school has been contacting me for a coffee chat. One student in particular was from a club I was previously the Co-President of, so I felt more comfortable. She asked me what I disliked about my job, company, and what I thought could be improved.

So, I straight up told her the truth. I warned her that our department is messy, there is a lot of politics in management, too much drama between our VP and CEO (they're married) and it comes down onto the people working with the VP, and that genuinely, I don't think this would be a good company for her to work in. Truthfully, I was looking out for her.

I shouldn't have ranted, but she reminded me a lot of myself at college and I wouldn't want her to work here or even with my team. The internship was specifically for my team, I know because she sent over the job posting and its basically what we do, and our VP was talking about wanting an intern.

Then, at the end of the call, she asked me for a referral. I told her no. I never worked with her professionally before, so I wouldn't feel comfortable vouching for her, and that I didn't want to lie or fluff it up. She was fine with it, we ended the call.

Today, I received an ""anonymous"" email from someone claiming they have a recording of me complaining about my job, my department, VP/CEO and that someone was going to put my name down for referral and I should let it through. Obviously, its her. I reached out to her to tell her I wouldn't be scared into referring, but she ignored me. Then, I receive a notification from HR that I had a referral request to confirm. The video is also really incriminating. It was a screen-recording of our conversation on zoom (my name and face was in it), but obviously, only cropped up to my face and not the girl.

Now, should I tell HR what happened? But that would also reveal her recording. I'm very nervous because they attatched my VP's email and HR's email in the anonymous email, so now I'm cornered.

1hy9166,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/1hy9166/this_is_the_fix/,This is the fix.,"Just wanted to come on here and give you all some hope, I’ve had psoriasis for over 1.5 years right now and i’m rather young, 19 years old. I’ve battled it for awhile and had it pretty bad on both my arms and scalp. However, the doctors all told me there’s no cure and prescribed me a cream and left it at that. I want to come here and tell you that there is a cure and it’s not that hard, in fact weeks you can massive improvements.

Lifestyle: -Get a fair amount of sun exposure each day. -Abstain or lower alcohol intake overall -Be mindful of your stress levels and meditate.

Diet: The real cure I believe your diet is strictly linked to your psoriasis, now I don’t know purely what causes it however I do know the diet that fixes it, so that’s all that matters.

Strictly eat:

* Real Meats (ideally higher quality)
* Fruits (abundant amount)
* Eggs (I eat to supplement calorie and protein intake)
* Salt + Organic Honey
* Dark chocolate high cocoa percentage (if you want a sweet snack)

Beverages I consume:

* Water
* Black coffee + honey for sweetness
* Wine in occasional dosages
* Tea

Id recommend strictly sticking to what i’ve listed, avoid vegetables, breads, carbs etc. If you don’t believe me, try it for a month and see the difference before knocking what I’ve said. If you want to be cured that’s up to you, i understand how annoying this shit is, but thankfully there is a cure and it doesn’t have to be western medicine!

Don’t make excuses eating healthy, and this way isn’t expensive if you spend the time to figure it out, buy meats in bulk from costco, local butchers ect, ground beef is always cheap , fruits are cheap, buy in bulk all organic. Trust me it’s far cheaper than eating out constantly.

Cons:

* Possibly price (although if you spend time to fix this part it’s really not that bad)
* Calorie surplus ( It can be hard to hit big calorie targets, use eggs to supplement this)
* Eating out can be a bit hard with friends ect as many restaurants won’t strictly accommodate

At the end of the day there is a cure and it’s really not to complicated, western medicine is an evil money grab that says their is no cure to psoriasis, i’ve tried their shit. Listen and try what i’ve said for 1 month, if im wrong atleast you’re healthy, but likely your psoriasis will improve greatly! 

  
For reference, its taken me 2.5 weeks to see massive improvements, it's about 80% cleared up and I'm 2.5 weeks in, It'll likely be fully gone in a few more weeks, I'll keep you all updated.",0,1736528350.0,Psoriasis,26,0.21,False

[https://news.maryland.gov/mda/press-release/2025/01/10/preliminary-testing-confirms-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-in-caroline-county/](https://news.maryland.gov/mda/press-release/2025/01/10/preliminary-testing-confirms-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-in-caroline-county/) \>>

**ANNAPOLIS, MD  (January 10, 2025)**— State laboratory testing has detected a case of **highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI)** in **Caroline County** following routine sampling of a broiler operation and investigation by the **Maryland Department of Agriculture**.  This marks the first case of H5N1 at a Maryland commercial poultry operation since 2023 and the third commercial operation in the Delmarva region in the last 30 days when two Kent County, DE returned positive results.

State officials have quarantined all affected premises, and birds on the properties are being or have been depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from affected flocks will not enter the food system.

Confirmation by the **U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory** is pending with final results anticipated in the coming days.

“High Pathogenic Avian influenza or HPAI does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain healthy and safe to eat and handle,” said **Maryland Department of Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks**. “The Maryland Department of Agriculture, local health department, USDA and partner organizations are working diligently to address the situation, including quarantining and testing nearby flocks. We continue to urge commercial growers and backyard flock owners to be on heightened alert for HPAI.”

Avian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among birds through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. This virus affects poultry, like chickens, ducks, and turkeys, along with some wild bird species such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and raptors.

According to the **Maryland Department of Health**, the risk of transmission between birds and the general public is low.  Those who work directly with poultry or dairy farms may be more at risk and should follow key biosecurity practices.

The Maryland Department of Agriculture recommends the following common-sense biosecurity steps if  HPAI is suspected on personal property , wild birds, or in a commercial operation. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has guidance for farmer workers [here](https://u46067669.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.8mqS6WVTTT36ZOXco-2Bt3sIBvQanI0a-2FlByvWuRuNirIxIC1H3TqZ1UMVAA6H2V8sp4bNbJSRUWjcbKRKFKvL5kNUn-2BN9VvjHcymmj4nAWMk-3D_L08_1-2FlQ5R7jXHW5rdNHc-2FQfdtcZef9ecZDDXp4Vi2lLLh0GkwuPbOvAYWAdXE-2FxWPHWvnuL1MgH67OGoE3vOjjNmYl2ELZfQphmF5vsoT2JEQhQa-2BUEQRiH4wSueeOBAe7DMEpEFaJMS1QR7HkD9Q14Cf8w4X-2Bg35fb5jcob8-2FfBY0XUfk3bvfAxPdyyAHfi2MWLy6zwh8salIehOccFFcYmLSY82Mox-2BgVhRZ-2FZoKQFmukbWF1ZFb7CARDraWHzd2nL4T1gvaUuYvWsEjzmLKvVY5XR-2FgLPa-2BAEDLm426mdmDSmvbeuKdRRn0C9wuuLNq00ugve83UeA3dM60O0makrcma440i0eidfl4ka9R-2BadE-3D).

* Report suspected sick birds:

* To report a possible case of HPAI call the Maryland Department of Agriculture at 410-841-5810.
* Commercial chicken growers and backyard flock owners can email questions about the outbreak to [MD.Birdflu@maryland.gov](mailto:MD.Birdflu@maryland.gov).

Key biosecurity practices:

* Clean and disinfect transportation. Don’t walk through or drive trucks, tractors, or equipment in areas where waterfowl or other wildlife feces may be. If you can’t avoid this, clean your shoes, vehicle, and equipment thoroughly to prevent bringing disease agents back to your flock.  This is especially important when visiting with farmers or those who hunt wild fowl such as when gathering at a local coffee shop, restaurant, or gas station.
* Remove loose feed. Don’t give wild birds, rodents, and insects a free lunch. Remove spilled or uneaten feed right away, and make sure feed storage units are secure and free of holes. Wild birds can carry HPAI.
* Keep visitors to a minimum. Only allow those people who take care of your poultry to come in contact with your birds,  including family and friends. Make sure everyone who has contact with your flock follows biosecurity principles.
* Wash your hands before and after coming in contact with live poultry.  Wash with soap and water. If using a hand sanitizer, first remove manure, feathers, and other materials from your hands because disinfectants will not penetrate organic matter or caked-on dirt.
* Provide disposable boot covers (preferred) and/or disinfectant footbaths for anyone having contact with your flock. If using a footbath, be sure to remove all droppings, mud or debris from boots and shoes using a long-handled scrub brush BEFORE stepping into the disinfectant footbath, and always keep it clean.
* Change clothes before entering poultry areas and before exiting the property. Visitors should wear protective outer garments or disposable coveralls, boots, and headgear when handling birds, and shower and/or change clothes when leaving the facility.
* Clean and disinfect tools or equipment before moving them to a new poultry facility. Before allowing vehicles, trucks, tractors, or tools and equipment—including egg flats and cases that have come in contact with birds or their droppings—to exit the property, make sure they are cleaned and disinfected to prevent contaminated equipment from transporting disease. Do not move or reuse items that cannot be cleaned and disinfected—such as cardboard egg flats.

I (21) am currently living with my parents at home to save on room and board for college. I am a full-time student, work 20+ hours a week, and consistently contribute to household chores and tasks.

As a family we drink a lot of milk and go through it pretty fast. My mom (53F) has always been the one to get the groceries, but since I got my license in high school, I have as well. It is rare for my dad to get family groceries.

My dad (50M) is very picky about food, and for as long as I can remember, gets very upset if he doesn't have the right drink with his food. If we have pizza, he needs Coca-Cola, if we have any dessert, he needs milk. Growing up, when we ran out of one of these drinks, it would upset him. Sometimes he would slam the front door as he left, sometimes he would leave without a word. My mom was always hurt by it, and it always confused me. Why couldn't he just drink water?

Well it snowed bad this week but I was able to dig my car out of the snow and pick up some drink items. I got juice and some milk.

Fast-forward to yesterday. Mom got sick, but works remote. We ran out of milk as well as other items making breakfast and coffee, so I updated our grocery app. I get out to my car and it won't start. She was running a meeting, so I text to let them know I needed to take her car, which was fine with her. It's 9:00, and my dad is still asleep, he was off work.

It's 11:30, I've been enjoying a lovely day at work. My dad hadn't responded to any of the family messages, but I receive this text from him:

""Can you please let me know when you drink the last of the milk so I can plan accordingly for my meals?""

He hadn't acknowledged my car troubles or that I was at work. He woke up 4 hours after the rest of us on his day off, which is fine. I respond:

""Hello, good morning to you too. I understand that you're frustrated, mom or I are planning to go to the grocery store after work today. I made it to work safely and am having a nice day :) Hope you enjoy your day off”

His response:

""I'm sorry if that sounded rude. I didn't mean for it to. I would really like your help with that **issue**. I'm glad you made it safe to work, have a good day.""

Fair enough. I followed up by sharing the updates I made to our grocery app. **But Reddit, this is what I wanted to say to him:**

**""Thank you. I'm not sure what the issue is. I was raised to not cry over spilled milk. I am not responsible for helping you plan your meals. When we run out of my favorite drinks, I drink water and go on with my day because they are a luxury, not an essential to survive. That's more than most people have in this world, and I'm grateful. Are you?""**

I always want to give the benefit of the doubt, and be open to the idea that I am missing something. But I feel like there's something wrong with this behavior.

So, Reddit, AITA for drinking the last of the milk and not telling my dad immediately, when he is fully capable of buying groceries himself, or drinking water when it's needed?",44,1736527739.0,AmItheAsshole,141,0.73,False

Her reasoning is that she was trying to not hurt me and wanted to be sure and this and that, and I guess finally she couldn’t take it anymore and she said she’s more scared in hurting me more than losing me.

It’s kind of confusing bc we agreed the chemistry hasn’t died, I mean nothing happened in the relationship other than someone thought that the other person wasn’t meant to be with them forever. She wore the most special ring I got here which she said she did to do to get me to like her or not hate her bc she was hurt by me unfollowing her on IG. 

We agreed although this would never happen, that we could be friends with benefits with each other bc the sex is great, she said she would maybe have to tell her friends to grab her if she was drunk at a bar, but that her doubts about the relationship, about us being different people, took over and she can’t see a way back. 

Honestly she even tried to seduce me, she wanted to makeout with her and even at the end link arms as I walked her to my car but I’m so proud of myself for not giving in. 

It’s like this was another party girl all along. We boiled it down to that the fundamental difference between us is that I had those feelings of doubt too, of whatever she had, but I always came back to the belief that love is a choice. She thought that it was more of a feeling or a gut feeling that should be there. 

I wish i would’ve known sooner but I felt like I always carried the relationship on my back, I gave everything I got, I truly gave 110%, which meant she never got to show her true levels of commitment and effort I guess. She was always stressed out, I just wanted her to be successful, but since I propped up the relationship I didn’t get to see the cracks or even allow the cracks to form.

It feels like in the end she just showed that she wasn’t dependable. Although it hurts deeply and I’m still empty, I feel lighter, the confusing part is that we could probably still have sex, we’re both attracted to each other, and that’s why we said it would be dangerous to meet up again, but she wanted to get coffee over the summer 4-5 months from now but I don’t think I’m gonna do that.

It feels so weird and confusing when we agreed that the sex is great, the friendship is great, everything is great, but she couldn’t bring herself back from doubt or bring herself to feel feelings of true love and commitment again. 

Any advice on how to move forward, I want to fill this emptiness with something, instinct says physical connection but I don’t know what else. ",1,1736527678.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Obviously, the simplest one would be to use distilled water (perhaps with some distilled vinegar) and shake. However, as usual I like the more complicated stuff and decided to pursue something like this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsa7swKRCw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsa7swKRCw)

Basically a small loop to let it run for a while and collect gunk inside the coffee filter. Thus, I've purchased this small pump off of ebay: [https://www.amazon.de/dp/B092CSTKBP?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_fed\_asin\_title](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B092CSTKBP?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)

It says it has two nozzles:

    Multifunctional and 2 nozzles: Equipped with 2 nozzles, one with 1/3 inch diameter, the other with 1/2 inch diameter, offers different water flow effects.

And this is where my confusion starts, as I don't know what sort of tube and compression fitting to get to match that diameter.

1/3 inch diameter translates to: 8.4666666667 mm

1/2 inch dimeter translates to: 12.7 mm

Regarding the hose, I found some on aliexpress that are 8mm ID and 10mm OD. Would that 8mm fit the 1/3 inch nozzle?

I also looked at the alpha cool site and they have a fitting that says 10/8mm (https://shop.alphacool.com/en/shop/fittings/tube-connections/108mm/ans-10/8mm-8x1mm-screw-on-nozzle-g1/4), but I'm not sure if 8mm is the inner or the outer diameter. According to this guide https://www.ekwb.com/blog/fittings-and-tubing-guide/ the first number if the ID and the second one the OD but that cannot be as 10mm > 8mm. I am a bit confused.

I'd greatly appreciate some help on what fittings (even if they're barb I guess?) I'd need to purchase along with the size of the tube (1/3"" or 1/2"") to be able to wire that loop, if possible at all.

PS. Most likely an overkill to flush that way but since I already got the the pump, coffee filter, perhaps worth giving it a shot

The subject line doesn’t make much sense but it will in a minute: I am in the process of launching a physical media store-slash-bookshop-slash-coffee bar in my hometown and am trying to raise funds by offloading large swaths of my extensive, and much-loved collection. But I need help assessing how much this stuff is worth! 

I am 100% complete (either Bluray, best format, or all) on many boutique lines: Code Red, Scorpion, Dark Force, Vinegar Syndrome (+ VSA, VSP, VSU, Peekarama/Melusine, and several OCN partners including AGFA), Severin, Blue Underground, Synapse, 88 Films Italian & Asia Collections, Shameless, Raro, Arrow Box Sets, Second Sight Box Sets, Indicator Box Sets, the list goes on. I would say I am mostly complete on box sets from every major boutique. I also have complete lines of more obscure labels like Wild East Entertainment, Mya, One 7, NoShame, and foreign labels like Plaion (ex-Koch), Explosive Media, Umbrella (Ozploitation), Imprint, etc.

(Yes, I am also Criterion complete, including laserdiscs, VHS tapes, and CDROM, but I am having a much harder time parting with that collection…)

So, back to the point of this post: I need to raise around $100K to cover startup costs for the store and I’m hoping my collection can help make a sizable dent in that number, but I haven’t the faintest idea how to accurately price these sets.

Help!

I’m currently at a Dunkin Donuts on 277 Linden Street in Wellesley, next to the Volkswagen dealership. Close to Linden Square, where there is the CVS, Roche Brothers. But anyway I happened to see Mike Vrabel along with his wife about maybe an hour ago, I guess they came in for coffee. I was thinking in my head if it was him, the face looked familiar from watching him play, when he coached the Titans. So I asked him if he was to make sure, so I asked him “Excuse me sir are you Mike Vrabel.” He said “Yes I’m”. I could not talk to him longer but I did ask him  “Are you going to be the next head coach” and he said something like “Give a couple days”, “ Lets see” or something like that. I think it’s more like wait and see at the moment. I wish I could talk to him longer about his playing days, time with the Patriots but I guess he along with his wife had to go. I also wanted to take a picture but did not want to seem like I was bothering them. I wish I could have because I would have posted the picture here too. I guess they had to go. When they say seeing an athlete in person or anyone is different than seeing on TV is true. Seeing him in person is definitely different from when I watched him on TV as a player or when he was the Titans coach. He is a pretty tall guy too or good height. He also has a blue Tesla, license plate with the 6x Super Bowl champions or something if I remember correctly. It’s crazy who you can bump into. ",0,1736527103.0,Patriots,30,0.26,False

## *Episode 1: Encounter With a New Foe; Amber Strikes!*

📝

Kyle was awoken not by his alarm but by his exuberant friend from childhood, Amber. “Rise and shine, Kyle! It’s time for our first day of Part II!” She flicked the light switch on. The room filled with the yellow glow of the aging incandescent bulb.

Kyle groaned and glanced at his phone. “It’s not even seven o’clock; let me sleep some more. Go away.” He rolled over to face away from Amber and pulled the covers over his head. Undeterred, Amber strode to the bed and forcefully whipped the covers away from him.

“Oh my God, Kyle, you sleep in boxer shorts? You almost just flashed me! At least you can’t get morning wood like other guys. It’s so gross when that happens!” Kyle tried to snatch the covers back, but Amber held them out of reach. “Nuh-uh. Time to get up, sleepy-head!”

Thoroughly defeated, Kyle rolled off the mattress and clonked his head on the edge of the bedside dresser. He grunted in pain and stumbled to his feet, holding his head in his hand. “Ow!” Amber hurried over to check whether he was okay, but he brushed her off then stumbled toward the door. “I gotta go take a whiz.”

Kyle sat down on the can and ran a hand over his forehead. Fortunately it had been a glancing blow. He finished his tinkle, flushed, then washed his hands at the sink. His hairless face stared back at him from the streak-covered and evidently hastily cleaned mirror. There was no sign of a bruise. He returned to his room, chased Amber out of it, then changed into his hoodie and sweatpants.

🚲 

Tommy was waiting for them outside the dorm building. “Hey lil’ buddy, I see Amber made sure you didn’t miss your alarm clock!” Kyle groaned. This was going to be one of those days. “You remember how to ride a bike, right? You didn’t forget that over the summer?” Kyle nodded. “Great. I’m gonna beat both of you to the lecture hall!”

“Hey, that’s not fair! You have a biological advantage over us!” protested Amber. Kyle dragged himself to the bicycle racks and tried to work a key into the padlock. “Kyle, it’s pretty early still. We could grab coffee on the way. Do you wanna do that?” Kyle grunted affirmatively as he worked his bicycle free of the tangled mass of frames and wheels.

Kyle and Amber watched as Tommy sped away, impossibly fast. “Do you think he knows that he won’t get any bonus marks for arriving early?” asked Kyle, to which Amber giggled. “Let’s go get that coffee. I really need it.” They walked through the earthy brick arch of the Barton side gate, their bicycle wheels periodically rearing up as they crossed each limestone flag. They checked for traffic, pedaled out onto the road, rode a short distance south, then turned east just before reaching Robinson.

It was a pleasant autumn morning, cool but not so cold that a brisk cycle wouldn’t warm them. A light breeze rustled the green and yellow leaves of the trees on either side of the path, a few of which were on the verge of turning orange. Blackbird and thrush songs rang out from hidden places. A few other students could be seen cycling, some returning from early morning rowing practice, others no doubt nursing hangovers. Two townies who had been jogging together stopped to provide directions to a lost fresher. Rays of sunlight crept between the foliage. They crossed the Garret Hostel Lane footbridge over the Cam, then carefully navigated the narrow streets and passageways to reach the burned umber of bumpy, sett-paved, jaw-shaking Trinity Street.

🚲 

They made their way to the little coffee shop on King’s Parade, which commanded a marvelous view of the chapel. It was quiet now, but they both knew it would be bustling later in the day, when the picturesque street filled with tourists. Kyle sipped on his mocha while Amber nursed her latte. “How are you holding up?” she asked quietly, concern evident in her voice. “It can’t have been easy, making that decision.”

Kyle didn’t answer immediately, instead rotating the paper coffee cup in his hands as he considered his response. “It’s like giving up on a dream,” he said. He sighed, then took another mouthful of mocha. “I realized that, fundamentally, it wasn’t me. I hoped I could fake it until I made it, and I got really good at faking it, but it never felt real.” He looked out of the window and saw the town beginning to wake: more and more cyclists passed by, a porter opened the main entrance to King’s, and a van made a delivery to a nearby overpriced confectioner.

Amber placed her hands around his. “I want you to know that I respect you immensely, Kyle. I respected your decision then and I respect your decision now. It doesn’t change our friendship.” A small, grateful smile drew itself on Kyle’s face as he gave a slight nod in appreciation.

As they left the shop, a distracted Kyle accidentally bumped into a woman who had been too focused on the pavement to notice her surroundings. They both went sprawling to the ground. “Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry,” said Kyle. “Are you hurt?”

“Just a little bump—” she smiled, before looking at Kyle, frowning, and pausing mid-sentence. “Um, I gotta go!” She dashed off in the opposite direction to the one in which she had originally been traveling.

“What was all that about?” Amber asked. Kyle shook his head. He knew, and his sulky expression continued all along Trumpington Street.

🚲 

Amber and Kyle each acquired a copy of the lecture notes from the pile that had been set up outside the theater, then looked around for Tommy. They found him sitting next to the woman with whom Kyle had collided earlier. Amber sat next to Tommy on the opposite side, and Kyle in turn sat next to Amber. Tommy introduced the woman as Rae, who had transferred to Jesus from Keele University for her final year.

“It’s nice to meet both of you,” said Rae, before recognizing Kyle. “Uh—sorry, this is rude of me, but what are your pronouns?” Kyle grimaced internally before telling her that he used he/him pronouns. “Right. Gotcha. Thanks!” She made a brief note on her phone. Kyle frowned; he’d hoped for at least one day without this happening.

The lecturer arrived and introduced herself as Professor Ato. She would be teaching them the mathematical principles of bipedal locomotion. Kyle couldn’t focus and let his mind drift, knowing that he’d be able to review the notes later. He thought back to the summer that had seemed to stretch out endlessly, to the countless evenings spent ruminating between long days at his internship, to the decision—made eventually in September—to return to his old life.

🚲 

Amber apologized that she wouldn’t be able to join the other two for lunch, citing JCR business. “You’re still doing that stuff? I can’t believe you’re not tired of it yet,” Tommy said while grinning. Amber returned the grin, shrugged, and exited the building. Tommy and Kyle added their names to the supervision sign-up sheet.

“So, Kyle… want to try grabbing lunch at Selwyn? I heard their food is way better than ours. Afterwards we could hit up the college gym. They did a refurb over the summer. I thought you might want to bulk up since, you know, you’re… kind of thin in the shoulders. You could use some upper body development.”

He knew Tommy was trying to help, even though the comment about his body stung. “Sure, sounds good. Cycling’s great cardio, but you’re right: I could do with bulking up a bit.” They cycled west along Sidgwick Avenue to the various humanities faculties of the Sidgwick Site, dodging parked cars and tree roots that had breached the road surface. Eventually finding two open spots amidst racks littered with ocher leaves, they chained up their bicycles and made their way through a back gate to the Selwyn gardens, through which winding paths showcased patches of colorful flowers interspersed with green spaces and oak benches. Several students were picnicking on the grass, eating sandwiches and drinking Pimm’s. “This is really pretty. I can’t believe nobody told me about this place.”

“Yeah, I guess it’s a bit of a hidden gem. I’m glad I took my hay fever tablets, though! Anyway, we should hurry up: if we wait too long then the queue will be huge. All the Sidgwick Site students come here these days.” They made their way to the main court and up the steps to the hall. A queue had already formed. “My brother applied here,” Tommy said while they waited. “He got put into the pool, though. Churchill made him an offer, but he ended up going to MIT instead.”

“How’s he finding it over there?” Kyle grabbed two trays and handed one to Tommy.

“Oh, he loves it. He says everything is bigger in America, and they don’t have all the stuffy traditions that we do here. Way better on LGBT stuff too—” Tommy realized the sudden presence of his foot in his mouth. “Oops. Sorry, Kyle. I know things aren’t great for you here.”

“It’s okay,” said Kyle. “Hardly your fault. Besides, maybe I can apply to do a master’s in Canada next year.” They reached the first station and ordered their food, resuming their conversation after they were seated. Tommy remarked that the food was better than what Barton usually served, even for formals. Kyle would have agreed, but he was busy running over potential plans for his future. After finishing they reclaimed their bicycles, then made their way to their college’s gym, which for reasons neither of them could fathom was located next to Wolfson.

🚲 

In truth, it was more a garage than a gym. There were two benches, a squat rack, and various free weights. Kyle picked out a small pair of dumbbells and ran through a simple sequence of bicep curls, tricep curls, and bent over rows. “Well done,” said Tommy, who had completed his own routine of deadlifts, bench presses, military presses, and squats. “Take it nice and easy at first. You’re gonna feel sore in the morning, though.”

“Yeah, but I feel kind of pathetic. I’m glad nobody else was here to see this.” Kyle wanted to continue feeling sorry for himself, but the sight of Tommy’s sweat-drenched tank top clinging to his torso while his shoulders and arms glistened was distracting him.

“Hey man, you’re not pathetic. You’re one of the most courageous guys I know.” Tommy gave him a friendly slap on the back. “Most guys in your situation? They’d give up. You’re out here doing your best. And if you keep at it, then in six months’ time you’ll have made so much progress that nobody will care where you started.”

Kyle looked up at Tommy, his eyes damp. “Thanks, Tommy. That means a lot to me.”

“Any time, bro. Now let’s go shower.”

🚲 

“So, son, how was your first day back?” came his father’s voice through the phone loudspeaker. Kyle was pacing back and forth in his room, not replying immediately. “Did something happen?” sounded with a note of concern.

“People know, dad. Even strangers. I met a transfer student today, and I think she thinks I’m a trender in the other direction.” He let out a sigh of frustration as he slumped into his chair.

His father hesitated before replying. “Kyle, you have to realize that you’re not like other men any more, after the choices you made. You’re… you’re always going to struggle now, with the way you’re built. You need to be careful and stay safe.”

Kyle’s shoulders sagged. “I know that, dad. I just hoped I could get through one day without getting stared at or asked my pronouns. You’d think that my height, my haircut, and my clothes would give a strong enough hint.”

His mother’s voice came through faintly over the line, probably from another room in his parents’ house. “Honey? Could you help me scratch an itch between my legs? I can’t seem to get it myself.” Kyle tried to erase the last few seconds of his memory while his father fabricated an excuse to cut the call.

Kyle staggered from the chair to the bed and flopped down on the soft mattress. He knew his parents were trying to be supportive, but his dad always seemed to focus on the downside of every situation. He lay there for a few minutes, letting the tension flow out of his muscles. They’d no doubt be sore tomorrow after his first workout in months.

Amber knocked on his door. “Hey, Kyle? Tommy and I are going to get pizzas from Sainsbury’s. They’ll cook them for us. We thought we could maybe bring them back and eat them in the college gardens since the weather’s nice. Wanna come along?”

Pizza sounded delightful to Kyle right about then. “Sure! Let me grab my things.”

At a time when most people feel constantly distracted by technology and barraged by the news, authenticity and straightforward honesty are paramount. There’s something about the music of The Po’ Ramblin’ Boys that cuts right through the noise of the world and speaks plainly to the soul. Formed in the Smoky Mountains, The Po’ Ramblin’ Boys are at once exactly what you would expect and not at all what you would expect from a tattooed East Tennessee Bluegrass outfit. No strangers to hard work, the 2018 IBMA Emerging Artists of the Year are as much at home riding in their 1965 GM Tour bus as they are crawling underneath to fix it when it needs maintenance. But they take pride in being ambassadors of their genre, and the group has brought their music from rural bluegrass festival stages to the rock clubs of Europe, with stunning results. Doors open at 6:00 PM and the music starts at 7:00 PM.

1hy8dad,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1hy8dad/bpd_f_meets_avoidant_m_and_its_pure_selfharm/,Bpd (f) meets avoidant (m) and it's pure self-harm ,"I've meet L. almost 8 months ago at work.

He's very badly avoidant from a difficult childhood (got beaten up as a child, parents alcoholics, not present at all) and depressive, very lonely despite having a lot of friends. He goes out a lot, when he does takes a lot of drugs, but says he kinda has his life together now (he stopped drinking, has a stable job, is doing a lot of sports and eats healthy). He's an amazing person, smart, caring, incredibly funny. I fell in love with his soul and heart the moment I met him.

I have bpd, was diagnosed about 5 years ago and again this year. I was married but decided to leave my partner. While trying to fix things with my ex again, I met L., felt an intense connection and took it as a sign to break things off again. I'm very impulsive and I get attached AND obsessed very, very quickly.

We started really strong, like the beginning of a proper real love story, two magnets. Proper euphoria. Those weeks were so full of joy. But then he completely backed off, from one day to the other, the minute I expressed my feelings. I think it was out of fear. This caused me one of the biggest crisis I ever had in front of a person (tense/locked body, incapacity to move, shaking my head, no emotions for 3 hours straight) and started a cycle of self-harm (hitting myself in the face because I am useless and I am a nobody and I don't want to exist anymore, devalorisation, self-hatred for not being able to keep him). I properly felt like I wanted to die to not feel this anymore. 

He was there and held me the whole night. I felt for the first time than someone was not afraid of this. That he could understand. 

Rather than leaving with my pride and going on with our life, we stayed in this weird relationship.

Sadly, I can't cut things off because I still somehow believe our relationship is special and I'm addicted to his constant attention, and he's not able to cut if off completely because he needs my attention and thrives on my love. I'm completely dissociating from my needs in his presence because he acts like everything is fine 99% of the time.

For me, he's my favorite person. All i want is to be around him, it's the only place I feel calm and safe. It just stops the noise in my head. I live for these moments when we're just together, talking, hugging, cuddling, laughing and being goofy. Then there are long days and weekends where I have no idea what he does or where he's at.

I couldn't take this rejection (and the ones which follows) for an answer and started to cope in any way possible (alcohol, denial, just emotion suppression). I acted like these rejections never happened and continued to text him and give him attention without expressing my needs. Fact is, I'm in love with him, and he ""cannot and will not feel anything for me"".

I told him I'm falling in love with him, and he said ""no you aren't"". He's diminishing my feelings.  
He asked me if I had feelings for him and I said yes. He knows what I feel.  
He asked me (too) many times if I would give him a baby and i said yes. I genuinely feel like I could do that with him. It's so fucking weird because I am a smart woman, I don't make stupid decisions like this, I know this is crazy, but with him nothing seems too crazy.

He is not able to have a proper conversation with me about this. I'm too afraid to lose him so I also don't talk about it. Sometimes it hurts me so much that I just cry next to him and he asks me what it's about like if he doesn't know exactly that it's because of us. There's an elephant in the room and no one wants to see it. I'm so triggered by his presence at work that I sometimes need to buy alcohol at 9 am to be able to cope. I can't avoid him, the minute he asks me to come near him I do it. The few conversations we had about this ended up with me crying on the sidewalk, telling him to leave me alone and never talk to me again, and him saying he wont have feelings, ok bye, like if he was completely indifferent to it. I see his face being super close and emotionless. We've had that conversation 5 or 6 times. I always end up texting back or we meet at work again and are too happy to reconnect.

He genuinely wants to see me and hang out with me, although I can see that he tries to resist the urge to touch me or be closer. He texts me everyday. If I'm late at the office he's like ""where u at"" and asks me to come work with him in a small room. He caresses me, my hair, smells me, compliments me. He needs me super close. He's very sweet with me. He told me once ""but you will be my wife, you should know that"", and ""I don't want you to look at any other man like that"".

He also tells me he wants to date to find the love of his life. That he's so lonely and needs to find the perfect girl. He tells me about it with no filters knowing that I have feelings for him (I say ""don't say that around me"" and feel my heart sink in my chest). I know he sees other girls sometimes but he doesn't seem to like anyone. I just think he has this image of love in his head which is impossible to achieve and will probably never be able to love. What saves me from complete heart break is to think that he will probably never find love because of the way it triggers him.

Last time he showed me the place he wants to get married at. Many pictures. And concluded ""I'll never get married anyways"". Sometimes he's so sad it breaks my heart.

Sometimes I feel so terrible about being rejected but like an addiction to him at the same time. I don't really understand if what we have is real, if I invent everything, if he cares for real or if he's just bored. If he's avoidant or toxic. If he's a gift or a curse.

We're colleagues, we're friends, we're dating but ""not like that"". I slept at his place more times that I can count, often without any sex, just hugging each other really strong to sleep. We don't kiss often but we sometimes do. When we watch a movie we're skin on skin. When we kiss and have sex it's super sensual and good. We have excellent chemistry. I've met his friends, he's really comfortable with that, probably because ""i'm not the one"".

He never comes to my place anymore, as if it was too ""couply"" for him. We meet either at work, either at his, either at the coffee down the street. We talk a lot about doing other things together (going to the spa, going traveling, we almost went to Paris, going to the theater, but it feels like it's more for the thrill to imagine it's possible that to actually make it happen). It's like he's constantly playing with the idea of having me as a girlfriend but hates that very idea at the same time, like he is properly allergic to it. I'm so afraid to lose him that I never suggest anything that could make it seem like we are in a relationship.

When we're together I really see him lighten up. He has depression and tells me regularly he wants to die or not wake up or jump under a bus. But around me he's chatty, he dances, he sings, he's calm, he can focus. I see that I do him good. Outside of his avoidant behavior, he is super kind to me, cares for me, cooks for me, gives me warm clothes, find little things he wants to give me, I know he thinks about me a lot because he tells me constantly ""oh look, you would have loved that"". He knows me and really sees me for who I am, he gives me compliments like you're the smartest girl I've met, you have the best taste in music we have nice conversations about anything. We have so much in common. He understands my nerdiness and so do I his. He said his mum would love me so much. He has a tattoo of a sagittarius on his leg and said ""its for all the sagittarius women in his life"", which are me, and his mum.

It's been a roller coaster, with a repeating pattern: we build sexual tension, we get very close, we spend a lot of time with each other, we get touchy and romantic, he asks me to come over, we sleep in each other arms, we have sex or not in the morning, then he says this won't happen ever again, he takes distance because he can't deal with my emotions, saying he's only hurting me. Then a week passes, and the cycle starts again.

When we're together we are glued to each other.

I'm often the only girl he sees. He's told me that a lot. ""You're the only girl who comes here"". ""Time with you is not trash"". ""You make my life better"". That's as far as he can go in terms of admitting we are close.

He's like self harm for me.

I can't date anyone else, I've tried and all I think about is him.

I don't know what to do. I can't deal with the idea of rejecting him myself. I can't block him.",1,1736526687.0,BorderlinePDisorder,3,1.0,False
1hy8cvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hy8cvg/the_lavender_room_part_ii/,The Lavender Room Part II,"Part one [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1htk3sm/the_lavender_room_part_i/).

I had no idea how long it had been since I had started working at the Lavender room. What I did know however, was that I had been drinking far too much. The revelation came on a day when I hadn't taken a shot before leaving my room for my shift dealing cards to the regulars. Occasionally a new face would come through the doors and I would want to tell them to run, to put as much distance between them and the building and themselves as they could, but my throat seemed to seal up, and my lips would freeze in a professional smile.

It didn't matter that my cheeks were tired and sore, the muscles of my face refused to relax. I also found that I was unable to say anything that was not related to whatever game I was working that night as long as I was on the clock. When iit was my day off, I seemed to have more free will but still found myself unable to say anything negative about the place. I also had no desire to leave. I began to wonder if everyone who lived and worked at the place had the same issues that I was having. I got an opportunity a few days later while I was sitting at my usual table after work.

I spotted one of my co-workers at the bar. She was a rather attractive middle-aged woman with red hair, named Nadine. Her voice still held a trace of her original Irish accent though it had definitely been weathered by her time in America.

“How are you tonight?” I asked, taking a seat next to her.

“I can't really complain, how about you?” she replied, turning her attention from me to her drink as it arrived.

My food arrived along with my own beverage.

'It can wait.' I thought, though my stomach rumbled as the aroma of the food wafted into my nostrils.

“I'm actually curious. Have you ever noticed the effect having negative thoughts about this place has on your mind and body?” I blurted, though I had intended to be more subtle about it, my brain took advantage of the fact it wasn't being forced to stifle itself.

“Oh, that. It gets less painful over time.” she assured me with a faint smile.

I wondered for a moment if that expression was genuine or not.

“That's good to know, I guess.” I admitted, and got the sense that I wouldn't get anywhere if I pushed the older woman any further on the topic.

I excused myself back to my own table and finally gave in to my thirst and hunger. I went back to my room, and laid down on the bed. The next day was my day off, and as I laid there, staring at the ceiling, I began to conceive of an experiment that I decided I would carry out the next day. I set an alarm for just after dawn and tried to get some sleep. I tossed and turned, barely dozing until the noise shook me awake for the final time. I rose from the soft mattress and shaved my face, then took a long, hot shower. Once I got dressed, I headed down to breakfast.

I made my usual order, and ate quickly. Starting for the door as soon as I finished. Employees ate for free so I didn't even have to stop at the counter in front of the place. As I stepped out the door, I heard someone call my name. I turned back, stepping aside.

“Where are you going?” Mark, the slick haired manager I had met upon my first visit to this place enquired, hurrying down the hall toward me. His smile didn't match the urgency of his pace.

“I need to pick up some essentials. Is that a problem?” there was no malice behind the question, my voice calm and neutral.

“Not at all. I'm just concerned about you.” the other man replied.

“I'm fine.” I tried to soothe him, and continued on my earlier path through the door before he could say anything further.

I stepped away from the door and hurried to my car. I hadn't been lying, and my first stop was the store. Once I got those items, my experiment officially began. I went to a coffee shop first, settling in at a window seat to enjoy my first drink. I ordered a second beverage to go before I stepped back onto the street. I had only been gone almost an hour and I could already feel the desire to return scratching at the surface of my brain. I went to a park nearby instead, finding a seat on a bench near a bike path. I sipped the hot, vanilla flavored coffee as I watched other people enjoying the area.

A woman jogged along the path, and we exchanged a quick nod as she passed me by. The longer I sat there, the more intense the feeling I needed to get back 'home' became. I waited until I began to develop a slight headache, the pain starting like the jabbing of a needle just behind my left eye. I began to feel hot, as if I had a fever. I went back to my car and started back toward the less busy part of town, and the nearer I got, the more the negative feelings began to fade away. I decided I would push a little harder the next day even as I stepped through the door, into the club.

It was as if I had never felt ill at all. My stomach even rumbled, reminding me that I hadn't eaten since breakfast. I wondered for a moment if that was why I had been feeling strange earlier, my mind at war with itself. Half wanted to blame the Lavender Room itself for the way I had felt. The other half dismissed that thought as ridiculous. It was just a building, after all. There had to be something more to it. The thoughts faded away as the day went on and eventually I made my way back to my private room, putting away my things and setting an alarm.

I spent a little bit of time dancing with strangers at the nightclub, having been unable to sleep so early in the evening. I also took a few shots of whiskey because it was free for employees, just as our meals were. I eventually returned to my room, but still spent hours staring at the ceiling in total darkness for hours. When I did fall asleep, I was plagued with very strange dreams about being lost and homeless, adrift in the world. No one seemed to see or hear me, even when I began to bleed. Bright red blood ran from every one of my pores.

I woke as the clock screamed into the silence and darkness. I sat up and hurried through my shower and getting dressed. I tried to leave without being noticed by most of my co-workers, and it seemed to work as I made it outside without being accosted that time. I went to breakfast and spent A little longer than I needed, lingering long enough to drink an extra cup of coffee before getting back into my car. On a whim, I navigated my way onto the freeway. As I suspected as I got further out of town I began to feel unwell.

I got off the road at the next available exit, and made my way back to the city. I didn't return to the Lavender room, yet however, exercising what little bit of free will that still remained mine to enjoy. I ate lunch at the same diner I had visited the day before, rushing to the toilet to purge the food I had just eaten moments after paying my bill. I knew I had to return to the place I had to be living and working, and so I did.

I barely made it into the door before I collapsed into unconsciousness. I woke in my room, stripped to my waste and with cool cloths pressed over the exposed parts of my body. I sat up, removing the rags, still feeling somewhat dazed and weak. Nadine was in my living area.

“You gave us quite a fright, my friend.” she said when she heard my bedroom door open.

“I'm sorry about that, but what exactly just happened to me?” I asked, unable to contain my curiosity.

“I don't think that I am at liberty to tell you.” she replied.

I stared at the woman for a long time, and for a moment, I thought I saw a flicker of regret and even pity in her eyes. The look was quickly replaced by her usual mask of cool indifference. I wanted to prod, but instead I cleared my throat.

“I appreciate you helping me, but you can leave now. I feel better.” I told her, though I was lying.

I still felt very weak as I watched the woman go, and then moved to my bedroom to pull on a new shirt. I decided that isolating myself was a bad idea after sitting around in silence until my strength began to return. As I made my way up the stairs, I also made up my mind that I would confront Matt and get some real answers, since Nadine didn't seem interested in enlightening me. I went to his office first, but the lights inside were dark, and I got no response when I knocked anyway. I checked the club on the top floor, and there were some familiar faces, but not the one I was looking for.

I ended up at the bar, where I ordered a soda instead of alcohol. As I sipped my beverage, I couldn't resist the urge when the bartender approached me again, and spoke up.

“Have you seen Matt today?” I asked.

Joe, the man slinging drinks gave a shake of his head.

“I think it's one of his days off, actually.” he said after a moment.

I felt a flash of frustration.

“Can you call my room if he comes in, please?” I requested.

He nodded, and I finished my drink, but didn't linger afterward. Instead, I returned to my room, surfing through the channels, waiting for the man behind the bar to call me. He didn't and when I emerged onto the first floor, he had been replaced behind the counter. I felt defeated as I ordered dinner and ate my meal alone as I usually did. This time, I didn't go back to my room, heading down to the gambling parlor instead. I nodded to one of the regulars as I approached the cage, exchanging some cash for chips.

I approached the roulette table, where Nadine stood, and took a seat. Her eyes skimmed over me briefly.

“Are you here to play or to ask me more questions that I can't answer?” she greeted me coldly.

Instead of speaking, I placed a chip on seven red. She let the ball roll and to my surprise, it landed in the same slot that I had bet on. I moved my initial bet along with my winnings to thirteen black, and once again that was where the little sphere landed. That made me think about the second time I had visited the place. The fact that I won that night had brought me back. Just as I began to think I was on to something, I lost. Nadine smiled at me.

“Another game?” she prodded.

I stood up and shook my head, retreating to my room. I watched T.V. For a while longer, pouring myself a shot of tequila while I flipped through the channels. My landline phone rang, which surprised me. I stood and walked to it, lifting the old-fashioned, corded handset from the cradle.

“Hello?” the word left my lips after a moment.

“This is Avery, at the bar. I was told to call you when Matt returned.” the semi-familiar female voice informed me.

“Where is he?” I enquired in return.

“On his way to his office.” she answered, sounding confused and more than a little irritated.

“Thank you. I'll be right up.” I told her, and then hung up before she could speak up again.

I hurried from my room and up the stairs, finding my way into the corridor for the second time that day. This time, the lights in the office were glowing behind the tightly closed blinds as I approached the manager's door. I knocked on the glass panel in the door and almost immediately heard shuffling noises behind it before the slick-haired man's words penetrated the door.

“One minute, please.” he called.

The door unlocked and opened moments later, and I stepped inside the room before he could say anything else.

“What is this place?” I demanded.

“What do you mean? It's a multi-level club. One of the first of its kind...” he began.

“Bullshit.” I interjected, though my tone remained calm.

“I don't know what you're talking about.” he denied again.

“I want answers, Matt.” I said, making direct eye contact with the man.

That's when I saw it. He was afraid, but not of me. I sighed, feeling the anger that had fueled me since my sudden bout of illness begin to melt out of my muscles, my strength seeming to follow it, draining out through the bottom of my feet. I collapsed into a chair.

I felt defeated, and even felt tears stinging my eyes.

“You wouldn't tell me anything if you could.” I said, the feelings in my head rendering my voice quiet and weak.

“I can't.” he replied, his eyes darting from me to his door, as if someone could be listening right outside of it.

The frustration I had been feeling for the previous week returned.

“Who can?” I demanded.

“You know the answer to that. If you want the truth, you have to go to the source.” Matt answered, seemingly uncomfortable even disclosing that much.

I stood up and left without speaking again. I started to think about what he had said. The source. He had to have meant the other man I had met my first night there. The one who had claimed to be the owner. I tried to remember his face, but there was a blank spot where his features could have been. All I could mentally picture was his purple suit. Even his hair color escaped me. The more I thought about him, the more I began to feel ill again.

I gave up, once again resigning myself to my fate. The desire to escape gnawed at the back of my mind like a hungry rat.

Looking for restaurant, coffee shops good for remote working, and bar recommendations ideally in/near RiNo. I won’t have a car so anywhere walkable (from nyc ~30min walk is fine assuming there are sidewalks..?). I have no problem going to eat/having a drink or two solo. I’m also open to any and all ethnic food — just want it to be delicious. :) Mix of budget friendly and splurge options would be great!

Definitely willing to leave RiNo if anyone has additional recs for great museums or unique Denver attractions! …. and I know I’m missing out but I wouldn’t do any hikes solo, sooo unless there are hiking groups (for beginners) don’t bother recommending any.… lol.

Unfortunately I have come here many times in search for help, but everything I try to make things better seems to not work.

My husband is basically always unhappy and says it’s my fault because I’m always “moppy” and talk too quietly and with a sad tone. He says I never want to spend time with him, I’m always tired, we never have sex and I’m never cute and nice. That he would prefer to be with a young nice happy girl instead of me and he is only with me because we have a son. 

I am responsible for everything that is not work outside the home related (meaning he works(from home) and I do the rest). He has never changed one diaper because his hands have rashes when he washes his hands often. I mow the lawn, take the trash out, go to college, bathe dog, care for son, make food, dishes, laundry, coffee for him, get him dressed for work meetings when I’m home, clean up after him, if something breaks either I fix or I call someone, he pays. 
I understand that he has pressure from work and that without his income things would be tough but even before we had a son, I worked part time and paid for a lot of stuff while he was home depressed and not working at all. He has a long history of depression because he had an accident and after that stopped working while recovering and never went back, it snowballed. His mom paid for his rent and living cost, I’m from another country and it wasn’t this bad while we were first dating and married. I think it’s my fault at least partially that I never said anything and just let things get to this point.
I’m trying to change on things he asks me to be different. I try to keep the kitchen counter cleared from clutter, I stay awake till 5-6 am some nights to watch a movie because he wants to watch movies in the middle of the night, I can’t do this every night, so if we go one week or even less without watching movies he complains that we NEVER watch movies, never spend time together. 

He complains he doesn’t spend time with our son, but after 5 min running around with our son he says he is tired and for our son to play with me. 

Our son has speech delay, so it’s obviously my fault that I don’t teach him how to speak. 

My MiL helps a lot but she is 71 and has heart issues, she also is working part time because some issues she needs to take care of. 
 
The situation with my husband has been snowballing, I’m not a night person so often I would fall asleep in middle of movies, he would be angry, now I try my best to stay awake , and have succeeded so far. 

, I pray every day for change, for me to be better for him to be less angry. I don’t have anyone to talk about this besides my mil and God. ",2,1736526257.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False

Normally, you'd think it'd be best to just kill the first enemy and spare the rest, right? Nope. Haven't tried myself, but I heard killing anything in the ruins means Dalv doesn't leave his home, so that's off the table. Spare everything in the ruins, do the Microfroggit encounter and get the golden pear.

I thought it would just be a case of 'Oh, just kill something in Snowdin since Dalv would already be planning on moving out', but then I realized something. From what it seems, he plans on moving into Snowdin. Having another attack right by the place he plans on calling home would definitely scare him back into the Ruins, especially since he's only just getting over the first incident from what it seems. Spare everything as you would in a pacifist run, help Slurpy and grab the golden coffee. Also give Martlet the best ratings on her report bc she deserves it. Buy all Mo's stuff too.

Now the Dunes/Mines were my other original pick, since you're far enough from Snowdin to not scare Dalv, Martlet's god knows where and you haven't met the other cast members, but I decided against it for reasons that'll make sense later. Not much to note here, just play as you would in a pacifist run. Make sure you go back for the golden cactus after confronting Starlo in the Wild East. Once again, make sure you buy Mo's stuff. Oh yeah also make sure the miner gets their hard hat back.

Now here's the part y'all may like. When you get to the Steamworks, ***kill Jandroid.*** It's the first enemy you run into, and I've seen a noticeable distain for it among the community, so now's your chance to vent your frustrations. Kill the first Jandroid, spare everything else. The only reason why I chose Jandroid over a random enemy in the Dunes or Mines is because they're living things, Jandroid is a mass produced robot. However sentient it may be, it does not have a family or anything like that, and it's easily replaceable. Ceroba might be disappointed, but it's much better than killing a fully organic being like a Dunebud. Just spare everything else after that, do the Macrofroggit fight, get the golden bandana and buy the last of Mo's stuff.

Congrats, you now have the most ethical neutral run you can do. Feel free to post any improvements/suggestions you have in mind! ~~My hyperfixation on this game is~~ *~~very~~* ~~obvious and~~ *~~very~~* ~~strong.~~",5,1736526135.0,UndertaleYellow,2,1.0,False

Does anyone know how I can fix this?",2,1736526102.0,reddithelp,1,1.0,False
1hy84ow,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1hy84ow/upset_with_long_line_at_post_office/,"Upset with long line at post office, septuagenarian with bad knee takes opportunity to praise God-Emperor when inspired by baby shower invites. Why.","I'm struggling to feel awake today. My 35yo ass stayed up until 3am working on a college assignment, took a nap, and then drove my HS and elementary schooler to the bus stop 2hrs apart so they wouldn't have to stand in the freezing wind. Also, our oldest (my step son) is getting surgery today so my mind is mostly on that and I'm kinda staring at my phone in case my husband calls. 

So, while I'm not exactly at peak ""me"" today, I still wanted to go to the post office to get pretty stamps for my best friend's baby shower invites. The line at my small post office was out the door but I really didn't mind just vibing and people watching. I was a little annoyed when a Boomer lady came up behind me and immediately engaged me in conversation but, I was polite and humored her. 

First she complained about the line and said she'd hurt her knee in a ski accident. I asked her if leaning on the big desk thing might help and she was like ""oh yeah, maybe."" Next, she complained she couldn't figure out who to make her $32.80 money order out to and asked me to see if I could figure it out. It was for our electricity supplier and the ""make payable to"" was right on her bill. Then she went back to complaining about how no one is working at the post office and said ""this is what happens when you overwork and underpay people!""

I warmed up to her a little after that because she expressed a sentiment I agree with. I said ""yeah, if only there was a way to fund the services we need. I guess I really don't need pretty stamps but I wanted to make these invites extra special- I'm so excited my best friend is finally having her first baby!"" I showed the boomer my pretty handmade invites and envelopes and she was very impressed. I thought I was having a normal interaction with someone who maybe doesn't get out much. 

Nope.

Idk why but I said ""I can't believe she's finally gonna be a mom! I'll have adult kids before hers hits kindergarten!"" And the boomer goes ""good thing her baby grow up in a world after Trump, when all this stuff is fixed!""

I just looked at her. 

In a very rude tone she says ""I'm sorry did I hurt your feelings."" And I replied in an equally shitty tone with: ""Yes, that's the problem. My feelings. Please stop talking to me. I don't need this today.""

Then she says ""I SAID sorry."" So I go: ma'm, that was the weirdest thing to say in response to a strangers excitement about a baby. And if you think Trump is going to fund the US Post Office you need to be in a home. Or go skiing again (that's how she hurt her knee- in the 80s). 

She finally stopped talking to me. I got my pretty stamps. I'm gonna go drink some $7 coffee and think about 20 years in the future when they will be so few and far between that it becomes a novelty to run in to random boomers.",243,1736526093.0,BoomersBeingFools,36,0.98,False

At a time when most people feel constantly distracted by technology and barraged by the news, authenticity and straightforward honesty are paramount. There’s something about the music of The Po’ Ramblin’ Boys that cuts right through the noise of the world and speaks plainly to the soul. Formed in the Smoky Mountains, The Po’ Ramblin’ Boys are at once exactly what you would expect and not at all what you would expect from a tattooed East Tennessee Bluegrass outfit. No strangers to hard work, the 2018 IBMA Emerging Artists of the Year are as much at home riding in their 1965 GM Tour bus as they are crawling underneath to fix it when it needs maintenance. But they take pride in being ambassadors of their genre, and the group has brought their music from rural bluegrass festival stages to the rock clubs of Europe, with stunning results. Doors open at 6:00 PM and the music starts at 7:00 PM.

1hy82yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/westchesterpa/comments/1hy82yh/roses_little_donuts/,Rose’s Little Donuts,"Hey everyone, I've seen [the post about our shop closing](https://www.reddit.com/r/westchesterpa/comments/1hxl4b4/theres_a_hex_in_wc_nothing_lasts_bring_back_bon/) ([and this related one](https://www.reddit.com/r/westchesterpa/comments/1hxuupa/what_things_other_than_restaurants_can_last_in/)) and thought about leaving a comment but figured I would do a quick summary here for anyone interested.

In 2022, Bon Bon closed and the building went up for sale. We had been thinking about opening a donut shop for almost a decade, and it seemed like the perfect location: right on the edge of the center of town, next to the courthouse, limited parking but easy to run in for a pickup order. We had the means to purchase it, so we decided to go for it.

We loved Bon Bon, and I ate there usually 2 times a week. Their app was great: I could tap Bonzilla, Apple Pay, and pick up the perfect lunch 10 minutes later. I know there are a few rumors on why Bon Bon closed: COVID killed it, owner burn out, etc. I don't have details on any of that, but what I do know is the building (built circa 1900) was falling apart due to water damage. Water would pour into the basement during every rainfall. The foundation was failing, all of the walls were moldy, subfloors rotting. We spent a year gutting and repairing the building, and resolving the water issues, before beginning the shop buildout in the Summer of 2023. The building is in great shape now and ready for the next 100 years.

Our ideas for a donut shop were:

1. Smaller donuts so you can enjoy one without regret after/cutting it up to share
2. Interesting/unique flavors that are always changing
3. Ready to go so you're not waiting
4. Great coffee/espresso

We had a vision of a product and experience that we wanted to bring to West Chester. We succeeded in seeing that vision through and we're proud of it, but not in making it sustainable.

It's impossible to know just how much business you're going to do before trying it. It was also difficult to predict daily/seasonal volume. We would have some weekends we expected to be busy and we'd end up overstaffed, or some random traditionally slow weekday we would be overwhelmed with sales. November and December were also unexpectedly slow. Our expenses in 2024 were ~15% over revenue, and we didn't pay ourselves. Our idea was always to have staff run the business, but the numbers don't work out long-term unless my partner was there every open hour with limited help. There's still a possibility for someone to take over the business and run it that way, and I think they would be successful.

Some comments said the donuts were priced too high. That's fair. We priced them at $2.50 which we thought would be reasonable for a single donut as a snack and discounted them with the box sizes, such that a 4-box was under $10 and a 9-box was under $20. Would we have sold 20% more if they were $2? 40% at 1.50? (realistically we would need to sell more than that factoring ingredient costs) I doubt it, but maybe.

We also thought we would do more coffee volume. I honestly think we have the best coffee in West Chester. But in retrospect, we don't have coffee in our name, and no seating, so nobody is going to consider us as a coffee shop.

All in all we are glad we tried it, enjoyed planning/designing/building/running the business, and are happy with how it turned out. We will be fine and are doing our best to make sure the employees will be too. Happy to answer any questions if people have them. Thanks! -Justin",67,1736525969.0,westchesterpa,9,0.99,False

Did one with a current law clerk (just graduated from my law school) at a firm I want for 2L summer - she was awesome, super  lovely convo, will be sending me her outlines for classes. Said she wants me to be at firm, blah blah. 

I have had contact with this firm before. Did two other coffee chats, attended a home for the holidays event, and they asked me to send my resume before for a separate inquiry into DEI stuff. Do I give her my resume or is it enough to send a thoughtful thank you/ email restating I look forward to keeping in touch? Never wanna be too presumptuous - and it was a super friendly vibe - but I never know the etiquette when they don't ask for a resume. ",2,1736525943.0,BigLawRecruiting,1,1.0,False

Hi there! I’m a cute, thicck, 33F looking for another romantic partner and connection - not looking for casual/FWBs/ONS etc. Ideally would like a LTR and a primary partner. 

I’m in grad school, enjoy films, music, board games, cooking & baking, exploring new restaurants and coffee shops. 

I’ve been told I’m easy to talk to and a good listener. I love learning about people’s passions and hobbies, so feel free to share. I myself identify as a yapper, so be prepared! I like frequent communication, but no need for constant. I’m funny, an extrovert with introvert qualities. I’m an eclectic mix of nerdy and bookish as well as girly and bubbly. 

I’m an outsidey person, as in I like sipping tea or cocktails on a patio and going for walks. Not so much a full on outdoorsy person. I love to travel! Not opposed to booking a last minute flight and exploring. 

I’m a touch person. Cuddles, snuggles, hugs and kisses, hand holding, always in contact is my thing. I realize it’s not for everyone, but touch is important to me. 

I currently have one partner right now. We practice parallel poly. 

Ideally would like to meet irl 1-2 times a week. I’m located between Cleveland and Akron in NE Ohio. If anything here has caught your attention, send me a message and a picture and let’s chat! Will share pics over DMs!",2,1736525886.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

Zarówno Intel, jak i AMD mają bowiem swoją własną, od dawna stosowaną, spójną strukturę nazw, która pozwala szybko i łatwo odróżnić od siebie poszczególne modele, podkreślając przy okazji ich nominalną wydajność. Nie każdy jednak przez ostatnie lata musiał śledzić zmian na rynku procesorów. Dla tych osób zrozumienie oznaczeń może być sporym wyzwaniem.

Przydatna może więc okazać się w aktualna ściągawka dotycząca nazewnictwa procesorów Intel i AMD. Szczególnie teraz, gdy wiele osób może zdecydować się na modernizację posiadanego sprzętu bądź też na zakup całkowicie nowego komputera. Impulsem do takich zakupów mogą okazać się zarówno dynamicznie zachodzące zmiany na rynku procesorów (AI, zaawansowane procesy produkcyjne i nowe funkcje), jak i nadchodzący wielkimi krokami kres wsparcia Windows 10, który ma nastąpić już 14 października 2025 roku. Warto wiedzieć bowiem, że Windows 11, prócz płyty głównej z TPM 2.0, wymaga też procesorów Intel Core minimum 8 generacji (Coffee Lake) bądź ten AMD Ryzen od serii 2000 (Zen+) w górę.

Wciąż nie wiecie o jakie procesory chodzi? To tym bardziej zachęcamy do zajrzenia do naszego poradnika „[Jakie są oznaczenia procesorów Intel i AMD?](https://www.komputronik.pl/informacje/oznaczenia-procesorow-intel-amd?utm_source=reddit.com&utm_medium=referral)”.

I have a unique opportunity as I have a piece of property located on a very busy intersection. I am currently thinking about putting a coffee shop there. It’s in a high income town and there is a ton of traffic. I’m putting the business plan together and it seems like a no brainer but there’s obviously things I’m going to encounter that I didn’t account for. Is there anyone on this sub that is running or has run a local coffee shop that might be able to give me some advice on things that may play a bigger factor than I’m anticipating.

1hy810u,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1hy810u/think_carefully_before_making_the_switch_from/,Think carefully before making the switch from agency to in-house,"Not enough people talk about this which is going from working in an agency to going in-house: The boredom, pressure and lack of support.

I started my career in an amazing agency where I never had to enter my hours, the culture was amazing and the people even more. My boss really taught me everything about Google ads and was really patient as this was my first experience. The agency where I worked specialized in a very specific niche of client and I decided to leave after a year because after a while it got redundant and I wanted to learn more.  
  
Well… I’ve accepted an in-house position and it is probably one of the worst job I've had. My manager is very sweet, but the marketing department is a team of 2. She is very knowledgable when it comes to PPC, but I hate not having colleagues to bounce ideas with, to discuss about the account and things of that nature. They aren’t increasing their budget, aren’t diversifying their marketing effort but the expectations are so high. Not to mention, that the company where I work now doesn’t even invest in their culture. In my old agency they really invested in making sure the employees were happy with regular events, snacks etc. Now, the few times I have to go in the office, there’s not even milk for my coffee. More than 90% of the office works from home, and although I get to benefit from this flexibility that’s not the type of environment I want to work in. I also feel like I self-sabotaged because my initial goal was to expand my knowledge outside of Google ads, but here I am doing exclusively SEM…..but in-house. I’m at a point where I am pretty much looking for another opportunity because I am uninterested in doing this much longer. At this point, should I go back to an agency or find a better in-house position? I wonder if more agencies where you don’t have to put in your hours exist….

I’m sharing this because we often hear great stories about people who made the switch, but this is not one of them. I think for the people who are looking to go in-house asking about the culture, and the size of their marketing team is important, especially if you are still early in your career.",1,1736525828.0,marketing,3,0.6,False
