Col Dubois watched the progress of her Marine boarding parties with a mix of suspicion and disbelief. Resistance seemed to have collapsed after *Achilles* rammed the alien vessel, and something didn’t feel right. After such tenacious resistance, for the aliens to just give up seemed out of character. *Maybe it’s not out of character,* Dubois thought. *Maybe their ship is more damaged than it looks, or maybe they suffered a lot of casualties in the collision*. The problem with the casualty theory was the boarding parties weren’t finding very many alien bodies. All the passages were empty, save a few random aliens manning control stations periodically through the passages. Those aliens didn’t try to fight, didn’t even acknowledge the Marines presence. In one instance, the Marines had passed right by the alien and it hadn’t reacted. 



“Where did they all go,” Dubois wondered aloud.



“Probably to the planet,” Major Jameson replied, sipping at his tea.



“All of them?” Dubois was skeptical.



“The Navy has tracked over ten thousand objects leaving the alien vessel and dropping toward Crescent 3,” Jameson replied. “Not all of them made it.”



*Ten thousand… that would be close to the complement of a battlecruiser, wouldn’t it?* Dubois pursed her lips and turned to the holographic tactical map of the alien vessel. Most of her teams were moving along the outer hull, traveling along corridors that seemed to run the length of the vessel. A few teams were pushing towards the middle of the alien vessel, guided by Marine officers back here in the Combat Center. These teams weren’t finding anything either, not even aliens moving to evacuate. It just didn’t make sense…



“Contact!” The voice of Captain Frank came over the loudspeakers. “Let ‘em have it!”



Dubois searched the monitors and found Captain Frank’s video feed. A group of wasp-like aliens were arrayed in front of Frank and his five Marines, gnashing their mandibles and moving forward towards the intruders. Behind them, shapes moved in the darkness of a large room. Automatic systems dampened the sound of the weapons as Frank’s team opened up with all five machineguns. The screeches of wounded bugs filled the comms, and Dubois watched as Frank and his men were forced back into the corridor.



“I think we found the aliens,” Jameson said quietly.



Dubois nodded, checking the tactical map. “Can we get any other teams down there?” She asked the Marine Combat Coordinator.



“I can try,” he replied. “But we don’t know where the corridors are until a team goes through them.”



“Do your best,” Dubois ordered, returning her gaze to Captain Frank and his firefight.



Captain Frank and his men were holding their own, now that they had pulled back into the corridor where they could bottleneck the aliens. On the tactical map, Dubois could see a team of reinforcements coming up behind with more ammunition. Another Marine team leader shouted an expletive, and Dubois searched the screens. She found the other team fairly quickly, and the reason for the Marine’s consternation. On the screen, the Marines' helmet-mounted lights showed an enormous alien, easily three times the size of the warriors they had been fighting earlier. Clustered around it were dozens of the smaller, wingless aliens as well as a dozen wasp-like aliens. The warrior aliens were moving to engage the Marines, while the other aliens milled around the feet of the large alien. The image darkened as the Marines were forced back into the corridor, the warriors using their front legs to shield their heads from the concentrated fire of the Marines’ automatic weapons. It wasn’t wholly effective, and Dubois saw two alien warriors fall before the Marines were pushed back to the point the camera could no longer show what was happening in the large room.



“You know,” Jameson commented coolly. “If these aliens were like wasps, I’d say we just found a queen in the center of the hive.”



Dubois wondered why she hadn’t thought of that before now. The alien vessel *was* shaped like a giant, flying wasp’s nest; and at near enough the center they had found a large alien that was being defended heroically by the others.



“Redirect all boarding parties to that room,” Dubois ordered.



“Yes, Ma’am,” answered the Combat Coordinator. He began directing teams to follow passages that looked like they might lead to the central room on the alien ship.



Dubois watched the tactical map as more Marine boarding parties converged on what she hoped was the control room of the alien vessel. On the view screens, Captain Frank was making headway now that reinforcements had caught up with him. The other team was struggling, but the aliens didn’t seem to be trying to overrun their position. It seemed as if they were trying to hold them back from entering the room with the ‘queen’.  Another team reached the alien control room via a third corridor, and was met by a wall of the wingless aliens. The Marines fired into the smaller aliens, but the aliens kept charging. They didn’t have the sharp double mandibles of the warriors, but once they got within reach of the Marines they reached out with their manipulators and tried to disarm the Marines. Another team arrived, and met yet another group of smaller aliens. Dubois could see the Marine boarding parties were gradually getting the upper hand on the tactical map as more and more Marines arrived. Captain Frank and his Marines finally burst into the room, having blasted their way through the final warrior that was blocking the way. Dubois watched in fascination as smaller aliens did their best to form a protective barrier between the queen and the Marines; but the Marines were tired of the firefight. A cloud of grenades were flung at the massed aliens, and explosions ripped apart the smaller workers. The giant queen staggered, having suffered from the shrapnel of the blasts. Other Marine teams entered the room and they all poured automatic weapons fire into the queen. It shrieked and beat the air with its forelegs until finally collapsing under the fusillade. As the queen died, so did any further resistance. The remaining worker aliens and warriors suddenly seemed lost and confused, wobbling on their legs unsteadily. The Marines pressed the attack, but Dubois saw several cameras shift to weird angles. She searched the view screens and realized all the camera views from the team leaders were titled at strange angles.



“What’s going on,” she asked the Combat Coordinator. “Why is everything tilting in different directions?”



“I don’t know Ma’am,” the Combat Coordinator replied. “It looks like they might be floating in zero-g now.”



Dubois looked closer and saw that the Marines were struggling to engage the remaining aliens because every time they fired they were being pushed around by the recoil. It took a few minutes, but finally the last wingless alien went limp under the fusillade of small arms fire and a silence settled over the scene.



“Command,” came the voice of Captain Frank over the speakers. “We’ve lost artificial gravity. I don’t know about atmosphere; but we’ve taken this central room. No controls that I can see, just a whole lot o’ passages going all different directions. Please advise.”



The Combat Coordinator glanced back at Dubois.



“Have them secure them room and standby,” Dubois ordered, walking over to ship phone on the wall.



“Hive mind?” mused Jameson.



Dubois nodded, picking up the phone and asking for the admiral.

  


Admiral Vong’s gravelly voice came over the line. “What have you got, Dubois?”



“I think we’ve secured a central control room, admiral,” Dubois replied. “Resistance collapsed with the death of what I think was their leader. Can you tell me if the alien vessel has stopped maneuvering and firing?”



Admiral Vong was silent for a moment, probably querying his staff. “You’re right,” he answered. “No guns or thrusters are operating that we can see; however, they’re launching a whole lot more of those drop pods. Seems they’re abandoning ship. Have you found where they’re coming from?”



Dubois shook her head as she answered, “We haven’t found any launch bays or escape pod chutes.”



“See if you can’t find where these bugs are coming from,” ordered Admiral Vong. “I’d like to shut them down before they get their entire complement onto the planet.”



“Aye aye, sir,” Dubois answered, and the line clicked off. She replaced the phone on the wall and met Jameson’s curious gaze. “They’ve stopped moving and firing the point defense; but they’re evacuating to the planet faster.”



“Curious,” remarked Jameson, finishing the last of his tea. “That means if they are a hive mind, they have a new leader or leaders. Probably on the surface.”



“Probably,” Dubois agreed. She turned to the Combat Coordinator. “Have the boarding teams search the alien vessel, moving along the outer passages. We want to find where the drop pods are coming from and shut them down.”



“Yes, ma’am,” the Combat Coordinator answered, turning and relaying the orders to the Marines on the alien vessel.



“And start bringing the wounded and dead back to *Hermes*,” Dubois ordered.



The Combat Coordinator acknowledged the order, and soon the representations of the Marines on the alien vessel began fanning out through the passages connected to the central control room.



“I’d be curious to know just how many aliens this hive ship carries,” Jameson commented quietly. “They’ve launched nearly fifteen thousand drop pods already; and they’re still launching.”



Dubois looked at her XO, wondering where he was getting these numbers. She followed his gaze to the Naval Communications Officer’s control station. Amidst the clutter of other information, there was a small window labeled ‘bogey count’ and a number rapidly ticking up. She wondered if that was something the Naval Communications Officer normally had on their control station, or if it was something they had up out of curiosity. Her attention was dragged back to the view screens by a sudden burst of gunfire over the speakers. She searched the screens, noting the strange angles made it more difficult to determine what was happening. Her eyes were drawn to muzzle flashes, and the sound of a S.A.W. thundered over the speakers even with the automatic reduction in sound. As it ceased, the angry humming noise from the first engagements came over the speakers and the shapes of wasp-like alien warriors loomed on the screen.



“Requesting backup,” called the Marine platoon leader over the comm link. He sounded tired and was panting slightly. “We’ve found a large concentration of alien fighters. They seem to be defending this position like the control room.”



“Roger that,” answered the Combat Coordinator, ordering two nearby teams to move towards the embattled Marines.



“I wonder if the teams are starting to suffer from zero-g sickness,” mused Jameson.



Dubois nodded. The first boarding parties were probably getting close to the halfway point on their air supply as well. She picked up the ship phone and asked for the admiral again. After a brief pause, Admiral Vong answered.



“What do you got, colonel?” 



“Sir, I’m going to need to start rotating my boarding parties back for air replenishment. Have you heard how the ground battle is going? Dubois asked.



Admiral Vong let out a sigh. “Nothing definite. The Planetary Defense Forces are scouting out the landing area where the drop pods have been landing; but nothing concrete. Has their ground commander been updating you on their force deployment?”



“Negative, sir,” Dubois answered, keeping her voice neutral. “He told me he would be in tactical and strategic control of all forces on the planet’s surface, and he is senior to me in rank.”



“Hmph,” snorted Admiral Vong. “I hate politics. How many Marines have you sent down so far?”



“I’ve deployed about two battalions to the surface,” Dubois answered. “The Buffalos are almost back for another load.”



Admiral Vong grunted. “Well, if he’s going to play power games then I say go ahead and prioritize your boarding parties. Sounds like things are getting off to a slow start down there anyway. General Strong will be here within an hour, and then he can take over dealing with the ground invasion. Any luck on finding the alien launch bays?”



“Possibly,” Dubois answered. “We have run into spirited resistance in an exterior corridor, which might lead to an evacuation area. I’m pushing more teams to break through as quickly as possible.” Dubois was grateful that Admiral Vong was making the decision to cut off the support for the ground defense. Even though she was a Stellar Marine officer and Colonel McCaffrey was a Colonial Adminstration officer, if she decided to withdraw support from the planet on her own it could be construed as insubordination. 



“Very well,” Admiral Vong said. “Keep up the pressure. If we can capture the launch bays, we’ll hamstring the ground invasion before it gets started.”



“Yes, sir,” Dubois replied gratefully as the line clicked off.



“Good news,” Jameson inquired, taking a sip of a fresh cup of tea.



Dubois wondered if he carried extra tea bags in his uniform pockets, as there was only a coffee pot available in the Combat Control Center. *Does he make his tea with coffee*, she wondered curiously as she replaced the ship phone. “Yes,” she answered. She turned to the Marine Communications Officer, “Tell the Buffaloes they’re back to transporting Marines to the alien vessel.” Turning back to Jameson she continued, “We’ve been ordered to stop the aliens from getting to the surface by taking the launch bays or whatever they’re using to send pods to the surface.”



“Good show,” Jameson answered. “Do we have any clue as to how many of these bays there are?” He angled himself to glance over at the Naval Communications Officer as he asked the question.



Dubois looked at the Naval officer as well, “Lieutenant, is there any information on where the aliens are launching drop pods from?”



The Naval Communications Officer typed into their terminal for a few seconds before responding. “Not anything definite,” he answered. “I can link the battlecruisers' sensors to your tactical map, but it’s not as detailed information as your teams are transmitting. There might be general areas to focus on, but that’s the best I can do.”



Dubois watched as the hologram of the alien vessel blinked a couple of times, then a swarm of tiny red dots appeared around outer portions of the alien hull. They did not move as seamlessly as the representations of the Marine boarding parties, instead seeming to jump about. It took Dubois a few seconds to realize the indicators of the alien drop pods were updating much slower than the Marines' transmitters, and the steady stream of drop pods leaving the hive ship were leaving the range of her tactical map before the updates came through. She pursed her lips and moved closer, studying the hologram and its spasmodic representation of the alien drop pods for a minute before she finally noticed a pattern. One of the areas that appeared to be where the drop pods were coming from was only a few yards from where the Marine Platoon was in contact with alien warriors.

  


“Control,” she ordered. “Direct the boarding parties towards these areas.” She indicated three areas on the alien hive ship’s hull where she guessed the drop pods were launching from.



The Combat Coordinator looked at where she was indicating, then replied, “Yes Ma’am.” 



“Interesting how much lag there is with all these fancy systems,” commented Jameson. “Top notch sensors and computers, but it still takes time for them to communicate.”



Dubois nodded silently. It was a disadvantage she was used to when deployed to the surface of a planet, since any information from Navy sensors had to travel through a planet’s atmosphere to her mobile command post. She hadn’t realized how bad coordinating information was just between the ships of the Task Force. She divided her attention between the tactical hologram and the view screens receiving the views of the platoon leaders of the boarding teams. Despite more boarding parties converging on the Marines in contact, they were making no progress in breaking through the aliens guarding access to the suspected launch bays. Other boarding parties ran into similar difficulties approaching the other suspected launch bays, being stopped cold by stout resistance from the aliens. 

Dubois flinched as she watched a Marine in the first team to come into contact fumble a live grenade. The Marine scrambled to recover, or maybe smother the blast with his own body; but it went off before he could get to it. Several Marines screamed in pain as shrapnel tore through their vacuum rated body armor, and bloody droplets started appearing in the zero-g environment. The aliens sensed an opening, and improbably launched their own attack. Dubois watched with growing dread as the aliens propelled themselves into the wounded Marines, tearing them apart with their vicious mandibles. The platoon leader emptied his carbine at the head of an alien tearing limbs off of an incapacitated Marine, struggling to push himself backwards with the uninjured members of his team.



“TALKING GUNS!” Screamed the panicking platoon leader as he struggled to reload. A moment later, a S.A.W. opened up, spraying through the cluster of Marine and alien bodies. As soon as it ended, another S.A.W. opened up and was joined by a couple of carbines. The screams of injured Marines, either being hit by friendly fire or torn apart by alien mandibles came through the speakers only partially muted by the noise suppression systems. Several members of the Combat Control team had lost color in their faces, hands clenched in frustration as they watched or listened to the carnage. The Combat Coordinator nearly shouted into his headset, trying to break the platoon leader out of his panic.



“Lieutenant Sims! Reset your marines! Get control of the situation! LIEUTENANT SIMS! REGROUP YOUR MEN!” The Combat Coordinator looked as if he wanted to reach through the view screen and shake the panicking lieutenant by the shoulders.



Major Jameson stepped up to the Combat Coordinator and tapped him on the shoulder, motioning for a headset. The Combat Coordinator picked up a spare headset, turning it on and setting it to the correct frequency before handing it to the major. Once the headset showed up as connected on the Combat Coordinator’s screen, he signaled Major Jameson with a thumbs up. Major Jameson motioned with his hand, signaling for the Combat Coordinator to take the frequency off the speakers. Once this was done, he started talking.



“Lieutenant Sims,” Major Jameson said in his calm, Oxford accent. “You need to get your men braced on the walls of that corridor. The recoil from your weapons is throwing you everywhere. Once you have a grip on the walls like those bugs do, you’ll be able to pull back in good order and set up a defensive position. There’s another platoon coming up to relieve you, you just need to get your men out of there in good order.”



Dubois watched as Major Jameson’s face took on a look of concentration as he listened. The view screen still showed a frantic firefight, the aliens pushing their advantage as they finished working through the wounded Marines. The screen shook as Lieutenant Sims fired his weapon at the oncoming aliens, crawling along the walls of the passage toward the survivors of his team. A marine with a S.A.W. grabbed onto the wall of the passage, taking a moment to brace himself before unloading into the oncoming horrors. His accuracy was much better, and one of the aliens stopped advancing as its face turned to pulp under the fusillade. Other Marines began finding foot and handholds on the walls, but the aliens were advancing rapidly. Lieutenant Sims’ carbine disappeared from view, replaced a moment later by a hand holding a grenade.



“Nice and easy, Sims,” Major Jameson coached. “Do it by the numbers, just like the training simulation. Your men are covering you, just prime and throw.”



Dubois watched in fascination. It almost seemed like the lieutenant went through the process of lobbing the grenade in slow motion as the decimated team around him poured fire into the advancing aliens. The grenade floated through the air, and the lead aliens stopped advancing. They clearly knew what the device was capable of, and it seemed as if they were trying to shield themselves from the blast. 



“Pull back slowly,” Major Jameson said into the headset. “Relief is close behind you. We’re talking them up to you, you just need to let them take the lead when they get there.”



The flash of the grenade's detonation blinded the camera for a moment, then the sight of aliens moving up through the smoke caused Dubois’ breath to catch. But several aliens were wounded, missing limbs or leaking fluids from their thorax. Another grenade, thrown by a different Marine, floated into the oncoming aliens and another explosion obscured the view. The Marines were pulling back slowly, the S.A.W. gunners firing at aliens as they appeared through the smoke and haze. The camera view shook suddenly, and it spun as Lieutenant Sims turned to look over his shoulder. The tinted faceplate of a Marine from the relief team nearly filled the view screen, and the private held a thumbs up in front of his faceplate. The view screen shook up and down as Lieutenant Sims obviously nodded his head, and Dubois heard the platoon leader of the team over the speakers.



“Control, we’ve reached One-Charlie’s position. Passing through now. Let’s see how eager these bastards are to fight now.”



Everyone in the Combat Control Center looked relieved as the fresh platoon moved up, pounding the aliens with fierce determination. Major Jameson took off the headset, turning it off and handing it back to the Combat Coordinator. Lieutenant Sims moved back with the survivors of his platoon, heading back along the passage as the Combat Coordinator directed him to a waiting Bison attached to the alien vessel’s hull. Major Jameson stepped back to his spot in the back of the room, picking up his mug of tea and taking a long sip.



“Nice job,” Dubois commented quietly.



“Thank you,” replied Jameson. “Lieutenant Sims is going to be in a hard place, I’m afraid. Pity, he was a promising officer; but it looks like he was put in command too soon.”



Dubois just nodded. With her background in armoured divisions, she wasn’t sure she would’ve been able to do any better than the lieutenant; and she’d had way more real life experience than Sims had. *Were any of us really ready for this,* she wondered, watching a half dozen desperate firefights playing out on the screens in front of her as her Marines struggled to reach the alien launch bays through valiant resistance. “We’ve got them cornered,” she murmured. “They’ll fight harder now, because they don’t have much left to lose.”

So then I’d start drinking really strong coffee and eat dates every day and put ground flaxseed in all my meals. And then after a month it would stop working. So anyways I’ve been dealing with this for a while but it’s gotten to the point where the past two weeks I haven’t been able to go to the bathroom without an enema. And even when I use one, I don’t feel completely emptied. I bought liquid magnesium citrate and it did absolutely nothing. I’ve been drinking the psyllium husk every day and my stomach just gets into more pain. I went to urgent care (because it’s a Saturday night) and he said I really need to see a GI specialist but in the meantime he will prescribe a stool softener. 

I feel like I’ve been kinda nauseous lately because my stomach is so backed up and there’s no more room for anything. I’m trying to stay hydrated and eat my meals but I take too bites and I’m full. I’m going to go ahead and see a GI specialist and they’re probably going to want to do a colonoscopy from what I understand. But is there anything else I can do? I’m kinda freaking out that I may have colon cancer but I’m trying to not fall down that rabbit hole ",2,1739673139.0,WomensHealth,2,1.0,False

So before morning rounds, my attending likes to drink 2 cokes and it’s a ritual of his every single morning. 

Well this particular morning, he had come in looking kinda disheveled and just overall crankier than usual. 

He says, cokes aren’t gonna cut it today I need something strong. He then tells me to go fetch him some coffee so I oblige. 

He takes a sip and then mumbles about it tasting funny. We divide up the census and before I leave to go round he turns to me and says, this tastes kind of funny did you do something to this? I start saying no I just grabbed the coffee pot at the nurses station and poured him a cup. 

He initially just let it go and I go round. As rounds were finishing I pass by the nurses station and examine the pot because I was curious at this point. 

Well… it was growing what looked like a colony of fungi when I opened the lid. It looked as if it was about to say grow eyes and say hello to me. And the stench…. I gagged and ran down the hall to meet my attending when I see him storm down the hall all energetic like. He starts going off about seeing elves everywhere and ants crawling in his arms. He pokes his finger into me and starts yelling at me accusing me of spiking his coffee. He dismisses me for the day and says he’ll speak for yourself my PD about this. Before I could say anything he storms off again.. 

This is going to be quite an interesting meeting come Monday. ",5,1739673117.0,medicalschool,4,0.67,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I have been taking tianeptine sulfate for 8 years at 150mg every 6 hours for treatment of permanent PSSD. I have been at this dosage for about 6 years, having built tolerance until finding a suitable maintenance dose. The effects have lessened the last four years, but it still mostly works for what I take it for.

I was recently prescribed generic bupropion HCL XL 150 mg 1 time per day for what seems like an array of symptoms of low dopamine. The prescription recommends increasing to 2 times per day after the first 7 days.

I am concerned about increased seizure risk or CNS depression considering the tianeptine dosage and potential interaction. What are the potential risks and how likely are they?

So, if your goal is to **reduce your weight** while also putting on **muscle** at the same time (yes, although a bit more work it CAN be done at the same time) and increase your energy, this may be a long post but I promise you it will be worth it.

 

By the end of the post, you will have the answers you want to get you out of the feeling of being **plateaued** and to drop the extra 15 lbs or more and **lean out**.

 

And NO at the end of this post, there will *not* be a link asking you to opt into your email for some weekend warrior course to follow or a link sending you to download a crappy lead magnet that gives you really low-quality information and then tries to get you to sign on to a program.

 

No this is just going to be put out there for you to gain value from so you can start getting some wins!

 

But you have to remember one thing.

 

You **NEED** to apply it and keep applying it consistently every week.

 

Where there is no consistent action there are no **results**.

 

But if you just keep working with it, I promise you the **results** will come **through**.

If you’re juggling the demands of a busy professional life, you’ve probably thought about getting back into shape but feel stuck.

Maybe you’ve tried before but didn’t get the results you wanted.

Maybe life got in the way, and you’ve struggled to find the time to focus on your health.

Whatever your reasons, I want you to know it’s not too late to reclaim your health and build a body you’re proud of.

It is never too late. NEVER. The oldest client I had helped was 65 years of age and he improved in all areas of fitness, built muscle, and increased his energy.

So, there is no excuse at all.

This post will outline everything you need to know to start transforming your physique and take back control of your health in just 12 weeks.

You’ll drop those pounds, build some muscle, increase your energy become de-stressed and finally feel as though you can make some real progress.

 

So, let’s get this going!

 

I’m gonna start off the bat by saying I have been a fitness/health coach for the past 18 years and I service men online and in person.

 

But I don’t care about that nor am I writing this for that. It’s just to show that I have some credibility.

 

I’m here because I just want to provide value.

 

I generally cater to business owners/corporate ladder-working males who have a hectic lifestyle however anyone can apply these methods.

 

**Why Most Fitness Programs Fail**

The truth is, that the fitness industry often overlooks the unique challenges faced by men in their 30s, 40s, and 50s.

Generic plans *might* work for you but it may not always be the case.

Actually, more often than not you may get some results but you could be stopping yourself from possibly processing further.

Here’s why:

**One-Size-Fits-All Solutions:**

Most programs don’t consider YOUR specific needs. What you can handle, what your power output for exercises are.

It really does matter that you put some effort into designing a plan that is going to help shape not just your physique, but your **life**.

Just taking any plan off the internet can possibly get you by but you want a plan that’s going to be more **specific** towards your needs.

You are not the same as everyone else and wouldn’t want to have a program suited for you.

Sure, some things might come to be the same. All guys are going to want to do bicep exercises.

But how big do you want your arms to be?

What parts of your body do you want to develop more?

What exercises do you want to put time towards?

How will you develop the exercise part of the program to maximize time if you can only give so much time a day if you’re a busy person?

What foam rolling and stretching techniques will you use to combat inflation? (I see you rolling your eyes, yes this is important especially the more you age).

What are your calories?

What are your macro settings within your calorie intake?  

How much cardio are you applying every week (yes that’s right I said *cardio* the bad C word that you tend to shudder and stay away from, I’ll explain why you should be adding it in and how to do it where it doesn’t feel so dreadful and the importance of it).

And blah blah blah etc.

I could go on; there's quite a bit to go cover.

But this is important to know.

You don’t want cookie-cutter stuff; you want a **specific program** that can work.

But again, don’t worry down below I will have some answers for you as I want to provide solutions.

And NO, I know you’re thinking of skipping, **don’t**. Spend the time to read through this so you get ALL the context and not just some of it.

When you have to fix something in your house needs more than just the usual hammer and nail to fix it, you don’t just bring a few tools you THINK you need, you bring the whole toolbox.

Well, this whole read is your toolbox.

**Lack of Accountability:**

Without someone to guide you and keep you on track, it’s easy to lose motivation and especially direction.

This falls on you to stay **consistent** and be ready. A lot of programs, like ALL of them really, don’t help you to deal with this. This completely falls up to you.

You need to surround yourself with the right information to help you **stay focused** and succeed.

Getting into groups (like the one you joined here, a slight pat on the back for you my friend) helps to keep you focused.

Getting away from people or certain events that could steer you off track could benefit you.

If you are the type to be easily persuaded and have weak resistance then sit out for a while since this is very **important** to you.

Accountability and having no structural habits kill people's momentum and ultimately their results.

Always stay **engaged** in your quest towards your fitness goals, always stay **focused**, and keep your goals in the forefront of your mind.

**Unrealistic Expectations:**

This is a big one that you keep digging yourself a grave into.

You have set these **expectations** for yourself based on someone else’s before and after pictures when you know NOTHING about what they had to go through to get there.

How long it took, what their experience in working out is, what struggles they went through, etc.

But you also can’t be too hard on yourself as truth be told, you probably didn’t know better as you have been sold something different on the internet.

But I am going to tell you it’s not always that simple.

As a **matter of fact**, more often than not it isn’t and then you have to take into consideration that as you start to see results you may hit roadblocks along the way.

People go through different circumstances and **health scares** in life that could derail them or slow them down.

I’ve spent years working with men like you who’ve faced these same challenges.

The key to success isn’t necessarily about doing more; it’s about doing what works for your life.

It’s about incorporating how it can fit your schedule and then **challenging yourself** enough to keep **progressing** but not destroying yourself.

I have found some guys can go balls to the wall even if they are just starting and succeed and get results over time.

But **more often than not** people can’t do that.

You have to be willing; you have to be dedicated; you have to be determined and you have to take action and stay consistent.

But that is a different level for everyone.

You MUST ALWAYS be moving forward with **no excuses** but it should be at a pace you can handle while you don’t bullshit yourself AND while holding yourself **accountable**.

**Knowing your Nutrition**

**Calories:**

The first thing you need to do is learn to measure your calories. Out of anything else, this is the most **important thing**.

What you are going to do is calculate 7 days in a row of EVERYTHING you eat. Doesn’t matter if you eat one meal or 5 meals in a day.

If you undereat or overeat, if it’s junk food or healthy, don’t change anything now because you're conscious of it.

Write everything down and how many calories are in each food you eat.

Write down how many calories you are taking from your beverages as well. Mark everything down.

When you do this, you will be surprised at how much you are actually eating. A lot of people **undercalculate** what they intake, it’s been shown in numerous studies so don’t be so sure that you don’t do it either.

After you have calculated one week's worth and have your rough caloric intake for every day for seven days, you then will add up all seven days and divide it by seven because, well you guessed it, there are seven days in a week!

Now once you have this number, you’re going to drop 300 to 500 calories from that number to be in a deficit.

Because even though your calories may not be consistent every day, we are trying to get you structured and situated where your metabolism gets regulated with the same flow of food intake daily while consistently staying in a deficit.

This also builds a great habit for you to become structured in your approach to your nutrition.

Being in a calorie deficit you will possibly see some energy loss. This can be migrated through some of the foods you intake and also maintaining fiber to around 30g but you will have to play with this a bit, everyone is different.

I can’t tell you how many times different clients have reacted to this when in a weight loss phase. But this is why you have to also give it some time, generally 2 weeks to adapt.

Remember you are taking less food which means less energy. Do your best to eat nutritiously dense foods to stay full when you can but even if it bothers you, you will adapt.

 There are people online now, some with a lot of followers, and think they seem to be in a place or position to say that counting calories doesn’t work.

And I’m going to tell you that is a load of **bullshit**. Yes, it is possible that you don’t have to count calories to have weight loss or even just make healthier choices to get results.

But this is a form of measurement, and what gets measured gets accomplished. It’s another way big way to enable your success.

I can already hear some people complaining now. “Uh but do I really have to? No, you don’t but if you are serious about weight loss or your health in general then why wouldn’t you want to learn something that could help?

If you're already complaining now and don’t want to put in any effort then you don’t care.

And why leave a form of measurement unchecked when it can help get you to the results you want, especially when it’s the most effective method, proven to work, backed by science and biology, and has loads of studies that show its effectiveness?

It’s not even up for argument as it’s just a fact that it works.

**Macros:**

Now that you have the foundation on how many calories you are taking, you need to see how many macros you will be having within that calorie limit.

 

Higher protein is a must as it aids the most in weight loss and helps with **sustaining muscle** as much as possible when you are in a weight loss phase.

 

Just note, that if you don’t completely hit these numbers all the time it’s fine. Not every food or meal is going to have exactly the macros you need and your body still utilizes fats and carbs for muscle building as well so don’t sweat it.

 

Just do your best.

 

So, you’re going to take your total calorie intake, let’s say it’s 2000 calories for the example and you will divide it by the percentages you give each macro.

 

2000 calories total

50% protein - 2000 x .50 = 1000

30% carbs - 2000 x .30 = 600

20% fats - 2000 x .20 = 400

 

Based on the calculations you would be dedicating 1000 calories to protein, 600 calories to carbs, and 400 to fats.

 

What kind of carbs and fats and protein you need or should be using doesn’t matter as much now.

 

You just need to focus on bringing down the weight and building some muscle.

 

Follow the basics first and then you can get into the more in-depth things later on.

 

But make sure to go based on what you calculated your calories to. And stick to it day after day with **CONSISTENT** effort and putting in the best effort you can.

 

There will be distractions, and you will have people who try to derail you but if you stay consistent you will see success.

 

**Cheat Meals:**

 

I already know what you’re thinking. “But what about cheat meals??” or “There's no way I can give up coffee with cream”.

 

You don’t have to. No one is saying you need to give it up.

 

If you CHOOSE to go down a route to eliminate certain foods because you believe it will help you better sustain your ability to stay **consistent** then do so.

 

This is fine; however, you still need to be in a **deficit**.

 

Where you have gone wrong before is when you were told you could have a cheat meal right away on the weekend.

 

You see when you did that you ended up eating the calories you had lost during the week from being in a deficit, or worse, you ended up eating a little more.

 

People do not understand how having that one meal with several drinks can place you right back into the same position you were just starting a week ago.

 

So, can you have cheat meals? Of course! But you need to do it strategically.

 

First off, you can’t eat great and be in a deficit for five days and then overload on the weekend. You always, **ALWAYS** need to be in the form of a deficit to **lose the weight** and continue to do so.

 

So, you can either do two things here.

 

You can have the food you want as long as you're in a deficit and you always stay in a deficit.

 

Or

 

You eat straight into a deficit for 13 days and then on the 14^(th) day or the next weekend, whatever your schedule permits, you have the meal you have been wanting to have.

 

This way, even if you go overboard a bit, you have been in a deficit for 2 straight weeks which will still keep you in a deficit even if you happen to have a meal with higher calories.

 

I mean as long as you're not vacuuming food like you’re at a hot dog-eating competition you’ll be fine.

 

This is great because it gives you **options** on what route you want to take, be able to enjoy certain foods you like, and still be in a deficit.

 

Or if you prefer to just stay in a **continued deficit** for longer you can do that too.

 

I have clients now and have had clients in the past who just enjoy a continued deficit. They prefer the idea of knowing they won’t taste certain foods that will trigger them to want to go and binge eat certain foods.

 

It really depends on the person but the options are there for you to take.

 

**Designing Your Weight Lifting Program**

 

Be honest. How many times have you walked into the gym, looked around, scratched your head, and just decided to try anything that was in front of you?

 

Or how many basic exercise routines have you used on the internet in the gym and applied haphazardly with no real results?

 

Probably **several times.**

 

You left feeling the gym knowing it was an underwhelming workout and you know it yourself.

 

You don’t want to be feeling as though you left the gym knowing it was just a blah workout.

 

You want to be **challenged**.

 

Not *killed* or *destroyed*.

 

But **challenged**.

 

Never be scared of that word when it comes to lifting weights and fitness as it will be your best friend in terms of allowing you to grow, **gain results,** and become stronger over time.

 

**Weightlifting:**

 

For now, you will dedicate a total of five days to exercise.

 

Five days?!

 

Yes, five days.

 

If you want to start seeing **great results** and put yourself in a position to keep maintaining them you are going to have to challenge yourself.

 

Remember I said to **challenge** not destroy. And down below I’ll show you how this can be applied for a total of five days of a program without you killing yourself but challenging you enough to keep getting results.

 

One thing I highly suggest you do is to write everything out.

 

The program you end up putting together from the information below should be written out so you know **EXACTLY** what you will be doing for the next 3 months.

 

There is no guessing, no thinking, just **action**, **consistency**, and **results**. That’s it

 

So make sure to either write it down, put it on your phone or computer, or whatever, just make sure to know exactly what you are going to be doing.

 

**What Exercise to Do:**

 

For three days out of the week, you will be doing weight lifting. You can pair any muscle groups together but it must be two of them.

 

I generally like to do

 

Chest/back

Legs/Biceps

Triceps/Shoulders

 

But you can do any combo you want. It’s really up to you.

 

Spread these out during the week. Something like Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday can work. If your schedule doesn’t allow it because you’re a very busy person then spread them out as best as possible.

 

**Don’t** stack them three days in a row, spread them out.

 

**Sets and Reps:**

 

This is where the **intensity** and building of **muscle** and aid with weight loss comes in.

 

You want to stay consistent with your repetitions and sets.

 

Now there are MANY techniques and ways you could go about doing this but again I’m going to simplify it for you to be able to get challenged and then increase with progressive overload and keep getting challenged.

 

For the first month:

 

For the first 4 weeks, you are going to aim for 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps.

 

You are going to do 3 different combinations of exercises by pairing a group together and super-setting them.

 

As an example, if you were doing chest and back then you can do a barbell chest press and then right after doing a bent-over dumbbell back row. This would count for one set. And aim for twelve to fifteen reps.

 

For the second month:

 

For the next 4 weeks, you are going to do three sets of fifteen reps.

 

You are going to do three different combinations of exercises by again pairing two groups of muscles.

 

You can keep the combinations the same, or you can change them it’s really up to you.

 

For the first two weeks, after every three sets, you are going to do one set of a conditioning exercise.

 

It could be various things such as but not limited to.

 

Running on the spot, feet switch, various methods of using battle ropes, ball slams, getting on the recumbent bike, going for a jog on the treadmill, etc.

 

You want to keep a medium intensity when doing these exercises for 45 seconds.

 

Don’t do this nonchalantly, put a bit of **effort** into it to get your heart moving a bit.

 

Be the best judge for yourself on what you can do but **challenge** yourself.

 

For the last two weeks of the second month, you are going to add this in two times. So, you will do three sets of a combination of exercises.

 

Then do your one 45-second conditioning exercise.

 

Then, move on to do another three sets of another combination of exercises.

 

And now complete another 45-second conditioning exercise. It could be the same one or another, that is completely up to you.

 

For the third month:

 

For the next 4 weeks, you are going to do three sets of fifteen reps and more. The aim is to try and do more than fifteen repetitions.

 

If you have noticed for the past two months, we have been building muscle conditioning and also continually challenging your muscles for **growth**.

 

For the first two weeks of the second month, you are going to add conditioning exercises two times.

 

For the final two weeks, you will add in a conditioning exercise of your choice after every three sets for the entire session.

 

 

**Cardio:**

 

Now I know you hate cardio. It’s become the bad word to use within the firstness world especially if you are someone who prefers lifting completely.

 

You may have even been told some garbage like it completely breaks down muscle tissue, which is widely exaggerated as nutrition has a bigger part to play than most people think.

 

But for you, I want to highly encourage you to add in cardio. If you want to get the full benefits from this and give yourself the best chance of success then add it in.

 

It’s not just for weight loss purposes, although it will greatly help with this as well.

 

It’s also beneficial to strengthen your heart which obviously allows you to live longer.

 

And because you strengthen your lungs further and increase heart strength, you will also notice you can breathe easier and longer.

 

To me it’s a no-brainer and a win/win for you and the benefits you gain out of it are way worth it.

 

So, along with everything you are doing listed within the months up above, on two other days, you want to add in cardio.

 

Now let me be clear here. **EVERYONE** is on a different level on what they can handle with cardio.

 

You need to listen to your body and do what you can **handle**.

Start off with 10 to 15 minutes of walking on two other days of the week. For the first month.

 

Speed walking is great, usually a 3.0 to 4.0 speed on a treadmill generally is great to start off at.

 

Then up that in the second month, add in a light jog every 5 minutes. So, you will walk for five minutes and when you hit that five-minute mark you are going to jog for 20 to 30 seconds.

 

Repeat this process for 15 minutes.

 

In the third month, you just want to increase the allotted time from 15 minutes to 20 minutes.

 

Remember, we are creating progressive overload and continually wanting to challenge ourselves with smaller incremental increases for **growth**.

 

But **listen** to your body on what you can do and handle.

 

 

**The Results of Continued Action:**

 

So now you have your method to start making progress and getting the success you want when it comes to dropping body fat and leaning out with adding muscle in 12 weeks' time.

I want you to **imagine** you walking home after working out at the gym.

You get inside and go upstairs to change and shower after a good and fulfilling gym session.

As you get into your room, you stop to realize the **noticeable change** you see in certain areas of your body, such as the **weight loss** within your face and neck area and the muscle you have developed in your arms and chest.

You then happen to look over to a picture you have above your bedside with you and some friends. You can see the expression on your face in that picture and remember even though you were smiling you weren’t exactly happy.

You remember the stress you were enduring, the lack of confidence you emanated, and the exhaustion you would feel even from walking up a smaller flight of stairs.

You were never even that big of a guy but you wanted to **lose weight**, you hated not having definition in your physique and didn’t like not feeling as though you didn’t feel your age.

But now, when you look in the mirror, that was something of the past as you have **primed yourself** into the new version of yourself.

One that’s **less in weight**, increased **energy**, increased **strength**, more **vibrant**, and **confidant** too.

Just then your girlfriend opens the door and comes in. You greet her and tell her to come on upstairs into your room.

As she comes into the room to say hi, she notices the results and **smiles** and compliments you on your success so far.

And you realize this is just the start. You are going to blow past this get even **more results** and continue to grow yourself into a better version of yourself every month.

You see this isn’t that far off from you to enjoy. It’s in the near future.

If you stay focused and move towards it.

You now know what you were doing wrong.

You have the methods on what to do for the next three months.

Now you just need to implement them.

You got this. This isn’t something complicated. It just requires consistent effort and discipline to achieve.

And all you literally need to do in order to achieve these results,

If you’re into gardening, you know it’s about time to start your seeds for vegetables like peppers and eggplants, and soon enough tomatoes and cold veggies. Looking at my seed packets today gave me the realization that there are some things I’m just never going to grow. So, I’d love to organize a seed swap…tomorrow. Because why not?! (Plus I’m busy or out of town the next few weekends. And if you’ve never started your veggies from seeds and are curious, I love helping people learn how to get started (though my experience comes from years of trial and error and **lots** of YouTube videos). Either way, feel free to come on by!

I figured somewhere public and located near public transit and with parking nearby would be best.

Here are the details:

**Where**: Sonder Coffee & Tea - 2000 S. Colorado Blvd., Denver, CO 80222 (in Junction Food Hall). This is adjacent to the Colorado Station public transit stop and there’s lots of parking, too.

**When**: Sunday, February 16 from 9a - 12p

**What**: A garden vegetable, herb, and flower seed swap. If you have seeds that you don’t plan to use or have excess of, bring them! Or, even if you don’t have seeds but want to be part of Community, feel free to join! (And everyone should feel free to give of their excess).

**Who**: You, the person reading this. And anyone else you think would be into this.

**How**: Bring little baggies (no judgement) or  envelopes or some other type of container to take away the seeds. 

**Why**: Because gardening is a form of resilience, resistance, and helps create community! (And that’s what I need right now ☺️)

I hope some of you can join!",1,1739672311.0,DenverMeets,0,1.0,False

I've been watching a lot of Charlotte Dobre lately, and I am DYING to know what she would have to say about this one! I consider myself a fairly chill person and not a grudge holder, but even though this all went down about a year and a half ago, I can't ""forgive and forget"" because it is still so comically shocking and absurd to me how all this went down. Maybe I'm petty for holding on to it still- you be the judge. Either way, laugh with me!

A couple years ago, I (26F, then 24F) cat sat for an acquaintance my age, we'll call him Mark (yes, the cat sitting is important, we'll get there). A couple of weeks after that, I learned why he needed a last minute pet sitter: his girlfriend of 5+ years whom he was living with had just left him for another guy. He was DEVASTATED. He's a very private person, but when I found out that he was having such a hard time, I went out of my way to be there and support him. All those nights when the ex would have her new guy over to her and Mark's apartment (they couldn't break the lease), he was at my place. He needed to rant to someone, I was the person. I even let him sleep in my bed and I took the couch because at his place, she had the bed and he was sleeping on the couch, and I told him that whenever he wanted to stay over, it was totally fine, I just wanted him to be able to sleep in a bed sometimes. I didn't expect anything in return except the basic respects one pays a friend, which I think is normal.

Well, fairly quickly, he starts seeing someone else, we'll call her Alex (I was not friends with her before this), and he did the thing where he cut out everyone else in his life and only ever hung out with her.  this included me after 4-ish months of him basically living with me, one of those months in which his cat also lived with me (they had a maintenance problem with the apartment, and the apartment didn't allow cats, why this young lad moved in there with a cat I don't know). I had tried a few times to message saying that it would be great to see him more and I'd love if we could find a time to hang out, no dice. There was an incident where I wound up needing to be there for me as a friend, it was something I could plan ahead for and tried to, and the day of, he stood me up. I told him I was hurt, and he avoided the problem because he's very nonconfrontational, and as a result, he completely avoided me (I don't want to say a coward, but if the shoe fits...). 

Cue The Great Cat Caper. 

As I mentioned, his cat lived with me for a month, and after I had to give the cat back, I was heartbroken and realized how good having a cat was for my mental health. However, the coming summer I was traveling out of state for 2 months for work, and I didn't want to get a cat and then immediately leave. Mark also had a summer program that ran for about a month, so the plan was for me to watch his cat while he was gone, and then he would watch mine. Only after this was established did I then go about adopting a cat. Well, I tried checking in about this, even though he wasn't talking to me because he knew he messed up, but I didn't hear anything until the day before when he told me that Alex was going to watch the cat. Immediately, my heart sank because I knew he was going to bail on watching my cat, so without telling him, I made other arrangements. And this was fine for about a week and a half: Mark left, his cat was in his shared apartment with the ex, Alex was going to feed her, I had my little cat and my own business to mind. Perfect. After that first week and a half, Alex messages me and says she wants to go visit her parents for a few days because it was her birthday, asking if I could watch the cat. Totally fine, I ask the date range in which she will be gone, I get the key from her, I feed the cat for a few days. The day after the last date in the range she offered, she says she is finally coming back into town and will get the key from me. I tell her that I already fed the cat that morning because I had a very busy day that day (which I did, I didn't even have time to eat, if she wanted the key, she could have gotten back on time or at least communicated with me, but no), and I would see about getting her the key when I could. 

Later that afternoon, I get a phone call from Mark's EX-GIRLFRIEND, whom he is still living with. There's an apartment showing for their place at 10 am tomorrow. The apartment doesn't allow cats. Mark is out of state and has the cat there. He's not answering any messages from her (fairly, she isn't great), and she's trying to figure out a plan, she knows I had the cat before and that I am currently the one with the house key, is there any possibility that I can take the cat so they can show the apartment in less than 24 hours? I say short answer yes, long answer call me for details. We work it out because Mark hasn't said a word to either of us. I get a text from Alex saying that she heard what the ex asked me, and ""I'm sorry, but I think that's obnoxious of her."" Unhelpful, if Mark has a problem, he can tell me, it's his cat. So the ex and her new boyfriend and I bundle up the cat and take the cat over to my place, and it truly was the most awkward of times. I was so frustrated with everyone involved except the cat at that point. Now I have two cats that hate each other in my tiny little apartment, if you've ever had to introduce cats, you know how this is, they had separate rooms to minimize damage, but hey, worth it to help a friend, right?

The next morning, I get a message from Mark finally briefly apologizing for standing me up on an important day like he did, and at the bottom, he snuck in an ""oh, and I hear you have my cat."" After weighing the options, he takes me up on my offer to keep the cat with me until he gets back because the apartment showings are too unpredictable. Totally fine with me, I offered, happy to help a friend when he needs it, even if said friend as been acting like an AH as of late.

This is where it gets laughably wild. Around this time, we were working a gig together, and he needed some materials for it. I told our director that I could take his and give them to him when he gets back in to town, I know when he'll be back, I can pass things along when he comes to get his cat. Normal, right? Well, the first day or two after he's back go past, and I hear NOTHING. Weird. I'm going to this gig, and the director is asking me what the deal is, I tell him I don't know, I still have Mark's materials and his cat. After the third or fourth day, this starts feeling ridiculous. So I do what any rational person would do and started a betting ring amongst my coworkers at this gig about when he would finally come get his cat back (and of course, they are all appalled that he just left me with his living creature and didn't say a word.) Remember, I'm leaving for two months, and the day I'm leaving is coming up soon after this gig is done, so Mark doesn't have forever and he knows it...  

One day, I'm at a coffee shop doing some work. I look out the window and I SEE MARK AND ALEX WALKING DOWN THE STREET LAUGHING AND ARM IN ARM. Mark's cat is fully still in my apartment, and I have not heard a THING even addressing the fact that I have his creature, let alone making plans to come get her. Furious. Furious is what I was. Obviously, I tell the people at the gig, oh guess who I saw today! ""Oh, did he finally come get his cat?"" ""Oh. No, he still hasn't said a word to me since he has been back, but he's definitely in town."" It was honestly so funny, people were INVESTED in this saga because Mark's behavior was so mind-blowing, especially because a lot of other people there were pet owners (and courteous, respectful humans). Eventually things need to actually get done for this gig, so the director reaches out to him and either Mark cancels or the director says don't come, I forget which, but now the gig is done and I give the materials back. All of us at the gig lose the bet from my little betting ring, the gig is now over and I haven't heard anything.

 Now we're into double digit days of him being back in town and not talking to me about his cat (let's remember that I went out of my way to bail him out in a pinch). I ran out of the cat's litter that she used. I used mine for my cat instead, which his cat didn't like, so she peed on my bed, and that was the last straw. The next day I caved and texted the most awkward ""...do you want your cat back?"" I could muster because WHY was that a question that even had to be asked!!! He made up some excuse about apartment showings, and I said okay, if it's a problem, I can keep her up until I leave town. He says to me ""no, it's okay, I can just lock her in a closet if people come."" LOCK HER IN A CLOSET. So I then said ...so now you're telling me the showings have nothing to do with it? If you were me and I was you, how would you be feeling about me right now? 

So three or four days after that, he gets his damn cat out of my apartment (and yes, I did make him pay me for the new litter I bought and the load of laundry that I did for my bedsheets). This is two days before I am leaving long term, and he says to me offhandedly, ""Did you figure out what you're going to do with your cat?"". SIR. Mind you, he never actually cancelled on me for watching my cat for 2 months; I'm not an idiot and I knew to be prepared and thankfully I was, but SIR. What he doesn't know: I was filling his cat in on ALL the drama while he was away, so I hope she gave him hell when he got back.

I've seen him since, and I always greet him with a robust and friendly ""Hi Mark! How are you?"" because I know he's too cowardly to not be nice in that moment. I look him right in his eyes and make him sit in that shame for the duration of our conversations, and I know that's exactly what he's doing because I can see the fight or flight response in his face. It's a petty thrill.

That's my story- I have never in my life felt so completely slapped in the face (and such a hard slap) so quickly by someone that I went that far out of my way to be nice to. In retrospect, it's hysterical. Without having his cat, I never would have gotten mine! But WOW, truly, who does that? I will probably be laughing about this until I am old and gray, and I hope some of you lovely potatoes got a good laugh too 🥰",1,1739672083.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

What does this mean for my long term relationship with my (30F) girlfriend?,"This question isn’t about this cashier specifically, but rather about the implications of my feelings about this event for my relationship.

Last week, I visited a store I hadn’t been to before. The cashier (31F) greeted me, and I felt an instant attraction. This is not something that normally happens to me, but I could barely think about what I was actually shopping for because I was only thinking about this cashier. When I went to check out, I was all smiles, and all I could think about was wanting to ask them out for coffee or something. 

I didn’t! Because I’m in a 4-year relationship. And I feel bad about what I did next, but when I got home, I read the receipt that had their first name on it. You know, “Served By: Name.” I did a quick Google search and it led me to their (31F) Instagram where I got the feeling that we have similar interests and maybe could get along. Describing this makes me feel disgusting and like I’m already cheating. But that was last week. I haven’t done anything (not visited their profile again/visited store/etc) since then. But all I have been thinking about is wanting to go back to the store around the same time, hoping to catch them working, to just ask them for coffee. 

As for my relationship with my girlfriend (30F), we met when we both were much younger, 7 years ago, and have been dating for 4. She has been incredibly supportive of me and has really helped me grow for the better. We’ve both grown a lot, but we’ve grown together. She is definitely my best friend and I spend most of my free time with her and enjoy it.

We’re both highly educated working professionals with long hours (a job that requires a lot of schooling) who own our own separate homes in different areas of the state. She doesn’t want to move in to mine, desiring to maintain her proximity to her local friends and family, and maintain her investment. I don’t want to move into her place or location either for similar reasons. We stay at each other’s houses, or separately, but rarely spend more than a couple days apart. She hasn’t brought up wanting to get married and she feels iffy about it overall given her parents’ messy divorce. She knows she absolutely doesn’t want kids, while I feel more undecided about it. Our sex life isn’t dazzling, but we’re incredibly emotionally bonded and do have close, sensual time. I’m attracted to her, but I don’t feel like she’s the most beautiful woman I’ve ever met. 

I can’t say I feel absolutely “head over heels” excited about the prospect of spending my entire life with her. I feel like I am attempting to make the most of it with the assumption that this is what a good relationship is like: it’s not heaven but the majority of the time you are happy.

The first time I tried ""coffee"", I bought it at this fancy, expensive coffee shop, but turns out the drink they gave me had no coffee in it. It was good though. 

So, technically yesterday was my first time trying coffee. I went to a coffee shop during lunch but good coffee is really expensive, and I didn't have much money with me, so I ended up going to a gas station, where they sold coffee. I bought a $1 vanilla bean espresso, and it was really good, my only complaint is that it didn't taste strongly enough like coffee, because the vanilla drowned it out quite a bit. 

I headed back to the school just in time for seminary, where I finished the last little bit of my ""Hot chocolate"". 

Sorry if this is boring I just like hearing about others' stories trying coffee for the first time, so I figured I'd post mine here. ",5,1739671706.0,exmormon,2,1.0,False

I have a homie in my class year who I’ve been secretly crushing on with since law school but he’s not gay. Still we are homies and I don’t want to lose him to anyone.  

He told me two weeks ago that he’s been having a thing with this female associate in capital markets, and that they’re going out for Valentine’s Day. I said that’s great man but inside I was fucking jealous. 

And there’s this female partner I get along with quite well, maybe she subconsciously knows we have the same taste in guys? I’ve always seen her staring at my homie with longing in her eyes and while I’m also jealous I knew she had no chance because my homie isn’t interested in 55 year old women, “Midnight Siren” or not (I’ve heard Pete the maintenance staff call her this in front of the coffee lady). The midnight siren and I always got along fairly well because I would give her compliments on her nails, hair and her excellent leadership. So I took the opportunity to subtly hint to her about my homies Valentine’s Day plans, and that she should do something about it. I said it subtly enough she thinks it’s her own idea. 

It worked! Now, instead of eating raw fish with some girl, my homie is now burning the midnight oil on an MTD next to me in my office on Valentines Day, while I work on my deposition outline. Every accidental brush of his elbows on mine makes my heart jump. I hope that one day we will become partners together and run this law firm like a power couple.

I wish I never found out the reason why. Ending.","When Sam lurched forward, coughing up writhing red lumps, I felt my body stiffen.

Kaz didn't move, his dark eyes glued to Sam.

He just sat there, motionless, watching the boy splinter.

Sam didn't stop. I don't think he could anymore. 

His body was limp and wrong, his arms by his sides, bulbous lumps of red running down his chin. 

""That night, I came to break things off with you,” he whispered, violently retching up each word. “I wanted to tell you I was done. With your games. That you were screwing with my head and making me fucking crazy!"" He broke into a sob, which turned into a laugh. 

""But you didn't even answer the door. *He* did.”

His grin widened, scarlet slew beading down his neck. ""It would always be *him*.""

His eyes found Kaz, narrowing. ""And I hated you for it.""

Kaz hummed. ""Go on.""

""I had an… excuse."" This time, his words were unnatural, violently torn from his mouth, ripping open his lips. 

Sam swayed back and forth, a childish giggle escaping him. ""When I lost you, I finally had an excuse to torture the devil wearing your face, and I actually… I actually enjoyed it.”

Risking a glance at him, I knew Sam wasn't lying. 

He *meant* each cut he'd sliced into Kaz. Every puncture through his flesh. 

It was his fucked up way of justifying his torture– when in reality, he had hurt him.

And even now, after actively fighting to save Kaz, Sam was still convinced he was a *Devil*. 

Kaz let out a breathy laugh, and it was so human—his head tipping to the side, his eyes rolling, like he was laughing at a bad joke. But then I saw the inhuman twitch in his lips.

""Wait,"" he murmured. ""You think I loved him?""

He grabbed Sam by the cheek, forcing him to look at him, his grin widening.

""I did,"" he whispered, dragging his teeth across Sam's neckline.

""That's what you wanted to hear, right? That I was always in love with him? That you were just a—"" he broke into a manic giggle, ""a fucking distraction, Sammy?""

I had never witnessed the true unraveling of a human mind before.

Until now.

I watched the light fizzle from Sam’s eyes, his jaw going slack.

His body went limp, swaying to the left before crumpling to the ground. 

He curled into the fetal position, eyes vacant, choking up slithering scarlet. 

Before I could speak, Kaz stepped forward, crouched over Sam’s trembling body, and ripped his spine from his back—starting gently before yanking it free with a violent tug. Sam’s body flopped with a wet smack, his entrails pooling onto the concrete.

""It’s true, Sammy,"" Kaz sighed, waving the bloody vertebrae. ""I liked you. But you weren’t him. And I’m sorry for that.""

Kaz's gaze flashed to me, curious, and something in my chest... jerked.

I could feel them—words, tangled thoughts.

Intimate thoughts I kept down, kept suppressed, creeping into my mouth in a bloody mouthful of sour saliva. My throat contorted, my mouth prying open, like my roommate was physically forcing it open.

I don't regret what I did to you.

I don't regret what I did to you.

I don’t rEGRET what I DID to YOU.

Kaz smirked, but he let go, letting the words trickle back down.

""Anything you want to tell me, Nin?"" he asked.

Yes.

The words were there, choking me, hemorrhaging my throat.

They were wrong, selfish, and yet so human. They were mine.

Still, I knew his answer.

Kaz was playing with me—of course he was.

He let the words slide back down.

""Thalvi,"" he said, the moon dripping from his tongue. ""Looks like I won the game!""

He yanked me up, pulling me close, his mouth dancing across the bridge of my ear.

""After everything you've done to us,"" he murmured, chuckling, ""do you really think you're even in his line of sight?""

I didn’t—couldn’t—reply, and he squeezed my fingers in his.

“Walk with me.”

In the corner of my eye, Sam’s body was already rewriting itself into existence.

The irony of Sam Fuller also being a ‘devil’ was almost comedic. 

“I need your help,” Kaz said, pulling me up stone steps leading to the town hall entrance.

“We have a… situation with the King,” he announced, twisting around to face me. 

“Now, it's usually easy to re-educate a human mind and fill them with her light.” Kaz said. I had to guess the cult was no doubt using his intelligence. “However, sometimes—rarely—the human mind will… let’s say…” he clucked his tongue. 

“Fight back.”

Loud, thudding footsteps caught me off guard.

Large wooden doors were violently thrown open, and a shadow stepped—or rather, stumbled—from pristine white light, crashing straight into me. 

The first thing I saw was the grotesque crown glued to his skull, its jagged prongs slicing into his forehead. Thick brown curls hung in soaking strands, clinging to half-lidded eyes that blinked rapidly, as if I were a hallucination. 

He was both human and not, his skin ice cold, almost slimy against mine, clammy arms immediately wrapping around me. His back was mutilated, his spine protruding through ugly flaps of flesh, festering with infection. 

The remnants of a light blue hospital gown clung to straining muscles. It was only when I really stared at him—really took him in—that I realized, my heart diving into my throat. Poppy was right. 

I could see where his crown had been forced directly into the meat of his brain, reddish sludge stained moonlight seeping down his temples. The reluctant King, I thought, my chest aching. He was still fighting. 

Rowan Beck stared at me, moonlit eyes blinking rapidly, struggling to take me in.

“Nin?” he whispered in a sob, his lips parting in a silent cry.

I opened my mouth to reply when his body jolted violently, contorting, sending him to his knees, screaming. Guards—members of the cult—were already grabbing Rowan, pulling him to his feet, and dragging him back inside.

“No.” His voice shuddered, a soft moan sharpening into a cry. He kicked and screamed, his body betraying him—weak and wrong—while his head thrashed, eyes wild. 

“Get your fucking hands off me!” he shrieked, something snapping in his expression, a feral contortion overtaking him.

His lips curled back, moonlight drowning his eyes, and in a blur, his body jerked violently, elongated teeth snapping like an animal, tearing off a guard’s head.

He was free—for maybe a second—crawling back on his hands and knees, territorial. Like a cornered animal, he backed away, eyes frantic, a low whine escaping his throat when the cult members swarmed him. 

Rowan lunged toward me, but they caught him, forcing him onto a surgical bed, his struggling wrists and ankles strapped down. 

“The King is very sick, Nin,” Kaz spoke over Rowan’s howl, once an IV drip was forced into his writhing wrist. 

He snarled, his contorting body immediately shoved onto stained pillows.

“Let me go.” he whimpered, his voice breaking, seeping into a whine when he tried to sit up, snapping at his attackers.  

Kaz stepped over the threshold, pulling me with him. 

“He currently has perforations inside his brain, which means, yes—in a way—our goddess is leaking out of him, temporarily awakening the assimilated vessel.”

“Kaz.” Rowan snarled. He was forced onto his back, his face lodged against soiled bed sheets. His body arched violently before slamming back onto the bed. 

“You're a fucking asshole, and a traitor,” he gritted out, needles and tubes being forced into him. He fought against them, razor-sharp teeth grazing the pillows. “Get a hold of yourself! You’re being controlled—mmmph mph hhhhhmm!”

Kaz nodded to me with a smile. For now, I guessed, he was King. “Keep him company—and comfortable, of course,” he said. “The King’s vessel must be in a subdued state before we reassimilate.”

Reassimilate?

Kaz’s words tangled in my mind, confusion clouding my thoughts.

I had never heard of reassimilating vessels before.

However, this was luck I wasn’t expecting—and I was going to take full advantage of it.

Once the doors were shutting on a group of guards led by Kaz, I was at Rowan’s bedside in three strides.

I knew the Rowan in front of me was a different person from the boy I had last seen.

This Rowan knew the truth about his first death and my cruel sacrifice—what I had done to him. He knew about his murder. 

I could still see that distrust sparkling in half glazed over eyes. 

He was trembling, his body still jerking left to right. 

His mouth had been cruelly taped shut, dazed eyes glaring at me.

I couldn’t stop myself, reaching out and entangling his clammy fingers with mine.

“Mmmhmm mhm Mhmmm mhmmm mpphmm?”

*Are you going to run away?*

Instead of responding, I slid the knife I’d hidden out of my pocket. “I’m going to get her out of you.”

“Mmmhmm?!”

Reaching forward, I ripped the tape off his mouth.

“Ow!” Rowan hissed. He tried to straighten up, his restraints yanking his squirming body back. “What are you talking about?”

“I was in the cult that sacrificed you,” I whispered.

He rolled his eyes. “Yes, I know that.” Rowan’s gaze was distant—still sour. “I’m still waiting on that apology, by the way.”

I couldn’t resist a dry laugh. “I’m sorry for sacrificing you to my mother’s evil cult.”

Rowan stuck out his bottom lip—a true man-child. “Whatever.”

He still didn’t look at me when I brushed sticky strands of hair from his eyes. But when his gaze finally caught mine—maybe by accident—his expression seemed to soften. He leaned closer, almost toppling off the bed.

“You killed me, and now you’re trying to fix it,” he sighed, his breath dancing across my cheek. “I don’t know if that makes you worse or just pathetic.”

I found myself paralyzed, with him so close, his eyes searching mine. His breath was warm and steady against my lips. Slowly, he leaned in, his fingers tiptoeing across my cheek, turning me toward him.

The kiss felt both right and wrong, especially since his heart belonged to someone else.

But it was warm, fleeting, sending my thoughts into a tailspin.

I pulled away when he didn’t, my breath catching.

“Sorry.”

His snort took me off guard—and I remembered he was an insufferable playboy. ""Nah. You're not sorry,"" he teased. ""You're sorry that you liked it.""

I was seriously considering taping his mouth shut again. 

Yanking up what was left of his sleeve, a shiver slipped down my spine. I could just about make out the phantom word I'd sliced under his elbow, etched into his skin. I didn't realize how cruel I was, how painful the marking scarring his flesh was. 

*Luhar*. 

Gently taking his left palm, I glimpsed *Nathur*. 

Rowan flinched when I pulled up the material of his hospital gown, revealing his heart. 

“Woah! Easy! Your hands are cold!” 

*Thalix*. 

I started with his hand, slicing the blade through the word. 

Moonlight was supposed to seep out, bleeding from the entrance point. But all that *did* pool out was buzzing static, slick on the knife and running down his palm.

Something slimy wound its way up my throat. I had known about Rowan’s ability to replicate ever since I discovered my roommate’s secret. I had watched him die in the car wreck, his body twisted like a pretzel.

Realization hit me—cruel and unforgiving—as I retracted the blade.

The severing ritual only worked when performed on the original body.

That’s what Jonas said.

And through this whole ordeal, the Rowan beside me had been nothing more than his static replica.

His shadow.

“You are funny, Nin.”

I shuffled back as he sat up on the bed, pulling his arms free from the restraints, plucking out the tubes feeding into him.

I jumped to my feet, my heart in my throat, as he dove off the bed, stretching.

The King regarded me with a curious smile, one brow raised. “Holes perforating my brain.” He mimicked Rowan’s voice.

His cruel gaze held me in place.

“That’s… naive. Even for you.”

Imogen Prairie entered the room.

“I had a feeling she would fall for it.”

Unlike the boys, she embraced her Queen status, draped in a cloak of adorned human flesh and blood sculpting her frame. Blonde streaks of hair hung in moonlit eyes, cherry lips curved into a triumphant smile. “Stupid, brainless Nin.”

“Brainless, thoughtless, everything-less.” The King studied me with amusement. He leaned forward, his breath tickling my face.

“I want to… show you something.”

He grabbed my shoulders, escorting me from the room, through a wooden door, and down cold, concrete steps. The King’s grip was unrelenting. “I'm… curious,” he murmured. “Is being so painfully thoughtless a human thing, or a *you* thing?”

I didn't respond, my body stiff, my eyes glued in front of me. 

There was a flickering orange light getting brighter and brighter. 

“Correct me if I'm wrong, but you've known about my ability—and your ability—to be copied, rendered, and molded into her perfect soldiers, with endless bodies made of static that can never be hurt, never truly die.” He hummed. 

“But you chose to turn your back and be oblivious—when really, Nin”—his fingernails were cruel, slicing into the bare flesh of my shoulder—“you should have been asking yourself why! Like, why are we replicating?” He mocked my voice. 

“Why do we keep coming back? When you had the answer all along!”

“I mean, you did *see* me. I trickled from your friend’s flesh, your blade slicing me from him. You freed me. You allowed her to pull me from the flesh and mold me.”

He smirked. “Well, that was a secondary version of me. I was the very first. The first shadow peeled from Rowan Beck’s heart.”

I caught his smile flickering in the candlelight. We descended the stairs, leading into a stone tunnel filled with candles. 

I noticed moonlight spilling across the floor, scalding my feet as I was forced into its path. But I couldn't stop myself. 

My body was hers. 

My thoughts, hers to twist. 

Cult members stood, making way for us. Mom was among them, her eyes wide, smile proud. 

I passed her, and her lips broke out into a grin. *I'm so proud of you* she mouthed, her eyes filled, twisted with lunacy. The King clung to me like I was his bride, linking our arms. “I want to introduce you to some… friends of mine,” he murmured. “They've been excited to see you again.”

Moonlight led me, and I was transfixed, almost dancing towards it. 

The room I found myself in was filled—drowned—in her. So bright, my vision burned. 

But I couldn't move my arms. She was singing in my head, gleeful, her melody echoing in my skull. 

When her light started to let up, figures bled from the blur.

I thought they were cult members at first, but they weren't standing.

Instead, three bodies were tied back to back, drifting in her light, as if preserved in her lumine. 

They were human—so painfully human—blood still staining their clothes, eternally frozen in stardust that glittered on their cheeks like diamonds beneath heavenly light. Something squirmed, coiling around my spine when the King strode over to one of them and, with the toe of his boot, rolled the body onto its back. 

I had known who they were the moment I stepped inside. But my mind didn’t fully register it until I saw the gaping cavern in his chest—where I had cruelly torn out his heart. His head lolled forward, tousled curls falling into his face.  Rowan.

Kaz’s gunshot wound stuck out, ugly and cavernous.

Imogen was still dressed in blood-soaked, fluffy pajamas, tangled blonde curls glued to her face.

But if they were here—if the original bodies of the Bolivia House residents were *here*. 

I took a step back, gooseflesh prickling across the back of my neck. 

*Where was… *I*?*

“Nythea has always been able to control and mold our second skins,” the King said. “She has bled inside our silhouettes, our outlines, twisting us into her playthings.”

His voice echoed in my head as I found myself stumbling toward my roommates.

“But…” The King continued, when I fell to my knees. I barely felt the impact.

She was already singing inside my head. Louder.

I crawled forward, and she let me, let me lay him on my lap and grasp his cheeks, cradling them. He was so cold. His skin was almost hardened, slick with moonlight.

“What if she reached further?” Behind me, the King fell to his knees next to me, almost in prayer “What if Nythea walked on this earth once more? Not as a shadow, a puppeteer, but reborn skin and bones?”

I barely felt him.

There was only her.

Singing to me from the skylight, trickling into my blood, my veins, entwining around my bones. I felt stone-cold hands press something into mine. 

I felt the blade prick my palm, and I knew exactly what I had to do. She was so soft, so gentle, coaxing my hand when it sliced through the first word.

Luhar.

This time, I saw it, reveled in it, in the trickling moonlight flowing from the wound.

“Sever her light from us,” The King’s lips found my ear as I dragged my blade through Nathur. “And let her reach them.”

Yes.

Her voice choked my mouth, her melody suffocating my throat.

“In flesh and blood, and bone,” he whispered.

Part of me was resisting. Jonas never told me about the end of the severing ritual, so I looked for it myself.

The one performing the ritual must be the exact same person who performed the binding—and as punishment for failing an offering, the one enacting the severing must be sacrificed.

So, in a way, I guess I was finally getting my karma. 

Nina’s karma. 

Still, the moon held me in a soft, and yet unbreakable grip. She had my mind, my body, my blood and bones, and, like I was dancing, unable to stop, unable to steady myself, I stabbed the blade into Thalix.

I watched his skin splinter apart, rupturing, moonlight pouring out.

And she was so beautiful.

I held out my own hands to touch her, to cup her into my palms.

“You intrigue me, Nin,” the King murmured. “You came in here as a player, and have inevitably become a pawn.” He tipped his head, curious. “But you don't look like you regret it. Which is… well, it's interesting.”

He chuckled. “Now, I'm inside your head. Your oh-so-naive thoughts. You're hoping everything will go back to normal—even in a world without you in it.”

He leaned closer, his face glitching in and out of view, unraveling as moonlight expanded around us, seeping from my roommates. “You're selfish, but you always have been. You want to believe that despite allowing her light to reach human flesh and bone, they will be alive—and maybe you're correct.”

His lips found my ear once again.

“But what exactly will they be, hmm? You can't preserve a heartless human being inside moonlight for a concerning amount of time and not expect them to be a little… wrong.”

His voice turned into a sing-song.

“But. You. Don't. Care.” He chuckled. 

“All you care about is burying your guilt— *her* guilt that lives inside you. You've always known, at the back of your mind, that you belong with us– inside the dark, where she twists us into outlines– her mockeries of human beings in the light.”

He was right.

I didn't care what state they were in– as long as they were alive.

With a knowing smile, the King flickered from existence, creeping back into the shadows.

And above me, the sky grew lighter, a painful glare taking over the moon’s glow.

The sun.

Sunlight exploded through the room, basking every corner, drowning me.

But she was already inside my head. She had already won.

I had so many questions to ask, but already, my fingers were crumbling away, bleeding into static nothingness that pooled on the ground. I waited for the moon to stitch me back up, like she always did. I was hers, after all. 

I was made up of her stars. 

I had never been Nina Lockhart. 

I was her outline— living a grieving woman’s fantasy. 

This time, the moon laughed lightly inside my head.

There was no reason to bring me back. I had served my purpose.

I had died so many times and taken advantage of each one.

Because what was going to happen when the darkness didn't spit me out? Where would I go? Would I continue, living in a stranger's shadow, or find my own peace?

Rest, child.

The moon laid me down beside my dead housemates, and I was grateful for her phantom fingers stroking through my hair.

Instead of watching myself bleed away into nothing, into stars that would twinkle out and disappear, I lay my head on Rowan’s ice-cold chest, wrapping myself around his moonlit corpse, watching the sunrise across the horizon bleeding into daylight.

And let her take me *home*.

… 

*Ba-bump.*

*Ba-bump.*

*Ba-bump.*

*Ba-bump.*

The rhythm was steady, slightly off-kilter, slamming into my skull.

I could sense every falter—the bulging, fleshy thing caught between her ribcage, pumping blood through veins—every breath that labored and heaved, slipping through slightly parted lips. 

And from them, I could smell… chocolate soaked in cigarette smoke, the scent of sex seeping from pores, and the unmistakable stink of…

Glimpsing tiny white hairs clinging to the woman’s coat, I felt myself retract slowly.

Cat.

“Um, hello?” 

The voice splintered through my thoughts, dragging me back to reality. 

“Dude, are you staring at my fucking breasts?”

Blinking rapidly, I focused on my latest customer, fashioning a smile.

“Welcome to Coffee Grounds,” I drawled. “The best grounds in town! What can I get for you?”

The woman—a freshman, maybe—curled her lip, her gaze raking me up and down. 

Patrons had been doing that a lot lately. 

Every customer stared at me like I was a freakin’ zoo attraction.

I figured I had something on my face, but no, apparently, it was just my fucking face.

“Iced coffee.” 

She leaned forward against the counter, exposing as much cleavage as possible. 

I was too busy staring at the cat hairs clinging to her coat. 

“Name?” I asked, grabbing an empty cup.

“That doesn’t matter.” Her lips curved into a smile. “What’s your name? You’re a senior, right? Do you have a girlfriend?”

I ignored her, making her drink. “Do you, by any chance, own a cat?”

She leaned back, brows furrowing. “Huh? Yeah.” She grinned. “Wait, how did you know?”

Slapping a lid on her iced coffee, I handed it over, careful not to touch her.

“Don’t own a cat,” I muttered, swiping my hands on my apron. “Cats, like, seriously fucking suck. I mean, have you seen them? They're like… overgrown rats.”

The woman backed away, scowling. “Gross.”

I... had to agree with her. 

I’d forgotten to shave, my hair was sticky and falling over my eyes, and I couldn’t smile to save my life.

I was peak sewer rat—yet somehow, every customer gave me a second glance, their eyes widening like they saw something in me that I didn’t. 

It was embarrassing having to snap them out of their weird trance; they just stood there, swaying. 

According to my colleagues, I was ‘the beacon who drew in customers’. 

I couldn't resist a grin when the girl tutted. I offered her a sarcastic wave. 

“Thanks for coming, ma’am! Have a *great* day.”

“Rowan.”

My next customer had a familiar face—overgrown sandy blonde curls tied into a ponytail and his usual scowl.

Sam Fuller stood at the front of the queue, arms folded, eyes narrowed, like a disappointed father.

Jeez. The guy looked like a divorced dad of two, with some seriously bad eye circles.

“I see you're scaring customers again.” I saw the slightest uptick in his lip that was maybe a smile. “Just an Americano, please.”

Propping my body against the counter, I settled him with a patient grin.

“Do you *ever*  sleep, Sammy?”

Sam shrugged. “I had two hours.”

“Wow,” I said. “That's almost a nap! Congratulations.”

Grabbing an empty cup, I scribbled his name. “Soo, you're stalking me at work too? That's low. Charlie's not here, bro.”

Sam didn’t even blink, his face softening. “How’re you doing, Rowan?”

""Fine."" I fixed his drink painfully slowly, screwing on the lid with deliberate care. ""Just like the last *thousand* times you asked.”

Sliding over his coffee, I casually leaned my fist on my chin.

“Is this about me and Kaz? Because I've told you, it's just like…”  I blew a raspberry. “I don't know, like a roommates thing—”

“It’s not,” he said, too quickly. 

I arched my brow. “Sounds like it *is*.”

“Rowan, can you just listen to me for, like, five seconds?”

I folded my arms. “If I *must*.”

Sam twisted around quickly, scanning the store before leaning over the counter, his eyes darkening. “It’s a full moon tonight.”

I took his cash, stuffing it in the register. “Is that seriously what you wanted to tell me?”

“Rowan, there are people who remember what happened,” he whispered. “Town Council members. They're coming after you.”

I slammed the register shut. “Well, shit,” I hissed. “That's like, seeeeeriously fucking bad.”

“Right?!” Sam whispered, his face lighting up. “Look, I know we’ve never seen eye to eye– because of the whole devil thing, but I still give a fuck about you, y’know? And I still don't know what happened! I just woke up and everything was just normal? The sun was back, and… and I couldn't find–”

I leaned forward, cutting him off. “Sam.”

He blinked. “Yes?”

“I say this with love,” I said, cradling his cheeks. “Please get psychiatric help.”

Sam’s face crumpled. He pulled away. “You think I'm fucking crazy.” 

“Because you sound like a nut job,” I managed through a gritted smile. I flashed a grin at a woman standing behind him. 

“He's an escaped asylum patient, ma’am! I've never seen this person before in my life.”

Sam looked desperate, suddenly lunging across the counter. I got a whiff of him, visceral and wrong, sending my body arching back, my limbs working against me, nails digging into my fists. He was… too close. Sam smelled like… 

like rot. 

Like he’d been sitting in a fucking grave.

""Rowan, you need to listen to me—""

“I've got *customers*, Sammy,” I said. “Thanks for reminding me that moon cycles exist.”

“Lock your doors and windows,” he whispered. “Close your curtains. Do not let her in.”

I grinned. “Gotcha, bro! I'll make sure to check under my bed for Slenderman, too.”

“Beck, I'm being serious!”

This time, I kept my distance.

“So am I.” I jerked my head towards the door. “Now shoo.”

Sam narrowed his eyes. “Okay, answer me this,” he came close, way too close for comfort, his breath tickling my cheeks. “How many roommates do you have, Rowan?”

—

That question hung heavy in my mind. 

At the end of my shift, I was cleaning tables when a looming figure startled me.

""One iced coffee, please.""

Kaz hung over me with a warm smile. He looked good—winter coat over a band tee and jeans, bedhead hair nestled under a baseball cap.

As usual, Imogen Prairie was attached to him, scowling, her blonde curls peeking from beneath a woolly hat.

Kaz was effortlessly cool, easily sliding next to me. His breath in my ear stunk of weed. “Did Sam, by any chance, pay you a visit today?”

I snorted, enjoying his amused eyes. “What do *you* think?""

“Keep away from him,” Kaz murmured. “I know he's my ex, but he's giving serious stalker vibes.”

“Aye, aye, captain.”

“I also haven't eaten,” Kaz's lips curled into a smirk, casually leaning over the evening menu. “One of *everything*, please, sir.”

I plonked down Kaz's coffee and a pre-made turkey sandwich.

“Happy?” 

He bit into it with a grin, getting mayo all over his mouth. 

“Mpph.”

Imogen was making eyes at the boba machine behind me.

I folded my arms. “No.”

She stuck out her bottom lip like a toddler, but I wasn't falling for her games. 

""I'm not making boba.” I bonked her on the head with a plastic cup. “It's almost 6 p.m.”

I did make her boba in the end. That girl was a nuisance wrapped in thrifted Prada.

I wasn't sure how I ended up at a rooftop party later that night– and still, that question wouldn't leave me alone. 

How many roommates did I have? 

I was perched on the edge of an illuminated pool, dangling my feet in warm water lapping at my toes. The pool was shaped like a dick. Because of course it was.

""Sooo, I saw you at the bar.""

The fluorescent blue was so… beautiful, like the water itself was trying to coax me in. A girl's reflection grazed the surface.

“Congratulations.” I said, scooting back a little. “You have functioning eyes.”

She laughed. “Are you here alone?”

“Nope.”

""That's too bad.” she said. “You're the first person I've met who willingly wears a trench coat to a pool party.”

I couldn't resist a snort. “It's the middle of winter,” I said, kicking my legs in the water.

""Where's your other half?""

I nodded toward the pool at Kaz and Imogen, getting seriously intimate on a beach towel, wrapped around each other.

""Ooh, I like them! They're cute!""

She was in the corner of my eye, her reflection glittering in the ripples. 

Strawberry blonde curls, a smile pricking on her lips. ""Why aren't you joining them?""

I shrugged. The reality was, I hated my body. I hated wearing swimming trunks.

Leaning back on my hands, I tilted my head, admiring the sky.

""I'd… rather fuck them privately.”

She surprised me with a snort. ""I mean, same.”

After a while of staring at the surface of the pool, I realized I was following a white light dancing across the ripples in the water. 

Watching it bounce onto a guy's glasses, and then someone's glass, igniting in a woman's eyes, I realized my head was slowly tipping back, my gaze on the sky. 

“Looking for something?” she asked. 

“Not really.” Leaning further back, I yawned. “I'm Rowan.”

When I didn't get a response, I turned to the empty spot next to me. 

Oh. 

There was nobody there. I looked twice, even twisted around and pulled my legs from the pool. 

The girl was nowhere to be seen, and from the concerned look on a guy sprawled on a pool floaty, I had been talking to the fucking pool. 

I didn’t have time to fully register where the girl had gone—before a chorus of laughing and cheering broke out. 

I jumped up. Kaz and Imogen had definitely crossed the line, and I strode over. 

Maya Carlisle, however, stepped in front of me. 

She got close. So close, I could *smell* her. Raspberry flavored liquorice, and stale coffee. When she gripped my chin, her expensive manicure cutting into my flesh, something inside me violently lurched back. 

“Under their eye.” Maya murmured, her lips curling into a smirk. 

I blinked. “Sorry, what?”

Maya didn't reply, stalking away with a one-fingered salute. 

Ignoring her, I reached my roommates. “Get dressed.” I hissed, throwing their clothes at them. ""This is why people think we're weird.” I pulled them from the rooftop, down spiraling stairs, my bare feet slapping down each stair. 

“You two are un-fucking-believable.”

Charlie Delacroix clung onto me, stumbling over his feet. ""Relax!"" Kaz’s laugh was way too spluttered to be sober. “We were just having fun!” he got close– too close– murmuring in my ear. “You should maybe join.""

“You're drunk, Kaz.”

“I am not!”

Pushing through the doors leading outside, I didn't realize I was staggering. 

""I'll call an… Uber,"" Kaz giggled, his voice slurring. ""Wait here, all right?""

""Wait."" I kept hold of his wrists, and it was the first time I felt it: this gnawing intensity for him to stay with me. Warm and real, and somehow, primal. 

It was too *light* around us, and yet it was supposed to be dark. I thought it was a streetlight, but looking up at the sky, a full moon glared down at me. 

Instead of explaining *why* I didn't want to let him go, why my fingernails clung to him, why I was overly aware of Imogen staying close,  I kissed my roommate, quickly, starving, breathless. 

Kaz pulled away, blinking rapidly. “What was *that*?”

“Okay, this…this sounds crazy,” I hissed, grabbing his hands. “Can you promise not to laugh?”

Kaz’s mouth split into a grin. “Have you been talking to the weird flat earther guy?”

“Kaz.” I hissed. 

“Rowan, he's got like, half a brain-cell!”

“No, that's not what I wanted to… to talk about.” I whispered, my voice splitting into giggles. “Kaz.” I pulled him close, and he burst out laughing, tipping his head back, full-on hyena laughing. 

“Listen to me, all right?” I didn't realize I was laughing too. But I didn't remember drinking anything. 

“Did we… have a fourth roommate?”

Kaz blinked, straightening up. “Huhhhhh?”

Before he could speak, I swallowed my words, forcing a smile. 

“Ignore me.” I clapped him on the back with a laugh.

Kaz’s lip curled into a smirk. “Ooh, or maybe you're like, seeing glimpses from another universe where we *do* have a fourth roommate?”

I knew it. 

I wasn't the only one. 

I think he knew that too, his laughing coming to a sputtering halt. 

“That's exactly what I mean!” I hissed. In the corner of my eye, Imogen was bent over, politely puking in a puddle. I turned back to Kaz, who had gone significantly pale, despite his drunken state. “It's right here,” I stabbed at my right temple. “Like, *right* here! I can see and sense and remember a fourth roommate– but it's like, I can't *see* them? Does that make sense?”

“Rowan.” His laugh was a little shaky.  “I was joking.”

I nodded, my head spinning. “Okay, just, hear me out,” I tried to smile, but Kaz was staring at me like I was fucking crazy. 

“You can feel it too.” I said. “Kaz, I saw you make four plates of oatmeal this morning!”

Kaz’s expression twisted for a moment, like he was going to listen. But I saw it. 

I saw something in his eyes go blank, all of the color bleeding from his iris. Kaz blinked, pulling his hands from mine. “I'll go… call an Uber,” he said, backing away.

Imogen followed him, the two of them disappearing into the dark.

It took me maybe half a second, standing there like an idiot, to remember I had Kaz’s phone.

I cupped my mouth. ""Charlie! You've left your phone, dumbass!”

When I was only met with silence, I threw myself into a run.

""Kaz!""

Still no response.

I got halfway down the street, glancing into a back alley.

Then—

I smelled it.

Bacon.

Maybe chicken.

Whatever it was, I could feel it, thick and heavy in the air, dripping from slimy fingers. Something inside me came apart, like a switch flipping. The stink was suddenly everywhere, drowning my senses, suffocating my nose and throat. 

My body moved before my mind could catch up, lowering itself to the ground. 

Ahead, two figures knelt over something—someone.

I didn’t know when I started to unravel, my body and mind unwinding in sync. Drool slipped past my lips. My jaw twitched, a prickling sensation tearing my lips back.

I sensed them—so close now I could practically taste them. Their reek clung to the air. Drawing closer, I saw their meal.

What they tried to hide.

I didn’t realize I was snarling until they stiffened, hands clutching raw, bloody chunks, their fingers squeezing the meat too hard, choking on slithering rivulets of scarlet. It dribbled down their chins, and still, they chewed, chittering excitedly. 

They had noticed me.

No.

They had always known I was there, sensing me the moment I stepped onto the street.

Watching them with clinical precision, I was aware of the way my head tilted, my knees bending, my body slowly lowering itself to the ground. Then—thoughts. 

Razor sharp. Slamming into me.

*That… smell.*

*So good*.

*Food*.

*Hun… gry*.

The two giggled, stuffing their faces, tearing deeper inside the body, ripping out twisted innards and offering them to me. 

Their eyes were vacant and yet illuminated, twin stars gawking at me in awe. 

High school kids—grinning, scarlet-smeared, entrails caught between their teeth. I crawled forward on my hands and knees, the woman’s blood soaking into my jeans, slick against my palms.

My mouth curled into a snarl.

The kids scurried back, revealing the body in its twisted glory—glistening innards spread like an offering across the concrete. They threw themselves to the ground, as if in prayer, bowing their heads. 

So I… could… feast.

… 

Waking up with sunlight in my face, half-hanging out of bed, I was completely naked.

The house was too quiet which meant it wasn’t even 8 a.m.

Glimpsing my reflection, I noticed my hair was longer, almost glued to my eyes, and I had a serious case of four o'clock shadow.

Throwing on a shirt and boxers, I splashed water on my face.

Downstairs, I figured I'd fix us all some breakfast.

Grabbing four plates—

No. 

Grabbing *three* plates, I danced over to the radio, stabbing it on.

It didn't turn on.

“Imogen!” I yelled. “Where did you put the Alexa again?”

There was candy in the cupboard. I didn't realize how starving I was, until I was ripping open a pack of snickers bars, unwrapping them, and stuffing them into my mouth. Jesus Christ, I was ravenous.

Pulling open the fridge, I grabbed the milk.

I took one gulp and spat it out, my stomach heaving.

“Kaz!” I shouted through a mouthful of candy. “What the fuck happened to the milk?”

I grabbed bacon instead, immediately dropping it with a hiss. 

There was noticeable fluffy mold building under the packaging.

Crouching to check the freezer, I froze.

There was a scarlet smear on the handle, red trickling from the very top drawer. 

Backing away, my stomach retracted, and I puked up the candy I'd been eating.

But I was so hungry. I ate more. And puked again.

I tried cookies, bread, and old leftovers. They all came right back up. 

And yet, my mouth watered as I tore open expired packs of chicken, stuffing veggie casserole in my mouth. 

It wanted more, but none of this was good enough– none of it itched that primal scratch in the back of my throat. 

I was bent over the sink, heaving up dry crackers, when a loud knock sounded at the door. My gaze flicked to the scarlet smear decorating the refrigerator.

Fuck. 

Without thinking, I grabbed a cloth from the sink and scrubbed at it until I was screaming. But it was everywhere—blood covered the floor, the countertop, and the table, scarlet streaks caked into the tiles.

I dropped to my knees, pulling them to my chest, forcing my head between my legs.

This was a nightmare. This wasn't fucking *real*. 

Another knock sent me into panic mode, and I slipped, falling straight on my ass. 

""Uh, just a…second!""

When I grabbed my phone, I saw the date.

February 12th.

I gagged again, this time, slimy scarlet dripping from my mouth.

No, it was January 20th.

The party was…January 19th.

My gaze slowly found the ceiling; ancient symbols scratched into the paintwork.

Trash bags covered the windows, duct-taped in place.

No. 

No, no, no, no, no, no. 

There was no way I had slept an entire fucking month.

Panic crawled up my throat, my phone slipping from my fingers.

Another knock, and Sam Fuller's last words filled my head.

“Lock your doors and windows,” he'd said. “Close your curtains. Don't let her in.”

Sam.

The guy had gone fucking insane.

""I’m— I’m coming!” I managed to choke out. “Jesus, Sammy, give me a fucking break!”

Halfway to the door, I sensed it. Gooseflesh prickled across the back of my neck, the smell prickling every nerve ending. 

*Threat*. 

Still, I yanked the door open, swallowing a twisted grunt trying to crawl up my throat. 

A cop stood on the other side.

""Rowan Beck?"" she asked, inclining her head.

 ""Uh, yeah?""

Her smile was too strained. ""Hello, my name is Andrea Carlisle. I'm here to talk to you about your missing roommates. Charlie Delacroix and Imogen Prairie? They haven’t been seen since last month.""

Suddenly, it felt like the world had been ripped from underneath my feet. 

*Ba-bump.*

*Ba-bump.*

*Ba-bump*.

*Ba-bump*.

Her voice danced around my head, pricking into my brain.

“Sweetie, are you okay?”

She glanced past me, her wide, eagle eyes scanning everything. 

""Mr Beck, I know we’ve already taken your statement, and this must be an incredibly hard time for you, but we just need to ask you a few more questions. Do you mind if I come in?"" 

Leaning forward, her head tilting slightly, she swiped her thumb across my lip.

She held it up, her index stained red.

""Ketchup,"" the cop said.

This got me deep into my seed packets, and the realization that there are some things I’m just never going to grow. So, I’d love to organize a seed swap…tomorrow.

Here are the details:

**Where**: Sonder Coffee & Tea - 2000 S. Colorado Blvd., Denver, CO 80222 (in Junction Food Hall). This is adjacent to the Colorado Station  public transit stop, and there’s a parking lot, too.

**When**: Sunday, February 16 from 9a - 12p

**What**: A garden vegetable, herb, and flower seed swap. If you have seeds that you don’t plan to use or have excess of, bring them! Or, even if you don’t have seeds but want to be part of Community, feel free to join! (And everyone should feel free to give of their excess).

**Who**: You, the person reading this. And anyone else you think would be into this.

**How**: Bring little baggies (no judgement) or  envelopes or some other type of container to take away the seeds. 

**Why**: Because gardening is a form of resilience, resistance, and helps create community! (And that’s what I need right now ☺️)

I wanted to provide an update because the previous posts on here really helped convince me to start treatment. I have always been a slightly bigger guy with a gut, but COVID really did a toll on me. I started the year at 264, my highest weight ever.  I was as low as 217 when I was working out regularly after being up to 235 or so from 2017 to 2018.  I used to walk all the time during my work breaks because I would get restless in my cubicle, but teleworking during Covid put a stop to that and my weight got a bit too much for my liking.

I got approved for the GLP-1 regimen and  I started on 1/18/24 with 12 units.  I was approved some time before that, but was hesitant to start and shipping took about 3 weeks due to a backlog. No meaningful side effects outside  of feeling fuller for longer after I eat. No nausea or anything.

I haven't changed much in terms of lifestyle because I am pretty used to only eating one major meal a day along with a morning Monster (I know its not great, but I don't drink coffee and I need some caffeine) and currently a smoothie or a cliff bar for lunch to tide me over. Historically snacking and desserts have been my downfall and those have pretty much stooped in any meaningful way.  I still feel hungry, but am not compelled to snack, if that makes sense.

I try my best to keep a proper protein intake with my meals and smoothies, but I could do better. I am planning for when I hit an eventual plateau to start working out more to help me with it, I have just been lazy about it since it has been cold in my area since my weight gear is in my garage.

Overall I lose about 3lbs a week which I am pretty stoked about and will be happy if I can continue that. Started 24 units today. Again no meaningful side effects. Optimistic about the future!",5,1739671020.0,HimsWeightloss,0,1.0,False
1iqhhh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/1iqhhh6/chargestop_ev_station_on_99st_and_whyte_ave_whats/,Chargestop EV Station on 99st and Whyte Ave. -- What's the Deal with this Place?,"Full disclosure: I'm born & raised in YEG, I love this city despite its flaws and problems. I also have an electric car, and although it literally sucks on road trips (I can barely make it to Airdrie one-way on a single charge), for my purposes of 99% city driving it works great. I charge my vehicle at home and rarely use public chargers.

So you can imagine my surprise and muted delight when I saw this establishment open in 2024, the ""Chargestop EV Station"" on 99st just south of Whyte Avenue:

[The Mysterious \\""Chargestop Station\\"" on 99st and 81 avenue NW](https://preview.redd.it/gw40va69peje1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44225f823971e469935d64dac24d38e3ac464a74)

When it opened last year, I drove past it often. ""Cool"", I thought. They've got several charging stations in the back and a modest ""shipping container"" style reception and café area where you can wait while you charge your vehicle. Probably handy for out-of-towners.

Here's the thing.

I live literally 5 minutes from this place and I drive by it almost every single day. Every time I drive by, I look around the facility. THERE ARE RARELY ANY VEHICLES THERE. Honestly, I've only ever seen one or two vehicles in the back PER WEEK. This is at all different times of the day. Very few customers.

So this really got my head scratching. How can this place possibly stay in business? The charging station installation alone, plus taxes + utilities etc. would be significant. Yet I rarely see customers here. How does it stay in business? What is this place really about?

Here's my guesses:

* It's a business subsidized from some level of government as a ""green"" energy provider or some idealistic nonsense
* It's a business operated by some well-meaning but overly idealistic entrepreneur who has deep pockets and is trying to get ahead of the (faltering) EV game?
* It's a money-laundering operation for organized crime. Not sure how that would work, but maybe it's possible.

Anyway, next time you're driving on 99st, take a look. I'll bet you a coffee there's nobody in the charging stations. Except maybe a gas-powered car belonging to the station attendant.

Any additional info or theories are welcomed!

1iqhgih,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1iqhgih/constantly_irritated_bowels/,Constantly irritated bowels,"Thought I’d share my story so far to see if anyone else is experiencing the same. I’ve read through countless accounts on here and the maddest thing is everyone is experiencing the same issue in so many different ways. I went to my doctor about this and was given the routine blood check + also tested negative for celiac disease. Once these results came back ‘normal’ according to her, even though white cell count and neutrophils were low indicating possible recent infection? - she diagnosed me with IBS, the follow up advice was ‘make some dietary changes and maybe make a food journal’. Very helpful cheers mate. I asked about SIBO testing but she told me she doesn’t do these and doesn’t know where I could get it done.

I’ve been experiencing this for around two years and think it may have started after a course of antibiotics I took for an infection. 

My diet wasn’t great before - lots of processed food, bread, dairy etc, however for the last 6 weeks I have been on a low FODMAP diet and only whole foods, high fibre, lots of sauerkraut and yogurt etc. I recently introduced lactose free & fat free dairy yoghurt - still not quite sure if this is causing symptoms. I seem to experience more diarrhoea when I have dairy, alcohol, coffee, saucy meals etc and am also constipated a lot. It is definitely a mix of diarrhoea and constipation and a lot of the time I need the toilet to pass a splash of mucus followed by constipation and being unable to pass everything. I do manage to have a somewhat decent bowel movement at least two times per day for the most part

There is definitely an improvement in my bowel habits since being on this diet but this could just be down to the fact that I am eating only clean foods etc. I definitely have it easier than a lot of people whose stories I’ve read on here but is still difficult to deal with. As long as I haven’t eaten a really bad trigger food/ drink I won’t need the toilet too urgently to the point where it stops me from going about my day. 

Stress doesn’t play much of a factor for me as I am pretty stress free. I’m also an amateur MMA fighter and train 5+ days per week. Sometimes I get to the gym feeling like I may need to go the toilet but once I start my session it goes away - maybe because my mind is occupied. I also make sure I eat a bland meal before training to minimise symptoms - green banana and white rice. 

I don’t take any medication (just some supplements and slippery elm)and don’t plan on it - thinking I can resolve the issue without these. The main issue is symptoms are so unpredictable and very hard to pinpoint triggers. Also don’t experience any pain unless I’m having really bad diarrhoea.

Long one but love to hear if anyone has had a similar experience - NHS don’t seem to be very helpful when it comes to GI problems and seem to lump everything into the ‘IBS’ category as there’s not much understanding of when it comes to this.

1iqhfbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1iqhfbm/losing_the_only_family_i_have_left_but_the_thing/,"Losing the only family I have left, but the thing that hurts me most is how I hurt my friend.","This is fairly long, and I apologize in advance. My life has felt like it's been laughably sad, but in spite of it, I have been trying my best to find peace. For the most part I have, but now it's been getting worse and needlessly complicated. Even trying to recount it all, it feels too contrived to be in a Hallmark movie.

My dad left before I was born and left me with a bipolar mess of a mother. I loved her, but there were days where she was terrifying to be around and then days where she seemed somewhat normal. I was always walking on eggshells when I was around her. But the thing that made me happy was making her laugh. Felt like it was the one thing I could do to make a difference and not feel afraid of her. But most of the time she slept all day, and that felt like my only real solace.

Eventually, my grandparents stepped in and managed to take the two of us. But I was still young and didn't know what being bipolar meant. It was only explained to me that she was sick. And in my kid mind, it just meant that eventually she would be better. So as much as I could, I'd be there for my mom, no matter how terrified I'd be of her.

It felt nice to be with my grandparents as they essentially became my parents. They weren't around much because of their jobs, and because of that I ended up being alone more than I'd like. It felt like I became institutionalized to loneliness where at first I hated it, then I got used to it, then it was the only thing that made me feel safe. Despite that, my grandparents tried to raise me in a loving environment, even with my mom present. 

Then when I was around 9, my mom just disappeared. And the terrible thing was, I was relieved. But after a year, I was anxious because the thought of her coming back was always in the back of my mind. I felt guilty that I was thinking that way, but being so young, I didn't know how to process those feelings, so I just tried to ignore them. But my grandparents gave me a lot of love and peace that I felt I was missing my whole life.

Eventually she did come back when I was 12. She didn't live with us this time, but just stayed in a hotel. I never got the details of why that was. It was a terrible experience having all that anxiety back. But I tried to just be there for my mom, visiting her, doing my best to make her laugh, but being around her, I felt like I was regressing to that sad child I used to be around her. Then after about 2 months, she passed away. Heart failure.

The horrible part is there was a great relief, and once again I felt guilty about feeling that way. I still loved her, but I was glad I didn't have to be afraid of her anymore. I started acting out in school and my friends and classmates were freaked out at me. Eventually it passed and I went on to live my life and be moderately happy. But there was a lot of other really painful lows in my life that I won't be mentioning, but I managed to make peace with after many years of self-reflection and therapy.

I moved from my hometown around 2017 to Texas and eventually settled in the PNW. My grandparents weren't too find of that, mostly because they were older and knew they would need me. It hurt to hear, but I tried to explain that I needed to be my own person a there was a lot of bad memories that came with living in that home. I wasn't sure they understood exactly, but relented. So for about 2 years, once a week, I'd call them and update them on my life. They seemed happy and proud of me.

Then around 2019, I decided to surprise my grandfather for his 80th birthday. Made it home and found out my grandmother had dementia. He never told me. I asked why and he said ""You should have been here."" It crushed me. Despite me thinking otherwise, he was still resentful of me moving. Enough to just totally keep this from me out of spite. It broke my heart to see him this way, and to know that the strongest woman I knew in my life was going through this. I felt broken. 

Even after all this, I still tried to keep in touch and mend what relationship we had, since he became essentially the only family I had left. He didn't hide his resentment since my 2019 visit and was very evident whenever I talked to him. I still loved my grandfather, as angry as I was at him. Then a few months ago when I called, his voice sounded very shallow. I asked him how he was doing and just said fine. I even asked how my grandmother was doing, then he paused for a second, then said she's doing fine too. Since then he's been avoiding my calls and I currently have no way to reach or get in contact with him. Even going home isn't feasible because I won't have the funds to fly out and get there until the end of month. Even then, I don't know the status of his or my grandmother's health. So I'm worried it'd be a waste of time and resources.

It hurts to think about, but I'm positive that he's dying and that my grandmother has already passed away. It hurts because he's the only living family member I have left and at the same time I'm so angry at him for acting this way. This intense feeling of loneliness of knowing he could be gone, but also the anger that he threw away 20 years of love because I moved has been overwhelming me. He taught me how to drive, I caught my first fish with him, he was the father I always wanted. And when he's gone I'll lose the only person on this earth I can say I love. 

On top of that, I'm currently in the process of finding a place to live and currently stuck in an apartment with an emotionally abusive/manipulative ex along with three other people. It's been terrible trying to cope with all this while another person I used to love has been silently enjoying me being miserable but still pretending to be there for me.

But prior to my grandfather's last call, I met a cool woman on Reddit, where at the time the only problem was the living situation problem. Been talking to her and hanging out together since November. Aside from that, she's been great to be around. Funny, genuine, and an actual good person with a huge heart. We've fooled around, hung out, and had some really great and sometimes emotional conversations. It's been fun being with someone who feels like a genuine friend who cares.

But ever since my grandfather's last call in January, I feel like I've been cold and distant, but at the same time trying to pretend I'm okay. I never let her in on what I'm going through with my living situation and my grandfather. She's been through a lot herself and the combination of my family situation/living situation has been eating away at me. I don't want her to seem or feel like I'm using her to cope with what I'm going through. But at the same time, I know she's feeling me being insensitive and distant. I've only told her I've just been feeling not the greatest mentally or emotionally and left it at that. I've been trying to joke more and more to cope, but it's been coming off as tasteless and forced, at least in my eyes.

It came to a head a few nights ago, when I abandoned her to talk to my friends who I've been avoiding. And it wasn't the first time it's happened. I brushed her aside and didn't even acknowledge or let her know what I was doing. The terrible part is that talk I had wasn't even worth it, because talking with my friends made me feel like shit. I told them what I was going through with my grandfather, and they sorta brushed off my feelings and were more concerned with moving a couch and telling me about the new coffee table they got.

Eventually I went back to her, and despite me being crushed, I tried to cope with a shitty joke which was out of line and hurt her feelings. I wanted to finally be vulnerable with her and tell her what I'm dealing with, but I was too afraid. She seemed okay on the surface, but could tell I really hurt her.

I tried to apologize after I got home, and she did finally tell me how terrible she felt. She hasn't talked to me since. The worst part is I made her feel the same way I've felt in relationships with others. Tossed aside, ignored, and then them acting liking it was okay to do. It hurts, and it hurts more knowing that I did that to a genuine, good-hearted person who didn't deserve it.

I've decided I'm going to take a moment to get out of my toxic apartment and find an AirBnB or hotel to stay out and try to self-reflect, figure out a course of action for what to do next, how to get in touch with my grandparents, and most importantly, try to grieve as much as I can. Something I've been avoiding. I don't want to hurt the few people I still have in my life by pretending I'm okay and inadvertently hurting them. And I don't think there's much I can do to salvage the relationship I just ruined with that great woman.

But what I do know is I need to own up to any shitty behavior as well, despite me being hurt. It's no excuse to treat the ones you care about terribly and disregard their feelings. Hopefully being alone will allow me to process things better and to think clearer. I hope others won't make my mistake and will just take the time to be honest to those you care about and yourselves. And holding all those terrible feelings won't do you any good. It's hard, but can save you a lot of heartache. It helped finally putting all my feelings down and hopefully will be a stepping stone to finding peace of mind. Hopefully I can have an update a year from now.",3,1739670754.0,GuyCry,1,1.0,False

1iqhde4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1iqhde4/to_my_ex/,To my ex,"I've been thinking about how things ended. How one day you will find someone who can love and treat you better than I could, and how that's painful to think about right now. But I've also been thinking about how I hope I can feel whole again one day, and that we both grow to become complete people, separately. 

I think I was scared of what us breaking up meant. Besides losing a relationship, I was also losing an anchor to myself, to my past; now I'm left swimming without a lifejacket and I have to figure out who I am all over again. And that's okay. But I couldn't see it at the time, and I acted out. And I'm sorry for that, but I'm sure you'll understand. 

Things are uncertain and scary, but I'm excited. I think that's the biggest gift you could've given me; you shared your confidence in me and now I'm facing a chapter of my life I will have to navigate alone with that confident voice you gave me driving me forwards. You always told me things will be ok, and that I can find my way out of any trouble, and thrive, and I have you to thank that I believe that now. 

You'll always be a part of me, but as time passes that part will shrink and the parts of myself I have cultivated will grow. But even then you'll still know me better than anyone else, until there is a someone else, even just for that brief glimpse of our lifetimes we shared.

I hope you don't hate me or resent me. I know you won't, because that's just not you. I could never resent you, as much as my friends like to talk shit as a well meaning attempt to make me feel better. You were hurt, you were flawed, but you always wanted the best for me, from the beginning to the end.

You gave me so many firsts, and so many lasts. The first time I travelled abroad without my parents, the first time decorating a flat together, the first time being able to cry in front of someone, the first time watching some of my now favourite shows, the first time feeling truly confident enough to face a room full of strangers. The last time walking your dog, cuddling on the sofa, cooking together, comforting you after a hard day, getting coffee on a sunny winter morning. I am hopeful that in hindsight I will be able to appreciate all of them equally. 

I think I'll love you forever, and right now that's uncomfortable, but I have hope that one day you will be a fond memory, my first true love but not my last. It means the world to me that somewhere, right now, you're thinking the same. ",2,1739670588.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

**Cycle summary and priorities:**



Once again, another positive cycle for us last week, with 6 new acquisitions, 3 new fortifieds and a brand new stronghold: HIP 57280, which was just fortified last week. Hopefully you're not feeling too bad about all that money you've made from it. On top of that, Tiveronisa and the Asetsi bubble in general are holding strong, despite the recent fighting. That little corner of space will always be contested, but it puts a smile on my face to see we're holding strong and still flying the Federal flag.

Not a lot else going on this week - we're focusing on consolidation this cycle, fortifying our newly acquired systems as well as key systems throughout the bubble. The Outback Steakhouse expedition continues to go strong, having now made it to Beagle Point. We have noticed a number of conflicts between certain Imperial powers, especially AD and ALD. Limani apparently had over 800K merits put into it between both sides as part of acquisition efforts. Could this be the start of an Imperial civil war?

In broader news, in celebration of Valentine's Day, FDev have put on sale just about every pink cosmetic in the store, as well as added free pink skins for all your Manticore weapons. I don't know when this sale ends, but I'd bet soon, so if you have any interest, consider grabbing them sooner rather than later.

Archer continues to move forward strongly, with another 8 systems added to their tally and getting the last of Aisling's people out of Sol's territory. Once again, the heart of the Federation belongs to the Federation.

Also, Bulb's still around, don't worry! I'm just pitching in this week to help out.

Finally, no matter what your situation, I hope you had a happy valentine's day

About 6 months ago I (26M) ended a 5 year relationship (25F) out of pity and spite. I was in a horrible head-space and had been for a while, I was neglecting our relationship and focusing on my own selfish goals and ambitions. Unfortunately in reflection I realized what was really important to me was not my desires, but it was actually her love and acceptance of me even through all my BS. I have found myself in a clearer frame of mind recently and figured out alot of my mishaps. Im not in love with the idea of her, im in love with her. Ive never been so determined about anything in my life and have never really felt this way about anyone before. All of this unfortunately has probably come too late. I did immediately regret my decision to break up, but for the wrong reasons and didnt go about trying to mend things correctly, for the first month I didnt give her enough space and was over bearing and desperate. We didnt talk much after that, however I did receive a few messages from her and a merry Christmas, of which I didn’t respond. Last week I reached out just to say hey I hope youre doing well, it was a good conversation over text, quick replies and not dry conversation. I ended with it was nice to hear from you and talk soon, which she replied the same. Today, after I week I texted her about a friend interested about where she works. Followed by some more small talk and I capped it off with asking if she would want to grab coffee or drinks just to catch up some time. She replied “Maybe. I have been really busy lately but maybe someday after work. “ Which I said would be perfect and just let me know. She said will do, have a good day and told me what she was up to for the rest of the day.

I understand I was the the toxic one, and its not a simple task to regain trust and for someone to not have the same concerns of it reverting back to toxicity. 


My question is, she definitely is looking for change and improvement in me, but im not sure if she will be able to look past what happened or slowly come around. That kills me because I know what she really means to me and what Im capable of. Do you think the “maybe” is genuine or a probable no? 

Im over analyzing everything, chasing breadcrumbs but like most heartbroken people, this all I care about. Probably not the best outlook but hey, I really do miss her and wants whats best, even if thats not me.

Summary: 

Crowley doesn’t know what he’s done to deserve this, but he’s been sentenced to a hellish torture by his conniving boss. Part of his punishment, it seems, is collaboration with a being who seems to be angelic in nature. So, of course, Crowley takes it upon himself to torment him with diabolical plans.

Or, a Human AU where Crowley and Aziraphale are teachers assigned to help plan the Tadfield Secondary School Valentine’s Day dance. Crowley thinks he’s an evil genius and Aziraphale is just happy to be there.


Excerpt:

‘Yes, I rather think I do,’ Aziraphale countered with a small smile. ‘And your actions have been quite entertaining.’

‘Not entertaining,’ Crowley growled lowly. ‘Horrifying. Day-ruining. Everything my reputation says. Every nasty thing you’ve heard about me is true. We are polar opposites. We are enemies.’

Aziraphale rested a placating hand on Crowley’s tense shoulder. ‘Okay, darling. Whatever you say. Coffee?’

Crowley accepted the offered cup of hot, black coffee with a huff.

She’s spent the time here being controlling and deep-cleaning my house and buying me things she thinks I “need”.

She keeps trying to “stock” my fridge and buy me groceries. I put my foot down and told her I can buy my own groceries. So then she goes and buys me a floor lamp and a frying pan because she says I “need” it. She threw out the old frying pan without asking, said it was “old”.

Goes and makes a huge deal with my other family members and acquires my grandfather’s old coffee table and puts it in my home because she says I “need” a coffee table in the tone of someone talking to an invalid who can’t take care of themselves or a child, instead of a 29 yr old with preferences whose home YOU'RE in. 

I’ve butted heads with her multiple times because she repeatedly moves my things around in a controlling/disapproving way, or straight throws my things away, calling it “clutter” or ""old"".

I’ve trained several LoRAs (sofas, coffee tables, floor lamps, etc.) and want to combine 5–6 of them in a single image while keeping each product’s details accurate. Right now, if I merge two or more LoRAs, the details bleed into each other and the result gets grainy—especially with higher LoRA strengths.

I’ve tried CR LoRA Stack + CR Apply LoRA Stack, but it doesn’t solve the round‑robin / sequential activation issue. According to the paper [Multi-LoRA Composition for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16843v1) each LoRA should be applied in different denoising steps to avoid blending everything at once.

Has anyone set up a dynamic scheduler (or another clever method) in ComfyUI to handle this sequential LoRA approach? I’m open to any workflow suggestions or tips on custom nodes. Thanks in advance for any guidance!

1iqh2ht,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iqh2ht,Need Help Creating a ComfyUI Workflow for Multiple LoRAs Without Bleeding/Grainy Results,"Hey everyone! I’ve trained several LoRAs (sofas, coffee tables, floor lamps, etc.) and want to combine 5–6 of them in a single image while keeping each product’s details accurate. Right now, if I merge two or more LoRAs, the details bleed into each other and the result gets grainy—especially with higher LoRA strengths.

I’ve tried CR LoRA Stack + CR Apply LoRA Stack, but it doesn’t solve the round‑robin / sequential activation issue. According to the paper [Multi-LoRA Composition for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16843v1) each LoRA should be applied in different denoising steps to avoid blending everything at once.

Has anyone set up a dynamic scheduler (or another clever method) in ComfyUI to handle this sequential LoRA approach? I’m open to any workflow suggestions or tips on custom nodes. Thanks in advance for any guidance!

1iqh23j,https://www.reddit.com/r/retailhell/comments/1iqh23j/resale_stores_are_not_for_fast_cash/,resale stores are NOT for fast cash!!!!!,"There’s hundreds of businesses where you can sell items for same day cash. Many of these stores try to aim at lower income individuals with severe discounts and marketing, but is 0% likely to purchase any items from that community. 

If you cannot afford your next meal, and you try to sell a coffee table missing two legs, the staff member will probably not pay you anything- because a trendy furniture store does not exist to reimburse you for stuff you don’t want. If you start cussing at and threatening the store staff because they CANNOT purchase it (not WONT, it’s a matter of POLICY and our JOBS) you may as well steal that meal from the store next door- equal chance you’ll be banned. (for legal reasons that’s a joke, though not like the store in my mind is gonna loose money from theft)

So why is the flair “gross” instead of customers suck? My city is facing such severe literacy issues and homelessness, I no longer expect ANY customer to understand how to shop or sell. I meet people daily who CANNOT read, can’t write, cannot do basic addition or subtraction, cannot wash clothes they sell because they have ZERO access to laundry services. This isn’t on the guest- it’s the fact these stores intentionally prey on those communities. 

My store aims to be EXTREMELY modern and trendy- new stuff only, perfect quality only. How does it advertise itself? “Sell your OLD shoes for some cash! We are ALWAYS buying! Never pay full price for name brand!” among many other details that for my job security I can’t share- zero of our policy is ever explained. No one knows we are an extremely strict reseller until PHYSICALLY IN THE STORE- often, not until they’ve already signed in stuff to sell. We’re not supposed to make this dichotomy known because “you want everyone to shop and think they have money to spend” when, in reality, a majority of my city is blatantly priced out of our brand, and/or our selling process/item needs is completely out of line for what they have or what would be accessible to them. 

I cannot buy your pants with vaginal discharge, your shoes with giant holes in the back, or your display case missing a door- my area manager would write me up for internal theft immediately (“misuse of store money”) and since WE CAN’T DO THAT FOR EVERYONE, WE NEED TO STOP SAYING WE CAN. Most customers think I’m lying to them when I explain what we seek in items because, again, you only learn how niche it is when INSIDE THE STORE. A customer with no way to call ahead who walks there, only to find out the information we publicize isn’t true? yeah, of course they’re going to yell at me dude. 

but, if you have experience with that kind of income situation- please aim for selling older items with consignment or pawn opprotunities instead, the local shops literally BUILT to make reselling accessible to those citizens (obvs not every store of that kind works that way). One is one mile down the street and would have way more info (or maybe even food or other resources) for someone unable to afford food or transit than the juniors-only fashion store or whatever. Also also I don’t know of a single consignment or resale place around here that does IMMEDIATE cash, the wait is usually hours or days, so by fast do you mean “sooner than biweekly pay?” 
Screw corp for making me touch items people haven’t washed or repaired since the nineties and for subjecting me to their (and my) panic attacks over this issue. Wash your stuff before you sell it. Duh.",1,1739669567.0,retailhell,0,0.6,False

when i was done showing her all that, i sat on the bed next to her and held her hand (we had held hands on the previous date and earlier during that date). thirty seconds later she said in a mellow voice “can i kiss you”. i pretty much died. a few minutes later (in that same voice) she said she wanted to kiss me everywhere.
at some point then it got late and i don’t have good transport connections so i suggested she stay over. we laid next to each other and she was radiating warmth and i felt like i was in a heavenly bubble.
i cannot wait to see her again, hold her hands, and kiss her, and see where that takes us:) as of now we are “nothing” because i did ask her to be my gf, but she’s unsure where life’s taking her next (currently no plans but she’s reconsidering a few things career wise and said she didn’t want to be starting something if she’s gonna move to the other side of the country in a week’s time. so that was my only bit of mild “disappointment” but i’m genuinely glad she was honest about her (personal) doubts). i’m still happy about it all though<3",0,1739669519.0,actuallesbians,1,0.5,False

My current plan is to allocate about 4,000 sq. ft. for play structures, arcade games, or AR/VR experiences, with the rest for 3 event rooms, 1 quite room for working parents, and a coffee shop seating area (not looking for full kitchen but open to suggestions). The place will be provided as empty shell. What should be budget I should be looking for. 

I’d love to hear from anyone with experience in running, designing, or managing a similar setup. Some key questions: 

**🔹 Play Equipment & Attractions** 

* What type of play structures or attractions work best for engagement and repeat customers?

* What is current market trend for equipment.

**🔹 Buildout & Costs** 

* How much did your buildout cost, and what were the biggest expenses? 
* Any unexpected costs I should plan for? 
* Any must-have features that improve customer experience?

* What’s the ideal staff size for a space like this? 
* Any tips on finding and training reliable employees? 
* What’s the biggest staffing challenge in running a play center or arcade? 

**🔹 Kitchen & Café Setup** 

* What kind of food & drinks work best in a family entertainment setting? 
* Should I focus on a limited menu (coffee, snacks, pre-packaged items) or invest in a full kitchen? 
* Any insights on licensing, equipment, or layout for a small café inside the facility? 
* If I go for full size kitchen, I am worried that cost would definitely escalate. Any suggestions. 

**🔹 Business Model & Marketing** 

* Membership vs. pay-per-play: What works best? 
* Any key challenges in day-to-day operations? 
* What marketing strategies helped you attract customers and keep them coming back?

So, in June of 2024, a girl randomly started following me on Instagram. Since we had people in common, and she was from the same area (biology) I accepted and followed back.

In July she posted something related to my area of study (she was taking classes with my advisor) and I replied to the story, making fun of the mistakes she made. From there we started talking a lot, like daily, and almost every hour. We spoke for like, one month and in August 9th she came to my house, and we met personally for the first time ever. Since then, she started going to my house every weekend, or at least 2 times per week. We saw each other almost daily in the university, we were talking a lot and developing something.

Keep in mind, this girl is 20 years old and broke up with her ex in June, which I did not know.

I told her that I couldn't, for personal reasons (insecurities about my past relationship) and because of my doctorate proposal was going to be in another state, because there was no Phd in my area at the university I was studying at. And due to that, I couldn't get into a relationship with her, and she understood that. Nevertheless, we kept together. Being there for each other.

In september, she looked at my whatsapp without my consent while I was taking a shower, and saw a convo I had with my bestfriend about Tinder (We were only dating for 1 month, and still developing stuff. So we were single, and both of us knew that). I forgave her for invading my privacy, but in the end I was the one to blame, according to her. According to her, I couldn't be doing that, I couldn't be talking about other girls or comparing people. But still, she should not have done that, but I forgave her anyway.

We had some more disagreements, due to my ex presence in my life (We have 2 cats we adopted together during out 7 year relationship, so we keep in touch due to them, and that's it, keep in mind we broke up 2 years ago and never once thought of getting back together).

I've always been transparent about the amicable relation I had with my ex, and showed no intents whatsoever of getting back to her. But still, Katarina (fake name for the girl I was dating) always got mad about her, for different reasons and I ALWAYS kept her secure about it. Always showed the messages if she wanted, I was always there for her and her insecurities.

By the end of November, the Phd proposal for my university went through, and I was going to be able to stay in the university for the next 4 years. And I was considering asking her to be my girlfriend. But I still had some doubts.

In December, she got a little bit distant, claiming it was her routine keeping her away. End of semester, gym, Xmas presentations (She is a dancer in a dancing company, so lots of rehearsals). This triggered me, because when I broke up with my ex, she used the same ""excuse"".

My dog died, I was getting tired, I had lots of stuff going on and she didn't, even once, come to see me or make a little effort to spend time with me, and this made my head go towards of a spiral of insecurities. Last time I saw her in December was 8th. At December 21th, she went out with her aunt (according to her) to a cafe. But before going there, she came by my house and spent 15minutes with me to show that ""everything was okay between us""

I got anxious, and asked a old friend of mine to go out with me, so I could catch my breath and talk about life and everything. I tried to tell her that I was going out, but she didn't reply my message. After a while, at almost midnight she sent me a furious message saying ""You could've at least told me you were going out, instead of me finding out on your instagram"" and I said ""I tried. You didn't answer me"".

She started getting angry, and discussing with me (Keep in mind, the cafe was in the same neighborhood I was at. And my city is kind of small, it wouldn't be too hard to bump into her there).

I got mad, went to a party with this friend. And there, a girl kissed me. At first I kissed back (I was single, still) and disliked it, a lot. It made me feel so bad, like I was betraying Katarina. I stopped it, and went home. At home, I told her nothing had happened, because her day was going to be long and tiresome, and I didn't want to tell her online, I wanted it to be personal. But I couldn't, she ""fought"" with me again because of me not warning her I was going out.

I tried to ask her to come by, or if I could meet her, but she said her day was too busy for that. I waited her to come home at night, and told her everything.

She was pissed and sad, saying that she was there for me for 4 months, and I had to kiss someone else to realize I wanted only her, and I understand it sucks. I understand I was a piece of shit. She called many things, said LYING was something she could not ever forgive, for no reason. That she would never lie to me and everything.

She came by my house to talk with me on December 24th. Her initial motive was ending everything, but she said she loved me like no other, and even though it was going to be hard, she wanted to try and stay with me.

My dad started feeling ill, and got hospitalized by December 26th to January 2nd. So I was feeling stressed, spending almost 24 hours per day in the hospital. And Katarina kept talking with me, we met at December 30th to take both of my cats to my ex (she was going to help me), and spent the rest of the afternoon at the beach, together.

She sent me lots of loving messages at Xmas, while she was a little bit tipsy. Sent me lots of messages venting about her love, and how it hurts the whole situation during these days by the end of the year.

At 31th, she had a New Years evee party to go, that I was going with her. But due to my dad's situation, I couldn't. She spent the whole day talking with me, and when she went to the party, radio silence, because I was going to sleep anyway. I woke up at 8 AM, and she was texting me, because she just got home and was saying nothing happened, that she was fine and loved me, and we talked a bit before her went to sleep.

She came to my home at Januray 4th, and I realized her ex was following her again, in both of her instagram accounts (private and public one), not even I was following her at the private account (She gave me the unfollow hammer after I kissed the girl)

And I asked her about it, because she told me many times that she didn't have a good relation with any of her exes. (She had 3 relationships before me, and this last one lasted for 1 year, 10 months. And they broke up once during this period, twice if you count the end).

She got a little weird, and told me he sent her a message in middle of December, asking for forgiveness for everything wrong he had done, and he didn't want to have a bad relation with her and everything. And she forgave him (It was very weird, but I couldn't do anything. I wasn't allowed to distrust her word now).

On January 6th, I went to the university and a friend of mine that saw her on the party she went, told me she was walking around holding hands with a man, blond and taller than me (I knew for sure it was her ex. Matched the description).

I asked her about this mysterious guy, and she told me it was only a friend of hers. Walking with her to protect her from other dudes, I didn't question it, but I didn't believe her.

On January 6th, by the noon, she insisted on taking my parents, aunt and uncle to a cafe and a museum. Told me she really wanted for them to come, and spend time with me and my family.

We went to those places, but she was weird. She wasn't feeling like herself, not even for a bit.

We had a conversation on our way back, and she told my inumerous times that nothing was wrong, everything was fine, and apologized for everything. I knew something was off, but I kept my mouth shut. I left the car without saying anything, or even kissing her.

She started sending me messages 20mins later, saying that my reaction made her remember of her past, that she didn't like it, that everything still hurts her, that she didn't believe I was able to lie to her and everything (Even if I lied for only 15hrs, trying to preserve her fucking day. I know I was wrong by lying but still, I had a great reason to)

We ended up taking a break, for a week (or at least I thought it was going to take that long).

Next day, I was scrolling my instagram, and saw a post of another friend in the same party. It was a video, and in the back of the video, there was her. There was Katarina, kissing a guy that 99% was her ex.

I sent her the proofs, and told her ""Good to know everything was not working out, and it was not even my fault""

She started the whole talk of:

""I'm sorry""

""Your pain doesn't cancel out mine""

Things like that. Like I was the one to blame for her lying, for everything. I started asking questions, and she told me it was a random guy, that she didn't even knew if the name was Ricardo or Rafael. But I didn't buy this crap, not even for a bit.

We stopped talking. Next day (January 8th) she sent me a message by the morning, asking if I was alone at home, and if she could stop by after work to talk with me. I allowed it.

We had a emotional conversation about what happened, and she again, vowed it was not her ex. I didn't believe her. Still, we had sex, and after 5hrs there she went home.

She also told me she was going with her aunt to an Inn in another city near hours in the weekend.

And if the place was nice, she wanted to take me there.

On january 9th, I started venting, just like she did many times before with me, after I fucked everything up.

And she basically told me ""Nothing that I tell you makes you chill. It's getting tiresome for me""

And after that, I just shutted my mouth. I felt horrible. I couldn't believe she was not allowing me to do the same thing she did with me

Guess what? I discovered she went to the Inn with her ex. There he asked her to be his girlfriend, and she accepted at first, but thought it was going too fast (That's what she said, BUT I don't believe this even for a bit, because the guy (Her ex, now actual boyfriend) kept wearing a ring on his finger since this day)

She came back at January 11th, and by the night (When she was not with him anymore) she started sending me lots and lots of messages. Asking how I was, if everything was ok. I was not feeling like it, just said ""Yes, everything is ok. Thank you"" and gave her a little bit of the silent treatment, because I had nothing to say.

She started playing games. Blocking me, unfollowing me, sending me shade using her twitter account.

But after a couple days I gave in, and started talking again. I wanted her, I really wanted her back.

But I also knew we had to take a time for each other, break apart a little, for our own good.

At January 18th we were, once more, saying our goodbyes. And she went to a party with her ""ex"", even posted some story with him (Occulting her story from me, so I couldn't see it)

At January 19th, I posted a picture with A FREAKING FRIEND, and she sent me a message on whatsapp with the following:

""Please, don't ever talk to me again. Forget everything we had""

And I just said, what the hell? Why are you doing this?

And she said ""Please. Just don't talk to me""

And I started questioning her, asking if she was jealous, and why the fuck she was, she had no right to do that. And after a while debating, she came to her senses and asked for forgiveness, that she got mad and acted impulsively, because I told her I was not going out with anyone for a while, because that's who I am when I need to recover from a broken heart, and that I lied to her about that. But it was only, just a friend in the picture. We stopped talking, and on monday, 20th of January, she saw me at the university and sent me a message. Saying I was looking so beautiful with the fresh haircut and everything And we started talking, and then she came near me, and we spent 3 hours together After that, she went home because she had stuff to do. I went back to my lab, and she promptly sent me a message as soon as I got there.

""I didn't have to come home, my mother did the stuff she wanted me to do. Sadly, I could've spend more time with you. Are you going to be in the university later?""

I told her ""Yes, but there's people in my lab. If you want, I can pick up a key to another room where no one will bother us""

She agreed to that, we went to that room and started talking, then hugging, then kissing, and we fucked. Both of us went home after this little adventure, and she sent me lots of messages, saying that she wanted to grab a coffee with me, that she wanted to do it again and everything.

I agreed to that, and on tuesday (January 21th) we did the same. On January 22th, I knew the situation was not great, and told her we needed to end everything, because her ex was far more involved in her life than she would like to admit (They were in a freaking relationship for sure, but she always told me they werent, that she was only enjoying knowing this new person he said he become, and c'mon. Dude is 22 years old, spent 5 months away from her, he didn't change for crap and all of us know that, but I'm not the one that's going to tell her)

She said things like:

""I'm losing one of the most important things for me""

""You know, deep down I'll always be yours""

""My door is never closed for you""

""I'll never get over you""

And we ""broke up"". On Friday, January 24th, she sent me lots of messages. At least 30, and before I read them, she deleted it. I asked what that was about, and she said she was just venting, and I asked ""About what?"" And she sent me 4 printscreens of the conversation. She deleted them for dramatic points. And it was about a subject we already discussed, and there was no reason for her to be approaching that.

We stopped talking again. On saturday she asnwered a story of mine, which I just replied dryly. And on monday (27th), she asnwered another one, and I thanked her for what she said. And the she asked if I was doing ok, if everything was fine, and I just said ""Yes, you?"" and she said ""Yes"" and I just liked it.

I saw her twitter, and minutes after my like, she posted something like ""This is so shitty"". And I knew she was feeling down due to my coldness, and I, being the imbecile that I am, started another conversation with her. She suddenly was back into good spirits.

And in the next day, we bumped into each other at the university, started talking and spend the next 3 hours together, talking about us, about the need of staying away from each other, about her ex being more than just her ex, even tho she wasn't addmiting it.

By the end of the afternoon, I saw the occulted again her stories from me. Of course she did, she posted a January dump, which one of the photos was of her ex with her.

And I immediately unfollowed her, and made her unfollow me. After 40 minutes she asked why, and I kindly told her ""I can't stay near you. I can't keep seeing your stuff, I don't need you to protect me from the negative feelings I must feel."", basically. And she understood that I needed the distance, told me she loved a lot, and we stopped talking.

Untill Monday, 3rd of February. I was feeling way better about the whole situation, but she once more bumped with me at the university. I saw her face, and I dind't recognize the emotion, if it was sadness, hate, despise... I just noded at her while she passed by waving at me. I felt so bad, so sad, so anxious.

Later that day, she saw my stories, and after that posted on twitter ""Still shitty...""

And then on tuesday 5th, she saw them again (I was posting a picture with my bestfriend, which she knows who is and knows it's only my bestfriend), and then blocked me on instagram and posted on twitter ""It just stopped being important"". She unblocked me on Thursday 7th, and I blocked her. This past Monday, 10th, she posted on Twitter ""He only has age, because maturity he is lacking"". And I sent her a message, explaining WHY I blocked her. Why my profile is now private, and that the distance was going to be needed for me. And I blocked her only to stop seeing her stuff

And she told me that I make her doubt her decisions, because everything is fine, and then I talk with her and her feelings get back, she keeps thinking she is in love with me, but she can't stay with me. That everything is confusing for her. And after 3hrs of talking, we said our goodbyes, ONCE FUCKING MORE.

And then on Wednesday, 12th, she sent me a new message. Saying she had to vent. Said she loved me a lot, but she couldn't stay with me. She was afraid of hurting more people, afraid of making bad decisions, and that everything sucked. That she only wanted us to work out, and couldn't be able to make it work and bla bla bla. Even told me that not even her ex gets her wet as I did, and she thinks no one will be able to do the same I did for her.

Being such a natural lover, being so empathetic with her feelings, giving her reassurances, being easy to love. Things like that.

She even sent me semi-nudes of her beach marks. She said many things, that if her boyfriend took a look, he would be definitely devasted.

Anyway, we said our goodbyes, for one last time. And she basically told me that hopes someone makes me happy one day, that I don't deserve anything she did with me, that she feels so fucking sorry for everything she done, that she didn't want me to leave the country (Because it's one of my plans), because of thinking of me being away destroys her, because right now I'm near, she can bump into me, see that I'm doing fine, and also told me she will never stop having affection for me.

And guess what? Today she blocked me on instagram, because she didn't want me to see she posted a picture of ""Show your valentine"" with her ex.

So. That's it, a long read.

But now I feel like checking her social media 24/7. I can't stop myself, even tho she played me and it's not a good person for me. People say that lying is her personality, but I really like to think she is a good person that made bad deicisions, but maybe that's just my love trying to still defend and justify her actions...

What can I do to get better? I feel like I'm stuck in place.",1,1739669403.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1iqgyoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Keyboard/comments/1iqgyoe/looking_for_help_on_the_best_keyboards_for/,Looking for help on the best keyboards for quickly typing words (U.S.),"I'm looking for recommendations based on my needs after I spilled coffee on my mechanical keyboard this morning (Corsair K70 Cherry MX tactile red switches). My brother got it for me about nine years ago, so I don't know anything else.

I'm a journalist, and I've found it's a trillion times faster to transcribe my interviews by typing them out than to edit the mind-boggling amount of errors that AI transcription results in. I can currently touch type at 100 wpm with 100 percent accuracy (based on my understanding of touch typing, anyway. I just learned what touch typing is today while researching keyboards. I very rarely—if ever—need to look at the keys when I type and all of my keycaps are blanks, so if that is touch typing, I can touch type).

Anyway, I want a keyboard that facilitates the fastest possible typing so that I can less frequently pause the audio track to catch up when transcribing. Accuracy is less important than speed (wow, I can't believe I just wrote that. I've always preached the opposite, haha) since it's more efficient to go back and correct the occasional typo than to pause the audio track to catch up.

I'd like to keep the price under $150.

**What it must have**

* Ability to switch out the keycaps. I don't care what type of keycaps come with the board.
* Facilitates the fastest typing (are tactile switches the best type of switches for speed?)
* Not black. Ideally white, but I'll settle for anything but a black board.

**What it should have**

* Programmable keys? I've read some boards can be programmed, does this include changing the keys to render a different letter or symbol? I'd love to be able to replace the caps locks key (AKA THE SCREAMING KEY) to render the em dash (—), the \^ to render a left smart quotation mark (” not ""), the & to render a right smart quotation mark (“ not ""), etc.
   * **If this is possible, then I don't need a board with a 10-key number pad**, which is how I currently render these symbols (e.g. alt+0151 for —).
   * Rendering punctuation marks such as the above is the only thing I used the 10-key pad for, however I use it for this purpose a million times a day, **so if it's not possible, then I need a 10-key pad.**

**What I could care less about**

* Switching out the switches. I could see this being beneficial, but I'm not sure if I would use this feature—maybe—but probably not.

**What I couldn't care less about**

* Wireless connectivity. I will **always** have it plugged in.
* Loudness. I live alone and WFH.

Thank you very much to anyone willing to provide guidance. I did research on this earlier this afternoon, but everything I read either didn't address my needs or was too vaguely/poorly written to give me confidence.",1,1739669257.0,Keyboard,1,1.0,False

I’ve trained several LoRAs (sofas, coffee tables, floor lamps, etc.) and want to combine 5–6 of them in a single image while keeping each product’s details accurate. Right now, if I merge two or more LoRAs, the details bleed into each other and the result gets grainy—especially with higher LoRA strengths.

I’ve tried CR LoRA Stack + CR Apply LoRA Stack, but it doesn’t solve the round‑robin / sequential activation issue. According to the paper [Multi-LoRA Composition for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16843v1) each LoRA should be applied in different denoising steps to avoid blending everything at once.

Has anyone set up a dynamic scheduler (or another clever method) in ComfyUI to handle this sequential LoRA approach? I’m open to any workflow suggestions or tips on custom nodes. Thanks in advance for any guidance!

Day 1: we landed around 3pm. 

Got bags and car \*budget car rental line was LONG. We waited about 1.5 hrs to get our car. We were chillin’ but lots of angry ppl in line. 

Went to Costco to load up. There is a national shortage of eggs. We got some big bags of chips and popcorn, 2 boxes of soda water drinks, a large fresh caught pacific cod, macadamia nuts and some local snacks. I tried to pick things that were local to the island as much as possible.

First meal was at the tin roof. We got the spicy chicken sandwich. We didn’t really like it tbh. It’s very very heavy and too much fried butter and mayo. I’d recommend getting one of their rice tins instead. 

Check in and relax 

Day 2

* Waihe ridge trail hike- Tip: drive all the way up to the top parking lot or you’ll be walking an extra 30 mins uphill pavement. I’d say it was Moderate difficulty. Took about 1.5 hrs. 6.8 km. Lots of beautiful view points. 
* kahana beach. A beautiful oasis. We went swimming and saw turtles popping up. Very chill beach w bathrooms and showers. Seems like a locals spot not too touristy. 
* Drove home to watch the sunset at Kihei Kamole beach park 2 

Day 3: Snorkel at Honolua Bay 

Beautiful drive along the coast w lots of great spots to stop and lookout 

Park on the side of the road at a bend and enter the most beautiful jungle walk into the bay (about 5 mins walk). The bay is all large rocks. No sandy beach. Snorkeling was ok. Lots of beautiful fish and coral but visibility wasn’t perfect the day we went.

Watch the sunset at Kihei kamole beach park 2. Whales put on a sunset show. 

Day 4:

Surf rentals from Maui wave riders. Surfed all day a the cove in Kihei. The perfect place for beginners. Maui wave riders are so nice. We parked in their lot and just walked over to the beach it’s right there. They gave us reef booties which are a must. 

For lunch we went to sweet hula in the Kihei gardens for açai bowls. A hidden oasis. Truly beautiful place w awesome food, coffee, live music and shops. We went back here a bunch to chill and break from the heat/beach.

Watch the sunset at Kihei kamole beach park 2. Whales put on a sunset show again 😀

Day 5

Haleakala! We drove out around noon and stopped at kahana beach again. 

Then made our way to Haleakala park. We hiked a bit of the sliding sands crater trail. It was a bit tough to breath up there and our legs were tired! The crater view is quite breath taking. 

We made it to summit for the sunset. It was really beautiful. Very cool to be up there. But a long drive up. Glad we did it but I wouldn’t do it again. One of those once you’ve seen it, you’ve seen it. 

Day 6

REST DAY 

Went for a run in the morning to Wailea shops and hung around Kihei Kamole beach 

Kihei cafe for lunch. It was okay.

At night went for a walk out towards Wailea  Beach, such a beautiful evening spent out on the beach. 



Day 6 

Breakfast from ""thats a wrap""  Highly recommend!! delicious, healthy and fresh food. I got a protein smoothie and my husband got a smoked salmon wrap. 

Mountain biking in Makawao Forest Reserve. Rented full suspension bikes from Krank Cycles in Makawao. Rode Pineapple Express. Highly recommend!! Best trail ever. 

Dinner in Paia at the fish market got ono and mahi mahi 

Day 7 

Makena beach— stunning beach with HUGE waves. The water was so clear and the sand was so soft. No rocks or seaweed. 

Headed to the airport around 1pm. 



What I would do next time:

* PACK LESS. All you need is flip flops, a cover up,  bikinis and 1-2 work out clothes, a simple comfy outfit to wear in the heat (shorts and tank) I did not need a bra or make up or dresses 
* Book a snorkel tour to [*Molokini Crate*r](https://bossfrog.com/maui/snorkel-map/molokini-crater/). You will need a boat to get there. 
* Check out the southern eastern tip- Hana. We did not make our way out here. 
* Maybe do road to Hana? I just don’t like spending time in the car! 

If any one has any questions about the trip, write it in the thread!

It was a very active trip and I still feel theres SO much more to explore on this island.

So since this past December, I've been attempting to get a Homestar Runner themed destroy and capture mission approved for a beloved, local shopping center. See attached images for the portals in question.  


This has been an ongoing struggle,  
When I submit the mission with a trogdor themed mission icon, I get ""This is copywrited material"".  
When I submit the mission with *all of the portals in the shopping center*, I get ""Business owner is trying to promote business."" -   
When I submit the mission with an Ingress themed Mission icon, I get ""The mission title/description is too vague"" - ***when I clearly have labeled this mission as capture and destroy, how much more obvious can you get?***   
***What is Niantic trying to protect in this shopping center?!***

I've grown up in this area and have been visiting this shopping center since I was a kid and I want to share it with others.

Authors note:  
First, an apology! The last chapter and ending of Planet Dirt was... well, not good, I admit it. I missed the mark. It got me to where I wanted to be, but the execution was lacking. So, when it goes into book format, that chapter will be rewritten into three chapters.  >!The outcome will be the same: Adam loses the case due to the judge, but ultimately, he will win. I’m not going to “Empire strikes back” and have him lose completely; just very close to it. The deaths will be the same. Anyway, I decided to continue the story instead of stopping to fix chapter 30, which gives the book reader something extra to look forward to.!<

And as always, if you see any mistakes let me know so I can correct them. I appreciate all the help. As some of you know, I have both dyslexia and ADHD, and I am not a native English speaker.  


With that said, let's begin Book 3, Colony Dirt. Only one book remains after this.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



  
Adam didn’t know how to start the day as he lay in bed. After the morning routine, he had a colony to deal with, a whole colony. Erath had sent three colony ships. And they had forgotten to tell him they had upgraded the ships, and now they each carried 750,000 people. So he had just gotten 2.25 million people from the Earth domain. How the hell did that happen? All the cities, including Hades, filled up quickly. Not all of these new people were humans, and that didn’t even include those who already lived here. He just stared at the ceiling; beside him, Evelyn slept. How she could sleep with all of this going on was beyond him.

He decided he could at least get up. He could go outside and get some fresh air, and watch the sunrise. He was sure it would rise soon.  Sisi was lying on her pillow, looking at him. She didn’t move, but he knew she was watching everything in the house.  Beast woke up and looked between him and the bed, then followed him through the door.  Adam went to the kitchen, got a cup of coffee, and then went outside, only to find Sisi waiting for him there. Adam smiled and looked up. He could see the two moons locked in an eternal dance. He remember that when he first read the description of the planet and the moons, he had thought the moon had been split into half, but that was not it. He was looking at the three-body problem in reality, and it worked. Jork had put sensors up there, and if they felt out of sync, then they had about an hour to fix it.   Besides that, the night sky was dark, filled with stars and a weak white path. He realized something and looked at the watch.

3.48 AM

 He had not slept more than a few hours, but then he looked at the coffee in his hand and sighed. No point in going to bed again.  He took another sip and walked inside and into his office. He might as well work and find out what they had done while he was preoccupied with the trial. Roks had told him that the judge had been working overtime, and they were still going over what damage she had done. She had freed Jargy Mutt and his pirates when she had taken control of the judicial system for the trial. In fact, she had emptied the prison, and a shuttle dropped in and took them away. When Sig-San found out, he had tracked it to the Conitava system, where he found the surviving members of the Lainran pirates and a few other pirates and slavers. They seemed to join in a conclave, and their main goal was to take out Adam. Adam read the report and then got the information of the Canitava system. It was part of Busker Union, and their biggest company was the Mapat megacorporation, which was part of the Mugga Corps conclave.

Their main product was food production, and they used lots of slaves.  He needed to turn them; he could not outcompete them. Mapat had several planets that only produced food, so he had to cut their workforce to make them more profitable with the need for fewer workers. He would have to ask Jork to work with his own farmers to find ways to solve that problem. 

He would have to tell Kira that Jargy Mutt was free and put a reward on his head. 

Vorts and Jork had been working with some engineers and managed to make an atmospheric shield that could be set at about 500 meters above ground, and they could raise it as the nitrogen level rose. It would take them five months to complete the current resources. They needed more personnel and equipment, which he now had in abundance.  He just needed to talk to John Mo about it.  

Then, there was the matter of the aftermath of the trial. Mr Knug said sales had gone through the roof, as had a request to move to Dirt. According to him, he would expect Dirt to have a population of 10 million within a year.  Apparently, city buildings will be the main focus for the coming years. He looked at the number in shock, then stopped himself. 10 million was not many for a planet the size of Earth. There were cities with 10 million. Hell, Mars City alone had 50 million.  Adam's problem was that his current city was built for around a million at most.  He opened the city building program and checked the designs; there were three megacities there, too big. But he found a few for a population of 1 to 3 million; he could even expand New Macao, connect it with another, sprawl it out. He started to work on it.

 

Evelyn kissed his neck, and he turned to see her holding a cup of juice. “Did you sleep?”  He shook his head. She took his hand and then led him back to bed. You go rest now, and I will make sure those instructions are filled out. “She smiled at him. “This feels like Déjà vu, no not déjà vu.“

 Adam smiled, “Okay, I tend to get a little too lost in my projects.” He yawned. “Have Kork and Vorts contact John Mo about it and Have Roks and Sig-San make a plan about those pirates… “He yawned again as she led him back into bed as the sun rose.

“Sleep now. I will take care of it. You need your rest for dinner tonight.” She kissed him and let him sleep. Sisi was already sleeping on her pillow.

 

Adam woke up around 12 and started his routine. Then, he went to look for Evelyn, but she was not in the house. The maid informed her she had left for Piridas and the shuttle was ready to take him there.  Adam let Beast out and told the maid to let him in before the dark. Then he went to the shuttle. When he arrived, he was met by Roks, who grinned. “So, how’s freedom? You guys have a messed up judicial system, how come that judge hasn’t been executed yet?” He said and Adam laughed.

“We rarely execute prisoners, only for high treason.”

“And piracy.” Roks said and Adam shook his head. “Nope, that one was me executing Federation law. I’m just glad that was not brought up. They might have gotten me on murder.”

“You're such a bad criminal. You switch between the laws that suits you. Are you sure you’re not a Lawyer?” They both grinned and started to walk inside. Adam noticed there were a lot more guards and droids.

“Why the heightened security? “ Adam said and Roks winked.

“Look at the uniforms.”

Adam looked; they were not Marines but had the Wrangler security tags. “They are mine. Your brother suggested it, and I agreed.  Have I told you you're quite alike? He is perhaps a little softer and doubts himself more.” Roks said, and Adam just smiled. John Mo was never close to them, the one he had grown up with was perhaps like his siblings in his mind. John Mo was the odd cousin they all knew about but never really spent time with, but he had always done what he could for them. When they reached the administration, it was filled with people. It felt weird; there were so many activities; he had been barred from the Administration for little over a week, and yet the change was extreme. He walked into the office with Roks and they called up the mr Knug.

“Yes, sir? Enjoying your freedom?” He said with a smile and Adam chuckled.

“Yeah, I have a job for you. Work with Arus and hire somebody to deal with immigration and settlements. You guys are going to be too busy with trade and media to deal with that. I went over your numbers last night, and you're correct. That court just made Dirt very attractive for everybody who wanted to free their slaves earlier, and a sudden increase of people will bring more commerce.”  He replied.

Mr Knug seemed to be thinking about then slowly agreed. “I think I know a few, I’ll send you the details. They should already be at Dirt.”

It took Adam a few seconds to realize this, and then he sighed. “Let’s hope they are happy with what we did then.”

After the call, Adam looked at Roks and said, “So the two Admirals want to have a wargame. I want you to set it up for them and use one of the empty systems nearby. But we need defense here, so make sure we are not defenseless.”

“Aww. I kinda wanted to join.”  Roks said and Adam chuckled.

“Ask if you can go after the winner.”

“That’s not a bad idea. Hell, we can easily buy up the five nearby systems, they are just asteroid fields I think one has a lifeless planet, worse than Dirt. And use them for official war games.”

Adam snapped his finger. “That’s right. Nobody buys those places, but it would be perfect for war games and mining. Hell, imagine getting a nation to resolve war through war games. They get a month to fight inside the system to decide the winner with pre-set rules and agreed-upon victory conditions and prizes. Hell we can get people to bet on the outcome as well.”

“Did you just make war a peaceful gambling game?” Roks said as he got out two glasses of whiskey.

“Why not? They get to play laser tag or whatever, and nobody dies. It will also give people a clear idea of who is the top dog, so if they do come for you, you know exactly what you are facing. Now, we only need to introduce a set of universal rules for warfare and get everybody to sign it.”

“Just out of stupid curiosity to your insane ideas, why?”

“Simply, you get everybody to agree to pre-set rules, and if anybody breaks them, we all unite against them. Nobody in this sector would survive if ten of the nations got together to attack them, not even if the Haran and Tufons joined forces. There are just too many.” Adam said.

“Humanity did in the Butcher war.” Roks countered.

“We already have these rules and were not alone in the Butcher war. Humanity might be strong, but even we have limits.” Adam said.

“Well, you are the only species that now has colonies in both the north and south parts of the galaxy. We have no idea about how big your empire is.”

That made Adam laugh, and he took the whiskey glass. “Humanity is not an empire. We are thousands of nations who agree on a set of rules and have a joint galactic force we call the Marines. John Mo belongs to a different nation than me.”

“I thought humanity was united under one rule; you all seem to be unified.”

Adam almost burst out laughing at the thought. “Do you want to know why humanity is so good at war?  It’s because we can't go a decade without some internal war, The Marines are mostly doing police work, keeping some nations as far apart from each other as possible, and we go to war for so many stupid reasons that the United Council looks forward to the next alien invasion, just to the humanity will for five god damn minutes stop fighting each other and united to fight somebody different.”

Roks smirked slightly and Adam just knew what he would bring up.

“Well, it looks like you guys need Galius as much as the rest of the galaxy. He is a chaos walker who brings peace, "" he said, winking, and then emptied his glass.

1iqgv30,https://www.reddit.com/r/wizardposting/comments/1iqgv30/a_thousand_small_moments/,A Thousand Small Moments,"Maria still remembered the day she met Vincent like it was yesterday. It wasn’t a particularly grand or fated meeting—no dramatic coincidences, no earth-shattering realization that this was the man she would marry. No, it was something much smaller, much quieter.  

She had been working at a bakery in the city, a modest little shop nestled between towering guild halls and alchemy supply stores. Most of her customers were wizards, people who paid with coins that shimmered too brightly, people who rarely looked her in the eyes as they left in a rush, too caught up in their own important, magical lives. She wasn’t bitter about it. Not really.  

Then, one afternoon, Vincent walked in.  

It was raining. He shook the water from his coat as he stepped inside, pausing at the doorway to breathe in the warm scent of fresh bread. His hair stuck to his forehead, and he looked utterly exhausted, but when he met Maria’s eyes, he smiled. Really smiled.  

“Got anything left?” he asked, glancing at the nearly empty display case.  

“Just a few loaves,” Maria replied, already reaching for one. “Nothing fancy.”  

“Perfect. I’ll take the least fancy one you’ve got.”  

That made her laugh. She didn’t realize until later how rare that was for her back then—how much she had been simply existing, getting through each day without much thought beyond the next shift, the next paycheck, the next round of rent. But something about Vincent felt different. He stayed to chat as she wrapped up his bread, cracking dry jokes about the wizards who ran the world, about how people like them were little more than background characters in someone else’s grand story.  

“We’re the audience,” he had said, grinning as he leaned against the counter. “Watching all their explosions and lightning bolts from the sidelines, hoping we don’t get caught in the crossfire.”  

Maria found herself smiling along with him.  

Vincent came back the next day. And the next. At first, he always bought something—a loaf of bread, a sweetroll if he was feeling indulgent—but eventually, he started coming just to see her. To talk.  

They learned they had grown up in similar circumstances—families scraping by, watching the world change around them in ways they couldn’t control. They laughed about how neither of them had ever so much as lit a candle with magic, how out of place they felt in a city built for people who could warp reality with a flick of the wrist.  

“I like it, though,” Vincent had admitted one night, as they walked home together after her shift. “Being normal, I mean. It makes the little things feel bigger. More important.”  

Maria had thought about that for a long time.  
  
  
  
They married in the spring, three years later. It was a small ceremony—just them, a handful of friends, and a tired priest who had seen more magical duels than weddings in his lifetime. They couldn’t afford an extravagant venue, but Maria didn’t care. They found a quiet garden on the outskirts of the city, filled with wildflowers and stone benches weathered by time. Vincent had dressed in his best (which wasn’t much), and Maria had worn a simple white dress she had sewn herself, the stitches uneven in places but made with love.  

“I’d marry you a thousand times over,” Vincent whispered as they exchanged vows.  

She squeezed his hands, trying not to cry.  
  
  
  
Their life together was simple. Happy. They moved into a tiny apartment above an old tailor’s shop, where the walls were thin, and the floors creaked no matter how careful you were. It was unbearably hot in the summer, freezing in the winter, but it was theirs.  

Maria would wake first, slipping out of bed to start the kettle, while Vincent buried himself under the blankets, grumbling about the sun being an enemy to all mankind. He’d join her eventually, still half-asleep, pressing a kiss to her temple before settling across from her at the rickety kitchen table. They would talk about their plans for the day—Maria’s shifts at the bakery, Vincent’s odd jobs fixing whatever machinery needed fixing. They were never rich, never even particularly comfortable, but they made do.  

Vincent had a way of making even the dullest moments feel like an adventure. He would turn washing dishes into a grand performance, flicking soap suds at Maria until she threatened to dump an entire bucket of water on his head. He’d hum tunelessly as they walked through the market, making up ridiculous backstories for the people they passed—The fruit vendor? Secretly a retired assassin. The old woman with the cane? Former queen of a lost kingdom.  

Maria laughed more with him than she ever had before.  

And when times were hard—when rent loomed too close, when Maria’s hands ached from kneading dough, when Vincent came home with another rejection because “this job requires magical proficiency”—they had each other. That was enough.  
  
  
  
When they found the Little Lamplight, it felt like a miracle.  

A place that asked for almost nothing in return, that didn’t care that they were magicless, that offered them a home when they had nowhere else to go. Maria had been skeptical at first, but Vincent had convinced her. “It’s too good to be true,” she had said.  

“For once, maybe we don’t have to question it,” Vincent had replied, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. “Maybe we just take the win.”  

So they did.  

For the first time in years, they had stability. A home that didn’t shake when the wind howled, food that wasn’t rationed to the last scrap. Maria found herself allowing hope to creep in, daring to think that maybe—just maybe—this could be their future.  

She would wake to Vincent’s arms wrapped around her, his heartbeat steady against her back. She would hear him mumbling about breakfast before rolling out of bed with exaggerated reluctance. They would eat together, sip coffee together, exist together.  

And Maria thought: this is enough. This is everything.  
  
  
  
But life had a way of shifting when you least expected it.  

And the last thing Maria ever expected was to find herself waking up in that same bed, reaching for Vincent, only to find nothing but empty sheets.  ",10,1739668937.0,wizardposting,11,0.92,False

The first fracture was comparable to a hairline crack in porcelain: thin and easily missed. Once it spreads and begins to chip and break away at the surface, it becomes unavoidable. Its reality forever changed.

\---

""No. I'm telling you, we didn't receive it! I didn't lose an entire months worth of coffee at the bottom of the ocean!""

{SYSTEM RESPONSE} ""THE DELIVERY HAS BEEN CONFIRMED. ALL ITEMS IN SHIPMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON ARRIVAL.""

""And what happens if something *didn't* arrive?""

""ALL ITEMS IN SHIPMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON ARRIVAL.""

""Yes I—"" Reeve clawed his hand down his face, grasping at his cheeks and eyelids. ""On arrival there was something missing from the shipment, the shipment itself *arrived*, not all of the provisions did.""

""THERE ARE NO DISCREPANCIES IN THE SHIPMENT RECORDS. IF YOU BELIEVE AN ITEM IS MISSING, PLEASE VERIFY THE RECEIVED SUPPLIES.""

“I did. It’s not there.""

""IF AN ITEM IS NOT PRESENT, IT WAS NOT PART OF THE SHIPMENT MANIFEST.""

""It **WAS** requested and it **IS** part of the shipping manifest! Just check your damn records of the shipment!""

""ALL ITEMS IN SHIPMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON ARRIVAL.""

Reeve sat still for moment, rigid, tense. The words from the automated system were entirely flat and indifferent. ""Are you even keeping track of what is going missing?""

""LOCALIZED FRACTURES REMAIN WITHIN OPERATION THRESHOLDS, AND ALL ITEMS IN SHIPMENTS ARE ACCO—""

Reeve interjected, ""I'll take that as a no.""

""YOUR CONCERN HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED. NO RESOLUTION IS NECESSARY. GOODBYE.""

He stood there still for a moment, frozen in disbelief. The communicator remained firmly gripped in his hand as though he hadn't decided if he was going to try again, to make them understand the gravity of the situation. His head panned towards the far wall where storage shelves lined the walls of the room. The shipments were always reliable and arrived exactly as expected. There were small discrepancies here and there—which were reported promptly, but nothing like this. What were a bunch of sleep deprived scientists and bio-engineers supposed to do without coffee? What was *he* supposed to do?

Some time ago, a Keystone team was dispatched to this facility to crack a hole in the surface of reality: a deliberate, ‘reliable’ shortcut. As per the protocol set in place, they performed their staged assessments, nodding at instruments they barely understood before attempting to break reality like a fumbling glass worker with a screwdriver. The problem with glass, of course, is that cracks don’t always stop where you expect them to.

The Keystone had always been vague on the details of how their system worked, but the basics were well understood: a new kind of shipping. One that bypassed borders, weather and distance itself. A modern marvel in supply chains, engineering, physics and consumerism; Keystone Direct. Packages and shipments didn't travel in space, they passed through a fracture and reappeared at a different location with the use of a targeted tethering device. In practice, it was a large electromagnetic rod shot into the fracture that attached to the retrieval node to be dragged back into existence with the same grace as hauling a tire from a lake with a fishing line.

Reeve wasn’t an inventory manager in the traditional sense, but you’d be hard-pressed to get him to describe his job as anything else. As far as he was concerned, his role was to track shipments, log the equipment, and ensure that the entire operation ran smoothly. The way the shipment arrived was irrelevant to him; and the research conducted at the facility could very well have been studying how paint dry.

He stomped over to his desk to sit and begin methodically arranging all the new paperwork. His general organization was the key to his routine, and unlike the world around him, his routine is something he could always rely on. The ice shifted around them, with massive formations melting over time and filling nearby trenches. Thermal vents boiled and volcanoes spewed into the surrounding ocean. The area they were in was not stable in the least, but until today, his routine was. Although a simple thing to most people, it was clear that the idea of no longer enjoying his morning coffee and the break in his routine was a heavy, personal loss to him.

While he remained silent, his intent was in his body language, and his thoughts written all over his face. Much like his own checklists, Reeve had begun to go through the stages of grief in the same manner he dealt with most things, even subconsciously he held to his process: verify, double-check, move on.

*DENIAL* 🗹

Surely it had to be there.

Smaller items missing are forgivable, they are easy to pass off as general human error: but an entire supply cycle of coffee?

He picked up the clipboard again. If it were missing from the shipment it would have been noted. Someone would have flagged it, the system would have flagged it. If there were a straw to grasp he would be holding on for dear life.

There wasn't.

*ANGER* 🗹

The clipboard came down hard against his desk, the sound echoing through the sterile air of the supply room.

How could they forget to ship it? The Keystone knew the station relied on these supplies, they weren't going to be able to put in another requisition for a month. The funding behind this project was already bleeding money at this point and didn't allow for unscheduled expenditures. No exceptions, which meant no coffee for a month.

He, along with the scientists and engineers would be at each others throats in under a week. They are already in a confined space, running on erratic sleep schedules, none of them kept regular work hours. This was essentially like taking the spark out of an engine and expecting their caffeine dependent brains to jump-start on sheer force of will.

*BARGAINING* 🗹

Reeve stood quickly and started towards the common area with clear mission: to procure any stashed away coffee and take stock of the situation. It wasn't normal for his counts to be wrong but it doesn't hurt to see if someone had a stash, deliberate or forgotten.

He targeted the corner shelf where people haphazardly threw things they had opened when their minds were too preoccupied to remember where it went. Old protein bars, a half-eaten and partially crushed bag of crackers, raisins dried out so long that they could easily be mistaken for pebbles.

Finally, there was hope in the back corner of the pantry, tucked behind some nondescript bags and shining like a glint in a gold pan—a coffee tin.

Reeve reached toward it...

*DEPRESSION* 🗹

...chamomile. Some disturbed individual thought it was reasonable to stuff chamomile tea into an old coffee container. It would be easy to pass this off as a misery-fueled delusion, but sure enough, there on the tin was the word 'Tisane' written in smudged marker.

His fingers drummed against the metal.

Coffee was fuel, momentum. Steeped flowers, at least this kind, were for people who welcomed things as they were during moments of quiet contemplation. They weren’t for someone staring down a month-long caffeine drought with the crushing understanding of what this truly meant: devastation.

The most recent example is the [Guatemala La Esperanza](https://fellowproducts.com/blogs/brew-talks/fellows-take-on-guatemala-la-esperanza-by-linea-brew-guide) roasted by Linea.

It’s gotten gradually better as I’ve gone coarser, and finally today, all the way up at 6.1, I’m getting the candied citrus clear as day with a lovely, creamy finish. Nice and sweet, no astringency at all.

1iqgt7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1iqgt7k/im_letting_my_friend_destroy_her_life/,I'm letting my friend destroy her life.,"I (39F) have been friends with ""Annie"" for 15 years. We met through work, but we quickly bonded over our mutual love of science fiction and fantasy. We're the same age, and we were both single. Even when she moved to a different country, we kept in touch. 

Annie had her first psychotic break 10 years ago. It wasn't obvious at first. We thought she was just being more Annie than usual. But then she returned home unexpectedly, needing a place to live. I agreed to let her use the futon. Over the next few days, Annie quit her job but kept spending money, bringing new 'friends' over that she'd met on the bus, and just behaving more and more erratically. I questioned it, urged her to see a doctor, and worked with her family trying to figure out what was going on. 

I was there the first time she was committed. She'd caused a scene in a fast food joint, and she called me for a ride. But not before the police got involved. When I got there, the police were trying to convince her to talk to the nice behavioral health professionals from the facility next door. She wouldn't go unless I went with her. I listened to her spout the most insane, paranoid stuff I've ever heard. I guess I wasn't reacting enough, because she started threatening to kill herself so people would take her seriously.

Suffice to say, she was involuntarily committed. Thus began the 10-year journey we've been on. 

Annie has cycles. She experiences mania, ends up either in jail or a mental health facility, experiences deep depression for months, her meds get adjusted, and she comes out the other side mostly stable, but definitely worse off. 

Our friendship has definitely cooled. She gets mean when she's manic, and she will use anything she knows about you against you. I had to move once because she knew where the spare key was hidden. We'll meet up for coffee occasionally and talk on the phone, but I don't tell her anything about my life now. It's almost entirely about keeping track of her movements now. 

We're on cycle seven or eight now. I've lost count, because frankly, I can't handle it anymore. I know when it's coming because she will start calling me 3-4 times a day. Once that stops, there's no reasoning with her. I let her mom know, we try to get her to voluntarily commit herself, but that hardly ever works. 

This time, she got her husband (who she met on cycle five or six at one of the facilities) arrested for domestic violence. I believe him when he says it didn't happen. But the arrest still happened. She's spent any money she had managed to save up, including getting scammed out of $1000 while trying to bail her husband out of jail. And she's now 'engaged' to someone else. I don't know where she met this one. 

All I can do is watch. It's easy, because she blasts her manic phase all over social media. But part of me doesn't even want to do that anymore. One of these days, she'll go too far, meet the wrong person, or just finally do what she's been threatening to do from the moment they dragged her screaming away from me.

I am a poor ex-academic, and I want some more money, but want to be as legally safe about it as possible.

I wanted to try taking a stab at the business of AI-assisted social media model/influencer and farm engagement for some side money, pretending to be an attractive woman in her 20s. The main purpose of the account would be to promote some sort of creative not-AI stuff that I've been doing for a hobby for a fair amount of time, and the AI-generated influencer would be a sort of a ""front woman"" for the account, being the attractive face for marketing purposes. I would put my own face out there, but I am a guy and am also very camera shy. If I had been rich, I would just hire a real woman part time to pose for photos instead. **So don't think of this as AI-generated content, but human-generated content with a little amount of AI-assisted enhancement to make it easier on the eyes.**

I imagine my income sources to be:

 - X for engagement

 - Ko-fi or Buy me a Coffee for monetary tips

 - Much later down the road, paid sponsorships on Instagram and others

It is the tips and donations that I am currently worried about. 

 - Would it be considered accepting donations under false pretense and thus illegal for me to accept tips while using an AI generated person instead of my own photo for social media activities, even if I state clearly that the tips will be used for my own gains and continuing the creative work rather than for donation to any charity?

 - If someone can somehow prove that they would have not given me money if they knew I were a man, could that be a legal basis for finding me guilty? How is this affected if I also post ""thirst trap"" photos of the AI-generated woman, such as swimsuit photos (even if sexual things are not the focus of the account)?

 - If not criminal, could it still be brought to a civil court?

I am in my 30’s, I didn’t have too good of a relationship with my parents as a teenager, but working through therapy and moving to a different country really has helped, and now I have morning coffee with my mother every morning over video call. I also call her when I get off of work and talk to her on my walk home, mostly so she knows I am okay. Another part is that I really enjoy talking to my parents now that I’m older, they’re hilarious, and if I didn’t talk to them, I have no one else I really want to talk to that often. I consider it a pretty healthy relationship. 

Now. My ex. We have become friends again but recently she has been saying my mother and I have a co-dependent relationship, that talking to her every day is too much, and that I “have” to separate from her. Otherwise it will become a “Grey Gardens” situation. I am beginning to see why we broke up in the first place. My parents are very important to me and they are getting older. My ex doesn’t have a very good relationship with her mother so I have no idea if that has anything to do with it. She says she doesn’t know anyone who calls their parents twice a day (keep in mind I am also living, and have been living in another country 6,000 miles away for 11 years.) She says it’s not healthy. My mother also called her own parents every day until they passed, so I don’t have much to compare to other than what my ex says…

A chilling mix of historical fiction and horror, The Terror reimagines the doomed Franklin expedition, where two British ships become trapped in Arctic ice. As supplies run low and the elements grow harsher, the crew realizes they may not be alone—something is hunting them in the frozen dark. A gripping tale of survival, mystery, and the supernatural, this book is sure to spark an exciting discussion!

Next Meetup: Saturday, March 29th | 11 AM | Local Good Coffee in Plano

1iqgklp,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1iqgklp/confrontation/,Confrontation,"Context: I met this mom at my daughter's daycare when my daughter was two. We were in there for a year until we got into public school. My daughter got along really well with her son so I made the effort to keep that friendship going strong, but today, my daughter is 5, I'm looking to not try so hard to foster that relationship after watching how this kid is being raised and my difficult relationship with his mom. 

After spending some time with her, it didn't take long to figure out that she has a drinking problem, but I was able to look past it since the only times we would hang out were during ""non-drinking"" hours and with both kids together.. At least I thought she was sober. 

OK so I had to brush off the fact that she's sneaking prosecco in her coffee cup now while we're out with the kids, but my daughter and her son are so tight! Ugh... 

No one's perfect and she's got a shitty marriage.. Trying to give her the benefit of the doubt, but I could no longer ignore it when she started hitting me with passive aggressive and straight up aggressive comments towards me. But.. Pick your battles, I don't say anything. 

One day she comes up to me and says she thinks she may have a drinking problem and wants to take a break or work on ""managing"" it. I make the mistake of saying, ""I'm so happy to hear that, this is wonderful news. It's never a bad thing to take a break. On that note, I've been wanting to tell you for a while now that I always know when you're drinking because you get really mean once the alcohol hits you and I was getting ready to move away from our friendship for being too toxic and dangerous."" She told me she's been hearing the same thing from her other friends and family and apologizes for acting that way towards me and will do better. 

I don't hear from her for a month which didn't bother me since she's doing her recovery and we weren't exactly super close ourselves yet to really cross that boundary in my reaching out even though I told her I was here if she ever needed someone to talk to, after telling her I have my own experience in dealing with alcoholics and addicts.. 

When we reconnected she made a comment saying she was mad at me for saying that to her because she thought it was rude of me to say even though I tried to deliver it as nicely as possible. 

Something I've learned in my experience with her is I can never come forward with how I feel if she's said something that hurts my feelings or has offended me, but TODAY, I had enough. 

(Side note, I had a baby 8 months ago. The first three months was the worst post partum depression I've ever experienced. I went through all things. Saying I was a wreck is an understatement, but suddenly it got better and I'm able to breathe again. I still get hit with a rush of intense flood of emotions every now and then, but it's nowhere near as bad as it used to be).

Today, I invite her and her son over for lunch and a play date. First thing she did when she came in was hit on my husband. I started to question whether she had a crush because she talks about how good looking he is and NEVER validates me whenever I'm venting about my problems I have with him. I never talked about marital stuff, but sometimes it can slip. 

While I'm cooking lunch and our kids are playing I see her pull out the prosecco and shortly after come the comments. She's saying a story, it's the same story I've heard a million times already. She never remembers the same ten stories she tells me. I ask a question and out of her mouth is, ""you don't know what that is? Have you ever worked a day in your life?"" (I'm a chef, worked in Michelin star restaurants for years) ok, brush it off... (I haven't worked since this new baby because he has health issues. When we met I was a working single mom. Now I'm happily married with second child). Next comment, ""you know you probably get emotional because you're weak. I never got emotional when I was pregnant"" I was telling her about my fluctuating hormones and how hard it is to regulate sometimes, especially with a 5 yr old and baby. Ok, fuck you, but brushing it off we have the whole afternoon together... Then she says, ""You just need to try harder because it's really not a big deal."" This was in response to trying to manage the household. She's only got one kid and doesn't quite understand how much your life changes when you add another child.

ANYWAY, if you made it this far, I very much appreciate you. At that last comment, I just turned around and said, ""Can you please show me a little more empathy and respect? All I here is, ""me, me, me and not a single ounce of compassion."" She flips out and tries to flip the script telling me I'm being rude for confronting her. Her excuse is, ""this is my personality. If you don't like my personality, how are we even friends? It's just a joke"" I try to explain every joke is at my expense and it's getting old. I've been questioning why we are friends now all night because I would never put up with this behavior from my long-time friendships and I am not at all desperate for friends. I think it's just a mom thing because she's the only mom I know and I've tried fostering our relationship because our kids get along. I try to explain that it's been years of comments like this. She asks me to point out every scenario, I don't fall for that trap and tell her to that I just can't take it anymore. 

I start to cry REALLY hard like uncontrollably and then she starts to cry because well, I guess she can't stand being confronted. I'm so embarrassed, but I stuff it now and I am somehow now cheering her up, serve her lobster with orzo and try to get her out, but she won't leave.

It's an AWKWARD few hours and I finally get her out the door. We end the night on ""good terms,"" but I know I don't want to continue this anymore. It's extremely toxic and my daughter has nicer friends she could spend more time with. Her son is becoming more and more unhinged as he gets older. 

I don't know what I'm trying to accomplish with this post. I'm venting, but also curious to hear if other parents have put themselves in this kind of predicament. I'm still very vulnerable being a new mom again. I'm trying to end this friendship and I feel like ghosting would be too hurtful, even though she's had it coming, I don't want bad karma on my hands. I'm also conflicted and feel like I'm overreacting because I am still hormonal?? She does lovebomb me from time to time which is causing me to feel conflicted. Would love some advice on how to walk away. Do I send a text? We've known each other now almost three years. When I confronted her tonight she was extremely patronizing and condescending. Did not hear a word I was trying to get through to her. Interrupted, talking at me, was not available to receive anything which is why I had to deflect then take care of her feelings when she then began to cry. 

It's making me feel pathetic now after writing this all out and seeing how I made myself a punching bag for someone I don't REALLY know.

 2 years later it started to back up again. We have gotten to the point where we have to set a timer to catch it draining and start and stop the washing machine 5-8 times before it drains  fully.

I have tried Augering it myself and I can’t get past the first trap from the washing machine but I can from the sink. That typically helps for a few weeks but then it rite back to overflow.

We don’t put coffee grinds or food down our sink, we basically wash out dishes before putting them in the dishwasher.

It’s getting very frustrating.

Ex-roommate moved out in mid-August of 2024. He sent a message to our roommate chat telling everyone what items he was taking and what items he was leaving. He basically said ""I am not taking these items with me, but they are mine."" He vacated the premise but never attempted to remove his name from the lease. I suspect this was on purpose. Our roommate agreement also detailed who was paying what amount of rent for which rooms, and we changed those numbers when the Ex-roommate moved out. We agreed that the now empty room would be a storage room akin to the laundry room. Our roommate agreement did not cover a situation in which one person gets effectively gets two rooms or a personal storage room.

When he left the property behind, I was the one who maintained most of the property that was left in common areas (cleaning the couch covers, wiping down coffee table, cleaning entertainment stand, etc). None of the other two roommates really use any of the property and stay in their rooms most of the day. Other smaller items were left in the Ex-roommates old room. I would say that I am effectively in possession of the property. No one else has attempted to claim it through words or action, though I have not made an official verbal claim either.  I am planning to send him a 30 days notice to pick up his items.

My two questions are: Can the Ex-roommate give his property to one of the other roommates so that he can keep using this rental as a storage unit? If the Ex-roommate can transfer his property penalty free to one of the other roommates, could I take one of the remaining roommates to small claims court if they refuse to pay rent for an additional room?

While there is a part of me that thinks the idea of having a machine that is similar to what I used back when I worked at a Starbucks, the idea of being able to let a machine do most of the things is insanely appealing, particularly since my husband doesn’t necessarily want to have a learning curve with a machine.  I know there are several machines that do things automatically and I’m overwhelmed by the choices.  I understand that by having separate equipment it makes for a more minor repair if something stops working but I’m not sure that I want to consider that now.

My Carrier furnace does not seem to power on. Usually there’s an LED that’s either flashing a code that tells me what the problem is, or it’s simply on without flashing to indicate everything is working as expected. In my case, there’s no LED code.

The sticker on the furnace cover says if the LED code is continuous off, “*Check for 115VAC at* ***L1*** *and* ***L2***, *and* ***24VAC*** *at* ***SEC-1*** *and* ***SEC-2***”

I believe this is referring to the control board, and it’s instructing me to check if there’s electricity running through these things. I ordered a multimeter and will read up on how to do this safely, but I’m curious about what the range of possible outcomes are and what the next steps would be for each. Is it correct to assume that there are 2^(4) = 16 different possibilities (see table below) given that there are 4 things to check, which either work as expected or not? Can anyone help me understand which outcomes are easiest to resolve?

**Important context**

* My furnace stopped working after a bad storm with strong winds and heavy rain. My power was out for 2 days after hearing a bunch of popping sounds. A handful of other appliances like my coffee machine and hot water dispenser totally broke and smelled like burned rubber.

**Carrier furnace details**

* **Model number**: `58STX070---16112`
* **Series**: `6`
* **Control board**: `CEBD431012-22A`

**Other things I’ve already tried**

* The power switch next to the furnace has a 20 amp screw-in fuse. This was blown out, but I replaced it with a brand new one.
* The switch inside the furnace itself is switched to the “ON” position
* There was a tiny 3 amp fuse that I replaced with a brand new one - not sure if it was broken, but I’m hoping it doesn’t do any harm to replace it since I have a bunch

Hey everyone! Starting my Master of Finance at UNSW Business School this year and looking to connect with fellow master’s students—whether it’s for coffee, campus rants, or just figuring out where to get the best cheap eats. Don’t know many people here yet, so if you’re around, let’s link up!

I change my diet I no longer drink sodas, sugary coffee, juice, frozen meals, fried foods, etc. I started exercising as much as I can with a baby and I lost 12 pounds in one month. I have never drank and I have fixed my vitamin deficiencies as well. I don’t understand what I did wrong because I got blood work yesterday at the hepatoligist and my AST was 69 and my ALT was 111.

We are literally down for pretty much anything and will have a car, so we can travel out a bit if it's worth the trip. 

A few of us also like to cook- so I'm curious if there are any farmers markets or seafood markets that we should make a point to visit? I appreciate anything you have to suggest! Thanks! ",0,1739667114.0,florida,2,0.43,False

there's someone next to me who I definitely remember from somewhere. they have a familiar posture, a bunch of stuff all around them, they even eat and drink in a familiar way.

my practicum served the local community so I don't remember if I've seen them around there or here. I love reconnecting with locals and regulars at this coffee shop so now idk what to do. err on the side of caution ofc but I don't think a single prof ever covered 'hey what happens if you accidentally approach a clt bc they look familiar' or even 'just ignore everyone that looks familiar from now on.'

We met in the most unconventional way. Was it just a coincidence or more? You reached out to me with a simple Hi or Hey and then it all began. We chatted non-stop for months, even late into the night when I know I should have been sleeping. Seeing messages from you brightened by day and hearing your voice made it even better! 

Originally, all of our similarities weirded me out but as time went on I actually started to like how similar we were. No one likes a warm pillow, right lol. 

Our first time meeting was like an awkward high school moment but every coffee/car date after that just got better. I knew you could never be mine but that wasn’t going to stop me from liking how you looked at me with that sparkle in your eyes, the way you made me laugh and most of all the way I felt so at ease in your presence. I hadn’t felt that in such a long time, if ever. 

Thank you for bringing so much laughter, calmness, trust, safety and joy into my life at a time when I didn't know I needed it. I enjoyed the time we spent together chatting, getting to know each other (at least I can say I got to know you lol) and having those coffee/car dates. 

I know we are no longer in contact because I just disappeared, but I had my reasons. I could have taken the high road and told you I was leaving but I didn’t think it was going to matter to you. 

I’m penning this letter hoping you’ll see it and for you to know I appreciated our time together OR to help me feel better about just walking away. Maybe both. Either way, my last words to you back in December were “is it weird that I miss you?”. Is it? 

On a side note, Congratulations to your Eagles! Did you think about me during that game since they were playing my Chiefs ❤️💛

I just got back from the store, and I caught a couple of snowflakes on my tongue.  Made me thing how cute couply it would be to do together 💚 catch a snowflake each, spin you around and kiss you quickly, and hope our tongues share the snowflakes we caught 🔥💙😘

Also, just walking down the street, and always looking forward to our first COFFEE DATE 🧡 which brought me another idea for a date.  Not just a coffee date, but a day full of coffee dates.  There's easily half a dozen places we can go have coffee within walking distance of here.

As for night, I'm going to eat quick, finish my devotional, and lovely melody you good night, and do our music for the day.  That should about be the rest of my night.
