1ocyi71,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ocyi71/observatory_13_part_1/,Observatory 13 (Part 1),"A/N: I'm fairly certain its gonna get rejected from nosleep but yknow I'm kind of proud of it. I figured I'd share with one of my favorite communities to be a part of. 

Anyway, this is the first sort of story I've written like this so constructive criticism is welcome! This first part is a lot of world building so bear with me. 


-------------

If you're reading this, then I'm dead. There it is. Right at the top. Jenko you slimy fuck I know you're reading this. You're not gonna get the chance to pull the trigger. 

Mom, Dad, Casey, Chris...I'm sorry. You told me not to take any contracting work once I got out of the Marines.  Since this is being sent out, I guess you were right. 

You guys always did right by me. I'm sorry I'm never gonna get a chance to return the favor. 

The following is not exactly a journal, it's more a collection of notes and anecdotes. Not the most organized, but this is important to get out. 

---------

Time sort of blends together here, one day into the next, day after day...shift after shift. It's exhausting. 

This journal should hopefully keep me sane. Maybe? Hopefully. 

I'm also just very fucking bored.  This isn't something I'm ever gonna be able to share but- maybe I'm just trying to organize my thoughts. Trying to make sense of what's happened so far

We're Observatory 13, out of...I have no idea how many. Observing what you may ask? 

I also have no real idea. It's been described to me as a rift between our reality and another, by someone with way more degrees than me. It's a sinkhole of sorts, emanating a soft orange glow. It's got a real sharp line, between it and the ground itself. Like a chunk of the earth was just sort of deleted. Or replaced. Over time the people running the observatories had built staircases and observation platforms, before finally building the observatories. They're 
essentially...imagine if someone took a space station and just slapped it onto the side of this sheer cliff face. A row of compact habitat modules, arranged jutting out  about a hundred feet from the cliff. At the center of them is Control, where the scientists watch their cameras and sensors. 

If you look through the windows you can kind of see Observatory 14 and Observatory 12 if you squint through the fog. There's always fog. These thick hell colored clouds that smell like moss and churned earth. 
Part of why we're here is to ensure nothing comes out of the pit. The other part is to monitor the weirdness associated with it. 

Its like radiation kind of.  An area of effect where the world gets weird. It was hard adjusting at first, but you work anywhere long enough you get to used to a places quirks. Plus the pay is really fucking good. 

Sure the walls bleed sometimes, sometimes there's an extra person in the station that wasn't there before, and occasionally you hear a voice outside desperately begging to be let in. Sometimes you have the absolute scariest moments of your entire life. 

But my mom's  house is completely paid for so it balances out.

 I'm a simple guy. 

So today, I was walking down the access stairs to the station taking my usual descent. They're rickety as hell, bolted into the rock face above a fall that would have probably taken days. If there is a bottom to the Pit at all. I was running a mental check as I walked, ensuring that I had everything.  Rifle, duffel bag, survival gear.
It's not exactly a trip I ever want to make more than I have to. The fog is bad today, it's risen higher than I've seen it before. Almost to the edge of the Pit. 

It smells different today. More...rotten. 

I descended the stairs to the airlock, stepping into the outer hatch and closing the door behind me. It sealed with a pneumatic hiss. The intercom crackled as I entered my access code. 

""Coffee is already waiting for you."" A cheerful voice said. Sasha, one of our medics. She was a corpsman back in the Navy, so we tend to give each other a lot of shit. 

""You're chipper."" I muttered, entering my code. 

""Another glorious day in the Observatory my dear Jarhead."" She singsonged. Crews tend to stick together for ease of scheduling. The people you work with your first shift tend to be the ones you're stuck with for your entire time here. 

My crew isn't all that bad at least. There are three security officers, all ex military. A medic(Sasha), and three researchers. I finished typing in my code and the inner door swung open with a creak of bulky metal hinges. Once I got in, I sealed the inner hatch and bolted it before moving to drop my gear off in room six. That's my home when I'm on shift. Room Fives door growled and rattled at me like it always does when I walk by. The door shook heavily on its hinges like something was pounding on it. Something with a lot of weight to it. 

We uh...we don't go into Room Five. 

I heard the beat of the same KATSEYE song that Sasha has been listening to on repeat since it came out, drifting from the control room. I can sing the fucking thing verbatim, that's how many times I've heard it. 

Gnarly? I think it's called. 

It's...actually not bad. 

I had my rifle, a battered M4A1 slung across my shoulder. Our gear is all military surplus, older shit. Not always the best but we're familiar with it. It's a lot of heavy duty stuff too, gear I haven't seen since my time in the Corps. Rifles, Grenades, A couple of M240B's. We even have a Carl Gustaf stashed in the armory locker that some previous crew named ""The Problem Solver"". It's written in white along the barrel. 

When I got into the control room, Sasha was sitting in one of the office chairs, swiveling aimlessly as she sipped at a mug of coffee. A Bluetooth speaker on the console in front of her was blasting music. Another cup of coffee was sitting in front of my usual station by the security cameras. 

""Youuuuuu look like shit."" She commented. ""Like worse than usual."" 

""Good to see you too."" I grumbled, flipping her off. She cackled as I sat down and logged into my station. I had access to about eight cameras fixed at access points around the Observatory. 

Stairways and ladders, Doors, the roof and the descending path into the Pit. Observatory 15 and 16 are down there apparently, closer to the mouth of the rift. 

I've never seen em. I'm glad I didn't get assigned there. This place is just the right amount of weird for me and it seems like things would probably get more fucked further down. Closer to the source of the weirdness. 

The rest of the team had begun to file in as we started to go about our day.  Miller and Delario are the other two members of the security element. Miller is a massive ex Army Ranger who turns literally everything into a football metaphor. And I do mean everything.  Delario is quieter. He was a Green Beret back when he was active duty. 

He's working on a book I think? 
Real warrior poet type shit. He's always writing in this little leather bound notebook. I guess I've got no room to talk anymore though do I? 

Anyway. 

Delario and Miller showed up and we went about our day. The research team was in one of the lab compartments below the control room doing nerd shit, with the exception of Gibson who was monitoring his own station. He's a...biologist I think? I don't know.  He doesn't talk much. 

But we were doing what we normally do, arguing about nothing and killing time. 

Delario was back in his room sleeping, he drew the short stick and was going to end up on night watch later so he was trying to grab shuteye while he could. Miller was taking a turn at the camera station while Sasha and I were debating what was really on the other side of the rift at the bottom of the Pit.  We'd been going back and forth about this for six months now. 

I'm convinced that it has to be something really fucked up, like maybe an empire that wants to invade us. Why else would they arm us like this? It's gotta be aliens or something. 

Sasha is convinced it's like a no shit portal to hell. There's money riding on whatever the answer is once we figure it out. 

""You're not even religious!"" I jabbed an accusatory finger at her. 

""I don't have to be. It makes sense.""  Sasha said smugly, swiveling in her chair. She grinned like she had maneuvered me into a corner.  ""It's science, I wouldn't expect you grunts to get it."" 

""How?"" 

""It's below us."" She said, as if that cleared everything up. 

""What?"" I asked incredulously. Even Gibson had turned around in his seat, an amused smile on his face. 


""Hell is down, Heaven is up, other dimensions are sideways. I don't make the rules Adam, decades of sci fi did."" She said in the tone of a teacher explaining something to a particularly dense student. I paused, completely dumbstruck. 

""That- you're just fucking with me aren't you?"" 

Sasha burst out laughing, doubling over in her seat. Absolute gremlin behavior. 

""Guys-"" 


""Wait so why the fuck do you think it's hell then?""

""Well-""

""BOTH OF YOU CAN IT."" Miller barked. That was his serious voice. I glanced towards him finally and saw he wasn't looking at his station. Miller's square jaw was set, the muscle there tensing and relaxing. 

He was...looking at the windows. I followed his eyeline, staring to try and make out whatever had him all twitchy. The fog was thick, drifting up in reddish clouds that made it hard to see anything. Miller stepped forward-

""There."" He said. I saw it that time. A brief glimpse of Outpost 12, across the Pit from us. Their facility was an exact mirror of ours from what I knew. Their windows faced us. 

Their dark windows. Lit up by-

""Muzzle Flashes."" I breathed. Sasha stood up, her face suddenly pale. 

""Fuck.""

I’m trying to figure out if there is any logical reason why Irish Breakfast tea wreaks absolute havoc on my system every time I drink it.

For Context:

While I’m 99% a coffee person, I did start drinking caffiene via tea at age 12 and still drink tea seasonally or with company. I grew up drinking English Breakfast and Green Tea pretty regularly, and Chai as well as I got older. By age 18 I was drinking 2-5 cups of coffee a day (I now work in the coffee business so this is still true, I also dabbled in tea product development which is how I discovered this bizzarre issue) and have never had adverse reactions to caffeine, which I want to emphasize!

I first tried Irish Breakfast Tea 6-8 years ago and later had an intensely upset stomach (nausea, the runs, fatigue) but just assumed it was something else. Tried it again the next week same thing. I’ve had it a few more times over the years and get nauseaus and sometimes genuinely pretty digestively messed up every time and I don’t understand why! 

For the record, I am mostly Irish genetically which is why this bugs me, but also I have 0 allergies that I know of other than a mild lactose intolerance (I have literally never had Irish Breakfast with Dairy!) so I just want to know if this is a mental block. For the record I am open to the possibility that I had unrelated food poisoning the first time I had it and now my body just associates that suffering with the tea??

Any help appreciated and love all of your passion <3",1,1761106360.0,tea,1,1.0,False

1ocye3u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ocye3u,Sans Rival: Its Known History from France to the Philippines,"Also known as Sansrival, Sans Rival is an all-time favorite, decadent Filipino dessert that is made of layers of dacquoise which is a crispy and baked nut meringue with a smooth, velvety and rich French buttercream called a pâte à bombe^(1). Indeed, when I first encountered it, I thought it was Filipino given its use of cashews (which originated from Brazil) and information that it is famous in the Philippines (Image 1). However, when I took classes in the language of French, I realized that sans rival are both French words. Combined, “sans rival” means “without rival” or “unrivaled”.

With that, it is unknown when sans rival was actually invented. Indeed, Doreen Fernandez notes that the earliest known cookbooks on French cuisine published in the Philippines do not mention “gateau le sans rival”^(2). However, by 1927, there was a recipe (with recipes for its components) (Images 2, a-d) for Gâteau le Sans-Rival from the cookbook La Cuisine et la Patisserie Expliquées du Cordon-Bleu by F. Barthélémy, a then-instructor at what is now the world-famous Le Cordon Bleu\^3. It was suggested to be served for dinner on September^(4) and December^(5). Interestingly, I have not yet found any other cookbook of the time with the same recipe although there are earlier editions (the earliest being from 1906^(6)) but until it can be verified that it existed there, it is best to leave the 1927 recipe as the earliest publicly known written one. Not even then-famous French chef Auguste Escoffier mentioned it so it was most likely a Le Cordon Bleu exclusive dessert. With that, anyone interested in the English translation would be happy to know that there is one from 1992 from A Culinary Life: Personal Recipe Collection by Nora Daza which she calls Le Gateau de Sans Rival (Image 3), an odd choice of name as it means Without Rival’s Cake. It seems like a good translation that gets the basics of the original French recipe. Fun Fact: She once operated a Philippine restaurant in Paris called Aux Iles Philippines where she once served the Filipino Sans Rival using almonds to create Gateau Manille^(7). Ironically, if the original sans rival were to be served in the Philippines, it would be considered an almond sans rival.

Certainly, the wealthy, affluent Filipinos went to Le Cordon Bleu around the time of La Cuisine’s 1927 edition and eventually went back to the Philippines and shared what they learned with other Filipinos. After all, French cuisine was the epitome of high class dining, a social status symbol in the Philippines. Indeed, there is a September 2, 1932 recipe for Gateau Le Sans Rival (Image 4a). It was written by Maria Paz Zamora de Mascuñana (Image 4b). Currently, it is unknown where she got her recipe from: whether from studying there, from a fellow Filipino, or from the cookbook itself. I lean towards the second option given the 1932 recipe’s shortness compared to the 1927 recipe. After all, she was able to speak French being taught by governesses and in fact also spoke Esperanto^(8). With that, it was with other recipes for teaching to her students since she wrote this recipe to be taught at the Centro Escolar University. Despite that, it still has the Sans Rival ribbon of the original recipe. 

Almost a year later, in the July 2, 1933 issue of The Sunday Tribune Magazine, there is the recipe for Sans Rival (Image 5), the first to call it the cake by its modern name, the first to use cashews termed “Casuy nut” and the first to let go of the ribbon. Oddly, it does not seem to tell you how many layers are needed and how to decorate it to layer it which implies that both are up to the baker’s taste. The photo shows them to be mini cakes (Image 5). Indeed, it would be nice if the mini cakes in the photo were decorated by Mrs. Mascuñana who also decorated cakes as shown in the April 11, 1937 issue (Image 6).

Indeed, Nora Daza notes that Sans Rival was the dessert to have in the 1960s and 1970s. With that, there have been recipes from the late 1950s which shows its increasing popularity during that time. In 1958, there was a recipe called Gateau le Sans Rival from Your Cookery Guide (Images 7, a-b) by Generosa de Leon (Image 7c). Interestingly, the recipe is an even more specific and simplified version of the 1932 recipe without the ribbon. Oddly, it tells you to write the words “Sans Rival” on the cake itself even though the photo indicates otherwise and shows that it is up to the taste of the baker. The cookbook does categorize it as a cake rather than a dessert^(9.)

With that, in the year 1959, there is a recipe for Gateau le Sans Rival from the Manila Chronicle Recipe Book Volume II (Image 8). The picture resembles how sans rival is eaten today with its layers, cream mixture and garnished nuts. It was the first time I know that it was categorized not as a cake but as a dessert despite gateau meaning cake in French as they are distinct categories in the cookbook^(10). Interestingly, it notes that the recipe is reprinted from the first volume of the Manila Chronicle Recipe Book from 1958 and would cost ₱6.13 which makes for quite an expensive dessert^(11). Then, in 1969, there is the recipe for Sans Rival on Let’s Cook With Nora by the famous Nora Daza (Image 9a). The filling has rum which makes this a dish for adults. There is a chance it is present in the original 1965 edition. I know this exact recipe (Image 9b) is present in the 1974 Galing Galing Philippine Cuisine by mother-daughter Nora Daza and Mariles Daza (Image 9c).

Then, in 1973, there is a recipe for Cake “Sans Rival” from the 19th edition of the Recipes of the Philippines (Image 10a) by Enriqueta David Perez (Image 10b). Then, in the same year, there is a recipe for Gateau Sans Rival from “what’s cooking?” (Image 11) by Inday Camara-Gumban. This recipe uses vinegar which perhaps acted as a substitute for cream of tartar. Below this recipe is one for Roca Encantada using coffee-flavored icing with decorations of fruit^(12.) Indeed, as Roca Encantada is Spanish for Enchanted Rock, the end product here does look like a rock with colorful things on top. With that, in 1974, there are 2 recipes for Sans Rival by Nalda Ramos from the Maquiling Ladies Club College (Image 12, a-b). The first recipe, Sans Rival No. 1 (not because it is better than the latter), has almond flavor perhaps for those who want to get the taste or at least essence of the original gateau le sans rival^(13) while the second recipe, Sans Rival No. 2 is your ordinary homemade sans rival. Lastly, in 1975, there is a recipe for Gâteau le sans rival from Favorite Filipino Recipes (Image 13a) by Pat Limjuco Dayrit (Image 13b). Interestingly, the recipe name used here is the one from the original 1927 edition with the â. It also gives the readers the option to use either casoy (cashew) or almonds, the order reflecting the priority. 

With that, there are recipes that come from businesses but they don’t share them publicly. The earliest known business to serve Sans Rival is Ocampo-Lansang Delicacies in San Jose, Sta. Rita, Pampanga. This business was started by Felisa Ocampo Lansang (Image 14) in the 1920s when she, along with others, were taught the recipes for sans rival and turrones de casuy by a Spanish Dominican nun in return for sewing the vestments of the priest for free^(14) in San Matias, Sta. Rita, Pampanga^(15). Interestingly, the others who were taught sold their products at different areas of Sta. Rita, Pampanga: Mrs. Miranda (Image 14) in the same location where she was taught^(15), the de Castro sisters, Antonia^(16) and Crispina (also known as Lola Pining)^(17) in Sta. Monica^(15), and Miguela Gopez de Aguilar^(16) in Dalan Betis^(15). I arranged them by order when their versions became lost recipes. Mrs. Miranda was no longer mentioned by 2005. The de Castro version seemed to have survived past 2005 and the Gopez de Aguilar version which Louis Gopez^(18) and Cherry Gopez^(19) has a sister who owned Dolly’s Sweets and Pastries located in Fairview, Quezon City which claimed to use the same recipe as Miguela Gopez de Aguilar. Unfortunately, these versions were no longer being made by the time Ocampo-Lansang Delicacies under Ramon Ocampo (who succeeded his aunt Felisa in 1997) became the face of sans rival and turrones de casuy in Sta. Rita, Pampanga. While it is certain that the turrones de casuy is from Spain, it is uncertain how the nun got the recipe for her sans rival and there ends that story for now. Interestingly, it was erroneously called San Arribal in Sta. Rita, Pampanga^(20) with a potential photo (Image 15).

Then, there is the story from My Lola Nor's Meryendahan located in Mabalacat City, Pampanga where the version from the owner’s aunt Remy comes from 1952 where it was innovated from the recipe taught by her French friend^(21). Then, there is the story from Cipriano Sans Rival where, in the 1960s, Cipriano and Dolores Alcantara, the grandparents of Cipriano’s owner Kris Alcantara-Mendoza (Image 16) found a recipe for sans rival from a magazine which they then modified until Cipriano was satisfied in which he sold it and served it to friends and family including Kris who upon his death decided to decode the recipe with her husband Pocholo Mendoza which took around 6 months and the product is what is being sold today in Ciprianos^(22). Then, there is the story from Sans Rival Cakes & Pastries where its founder Trinidad “Trining” Teves-Sagarbarria (Image 17) eventually gave in to opening this shop after being persuaded by friends and family^(23). Her recipe was based on an existing recipe which she modified into the recipe served today^(23).

With that, there are stories of their supposed invention in the Philippines. There is one (Jayashkal) that claimed that Mrs. Acosta from the Institutional Management at the Philippine Women’s University invented the cashew Sans Rival according to Aida De Leon, nee Camaniag-Hernandez^(24). Annie Abad claimed that her mother, Imelda Abad, created Sans Rival in the Philippines given that they operated Imelda’s Sans Rival from 1964 to the mid 1980s and were once televised at Cooking with Nora Daza^(25). These claims are certainly false given their invention in France but given its popularity, it is understandable why such claims were made for its invention. Interestingly, in 2009, columnist Lucy Torres-Gomez (yes that congresswoman) claimed that sans rival came from tarta imperial rusa through the use of substitutes^(26) which is certainly false given the presence of the recipes from 1927 (the original), 1932 and 1933.

Unfortunately, the original Sans Rival is no longer made and even known to be of French origin in France due to its intricate and complicated preparation^(7). There is also the Swedish Sans Rival (Image 18) which was first found in the 1934 edition of Prinsessornas kokbok^(27). There is indeed a recipe from the early 1950s which looked frequently used and passed from mother to daughter (Image 19). It turns out that, in Sweden, Sans Rival was a common name for both boats and horses to allow them to win^(27). There is also the Bolo Sans Rival (bolo meaning cake in Portuguese) from Goa, India which only few bakeries and restaurants in Goa prepare^(28). Interestingly, while Bolo Sans Rival uses cashews like the Philippine Sans Rival, Bolo Sans Rival uses almond extract in hopes of getting the taste of the original Sans Rival^(28).

Indeed, sans rival has quite a history as shown through its recipes, its claimants and its varieties whether Philippine or non-Philippine. Regardless, it is a dish worth trying at least once in a lifetime.

Received our new Linea Mini today! I’ve been so excited to get back into making coffee again - it’s been YEARS. I’ve forgotten most of what I’ve learned and we have been using a Jura for the past several years. 

I set up the machine today and have it paired with an E65W grinder. It’s definitely an over the top setup for home but I’m ready to never buy a machine or grinder again. 

I went through the initial setup and the proceeded to test some shots. Using a medium-dark roast bean, 19g in and 38mL out per the label on the bag. 

I’m also using an Acacia Lunar scale. Scale is set to 38g and paired with the machine. 

I have several questions:

1. I’ve dialed in the grind size such that 19g in is yielding about 38g out in ~25-27 seconds. Is this a good starting point? 

2. Is 38g equivalent to 38mL? For water it should be.

3. I’m very used to milk based drinks and have to remind myself what good espresso tastes like. 

4. I’m using an autocomb and then a Force Tamper. I am using the force tamper as it is an haven’t adjusted pressure. The tamp seems solid but I’m not sure how to know if further tamping is needed? 

5. I’m also using a Normcore puck screen, mainly to keep the shower head clean. 

Are there any other settings I should be aware of for getting started? What is the best way to further dial in my shot?",1,1761106070.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1ocybgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/LaMarzocco/comments/1ocybgn/getting_started_with_linea_mini_dialing_in_shots/,Getting started with Linea Mini - dialing in shots,"Received our new Linea Mini today! I’ve been so excited to get back into making coffee again - it’s been YEARS. I’ve forgotten most of what I’ve learned and we have been using a Jura for the past several years. 

I set up the machine today and have it paired with an E65W grinder. It’s definitely an over the top setup for home but I’m ready to never buy a machine or grinder again. 

I went through the initial setup and the proceeded to test some shots. Using a medium-dark roast bean, 19g in and 38mL out per the label on the bag. 

I’m also using an Acacia Lunar scale. Scale is set to 38g and paired with the machine. 

I have several questions:

1. I’ve dialed in the grind size such that 19g in is yielding about 38g out in ~25-27 seconds. Is this a good starting point? 

2. Is 38g equivalent to 38mL? For water it should be.

3. I’m very used to milk based drinks and have to remind myself what good espresso tastes like. 

4. I’m using an autocomb and then a Force Tamper. I am using the force tamper as it is an haven’t adjusted pressure. The tamp seems solid but I’m not sure how to know if further tamping is needed? 

5. I’m also using a Normcore puck screen, mainly to keep the shower head clean. 

Are there any other settings I should be aware of for getting started? What is the best way to further dial in my shot?",1,1761105889.0,LaMarzocco,1,1.0,False
1ocyben,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1ocyben/1226_good_go_bad/,[1226] Good Go Bad,"I find it interesting how quickly a sense of “overwhelmed” or “too much” or “panic” can really arrive.

It’s 9:45 PM. I’ve had something of a lazy day after returning yesterday morning from a few days in Las Vegas for When We Were Young. The night before, I had to evict our first tenant for failing to pay for over 2 weeks. Getting home, many tasks called out to me, from tending to the cats to paying an expired license plate ticket. I’ve been waiting to hear back from a job with an incredible rate per hour and the worst communication. I just discovered my old desktop computer appears to be dead-dead, meaning I have a whole rearranging of my external hard drives and USB extension project staring me down if I’m going to keep collecting, organizing, and watching my media. The mild “shock” or “annoyance” or “wtf _another thing_” sensibility is why I stopped and started writing.  
  
I have big white boards on my wall. My go-to strategy for overcoming a kind of A.D.D. paralysis is to write down everything that I could or should do that’s drawing my attention. Usually being able to cross off things like “coffee” “eat” “shower” get me up and moving through the majority of tasks and leaving the more ambitious things like “fence prep” or “weed whacker investigate” alone. Much of what I’ve needed to do over the last few weeks has been related to the sober-living home. I’m hitting something of a psychological barrier there too because I feel like at least one of my business partners is hung up on something about me she’s unwilling to share or talk about.  
  
I’ve spent a lot of time doing work that gets taken advantage of, thrown in my face, or ignored and unappreciated. What I bring to a job or entrepreneurial thing is hard to question. I raise the concerns and questions, I manage the spreadsheets and budget. I transport the client to the shelter in the middle of the night when the 3 people who live in the same city, me an hour away, can’t or won’t. We’re splitting the program fees 4 ways. 2 of the partners I don’t think have even been to the house. Not that being there means anything necessarily, but it’s becoming like a symbol of the disparity in our effort/contributions.  
  
What muddies things for me is that one of the partners I know is well connected. She’s the one that put me in contact with this new job with it’s crazy high hourly rate. I don’t lay their communication issues at her feet, and if/when I get embedded with them, it can only mean more for our overall potential and my individual paychecks. (I literally just got a text at 10:15 asking me to be at their farm at 11 AM tomorrow). Is that the cost for passive aggression? I don’t know what else she may be working on in the background or what another connection could do for the overall project, and so maybe that means I, and the actual house owner, are left to be the grunts and that’s just the nature of an imperfect and often unspoken agreement.  
  
Because I’m an actual hard-worker and chance taker, my concern is never about me or even the nature of any given problem related to what I wish to accomplish. I don’t need “faith” or “hope” that I’ll do what’s necessary to advance my aims. What has undermined my ability to grow, amass, or evolve is other people. The lack of trust, consistency, and insisted upon resentment make even mundane things cumbersome to impossible. You’ll hear me on my deathbed praising Hatsam for being there for every beat of us starting the coffee shop together. I’ll feel l owe our parents and a handful of friends indefinitely who have materially contributed to efforts over the years.  
  
I suppose I’m looking for a strategy for coping indefinitely with the attitude I know threatens the whole game. Either that, or I’m anxious and eager for a way to render it mute. I moved to my field in the middle of nowhere to render a lot of noise mute. As I cut out old nonsense, new things arrive, much like a day’s tasks independent of how many get accomplished. I know I’ve done a lot of work to return myself to the present and take things day by day, but at the same time, I think I resent how unreliable “people” or “things” are when I know how meaningful and important it is what it takes to continually rely on myself. It’s like, where do you get off expecting me to constantly put up with your bullshit? If I could shut off the part of my brain that’s intuitively responsive it’s unclear to me if that would cause more problems than fix.  
  
The person I had to evict recently was just 1 in several thousand who was a mountain of excuses instead of solutions. Life is complicated and shit happens, but literally every moment you have a choice in how to respond. You can reach out for help and communicate what’s wrong now, not 2 weeks from now. You can tell the whole story, not the version that paints you as a victim. That’s what I try to do in writing. I want to find my agency. I want to find the words that brush against the irrational or too-hot feelings so I can function in a manner I’d prefer over what’s taking me away.  
  
So much of when my stomach drops is in the anticipation of loss.&nbsp;[I know, in a deeply traumatized way, that what I care the most about can be literally torn to pieces in front of me.](https://dogg724.blogspot.com/2020/01/833-snip-it-good.html)&nbsp;I know in an embodied post-traumatic way how helpless and vulnerable I am as a stupid ape. It’s not “fair” or “right” that every whiff of threat antagonizes that stress system, but that’s what my body trained on. At some level, my built-in catastrophizing is what writing sprung forth to fix so I didn’t have to numb, punch, or clench my way through every tortured moment of “too much” thinking.  
  
I also think I remain concerned about time. I’m not always capitalizing on every moment to be “productive.” I’m not spending every spare minute learning something new or novel. And I know some of my largest projects and dreams are operating on generational timescales. That stuff feels impossible and naive when the feelings of contending with people’s day-to-day pettiness and selfishness flood in. How are we supposed to fix fascism when you can’t get your head out of your ass long enough to even vocalize the nature of &nbsp;your feelings or problem? How are we going to protect and sustain the well of creative and accountable fixes when all you can do is keep shitting in the water?  
  
All &nbsp;you can do, all I could do, is look for areas to isolate and keep betting on the next person. The process is often miserable, by default, and it’s why I’ve evolved to be the kind of person who buys band Ts that people regularly compliment and builds in shows to see every few days. I want each of my indulgences, but never as much as I want to genuinely believe in what’s compoundingly and fantastically possible. I don’t need any convincing it can all burn and explode in an unrelenting manner. I find it as hopeless and empty as I can ever feel in contemplating the disconnect between one’s ability to connect the dots of who they are and what they’re doing right now to the visceral consequences we’re all suffering. I suffer the more I give my power over to speculation. It’s not precisely making assumptions, but it is automatically responding as though I’m witnessing death, again, helpless to stop it.",1,1761105884.0,self,0,1.0,False
1ocyavo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmallBizTalk/comments/1ocyavo/what_are_5_realworld_ways_you_can_use_ai_today_to/,What Are 5 Real-World Ways You Can Use AI Today to Save Time and Boost Profit?,"AI seems to be everywhere right now. If you run a small business, you might wonder how it can actually help you. It doesn’t have to be just a buzzword. The good news is you don’t need to be a tech expert or spend a lot to use AI tools.

These tools are easy to use, affordable, and can save you time while helping your business grow. Many AI tools offer free trials or low-cost plans, making them accessible for small budgets. Let’s explore five practical ways you can harness AI today, starting with managing daily tasks and strengthening customer relationships.

**1. Streamlining Repetitive Tasks and Admin Work**

Administrative work can feel overwhelming. Emails, scheduling, and chasing payments can consume your day. AI tools can help by sorting your inbox, automating meeting bookings, and sending invoice reminders.

For example, “SaneBox” organizes emails, Clara schedules meetings, and Peter handles payment reminders so you don’t have to. Clara also began using an AI scheduler, reducing her admin time from 15 hours a week to just 5 hours. That’s 10 hours she now spends walking dogs (and getting paid) instead of juggling calendars.

When selecting an AI tool, consider your most time-consuming administrative tasks and the specific needs of your business size. Smaller businesses might benefit from versatile tools, while larger operations might require specialized solutions. With AI productivity tools, small business owners can save 20-40 hours a month on repetitive tasks.

Utilize AI to reclaim the time you previously spent on repetitive administrative tasks. With newly freed hours, you can focus on growing your business or simply take a break.

Next, let’s look at how AI can support your customer service without adding to your payroll.

**2. Smarter Customer Support Without Hiring Extra Staff**

Customers expect quick answers. Hiring a support team can be costly. AI can help with chatbots and virtual assistants. They answer questions, track orders, or handle cancellations at any time of day.

Tools like “Chatfuel” or “ManyChat” can answer common questions, such as:

“When will my order ship?” or “What are your store hours?” without requiring you to lift a finger. A local coffee roaster I know added a chatbot to their website and slashed customer inquiries by 40%.

Customers received instant replies. The owner no longer had to stay on their phone all day. This is where AI saves you money, providing 24/7 support without the need for additional staff. Today’s chatbots are so advanced that customers often struggle to distinguish them from human interactions. It’s like having a reliable employee who is always available.

**3. Content and Marketing Creation That Doesn’t Burn You Out**

Marketing is essential, but creating social posts, emails, or blog content can be time-consuming and energy-intensive. AI tools like “Writesonic” or “Canva’s” AI features can quickly suggest post ideas, email drafts, or product descriptions.

The key advantage here is that, while AI provides the initial structure and ideas, you can easily customize the content to match your brand's unique voice, addressing any concerns about sounding generic. These tools help you get started, so you don’t have to face a blank page.

One studio owner used an AI tool to generate a month’s worth of Instagram captions in under an hour. She tweaked them to sound like her, posted consistently, and saw a 25% increase in class sign-ups. Small business automation ideas like this enable you to maintain a strong marketing presence without sacrificing sleep.

You’re still in charge of the creative ideas, AI just helps with the routine work. But AI's strengths don’t end there. It can also help you make more informed decisions.

Here’s how AI can provide valuable business insights.

**4. Data Insights That Guide Better Decisions**

Data analysis can seem intimidating for small business owners. However, AI-powered analytics tools make understanding your business data simple and approachable. Tools like “Zoho Analytics” or “Etsy’s” built-in AI features help you identify which products sell the most, which advertisements are performing well, and what customer behaviors drive sales, all without requiring advanced analytics skills.

These tools automatically organize sales and marketing data into easy-to-read reports that highlight key trends and insights. For instance, a handmade jewelry seller used an AI analytics tool to spot that her earrings had peak sales during the holiday season. By shifting advertising focus to these products at the right time, she increased profits by 20% with no additional spending.

With AI, you don’t need to hire a data expert. Like a crystal ball, it helps you spend smarter on inventory, ads, or promotions, all while keeping things simple enough for a small team to manage.

AI tools are designed for non-technical users and provide step-by-step onboarding, making setup straightforward and easing any initial anxiety about getting started.

Next, see how AI can make each customer feel uniquely valued.

**5. Personalized Customer Experience That Builds Loyalty**

Personalizing your service makes customers feel valued. Doing it manually can be challenging. AI can help by sending tailored emails, product suggestions, or follow-ups based on customers' actions.

Tools like “Mailchimp’s AI” or “HubSpot” can send tailored offers or remind customers to reorder at just the right time.

I read about a pet store owner who used AI to send personalized discount codes to customers who hadn’t shopped in a while. This resulted in a 30% increase in repeat purchases. All these offers were sent automatically. With AI, you can build customer loyalty without spending hours on individual messages.

**To wrap up**, here’s how you can start reaping these AI benefits. There’s no need to overhaul your entire business at once. Instead, begin by choosing one AI tool to trial this week and see the difference it can make.

Don’t hesitate—select an AI scheduler or chatbot today and set it up this week. Experience firsthand how quickly these tools can ease your workload and enhance your bottom line.

Remember, start with a single AI tool focused on your largest time waster. Evaluate its impact this week, and then scale as you see real improvements. Take that first step—results start now.

Choose and implement one AI tool this week. Notice the difference it makes and free yourself to focus on what matters most in your business....... Start today!",1,1761105840.0,SmallBizTalk,0,1.0,False

I don’t really want to drill through the board and run the wires underneath since then it won’t sit flat on the coffee table, and they’re not really protected either. 

I’m currently thinking of hot gluing that plastic wire wrap to the side of the board, and running the wires through that, to the controller and also shortening the wires by doubling them back over themselves with zip ties or tape.

He's 17m. We've been together for almost 2 months. We've already told each other we love each other, it might be too soon but honestly I don't even care. 

I plan to go to a college a couple hours away from our town to pursue teaching. He plans to work a blue collar job in town. Hours and distances would work together against us and we'd struggle with our relationship and eventually break up. He told me this today like it's just occurred to him.

I do believe I love him, but I don't let myself hurt to much by acknowledging that we won't last through that. It's high school, it was never meant to last. 

We've talked about marriage and kids and things like that and he always sounds so enthusiastic about it happening for us, meanwhile I was shocked he even believed in us far enough out to have already gotten my Christmas present. 

The thing is, I am quite good at relationships. I want this to last, so I'll make it last, but I don't want long distance to drain me, so I won't let that happen. I think I can make this relationship last until the end of the school year, maybe even the end of summer, and then we can separate civilly and be satisfied with our time together. 

Maybe I'm very cruel for thinking like this. It would be on brand for me. I've already been clear to basically everyone, I only have three people I know will be at my wedding, and it's my parents and my best friend. I don't expect us to defy all odds and be the greatest couple of all time and last all of senior year and more. Should I pretend to? I'm not a big fan of pretending.

I don't see a reason to fault spending time with the person you love for the sake of getting attention and affection. That's all that I crave, and he offers it willingly. I doubt he'll find a better relationship immediately if we break up soon, and every other high school relationship will just blow over too anyways. It won't really waste time if we spend the next couple months of with each other instead of trying to find someone new already. 

Maybe I'm a terrible person actually. Maybe I'll just break his heart into pieces and he'll never be the same again missing his high school girlfriend. Maybe when I'm back in town we can meet for coffee or something sometimes, and catch up? I don't know, for some reason the post neutral break up stuff doesn't sound too bad.

At ALS, we encourage you to dream big.
When you join us, you’ll be part of a global team harnessing the power of scientific testing and data-driven insights to build a healthier future. 
_**About the Position**_
_**About Us:**_ We’re embarking on a multi-year journey to reimagine and re-engineer our Global Enterprise Landscape (GEL) into a modern, scalable microservices architecture — known as **GEL Evolution**. This marks the next stage in ALS’s digital journey: evolving our proven GEL Core system into a modular, future-ready platform that will serve as the foundation for ALS’s Lab of the Future vision.
With full backing from the CEO and executive leadership team, GEL Evolution is entering a major growth phase. We’re building a strengthened global delivery team — including Product Owners, Junior Business Analysts, Developers, Testers, and technical experts — to accelerate progress and deliver lasting impact.
As a Junior Business Analyst, you’ll be at the heart of this transformation. You’ll contribute to multiple GEL Microservice projects, gaining hands-on experience across domains and collaborating with cross-functional teams to help shape the future of ALS’s digital ecosystem.
This is more than just a job — it’s a launchpad. You’ll be mentored by one of our talented team members, supported as you navigate legacy systems, and empowered to explore innovative solutions. For the right candidates, this programme offers a clear path to grow into Senior BA or Product Owner roles as GEL Evolution scales globally.
_**Your Role:**_ You’ll be supported from day one by talented team members who will guide you through the essentials — from identifying where to start gathering requirements to navigating the quirks of legacy systems (some of which may feel like they belong in a museum).
You’ll begin by exploring our current ‘as-is’ state. You’ll chat with stakeholders across the business (yes, even the General Managers — who are much friendlier than their titles suggest) and uncover what’s working, what’s not, and what needs a serious upgrade.
Next, you’ll dive into research mode, hunting for smart, creative ways to modernise our systems and make them more intuitive, efficient, and dare we say, enjoyable to use.
Then comes the best part: designing the future. You’ll collaborate with our tech team to shape new solutions and document the vision that will drive ALS’s digital evolution — and yes, you’ll get to see your ideas come to life.
With your analytical mindset, we know you’ll appreciate seeing the responsibilities laid out in a more structured way — so here they are. And of course, if you have any questions or curiosities, don’t hesitate to reach out. We’re always happy to chat.
_**What You’ll Be Doing (aka Your Superpowers)**_
_**1. Understand What’s Going On (Before Changing It)**_
· Investigate the current state of our systems like a detective on a mission.
· Ask the right questions, poke around the processes, and figure out what’s working, what’s not, and what’s just plain weird.
_**2. Be a Solution Scout**_
· Research cool, innovative ideas — yes, Googling counts, but we also love creative thinking.
· Bring fresh perspectives to the table and help us avoid reinventing the wheel (unless it’s a really cool wheel).
_**3. Brainstorm Like a Pro**_
· Help organize and join brainstorming sessions — the ones with whiteboards, sticky notes, and occasionally snacks.
· If you’re feeling bold, lead a few of these sessions. We’ll cheer you on.
_**4. Turn Chaos into Clarity**_
· Take all those ideas, opinions, and “what ifs” and turn them into clear, concise user stories.
· Make sure developers, testers, and stakeholders know exactly what we’re building — and why.
_**5. Collaborate Like a Champ**_
· Work with tech teams, senior leadership, and end-user experts to co-create the future.
· Be the bridge between “business speak” and “tech speak” — we’ll give you a dictionary if needed.
_**6. Make Screens Less Confusing**_
· Partner with UX designers to make screens that don’t require a user manual or psychic powers.
· Advocate for intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that make people smile (or at least not sigh).
_**7. Help Us Move On (From Legacy Systems)**_
· Support the transition from old tech to shiny new platforms.
· Help document, plan, and smooth out the bumps in the road.
_**8. Be the Developer’s Best Friend**_
· Be available to answer questions, clarify requirements, and occasionally say “yes, that’s in scope.”
· Support testers too — they’re the unsung heroes of quality.
**_9. Time Zone Ninja_**
· Work flexible hours to sync with teams in other regions. Yes, sometimes that means early mornings or late afternoons — coffee is provided (virtually).
_**Your Profile**_
The ideal candidate is a curious, collaborative, and analytical thinker ready to dive into a career-defining transformation project.
· A naturally curious problem-solver with a sharp analytical mind and a love for turning complexity into clarity
· Strong communication skills — you can talk tech with developers and make business speak sound like plain English
· Creative thinker who’s not afraid to challenge legacy systems
· Experience in Enviro lab processes or workflows or similar environment — the more hands-on lab knowledge you bring, the better
· Comfortable working in agile teams, facilitating workshops, and translating ideas into user stories that make sense
· A collaborative mindset with the ability to bridge gaps between business, tech, and end users
· Flexibility to work across time zones — early calls, late meetings, and virtual coffee chats are all part of the adventure
**_Benefits_**
· Competitive salary.
· Opportunities for professional development and career growth.
· Flexible working hours and remote work options.
· A supportive and inclusive work environment.
· Further benefits will be defined based on specific ALS location.
_**Closing Statement**_
Applications are open until **7th November**. 
If you **applied for this role earlier in the year** and agreed to keep your application open for future opportunities, you will **automatically be considered**. If your profile matches the requirements, you will be contacted for the next stage of the process—**there’s no need to reapply**.

1ocy480,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1ocy480/1226_good_go_bad/,[1226] Good Go Bad,"I find it interesting how quickly a sense of “overwhelmed” or “too much” or “panic” can really arrive.

It’s 9:45 PM. I’ve had something of a lazy day after returning yesterday morning from a few days in Las Vegas for When We Were Young. The night before, I had to evict our first tenant for failing to pay for over 2 weeks. Getting home, many tasks called out to me, from tending to the cats to paying an expired license plate ticket. I’ve been waiting to hear back from a job with an incredible rate per hour and the worst communication. I just discovered my old desktop computer appears to be dead-dead, meaning I have a whole rearranging of my external hard drives and USB extension project staring me down if I’m going to keep collecting, organizing, and watching my media. The mild “shock” or “annoyance” or “wtf *another thing*” sensibility is why I stopped and started writing.

I have big white boards on my wall. My go-to strategy for overcoming a kind of A.D.D. paralysis is to write down everything that I could or should do that’s drawing my attention. Usually being able to cross off things like “coffee” “eat” “shower” get me up and moving through the majority of tasks and leaving the more ambitious things like “fence prep” or “weed whacker investigate” alone. Much of what I’ve needed to do over the last few weeks has been related to the sober-living home. I’m hitting something of a psychological barrier there too because I feel like at least one of my business partners is hung up on something about me she’s unwilling to share or talk about.

I’ve spent a lot of time doing work that gets taken advantage of, thrown in my face, or ignored and unappreciated. What I bring to a job or entrepreneurial thing is hard to question. I raise the concerns and questions, I manage the spreadsheets and budget. I transport the client to the shelter in the middle of the night when the 3 people who live in the same city, me an hour away, can’t or won’t. We’re splitting the program fees 4 ways. 2 of the partners I don’t think have even been to the house. Not that being there means anything necessarily, but it’s becoming like a symbol of the disparity in our effort/contributions.

What muddies things for me is that one of the partners I know is well connected. She’s the one that put me in contact with this new job with it’s crazy high hourly rate. I don’t lay their communication issues at her feet, and if/when I get embedded with them, it can only mean more for our overall potential and my individual paychecks. (I literally just got a text at 10:15 asking me to be at their farm at 11 AM tomorrow). Is that the cost for passive aggression? I don’t know what else she may be working on in the background or what another connection could do for the overall project, and so maybe that means I, and the actual house owner, are left to be the grunts and that’s just the nature of an imperfect and often unspoken agreement.

Because I’m an actual hard-worker and chance taker, my concern is never about me or even the nature of any given problem related to what I wish to accomplish. I don’t need “faith” or “hope” that I’ll do what’s necessary to advance my aims. What has undermined my ability to grow, amass, or evolve is other people. The lack of trust, consistency, and insisted upon resentment make even mundane things cumbersome to impossible. You’ll hear me on my deathbed praising Hatsam for being there for every beat of us starting the coffee shop together. I’ll feel l owe our parents and a handful of friends indefinitely who have materially contributed to efforts over the years.

I suppose I’m looking for a strategy for coping indefinitely with the attitude I know threatens the whole game. Either that, or I’m anxious and eager for a way to render it mute. I moved to my field in the middle of nowhere to render a lot of noise mute. As I cut out old nonsense, new things arrive, much like a day’s tasks independent of how many get accomplished. I know I’ve done a lot of work to return myself to the present and take things day by day, but at the same time, I think I resent how unreliable “people” or “things” are when I know how meaningful and important it is what it takes to continually rely on myself. It’s like, where do you get off expecting me to constantly put up with your bullshit? If I could shut off the part of my brain that’s intuitively responsive it’s unclear to me if that would cause more problems than fix.

The person I had to evict recently was just 1 in several thousand who was a mountain of excuses instead of solutions. Life is complicated and shit happens, but literally every moment you have a choice in how to respond. You can reach out for help and communicate what’s wrong now, not 2 weeks from now. You can tell the whole story, not the version that paints you as a victim. That’s what I try to do in writing. I want to find my agency. I want to find the words that brush against the irrational or too-hot feelings so I can function in a manner I’d prefer over what’s taking me away.

So much of when my stomach drops is in the anticipation of loss. [I know, in a deeply traumatized way, that what I care the most about can be literally torn to pieces in front of me](https://www.reddit.com/r/Banned_on_reddit/comments/1ocwtdp/833_snip_it_good/). I know in an embodied post-traumatic way how helpless and vulnerable I am as a stupid ape. It’s not “fair” or “right” that every whiff of threat antagonizes that stress system, but that’s what my body trained on. At some level, my built-in catastrophizing is what writing sprung forth to fix so I didn’t have to numb, punch, or clench my way through every tortured moment of “too much” thinking.

I also think I remain concerned about time. I’m not always capitalizing on every moment to be “productive.” I’m not spending every spare minute learning something new or novel. And I know some of my largest projects and dreams are operating on generational timescales. That stuff feels impossible and naive when the feelings of contending with people’s day-to-day pettiness and selfishness flood in. How are we supposed to fix fascism when you can’t get your head out of your ass long enough to even vocalize the nature of  your feelings or problem? How are we going to protect and sustain the well of creative and accountable fixes when all you can do is keep shitting in the water?

All  you can do, all I could do, is look for areas to isolate and keep betting on the next person. The process is often miserable, by default, and it’s why I’ve evolved to be the kind of person who buys band Ts that people regularly compliment and builds in shows to see every few days. I want each of my indulgences, but never as much as I want to genuinely believe in what’s compoundingly and fantastically possible. I don’t need any convincing it can all burn and explode in an unrelenting manner. I find it as hopeless and empty as I can ever feel in contemplating the disconnect between one’s ability to connect the dots of who they are and what they’re doing right now to the visceral consequences we’re all suffering. I suffer the more I give my power over to speculation. It’s not precisely making assumptions, but it is automatically responding as though I’m witnessing death, again, helpless to stop it.",1,1761105285.0,self,13,1.0,False

been diagnosed with PCOS since last february. my doctor told me to take althea and mypcos. i have been taking them constantly naman po pero natigil siya nitong september dahil nagkasakit ako at inoperahan. sa sobrang daming antibiotics at iba pang gamot, hindi na rin ako naka-inom ng mypcos pero constant pa rin ang althea.

dapat may check up ako ng september, pero hindi natuloy dahil nga kailangan ko mag-recover from the operation. ngayong october 18 ang re-sched ng check-up pero hindi rin ako natuloy dahil sa sobrang sakit ng puson ko dalawang araw. nagpa-re-sched ako ulit ngayong october 25.

hanggang ngayon po hindi pa rin ako nagttake ng mypcos. last kong inom ng althea ay noong october 18. hindi na rin muna ako bumili kasi naffrustrate ako, walang changes saakin. still bloated at nagccrave sa sweets. sobrang gastos din. nanghihinayang na ako sa mga gastos lalo na dahil malaki rin gastos sa operation ko. parang ayaw ko na ituloy.

minsan bumibili ako ng mypcos sa shopee, southstar drug ang shop. legit naman. pero madalas kay OB ako bumibili kasi ang bilis maubos e kaya kailangan makabili kaagad.

right now, naghahanap ako ng alternatives. still doubtful if i-continue ko ang check up at gamutan.

questions:
1. kumusta ang pure form inositol sainyo? no bad experience?
2. yung isang pack po ba gaano itinatagal sainyo?
3. should i continue taking meds and go sa f/u check-up?
4. any tips para hindi maging bloated? i drink coffee once or twice a day. i also drink cloves, rosemary, and cinnamon stick tea.

First, I would like to know if in your experience, the separation of the needles is important, I saw a video of another WDT tool which has the needles more separated. 

Then, as you can see I have what I think is a calibrated tamper. I can adjust the travel, but I am not sure if I should change it to reach something close to the one the machine includes or if should I just let it go until can't go further. 

And at last, I have two baskets, the one at the left was included with the machine, and the other one with the portafilter. I've been trying to use the one at the left, because It's a lesser dose and that way I use less coffee while I learn. I tried to adjust the grind size with the single shot basket too, but, basically I got the same results. :(

In the last year, I lost 40 pounds. I was never technically overweight, but I was right there, basically flirting with a 25 BMI. I was in a really bad headspace, convinced I had zero control over my body or my weight.

Looking back, I realize I was doing a bunch of things that made no sense, and honestly, I was just deep in denial.

Here are the craziest things I used to do:
	•	I avoided the scale completely. I didn’t want to face the number, even though it was obvious I’d gained weight.
	•	I refused to size up. I kept wearing my old Zara size small work pants, practically cutting off my circulation, and told myself they just felt tight because I wasn’t used to hard pants after COVID.
	•	I stopped feeling comfortable in my own skin. I wouldn’t even wear shorts around the house, not even with just my husband home. I brushed it off as “getting older.” I wasn’t even 30.
	•	I ate full meals while cooking: bread, cheese, wine, little bites of everything. Easily a thousand calories before dinner even started.
	•	Every Saturday, my husband and I would order two large pizzas and cheesy bread, and I’d eat six or seven slices in one sitting. Then I’d eat the leftovers for days. Basically, I was living on pizza.
	•	I had multiple lattes a day, thinking it was just coffee. It was basically milk with a splash of espresso.
	•	I snacked constantly, mostly after work, mostly out of stress.

It’s wild how normal all of that felt at the time. I truly thought I wasn’t eating a lot.

After I finally decided to face it and start tracking what I ate, everything changed. Within a couple of months, I built an insane amount of discipline. It was hard at first, but it felt like rewiring my brain. I stopped seeing food as something that controlled me. I still love eating, but it’s completely different now. I’m actually in charge.

If you’re in that space where you feel stuck or powerless, I get it. I was there too. But it really can change, and once it does, you’ll wonder why you ever settled for feeling out of control.

1ocxybz,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingHabitsBiohack/comments/1ocxybz/what_is_a_habit/,What is a habit?,"* A habit is a set of actions, pattern, done in a specific sequence.
* A habit is a recurring action. That means this set of actions happens super often—almost every day. It shows that habits are woven into our daily lives. Like washing your hands, brushing your teeth, drinking coffee in the morning, sleeping on your right side, etc..
* A habit is something you do automatically. Most of the time, it happens without conscious thought. Your hands and feet do one thing, while your mind is somewhere else. A perfect example is driving: you’re controlling the car—checking the road, pressing pedals, turning the wheel—but at the same time, you’re listening to a podcast or thinking about something totally unrelated.

But there are two other aspects of habits that modern science doesn’t really fully get yet.

**Resistance**

The first one is resistance. People usually talk about it only as a “problem” or something to fight against.

In reality, resistance is just your body—and your mind, conscious and subconscious—reacting naturally to change. People resist and feel discomfort even when the changes are actually positive.

This is what we usually call the “comfort zone,” the place we don’t want to leave.

**A fundamental feature of habits**

The second aspect is even more surprising—and truly fundamental.

Unconsciously, we tend to think of habits like this: here’s our main behavior, and then there are a few little habits. Nowadays, people even like to say “micro-habits.”

The truth is, about 90% of what we do is habits. Not just a few—there are hundreds, maybe even thousands.

Basically, all our behavior is a collection of these repeated, automated ways of acting.

Anything consciously controlled only makes up a small part of our everyday behavior.",1,1761104780.0,EatingHabitsBiohack,0,1.0,False

1ocxdcw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ocxdcw,I did personifications out of the Melbourne Trains!,"This shows how the Melbourne Trains look like as humans, or at least ""gijinkas"" which are anime characters!

And to elaborate more on the characters, this version is a little different considering **X'Trapolis 100** is *more* of a ""cool-kid"" type of character, along with a self-conscious personality where they think they're just too *beautiful* for anything. Kind of a glamorous type, they know they are a very handsome guy. Though, can exaggerate things a lil' bit whether good or bad, they can also be the barrier of drama, especially with the fellow Metro Train's. Still, they manage to stay selfless (despite being a little selfish at times, 'cause GLAMOROUS!!) and resilient anyway with the help of Comeng and co.

**HCMT** is more of a cheerful, kind, sweet and a friendly character where they are always happy to help customers, regardless of the situation. Known for their youthful personality, they *love* shopping, visiting the mall (especially Chaddy), going out for a walk, eating at restaurants, going to the movies ... or anything else you can name where they love to get up and stay active! Also the youngest of the current fleet, they love technology, and is the brains of the group. HCMT also enjoys noodles, especially ramen, Singaporean noodles, Ramyun and other Japanese, Korean and Chinese food. They are also really excited for the Metro Tunnel's opening, especially the fact that the Sunbury line will be connected *directly* to the Caulfield group. Probably one of the nicest members of the group besides Siemens.

Then here we have the lovely and the old friend **Comeng**, though a little passive aggressive as they're currently the eldest of the current fleet at Metro Trains (of course!!!). They can be a little overprotective, especially to Siemens and X'Trapolis who has known them as the ""meddling kids"" of the group. They share a big heart from history, travelling to other 'burbs, coffee (especially Dare coffee, which is basically Melbourne's equivalent to Farmers' Union in Adelaide) ~~and the fact that trams can smell a little too damp~~ and mild, cloudy days.

And now we have the good ol' **Siemens Nexas**! Personified as a youngster who loves technology not because Siemens specialises on technology, they're pretty much exposed to a lot of technology ever since, and gets along really well with Comeng (especially on the Northern Group of the Sunbury, Cragieburn and the Upfield lines). They can have a calm and a relaxed personality, but is also easy-going and friendly as well — just like the HCMT Character. Though, they may have their own challenges both as a train and as a personification, they can find it a bit challenging when they wear their own shoes (Literally! if you know what I mean by that 😉), especially down in the Sandy line. They are genuinely a warm person with a big heart of gold.

All these characters have such unique and lovable personalities which share light-hearted experience between their customers and the fellow Melbourne and the rest of Victoria's trains. While some of the trains are prone to causing a lil' bit of trouble on the network, they're still able to cope with situations, because they're still learning something new everyday. Whether it's going down the Hurstbridge line with the good ol' X'Trap, visiting Chadstone with HCMT, going to a café with Comeng or even trying out new ""science experiments"" with Siemens, there's so much to see, and so much to share with gunzels and friends.

||And *yeah*, I've seen the other post about Metro Trains Melbourne humans collection before btw. This is pretty much my *own* version though, as I've thought of these characters and their designs *way* before I saw the Metro Trains Melbourne Chans collection being publicly posted in online platforms, especially the fact that it has been published here on this *very* Subreddit back in August. I've also seen the designs a few months ago before it was posted here on Reddit, which was pretty much on a different social platform. These designs have actually been around since the start of the year (Approximately January-March, I think?)|| 

But with all the above mentioned, if you want to provide any feedback as a suggestion, or do you believe anything I've mentioned about these characters may be a little off-centre, please let me know in the comments, and I'll be far more than happy to address your feedback in no time. Thank you so much for staying connected with us, and your words really mean a lot to me in helping me with bringing the magic into my works ... and many more!",4,1761103013.0,MelbourneTrains,1,0.75,False

Last weekend, we went out for brunch, and she didn’t bring cash. The bill came, and she said, “Can you spot me? I’ll pay you after my shift.” That was five days ago. Still nothing.

I texted her about it today, and she replied, “It’s not that deep. You know I’d do the same for you.” But… she doesn’t. I feel petty for caring about money between friends, but it’s adding up and making me resentful.

1ocxa6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/NextDestination/comments/1ocxa6p/hidden_gems_and_mustdos_in_london_that_go_beyond/,Hidden gems and must-dos in London that go beyond the usual tourist spots,"I’ve spent a lot of time exploring London, both as a visitor and as someone who’s lived there for a bit, and I’ve realized that the best parts of the city often hide behind the obvious landmarks. Everyone knows **Big Ben**, **Buckingham Palace**, and the **London Eye**. But once you check those off, what’s next?

Here’s a breakdown of some less-talked-about (but genuinely great) [things to do in London](https://jotzle.com/things-to-do-in-london/) that give you a deeper feel for the city.



**1. Explore London’s Neighborhoods by Theme**

Instead of sticking to the central attractions, try exploring the city by area or vibe.

* **For history and charm:** Greenwich is worth a full day. You can stand on the Prime Meridian Line, visit the Cutty Sark, and wander through Greenwich Market for vintage finds.
* **For creativity and street life:** Shoreditch is your spot. Grab coffee at one of its quirky cafés, check out Brick Lane’s food and art markets, and hunt for street art murals.
* **For a peaceful local feel:** Hampstead feels like a village frozen in time. Walk up to Hampstead Heath for some of the best skyline views of London.



**2. Visit Museums Beyond the Big Names**

The British Museum and Tate Modern are incredible, but there are smaller ones that surprise you:

* **Sir John Soane’s Museum** in Holborn is an eccentric architect’s house packed with art, relics, and curiosities. It’s like walking through a time capsule.
* **The Museum of London Docklands** tells the city’s story from the Thames’ point of view, with fascinating exhibits about trade, slavery, and the docks’ transformation.
* **The Horniman Museum** in Forest Hill is part museum, part natural history exhibit, part aquarium. It’s also got a great hilltop view of the city.



**3. Walk (a lot)**

London rewards walkers. Skip the Tube for a few hours and you’ll discover more than you expect. Some of my favorite walking routes:

* **South Bank Walk:** Start near Westminster Bridge and follow the Thames past the London Eye, Shakespeare’s Globe, and the Tate Modern to Tower Bridge.
* **Regent’s Canal Path:** From Little Venice to Camden Market, this is a quiet, scenic route through an unexpected slice of London life.
* **The Line:** A public art walk that runs through East London, featuring outdoor sculptures and views of Canary Wharf.



**4. Eat Like a Local**

Forget chain restaurants and head for food markets and local joints.

* **Borough Market** is famous but still fantastic if you go early.
* **Maltby Street Market** (near London Bridge) is smaller and more local.
* **Flat Iron** is a great affordable steakhouse with several locations, no reservations, and free popcorn while you wait.



**5. End Your Day Somewhere Memorable**

* Watch the sunset from **Primrose Hill** or **Alexandra Palace**.
* See a smaller West End show or comedy at **Soho Theatre**.
* Or grab a pint at a riverside pub like **The Prospect of Whitby**, one of London’s oldest taverns.



**Takeaway**

London is a city that rewards curiosity. The more you wander off the main path, the more it opens up. Whether you’re into art, food, views, or just exploring on foot, there’s always something new to stumble upon.

1ocx7hn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ocx7hn/aita_for_seeing_other_people_while_raising_my/,AITA for seeing other people while raising my newborn?,"I’m not even sure how to word this without people twisting it, but I’ll try to be honest. I know people have already seen my older posts, and I’m not here to rehash everything. It’s just been a long couple of months, and I finally feel like I’m starting to breathe again.

My daughter is two months old now. Things were a mess after the birth, and I was basically on my own from the start. Her mom had complications and ended up in the hospital for weeks. I was the one taking care of the baby, doing feedings, waking up every two hours, figuring everything out from scratch. When she was finally stable enough to visit, she didn’t have a place ready for the baby. No crib, no bed, nothing safe for overnight stays. I told her that until she gets a proper setup, I don’t feel comfortable letting the baby stay there. I’m not trying to keep her away, I’m just being careful.

The DNA test came back already, and yes, she’s my daughter. I never really doubted it, but I wanted everything official so there wouldn’t be any more arguments or court issues hanging over us. Now that part’s settled.

The last couple of months have been exhausting. It’s just me and her most nights, and I’m running on maybe three hours of sleep at best. I’ve been trying to do everything right, but it’s isolating. My family helps when they can, but it’s mostly me. And honestly, I started feeling like I was fading into just a caretaker and not a person anymore.

Some friends told me to get out a little, to have a life again. So I started going on a few casual dates. Nothing serious, just lunch or coffee. I’m not introducing anyone as some “new mom” or anything like that. A couple of times, one of them came by my place for a bit, met the baby while I was feeding her, and then left. It wasn’t a big thing. It wasn’t unsafe. I wasn’t partying or bringing strangers around. I’m still being a dad first.

Of course, somehow my ex found out. Probably through mutuals or one of her cousins who keeps tabs on me.  She blew up, saying I’m disrespectful and disgusting for “bringing random women around our newborn.” Her family piled on, saying I’m setting a bad example and that it’s too soon to be seeing anyone. They act like I’m supposed to sit in silence forever out of respect for her, even though we’re not together and haven’t been for a while.

I get that people think two months sounds fast, but I’ve been living this reality day to day. When you’re up every night feeding a newborn alone, trying to keep up with work and your sanity, you start realizing how different everything feels compared to how outsiders imagine it. I’m not looking for a relationship. I just needed something normal. A conversation that wasn’t about diapers or doctors.

The baby is fine. She’s safe, happy, and healthy. I make sure of that every single day. I don’t take chances. I don’t leave her with random people. I don’t drink around her. I don’t disappear. I just happen to be talking to a few people and occasionally seeing someone for coffee.

Now my ex is saying I’m “showing off” and “trying to replace her.” She keeps saying it’s about respect, but honestly, I think it’s more about control. Because no matter what I do, it’s never right to her or her family. When I fight for my rights, I’m controlling. When I stay quiet, I’m a deadbeat. When I move forward, I’m insensitive. There’s no winning with them.

So yeah, maybe I could have waited longer, but I also know sitting around and rotting in guilt won’t make me a better dad. I’m taking care of my kid. I’m trying to build a life that’s not just chaos and anger. I don’t think that makes me a bad person.

Despite it’s name, *Nimravides* wasn’t a Nimravid (Interestingly, it did coexist with *Barbourofelis*, one of the last Nimravids), instead it was a Machairodont (A group of sabertooth predators, which include the iconic *Smilodon*), within the tribe Homotherinii. Despite similarities to *Machairodus*, to the point it was even considered another species of *Machairodus* ([Anton et al. 2013](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256400013_Machairodont_Adaptations_and_Affinities_of_the_Holarctic_Late_Miocene_Homotherin_Machairodus_Mammalia_Carnivora_Felidae_The_Case_of_Machairodus_Catocopis_Cope_1887), *Nimravides* wasn’t part of *Machairodus*-*Amphimachairodus* lineage. It first appeared in North America around 11 million years ago during the Clarendonian stage of NALMA ([Jiangzuo et al., 2022](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(22)01909-5?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589004222019095?showall=true)).

The species, *Nimravides catocopis*, was the last known species of the genus and was the largest of them all. Typically, members of the species were slightly larger than *Machairodus aphanistus*, who could’ve weighed 153 kilograms on average ([Domingo et al., 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pala.12296)). However, the subspecies known as *Nimravides catocopis lahayishupup* (Formerly known as *Machairodus lahayishupup*), grew to even larger sizes. On average, the species could’ve weighed 272 kilograms, with the largest males weighing 427 kilograms, this makes it a contender for one of the largest Felids on the planet. A 2021 paper estimated that *N. c. lahayishupup* could’ve hunted prey between 413 to 1,386 kilograms, with the largest possible prey weighing 1,600 kilograms, suggesting it could’ve hunted animals as large as *Teleoceras*. But they do admit that it may not have been a large prey specialist due to the robust humeri of sabertooths being more suited for subduing prey rather than hunting large species ([Orcutt and Calede, 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10914-021-09540-1)).

This is further supported by jaw biomechanics which found that sabertooth adaptations were far more ideal to kill more normal sized herbivores instead of megaherbivores as commonly argued ([Andersson et al., 2011](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024971)). Additionally jaw gape analysis found that *N. catocopis* had a jaw gape of roughly 68° ([Lautenschlager et al., 2020](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.1818)). This is slightly lower than its contemporary rival, *Barbourofelis fricki*, who had a jaw gape maximum of 73° ([Figueirido et al., 2024](https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ar.25451)). So it’s  unlikely *Nimravides* hunted megaherbivores often, and if it did, juveniles would’ve been the preferred prey choice over adults. Unlike its distant relative *Homotherium*, *Nimravides* has a narrower forehead compared to its rostrum, which suggests it may have been more adapted for forested environments ([Jiangzuo et al., 2023](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2023.0019)).

*Amphimachairodus coloradensis* (Depicted in the background) was the oldest officially named North American species. Another unknown species of Amphimachairodus, although dubbed Amphimachairodus cf. horribilis, entered North America at Hh2 ([Jiangzuo and Hulbert, 2021](https://www.academia.edu/49048783/Coexistence_of_Indarctos_and_Amphimachairodus_Carnivora_in_the_Late_Early_Hemphillian_of_Florida_North_America)). While its possible ancestor, *Amphimachairodus horribilis*, was larger than modern day Lions and Tigers, *Amphimachairodus coloradensis* was about the size of modern Lionesses to the lower end of average male Lions, having an average mass of 144 kilograms ([Orcutt and Calede, 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10914-021-09540-1)). 

However, what it may have made up for its smaller size was an adaptation for more open environments which helped it avoid competition with *Nimravides* ([Jiangzuo et al., 2022](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(22)01909-5?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589004222019095?showall=true) and [Jiangzuo et al., 2023](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2023.0019)) In addition, there may have been a possibility that *Amphimachairodus coloradensis* was a gregarious predator (As depicted in this artwork). For one, the adaptations of living in open environments, something commonly seen in the genus. Two, its ancestors, *Amphimachairodus hezhengensis* and the more distant *Machairodus aphanistus*, have been found to be gregarious predators ([Jiangzuo et al., 2023](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2023.0019) and [Salesa et al., 2024](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10914-024-09721-8). *Machairodus*’ case shows that within this lineage, woodland environments didn’t stop the development of gregariousness for the lineage and it was adopted prior to adaptations towards grasslands. 

As mentioned before, both cats would’ve preferred different habitats. But this didn’t stop them from being found in the same locality, Coffee Ranch, Texas. So within Coffee Ranch, competition between the two Homotheres likely happened, but it was likely minimal overall as they aren’t often found in the same areas. Additionally, *Amphimachairodus* was relatively rare, which furthermore diminished competition between the two predators. Because of that, it was likely that *Amphimachairodus* passively replaced *Nimravides*, as the latter couldn’t cope with expansion of grasslands ([Jiangzuo et al., 2022](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(22)01909-5?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589004222019095?showall=true)).

Interestingly, one group of competitors seemed to have coexisted with these Homotheres seemingly everywhere during, it wasn’t macropredatory Canids, nor a macropredatory Hyenas, heck not even Nimravids (Although they did coexist with each other across Eurasia), but instead it was the Agriotherines, a tribe of Ursids. Despite their appearance, their closest living relatives was the herbivorous Giant Panda ([Jiangzou et al., 2023](https://bioone.org/journals/american-museum-novitates/volume-2023/issue-3996/3996.1/New-Fossil-Giant-Panda-Relatives-Ailuropodinae-Ursidae--A-Basal/10.1206/3996.1.full)). They’ve been found in Eurasia and North America, and even Africa itself! 

The species depicted in this artwork was *Indarctos oregonensis*, perhaps one of the largest species within the genus. [According to Blaze’s reconstruction, the animal suggests it would’ve stood around 123 cm at the shoulders and likely weighed well over 279 kilograms, as it was larger than Indarctos atticus, who weighed around that much](https://blazze92.deviantart.com/journal/The-largest-known-bear-Part-1-440241554). Unlike modern Ursids, *Indarctos* was presumably a cursorial predator, although not to the level of *Agriotherium* and *Huracan*. It was also possible that *Indarctos oregonensis* was largely carnivorous as well ([Jiangzou et al., 2023](https://bioone.org/journals/american-museum-novitates/volume-2023/issue-3996/3996.1/New-Fossil-Giant-Panda-Relatives-Ailuropodinae-Ursidae--A-Basal/10.1206/3996.1.full)). 

However, another threat to *Amphimachairodus* would’ve been *Huracan schnederi*, as they were more adaptive towards open environments than *Indarctos* and more carnivorous ([Jiangzou et al., 2023](https://bioone.org/journals/american-museum-novitates/volume-2023/issue-3996/3996.1/New-Fossil-Giant-Panda-Relatives-Ailuropodinae-Ursidae--A-Basal/10.1206/3996.1.full)). *Huracan schnederi* was also very large, with one study estimates based on m1 regressions that it weighed 378 kilograms ([Juhn et al., 2024](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/paleobiology/article/cenozoic-climate-change-and-the-evolution-of-north-american-mammalian-predator-ecomorphology/CDF3786B3FA8A1DB57FF6CED340F33F3)),
although another study got an even higher body mass through unknown methods, estimating the Ursid to weigh 510 kilograms ([Hannold, 2019](https://repository.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:760034)).

Isotopic analysis from Optima Fossil Site, Oklahoma, where both predators coexisted with one another, found that they had the largest niche partitioning of any large Carnivora present. *Huracan* was found to be omnivorous as isotopic analysis matched that of the Cave Bear (Which was herbivorous or omnivorous and likely scavenged from other herbivores. The herbivores it consumed were Horses and C3-consuming herbivores, although there is a possibility the isotopic values could mean preference for scavenging larger animals, increased consumption of bone, scavenging/hunting in closed environments, or being less hypercarnivorous than expected. What is likely is probably the combination of the four. *Amphimachairodus coloradensis*, on the other hand, was hunting C3-consuming herbivores and C4-consuming Horses. So while *Huracan* may have lived in more forested environments, *Amphimachairodus* lived in more open environments. Although they both did hunt C3 herbivores, it is very likely they weren’t hunting the same species that often as they still had evidence of a very large niche partitioning ([Fredickerson et al. 2021](https://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app67/app009412021.pdf)).

Interestingly in Yepómera, Mexico, *Huracan* was more carnivorous, hunting Horses that dwell in the grasslands ([Hannold, 2019](https://repository.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:760034)). This does bring up an interesting question, could the presence of large, possibly gregarious Carnivorans play a role in *Huracan* being more omnivorous? 

This was documented in *Arctodus simus*, the largest known bear to roam North America, where RLB specimens tend to be more omnivorous than Beringian specimens ([Figueirido et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18116-0)). Within RLB, *Arctodus* simus coexisted with American Lions and *Smilodon fatalis*, both were the largest hypercarnivores on the continent and both have evidence of gregariousness ([Balisi et al., 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.07.897348v2.full), [Carbon et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2008.0526), [DeSantis and Shaw, 2018](https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2018AM/webprogram/Paper322567.html), and [Wheeler and Jefferson, 2009](https://www.academia.edu/1231394/PANTHERA_ATROX_BODY_PROPORTIONS_SIZE_SEXUAL_DIMORPHISM_AND_BEHAVIOR_OF_THE_CURSORIAL_LION_OF_THE_NORTH_AMERICAN_PLAINS)). Neither American Lions or Smilodon were found in Beringia, this likely reduced competition if hunting/scavenging large herbivores.

A example (Although more extreme) was *Arctotherium*, which saw a trend towards omnivory because of the increasing diversity of large hypercarnivorous Carnivorans ([Soibelzon and Schubert, 2011](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259887580_The_Largest_Known_Bear_Arctotherium_angustidens_from_the_Early_Pleistocene_Pampean_Region_of_Argentina_With_a_Discussion_of_Size_and_Diet_Trends_in_Bears)). However, *Arctotherium angustidens* was contemporary with *Smilodon populator*, and isotopic analysis found it to have a major consumption of flesh ([Soibelzon et al., 2015](https://www.academia.edu/128203825/South_American_giant_short_faced_bear_Arctotherium_angustidens_diet_evidence_from_pathology_morphology_stable_isotopes_and_biomechanics)). And interestingly enough, *Smilodon populator* was found within the same site with the individuals sampled ([Soibelzon et al., 2008](https://www.academia.edu/1487956/Faunistic_analisys_of_vertebrates_from_las_toscas_del_R%C3%ADo_de_La_Plata_Buenos_Aires_Argentina_a_palaeontological_site_in_disappearance), but ofc more data is needed for this.

This doesn’t mean *Huracan* wasn’t going to be a threat to *Amphimachairodus*, far from it, a Ursid that weighed well over 300 kilograms and maybe pushed 500 kilograms is going to be a threat to *Amphimachairodus*, on occasion. Even if they have a large niche partitioning, conflicts over carcasses are inevitable and a possibility both could’ve predated on each other cubs.

Funny enough, *Amphimachairodus*’ history with Agriotherines goes back even further, extending to the oldest species of the genus, the aforementioned *Amphimachairodus hezhengensis*, where it coexisted with two unnamed  Agriotherine bears the size of *Indarctos atticus*, with these bears and the abundant *Dinocrocuta*, probably triggered more adaptations towards gregariousness, other than open environments, ([Jiangzuo et al., 2023](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2023.0019)). 

Before we go to our last notable rivalry, we have *Adeliosmilus kabir* and *Agriotherium africanium*. Both predators were found in Langebaanweg, South Africa ([Jiangzuo et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2023.107212) and [Valenciano et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9221)). 

Now let’s talk about *Machairodus aphanistus* and *Indarctos arctoides*, arguably the start of it all. The latter was larger than, with average boars (males) weighing 265 kilograms. However, sows (females) would’ve been slightly smaller than an average *Machairodus*, with average sows weighing 137 kilograms ([Abella et al., 2013](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073711)). The overall average of  the Ursid would be almost 50 kilograms (Around 201 kg) larger than *Machairodus*. Isotopic analysis found a diet of omnivory that leaned towards carnivory, this is interesting despite living with a relatively gregarious Lion-sized Felid ([Domingo et al. 2016](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301687485_Feeding_ecology_and_habitat_preferences_of_top_predators_from_two_Miocene_carnivore-rich_assemblages). On top of that, BAT-3 *Machairodus*’populations showed a slightly more advanced morphotype closer to that of *Amphimachairodus*, which may have coincided with the appearance of Indarctos arctoides, which were found BAT-3 sites and weren’t found in BAT-1 or BAT-2 sites. ([Jiangzuo et al., 2022](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(22)01909-5?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589004222019095?showall=true))

Of course, this coexistence came to an end, both *Huracan* and *Agriotherium* would go extinct by the Early Pleistocene and would later be replaced by Ursines ([Jiangzou et al., 2023](https://bioone.org/journals/american-museum-novitates/volume-2023/issue-3996/3996.1/New-Fossil-Giant-Panda-Relatives-Ailuropodinae-Ursidae--A-Basal/10.1206/3996.1.full)). Homotheres would continue to persist into the Late Pleistocene via the lineage Homotherium. Much like Honotherium’s ancestors, they would also have to worry about large Ursids stealing their kills, but these Ursines reached even larger sizes. As mentioned before *Arctodus simus* was the largest bear to ever roam North America and to a lesser extent Brown Bears.

Nevertheless, Homotheres and Agriotherines was the perhaps the longest cat-bear rivalry, lasting well over 5 million years, consisting of multiple taxas. In my opinion, it’s perhaps one of the most interesting stories of the Cenozoic.

so
i recently started working at a new work place after relocating so i have no close friends around me

the city, ppl around me, my routine, everything’s new
prob im feeling a bit lonelier than last year

there’s this one guy who has been scheduled in same shifts multiple times as i did and i found him REALLY cute
his smile, his hair, his beard, him talking, i just want to know more about him
he is such a hard working person from what i saw already

i was able to talk to him for quite long 1-2 hrs during break
i mostly asked about him not too personal questions but just his interests and some tips about the job ive got as first i wanted to be sociable

then when he was talking to another colleague the other day 
i found him cute cute

he was being nice and considerate not to leave me alone awkward by explaining things to me as i asked
he also was explaining about his music playlist after i asked him what kind of coffee he usually gets
mannn

i usually didnt get flattered by these kindness but this time i have been flattered multiple times by him
i think he’s younger than me
he’s so cute

next it was after the busy shift he was checking on me nicely and complimented how i did really well at work offering high fives 
here i got so shy for such small things
he is very gentle when talking to me 
its different to how he talks with other coworkers as i am the only international there

the previous male coworkers i had i regularly hugged them whenever i showed up to work and high fived them raged screamed at them but i didn’t get flattered by them yall 😭

im in my mid-end twenties im not in early twenties
honestly i had boys who were flirting with me or intimately interacting with me before
this happens rarely like 1 out of 20 in the room

unfortunately i ended up having 0 romantic interests on them but only fully friends mode that was all 
i thought/knew they are also just having fun and not being serious at all

i wasn’t romantically/sexually attracted to most of the boys since i haven’t really met boys who made me curious who i want to know more about them

ive been thinking this is bcs of me being bisexual and i only confirmed this just a couple of years ago after moving abroad learning more about diversity
so i thought i basically have different standards towards boys than straight girls 

ive lived in different countries and worked in various environments so this is definitely not my first time being in a such unfamiliar environment to just got stuck in thinking about a guy at work constantly if you understand

whenever i was hearing my psychiatrist telling me to find a guy to date with
i was snorting who tf will i be interested in and in what chance ill find someone im interested in that would actually be interested in me as much as i am at the same time!!!!

im good alone for now i cannot even take good care of myself 😭 im chronically uninterested and unbothered rn based on constant deteriorating & recovering mental health conditions that which everyone also is experiencing in this society 

now im remembering my older senior colleagues always telling me that i should have a boyfriend bcs they think im sweet pretty cute
which i dont agree im insecure from ptsd

i cannot rant this out to my close friends in same age group we all are not that young now and other close friends i met are way younger than i am i feel embarrassed to share that i cannot stop thinking about this guy at work who i only met for a couple of weeks💀

anyways so i don’t deny the fact that i find him attractive from the beginning 
i was looking forward to see him at work all weekend and i showed up smiling wide at him ofc i did my job done clocked in

i think i was smiling too obviously he was actually slightly laughing a bit when i smiled at him passing by
he came to me to chat and joke shortly while being quite close to me too quite often
im honestly not hiding it im intentionally showinf it

i should know whether he has a partner or not 🥸 not 100 sure as he talked about a topic related to his (ex- or current i don’t rmb well) gf who found a job somewhere ish

i will stop looking at him as soon as i know whether he has a partner

but do u think he at least isn’t bothered by me right?

my delusional dreams are already showing me different scenarios please help my brain to brain up

the real fockery is that i was wheezing when my intelligent female friends were turning into one brain cell and crashing out on boys
i think i am doing the same thing now

well even if he’s not interested in me now i know who i can look for either girls or boys right?

1ocwyuw,https://i.redd.it/5qf9bwzaukwf1.png,I'm at a loss for what to do with my living room,"Hi all,

I have an open concept main room and I'm at a loss as to how to lay it out.  I redid the floor, which formerly was split into laminate on the kitchen/entry side, and carpet on the living room side, with a tacky metal transition strip down the middle and I hated how it divided the space and limited my layouts.  But now I feel like I have too many options!

Also, I put shelving on the only solid wall, so no matter what my TV is floating in space or blocking a window.  And maybe I have too much furniture?  

Negotiable: The chaise lounge, one or both armchairs, the library chair, the table between the armchairs

Must-keeps: The couch, round side table, TV stand, coffee table, cat trees

The kitchen had a peninsula from out of the left wall that I ripped out and would like to add an island in, maybe; that's a whole other can of worms.  As it is right now, I'm a single person living alone who doesn't host or entertain often, and I have no need for a formal dining space.",2,1761101823.0,DesignMyRoom,1,1.0,False
1ocwyhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayrelationships/comments/1ocwyhn/not_sure_if_my_friend_is_gay_or_not/,Not sure if my friend is gay or not,"This is a long one so I appreciate those who take the time to read this. I (22M) have been friends with this guy (27M) for almost a year now. We met off of bumble because I had my gender switched to female instead of male (yes I know awful of me). We started talking and he asked if I ever had a guy yet and I said no and he said hot and I responded with are you going to be my first and he said yes. I didn’t know what to expect from it but we hung out twice in December with the first hangout telling me he was straight and wasn’t looking for anything with a guy. We barely talked over winter break but when we came back to school in January, he messaged me asking if I wanted to get food and I said sure. 

When we got food, we just talked and he had complimented me on how I looked cute in my coat. He had asked if I wanted to go out with him to the bars the upcoming weekend and at first I hesitated because I didn’t want to see him approaching any women. We continued to hangout throughout the upcoming months and continuously got food and coffee and we had our own tv show that we would watch. I ended up falling hard for him and wrote a letter being honest about my feelings for him in March. 

I gave him the letter and he said that it was one of the sincerest gifts he had ever received. I noticed that after I gave him that letter, he was definitely more warm towards me and changed his demeanor. We did the same thing of hanging out and going out to the bars/clubs consistently but I began to question our relationship. I knew he was straight but I fell hard for him so we had an honest discussion about what we were doing and he said that for the past 4 months, we have been in a relationship. I told him no because no romance has been involved once but to him we had been dating these past 4 months. There were dynamics within the friendship that made me question this like one of them insisting we pay separately when it came to getting food and at first it was like that but then it became a thing where he paid for food and I did and so on and so forth. I didn’t mind it but to him he insisted he was an adult and could pay for his own things and insisted on going back to this dynamic but we never fully did. 

He would also say very sexual jokes. I know he meant it in a joking way but the way I would joke with my other heterosexual friends  was way different with him. On top of that, he was too knowledgeable on gay lingo such as knowing what cum dumps and bears and otters and other things for him being the straight man he is. 

I graduated from college and moved back home. We kept in touch and met in the middle of the state to see each other again in June. We saw each other in July but this was due to him having his flight diverted to the state capitol and he called me to ask what I was doing. I said I was visiting my father and he told me to come for the night to come spend time with him and hangout. I did and so I drove 3 hours to see him and we hung out. I asked him out of all his friends, why did he call me. He said that he knew I wasn’t the busiest but also how he was also wanting to see me because he missed me. 

We saw each other again in August and again now recently in Miami. All my friends and even strangers I’ve talked to about this situation say he’s gay or bicurious at least. My friend even told me that he’s willingly paying for part of a trip and spending alone time with you and he’s still straight???? I’m just curious of what y’all’s opinion is if he is really gay/bisexual or straight or if I need to include more specific details. Again thank you. ",2,1761101791.0,gayrelationships,1,1.0,False

The last few days have been brutal. I barely eat, nights are the worst because I can't sleep. I've tried following some sort of routine, but my routine revolved around my sweet girl Amy. Yesterday and today I went to the local dog park that we've been going to together for almost 15 years, where I proceeded to break down multiple times in uncontrollable sobs and had complete strangers hugging me. I searched endlessly for tennis balls in the fields even though she was always better at finding them than I was. When I did find one, I threw it as far as I could just for her and imagined I could see her running to get it. 

I broke down in the bookstore that we used to go to together. I broke down watching the fountains she used to enjoy playing in so much. I broke down wasting time at the coffee shop she and I used to go into while playing cards at the table and imagining her on the floor next to me. I've been carrying around the last tennis ball I bought her and found myself squeezing it multiple times throughout the day.

I have my first therapy appointment scheduled for a couple of days, but I don't know how to survive this heartbreak. I've been temporarily staying with family and spending a couple of hours here and there at my place, but I can't get used to the silence. I find myself burrowing myself in the blankets that still smell like her and staring into a void that I can't escape.

I haven't smiled since the day Amy left, and I hate that I can't guide her and keep her safe on her next adventure. I hate the possibility that I'll never see her smiling face again. I want father time to take the knife that he stabbed my heart with to free these thorns from my soul.

Hello r/WallStreetBets and robotics enthusiasts! 

Richtech Robotics (RR) has been quietly perfecting its flagship robot, ADAM, for years, and now they’re ready to unveil a new, full-body humanoid at NVIDIA GTC (Oct 27-29, 2025, D.C.) that could surpass Tesla’s Optimus. 

This isn’t ADAM 3.0—it’s a distinct humanoid leveraging Richtech’s proven tech. Hold your RR shares; this could be big.

ADAM has been operational in real-world settings, serving over 16,000 drinks at venues like Kennedy Space Center and Toyota Arena. Its hardware was ahead of its time:

	•	Robust arms: Designed for precise tasks like mixing cocktails, brewing coffee, and handling high-volume service at events, including for the U.S. Space Force.

	•	Expressive display: A face-like screen for engaging customer interactions.

	•	Advanced vision and voice: Cameras for navigating busy environments and voice AI for natural communication.

Before the AI revolution, ADAM was limited—a powerful body executing pre-programmed tasks like bartending or serving. It lacked the intelligence for complex decision-making. 

The AI boom, powered by NVIDIA’s edge computing (ADAM notably served NVIDIA’s CEO at a prior GTC), transformed it. ADAM 3.0 now adapts in real-time, adjusts coffee brewing based on conditions, and anticipates customer needs using enhanced vision-AI. Richtech simply integrated AI into ADAM’s existing frame, instantly upgrading its capabilities without a hardware overhaul.

The new humanoid builds on this. ADAM provides the perfect upper body, while Richtech’s other robots, like the Matradee Plus (a food delivery bot navigating restaurants flawlessly), supply proven mobility tech. By combining these, Richtech is creating a complete humanoid—likely bipedal or wheeled-hybrid—faster than competitors. 

Tesla’s Optimus is still in development, but Richtech’s robots are already generating revenue in hospitality, giving them a head start in deploying practical humanoids for real jobs like bartending or hotel service.

At GTC, expect a reveal of this NVIDIA-powered humanoid, ready to work smarter and faster. With years of groundwork, Richtech is positioned to lead.

1ocwohi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1ocwohi/i_am_a_paranormal_research_agent_this_is_my_story/,"I am a Paranormal Research Agent, this is my story. Case #001 ""The bus to Nowhere""","My name is Elijah Wiltburrow. I've been advised that I'll need to redact certain things from this statement, not that many of you would believe a lot of this. I don't mean to insult you all, but most people don't seem to take anything paranormal with more than a grain of salt, maybe at most something to believe in for the thrill of believing that something is out there. Well, there is.

At the time of this story, I had been newly hired by an organisation that specialises in the study of the paranormal. I can't say the name of the organisation for obvious reasons, but I was drawn to it for two very important reasons.

The first reason is that I have always been drawn to the paranormal. Growing up, I was fascinated with ghost stories and read all I could on the subject. This later blossomed into me studying parapsychology, which leads me to my second reason for joining this organisation. It is very difficult to get a job when you're primarily a scholar of a defunct field of study. ""Debunked"" isn't technically the word I'd use.

It's real. I knew it at the time, and I sure as hell know it now, but that's not the point of this statement.

My friend and fellow field research operative, Lily Heinz, had accompanied me on my first job assignment. Now, Lily Heinz is a psychic. I think this is important to clarify now before we continue.

She had an episode a few months prior to this case and was “scouted” by the organisation. I use those quotation marks because it was really an ultimatum: work for them or… well, I think you can fill in the rest.

She hadn't been a particularly powerful psychic in the time I had known her, but she was aware enough to sense when some paranormal energy was around. A helpful tool in our line of work.

Now this was my first case of my career, and I didn't really know what to expect. I mean, when you are told that there is a likely paranormal bus picking people up in the middle of the night, well, it kind of kicks any expectations out of your head.

We sat inside of Lily's car; the cold night air was thick, and a fitting, almost comical fog had swept in a few hours previously. Her car's heater had died a few weeks previously, so we both sat in an awkward silence wearing our heavy puffer jackets, struggling to stay awake.

We were parked on the side of one of the few roads entering the small mining town of \[REDACTED\], the street itself wasn't anything special, just a gravel road and high trees.

A few hundred feet down from us was a single street lamp with a bus sign hanging off it; the lamp was off. We both watched the street lamp with unwavering concentration; the dossier I was given for this case had explained that from the hours of 11 pm to 4:35 am a mystery bus would come and pick up hitchhikers.

And so here we are, waiting at 1 am for a bus or something to show up. I remember feeling a certain excitement from all of this; I'm pretty sure it's the only thing that kept me awake. Lily was less enthused. This was our second night surveying the site, and last night we hadn't gotten anything. She was quick to say that this was likely just another local legend that we could log as a ""myth"" in the paperwork, but the rules are the rules, we have to survey a site for at least two weeks if the paranormal entity or object doesn't abide by time regulations.

""Looks like we have someone,"" she said. Her words broke my concentration on the street lamp, and I raised the camera I had with me and zoomed in on the figure. It was a woman wearing a heavy jumper and what looked like a backpack. A runaway, maybe?

As she got closer to the street lamp, I looked at lily, she winced her eyes and looked at me.

""There is definitely something here, Elijah,"" she said with tension.

""How can you tell?"" I asked, but as I said this, the street lamp suddenly lit alight, the bus sign illuminated, and a small bench that I hadn't seen in the dark sat underneath it.

""Shit,"" I blurted out before I grabbed the door handle, but she grabbed my shoulder and held me back.

""We have to watch, this is our job, rookie,"" Lily said to me sternly.

The woman cautiously walked up to the bench and took a seat. She sat there for a few minutes, and we watched, took photos and notes, all protocol. After at most five minutes, I heard an engine coming from behind us. I looked in the rear-view mirror and saw two bright lights approaching from the distance.

An old transit bus pulled up, and the women and the sign were obscured from view. I took some photos, and Lily looked like she was concentrating on something; she had her eyes closed and hand slightly outstretched towards the bus. After a minute, the bus's engines came back to life and drove away, and the street lamp turned off. Lily pressed her foot down, and the car began to wheel out off the side of the road and follow the bus, but after five or so minutes, the bus was gone. It didn't vanish like a ghost or melt away; it just simply disappeared.

She got out of the car and grabbed something out of the trunk, then she walked towards the side of the road and stabbed something into the dirt; it was a GPS pin. a portable tracker that, when turned off, left a pin on your GPS, helpful for when you're tracking things in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night.





We drove back to \[REDACTED\] and stayed in an old motel. It was just before 2 in the morning when I dropped like a tonne of bricks onto the bed. I drifted to bed immediately and awoke to the sound of knocking on the motel room door. I shot up and walked over to the window, looking out onto the walkway outside the door, and saw Lily standing there in a pair of jeans, a black button-up and her red hair tied back into a ponytail.

I looked at the alarm clock next to my bed, and it read 10.

""Shit!"" I remember saying before I opened the door. Lily looked at me and smiled.

""The best thing about working cases at night is that you can sleep like hell through the day. Enjoy it; soon you won't be able to sleep much at all,"" she said before placing a cup of coffee in my hand. I didn't even realise she was holding one. I took a sip and let the warm, beautiful sensation of coffee flood my empty stomach.

""You smoke?"" she asked while holding a box of cigarettes in her offhand.

""Ehh, no,"" I said awkwardly, and she shrugged before lighting one up.

She looked at me inquisitively. She leaned back on the table that sat opposite the end of my bed, and I sat on the bed, coffee in one hand and my head in the other.

""So what did we see last night?"" she asked.

I looked at her confused.

""The… bus?"" I said, genuinely confused, which made her sigh.

""Yes, the bus. What do you think it was?"" she said. I got the impression that she wasn't asking and that this was a test, and so I focused on what I had learnt leading up to this. Even before I was hired by the organisation, I had studied stuff like this for years.

""Well, the bus itself is clearly odd, it doesn't show up on any transport schedule or follow any routine, and yet it knew when that woman was there. It must be parked nearby or—"" My concentration broke. ""Shit, that woman. Has there been any news of her?"" I asked.

""Yes and no. Betty James was reported missing a few hours ago, and from what it looks like, she was running away from home, just like the others,"" she said before taking another swig of her smoke.

""Plus, the rate of people running away is significantly higher here than anywhere else in the surrounding areas, probably related, but I'm not sure how,"" she continued.

""And are we sure this thing is paranormal? Maybe it's just a coincidence."" I felt stupid for asking.

""Rookie, trust me, this is definitely paranormal. I got a feeling."" That feeling she got was what I'd later learn was her own paranormal awareness.

""Ok, so what's our next move? We can't keep watching, we know next to nothing about this thing,"" I said.

""I agree, we need eyes on this thing,"" she said with a malicious grin. The air in the shitty motel room suddenly grew thick as I realised what she was asking.

""You must be joking; I can't go on that thing. We don't even know where it goes.""

""You're right, we don't know dick besides where it disappears and what times it appears. Don't worry, I'm not sending you alone, I'll be coming with,"" she said and threw the smoke bud into the drain of the sink in the small kitchen.

""Till then, write down your notes and statement on last night's events, and try to rest up for tonight,"" she said whilst walking out of the room. She gave me a mischievous look when I realised that she gave me coffee when I definitely don't need the caffeine. Say what you will about Lily and her ""arrangement"" with the organisation, but she definitely knew how to make a joke in any situation.





After a day of tossing and turning, trying and failing to fall asleep, I eventually had to get up and get ready for work. It was 8 pm, and the night air was crisp. Lily drove us out to a diner on the edge of town, and I immediately ordered myself a black coffee.

""Didn't sleep well?"" Lily asked with a smile that said she was genuine but with a look that said she knew the answer.

""Surely I can report you for this,"" I said jokingly, although a part of me was genuinely interested in following this up. She laughed, and after a moment my coffee arrived. I took a sip, and Lily lifted a small backpack off the ground and onto the table.

I can't go into the specifics, of course, but imagine a ghost-hunting survival kit. The closest thing I can compare it to is shark hunting with a spear. Sure, you can harm the shark, but the chances of it harming you are still far too high once you're in its waters, and tonight we were diving right in.

A few hours later we pulled up to the side of the road across from the bus stop, the same spot as last night. We both got out, photographed the bus stop and walked over. The light for some reason didn't turn on when we approached, but we both had torches and a small wind-up lamp that had some power to it.

We waited for what felt like hours as we sat at the bus stop, and eventually, to what felt like our luck, the light lit up.

""Something is definitely here,"" Lily said, and as I looked at her, she held two fingers against her left eyebrow, as if there was tension there.

""Ehh, hello?"" A voice said from the left of us. I look over, and a young man, maybe 19, was standing there with a large bag and a puffer jacket. Shit, it wasn't waiting for anyone; it was waiting for people running away.

""Hey bud, how are you?"" I said in the friendliest tone I could, which I now realise would've been extremely unnerving considering the circumstances. I was only a few years older than this guy, and I tried to seem as natural as possible.

""I'm… good,"" the runaway said whilst still standing a few metres away.

""Elijah, heads up,"" Lily said silently after she placed a hand on my shoulder. I looked up at her, and she nodded her head towards the distance where two headlights shone towards us.

""So what brings you out of town? Going on a trip?"" I said as naturally as I could. Lily later told me that I weirded even her out.

""N-no… I just need to get out of this town, y'know,"" he said after a long moment.

The bus passed me and Lily and stopped directly in front of the runaway. This thing really had a target, but we both jogged over to the runaway and lined up behind him. The runaway was the first to enter, and after he stepped on, the door tried to shut but stopped midway through before slowly opening again, almost like it was reluctant to let us on.

We stepped up the steep metallic steps, and I tried to get a look at the bus driver, but from all I could see in the very dark bus was that he wore a typical bus driver uniform and sunglasses. He made no moves to greet or even acknowledge us. Lily was behind me, and after walking slowly down the aisle, I sat on the middle left-hand side of the bus, a few seats down from the runaway, and Lily sat across from me.

Besides our already established caution and scepticism, I felt like this place was really off. The bus was humid, and a sour smell hung in the air; it smelt almost like meat, but I couldn't place what animal.

The bus's engine came to life slowly, and it began to wheel down the lone country road towards \[REDACTED\].

""Elijah, stay focused; we need to take notes on what this thing is,"" Lily said before taking out her notebook and writing some notes. I reached into my bag and grabbed my camcorder.

The camcorder struggled to turn on. I now know that paranormal events and entities create a type of dead zone for technology or at the very least interfere with it greatly.

I was too distracted by the camcorder to realise that it was approaching until it grabbed hold of my shoulder. The bus driver held onto me, and I felt its fingers sink into me.

I looked up and saw its face staring down at me. Well, I looked at where its face should be; what was there was nothing. I need to stress that it wasn't flat like a smooth option; I mean, there was a hole where its face should be, and inside was a void.

""FUCK,"" I screamed. ""LILY,"" I continued, and as I looked at her, I realised she had her fingers on her forehead. She looked like she was in pain but was focused. I put my left hand on the bus driver's hand, trying to shift it off, and with my other hand I dig into my bag, looking for something.

I pulled out a small plastic bag filled with small white crystals. I opened the bag with my right hand and pushed it into the bus driver, which caused it to flinch back in pain and let go of my shoulder. Silver halide, or ""silver salt"", is like kryptonite to most paranormal creatures.

The creature made a hissing noise and fell back into a chair. I jumped out of the chair, and the adrenaline propelled me towards the driver's seat to try and pull the brakes, but it wouldn't budge.

I looked back towards the back half of the bus, and I noticed the hitchhiker; she was clearly dead. Her eyes were white and milky, and her skin was pale and thin.

""How did it get to him so quick?"" I thought, and I quickly looked back at the bus driver, and it stood up out of the chair and shrieked at me. It was next to Lily but completely ignored her, which meant I was in danger, real danger.

This was the moment that I realised what type of work I was in; it wasn't just going to sites and checking urban myths, it was standing in front of things that shouldn't exist and just trying to survive.

It leapt at me, and I shielded my arms out in front of me. I heard a metallic slam, and I opened my eyes to see it wriggling on the floor. I looked over at Lily and saw her hand outstretched towards the creature, and her eyes were rolled back.

""ELIJAH, USE THE RUNESTONE."" She yelled at me before throwing a cloth sack at me. I nodded my head and reached into the sack and grabbed a small stone pebble that had a rune etched into it. I had always been good with the study of languages, so when I saw the rune etched into the stone, I remembered what the intent was. I slammed it against the bus door and shouted “útlagr!”, an old Norse word meaning “banish”. When said with intent with this runestone, you can temporarily banish things not from our plane.

As I said this, my surroundings suddenly turned to mist, and I fell hard on some gravel. I had rolled for a few feet and was convinced that I had broken my shoulder; I held onto it and groaned. I looked around and saw Lily a few feet away.

""You okay?"" she asked. She held onto her ankle, and when I looked down at it, I realised that it must've twisted in an unnatural way.

""I'm fine. What the hell was that?"" I asked in between shallow breaths.

""A Lophiiformes-type entity. You're lucky; this was one hell of a first case, rookie,"" she said before laying back and breathing hard. What she did on the bus took a lot out of her, and she was close to passing out completely.





I called in to our higher-ups, and they dispatched some backup. A few hours before dawn, we had six people on the site surveying the bus stop. Before long, it was exorcised, and all that stands there now is a bus bench along an old country road.

I got chewed out for using a runestone. For those who don't know, runestones are incredibly rare; almost all of them can be traced back to an incredibly powerful witch in eighth-century Norway who created a couple thousand. How Lily was able to get her hands on one is beyond me, but without it, I'm convinced we'd be dead.

Lily got chewed out for putting us in that situation; her relationship with the organisation is different from mine. For them, I am an employee, but for her, it's a lot stricter. She wasn't fired and was allocated to the role of my partner indefinitely, which still stands today.

For those of you still reading, I thank you. You might be wondering why I am writing this and why I am interested in publicising some of my work if it means it would be censored. Simple. I think I am going to die. Something is hunting me, and it has for some time now, and as a scholar, I wish for some trace of my work to be out there.

Anywho, I advise all who are still reading to please stay away from any thoughts of suddenly wanting to run away in the middle of the night and to especially stay away from any bus stops on the edge of town. You may very well just be prey. ",3,1761100974.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False
1ocwoaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/flrdating/comments/1ocwoaz/28_m4f_australiaanywhereonline_obedient_sub/,28 [M4F] #Australia/Anywhere/Online – Obedient sub searching for his Dom mommy for FLR Dating😊,"Hello there 👋🏻 wonderful lassies I’m a 28-year-old sub gent from Australia, and I’d love to meet someone who’s up for something genuine, curious, and playful. I’m happiest when I’m outdoors: wandering through a national park, ambling along a quiet countryside track, or exploring a museum on a rainy afternoon. Simple things light me up, good coffee, interesting conversation, a song that catches me off guard, or a sunset that makes everything feel a bit softer.

I can be a little reserved at first, but once you get me talking I tend to open up fast. I love conversations that move from the serious and thoughtful to the absolutely ridiculous, and I value someone who can do both. Laughing until it hurts and then switching into a sincere late-night chat is very much my vibe.

A few things I nerd out about: history and applied linguistics fascinate me (I could happily get lost in a book about language change or historical quirks). Geopolitics and agriculture interest me too partly because they shape people’s lives in such concrete ways. Music is a constant companion, and I enjoy the occasional video game for relaxing downtime. I’m curious by nature and always keen to learn something new, whether that’s an odd historical anecdote or a surprisingly beautiful hiking route.

I’m also upfront about who I am in relationships: I identify as an obedient submissive. For me that means I’m drawn to a dynamic where trust, clear communication, and consent are central. I enjoy taking a responsive role when the connection and boundaries are right, it’s about giving up control in a way that feels safe, respectful, and mutually satisfying. I take responsibility for communicating limits, aftercare needs, and expectations honestly, reciprocity and emotional safety are non-negotiable. If that resonates with you, I’d love to find someone who understands power exchange and values trust and care as much as I do.

When it comes to what I want, I don’t have a rigid checklist. I’m looking for someone kind, curious, and emotionally available, someone who enjoys conversation, gentle banter, and quiet moments alike. Chemistry matters more than distance to me, I’m open to meeting people anywhere in the world and exploring where things might go, whether that becomes a deep friendship, a meaningful partnership, or something wonderfully in between.

A few things I bring to the table: loyalty, patience, and a playful sense of humor. I’m thoughtful and attentive, and I enjoy making small gestures that show I care, remembering a detail you mentioned, planning a thoughtful day out, or simply being a steady presence on a tough one. I value honesty and clear boundaries, and I expect the same in return.

If you like hikes, history rabbit holes, late-night chats, and a bit of playful submission in a trusting, consensual context, we’ll probably get on well. Don't have a chat app preference, I’m flexible.

If any of this resonates, send me a message. Let’s start with a conversation and see where the spark takes us. No pressure, just curiosity, care, and the possibility of something real 😊",1,1761100961.0,flrdating,0,1.0,False

1ocwlq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusMentalHealth/comments/1ocwlq0/using_timers_for_productivity_a_personal/,Using Timers for Productivity: A Personal Experiment,"Lately I’ve had *huge gains in productivity* by using a **timer-based method**. I tried the classic **Pomodoro Technique** (*25 minutes of work, 5 minutes break*) but found that even 25 minutes felt too long for my brain. So I switched it up: **10 minutes work / 10 minutes break**. (in my breaks I’ll usually still do “work” but the more shiny, enjoyable tasks-phone calls, receipts, snack, coffee)

The shift? **Amazing.** The short bursts help me get into motion, avoid *task paralysis*, and *gamify my day* (work → reward → work → reward). It’s changed the way I tackle busy parts of my day, especially when *executive function* feels blocked.

  
**What Is the Timer Method for Productivity?** ***(Short Explanation)***

Set a **timer** for a fixed interval of focused work, followed by a short break — then repeat. The timer creates *urgency* and *structure*, while the breaks help you *recharge*, *regulate attention*, and *prevent burnout*.

  
**Does the Pomodoro Technique Work for ADHD?**

Good news: yes, there’s evidence it *can* help people with **Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)** — especially when adapted.

* The **Pomodoro technique** gives *external structure*, supporting *executive-function challenges* like *task initiation*, *time-blindness*, and *distractibility*.  [Read more on Choosing Therapy](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/pomodoro-technique-adhd/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* Many experts recommend *shortening intervals* for ADHD brains — for example, 10-15 minute sessions can be ideal for *sustaining focus*.  [Psych Central: How to Adapt the Pomodoro Technique for ADHD](https://psychcentral.com/adhd/how-to-adapt-the-pomodoro-technique-adhd/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

At the same time:

* Some people find strict timers *disrupt hyperfocus* or *break flow*.  [ADHD UK: Pros and Cons of Pomodoro](https://adhduk.co.uk/2023/05/11/pomodoro-technique-the-good-and-the-bad/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The takeaway: **Experiment**. Try, tweak, and find *your rhythm*.

  
**My Take —** ***Gamifying Productivity***

Because I’ve played with a shorter cycle (**10-10 instead of 25-5**), here’s what I learned — and what I’d encourage anyone with *executive-function paralysis* or *ADHD* to try:

* **Gamify your day** — break tasks into “work → reward → work → reward.” The short timers feel like *rounds in a game* and keep motivation high.
* **Don’t wait for perfect focus** — shorter bursts make it easier to *just start*, building *momentum* quickly.
* **Adapt the interval** — if 25 feels too long, try 10/10 or 15/5. The *structure* matters more than the numbers.
* **Make breaks meaningful** — stretch, walk, breathe, drink water — *real reset moments* boost *mental clarity*.
* **Track your wins** — use a notebook, app, or timer log to see progress and *boost dopamine*.
* **Be kind to yourself** — if you miss a round, adjust. The goal is *consistency over perfection*.

  
**Final Word**

If you ever feel *overwhelmed*, *stuck*, or *struggle with task initiation*, try using **focus timers**. Whether it’s the **Pomodoro Technique** or your own *ADHD-friendly version*, the idea is to **start small**, **celebrate micro-wins**, and **turn productivity into play**.

It’s helped me *exponentially* — and it might just help you reclaim your focus, energy, and motivation too.",1,1761100751.0,AusMentalHealth,0,1.0,False

**Feeling Stiff After 50? 🤸‍♀️Try This 5-Minute ""Desk Detox"" Routine: (And ditch the afternoon slump!)**

Hey RetirementReady friends!

Anyone else feel like they're slowly turning into a tin man after a few hours at their desk? Seriously, some days I swear my joints creak louder than my morning coffee grinder! 😅

Look, we're all about making the most of this amazing phase of life. But feeling achy and sluggish? That's a *hard pass*. It's tough to explore new hobbies, travel, or even just enjoy time with grandkids when your body is protesting every move.

So, I wanted to share something that’s been a game-changer for me: a super simple 5-minute ""Desk Detox"" routine.

Think of it as a quick reset button for your body (and mind!). No fancy equipment needed, just you and a little bit of space.

Here’s the deal:

*   **Neck Rolls (1 minute):** Gentle circles, forward and back. Pretend you're drawing with your nose! Tension release level: Expert.
*   **Shoulder Shrugs (1 minute):** Up to your ears, then relax them down. Feel that tension melt away!
*   **Torso Twists (1 minute):** Seated or standing, gently twist side to side. Like you’re trying to see who’s gossiping about you. 😉
*   **Wrist & Ankle Circles (1 minute):** Rotate those joints! Key for typing and… well, walking.
*   **Leg Extensions (1 minute):** While seated, extend each leg straight out, flexing your foot. Hold for a second, then lower. Hello circulation!

Seriously, that's it. Five minutes. You can do it between emails, during a conference call (camera off, of course!), or whenever you feel that afternoon slump creeping in.

I know, I know. It sounds too good to be true. But trust me, even this small burst of movement can make a HUGE difference. It's about consistently choosing to add movement to your daily routine.

Speaking of choices, ever feel like you're just not getting enough variety in your movement routines? I recently stumbled upon this really interesting resource that talks about a TON of different at-home workouts, including Yoga that focus on getting rid of the stiffness. **We believe in strongest people.** Turns out, there is this amazing guide, with simple workouts that anyone can follow, it is absolutely FREE! Check it out here: [https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts](https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts).

Anyway, I’m curious... What are some *your* favorite quick ways to sneak movement into your day? And does anyone else relate to the “tin man” feeling? Let’s compare creaky joints and share tips!

1ocwjl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1ocwjl3/i_am_a_paranormal_research_agent_this_is_my_story/,"I am a Paranormal Research Agent, this is my story. Case #001 ""The bus to Nowhere""","My name is Elijah Wiltburrow. I've been advised that I'll need to redact certain things from this statement, not that many of you would believe a lot of this. I don't mean to insult you all, but most people don't seem to take anything paranormal with more than a grain of salt, maybe at most something to believe in for the thrill of believing that something is out there. Well, there is.

At the time of this story, I had been newly hired by an organisation that specialises in the study of the paranormal. I can't say the name of the organisation for obvious reasons, but I was drawn to it for two very important reasons.

The first reason is that I have always been drawn to the paranormal. Growing up, I was fascinated with ghost stories and read all I could on the subject. This later blossomed into me studying parapsychology, which leads me to my second reason for joining this organisation. It is very difficult to get a job when you're primarily a scholar of a defunct field of study. ""Debunked"" isn't technically the word I'd use.

It's real. I knew it at the time, and I sure as hell know it now, but that's not the point of this statement.

My friend and fellow field research operative, Lily Heinz, had accompanied me on my first job assignment. Now, Lily Heinz is a psychic. I think this is important to clarify now before we continue.

She had an episode a few months prior to this case and was “scouted” by the organisation. I use those quotation marks because it was really an ultimatum: work for them or… well, I think you can fill in the rest.

She hadn't been a particularly powerful psychic in the time I had known her, but she was aware enough to sense when some paranormal energy was around. A helpful tool in our line of work.

Now this was my first case of my career, and I didn't really know what to expect. I mean, when you are told that there is a likely paranormal bus picking people up in the middle of the night, well, it kind of kicks any expectations out of your head.

We sat inside of Lily's car; the cold night air was thick, and a fitting, almost comical fog had swept in a few hours previously. Her car's heater had died a few weeks previously, so we both sat in an awkward silence wearing our heavy puffer jackets, struggling to stay awake.

We were parked on the side of one of the few roads entering the small mining town of \[REDACTED\], the street itself wasn't anything special, just a gravel road and high trees.

A few hundred feet down from us was a single street lamp with a bus sign hanging off it; the lamp was off. We both watched the street lamp with unwavering concentration; the dossier I was given for this case had explained that from the hours of 11 pm to 4:35 am a mystery bus would come and pick up hitchhikers.

And so here we are, waiting at 1 am for a bus or something to show up. I remember feeling a certain excitement from all of this; I'm pretty sure it's the only thing that kept me awake. Lily was less enthused. This was our second night surveying the site, and last night we hadn't gotten anything. She was quick to say that this was likely just another local legend that we could log as a ""myth"" in the paperwork, but the rules are the rules, we have to survey a site for at least two weeks if the paranormal entity or object doesn't abide by time regulations.

""Looks like we have someone,"" she said. Her words broke my concentration on the street lamp, and I raised the camera I had with me and zoomed in on the figure. It was a woman wearing a heavy jumper and what looked like a backpack. A runaway, maybe?

As she got closer to the street lamp, I looked at lily, she winced her eyes and looked at me.

""There is definitely something here, Elijah,"" she said with tension.

""How can you tell?"" I asked, but as I said this, the street lamp suddenly lit alight, the bus sign illuminated, and a small bench that I hadn't seen in the dark sat underneath it.

""Shit,"" I blurted out before I grabbed the door handle, but she grabbed my shoulder and held me back.

""We have to watch, this is our job, rookie,"" Lily said to me sternly.

The woman cautiously walked up to the bench and took a seat. She sat there for a few minutes, and we watched, took photos and notes, all protocol. After at most five minutes, I heard an engine coming from behind us. I looked in the rear-view mirror and saw two bright lights approaching from the distance.

An old transit bus pulled up, and the women and the sign were obscured from view. I took some photos, and Lily looked like she was concentrating on something; she had her eyes closed and hand slightly outstretched towards the bus. After a minute, the bus's engines came back to life and drove away, and the street lamp turned off. Lily pressed her foot down, and the car began to wheel out off the side of the road and follow the bus, but after five or so minutes, the bus was gone. It didn't vanish like a ghost or melt away; it just simply disappeared.

She got out of the car and grabbed something out of the trunk, then she walked towards the side of the road and stabbed something into the dirt; it was a GPS pin. a portable tracker that, when turned off, left a pin on your GPS, helpful for when you're tracking things in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night.





We drove back to \[REDACTED\] and stayed in an old motel. It was just before 2 in the morning when I dropped like a tonne of bricks onto the bed. I drifted to bed immediately and awoke to the sound of knocking on the motel room door. I shot up and walked over to the window, looking out onto the walkway outside the door, and saw Lily standing there in a pair of jeans, a black button-up and her red hair tied back into a ponytail.

I looked at the alarm clock next to my bed, and it read 10.

""Shit!"" I remember saying before I opened the door. Lily looked at me and smiled.

""The best thing about working cases at night is that you can sleep like hell through the day. Enjoy it; soon you won't be able to sleep much at all,"" she said before placing a cup of coffee in my hand. I didn't even realise she was holding one. I took a sip and let the warm, beautiful sensation of coffee flood my empty stomach.

""You smoke?"" she asked while holding a box of cigarettes in her offhand.

""Ehh, no,"" I said awkwardly, and she shrugged before lighting one up.

She looked at me inquisitively. She leaned back on the table that sat opposite the end of my bed, and I sat on the bed, coffee in one hand and my head in the other.

""So what did we see last night?"" she asked.

I looked at her confused.

""The… bus?"" I said, genuinely confused, which made her sigh.

""Yes, the bus. What do you think it was?"" she said. I got the impression that she wasn't asking and that this was a test, and so I focused on what I had learnt leading up to this. Even before I was hired by the organisation, I had studied stuff like this for years.

""Well, the bus itself is clearly odd, it doesn't show up on any transport schedule or follow any routine, and yet it knew when that woman was there. It must be parked nearby or—"" My concentration broke. ""Shit, that woman. Has there been any news of her?"" I asked.

""Yes and no. Betty James was reported missing a few hours ago, and from what it looks like, she was running away from home, just like the others,"" she said before taking another swig of her smoke.

""Plus, the rate of people running away is significantly higher here than anywhere else in the surrounding areas, probably related, but I'm not sure how,"" she continued.

""And are we sure this thing is paranormal? Maybe it's just a coincidence."" I felt stupid for asking.

""Rookie, trust me, this is definitely paranormal. I got a feeling."" That feeling she got was what I'd later learn was her own paranormal awareness.

""Ok, so what's our next move? We can't keep watching, we know next to nothing about this thing,"" I said.

""I agree, we need eyes on this thing,"" she said with a malicious grin. The air in the shitty motel room suddenly grew thick as I realised what she was asking.

""You must be joking; I can't go on that thing. We don't even know where it goes.""

""You're right, we don't know dick besides where it disappears and what times it appears. Don't worry, I'm not sending you alone, I'll be coming with,"" she said and threw the smoke bud into the drain of the sink in the small kitchen.

""Till then, write down your notes and statement on last night's events, and try to rest up for tonight,"" she said whilst walking out of the room. She gave me a mischievous look when I realised that she gave me coffee when I definitely don't need the caffeine. Say what you will about Lily and her ""arrangement"" with the organisation, but she definitely knew how to make a joke in any situation.





After a day of tossing and turning, trying and failing to fall asleep, I eventually had to get up and get ready for work. It was 8 pm, and the night air was crisp. Lily drove us out to a diner on the edge of town, and I immediately ordered myself a black coffee.

""Didn't sleep well?"" Lily asked with a smile that said she was genuine but with a look that said she knew the answer.

""Surely I can report you for this,"" I said jokingly, although a part of me was genuinely interested in following this up. She laughed, and after a moment my coffee arrived. I took a sip, and Lily lifted a small backpack off the ground and onto the table.

I can't go into the specifics, of course, but imagine a ghost-hunting survival kit. The closest thing I can compare it to is shark hunting with a spear. Sure, you can harm the shark, but the chances of it harming you are still far too high once you're in its waters, and tonight we were diving right in.

A few hours later we pulled up to the side of the road across from the bus stop, the same spot as last night. We both got out, photographed the bus stop and walked over. The light for some reason didn't turn on when we approached, but we both had torches and a small wind-up lamp that had some power to it.

We waited for what felt like hours as we sat at the bus stop, and eventually, to what felt like our luck, the light lit up.

""Something is definitely here,"" Lily said, and as I looked at her, she held two fingers against her left eyebrow, as if there was tension there.

""Ehh, hello?"" A voice said from the left of us. I look over, and a young man, maybe 19, was standing there with a large bag and a puffer jacket. Shit, it wasn't waiting for anyone; it was waiting for people running away.

""Hey bud, how are you?"" I said in the friendliest tone I could, which I now realise would've been extremely unnerving considering the circumstances. I was only a few years older than this guy, and I tried to seem as natural as possible.

""I'm… good,"" the runaway said whilst still standing a few metres away.

""Elijah, heads up,"" Lily said silently after she placed a hand on my shoulder. I looked up at her, and she nodded her head towards the distance where two headlights shone towards us.

""So what brings you out of town? Going on a trip?"" I said as naturally as I could. Lily later told me that I weirded even her out.

""N-no… I just need to get out of this town, y'know,"" he said after a long moment.

The bus passed me and Lily and stopped directly in front of the runaway. This thing really had a target, but we both jogged over to the runaway and lined up behind him. The runaway was the first to enter, and after he stepped on, the door tried to shut but stopped midway through before slowly opening again, almost like it was reluctant to let us on.

We stepped up the steep metallic steps, and I tried to get a look at the bus driver, but from all I could see in the very dark bus was that he wore a typical bus driver uniform and sunglasses. He made no moves to greet or even acknowledge us. Lily was behind me, and after walking slowly down the aisle, I sat on the middle left-hand side of the bus, a few seats down from the runaway, and Lily sat across from me.

Besides our already established caution and scepticism, I felt like this place was really off. The bus was humid, and a sour smell hung in the air; it smelt almost like meat, but I couldn't place what animal.

The bus's engine came to life slowly, and it began to wheel down the lone country road towards \[REDACTED\].

""Elijah, stay focused; we need to take notes on what this thing is,"" Lily said before taking out her notebook and writing some notes. I reached into my bag and grabbed my camcorder.

The camcorder struggled to turn on. I now know that paranormal events and entities create a type of dead zone for technology or at the very least interfere with it greatly.

I was too distracted by the camcorder to realise that it was approaching until it grabbed hold of my shoulder. The bus driver held onto me, and I felt its fingers sink into me.

I looked up and saw its face staring down at me. Well, I looked at where its face should be; what was there was nothing. I need to stress that it wasn't flat like a smooth option; I mean, there was a hole where its face should be, and inside was a void.

""FUCK,"" I screamed. ""LILY,"" I continued, and as I looked at her, I realised she had her fingers on her forehead. She looked like she was in pain but was focused. I put my left hand on the bus driver's hand, trying to shift it off, and with my other hand I dig into my bag, looking for something.

I pulled out a small plastic bag filled with small white crystals. I opened the bag with my right hand and pushed it into the bus driver, which caused it to flinch back in pain and let go of my shoulder. Silver halide, or ""silver salt"", is like kryptonite to most paranormal creatures.

The creature made a hissing noise and fell back into a chair. I jumped out of the chair, and the adrenaline propelled me towards the driver's seat to try and pull the brakes, but it wouldn't budge.

I looked back towards the back half of the bus, and I noticed the hitchhiker; she was clearly dead. Her eyes were white and milky, and her skin was pale and thin.

""How did it get to him so quick?"" I thought, and I quickly looked back at the bus driver, and it stood up out of the chair and shrieked at me. It was next to Lily but completely ignored her, which meant I was in danger, real danger.

This was the moment that I realised what type of work I was in; it wasn't just going to sites and checking urban myths, it was standing in front of things that shouldn't exist and just trying to survive.

It leapt at me, and I shielded my arms out in front of me. I heard a metallic slam, and I opened my eyes to see it wriggling on the floor. I looked over at Lily and saw her hand outstretched towards the creature, and her eyes were rolled back.

""ELIJAH, USE THE RUNESTONE."" She yelled at me before throwing a cloth sack at me. I nodded my head and reached into the sack and grabbed a small stone pebble that had a rune etched into it. I had always been good with the study of languages, so when I saw the rune etched into the stone, I remembered what the intent was. I slammed it against the bus door and shouted “útlagr!”, an old Norse word meaning “banish”. When said with intent with this runestone, you can temporarily banish things not from our plane.

As I said this, my surroundings suddenly turned to mist, and I fell hard on some gravel. I had rolled for a few feet and was convinced that I had broken my shoulder; I held onto it and groaned. I looked around and saw Lily a few feet away.

""You okay?"" she asked. She held onto her ankle, and when I looked down at it, I realised that it must've twisted in an unnatural way.

""I'm fine. What the hell was that?"" I asked in between shallow breaths.

""A Lophiiformes-type entity. You're lucky; this was one hell of a first case, rookie,"" she said before laying back and breathing hard. What she did on the bus took a lot out of her, and she was close to passing out completely.





I called in to our higher-ups, and they dispatched some backup. A few hours before dawn, we had six people on the site surveying the bus stop. Before long, it was exorcised, and all that stands there now is a bus bench along an old country road.

I got chewed out for using a runestone. For those who don't know, runestones are incredibly rare; almost all of them can be traced back to an incredibly powerful witch in eighth-century Norway who created a couple thousand. How Lily was able to get her hands on one is beyond me, but without it, I'm convinced we'd be dead.

Lily got chewed out for putting us in that situation; her relationship with the organisation is different from mine. For them, I am an employee, but for her, it's a lot stricter. She wasn't fired and was allocated to the role of my partner indefinitely, which still stands today.

For those of you still reading, I thank you. You might be wondering why I am writing this and why I am interested in publicising some of my work if it means it would be censored. Simple. I think I am going to die. Something is hunting me, and it has for some time now, and as a scholar, I wish for some trace of my work to be out there.

Anywho, I advise all who are still reading to please stay away from any thoughts of suddenly wanting to run away in the middle of the night and to especially stay away from any bus stops on the edge of town. You may very well just be prey. ",3,1761100577.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

1ocwjdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/RetirementReady/comments/1ocwjdp/feeling_stiff_lately_daily_stretching_vs_gentle/,Feeling Stiff Lately? 🤔 Daily Stretching vs. Gentle Yoga: Which One Keeps You Moving & Grooving After 50? (Results in Just 2 Weeks!),"Hey RetirementReady friends!

Ever wake up feeling like you're auditioning for the Tin Man in *The Wizard of Oz*? I know I have! That first stretch of the morning can be... an experience, right? Especially after 50. We all start creaking a little more. So, I've been experimenting lately, trying to figure out the best way to keep my body feeling good and mobile as I navigate retirement life.

My question to you is: stretching or gentle yoga? Which one is the real winner?

For the past two weeks, I've been giving both a shot, and honestly, the results have been pretty interesting. Here's what I've noticed:

*   **Stretching:** Super convenient! I can literally do it anywhere. Waiting for my coffee to brew? Time for some hamstring stretches! Watching TV? Calf stretches, here I come! It's great for targeting specific areas that are feeling tight. But… sometimes it feels a bit... boring? Anyone else feel that way?

*   **Gentle Yoga:** More of a full-body experience. I love the mindfulness aspect of it; it's not just about the stretching, but also about the breathing and being present in my body. Plus, there are tons of free videos online!

So, what's better? Well, it really depends, doesn't it?

Think about it:

*   **Time commitment:** Got 10 minutes? Stretching is your friend. Want a longer, more immersive practice? Yoga might be the ticket.
*   **Your body's needs:** Feeling a specific kink in your shoulder? Targeted stretching could be ideal. Need an overall reset? Gentle yoga might be more beneficial.
*   **Your personality:** Do you thrive on routine and discipline? Or do you prefer something more fluid and engaging?

Personally, I found that alternating between the two works best for me. Some days I need a quick stretch to loosen up, and other days I crave the more holistic experience of yoga. I even got my grandkids to join in, which is always hilarious and heartwarming!

Speaking of getting started, finding the right resources is key. After a lot of research and testing, I found this great freebie guide that could help jumpstart your journey whether you prefer stretching or yoga. ""We believe in strongest people."" So, check it out here: https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts

Ultimately, the goal is to keep moving and grooving, right? To be able to chase after the grandkids, tend to the garden, or just enjoy a pain-free walk.

What about you? Are you a stretching fanatic, a yoga devotee, or something else entirely? What works for you to stay flexible and active as you embrace the retirement life? I’m curious to hear your thoughts!",1,1761100559.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

The other day, I went as usual, and there was this new girl(who got there earlier) sitting outside with a copy of Never Lie by Freida McFadden, which I've read. She looked up from the book and looked at me, so I figured I'd say hi. I like talking to people there, that's kind of the whole reason I go.

I asked her how the book was, and she gave me a vague answer, ""It's decently good."" I asked what it was about, and she couldn't really say. For context, the book's about a psychologist and they're selling author, Dr. Hale, who ends up doing some pretty wild stuff, kidnapping, drugging, murder, etc. She didn't mention any of that or even know the characters' names.

So I kinda joked and said, ""Did you actually read it?"" and she admitted, ""No, I didn't"". Then I said, ""Oh, so you're being performative."" She got a little defensive and said, ""Well, I wouldn't go that far"". I could tell she was getting annoyed, so I changed the subject.

A few minutes later, her book group started showing up. Jessica asked if I wanted to join since I read the book, and I said Sure. The new girl, let's call her Alyssa, stayed for the discussion. Everyone was asking questions, and sharing thoughts, and what Alyssa did was just repeat what the second-to-last person said word for word, bar for bar. And when it came around to me, I asked, ""Who's everyone's favorite character that got killed off?""

Alyssa, who was right next to me and had to say her opinion first, she froze. She clearly couldn't name anyone after if she had awkward seconds, she kinda snapped and said ""Fine, I didn't read the book, fuck"". And called me a dick for ""trying to patronize"" her. Then she stormed off.

Everyone else just looked confused. I said, ""She must have been having a bad day"". And then the conversation moved on.  Now I'm wondering if I was the asshole here. I didn't mean to embarrass her. I honestly thought everyone knew she hadn't read it, and I was just curious if she'd admit it.

Of course I did.

She told me her daughter had been through a rough divorce and had moved back home. Then, quietly, she said, “I misjudged you. I thought I was protecting her, but I think I just made her life harder.”

I didn’t know what to say. I just nodded and said, “I hope she’s doing okay.”

She looked at me for a moment, then said, “You turned out just fine, didn’t you?” and walked away.

1ocwai2,https://www.reddit.com/r/vtmb/comments/1ocwai2/the_game_is_good/,The Game is Good,"I've put about 4.5 hours into Bloodlines 2, and I can say with some confidence, it's pretty good.

For context, running on Steam on desktop PC, mid-high end specs (5800x cpu, 7800 xt gpu, 32 gigs ram). I did not watch *any* of the trailer content, but I have played through the original Bloodlines about 50 times since 2004. I paid for the Super Deluxe $TooMuchMoney edition sight unseen, with 0 hesitation. Does this make me a sucker? Maybe. But since 2006 I have loudly told people this game deserves a sequel, and it would be hypocritical of me not to fork over my dollerydoos at the first opportunity.

Without going into spoilers, I can tell you:

The good - the atmosphere is pretty much spot on, the music is great, many of the characters are excellent, the dialogue is pretty good, some of the voice acting so far is outstanding (i kind of love Pandora), the story is compelling so far, the intrigue feels like a good VtM campaign.

The middling - I am not the biggest fan of the choices the VA for Fabien made, but that's kind of personal preference. The combat is kind of fucky, but that's kind of expected. Most pen and paper games of VtM aren't necessarily very smooth, combatwise either. The Haven doesn't feel like a home yet, but hey it's only been 4.5 hours. Music kicks in at odd times, which feels a bit off putting. You can only listen to Bet of Night in your Haven lobby - which is a shame, I would like my Phyre to enjoy some late night talk radio in her Haven. MORE CLOTHING CHOICES PLEASE.

The bad - it has crashed 4 times in 4 hours. None at all during the last 2, but its pretty janky. I have put a few hundred hours into Cyberpunk 2077 so that is not about to stop me. It does not make the game unplayable, but I would be remiss not to mention it. The textures on some of the background items are excessively simple, while some foreground graphics (like NPC clothing) are needlessly complex. Sometimes I can feel the game hang between transition sequences that I fear will cause a crash, so I freeze and refuse to move the mouse or enter keystrokes until I feel confident the game is going to play nice. The map function feels dated - a bit like a game from 2012. It is functional, but a bit meh. 

The Uncertain - the game is technically ""open world"" I guess, but much the same way the downtown LA of the original Bloodlines was open world. You can feel and sense the edges of the map, and you can get the idea ""ok, over the course of the next XX hours I will explore all of this."" That's not necessarily a bad thing. Mass Effect Andromeda was TOO open to the point of feeling empty and underdeveloped. I dont know what to make of how they've implemented blood resonance. It feels a bit like an afterthought right now. I would like the option to ""do"" more stuff in the Haven. As I mentioned, I sank too many hours into Cyberpunk 2077, and that game handled V's apartments really well. They feel lived in, with little nothing tasks and things to do (press E to make coffee/play guitar/turn on radio/shoot pool). So far, VtM:B2 only has the jukebox - and only if you got the DLC. 

In conclusion: it's fucking good. I read someone online (possibly on this subreddit!) call it good, but not Bloodlines 2. Hard disagree. This feels exactly like when I played Bloodlines for the first time (right down to the crashes). This is absolutely a worthy successor. It's not GTA. It's not Bloodborne. It's not Ghost of Tsushima. It's not Doom. It's kind of unique.

Right now, I feel pretty great about Paradox owning the White Wolf properties, and am prepared to continue giving them All Of My Money (do not ask how many CK2/3 & HOI L4 DLC I own).

Should you buy it? Absolutely. Do not wait for a sale if you can afford to buy it now, and can run it on desktop. I feel like just being online you risk spoilers and the story and characters are so interesting and so compelling, it might be a shame if it gets spoiled for you.

Is it perfect? No. Is it pretty fucking good? Yes. Can it get perfect? Maybe. Do I expect DLC to add more content and fix shit? Yes. I have sunk the amount of time into Cyberpunk that I have because of the commitment CDPR put into adding content, and it would be nice, but perhaps hoping too much for Paradox to do the same here.",6,1761099828.0,vtmb,10,0.59,False
1ocw8w1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimatePreparation/comments/1ocw8w1/how_do_decreasing_food_prices_fit_in_a_world/,How do decreasing food prices fit in a world worsening climate change?,"So I've been following food prices recently, as when shopping at my local, I've noticed steep increases in some foods but *decreases* in others. This has led me on another research rabbit run to see if it's climate-related, and why these decreases are happening if we believe that climate change should be rising prices.

Take Rice for example. In the fall of 2024, I remember the prices of rice being £19 for a 10kg bag. Fast forward to now, 10kg is around £12. This was super intriguing because I had been stockpiling huge amounts of rice last fall, and my ""value for money fetish"" was tingling at the thought of missing out on savings by buying early. What was happening?

Then I saw the price of pepper in one of my food shops, and I had to blink twice. It had gone up drastically. Other foods such as chocolate were, as we are probably used to, sky high. Coffee. Orange Juice. Etc.

So I checked out [`https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/`](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/)

Now, the obvious trend in many of these is COVID 2020 and the 2022 energy crisis. Those events disrupted logistics, fuel, and energy, causing massive increases. However, fuel prices stabilized around mid-2023. One would expect food prices across the board to reduce in-line, and for the most part, this has been the case for some big staples.

So what is going on with the recent *divergence*?

I tentatively point to human behavior. Take rice again: the stubbornly high price in 2024 (driven heavily by factors like India's export ban to protect its own supply) caused many farmers globally to switch to this crop, chasing profits. Simultaneously, high prices probably changed some consumer habits. High supply and lower demand this year = price crash.

But what about the others? This is where it gets interesting. Those spikes aren't random. Cocoa prices are astronomical because of a devastating mix of disease and extreme weather (droughts and heavy rains) in West Africa. Orange Juice is sky-high thanks to 'citrus greening' disease and recurring hurricanes decimating Florida's groves. Robusta coffee spiked after a severe drought in Vietnam.

What does this say about climate change?

Well, we are economic-led beings. As the climate becomes less stable, I reason that food prices won't just *rise*, they'll become radically *volatile*. It's a game of 'whack-a-mole,' but the moles are regional climate disasters and the hammer is our collective economic response.

A regional climate disaster (drought in Vietnam) hits one crop. The price spikes. That's the *mole*.

Our response (farmers planting more coffee to chase profits, or consumers switching to tea) is the *hammer*. But planting these crops means other crops are forgone, either raising *their* prices or reducing their surplus, causing a *new mole to pop up elsewhere*.

So all in all, if I am correct here, the future of food prices isn't a simple line going up. It's a battle of market forces vs. increasingly difficult farming conditions.

We've 'whacked' the rice mole for now, and I'm sure pepper, cocoa, and OJ will *eventually* come down in price, too, as supply finally responds (or demand is destroyed). But the real question is: what foods are next, and how much faster will the moles come?

And to think, pre-2020, we had decades of not having to play this game at all. This new era of volatility, this constant 'whack-a-mole' game, doesn't bode well for the future of our food markets.",2,1761099691.0,ClimatePreparation,0,1.0,False

My kid is a few months younger and honestly it was nice seeing someone in a somewhat similar state. But truly her content has become so curated to whatever she thinks is trending. Sleep training? Get those views, but actually we still rock and wake up for him. Anti vax? Not surprised by that flag reveal but for someone who worries about their kids health I don’t get it. 
I wish she would go back to the realistic mom vlogs and not just another video of opening curtains, making coffee and being around her kid enough to video.

So my mom and I manifested a house but now we had no furniture. We wanted everything to be second hand cause we wanted to repurpose it or you know, just save something from the dump. Not much luck finding anything but then after I made a sub for desired house, there was a yard sale literally around the corner. Spent $80 for a table with chairs, a coffee table with 2 side tables, secretary desk and a really nice cherry wood bookcase. I also found some really cool brass chess pieces that are like the size of bookends. I’m just so excited about these results cause I was worried we’d never furnish our house but now there’s movement!!!!

New green bean importer from Ethiopia here. For the people here who have seen green import businesses go wrong, I wanted to ask what specifically did not work and what should have been done differently. I would appreciate any learnings as I launch this project. I really do appreciate how helpful and supportive everyone has been in this thread. 

Context is that I’m an Ethiopian coffee producer and were thinking of having an import business in the US with the help of our family.

If it matters, I'm a 168 cm tall, plus size (XL-XXL sa Uniqlo women lol), four-eyed girly (astig(matism) kasi ako haha). I'm working as a legal professional.

You could be anyone (or anything lol) basta respectful, maraming kwento, and hindi boring kausap. Also, please don't be a DDS or BBM supporter.
