Being each other's reason to smile while texting, silly jokes, bantering and laughing together, being affectionate and having sometimes super absurd and sometimes deep almost philosophical conversations about anything and nothing. But also things like going on road trips and other fun adventures.

I am 26 years old and live in Germany. I have brown hair, blue grey eyes, wear glasses and I am 1.83 meters. I tend to be kind of introverted, but that changes once I warm up and feel comfortable. A sense of humour is important to me as I like to make people laugh. Making terrible jokes is one of my biggest skills.

I am looking for a monogamous relationship. Long distance is fine for a while as long as it's possible to visit each other sometimes and close the distance eventually. I also think the distance and time difference shouldn‚Äôt be too great. However I can also imagine to relocate at some point.

A little bit more about me:

* Travelling is my biggest passion and I want to see as many places as possible. Thinking about new experiences, landscapes I've never seen before and all the different kinds of food in the world always puts a smile on my face. Solotravelling is great, but maybe it's even better with a partner? I always appreciate recommendations for unusual or underrated destinations.
* I live alone in a small apartment in a big city and work an office job that I like.
* Books are awesome and I enjoy sitting in the sun with an exciting book and cup of coffee on a calm day.
* I like playing video games. Unfortunately I suck at most of them, especially the competitive ones. Currently I mainly play Anno 1800, Red Dead Redemption 2, satisfactory or Stardew Valley.
* Good food is my weakness and I enjoy cooking and baking bread, but I am not good at it and too lazy most of the time. Therefore I also like to try out new food places.
* I am also trying to do more sport but getting motivated is hard. I like running, riding a bike and swimming and also like to try new activities.
* Languages, history and geography are some of my biggest interests.
* I like to be active and spontaneous just as much as being a homebody.

We don‚Äôt need to have the same interests, I like when people are passionate about something and I can easily get excited with them.

I feel a bit better now so should I still worry about it? My check up will be in 2weeks time so I'm wondering if I can just wait till then.

Also, l've been experiencing morning sickness (not pregnant) as soon as I woke up, I needed to throw up and it's been like this for maybe around a month.
I am also constipated and my stomach feels hard when I touch. I always thought this was gas and today is the first time I throw up dark chunks of vomit.

I read some posts from people who just started and most of them are old and didnt clarify my questions so thought to list them out in hope that somebody experienced can answer:

I love coffee.
But when i say that, i mean instant coffee, with milk and sugar.
Recently I am using continental coffee with chicory mix. I like it but i generally use more powder as I like concentrated.

What I realized was, the coffee world is very big and varied. Milk was rarely used for many drinkers? So i thought to try it. In hopes that I would like it.

I ordered channi grind 3 pouches. 
One of them was, attikan estate dark chocolate figs and roasted almonds.

I boiled water. Added 2table spoon coffee. left for 3-4mins. Strained it into another cup. added milk. sugar.
well, it was okay.

Mostly I read that people dont use milk with these type of coffee. is it true? should i try black? should i add sugar?

where can i find some recipies, clearly mentioned for noobie brewing from just chnani and nothing else.

I want to know first if i enjoy it before investing more.

Maybe i am just meant for instant  coffee?",1,1730037657.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

As a first-timer to Colombia I had no idea what to expect - if anyone is considering a trip, I hope some of these details may be useful.

*For context: I am a 34 year old male from the UK, speak very little Spanish and whilst have travelled extensively, this was my first time in South America.*

For anyone weighing up choosing between Bogot√° and Medell√≠n, I'd opt for a stint in both. If you want to party and prefer warmer weather (this is likely to be the majority of the population), you should weigh your duration in Medell√≠n's favour. Bogot√° is not without its charm, but I'd say you can get all you need out of it within two weeks.

# Where to Stay:

Bogot√° is a vast city - but out of the entire metropolitan area, realistically there is only a small proportion where you'd want to stay.  
I would say there is seriously only a choice between ***Chapinero*** or ***Chico***.

**Why** [**Chapinero**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f19REF7rKYxSbwGr9)**?** *(If you search for Chapinero on Google Maps, it covers the entire area between Santa Fe and Usaqu√©n - for these purposes, I'll refer to the area surrounding* [*Zona G*](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vAsa92h6X6uHvqzv6)*)*

* More lively and ambient, with the streets west of *Carrera S√©ptima* feeling a bit grittier and less sanitised than you would find further north
* Plenty of great higher-end food and drink options in and around Zona G
* Marginally closer to visiting tourist sites in La Candelaria

**Why** [**Chico**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4KHVfZ2TebNyTSN3A)**?**

* A more refined and residential feel, quieter streets, and a safer atmosphere
* [**Parque El Virrey**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gc4zm3VPd6U634h78) is probably the best place in the city centre for running without traffic
* Still plenty of great options for food and drink
* Closer to the shopping and entertainment area of Zona T
* Closer to numerous WeWork locations

You can easily and safely walk between these two districts during the daytime, with well-policed streets. Even during the early evening, there is a good volume of people walking about. The further north you go towards Usaqu√©n, the more residential the neighbourhoods feel, but equally, they lack some energy and spark.

I'd opt for whichever apartment you most like the look of and dial in your desired level of ambience from Calle 64 up to Calle 99.

You may be tempted to stay in the 'Downtown' area of La Candelaria. The prices for accommodation are generally cheaper, and it's in what's considered a touristy area as well as the CBD - why would you not?

**Why not** [**La Candelaria**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zLihGBQAhFKNjM87A)**?**

* Far fewer locations for coworking
* Far fewer modern coffee shops and restaurants
* Generally considered less safe, especially at night
* You'll probably end up commuting frequently to the more northern neighbourhoods

# Where to work:¬†

WeWorks were some of the most disappointing I‚Äôve been to globally. Practically no quiet areas for proper work to be done across any of the 7 locations in the city.¬†

All of the sites I went to were more geared towards groups of colleagues coming in together. You can easily find yourself surrounded by 7 people on a table intended for 4, with people playing their meetings through their speakers.

On top of this, all the All Access seating is in loud communal areas. Even by ‚Äòambient‚Äô international standards for WeWorks, these are incredibly distracting challenging environments to do focused work.¬†

Unless you already have WeWork access, I would recommend looking elsewhere.

# Safety

* **It's difficult to make general statements about how safe Bogot√° is.** Throughout the month, I walked extensively across large areas of the city and fortunately didn't encounter anything that would raise alarm. Most areas have a visible police presence with¬†*Comandos de Atenci√≥n Inmediata*¬†dotted across most neighbourhoods. The northern, more residential part of the city is deemed to be safer but is not immune to issues. Following typical safety protocols at all times should leave you in good stead.
* **Surprisingly walkable in the early evening.** Walking around the core arterial roads in Chapinero and Chico felt safe for the immediate hours after sunset. By no means should it be encouraged, especially in an area like La Candelaria, but you needn't necessarily be confined to a taxi on your way home from work or when grabbing dinner. Later on in the evening, or for any longer journeys, always use Uber.
* **Official hiking routes are secure and well policed.** [Monserrate](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3P7LX6DVkVFBGpw36)¬†is highly popular, especially at weekends, with police stationed along the stair path leading to the top. There are more secluded routes at¬†[Quebrada La Vieja](https://maps.app.goo.gl/grGBZj4CdqGzrmtS7), where police are still present but their presence is more dispersed. Assuming you stick to the official paths within the designated operating hours, you should minimise your chances of experiencing any issues.**‚Äç**
* **If you are planning on dating, caution should be exercised.** Stories of men who have been drugged and robbed throughout the country via the odourless drug scopolamine (locally known as¬†*Burundanga*)¬†have become¬†[increasingly common](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/21/world/colombia-dating-app-warning-deaths-intl-latam/index.html). This has led to the US¬†Government producing¬†[official guidance](https://co.usembassy.gov/security-alert-for-u-s-citizens-u-s-embassy-bogota-increase-in-crimes-involving-use-of-sedatives/)¬†on the matter, and dating site Hinge ceasing operations. With all this considered, its probably worth reconsidering the complementary Margarita offered to you on a night out.
* **If unsure about a location, keep an eye on Google Maps and Reddit.** In lieu of knowing anyone on the ground, this is the best way to get an accurate feel for any recent flare-ups.

# Positives

* **Warm, friendly, and approachable people.** I can't recall many places where I felt so warmly welcomed throughout my stay. I lost track each morning of how many¬†*buenos d√≠as*¬†were both given and received.
* **Surprisingly walkable.** For a city with such historical security concerns, navigating on foot felt remarkably safe, with a strong police presence throughout each district\*\*.\*\*
* **Excellent coffee.** As you would expect from Colombia's capital, there is no shortage of domestically produced, high-quality coffee available across the city.
* **Enjoyable local and international cuisine.** Hearty and filling regional foods are well represented across the city, with most international cuisines available, including a surprising number of options from East Asia.
* **Comfortably off the main tourist/digital nomad path.** I was actually shocked at just how few Europeans or North Americans I encountered during the month. For better or worse, Bogot√° rarely felt like an international tourist destination\*\*.\*\*
* **Tremendous value.** If you are arriving with a European or North American salary, everything is exceptionally affordable and generally a comparable quality to what you may expect at home.
* **Hiking on the doorstep of the city.** The hills that characterise the eastern edge of the city allow you to escape into nature when needed.
* **Craft beer is everywhere.** *Artisanal cervecer√≠as*¬†can be found in vast number throughout much of the city.¬†[Bruder](https://maps.app.goo.gl/atWjqmRHTBC61faG9),¬†[Macha](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bi1u52eZna8QFz399)¬†and¬†[Patria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/h9m1wgAyR7ZtYwNQ8)¬†are all worth a visit.
* **The city's tacos deserve an explicit call-out.** Even more ubiquitous than the craft beer, Bogot√° has an incredible range of taquer√≠as. Some of the best I sampled where at¬†[El Pantera](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MVcFpfrH1WtXwsBV9),¬†[El Pastorcito](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n4khiSYfSu89JDCi8),¬†[Tacos Baja California](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aPHsPWDNyhRMv4Jn6)¬†and¬†[El Master.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dJHqamASDVtm6dgB8)

# Negatives

* **The weather is, at best, underwhelming.** The duration of my trip felt like a particularly bad period, with most days featuring some form of rainfall, usually occurring after midday. The weather forecasts are routinely incorrect, with rain appearing and lasting for as long as it feels on any given day. If you are looking for euphoric blue skies and the ability to confidently plan outdoor excursions, you would be better off looking elsewhere. If you are susceptible to the cold, be sure to bring warm clothes, as central heating is not commonly found in residential properties.
* **Not the prettiest of cities.** While the city is not without its architectural charms, particularly the older colonial buildings of La Candelaria, much of the city's building stock is a mix of 20th-century red brick and concrete. Paired with the often cloud-laden sky, it doesn't make for the most appealing cityscape.
* **The sunsets occur around 18:00 year-round.** Given that you are better off limiting your explorations on foot at night, this leads to a consistently early end to the days in the city.
* **Hiking requires some planning.** Due to conservation efforts, you need to book access to the trails in advance using a¬†(terribly designed)¬†[government portal](https://caminos.eaab.gov.co/), which are often oversubscribed. During wet periods, it appeared not possible to book at all. If you can get through, you will get provided with a QR¬†code which allows you access at the entrance. Even though you have to specify a particular time for arrival, it appeared loosely enforced.

# Tips

* **The physical impact of elevation is real.** Its effect may vary from person to person, but even for someone in relatively good cardiovascular health, you may want to wait a few days before physical exertion and gradually build up before attempting any hikes.
* **If you are new to the city or arriving late at night, consider using 'Imperial Taxi.'** There is a small¬†[concession stand in the airport](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hARZkZ3tZXqTR8Gu8)¬†manned 24 hours a day where you can book a private car to your apartment or hotel. If you don't have pesos readily available or any data on your phone, this counter service offers a fixed price, payable by card, saving you from haggling in Spanish. Uber operates in an unofficial capacity within the country, which can cause issues with pickups at the airport. Elsewhere in the city, Uber works flawlessly without issue and with low fares.
* **There is widespread availability of cards in businesses of all sizes.** Aside from purchasing an¬†*Arepa*¬†or a¬†*Chorizo Colombiano*¬†from a street vendor, there are very few places where you'll need cash. Even so, it's worth carrying around a few thousand pesos. A UK Monzo card worked flawlessly, with about a ¬£3 charge to withdraw from most ATMs.
* **Tipping is generally managed through the inclusion of a**¬†***Propina Voluntaria***\*\*.\*\* In most places, you will be cheerfully asked if you would like to add the voluntary service charge of 10%. This further reduces the need to carry cash or calculate a reasonable tipping amount.
* **Most museums are free on the last Sunday of the month.** If you plan to visit several at once, this is a great way to see many simultaneously, with many located around the La Candelaria area.
* **It‚Äôs best to avoid public transport.** The TransMilenio service appears to be well-run and extensive, but according to various sources, it's not renowned for its security for foreigners. Routine trips via ride-hailing apps like Uber rarely exceed ¬£3, making their use unnecessary.
* **A physical SIM card from Claro offers significantly better value than eSIM equivalents.** These can be purchased in-store without the need for a passport or ID.
* **Stark Smart Gym offers a one month pass.** Their outlet near¬†[Zona G in Chapinero](https://maps.app.goo.gl/khEVEHyyJMMeT84o7)¬†is clean, spacious and modern. A one-month pass can be obtained for a reasonable $195,000 Pesos.
* **Rappi &¬†DiDi Food are the main options for food delivery.** Well worth the $4,000 pesos when using Rappi for the 'Turbo' option to get exclusive delivery of your food. The combination of evening traffic and drivers doing multiple stops means 60 min+¬†waits are not uncommon.

[Heavy evening traffic is an inevitability across Bogot√°, with the roads frequently becoming gridlocked during rush hour. Plan your commute around these busy periods to avoid unnecessary queues.](https://preview.redd.it/8b8iovrt0bxd1.jpg?width=1524&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=886f17cd7fc03f171af774a129511d6124d095ba)

[From 7 am to 2 pm every Sunday, 76 miles of streets are closed across the city for 'Ciclov√≠a'. The car-free streets with a marked security presence make it an excellent time to explore on foot or by bike. A road named the 'S√©ptima' runs through Chapinero to La Candelaria and is a great way to traverse the city.](https://preview.redd.it/1iofw1rt0bxd1.jpg?width=1524&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f329130133eb3dd40de5beea8ee6d1d20a8f97f5)

[Even by damp British standards, the rainfall in Bogot√° was a consistent and unwelcome feature of most days.

This has led to the US¬†Government producing¬†[official guidance](https://co.usembassy.gov/security-alert-for-u-s-citizens-u-s-embassy-bogota-increase-in-crimes-involving-use-of-sedatives/)¬†on the matter, and dating site Hinge ceasing operations. With all this considered, its probably worth reconsidering the complementary Margarita offered to you on a night out.
* **If unsure about a location, keep an eye on Google Maps and Reddit.** In lieu of knowing anyone on the ground, this is the best way to get an accurate feel for any recent flare-ups.

# Positives

* **Warm, friendly, and approachable people.** I can't recall many places where I felt so warmly welcomed throughout my stay. I lost track each morning of how many¬†*buenos d√≠as*¬†were both given and received.
* **Surprisingly walkable.** For a city with such historical security concerns, navigating on foot felt remarkably safe, with a strong police presence throughout each district\*\*.\*\*
* **Excellent coffee.** As you would expect from Colombia's capital, there is no shortage of domestically produced, high-quality coffee available across the city.
* **Enjoyable local and international cuisine.** Hearty and filling regional foods are well represented across the city, with most international cuisines available, including a surprising number of options from East Asia.
* **Comfortably off the main tourist/digital nomad path.** I was actually shocked at just how few Europeans or North Americans I encountered during the month. For better or worse, Bogot√° rarely felt like an international tourist destination\*\*.\*\*
* **Tremendous value.** If you are arriving with a European or North American salary, everything is exceptionally affordable and generally a comparable quality to what you may expect at home.
* **Hiking on the doorstep of the city.** The hills that characterise the eastern edge of the city allow you to escape into nature when needed.
* **Craft beer is everywhere.** *Artisanal cervecer√≠as*¬†can be found in vast number throughout much of the city.¬†[Bruder](https://maps.app.goo.gl/atWjqmRHTBC61faG9),¬†[Macha](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bi1u52eZna8QFz399)¬†and¬†[Patria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/h9m1wgAyR7ZtYwNQ8)¬†are all worth a visit.
* **The city's tacos deserve an explicit call-out.** Even more ubiquitous than the craft beer, Bogot√° has an incredible range of taquer√≠as. Some of the best I sampled where at¬†[El Pantera](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MVcFpfrH1WtXwsBV9),¬†[El Pastorcito](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n4khiSYfSu89JDCi8),¬†[Tacos Baja California](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aPHsPWDNyhRMv4Jn6)¬†and¬†[El Master.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dJHqamASDVtm6dgB8)

# Negatives

* **The weather is, at best, underwhelming.** The duration of my trip felt like a particularly bad period, with most days featuring some form of rainfall, usually occurring after midday. The weather forecasts are routinely incorrect, with rain appearing and lasting for as long as it feels on any given day. If you are looking for euphoric blue skies and the ability to confidently plan outdoor excursions, you would be better off looking elsewhere. If you are susceptible to the cold, be sure to bring warm clothes, as central heating is not commonly found in residential properties.
* **Not the prettiest of cities.** While the city is not without its architectural charms, particularly the older colonial buildings of La Candelaria, much of the city's building stock is a mix of 20th-century red brick and concrete. Paired with the often cloud-laden sky, it doesn't make for the most appealing cityscape.
* **The sunsets occur around 18:00 year-round.** Given that you are better off limiting your explorations on foot at night, this leads to a consistently early end to the days in the city.
* **Hiking requires some planning.** Due to conservation efforts, you need to book access to the trails in advance using a¬†(terribly designed)¬†[government portal](https://caminos.eaab.gov.co/), which are often oversubscribed. During wet periods, it appeared not possible to book at all. If you can get through, you will get provided with a QR¬†code which allows you access at the entrance. Even though you have to specify a particular time for arrival, it appeared loosely enforced.

# Tips

* **The physical impact of elevation is real.** Its effect may vary from person to person, but even for someone in relatively good cardiovascular health, you may want to wait a few days before physical exertion and gradually build up before attempting any hikes.
* **If you are new to the city or arriving late at night, consider using 'Imperial Taxi.'** There is a small¬†[concession stand in the airport](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hARZkZ3tZXqTR8Gu8)¬†manned 24 hours a day where you can book a private car to your apartment or hotel. If you don't have pesos readily available or any data on your phone, this counter service offers a fixed price, payable by card, saving you from haggling in Spanish. Uber operates in an unofficial capacity within the country, which can cause issues with pickups at the airport. Elsewhere in the city, Uber works flawlessly without issue and with low fares.
* **There is widespread availability of cards in businesses of all sizes.** Aside from purchasing an¬†*Arepa*¬†or a¬†*Chorizo Colombiano*¬†from a street vendor, there are very few places where you'll need cash. Even so, it's worth carrying around a few thousand pesos. A UK Monzo card worked flawlessly, with about a ¬£3 charge to withdraw from most ATMs.
* **Tipping is generally managed through the inclusion of a**¬†***Propina Voluntaria***\*\*.\*\* In most places, you will be cheerfully asked if you would like to add the voluntary service charge of 10%. This further reduces the need to carry cash or calculate a reasonable tipping amount.
* **Most museums are free on the last Sunday of the month.** If you plan to visit several at once, this is a great way to see many simultaneously, with many located around the La Candelaria area.
* **It‚Äôs best to avoid public transport.** The TransMilenio service appears to be well-run and extensive, but according to various sources, it's not renowned for its security for foreigners. Routine trips via ride-hailing apps like Uber rarely exceed ¬£3, making their use unnecessary.
* **A physical SIM card from Claro offers significantly better value than eSIM equivalents.** These can be purchased in-store without the need for a passport or ID.
* **Stark Smart Gym offers a one month pass.** Their outlet near¬†[Zona G in Chapinero](https://maps.app.goo.gl/khEVEHyyJMMeT84o7)¬†is clean, spacious and modern. A one-month pass can be obtained for a reasonable $195,000 Pesos.
* **Rappi &¬†DiDi Food are the main options for food delivery.** Well worth the $4,000 pesos when using Rappi for the 'Turbo' option to get exclusive delivery of your food. The combination of evening traffic and drivers doing multiple stops means 60 min+¬†waits are not uncommon.

[Heavy evening traffic is an inevitability across Bogot√°, with the roads frequently becoming gridlocked during rush hour. Plan your commute around these busy periods to avoid unnecessary queues.](https://preview.redd.it/8b8iovrt0bxd1.jpg?width=1524&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=886f17cd7fc03f171af774a129511d6124d095ba)

[Reminiscent of a full English breakfast in terms of size and scope, the 'bandeja paisa' is surely a contender for the world's most filling meal.

[From 7 am to 2 pm every Sunday, 76 miles of streets are closed across the city for 'Ciclov√≠a'. The car-free streets with a marked security presence make it an excellent time to explore on foot or by bike. A road named the 'S√©ptima' runs through Chapinero to La Candelaria and is a great way to traverse the city.](https://preview.redd.it/1iofw1rt0bxd1.jpg?width=1524&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f329130133eb3dd40de5beea8ee6d1d20a8f97f5)

[Even by damp British standards, the rainfall in Bogot√° was a consistent and unwelcome feature of most days. Weather forecasts are fickle, making it difficult to plan for any outdoor adventures.](https://preview.redd.it/y1xr4vrt0bxd1.jpg?width=1524&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98b2cf2f8b129d5df20df0b159a57da25823bbd1)",2,1730037269.0,Bogota,0,0.75,False

I (F27) don't live alone, I live with other relatives din so it's not completely private pero we stay sa room ko. It's been going on since last May and ever since nagka aircon ako, madalang na kami nag de-date sa labas. Mas prefer niya sa kwarto lang kasi malamig and nakakatulog kami pareho since I come from a night shift the day before. The closest we ever come to a date siguro is whenever we buy coffee from a nearby cafe. Kahit yun, madalang na din namin gawin. We're both 27 btw, and 5 years together. 

From time to time, I'm okay with it kasi less gastos and tulog lang kami maghapon which means we get more rest. I'm not bored, I enjoy our chill moments. But I do miss the times na we would actually date. Pag mag de-date naman kami, sagot ko pa or KKB. Ang tagal na siguro nung last niya ako nilibre. Maybe last January? Kahit birthday ko, sagot ko lahat (but he did give me a meaningful gift). Birthday niya, KKB. Mas malaki pa ata nagastos ko. 

Don't get me wrong, he's not a gold digger and alam ko hindi siya user. Gipit lang siya talaga lately and since twice ang sahod ko sa kaniya, ako na nag o-offer. Kasi kung hindi ko gagawin, baka hindi na talaga kami makapag date sa labas. I'm not materialistic. WFH ako kaya I get suffocated sa bahay minsan, so I do want to go out to re-set and maiba naman environment ko. We only see each other once a week. 

I've opened up this to him na before and he is sorry na hindi niya pa kaya ako ilibre like before. Ginagawan naman daw niya ng paraan. Sunod sunod kasi naging problema sa pera. This is not the first instance it happened. Before, I waited until things got better, it did, and then bumalik ulit kami sa ganito. 

I help him financially din and give him tips to improve. I don't look down on him financially kasi I see his efforts naman para makawala sa situation niya. 

Pero minsan, miss ko lang din. Miss ko lang maging babae ulit na ilabas and itreat hahaha. Kahit sa simpleng resto or food court lang. I miss my feminine energy.

It's hilarious!"" I said while sipping my morning coffee, looking at my phone. I could finally relax for a bit.

Nasheed didn't answer.¬†

I glanced up, only to catch him staring at his hands absent-mindedly. Dude wasn't even blinking. I frowned and called him again, loudly. He almost jumped from his skin, spilling some orange juice on the table.¬†

""Y-yeah? Sorry, I-"" he trailed off.¬†

""You okay?""¬†

""I'm, I'm fine."" He tried to smile.¬†¬†

I perused Nasheed's face. He ticked all of the boxes for great genetics. I mean, this guy had gotten shit ton of chocolates and letters on Valentine's Day for 3 years straight. I sometimes caught him on his phone, cheeks all red. When I snatched it away, I saw his inbox filled with the craziest confessions. I jokingly said that his fans would probably open a shrine one day. On top of that, his family was super rich. Dream life, no?

So when I told you that Nasheed resembled a ghost, take it literally. Sunken, hollow eyes devoid of life. His usually slick hair was now unkempt. Sallow, pearly skin. Cheekbones so protruding that they'd make a model jealous. The hell?

""Man, what's up? Are you feeling sick?""

Nasheed rubbed his temples.

And then I saw it.¬†



For a second.



His eyes turned dark.



Just for a second. Then normal again. Probably a trick of light?



He sighed.

¬†""I don't know, Nibir. I've been feeling terrible for the past 4 days. You were busy with coursework, that's why I didn't bother you.""

¬†Well, this was an excuse. I knew that Nasheed refrained from sharing his problems with anyone, but damn, this seemed serious. The mountains of deadlines I had prevented me from noticing such a drastic change. His voice, which was as beautiful as his name, sounded hoarse. I got up and came to his side. When I put my hand on Nasheed's shoulder, I was surprised by how cold it felt, even through the thick fabric. He flinched slightly.¬†

""I am booking an appointment. I'll break your jaw if you say no.""¬†



The doctor concluded that Nasheed was just extremely tired from the heavy course load and that he should rest and drink a lot of water. Yada yada. Deep down, however, I sensed something was wrong. We were talking about the man who worked for 15 hours straight without collapsing (He said he didn't mind. Insanity if you ask me). I nagged Nasheed relentlessly for the next few days to dig out the issue, but he just refused and stated that he was alright. Liar. I'd lived with him long enough as roommates to identify that at least.¬†

""Why the fuck are you being so stubborn? Just tell me, Nash. You can't continue like this.""¬†

Nasheed exhaled with great difficulty, drooping his head. After a while, he raised his thinning hand to shoo me away. Feeling hurt, I stormed out of his room. This was the first time we fought.¬†

I did make small talk after the initial tension dissolved, but it always progressed to silence. Yes, I‚Äôm a shitty friend, but hey, perhaps he just wanted some space. Nasheed had informed the university of his sickness, staying shut in his room all day as a result. We still ate together, but he avoided meeting my eye. His condition remained the same more or less. Even so, I could tell that he was struggling with something.¬†



Occasionally, when I woke up at night to drink water, I'd take a peep at his room. I swear I could see a black shadow slipping inside the door‚Äôs crack. Maybe I was just groggy?

I realised I wasn't hallucinating when my sleep was interrupted by a nightmare. I gasped awake, immediately sensing a macabre presence. I shivered. When did the temperature drop?¬†

¬†With shaky hands, I switched on the light. Nothing-



A shadow.

¬†

Slipping past my door. I barely saw it. I spent the rest of the night covered in my blanket, not getting a wink of sleep.



I had classes starting from 8:30 a.m up to 12 pm . Due to my unpleasant nighttime experience, I trudged through campus, begging myself to pay attention to mundane lectures. I missed Nasheed. It was lonely without him. Of course, my extrovert attitude garnered many friends, but the shy, introverted nerd was the yin to my yang. I decided to directly confront him about his troubles after going home. As I brought out my phone, horror struck me- it was dead. In the hurry, charging it slipped past me. What a lovely morning.

I pumped caffeine in my blood to keep myself pushing. The shadow thing wouldn‚Äôt leave my mind. What the heck was it? Did Nasheed have any idea? Honestly, I was creeped out. As soon as the clock struck 12, I was gone with the wind.

Have you ever encountered complete silence? Like the *absolute* absence of sound. I could hear my heart beating as I entered our apartment. Stepping cautiously, I was greeted by darkness. Mind you, this building let in a good amount of sunlight even when the curtains were drawn. However, it looked as though the brightness was sucked in. I fumbled with the switch. No luck. Despite knowing there was no electricity, I plugged my phone in the charger after my eyes barely adjusted. It lit up. Eh?

‚ÄúNasheed?‚Äù I called out nervously whilst waiting for my phone to display the home screen.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù came the reply. I froze.

Why did his voice sound like that? It was sort of‚Ä¶mechanical?

Bing!

I yelped when the notification popped up. 1 message from Romeo (Nasheed‚Äôs nickname, as you can guess).

‚ÄúNibir, I tried to contact you, but you didn‚Äôt respond. I told Baba to send a car to pick me up. Gonna be at home for a while. And I am sorry for what I did. I promise I‚Äôll explain everything. I just need some time.‚Äù



I stared at the text in disbelief. Who the heck spoke to me just now?



Laughter.



Chills ran down my spine. I strained my eyes to see.



‚ÄúTurn on your flashlight, dipshit.‚Äù It said in a raspy, exasperated tone.

A moving mass emerged from Nasheed‚Äôs room. The temperature dropped abruptly, raising goosebumps on my skin. Two glowing red orbs fixed their gaze on me. My vision cleared for a bit. I wish it didn‚Äôt. This thing‚Ä¶ was shifting. If liquid ink were a person, it would be similar to that. And God, the face. Sometimes it looked like Nasheed. And then like mine. And then both of us, at once. The only features that didn‚Äôt change were its eyes and mouth. It was *sneering* at me, showing jagged teeth.

‚ÄúAw, are you scared? It mocked. ‚ÄúIs poor little Nimo going to run?‚Äù¬†

My heart dropped to my stomach. Nimo was the pet name given to me by my mom. She passed away years ago. How did it know?

The shadow glided forward, standing a few feet away from me. Ever so slowly, I pocketed my phone while backing away. My entire body was sweating profusely despite the coldness. I bumped into the sofa, leading me to buckle up in pain.

It rolled its eyes. ‚ÄúTsk, tsk, you are SO pathetic it‚Äôs funny. I wonder why Nasheed even considered being friends with you. Did you ever realise that he was suffering? Oh, such pity. You are always so full of yourself, how would you notice?

My head spun. What bullshit was it spewing?¬†

‚ÄúWh-What do- do you mean?‚Äù I squeaked.

It let out a blood-curdling chuckle. ‚ÄúI really want to rip out that brain of yours and study it. *Think,* you wuss. Reflect on your friendship. Or should I say, ahem, your usage of Nasheed. Don‚Äôt you fucking dare act surprised.‚Äù It saw my eyes go wide. ‚ÄúHe pretended to not understand your motives. For 3 whole years. He knew you were downright envious of him. Yet, he clung to you desperately. You were the closest person in his life. But what did you do, asshat? When you saw the attention he got from everyone, you were blinded by jealousy. Soooo‚Äù, it hissed, ‚Äúlittle wittle Nibir decided to hatch a plan. He became friends with the timid Greek God and started to incorporate himself in his life. More and more. His admirers gradually became your friends, too, hmm? Oh, why did I forget the girlssss? When was the last time you had a girlfriend? 5 years ago? 6?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are lying!‚Äù I cried. I wanted this to stop. It was getting harder to breathe.

The thing now stood before me. I cowered in fear.¬†

I blurted out, ‚ÄúWho- who are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWho am I? Such a philosophical question‚Äù, it guffawed, sending tremors down my torso. ‚ÄúWell, you could say I‚Äôm a manifestation of Nasheed‚Äôs anger and frustration. He was quite good at hiding it, ya know? He yearned to break free, but at the same time¬† couldn‚Äôt bear losing you. I got attracted to the tremendous negative energy that he was unable to contain anymore. He wanted to protect you, douchebag. Aaaand, you hated that he lived a posh, happy life, amirite? Guess what, his stepmother emotionally abused him in his childhood. He was always told that he wasn‚Äôt good enough. Why do you think he turned out this way?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt say anything. Fuck it, what was there to say? The shadow ceased the alternating of faces and bent down inches from my nose. Its voice became menacing.



‚ÄúListen up, shithead. I‚Äôm letting you go this time, but remember, I‚Äôll always be around. Now that I‚Äôve materialized, I can easily bring upon destruction, ya hear? If I catch you doing dirty tricks again, I‚Äôll *hunt* you down. Wherever you are.‚Äù



With a shrill ‚ÄòWHOOSH‚Äô, it vanished. The apartment was bathed in sunlight instantly. I broke down, hot tears streaming down my face. Utter despair wrapped me from all sides. Eventually, I gathered myself up and texted Nasheed that I was coming to his house to talk things out.¬†



Wish me luck.

My apartment is an absolute embarrassing mess to the point people don't want to visit anymore. It looks like about 10 bags of garbage and just as many suitcases of cardboard just randomly emptied out and thrown everywhere, all my things thrown through the apartment. 

As for diagnostic background I have CPTSD, PNES (psychological seizures), moderate depression, fibromyalgia, and suspected ADHD. 

I just don't manage to catch up with tidying the apartment. Not because I'm just too lazy and absolutely not because I wouldn't care. 

I lose the overview and just don't know where to start anymore. I don't have an eye for he process, I just know two states, tidy and messy. At least it helps a bit if I focus on a small area at a time. I have to touch every single item and ask myself where it belongs, if it's garbage or not etc. 

Then there are the two other problems I have no solution for. In combination it's like I don't have the time and energy to stay ahead of the mess. 

When I focus on a small area I'm really proud and feel good about it when I got it to look better, but it's back to the messy state before I can finish or even just start the next area and before I have the time and strength to continue. 

Then that problem with the energy. I would not even say it's a motivation problem. I'm highly motivated, envisioning what it'll be like when it's all nice and tidy again and I can't wait for the result and for working towards it. The problem is really everywhere in the process, getting started is hard and every single move is like running a marathon.

I literally feel like I'm about to faint from exhaustion after picking up garbage for like 5 minutes. I get lightheaded and need to sit down for a while. My HR and BP are fine though. I freeze a lot, for example before being able to pick something up, with the things in my hands, etc., sometimes I just stand there and stare for a few seconds up to two hours and it feels like seconds and I'm surprised where the time has gone. After these freezes I have to orientate myself again, I forget what I wanted to pick up or where I wanted to put it. I get a lot of psychological seizures from being overwhelmed and exhausted before starting, in-between, and afterwards.

If I manage to tidy for like 4 hours with about 2,5 of them being breaks I'm so mentally and physically exhausted that I sleep for up to 30 hours without being able to be woken up by an alarm clock just like after a long or severe seizure or episode of them or retraumatizing situations. Just those retraumatizing situations occur about 3 times a week where I'm knocked out for the day and at least the next, so I only have 1-2 days left where I could focus on the apartment for a few hours.

Just like today and yesterday I woke up early, I was so happy and motivated about having so much time to tidy my apartment. Then I'm just sitting there, maybe manage to do a study while sitting down and hour by hour goes by without me having the energy to get started. Coffee and music helped a bit today, I had a small energy boost, I looked at the first area and the items I wanted to tidy, I decided what I do with which item and then the exhaustion hit me like a truck again and I had to sit down, feeling like I was about to have a seizure or black out and also got a minor seizure which left me even closer to exhaustion and dissociation.

Then that problem with the energy. I would not even say it's a motivation problem. I'm highly motivated, envisioning what it'll be like when it's all nice and tidy again and I can't wait for the result and for working towards it.

Halloween is around the corner, and I‚Äôve never been fan.¬† I get it. ¬†Kids love candy and who doesn‚Äôt love dressing up.¬† Don‚Äôt we all enjoy watching monsters, aliens, and/or psycho‚Äôs killing hot college kids on film?¬† I guess, much like a lot of things, I‚Äôm just different.

I‚Äôve never liked the taste of chocolate, or most sweets for that matter.¬† My diet has been controlled for most of my life, so pop and chips never really were part of my teenage years.¬† My mom did dress me up when I was young and I do have a few fond memories, but after my dad left right around this time of year, I focused my attention more on staying home and helping her hand out candies to cute little kids.¬† We would watch comedies and romance movies.¬† It became our thing.¬† Us against the world.

I hadn‚Äôt been at her house on a weekday for a long time.¬† It was nice to sit at the kitchen table with her this morning rather than running off after devouring a bagel and some fruit.¬† We sat across from each other, laptops open, coffee to each of our right, talking and giggling while we worked.¬† It was fun but didn‚Äôt last too long.¬† 9 o‚Äôclock came and things got serious.¬† I knew that my mom would be making calls for the next hour.¬† I moved to my room to make my own calls.¬† My first being to Kerri.

She picked up right away saying, ‚ÄúAmanda, I‚Äôve been so worried about you.¬† How are you doing?‚Äù.¬† I said, ‚ÄúAs good as can be I suppose.¬† I guess you‚Äôve heard some things?‚Äù.¬† She paused for a second, then said, ‚ÄúYeah, something about a drunken text from Leah last weekend that‚Äôs causing problems between you and Ian.¬† What exactly did she text you?‚Äù.¬† Clearly, she knew a lot and it was more than what I was comfortable with.¬† I think I‚Äôve said it before, Kerri isn‚Äôt good with empathy and advice.¬† I didn‚Äôt see much purpose in hashing out my marriage problems with her.¬† The fact that she‚Äôs a client as well led to my response of, ‚ÄúIt was enough to make me mad for sure.¬† I‚Äôm just hoping she can clear things up when she finally gets back.¬† I keep thinking that drunken texts shouldn‚Äôt be taken this seriously and I do believe that Ian and I will find our way through this.‚Äù.¬† I think I heard a sigh of relief, she then said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good to hear.¬† If I see Leah, I‚Äôll encourage her to clear this up.‚Äù.¬† I finished the conversation with, ‚ÄúPlease do and thank you.¬† Let‚Äôs catch up over lunch next week.‚Äù.¬† I heard her say, ‚ÄúText me.‚Äù, as I was hanging up.

I took some time to gather my thoughts.¬† I was trying to figure out how Kerri would know about Leah‚Äôs text.¬† As far as I know, I‚Äôve only shown it to Ian, mom, and Alan.¬† Leah would also know about it of course.¬† I‚Äôm guessing Ian talked to her, but I can‚Äôt figure out why.

There is only one lake large enough in our area to have a marina.¬† I called the office and asked if our shop had any boats harbored there.¬† The answer was no.¬† I followed up with descriptions of our 2 missing boats, but they didn‚Äôt have anything like them.¬† I was starting to feel a bit defeated.¬† I was really hoping that they would be easily found.

I went back to my data entry until about 11am.¬† I then got ready and went for lunch with my lawyer friend.¬† I wanted to make sure that I understood the process, timeline and key issues for consideration in a divorce process.¬† I cried in public while discussing it.¬† It was embarrassing and I should have known better.¬† The discussion just made everything so real.¬† My friend was very helpful in calming me down and even found a way to make me laugh before we were done.¬† She promised to send me an email that outlines the process and answers my questions as we finished our lunch.¬† I gave her a hug, said thank you, and asked her to send me a bill for her time.

I went back to working on the shop‚Äôs books as soon as I got back to my moms.¬† I needed to get the job done.¬† It took 3 more hours to get everything entered and it was clear that the past week was a lot less productive than I‚Äôd seen in years.¬† It sucks for the business, but I was pleased that, for once this week, my expectations matched reality.¬† I texted TJ the expected cash balance and he replied almost immediately that we were out about $500.¬† That‚Äôs fine right now.¬† Ian has been a mess this week and probably has some receipts to hand in.¬† It‚Äôs the missing toys that we‚Äôre worried about.¬† The cash balance almost agrees because we have about $90k recorded as being used to purchase 2 boats and 4 ATVs that hopefully exist.¬† We agreed again to address it with Ian tomorrow and I promised that I would continue to investigate the issue until then.

I‚Äôd brought copies of the bills of sale with me.¬† They were standard purchase/sale contracts that we had a lawyer make for us when we started buying/selling used toys.¬† I didn‚Äôt recognize the names on the contracts and other than the toy details there was no other information except for a phone number written on the top of the contract for the most expensive boat.¬† I called it and I‚Äôm still trying to process what I discovered.¬†

Fun fact, the shop‚Äôs official corporate name is something like ABC Industries Ltd. so, even though our business is repairing, buying and selling used toys, our corporate name doesn‚Äôt show that.¬† I‚Äôm starting to think this matters.

I called the number fully expecting Mr. Richard Watson (the buyer on the contract) to answer but instead it was an official sounding lady saying, ‚ÄúThank you for calling XYZ Wholesale Corp., how can I help you?‚Äù.¬† Normally I would have just started talking but the name caught me by surprise, and I quickly said, ‚ÄúOne moment please‚Äù, while turning my head away from the phone to think.¬† I knew this company and I remember them clearly.¬† A few months ago, Ian hadn‚Äôt put his papers in my ‚Äòto be entered‚Äô tray so I just gathered them all up from his messy desk.¬† In that pile was an invoice from this company for about $70k that made no sense.¬† It looked like a 3-page parts order but not of any sort of stuff we would ever use.¬† I asked Ian about it, and he said that he‚Äôd received it in the mail.¬† I then offered to call them to find out what‚Äôs up, but he said he already did and that it was an error that they apologized for and fixed.¬† This led to a little mini argument of me invading his space and him not doing his job.¬† It was bitching at each other, and we got over it.

I didn‚Äôt forget the company though.¬† It‚Äôs one of the things we look for as auditors.¬† There are scammers that just send invoices to large businesses in hopes of being paid.¬† It‚Äôs the reason that vendors need to be approved, and managers need to authorize payment.¬† In today‚Äôs world, AI automatically identifies all first-time vendor transactions, and we‚Äôve always looked at new vendor procedures.¬† I made note of the company just in case I saw it again.¬† Once can be a mistake but any other incidences would be fraud in my book.

I immediately went into auditor mode and introduced myself as Amanda from big accounting firm.¬† I apologized for calling so late in the day but said that I needed to hand the file over to my supervisor tomorrow morning and would get in trouble if I didn‚Äôt have a record of checking in with her company about their account balance with ABC Industries Inc.¬† She was sympathetic and said that she would do what she could to help.¬† She was a bit chatty, asking me to wait but also wondering what it‚Äôs like to work at my firm.¬† She then said that there was no balance receivable from ABC.¬† I followed up by asking when the last payment was made by ABC to her company and her response floored me.¬† She said last Monday.¬† I asked her the amount, but she wasn‚Äôt comfortable just sharing that over the phone, so I said, ‚ÄúIs it $92,350?‚Äù.¬† This was the cost amount for the missing used toys.¬† She confirmed that it was.¬† Having confirmed that I knew the transaction just then, she agreed to email me a copy of the invoice because I didn‚Äôt have time to search for it.

Fifteen minutes later, there it was, a three-page listing of parts that have never been, nor should be, near our shop.¬† All paid for in cash last Monday.¬† I was sitting at my laptop staring at it when the next bomb hit.

It was a text from Leah that said:

***Hey, sorry for freaking you out with my text.¬† I was just drunk and sad that we hadn‚Äôt involved you more in our more extreme rides.¬† Let me buy you lunch so that we can talk about it.***

I feel like I‚Äôm having a psychotic episode.¬† I‚Äôm going to shut down for a while.¬† I‚Äôll update when I‚Äôve had a chance to process this day.

1gdaumc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGirls/comments/1gdaumc/question_about_mixed_signals_from_asking_her_out/,Question about mixed signals from asking her out ? Im M 27 and she is F 21,"I recently started a new job about 2 months ago , i met this girl there that started at the same time as me . Long story short it took me until about a week ago to finally work up the courage to ask her out . At first I had reservations about asking her out because of circumstances in my own life like considering the fact that I‚Äôm trying to focus on my self right now ( going back to school , working , etc ).However I've come to the realization that there will never be a ""perfect time"" and if I never take action at pursuing a relationship there will never be one. Anyway I asked her if she wanted to grab a coffeee with me one day after work or whenever she has some free time, she smiled and said yeah I would like to and to text her so we can work out our schedules ( she didnt actually give me her number, i only have it because we are both in a group chat with our coworkers ) . So the dilemma is that I texted her the next day asking if she was free on a certain day and if not lets try to coordinate something, she didn't reply for three days, The next time I saw her at work was two days after I sent the text ( so a day before she actually replied , which I will get to ) and I pretty much said "" Hey I just wanted to see if you were still up for that coffee ? , since i haven't heard back from you "" and she said ""Sorry about that I've been trying to just disassociate lately from my phone and what not "" ( keep in mind I see her on her phone all the time, and its 2024 everyone is on their phone ) . I forgot what I said after this but I pretty much said "" oh okay I understand , just let me know anytime your down, and she said maybe sometime in November( when we had this conversation it was about october 20 ) . So the next day she finally responds to my text saying "" Hii truly sorry for the late response :\\ but truly ive been feeling off lately, just typical life things hahaha but as soon as I feel better Ill deff let you know "" I pretty much replied and said no problem at all , I hope whatever you are going through gets better and hopefully we can work something out soon, after that we texted a bit about work(mostly how she hates the job). SO that's pretty much the story so far, when we first got hired at the job and interacted we would sometimes talk about basic stuff like school, where she's from, the job etc and I noticed she was pretty outgoing and always made it a point to say hi to me. I feel like ever since I asked her out her attitude has shifted, shes less talkative, I feel like she actively avoids making eye contact with me and I dont know I just feel like her demeanor has changed. I feel like she might have felt pressured to say yes when I asked her out and to be nice just said yes. What do you guys think of the situation ?",1,1730035362.0,AskGirls,0,1.0,False

Yet again I'm excited to share a follow-up post about **aRPG Timeline** ‚Äî a website designed to help you track your favorite seasonal aRPGs and see how their dates align. The positive feedback and encouragement from the community have been amazing, and I‚Äôve been working hard to bring you a top-quality tool that can fit right into your routine for planning the perfect gaming schedule.

[https://arpg-timeline.com](https://arpg-timeline.com)

If you're interested, you can revisit the journey so far here: [first developer update](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1dxe264/arpg_seasons_timeline_developer_update/) and [initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1dvhj6h/arpg_seasons_timeline/).

[Fresh look of the aRPG Timeline](https://preview.redd.it/wbax4f3qlaxd1.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=619edab6646c23f4b9079b188eb18e8f26a0ff80)

**What aRPG Timeline is?**

aRPG Timeline is a website that brings together seasonal aRPG games, tracking their start and end dates to keep you updated on current and upcoming seasons, as well as how they overlap. Each game widget reflects the status of the current season, including its expected or confirmed end date, along with dates for upcoming seasons. For confirmed launch dates, there's even a countdown, plus an option to add the event directly to your favorite calendar app. You can even filter games of your interest and save the setup as a bookmark to keep the same layout at all times.

**Main features**

* Tracking current and coming seasons of various aRPG games.
* Countdown until a new season launch.
* Progress for the current season - how much is left?
* Date and time displayed in your local timezone.
* ""Add to google calendar"" button that ensures you won't agree on a family gathering during an important launch.
* Filters that stay in the url so you can share your favorite setup or add it to bookmarks.
* No ads, no personal data tracking, no hidden costs, zero bullshit.

**Changelog from previous update**

* Moved from arpg-timeline.ayronk.com to arpg-timeline.com. **Unfortunately, this means you need to bookmark your setup once again.**
* Added more games and community mods, you can now track:
   * Path of Exile,
   * Path of Exile II,
   * Diablo II: Resurrected,
   * Diablo III,
   * Diablo IV,
   * Hero Siege,
   * Torchlight: Infinite,
   * Undecember,
   * Last Epoch,
   * Dwarven Realms,
   * Path of Diablo (Diablo II mod),
   * Project Diablo (Diablo II mod),
   * Median XL (Diablo II mod).
* Added more calendar options, you can now add launch date to:
   * Google Calendar,
   * Apple Calendar,
   * Outlook,
   * TickTick,
   * any calendar that supports iCal.
* Game widgets are now sorted by next season launch date, keeping the nearest events at the beginning of the grid.
* Added a timeline widget that displays all games in a hierarchical form.
* Added better support for wide screens and mobile devices.
* Improved UI/UX to represent data visually in much more accessible way.
* Fixed numerous bugs causing the website to crash on various events.
* The data is now tracked in a semi-automatic way, various individually selected sources such as websites, wikis, Reddit, steam, forums and more are tracked for new information regarding seasons, then moderators are informed about anything relevant with a pre-assessment done by AI. However,¬†**a human always performs the final verification**.

**Features planned in the future**

* Support for games that start at different times depending on server timezone (Diablo II for example starts at 5p.m., but on three various timezones).
* Better dashboard customization and sharing options.
* Better automation.
* More widgets and better support on mobile.
* Seasons history for each game (not just current and next but also all previous events).
* RSS/newsletter/discord notifications - depending on interest and cost of maintenance.
* ... you are invited to request new features as well!

**Help needed**

If you are interested in contributing to this website you are very invited to do it.

* I am looking for moderators who could help me verify end and launch dates for various games. This requires very little effort, everything is done using Discord, once a day there is a notification about new updates that moderators may need to have a glimpse on. That's it. You can support this website just by playing your favorite games and making sure that everyone else is as updated as you are!
* Anyone who would like to report bugs or wrong information. Just join Discord and let me know whenever you spot anything!
* I am also looking for developers who'd like to contribute to this **open source** project. The website is written in Gatsby + React + Tailwind CSS. Backend automation is done in Node at the moment but I am open to change it to Python or something else provided the website keeps growing.
* If you'd like to add a game or a feature, contact me on Discord or Github and we can discuss it together :)
* I host the infrastructure and domain from my own pocket and I spend my free time building the website. I never wanted any ads on the website, but if you'd like to support me financially, you can do so bu donating a coffee (yellow coffee cup button).
* Share, share, share, spread the word! If you find aRPG Timeline helpful, share it with others who might benefit from it! The more of us using it, the better it can become, and together we can build something amazing for the aRPG community.

**Is it free? Am I the product? Is there a hidden cost?**

Absolutely not!¬†This website will always remain free of charge, without ads or monetization. My only support comes from your donations and kind words, which I truly appreciate. I prioritize your privacy and providing high-quality free content, and as long as I can manage it myself, I will continue to do so. If I ever request money, it will be for optional features that may incur infrastructure costs, such as Discord notifications or newsletters. These features will not affect the current website experience and incoming incremental updates to build the best season tracker that will ever exist!

**Contact**

* [Github](https://github.com/AyronK/arpg-timeline/issues)
* [Discord server](https://discord.gg/39mTbjkePg)
* [Mail](mailto:arpgtimeline@ayronk.com)

As a closing word I would also like to appreciate support I received from contributors and donators. Huge warm thanks to: lorddusk, savicaleksa, Reeses, Kilniath and everyone actively commenting on the previous posts ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.

Yet again thank you everyone for motivating me to work on this small project further. I am extremely excited and it brings me joy that somebody else other than me would like to use it and I am even more thrilled when people reach out with their ideas or support.

First thing first, me and my girlfriend are together since our high school years. Occasionally we argue about things as every couple, but the last years this is becoming worse and worse.

The previous week we had our biggest "" fight"" yet ( about a thing that's really not that important), and we have stopped talking to each other ... Except from working matters. See ,as i mentioned above we are also coworkers in a small office in our city. Both of us are good professionals so he haven't let our recent disagreement affect our performance at job. 

Now let's go to the hot stuff. The last month or so i was absent from the office  for a couple of hours per day for business matters. 9/10 times i was coming back,  in my girlfriend's office i was seeing the coworker . Chit chatting about his personal life. This dude is cheating on his girlfriend, and is bragging on my girl. He has told her everything. Every girl he had sex with, every girl he wants to has sex with. My girl talk me everything of course in the beginning, that's how i know. Most of the times, she said it was nice hearing to him to ""escape"" from the work , others she was furious because he talked all the time non stop. 

With him , i mainly have a good relationship, we usually take a cigarette or two together during the day, talking about a lot of things. He also likes bragging at me about he's sexual life...

Last week, Monday morning, he come to both of us and told us what we did at weekend, my girl said in a furious way ""Nothing"", and went away. He looked at me and asked me whats up. I , as an idiot, told him that we had a small fight the previous days. He shaked his head, told me that "" you two will never break up"" laughed and went away.

The following days were weird, the atmosphere in the office was not the same, i could tell. The coworker started talking to my girl A lot more. And because of our situation, i didn't know what exactly they were talking to. 

Yesterday, a mutual friend of ours, that works in a coffee shop right next to us, come late in afternoon, to chit chat with us before leaving. The  male coworker was already gone. So in our office we were alone.  I was working on something serious, so our friend started chit chatting with my girlfriend, i was kinda left out of the convo . The talked about a lot of things. At the end before leaving, she asked us what we are planning for the weekend and monday(we don't work this monday, so three days off), and my girlfriend said that she has a really special offer, that she is really considering taking. Our friend asked ""alone"", in which my girlfriend replied "" no no i will tell you later in message, if you want and like the ideas, you may join us""...

As you can imagine i was burning in my seat hearing all that, so fast forward to some hours later, really late at night i send a message to our mutual friend, what my girl was planning. She told me that, she had an offer from our male coworker to join him in a two days clubbing in his own hometown. She didn't tell me anything else, if they will go , if my girlfriend go alone etc. She only told me that they haven't decided yet. The city is 1:30 hour of driving away from us .

1gdaqsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gdaqsa/insight_needed_guys/,Insight needed guys,"So this day, we've been talking all night long over call. A bunch of stuff, just around the surface, nothing too deep(maybe a little thing of two). Well, a thing to keep in mind is that we are not still officially dating. We talk to each other a lot, flirt a little here and then, even make fun of it after making it yk pulling each others leg, basically enjoy each others company. Been a year since we first saw each other, and been almost 4-5 months since we have bumped to one another again and started talking to each other. Another important thing to know is that she has a little commitment issue(past trauma). Even that one time, she had a dream about us where she said some rude things to me and I started walking the other way, she wanted me not to because she didn't mean those words, I didn't look back just kept walking straight. She wanted me to come back. Woke up crying on that. In the middle she said, I don't want you to fall for me. Came with a little scared tone, and i guess working with some of her insecurity. I bluffed it off as: As long as its just me, it will be fine. I remember her saying, ""What if you actually start liking somebody?""... So back to the night, somewhere along the talks yes we might've been to a little strenuous topics, btw its very calm to talk to her, even with hot topics, usually what I don't find with others. So there's been this talk about why I didn't want my last crush, or why I didn't ask for her. P.S. she gets a little jealous, I have seen it in her and I've found it really cute. I being as honest as possible (another thing I really really go honest with her without thinking, something I don't do often, sometimes yes I leave things out, things that don't need to be said, but with her I just blurt everything out like a baby without thinking it twice), at that point, how I was, wanting her would've been selfish. Right after that, I heard her whispering, ""But I am selfish"".  Also she's the kind of person would not say the thing herself, I would have to figure it out and hoping that I get right. She also dropped that we might not have much time as we think. So it was almost 5, the talk before she was about to go to bed, ""You smell warm"" I replied, Yes I know..Im sweating all the time. She, No, not that or stink, don't think too much about it, just warm. Yooo guys, what did she mean by warm??? Im crying. I still remember the last time I dropped her home from her aunt, it was late at night. Her coming out of her aunt's jingling like a little penguin saying she's sorry she was late and I had to kept waiting for her. I told her its okay, i was there just a min ago... Also when she's with me, its like im walking with a kid who just turned her brain off, literally having no idea where we are going or so, just walking with me. So yeah, what does it mean when she said warm? Yes another hopeless dude. 

So all these, the night was 25 days ago. After some days, she texted me with a paragraph, she can't do this anymore. She rage quits on people every winter and said this time I got caught up in crossfire. She said she appreciates me, and I was a chapter she enjoyed, a kind one. But here's a thing, remember that dream she told me about, yes how she didn't want me to go away and also the fact that she doesn't remember a thing from last year's winter. Two days later her pet passed away, and I can't begin to contemplate what she's going through. Winter is a really bad color on her. Not to sound cheesy, I hate the heat on summer, but I'd be down to living in a desert for her. 

Nothing too obvious, those quoted sentences of hers still rings on my head. I still write to her, hoping to send the draft after some time. We had so much planned, how we were about to go on a street food treat, how she was about to meet my 3 yo little brother, how she was about to give me a hand taking my cat to the vet, how I was about to bring my almost teen sister for a coffee with her, the three of us two weeks from now. She was very excited about the last one. Even that night she talking about how she was going to ask her things about me, its going be so much fun, and I replied, I already feel like its gonna be a cannon even for me and she laughed on that. I still haven't lost hope, she's a person I've come to like after a long long time. And to make up for it, im down to wait for her. And Im speaking years. 

  
Any open advice, suggestions and insights are much appreciated. And what does that warm mean, freaking driving me crazy. Hehe. I hope everybody's doing fine. Love ya all famm.",2,1730035029.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1gdaqda,https://www.reddit.com/r/Barotrauma/comments/1gdaqda/contamination_condition_0_oc_short_story/,Contamination Condition 0 [OC Short story],"**Foreword**: I finished writing this short story around month ago, but I decided that recent update would be perfect time to finally post it. I am in no way a good writer and English is not my native language, but I did my best. So make yourself a coffee or tea, get comfortable, and enjoy!

  
  
  
The bright, slowly flickering desk lamp that was barely illuminating dark, claustrophobic room was disorienting at first, but after long hours of waiting, it was the only thing capable of soothing his already frayed nerves. A cup once containing black, aromatic liquid was still held in his hand. His gaze focused on object, visible only for him; hidden in dark abyss of the cell. Neither cameras, nor spectators behind fake mirror could decipher expression of his face, if he had one.

He could last in this state of near stupor for long time, if not the sound of hydraulic doors suddenly opening behind his back, that woke him up from the trance.

‚ÄúExcuse us for keeping you waiting for so long‚Äù Said woman in her thirties, walking into the room with military pace. She was dressed in elegant, recently ironed uniform that already had a chance to bend in few places. ‚ÄúAs you probably know, your presence here has caused us a lot of trouble. The whole facility is on highest alert in recent years. Every compartment from dock C all the way up to level 3 is under lockdown.‚Äù

She stopped for a moment in front of him and placed sealed envelope and many other loose files on the desk. Grabbed handheld palmtop from her breast pocket and took a seat.

‚ÄúSo, Mister Pavel‚Ä¶‚Äù She stopped and took a glance at file before her.  
‚ÄúMerken, Pavel Merken‚Äù He finally spoken. He did not expected his throat to be so dry, which caused his voice to crack.  
‚ÄúIndeed, thank you. As you may be aware already, I am here to find out what exactly happened these 10 hours ago that caused all this turmoil.  
‚ÄúI am aware.‚Äù  
‚ÄúVery well. In this case, shall we begin? The faster we do it, the faster we can all go our separate ways. And probably you too crave some rest, Mister.‚Äù  
‚ÄúI probably won‚Äôt be any more readier than now‚Äù  
‚ÄúExcellent.Please, try to relax, sit comfortably and tell me everything you remember‚Äù She took few small, white pills, grabbed her palmtop and turned on recording device on the desk. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs begin‚Äù.

  
  
  
  
‚ÄúMerken Pavel, born 12^(th) of June 2199 in Meltwater, assigned in Ageron Linea Colony by EASA‚Äôs 4^(th) Expeditionary Fleet to Orca class submarine, call sign ‚ÄúOl‚Äô Trenchy‚Äù, pennant number: ESS-O-7. Submarine maintenance and damage control team, mechanical technician. Sub personnel: 4 crew mates. Captain: Christopher Berling.

We were docked to Navr blockade for maybe 3 days, taking our day off after a long shift in European Ridge. We were then tasked with scouting and scanning expedition into the plateau. The perimeter was guarded by local fleet but no beacons are built there as of yet. Our job was to find a suitable location for construction and eventually clear the area, if further tasked. The ‚ÄúOl‚Äô Trenchy‚Äù was perfectly suited for this kind of mission. She had no great armaments, but she was as fast as the fastest sea devils out there and had great descent velocity.

Other than me and Captain Christopher there were also a medical doctor Paulina Hershell, paramedic without surgeon permissions; and security officer Ana Skolenko, sapper and frogman, she could make explosives from anything on board. Any surplus fire extinguishers? She knew how to drain them from sodium and could make at least 2 blocks of unreliable explosives. Very useful for EVA missions.

So anyways, we departed shortly after we were assigned. Gotta tell you, this whole plateau is no nice place. The water.. so murky if I ever seen one. But I digress. Uhh‚Ä¶ Where was I‚Ä¶ right, Captain called all hands on deck via radio. We all met on the sail and performed a routine check before undocking. Everyone went to their assigned stations and we were on our merry way. Fragile waves were no match for our Oldie.

Mission briefing stated that we were to venture to few points on the perimeter and launch locational and radio communication buoys every 200 meters via depth launcher along the path.

So we swam for around 30 minutes, scanning and launching buoys. We encountered some minor difficulties with local fauna on-site, so we went passive sonar. We reached our third destination point, a small crevasse in ice, wide enough to build a small beacon station, it was the most suitable location to build such thing, not far away from nearest outpost, easy to protect the construction site.

  
  
  
However, as we were closing in to the site, Captain confirmed a strange ice formation. Some 60 meters away from the crevasse, there was a patch of ancient ice that most likely was slowly opening a new way. Following the protocol, we could not just leave it unsecured; within days construction was to begin. Moreover, if we would find an ore deposit we might have been paid extra. Sub made full stop and Captain issued a meeting on the bridge.

Sonar images showed that the newly opening way lead to a cave and judging by the age of ice blocking it, it was probably closed off for decades. Anything that might have been trapped when glacial ice closed has starved to death many years ago. We planned a sortie. Captain ordered Ana to prep for EVA. Shortly after, armed with her trusty harpoon launcher from Earth and few packages of UEX, she was being dressed in atmospheric suit in airlock access.

After checking her every seal and valve twice, she was ordered green to go. Internal bulkhead doors opened, she stepped inside, tested her radio once again, gave us OK sign with her bulky arm and closed the doors. Small emergency light announced that airlock is filling with water. Quite frankly I was expecting to take a short break while Ana was gone but Captain ordered us to stay on high alert. I silently cursed him in that moment, but now that I think about it‚Ä¶ He was a good man‚Ä¶ and we sure need more people like him, not less.

\*Yawn\*, Sorry. You have any more coffee? No? Well damn SolExpress, let‚Äôs hope they will send us some more seeds next time.

  
  
  
So anyways, uhh‚Ä¶ yeah. Captain was overseeing Ana with periscope, he turned on searchlights and external signal lights. She was on main channel, so we all heard her. From time to time she gave us her status report and every 10 to 15 meters she was leaving green chemlights. After a while she reported she planted an explosives on the frozen, rock solid cave entrance, swam 20 meters away from ground 0 with a remote detonator. She started 10 seconds countdown followed by ‚ÄúFlash!‚Äù. I heard, no, rather felt barely notable, muffled bang on the hull, but our seismographs immediately registered the explosion.

Ana confirmed glacial has broken and entered the cave. We started to loose radio signal due to long distance and wave distortion from ice walls, but Captain was watching movement of her beacon marker on nav terminal. Her reports were barely audible through all the static and cracks of the radio. At that point all we understood was ‚ÄúIce‚Äù and something about ‚Äútissue‚Äù, but she was calm. Well‚Ä¶ until she suddenly gasped, reported something inaudible and started mumbling nonsense.

  
  
  
Captain was trying to calm her down and started asking for repeat, but I doubt she heard any of us. After maybe half a minute she went silent and her sonar beacon stopped shaking and slowed down. For next 10 seconds I guess we all thought about the worst. But Ana broke this awful silence, once again reported something barely understandable and her marker started retreating.

We started to understand her when she was maybe 10 meters away from the cave entrance. She requested MedEvac and reported an encounter with something she called ‚Äúmummified crawler‚Äù, or something like that. We all looked at each other and Paulina commented that if there was no other entrance to the cave, this ‚ÄúShould not be possible; any organic tissue would turn into silt by then‚Äù

What? No, no she did not described that crawled. I don‚Äôt know. Probably like regular crawler but old? You know, long tail, two fin like arms and razor sharp jaws.

  
  
  
Um‚Ä¶ okay. Captain reported visual contact with Ana, she was holding bright, red flare in her hand, or in other words ‚ÄúHelp me! I am in danger‚Äù sign. He turned on blinkers to drag her attention and Paulina rushed to sick bay to grab medical supplies for first aid.

But when Ana was maybe 20 meters away from the airlock, she started talking gibberish again, followed by this awful sound, as if she choked on something hard. No, rather as if she was about to vomit, but couldn‚Äôt.Eventually light bulb gave us sign that airlock started its cycle. I and Paulina were standing in front of internal airlock doors with anticipation, waiting for cycle to end.

Finally bulkhead doors opened and cleared our view on Ana, which was standing in center of small compartment, slightly curved, flare still in her left hand; which she was pressing wound on her abdomen with. Suit had a small leak, but Ana has had to seal it with emergency patch shortly after the fight to avoid decompression. Nonetheless, not only water was dripping from the suit. Blood was slowly drooling from her wound; and on the floor I noticed opalescent, hydraulic fluid.

  
  
  
She was just standing there, visibly weak and breathing heavily. We had not seen her face behind opaque visor, she was silent, that fucking silence‚Ä¶ The only gesture she gave, was that she slowly raised her free hand just under the visor and knocked on it clumsily couple of times with her glove‚Äôs manipulator clamp. At the time, neither of us understood what she was trying to show.

She was very hard to communicate to, clearly distracted but calm at the same time. We tried to free her from her suit but to no avail. Release levers were just stuck in place, as if something was forcefully holding the mechanism from inside. We then tried to help her walk to the sick bay for initial examination. Down the ladder,moving slowly, but right outside of infirmary she fell on the floor, as if she slipped on something. It was just like her legs stopped working for a second.

When we helped her get up I noticed a crack on the visor. We managed to lay her on the examination table and Paulina injected painkillers and stabilozine to suit‚Äôs medi-port. After Ana was under IV therapy, Paulina removed emergency seal patch from her wound. There were multiple, asymmetrical bleeding wounds. I immediately recognized crawler‚Äôs sharp but small teeth pattern, but there was also something else. Inside two curved jaw marks there were multiple, three or four small punctures drooling with some nasty dark ooze. As is something pierced the soft tissue with ice pick.

  
  
  
After examination, Paulina considered cutting the helmet open. However, as soon as she finished her sentence, Ana started convulsing violently and writhing with pain, as if she had seizure attack. We both rushed to restrain her, we held her by the arms, I was pressing on her chest to pin her to the table while Paulina was trying to fasten her with safety belts. That was horrible, Ana did not make nearly any sound, not a word, not a scream. This silence was just the worst. I would rather listen to her screams; but as if she was mute.

Paulina managed to fasten her legs with single belt when she finally calmed down. I only managed to wipe the sweat out of my forehead when I noticed something was moving under opaque visor, some vague, unclear shape. I cannot describe it right now. I still struggle to comprehend what I saw in the deep abyss of her helmet. Suddenly, she went limp, her every muscle relaxed. If not the heavy suit, her arms would just hang from the edge of the table.

Paulina tried to examine her vitals, but‚Ä¶ Uhh‚Ä¶ Ana just, stood up to the sitting position, as if on a spring. We all jumper half a meter away from her. Ana was just siting for a while, not moving at all. Doc tried to communicate with her, to no avail once again.

  
  
  
At this moment Captain, probably hearing all the rumble, went downstairs to the sick bay. Then Ana began to move again. Her movements were very stiff, as if puppeteer was controlling her limbs. I and Paulina were trying to calm her down again, but she pushed us away and fell from the side of examination table. Still with her legs fasten to the table, she tried to crawl out of the trap.

Her struggle was almost like that of trapped animal, primitive, as if she forgot she was still strapped and didn‚Äôt know how to unfasten herself. She finally broke the buckle and stood up, standing in the center of the medbay for a moment. We all stepped aside in fear and shock. I once again saw something move inside the visor. We all heard this awful sound, that every mariner fears the most; sound of slowly cracking glass. The crack was expanding, going larger and larger, as if something was pushing outwards from inside the suit.

In the rush of primal impulse I ran out of the medbay towards Captain. Paulina stayed inside with Ana, still trying to help her. Then the visor finally broke. Dark-red, dense fluid poured out of the broken glass along with that disgusting, God awful fleshy, tentacle-like stinger.

Even Paulina backed away. We barely saw glimpse of Ana‚Äôs face, deformed under this strange infection, pale as bone, full of tumor like scars. That tentacle was protruding out of her mouth; I felt like I was about to vomit, but rush of adrenaline stopped it.

Huh? No, at the time I had no idea, but now I don‚Äôt believe she was conscious. I-I hope so. God...

  
  
  
We were clueless what to do, petrified in fear and disbelief. But our inaction was short lived, as Ana began to walk towards us. She swiftly jumped on Paulina, trying to ""bite"" her. Captain quickly dragged Doc out of the medbay, he unholstered his revolver with sheer muscle memory but did not shoot. I closed the doors at the very moment. Ana was banging on the door, making this dreadful, low tone clicking sound. We heard every heavy step of her suit.

What ever she encountered in that cave was no regular crawler, that‚Äôs for sure.

We looked at Paulina. Her shoulder was oozing with blood and the same black substance we saw earlier. She gave us this hopeless look. We knew, all the meds capable of stopping whatever this was, were right in the same room with Ana.

Captain rushed to the armory and brought us handheld taser rods, while I applied first aid to Paulina. We still had no idea what exactly happened to Ana, neither if she was still savable or even alive at all. We were‚Ä¶ extremely hesitant to open that door. We got Paulina away from the medbay, counted the longest 5 seconds in my life and opened the door. We saw her, standing falteringly, almost as if she was looking directly past us with her distant eyes.

Captain made his first move. He took careful few steps and discharged it on her point blank. Nothing‚Ä¶ She took almost 100 kilovolts point blank and shrugged it off, just like that. I quickly ran towards her and discharged my taser too, with the same result. Even with diving suit, such powerful taser would make even the burliest of thugs writhe in pain.

Before we noticed, it has already attacked Captain, which tried pushing it away. I grabbed my heavy wrench from tool belt and hit it straight in the helmet with mighty swing. It was knocked stunned for a second, allowing Captain to escape. He then ran outside and put a few bullets straight to its head and torso while I grabbed any medicine I thought may help. Before leaving the room I took a glance at that Thing. The fucker was still moving, with blood pouring from the hole between its eyes.

Captain sent distress signal and was already driving full speed to the nearest outpost, while I welded the sick bay doors. With Paulina slowly showing the same symptoms as Ana and Captain also bitten I was the only man in full strength. None of the medicine I grabbed showed any notable effect.

Well‚Ä¶ we tried morphine, stabilozine, medical ethanol, but only broad-spectrum antibiotics seemed to slow the infection.

  
  
  
Captain was doing it‚Äôs best steering the submarine out of this hell hole, clearly weakened and with fever and desperation in his eyes. Even to the end, Paulina was trying to aid and comfort us, but slowly succumbing to disease she finally stood up, saluted us and barricaded herself in crew quarters.

We all slowly came to accept, that we probably won‚Äôt make out of this one alive. Captain set the autopilot on path already charted by buoys, blasting distress call on any available channel and sat in his chair trying to look as relaxed as possible, as not to show me that he was as tired as ever. He handed me his trusty revolver and gave me signal to seek shelter away from him.

Still hearing banging on the door, coming from sick bay and seeing how both my mates are being slowly eaten alive by some alien infection I cracked. I locked myself in engineering compartment, welding the doors shut and just waited, trying to calm my mind and maintain the reactor.

  
  
  
I lost my track of time when sub suddenly bumped into something big and sank to the floor. Status monitor showed that whole bow was breached and ballast tanks were shattered. I gave up at that point. I would probably have starved to death or blown my brains out on that cursed wreck, if you guys wouldn‚Äôt showed up. I picked your radio chatter up and rushed to cut the doors open.

The rest of the sub lost power grid, probably due to impact. I put on oxygen mask and with chemlight and Captain‚Äôs revolver in my hands and I slowly made my way to the sail. Along the way I encountered Captain‚Ä¶ or what was left on him. He tried poisoning himself with a cyanide before turning but‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt work. I took few shots, hitting it in torso and then broke its knee with a wrench. It was incapacitated on the floor. I still had one more bullet left in chamber but‚Ä¶ I just couldn‚Äôt force myself to kill him.

I dropped his revolver, ran to the airlock access and blocked the hatch with my wrench. I clumsily dressed in diving suit, ignoring standard protocol to double check valves before EVA and started cycle. Outside I fired red signal flare and well‚Ä¶ the rest is history.‚Äù

  
  
  
‚ÄúThank you Mister Merken. Your testimony will be valuable data in further exploration of Aphotic Plateau‚Ä¶ I am sorry for what happened, I understand your sorrow.‚Äù  
‚ÄúNo, no you don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ all you are going to do is try to go deeper and deeper to who knows what hellish monsters are down there‚Ä¶ ‚Äú  
‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù  
‚ÄúDid you find ‚ÄúOl‚Äô Trenchy‚Äù yet?‚Äù  
‚ÄúNo, we haven‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù  
‚ÄúI fear‚Ä¶ they are still down there, deep in the abyss. In that dark, claustrophobic wreck, waiting to be discovered again. I don‚Äôt even know if they are still conscious. And if they are, I did almost nothing to help them, or even to put them out of their misery. I just ran away, like coward I am. Why me? Why did I survive? Because of my survival instinct? Why couldn‚Äôt I just die like Paulina? Like Captain Christopher? Like Ana?‚Äù  
‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù  
‚ÄúFuck‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶ Sure as hell I won‚Äôt be able to sleep for next few weeks‚Ä¶‚Äù

He finally stood up, barely feeling his legs. Doors opened, blinding him with bright light.

He left his dark, claustrophobic, confession room behind. But the burden burned scars far deeper than any wounds could.

1gdaq2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1gdaq2j/going_to_the_bathroom_postpartum_with_an/,Going to the bathroom post-partum with an episiotomy: how I would have prepared if I had know... ,"Hi! I wanted to share my post partum experience for managing the bathroom after an episiotomy - in case it could help others. If you have tips or different preferences - share too! 

Context: I am currently 9 days post-partum. I have a masters in Biomedical Engineering and so I tend to think about things in a systematic way and I love to learn about others experiences because it helps shape what systems I put in place for myself. So, I thought I'd share all the TMIs. My ob team agrees episiotomies are not standard, but I was in a small percentage of cases where it was indicated to save baby. This could apply to anyone with lots of stitches.

How I go to the bathroom:
1. Try* to go while pain meds (for me, advil and tylenol) are most effective (30 min after taking to about 2 hrs).

2. If going #2, apply ice for 20 min first (I would ice while drinking my morning coffee, I mixed a half dose of restoralax in every morning to reduce need for pushing). Early days, useful to ice before peeing too.

Icing: many suggested ""padsicles"", I personally didn't like the added moisture, and the Frida mom ones are too pricey for my ice needs. I liked perrenial ice packs (2 for 11$, CAD$) which are just gel ice pack. I would cut a post-partum pad (like puppy pad but designed for post partum/human use so unscented and safer), and wrap the ice pack each time for sanitation (25$ for 50, CAD$). Could layer eith tucks for controlled moisture. 

3. If going #2, gently wipe with TP, then clean area with wet wipe, then rinse all with Peri Bottle. I tried to time to take a shower after, or a sitz bath. After either, I would still re-rinse with peri bottle to ensure no soap or other residue remained. 

4. I loved the frida mom shorts, I ended buying a second box of 8 because I liked 2/day changing after showers and I wanted them until after stitches were mostly healed. 

5. Set the bathroom up with a big garbage can, the normal small one isn't adequate.

Cleaning stuff: I cleaned my period bottle and sitz bath with gentle unscented soap and disinfected with vinegar. Then rinsed VERY well with hot water to keep clean. ",28,1730034970.0,pregnant,3,1.0,False

1gdaocn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gdaocn/what_does_it_mean/,What does it mean?,"So this day, we've been talking all night long over call. A bunch of stuff, just around the surface, nothing too deep(maybe a little thing of two). Well, a thing to keep in mind is that we are not still officially dating. We talk to each other a lot, flirt a little here and then, even make fun of it after making it yk pulling each others leg, basically enjoy each others company. Been a year since we first saw each other, and been almost 4-5 months since we have bumped to one another again and started talking to each other. Another important thing to know is that she has a little commitment issue(past trauma). Even that one time, she had a dream about us where she said some rude things to me and I started walking the other way, she wanted me not to because she didn't mean those words, I didn't look back just kept walking straight. She wanted me to come back. Woke up crying on that. In the middle she said, I don't want you to fall for me. Came with a little scared tone, and i guess working with some of her insecurity. I bluffed it off as: As long as its just me, it will be fine. I remember her saying, ""What if you actually start liking somebody?""... So back to the night, somewhere along the talks yes we might've been to a little strenuous topics, btw its very calm to talk to her, even with hot topics, usually what I don't find with others. So there's been this talk about why I didn't want my last crush, or why I didn't ask for her. P.S. she gets a little jealous, I have seen it in her and I've found it really cute. I being as honest as possible (another thing I really really go honest with her without thinking, something I don't do often, sometimes yes I leave things out, things that don't need to be said, but with her I just blurt everything out like a baby without thinking it twice), at that point, how I was, wanting her would've been selfish. Right after that, I heard her whispering, ""But I am selfish"".  Also she's the kind of person would not say the thing herself, I would have to figure it out and hoping that I get right. She also dropped that we might not have much time as we think. So it was almost 5, the talk before she was about to go to bed, ""You smell warm"" I replied, Yes I know..Im sweating all the time. She, No, not that or stink, don't think too much about it, just warm. Yooo guys, what did she mean by warm??? Im crying. I still remember the last time I dropped her home from her aunt, it was late at night. Her coming out of her aunt's jingling like a little penguin saying she's sorry she was late and I had to kept waiting for her. I told her its okay, i was there just a min ago... Also when she's with me, its like im walking with a kid who just turned her brain off, literally having no idea where we are going or so, just walking with me. So yeah, what does it mean when she said warm? Yes another hopeless dude. 

So all these, the night was 25 days ago. After some days, she texted me with a paragraph, she can't do this anymore. She rage quits on people every winter and said this time I got caught up in crossfire. She said she appreciates me, and I was a chapter she enjoyed, a kind one. But here's a thing, remember that dream she told me about, yes how she didn't want me to go away and also the fact that she doesn't remember a thing from last year's winter. Two days later her pet passed away, and I can't begin to contemplate what she's going through. Winter is a really bad color on her. Not to sound cheesy, I hate the heat on summer, but I'd be down to living in a desert for her. 

Nothing too obvious, those quoted sentences of hers still rings on my head. I still write to her, hoping to send the draft after some time. We had so much planned, how we were about to go on a street food treat, how she was about to meet my 3 yo little brother, how she was about to give me a hand taking my cat to the vet, how I was about to bring my almost teen sister for a coffee with her, the three of us two weeks from now. She was very excited about the last one. Even that night she talking about how she was going to ask her things about me, its going be so much fun, and I replied, I already feel like its gonna be a cannon even for me and she laughed on that. I still haven't lost hope, she's a person I've come to like after a long long time. And to make up for it, im down to wait for her. And Im speaking years.

It was my first place after college, nestled in a quiet neighborhood. The building was old, with creaky floors and peeling wallpaper, but it felt cozy. My neighbors seemed friendly enough, at least on the surface. I often exchanged pleasantries in the hallway, but there was one neighbor I never met.

Apartment 3B remained a mystery. The door was always closed, and no sounds ever emerged from within. Occasionally, I‚Äôd catch a glimpse of a shadow moving behind the frosted glass, but I never saw anyone come or go. I asked my other neighbors about them, but they would shrug and change the subject, their expressions turning serious.

‚ÄúJust leave them be,‚Äù one neighbor advised, his voice dropping to a whisper. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to disturb them.‚Äù

I brushed it off as small-town oddity until one stormy night, curiosity got the better of me. The wind howled outside, rattling the old windows, and I found myself staring at the closed door of 3B, the darkness behind it beckoning. My heart raced as I approached, a mix of fear and intrigue propelling me forward.

I knocked softly. ‚ÄúHello? Is anyone home?‚Äù Silence greeted me, thick and suffocating. Just as I turned to leave, I heard a faint shuffling from inside, like something heavy moving. I knocked again, more insistently this time, and waited.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù A voice came from the other side, low and raspy.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm your neighbor from 3A. I just wanted to say hi.‚Äù

There was a long pause before the voice replied, ‚ÄúHi‚Ä¶ Why?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know how to answer. ‚ÄúUm, just wanted to introduce myself. It‚Äôs nice to meet you.‚Äù

‚ÄúNice‚Ä¶‚Äù the voice echoed, but it sounded hollow. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get many visitors.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe we can talk sometime? I‚Äôd love to know more about you,‚Äù I offered, trying to sound friendly despite my growing unease.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the voice hissed. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you should come back here.‚Äù

Before I could respond, I heard the sound of a lock clicking. The door creaked open just a fraction, and I was hit with a gust of stale air. I peered inside, but the darkness seemed impenetrable. I caught a glimpse of something‚Äîwas it a figure standing in the shadows?

I backed away, heart pounding, the strange feeling that I had disturbed something deepening. ‚ÄúOkay, no problem. Just‚Ä¶ let me know if you need anything!‚Äù

I hurried back to my apartment, locking the door behind me, my mind racing with questions. Who lived there? What did they want? But over the next few days, I tried to forget about my bizarre encounter.

As the week dragged on, strange things began happening. My belongings would be slightly out of place. Once, I found my favorite coffee mug in the hallway outside my apartment. I chalked it up to absent-mindedness, but the uneasy feeling in my gut grew stronger.

Then came the sounds. At night, I would lie in bed, unable to sleep, listening to a rhythmic tapping coming from 3B. It was unsettling‚Äîlike nails scratching against wood. I tried to ignore it, but it seeped into my dreams, twisting them into nightmares filled with dark figures and whispers.

One night, unable to bear it any longer, I gathered my courage and knocked on the door again. This time, the tapping stopped.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called out, my voice trembling. ‚ÄúIs everything okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just wanted to see if you were alright,‚Äù I stammered, taking a step back. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been making some strange noises.‚Äù

A low chuckle echoed from within, making my skin crawl. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault. They don‚Äôt like it when I talk. They want me to stay quiet.‚Äù

I could barely understand the words. ‚ÄúWho? Who wants you to stay quiet?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey come at night. They don‚Äôt want you to know I‚Äôm here,‚Äù the figure murmured. ‚ÄúThey can smell you.‚Äù

My heart raced, a primal fear flooding my senses. ‚ÄúWho are you talking about?‚Äù

Suddenly, the door swung wide open, revealing the full extent of the darkness inside. I could see shapes moving, dark and amorphous, shifting against the walls. I wanted to run, but I felt paralyzed, trapped in the gaze of that shadowy figure.

‚ÄúThey want you,‚Äù it whispered, its voice dripping with malice. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been watching you, waiting. Just like they waited for me.‚Äù

We're not technically married, but we live like a married couple for a looong time, including stuff like shared finances, etc.

When we're great with my gf we are really great. The problem is the line between great and hating-each-other is very fine, and we basically can not handle even simple problems together. Last year was especially hard. I had some thought about giving up and ""divorcing"" because for a  while I felt exhausted by the either it's super perfect or super shit nature of our relationship. It got to the point where I actively hide my feelings, fears, bad news, mistakes from her (and I guess she does similar). We alredy tried therapy - very short term-ish.

We are supposed to go to a vacation tomorrow. We talked and agreed beforehand that we will go on Monday and spend the weekend cleaning the house, as it has fallen into a bit of neglect recently. Me and GF started cleaning the house, kids playing on our nerves by fighting constantly instead of doing what they were supposed to do (and she annoyed me by defending the kids - ""they're just kids, don't push it too much, they promised so they will clean it...""). I was cleaning our work desk and got annoyed by the amount of literal rubbish that was left there by her and the kids - we're not talking some work papers that needed sorting out - we're talking food wraps, napkins, ... literal rubish and I got annoyed by that (not saying anything). She noticed - asked me if I am annoyed, to which I replied yes. She immediately got into her ""defensive"" posture like always when something not very nice has to be dealt with, and asked ""Why?"" to which I burst out shouting/crying how I don't understand how they (she and kids) can live in such mess, whether it is so hard to do something and I said something along the lines - ""why should I even take time off work (days not paid) and spend money on the vacation with them if the can not even maintain basic cleanliness in the house"" and left (to see my grandma btw, my GF did not know).

I came back home couple hours later to be met with a total silent treatment and ignorance, that continues even next day. She ignored my tries to talk to her in the evening (we have long before agreed to finally sit down and discuss our finance/mortgage situation). Today morning zero interaction from her side, I made her coffee like a I do every morning and went to get some groceries (she did drink the coffee but did not say anything), cooked lunch for all of us (she completely ignored it), she event went to play some board games with the kids absolutely omitting me (she knows very well how I love board games).

Maybe she's excepting that I will be the one to initiate something, like it was usually the case in the past. But I just had enough - I'm dead inside - I'll probably just cancel the vacation, leave all three of them at home and just go to work. AITA?

**Moms**, when you think of¬†**Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the¬†***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.¬† But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes,¬†**Michael Jackson**¬†was secretly a¬†***business mastermind***?¬† That's right, and if you‚Äôre a¬†**mom**¬†looking to dominate the¬†**entrepreneurial world**, there‚Äôs one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that¬†**MJ magic**¬†into¬†**your empire**,¬†***‚ÄùMomPreneurs‚Äù***¬†a very serious well thought out¬†**business guide for moms**.¬†¬†

Yes, you read that right.¬† Forget the¬†***‚ÄôThriller‚Äô***¬†album; the real thriller was how¬†**MJ**¬†ran his¬†***business empire***¬†from¬†**Neverland**.¬† And what was¬†**his greatest secret**?¬† Multitasking ‚Äì something¬†**moms**¬†have been doing since the dawn of time.¬† He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings,¬†*(probably)*.¬†¬†

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think¬†***the Moonwalk***¬†is just a fancy dance move, it‚Äôs actually an¬†***elite business strategy***.¬† One step forward, two steps back ‚Äì just like building a company!¬† You have to take a few risks, but if you‚Äôre slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.¬† In¬†***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to¬†**Moonwalk**¬†through your day ‚Äì from diaper duty to client meetings ‚Äì without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).¬†¬†[Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY),¬†**it's $13.49 - that‚Äôs 33% off**¬†its original price,¬†**so act now!**¬†

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ**¬†wasn‚Äôt just the¬†***King of Pop***¬†‚Äì he was the¬†***Smooth Criminal***¬†of branding.¬† Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?¬† He wore ONE glove.¬† Genius.¬† Just like that,¬†***MomPreneurs***¬†will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it‚Äôll leave your competition asking,¬†***‚ÄúAnnie, are you okay?‚Äù***¬†¬†

**Moms,**¬†you don‚Äôt need to be the best at¬†***everything***; you just need to be memorable¬†***in your business niche.***¬† And hey, who better to teach you that than¬†**Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?¬†¬†

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you‚Äôre a man) of Your Business**

I originally wrote this for another subreddit but am posting in several trying to get as much input and ideas as possible. 

Update: I asked AI and am going to try something. I hope writing it here helps to stick to it. I combined a few suggestions to one. I will set a goal what I think I can do during one song and make a challenge out of getting this done. I'll keep making the goals bigger until I reach my limit. I feel I somehow need that positive kind of pressure to keep me going. I would still love any kind of input for another time or to try if this doesn't work as I hope it does. 

(Not sure if this flair ist just for sharing resources and techniques, I'm looking for them regarding tidying/cleaning.)

My apartment is an absolute embarrassing mess to the point people don't want to visit anymore. It looks like about 10 bags of garbage and just as many suitcases of cardboard just randomly emptied out and thrown everywhere, all my things thrown through the apartment. 

As for diagnostic background I have CPTSD, PNES (psychological seizures), moderate depression, fibromyalgia, and suspected ADHD. 

I just don't manage to catch up with tidying the apartment. Not because I'm just too lazy and absolutely not because I wouldn't care. 

I lose the overview and just don't know where to start anymore. I don't have an eye for he process, I just know two states, tidy and messy. At least it helps a bit if I focus on a small area at a time. I have to touch every single item and ask myself where it belongs, if it's garbage or not etc. 

Then there are the two other problems I have no solution for. In combination it's like I don't have the time and energy to stay ahead of the mess. 

When I focus on a small area I'm really proud and feel good about it when I got it to look better, but it's back to the messy state before I can finish or even just start the next area and before I have the time and strength to continue. 

Then that problem with the energy. I would not even say it's a motivation problem. I'm highly motivated, envisioning what it'll be like when it's all nice and tidy again and I can't wait for the result and for working towards it. The problem is really everywhere in the process, getting started is hard and every single move is like running a marathon.

I literally feel like I'm about to faint from exhaustion after picking up garbage for like 5 minutes. I get lightheaded and need to sit down for a while. My HR and BP are fine though. I freeze a lot, for example before being able to pick something up, with the things in my hands, etc., sometimes I just stand there and stare for a few seconds up to two hours and it feels like seconds and I'm surprised where the time has gone. After these freezes I have to orientate myself again, I forget what I wanted to pick up or where I wanted to put it. I get a lot of psychological seizures from being overwhelmed and exhausted before starting, in-between, and afterwards.

If I manage to tidy for like 4 hours with about 2,5 of them being breaks I'm so mentally and physically exhausted that I sleep for up to 30 hours without being able to be woken up by an alarm clock just like after a long or severe seizure or episode of them or retraumatizing situations. Just those retraumatizing situations occur about 3 times a week where I'm knocked out for the day and at least the next, so I only have 1-2 days left where I could focus on the apartment for a few hours.

Just like today and yesterday I woke up early, I was so happy and motivated about having so much time to tidy my apartment. Then I'm just sitting there, maybe manage to do a study while sitting down and hour by hour goes by without me having the energy to get started. Coffee and music helped a bit today, I had a small energy boost, I looked at the first area and the items I wanted to tidy, I decided what I do with which item and then the exhaustion hit me like a truck again and I had to sit down, feeling like I was about to have a seizure or black out and also got a minor seizure which left me even closer to exhaustion and dissociation. 

Just writing this took me hour because I needed so many breaks, even if it was not comparable to tidying.

You could say I moved here to 'grow' and surround myself with more likeminded people. 

Some of my old friends are happily married or in serious relationships, with kids and a house and everything (Im single and live alone).

I have virtually nothing in common with them these days and we see each other so rarely that it just sorta feels a bit awkward when Im with them.

They never make an effort to see me, but they still expect me to keep in touch with them, and for me to let them know when Im next visiting my parents so that I can see them too. Just for a beer or a coffee or something.

They sometimes message some random shit to me (like memes) like Im supposed to find it funny.

I'd much rather just not see them at all as it seems like a pointless friendship when things are like this. 

Yet I sorta feel bad for not keeping in touch, it takes me weeks / months to reply to any messages they send me and I just ignore their missed calls.

It looks like the Timemore C2/C3 and Kingrinder get mentioned on reddit a lot as far as low-mid budget options are concerned.

The current prices on aliexpress are around:

* Timemore C3 ¬£35
* K1 ¬£34
* K2 ¬£43
* K6 ¬£75

I'd be willing to pay a little bit extra for the K6 if it really does make that big of a difference.

Ideally the cheaper the better though, and if something like the C3 or K2 would be just as good for aeropress (non expresso) then that would great too.

Brief history- My fiancee is a good looking man for his age. He has a great work ethic and is responsible, has no debt other than our mortgage. I'm attractive and well off. The reason why I mention this, is important because I know it contributed to what happened a few years ago.

My fiancee has shared with me after entering our relationship that his family is a mixed bag, I can appreciate each person's individuality, and I embraced everyone in his family. I respect his opinions about some members of his family, he had loaned each of these people money at different times, but they chose not to pay him back, he's very upset in the over 15 years, they completely avoided, made excuses in paying him back. He avoids these individuals, doesn't go out of his way to have anything to do with them.
 He's disgusted with one of them in particular. However, this is not the issue, I just wanted to share this to show my fiancee has the ability to not be happy with a person and cut them off out of his life more or less. These folks are his eldest sister and a daughter of hers ( his niece).

Let me add that despite going to various family functions of his, I wasn't even introduced to this niece until she actually came to me after several of the functions and she had to introduce herself ( as his niece) I was shocked as at this point, about a year and a half in, I didn't even know she existed although I had seen her, I thought she was perhaps a family friend until then.

My fiancee later explained she had borrowed money from him, never paid him back and explained why he was disgusted with her as a human being. I respect his feelings. I couldn't convince him to let it go...We are cordial towards his eldest sister and her daughter, but like I said, he doesn't go out of his way to associate with these folks.Again, just a little history.

In 2020 near Christmas, my fiancee lost a sister to COVID. He was actually close to this one. His sisters son (I'll call 'Nephew') made an offensive remark about the funeral arrangements and my fiancee was pissed. He didn't speak to him for various months, Nephew and his common law wife took part in this offence over the phone, they were both laughing and my fiancee wasn't. I heard it all as I was in the car during this call. I tried convincing my fiancee that Nephew's joke although not funny was something that he should write off due to the circumstances. The answer was no.I respected my fiancees feelings. We were both cordial during functions... eventually he did forgive Nephew. He also mentioned throughout the time that Nephew had jealousy issues concerning his accomplishments (nephew is a few years older than me, but about 15 years younger than my fiancee)

So Christmas of 2022 Nephew said something that my fiancee turned around and pointed out the obvious about it. Nephew didn't like it ( It wasn't anything that wasn't already known amongst their family) Nephew charged at my fiancee who was sat right next to me, my fiancee got up instantly, picked him up and slammed him down on the coffee table before his hands had a chance to fly at my fiancee. This caused a family fiasco as family were all there from out of town also and witnessed this. My fiancee was ready to throw punches at Nephew but other family restrained my fiancee from doing so and Nephew Jr. Jumped on my fiancee and strangled him before being peeled off.

It took 3 of the stronger family members to restrain my fiancee effectively. Nobody restrained Nephew. Nephew threw a punch at my fiancee and it landed on my fiancees youngest sister who was trying to stop this fiasco ( at her house) . Neither my fiancee or Nephew or Nephew Jr got hit. Just a note, Nephew had verbally invited Fiancee's brother to join in on helping Nephew to throw punches at Fiancee, brother refused.

Of course witnessing this left me traumatized. Later that evening it was revealed that Nephew has been harboring resentment, jealousy, envy etc towards my fiancee for as long as he's been able to. My fiancee had always been helpful towards Nephew and always treated Nephew's son, Nephew Jr with a lot of affection throughout their lives. At the time of this fracas Nephew Jr was 25 years old.

Nobody during this came to me to comfort me, or support me and most of those present were directly related to Nephew and were at Nephew's common law wife's side. Despite my fiancee always having been a great brother, uncle, grand uncle to all those present, when Nephew spewed hate, nobody told Nephew to stop or stick up for fiancee, I'm trying to think it was more to do with not wanting to make the situation worse, but at the same time I was all alone there while my fiancee had been taken outside to separate him from Nephew and calm him. The doors were barricaded.

I'm sorry this is becoming so long, after this fracas, we went home as the evening was ruined of course.

My fiancee told me me that it was later revealed that Nephew had planned to fight Fiancee. The only thing I can think of for the reason was that about two months earlier we bought our home together and perhaps learning this pushed Nephew over the edge with jealousy and the fact that my fiancee told him facts concerning what was said at the Christmas party at his youngest sister's house.

Nearly two years went by with absolutely us avoiding any function where any of the three Nephew, Nephew Jr and Nephews common law wife were involved. There were words about how Nephew didn't want to cause anymore issues and that if attending a function where both would be invited, he'd stay away from Fiancee. Nephew Jr had sent a message wanting to talk about the incident where he strangled my fiancee about 6 months ago, my fiancee ignored it. During a fundraising event for Fiancees eldest sister, Nephew Jr and his dad, Nephew were in attendance, also the wife.

Nephew Jr and wife tried getting close to me to hug me and I walk away elsewhere, it was crowded, to avoid them at all cost. Wife continued throughout until eventually she was able to pop out of nowhere to give me a hug and kiss. Uninvited, unexpectedly and unwelcomed. I said nothing. She again later tried to start a conversation which I just politely shrugged off without saying much and escaping.

Nephew Jr invited my fiancee to talk outside. It was then revealed that Nephew Jr strangled my fiancee because his dad was picked up and body slammed. Fiancee explained to Nephew Jr that the fight was between them and he shouldn't have ever gotten involved as his dad was the one who came at him to throw punches, next time it happens, it was explained that he will not withhold from not hitting him like he did that time and as for his father he doesn't care at all for him, letting him know that his dad will get knocked out for sure next time he tries to attack him, emphasizing that next time he joins his dad he'd better protect himself.

So we attended another family event the other day, while Nephew stays away from both me and my fiancee, but Jr and his mom try to come close to me a few times with no luck, at the same time they have both inched their way to hugging my fiancee during greetings. During this event Jr also makes small talk with fiancee and chit chat about sports. A lady around Jrs age comes towards me to hug me and I find out a moment later this is Jrs girlfriend.

Wife has a history of encouraging Nephew to hold feelings of resentment etc towards my fiancee. I want absolutely nothing to do with her.

Jr. will jump in a fight involving his dad. If it happens again, he'll jump in again. I want nothing to do with him because he will take my fiancees life to support his dad.

That fight wasn't fair. While my super strong fiancee was held back by Three grown strong men, Nephew wasn't. A punch thrown by Nephew to hit my fiancee got Fiancee's youngest sister instead. Cowardly.

So at the event later in the evening we went back for the second part of this family event. Nephew Jr every now and again would chit chat with my fiancee about sports and several times did so with me being right beside my fiancee. I would let go of Fiancee's hand to simply walk away, but Jr did it again, this time I expressed to my fiancee I wasn't comfortable with Jr being in super close proximity to me.I explained to my fiancee If fiancee wants to engage him/ mom fine, at his risk so long as it's away from me, but those three I want nowhere near me. Nephew is respecting distance but not Jr and the wife. My boundaries aren't being respected or enforced.

My fiancee decided we were leaving saying that I was overreacting to Jr being so close to my person while showing my fiancee something. I couldn't leave as I was sat down and my fiancees chair wouldn't allow me to leave them. I was glad to leave the event a, my anxiety was beyond skyrocketing but I feel my fiancee is being dismissive about how I feel about those three, or those two especially since they are the issue.

Let me add that Neither of the three have reached out to me or personally apologized to me at all. Which is an insult in itself- It wouldn't change anything,but I would at least have a fraction of respect for them trying if they did. It also makes me feel like they must believe that I was only a stuffed doll with no feelings when I witnessed Nephew coming straight towards fiancee and I, to attack fiancee before Nephew was body slammed into the coffee table. So far, Jr and mom are ingratiating themselves to my fiancee but that's not ever going to get them close to being privileged to get anywhere near me.

AITA for wanting nothing to do with those two?",1,1730032775.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

 We have a dog named Winston. He's so.. dumb.. I've never realized how dumb dogs could be, because I've always had average or smart. 
These are some of the things that he likes to do lately. 

He likes to sit on the coffee table because he saw the cat do it. 

He likes to chew on the coffee table. With his front teeth 

I caught him eating a wall once. 

He'll jump in the bath when you're taking one. He likes baths to that point

He'll drink bath water

His favorite thing to eat is metal things.. or concrete.

If it has flavour. It must be meant to be eaten. 

He eats shoes, specifically my shoes, I always thought that was something just in movies til him ..

If you're sitting on the floor. He thinks you're sad. & Will lay on you /lick your face until you stand. Which made Reno's hard. 

He didn't even bark. For months after we got him. until another dog showed him how ..

I've had Many dogs over the years. & Never had I had to deal with any dog as dumb or silly asWinston. Note. This has been after training him.
 It was worse. he keeps things interesting.. I never know whats going to happen next..

I don't know why he is like this. I'm not new to dogs. Or training. He doesn't seem to understand. & will suddenly learn new.. interesting things that he didn't do before ..

I feel like there's more 'winstons' out there.. but I've never met anyone quite like him

He is a black lab/bloodhound. So seeing a full dog, sitting, smiling on the coffee table one day was something I wasn't expecting..

1gd9y9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gd9y9j/time_has_stopped_at_vienna_international_airport/,Time has stopped at Vienna International Airport,"I mean, the title is rather self-explanatory. I'm at Vienna International Airport, and everything is frozen in time. All the morning passengers are here, all of them unmoving like fleshy, warm statues. Looking outside through the window, I see a flight departing, suspended in the air. Next to me, a woman is dropping her handbag, and all the contents are frozen in the air, unaffected by gravity's pull. 

Suppose I can elaborate a bit, as, at the moment, it appears that I have‚Ä¶ all the time in the world. 

I was on a business trip in Vienna, and I had to travel back to Paris CDG Airport with an early morning flight. On the way towards the terminal, staring out of the cab, I saw the airport lights in the dim, cloudy dawn sky. Some of the departing planes were awfully slow - almost like they were not moving at all. I was thinking of pointing this out to the cabbie, but I chalked it up to tiredness. See, after-conference ""networking cocktails"" and 6am flights are not a great combination, so I was far from being in a chatty mood. Either way, the guy dropped me off, and I decided to have a quick ciggie before checking in.

While smoking, I wondered about airports - how fascinating they are. A while ago, during my university years, I had a part time bartender job at one, and I always found them eerie. They were ""liminal spaces"": areas of the inbetween, people just heading there to pass through it - sort of a border world. Of course, seeing airports like that could've been Stockholm syndrome caused by this student job as well - after all, I needed some sense of wonder to tolerate five am shifts. And now, many years later, here I am, at five am again, but this time, as one of the travellers, a wandering soul lost in the liminal landscape... I let out a brief laugh - the hangover left me way too philosophical. Yet, the eerie feeling I had turned out to be more of a premonition, rather than a hungover inner monologue-ramble.

Things took a sharp turn for the weird at security. While there were quite a few people, many gates were open, so the crowd moved fast. I got directed towards a freshly opened security station. It was surrounded by tired looking officers. One instructing me to put my laptops, and fluid containers on separate trays, the other two standing behind the metal detector gate, waving me through... and a third one - slightly peculiar. He was sitting behind the monitor of the x-ray machine you put your bags through, wearing huge aviators, basically covering half his face. Ah well, I figured you gotta make a fashion statement somehow, even if you're obligated to wear a uniform. 

Anyways, I was about to walk through the gate - the metal detector, the symbolic border between the mundane and the liminal. But the very moment I stepped through it, complete silence engulfed everything. I reflectively touched my ear, thinking my earbuds somehow turned on noise cancelling, when I realised that they were in the tray - which slowly rolled down on the pickup area. 

And that was the only thing moving. Everything else stopped - like someone hitting a pause button. Odd, I figured. I slowly walked back through the gate, but nothing changed. Everything around me stood still. The security guy's hand frozen in a bored wave, a man putting his belt back on unmoving next to me, a family in the other queue, stuck in mid-argument, their small kid, her face trapped in a mid-crying expression, but no sound leaving her mouth... wish I could do this to kids once the plane took off. Nevertheless, temporal anomalies be damned, I did not want to miss my plane, so I grabbed my stuff from the tray. Yet, as I was putting my laptop back into my bag, I saw one thing - or, well, the absence of it. The security guy with the sunglasses was nowhere to be found. This whole thing did not look like something that respects airport security standards.

Walking towards my gate, d24, in the dead silence was certainly an experience. I moved through crowds in suspended animation (or I sure as hell I hope it was that - it would be rather awkward to be at an airport full of dead people). Still, it had a certain beauty. Upon arriving to d24, an unusual sight welcomed me. The monitors showed that boarding was open - and indeed, the doors were ajar - but the flight destination, instead of ‚ÄúParis CDG‚Äù just looked like a jumbled mess of characters. Now, while my app said that this was the correct gate, I did not want to end up at the wrong location, so I decided on not boarding for now, waiting it out instead, hoping that a staff member or an announcement will clear up the confusion soon. I was a bit hungry, and the nearby bar seemed, albeit overpriced, but fairly attractive. I walked over, crisscrossing the statue-like crowds. I grabbed a sandwich, and - as the staff was unavailable on account of being frozen in time - I decided to walk behind the till to the coffee machine, and help myself to some drinks. For a moment I entertained the thought of making myself a nice flat white, but I figured that if time restarts and I am standing in a restricted area steaming milk, I may get some angry looks, so I opted for an espresso instead. The tiny cup was halfway through when I heard something familiar: the breaking news announcement of Euronews on a nearby TV screen.

Well, something - apart from me - was unaffected by this time-fuckery, so I quickly grabbed my coffee and my sandwich. The total was 12.30‚Ç¨, so I put a tenner on the counter and figured they can keep the change. Indeed, at the back of the bar, there was a tv, broadcasting the morning news, oblivious to the frozen world around it. 

""...chief investigator of the crash of AirFrance flight***** (I have hidden the flight ID, just in case) at Vienna Schwechat Intl. Airport this morning states that at this time, the exact cause of the accident cannot be determined. While the number of confirmed casualties just passed 80, the search for survivors continues. According to witness testimonies, the aircraft overran the runway during takeoff, and crashed into the industrial area of Schwadorf, a settlement near the airport. Authorities have asked the public to forward any information, including recordings of the events to the authorities...""

Rather macabre, watching these news at an airport, I was thinking, when it hit me like a freight train (or like a crashing plane) - the flight they were talking about was the one I was supposed to board.

Now, while I was trying to cut down on my smoking, this news warranted another cigarette. The airport has a nice smoking area, looking at the runway, where a flight was taking off - except it wasn't, as it was just floating silently , in a surreal manner. Some sight for a smoke. Yet, as I was clicking my lighter, I noticed something weird. Well - something that should've not been weird, but in this specific scenario, it was rather unusual: a few airport technician looking guys, in high visibility vests, cargo pants - and despite the cloudy early morning, dark aviator sunglasses - were walking around. Y'know, actually walking - while the world around them was dead still. 

I'm back now at the restaurant, typing this down on my laptop. Now, I know that my demeanour may feel like I'm not taking the situation seriously enough, but trust me, this is my defense mechanism when I am positively shitting myself - which is pretty much the case now. I mean I'm not stupid. I saw the news of my crashed plane, and I can connect the dots. I'm wondering if this is limbo, death or some otherworldly shit‚Ä¶ But the call of nature is disrupting my spiral into anxiety. After the coffee and the ciggie, I‚Äôm not only about to shit myself figuratively, but also literally, so I will try to hunt down a bathroom in this hellscape of an airport. I'll check back in a bit to see if anyone's around, and update y‚Äôall. Cheerio.

Update 1

So I went to answer the call of nature. Luckily one out of the four  stalls was open at least. I was also not jealous of the poor bastards whom eternity found in the middle of dropping a log. So, I was doing my business when I noticed... feet. First I could see shadows under the stall door, through the gap, then two pairs of work shoes - two people, walking around in the bathroom. Now, I was about to call out, but something held me back - on top of how awkward it is to have a mid-shit conversation. Soon I realised what set my alarms off. I saw the feet - but I did not hear them. They were walking in complete silence - until they started talking. I mean I reckon they were talking, but I couldn't understand shit. Saying their words were garbled is an understatement. It sounded like a recording of an already foreign language being played backwards, while distorted via a radio. So - I clenched my buttocks and remained silent, until they left. I was not against the idea of trying to communicate with.... whatever these lads were, but the situation was not exactly ideal, so I decided to delay.

Instead of immediately heading back towards the bar near my gate where I‚Äôve left my luggage and my laptop, I wandered around a little bit, as my plane was not about to leave. Upon inspecting the motionless terminal, I found some of the guys I've seen earlier on the runway, and in the toilet. Contrasting how everything was halted around them, they stood out being busybodies, but they were always behind locked doors, on different floors, or otherwise inaccessible territories. In parts that you would normally not notice while wandering around an airport.

Forgive me for sounding like a broken record with the whole liminal spaces thing, but this was another aspect of that. When you're at a place like this - a place of transition - there are so many little nooks and crannies you just look straight through. At an airport, you move with purpose - everyone moves with purpose - , so these areas escape your attention. Now, it was the contrary, in an uncanny way. Noone moved with purpose - noone moved, period - except in these hidden places, which highlighted them, making me feel like I'm seeing things I shouldn't be seeing.

However, this was not reciprocated. See, I was not particularly hiding - yet none of the employees appeared to react to me in any way. It looked like I had two options: reenact the movie ""Terminal"" except in this ghost airport or just take my chances to get  noticed - so I chose the latter. I started waving at them through the windows of locked doors and shouting at them from floors below, yet they all remained unfazed. Pretty fucking rude, honestly. Or at least, this was the case until I got back to my spot. Then things escalated.

Returning to the bar where I left my laptop and bags, I could see three of these airport-security looking guys (?), carefully circling my luggage, discussing it in their garbled radio language. However, upon my arrival, unlike the other airport staff, this trio noticed me - and they made it painfully obvious that they did. As soon as I approached, they turned towards me in perfect unison. Now, I know that leaving your bags unattended like that is a big no-no at airports - and in a normal situation, I wouldn't have done so, but it's rather clear that this was far from what could be considered normal. I hoped that they would agree, so I apologetically explained to them that I was just heading to the pisser for a little bit. My excuse did not seem to convince them.

The two dudes on the side kept staring at me through their oversized sunglasses unmoving, while the third one began to walk towards me with seemingly malicious intent. I attempted to defuse the situation diplomatically, but seeing how he steadily moved his hand towards a black, taser looking device holstered on his belt, I concluded that my charisma will not save me today. So I resorted to the next best alternative: violence.

I know full well that my following reaction was not a rational, well adjusted one - assaulting airport staff is a fine way to get banned from flying for life after all - , but let me explain. See, in my late teenage years, I had a short stint as en employee at a shoddy nightclub. Some of my experiences there irreversibly altered my ""fight or flight"" instinct into ""punch first, ask questions later"". And believe me, I felt threatened enough to have my reflexes take over. So anyways, I swung at the bastard. Admittedly, I am not in my best shape, definitely not after last night, so I was somewhat surprised seeing him collapse like a sack of flour, as soon as my knuckles connected to his face, sending his earpiece, cap and glasses flying. I was somewhat even more surprised seeing the other two guards immediately dematerialize in the same moment. Just gone, in a blink. 

I began to suspect that these guys were not your usual, bored, underpaid caffeine-addicted airport staff but something more sinister. Soon enough, my suspicion became certainty. The less lucky one of these... entities (?) I whacked laid in front of me, face down. To see the damage I may have caused, and to check his pulse just in case, I grabbed his shoulders and turned him on his back, so he faced towards me. Now, remember I said these guys looked like normal airport employees? Well - there was a little bit of a difference. The guy had like a million eyes. 

The face, previously covered by the dark tinted lenses, which now lay shattered on the floor, stared at me with countless pupils. Small ones, big ones, just dotted all over the sockets, in a way that should not be possible. Not entirely unlike a spider, but way more crowded. In fact, there were simply too many of them: they should have not fit the space normally only occupied by two eyes, yet there they were - kind of like a Mandelbrot fractal, they appeared to be almost infinite - and frankly, fairly hypnotic. But I had to snap out of it. For the lack of anything better to do, I figured I sit down, and type this update.

I have mixed feelings about the situation. On the one hand, I'm somewhat relieved that I didn't ruin the day of some poor bastard at the airport (amd parallelly, didn't ruin my chances of me flying ever again), but in the meantime, I am a tad perplexed by what could be the consequences for KO-ing a timeless, slightly eldritch entity. On top of that, I can‚Äôt really get those eyes out of my mind - and not in a romantic way. See, (no pun intended) I honestly don't know for how long I was staring into them, but once I was out of it, I felt like‚Ä¶ I remembered something. I'm not too sure what yet, but I think I‚Äôll take another smoke break to try and figure it out. Here's hoping that my pal won't go anywhere. I'll get back to y'all soon.

Update 2

Midway through my ciggie, I realised that the unconscious guy may have a way of entering those little hidden areas I was ranting about beforehand. Since at this point I was fairly certain that the areas accessible for passengers won‚Äôt hold any answers, I figured I could borrow a keycard. (Spare me from the moral lesson of looting from a (hopefully only) unconscious entity).

Of course these security gates also require a password in addition to the keycard, but since apart from the trio messing with my luggage, no one acknowledged my existence, it was not particularly difficult to follow one of these mysterious walkers towards an off limits area, and peek at the 4 digits password over their shoulders. 

The keycode was, I shit you not, ""4444"". Airport security my ass.

I opened the security door, and entered a bland, white, blindingly lit hallway. Leaving the passenger area, with its soothing colours, kitschy decorations and fake plants, and entering a blindingly lit, barren security hallway... Surprisingly it didn't give me as much of a whiplash as I expected it would. Of course, this corridor had none of the artificially welcoming atmosphere of the travellers lounge, but it still felt like that the two areas were related (I can already hear your snarky comments saying 'yes, both are parts of the airport dumbass' - but it's not that.) It felt like the empty corridor represented the reality of this place, and outside of it, all the bits and bobs that made it feel welcoming were just there to ease people in a sense of familiarity instead of liminality. But here, behind the thick blue doors, that poorly fitting facade was dropped. No siree, no comfy feelings, colourful advertisements and 2 Euro massage chairs here for you: the corridor screamed, through the humming of the bright white neon lights, that you're a stranger, and you shouldn't be here.

Too bad I got used to people screaming at me not to do things, then doing them anyways (and corridors I guess? Kinda ruined that metaphor here).

So I marched on, peering into barren office rooms, some of them containing some oblivious airport-entities, their real self hidden behind their sunglasses. After a bit of wandering, I noticed an area labelled ""monitoring room"", and on a whim, I entered. The label didn't lie. There sure were some monitors in there. Like, a lot of monitors - way too many for it to fit a room of this size. They weirdly reminded me of the jumbled mess of eyes the entity I knocked out. And, as this thought entered my mind and I remembered staring into those eyes, the smorgasbord of screens suddenly started to make sense, and I began to see security camera footage steadily shifting through all of them.

At first glance, they appeared to be normal security feeds, but upon closer inspection, I noticed some increasingly unusual things at each one I looked at. The first anomaly I noticed was an image depicting the frozen scenery at the departure gates, including the big board listing all the flights, flight numbers and destinations. Except apparently the 1300 Aeroflot flight was scheduled to leave to.... Pulkovo Airport, Leningrad.

On another screen, the corridor with unmoving people had big billboards behind them - one of them proudly displaying a vaguely familiar, elderly guy, who, despite looking 80+, still had a fabulous pompadour haircut - and next to it, with big bold letters: THE KING 90 - Elvis Live, at Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Vienna - 08 January.

On another, every sign and advertisement was written in german. I am in Austria, but still, the complete lack of English was unusual in an international airport. In addition, airport security was wearing uncomfortably sharp uniforms with red armbands. As I looked closer in a corner of the screen, I had to do a double take, as a sizable portrait of a certain moustached failed artist, and piece of shit was there on full display.

Each screen I looked at showed this airport, but subtly - or less subtly - altered. I was witnessing different realities from a nondescript nerve centre. After a certain point, I found the security footage of the little bar I left my stuff at earlier. And I noticed something pretty upsetting (and bear in mind, after  seeing a long dead dictator's painting on a wall, the bar to upset me was placed pretty fucking high).

See, you remember that TV I've seen the news report of the plane crash of my flight. I could kind of make out through the security screens that it was still broadcasting about the accident. The issue is - the broadcast was the same in all the alternative realities, no matter how many screens I was looking at. Apparently there are some worlds where Elvis survives or where the USSR still stands, but it appears that my fucking plane overshoots the runaway and blows up in each one. Bit of a bummer, really.

I snapped out of staring at the screen thanks to the beep of a walkie-talkie laid down on the table next to the screens. The sound was followed by a conversation of the airport staff, in their unusual incomprehensible language... until it stopped being incomprehensible. As I started to focus on it, just like on the creature's eyes, and later on the screens, I simply realised that I understood what they were saying.  I'll try my best to translate.

‚Äú....execution error for cornerstone event #4778, due to passenger/victim manifest incomplete. Please advise, handler A out.‚Äù

‚Äú...Handler A, we may have an update on your situation. Analytics dept. confirmed the identity of the interloper. Missing cornerstone event manifest parameters are at value match with interloper...Handler B out""

You know those moments when two people are shit-talking a third one, not knowing that said third person is within clear earshot of them? The whole stitch began to feel like that. I mean I'm pretty sure that you figured out who they refer to as interloper the same time as I did: yours truly. Now, as the subject of the conversation, I felt that I was warranted to contribute. So I pressed the button on the radio, and, to the best of my ability, I tried to speak in their language (and mimic their ""expert"" talking style).

‚Äú...Handler A, Handler B, this is interloper reporting. Please advise on how to assist in resolving issue with cornerstone event parameters. Interloper out""

A bit of inconvenient silence followed. I had a feeling that someone was about to be fired.

‚Äú...Roger that, interloper. Please standby until HQ is instructed.‚Äù

More silence

‚ÄúThis is Handler A to HQ. Initiate cornerstone event rollback‚Äù

‚ÄúActive handler group, this is HQ. Please confirm rollback request‚Äù

I was wondering if they were aware that I can hear all this shit.

‚ÄúHandler A, confirming‚Äù

‚ÄúHandler B, Confirming‚Äù

‚ÄúActive handler group, this is HQ. Airfrance flight xxxx (of course - my goddamn flight) returned to cornerstone event launch position. Awaiting parameter correction.‚Äù

Finally, they got back to me

‚ÄúInterloper, this is Handler B, do you copy? Interloper, come in.‚Äú

‚ÄúLoud and clear, handler B‚Äù I responded, fighting back the urge to wish him good luck in his future job hunt.

‚ÄúInterloper, please return to the initial spatial coordinates of departure from your host timeline. Once your spatial coordinates are approved, your temporal coordinates will be reset. Please continue routine to ensure cornerstone event success.‚Äù

Right, great. So I go back to the security gate where this whole mess started, my good friend Handler B resets time, I board my flight, then crash and die, and ensure that the ""cornerstone"" event is done in my timeline. Wouldn‚Äôt that be a right, heroic sacrifice.

‚Äú...Roger that interloper, will comply‚Äù

 I said. ‚ÄúHell fucking no"", I thought. 

I'm typing this note just in front of that ominous security gate that froze time the moment I passed it. If I understand the handler correctly, the moment I pass it again, time will restart. 

One way to find out - see you on the other side.

Final update: 

Okay, so it worked. I'm typing away from the same bar I was sitting at, except now everything is in motion again. All is well now. Well, almost all. As soon as I passed through the gate and everything suddenly reanimated, I began to feel a bit nauseous. Was it the fact that after hours spent in a frozen, soundless and timeless world, suddenly the hustle and bustle of reality returned? Or was it because I was still hungover as hell, and it didn‚Äôt occur to me that I could‚Äôve nicked a paracetamol while time stood still? Dunno. But I needed to shake it off and get the closest thing I could to a cold shower - a thorough face wash. Except, as I was drying my mug, staring at myself in the bathroom mirror, the eyes of my mirror image started to blur, and proliferate. Who knows, maybe soon I will have to invest in some large dark aviators... I can also catch some unusual changes in the corner of my eyes. Is that a poster of Elvis over here? That sign that was in english just a moment ago, is it now written in cyrillic? But apart from these minor inconveniences, most things seem to be okay.

So - am I about to board a crashing plane? Nah, as you may have figured that I am not great in following instructions. As soon as I was back, I set my VPN up and, sent a couple of anonymous emails - to airport security, to the police, to Air France - letting them know that something is off with that flight. I see that it is delayed now, and they are replacing the craft, citing ""technical issues"". If I'm actually losing it, and imagined the whole thing, I probably ruined the day of my fellow travellers. But if not, then I just helped those poor bastards to live to see another day. But about the implications of me doing that, well...

So, all sunshine and rainbows right, I oughta pat myself on the back. I fucked around with beings beyond time, and prevented a major accident. Yea, normally I would, but there are some subtle things going on that overshadow my urge to celebrate. See, the eerie sunglasses-wearing part of the crew is still around, and they definitely look a bit more agitated than before. And while I couldn't really catch all their conversations, here and there I hear some jumbled radio fragments I still understand.

They mention a certain ""cornerstone correction protocol"" and ""enhanced intensity events"" in ""close proximity"". Now, what does that mean in practice? Hell if I know. But, and I know I am being pretty vague here, it sounds like shit is about to go down. Well, either way - they‚Äôre calling my flight. Suppose it is ‚Ä¶.time‚Ä¶. for me to leave this godforsaken airport.",3,1730032481.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1gd9xdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SSAChristian/comments/1gd9xdm/why_our_deep_fatherson_wound_is_an_unfathomable/,Why Our Deep Father-Son Wound Is an Unfathomable Blessing,"Hey everyone, I've noticed there's a lot of asking for help and sharing of setbacks, relapses, and pain. I thought it might be useful to share a few ways I try to cope with the struggles many of you are so familiar with. I'm doing this as an experiment, so let me know if it's helpful or not. Don't hesitate to give me your feedback. These are all my personal stories and may not resonate with everyone. I wish I had a magic wand, but, like all of us, I don't. I hope this benefits at least some of us. And a big request: whenever you can, please share your victories and the ways you cope. Remember, for many people, this may be the only place of hope. Let's make it an even better spot of strength!



I complained to my spiritual director about how orphaned I feel with a living father. I told him that I have never truly had a father. My memories of my earthly father are mixed. As a sick child, I remember him often taking me into his arms and walking around the room during my flare-ups, which happened quite often. This is my most gentle memory of him. The rest are rather harsh: he used to use the belt, and the worst part is that I never understood why. He never bothered to explain. Every time I felt weak, he seized the opportunity to humiliate me and reinforce my weakness. I can't recall a single moment of support from him. Even now, in every conversation, he manages to stress what a loser I am, how wrong I am, how there is always someone better than me, and how I failed his high expectations. You can imagine that I developed an early strategy to avoid him and, eventually, any men.



In high school, when meeting my peers, my automatic inner thought was that they were much better than me and had the right to humiliate, ignore, or hit me. I was both attracted to and afraid of them. I tried different therapeutic strategies and told my spiritual director that I do feel better, but the feeling of being an orphan is still with me. I don't know how to deal with it. He laughed, which made me feel even more embarrassed.



""Listen,"" he said, ""you do not realize what a blessing you have! There are two aspects to it. Yes, your father was not the best, and it sucks. But guess what? Never in my life have I met anyone without a father-son wound, even those with the most caring, gentle fathers. Even if we asked every single person on earth, we would still find that fatherly pain. Do you know why? Jesus tells us in Matthew 23:9: 'And call no man your father upon the earth.' He tells us this in such a harsh, shocking form precisely because we're looking for the medicine in the wrong place, and He wants to heal this wound within us.: 'for one is your Father, which is in heaven.' Our deep longing for a father can never be satisfied even with the best fathers on earth. Your father-son wound is deeper than just your childhood trauma; it is a call to be intimate with God.""



""We are emotionally connected to those who gave us life, but we often forget that there were three persons involved in our conception: our earthly parents and God Himself. The father-son wound is a longing for connection with God. If you read the Bible, you'll be taken aback by how often God calls us back to Him. The moment we stray, He calls us back. When Adam sinned in the Garden of Eden, what was the first thing God did? Genesis 3:8-9: ""And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?""



""When we do not respond to God's calling, when we stray from Him, there is a strong longing in our hearts which we call the father-son wound. It is a wound because we are separated from our Father, we hear His voice but still hesitate to answer and return. Check the prophets: Isaiah 65:12: ""I called, but you did not answer; I spoke, but you did not listen."" Jeremiah 7:13: ""I spoke to you again and again, but you did not listen; I called you, but you did not answer."" Hosea 11:2: ""The more I called them, the more they went away from me.""



""The good thing though is that this wound is like a compass; the further you stray from God, the more it will bleed. As St. Augustine said: ""You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in You."" Believe me, that fact that you are so sensitive to this pain is a great blessing because many people suppress this longing and thus lose the ability to find an intimate relationship with God the Father.""



This new perspective allowed me to view my story from a different angle. I was blessed to have two father-figure substitutes: a friend from my parish, who is my father's age, and our pastor. Both showed me what God would do. The pastor always prioritized those in need of special attention: he bought a minivan to bring children to Mass, prayed and fasted for me and a few other parishioners facing big challenges, and organized individual prayers and catered support. My father-aged parishioner always cared about my situation, often inviting me for coffee or to spend an evening with his family. He was a wise man who gave me a lot of valuable advice. From time to time, we also prayed together.



Yet, somewhere deep inside, I realized it was not enough to fulfill my deep longing. It will never suffice unless I turn this longing toward the source of all fulfillment, my Father in heaven.



That's my story for today. Thanks for sticking with me until the end. Let's make this space solution-driven. If you feel comfortable, please share your successes and the tools you use to cope with pain and challenges. I would love to learn from you. Think about those who will read; your words might become a true source of inspiration and healing. Not everyone has access to support groups or therapy, and for some, this may be their only place of hope. Let's turn it into an even better haven of strength!",2,1730032398.0,SSAChristian,1,1.0,False

He's only one year old, we got him from a family we know who's Grandma couldn't handle him (she was getting rid of all her pets). We got a big bag of feed, cobs and some jellies from the previous owner who said he enjoyed them, though we're not sure the best feeding methods for any of the treats.

We're looking into getting some more involved toys, he seems to enjoy trying to escape his cage and that requires a lot of movement. We've got the whole living room set out with a small set of perches on the coffee table and a hanging playground area near the window, opposite side to his cage. So he's got plenty of room to fly around and we're intending to keep him out most the time, the room is in the middle of the house so he might have to spend some time inside if we're moving lots of stuff. He spends the nights in the cage.

We've also got two budgies who he seems to like interacting with, but we haven't let them out with him because they seem to be scared of him (Our budgies are unfortunately rather skittish, but they're getting better as time goes on). The budgies have a fairly big cage and it's full of colourful toys so I think he was attracted to the colours as much as the budgies. We're going to put the budgies' blanket on top of their cage (but not on the sides) to keep them calm if they don't relax around him.

I was wondering if anyone had any tips or ideas to aid us to bond with him, or knew of any good toys/snacks. Even if he doesn't bond with anyone, I just want him to live a happy life.",3,1730032016.0,QuakerParrot,2,1.0,False

Does anyone have thoughts on time period or any other knowledge of these items? 

Here are some items of note: 

- 7 fully intact vintage glass jars. One is a Barbasol shave cream jar made in the late 1930s to early 1940s. Another appears to have the original cork stuck inside. 
- Several pieces of pottery, including a coffee mug with just a few chips and half a plate broken in 2 pieces. 
- Several bottle necks and bottle bottoms. One green glass bottom is marked Clicquot Club, which apparently is a company that ceased to exist in 1965. None of the other bottle trademarks I've found online are quite like this one. So I'm not sure how old it is yet. 
- A Hubbell bakelite porcelain thing. I'm thinking an outlet piece...?
- A spark plug.
- A couple of things that I think are ammo 
- And some yet-to-be-identified things.

I recently bought Hibrew h10a with hibrew G5 grinder, I'm having trouble dialing in the espresso I'll elaborate below.

1. First attempt was made with beans that we're light roast and quite old so all I got was extremely sour shots that ran in 15 secs, I figured that my beans are stale (roasted 4 months ago) so I gave up on them.
2. Second attempt was with the beans that were roasted around first week of September and similar thing happened (btw it says filter roast on the pack) and enough pressure was not generated,  it showed that the pressure was around 8-9 bars on the machine.
Further just for the sake of experiment I tried grinding finer ( I was grinding the finest espresso setting up until that point on the g5 grinder, this time I went into Turkish coffee range) 
RESULT: more pressure was generated this time, the shot ran 5 sec slower ( 20 sec now) and obviously espresso was bad.
 
Now comes the question 
1. Is this a stale beans problem?
2. Or grind size issue?
3. If it's a grind size issue, is anyone familiar with the Hibrew G5 grinder and can I calibrate it to grind finer? Because I was pretty much at end range for the 20 sec shot which generated high pressure.

Lindsay made her way downstairs.¬† She said, ‚ÄúDad, good luck with that.¬† You know how Valerie can be in the bathroom.¬† She‚Äôs so sluggish in the mornings.‚Äù

Caitlyn soon showed up.¬† Jim asked her, ‚ÄúCaitlyn, how did you sleep during that bad storm last night?‚Äù

‚ÄúDad, I slept like a baby.¬† That storm didn‚Äôt scare me one bit.‚Äù

Jim smiled and said, ‚ÄúOkay, you girls head to the kitchen.¬† Sydney‚Äôs starting breakfast.‚Äù

Jim started to make his way upstairs.¬† He made it about halfway up the stairs when he saw Lauren and Valerie start their way downstairs.¬† Lauren was wearing a dress.¬† But Valerie, being Valerie, was wearing her usual thing.¬† A sweatshirt (with what appeared to be a T-shirt underneath), scuffed up tennis shoes and a pair of jeans with holes in the knees.¬† Jim would say something about that.¬† But this time, he didn‚Äôt.¬† But he did say, ‚ÄúI hope you girls are in the mood for a decent breakfast this morning, because that is what Sydney‚Äôs fixing.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt sure smells good,‚Äù Lauren said.

Jim said, ‚ÄúIt does.¬† You girls be sure and tell Sydney that.‚Äù

Four of the girls did say that to Sydney.¬† Valerie didn‚Äôt.¬† She did try to get a bowl out of the cabinet.¬† Valerie attempted to make her a bowl of Fruity Pebbles.¬† But Jim stopped her.¬† He said to her, ‚ÄúFreeze it right there, Valerie.‚Äù

Valerie gave Jim a rather murderous look.¬† He said, ‚ÄúValerie, it just so happens Sydney is fixing eggs, bacon, toast and grits for breakfast.¬† You can eat that just like your sisters.‚Äù

‚ÄúDad, do I have to?‚Äù Valerie asked Jim.

‚ÄúYes, Valerie.¬† You do.‚Äù

Jim took the box of Fruity Pebbles from Valerie.¬† She finally agreed to have a decent breakfast with the others.¬† Chelsea did agree to eat eggs and bacon, but instead of toast, she opted for a bagel with garden vegetable cream cheese.¬† They all spent about fifteen minutes eating their breakfast.¬† There were no complaints, even from Valerie.¬†

After they got done, Jim got all the girls (except Chelsea) to finish getting ready for school.¬† Ashley and Toni showed up.¬† They both offered to take Jim‚Äôs girls to school.¬† Ashley was going to drive her son, Dakota, to school.¬† Dakota was now attending Radcliffe Middle School with Lindsay.¬† Ashley said she would be happy to drive Lindsay to school this morning.¬† Toni was on her way to her new job at a medical office near Carolinas Medical Center, where she was now working as an assistant for a pediatrician.¬† She started that job on Monday of that week.¬† Toni said, ‚ÄúJim, I go right by Dilworth Elementary, so I will be glad to drive Valerie and Caitlyn to school if it‚Äôs okay with you.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúSure, Toni.¬† That‚Äôll be great.‚Äù

Ashley and Toni saw Sydney in the kitchen, washing the dishes.¬† They said hello to her.¬† Then Jim asked her, ‚ÄúSydney, why don‚Äôt you put those dishes in the dishwasher?‚Äù

Sydney answered, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind, Jim.¬† Really.¬† Besides, they‚Äôre not that many.¬† After I get done, I‚Äôll be getting ready for work.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúOkay, Sydney.¬† Svetlana will be here any minute.¬† Just put the dishes in the drain board, and Svetlana will put them away.‚Äù

Sydney said she would.¬† Lauren was almost ready to leave for school.¬† Jim asked her how she was getting to school.¬† She said, ‚ÄúDonnie Courtland agreed to drive me and Christie to school.¬† He should be here any minute.‚Äù

Jim said to Lauren, ‚ÄúIt sure is nice you have some friends who can drive you to school, especially where you are now, with you in your final year of high school.‚Äù

Lauren said, ‚ÄúYes, Dad.¬† You know it‚Äôs nice to have friends, period.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Lauren.¬† That is true as well.‚Äù

Jim, Sydney, Ashley and Toni all smiled when Lauren said that.¬† They had to remember one special moment.¬† That moment in the summer of 1984.¬† That moment at that house in Lansing, North Carolina, in the mountains in the far northwestern corner of the state.¬† That was when Jim and his friends made that special promise, the one to stay friends, no matter what.¬† So far, they never broke it, even though two of those friends were no longer with them.¬† Candi Faulkner and Todd McClendon.¬† Toni and Jeremy were not with them at the time because it was a church youth ensemble trip and they had just been born, but they would make that promise with those friends in later years.¬† Over the years as more friends arrived, they were included in that special promise.¬† Years later, the kids of those friends made a similar promise.¬† Just like Jim and his friends, the kids have not broken that promise, either.¬†

Lauren got a look out the window.¬† She saw Donnie Courtland pull into the driveway in his car, a red 1973 Chevy station wagon with wood grain trim.¬† Christie, his sister, was riding shotgun.¬† Lauren grabbed her book bag, and she said, ‚ÄúDad, I must go.¬† Donnie and Christie are here.‚Äù

Jim walked with Lauren to the front porch.¬† He gave Donnie and Christie a wave.¬† They waved back.¬† Ashley and Toni rushed past Jim, with his three youngest girls with them.¬† After they said their good-byes to Jim, they were all off to school.¬† Donnie‚Äôs station wagon was the last car to leave the Faulkner house.¬† After Donnie left, Svetlana showed up in her little Oldsmobile.¬† She parked in her usual spot, at the curb in front of the house.¬†

Sydney had finished putting away the dishes when Jim and Svetlana stepped into the kitchen.¬† Sydney said, ‚ÄúHi, Svetlana.¬† Jim, I am about to finish getting ready for work.‚Äù

Jim had gone up the stairs when he said to Svetlana, ‚ÄúOkay, Svetlana.¬† There is a good possibility that I‚Äôll be late coming this evening, along with Chelsea.¬† But my other girls should be home on time this afternoon.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure thing, Jim.¬† What‚Äôs going on with you and Chelsea?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is a possibility I may be buying a car from Dad today.¬† Chelsea may also be buying a car from Dad as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúJim, that‚Äôll be great.¬† What car will you be getting?‚Äù¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúIf I can get it, it‚Äôll be a silver 2004 Cadillac Escalade.‚Äù

Jim showed Svetlana a picture of it on his cell phone.¬† Svetlana said, ‚ÄúJim, that is one nice car.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, Svetlana.¬† Dad said he can get me a good deal on it if I‚Äôm interested.‚Äù

Then Svetlana asked Jim, ‚ÄúWhat kind of car will Chelsea be getting?‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúThere are two cars she has her eye on.¬† One is a Chrysler convertible, and the other is a Camaro with T-tops.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich one will she get?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe hasn‚Äôt decided.¬† But I hope she gets something she wants, and something she‚Äôll be happy with.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo do I, Jim.¬† I wouldn‚Äôt mind getting another car, but right now, I‚Äôm stuck with what I‚Äôve got.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo see Dad at Faulkner Motors.¬† He can help you get a good deal on a car.‚Äù

Jim knew that Svetlana‚Äôs Oldsmobile had been giving her problems.¬† He knew that, sooner or later, she would have to get another car.¬† In addition to her job as Jim‚Äôs housekeeper, Svetlana also worked Saturdays at the Sunbeam Bread Store, and twice a week at the nearby Home Depot.¬† Between her housekeeping job and her job at the bread store, Svetlana did not make a whole lot of money.¬† So, Svetlana would have to get a used car.¬† There was Faulkner Motors on South Mint Street.¬† If Svetlana made the decision to buy a used car there, there would be a good selection.

Svetlana said she would go to Faulkner Motors if she needed to.¬† Jim grabbed his travel mug, filled it up with coffee (black with sugar, as he usually made his coffee), and he left for work.

¬†

üòä

¬†

Jim had yet another good day at Queen City Chevrolet.¬† He managed to sell three automobiles before he left work at four o‚Äô clock.¬† Before he left work, he called Chelsea on her cell phone.¬† Jim said, ‚ÄúChelsea, I am about to leave work and I am headed in your direction.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Dad.¬† I‚Äôll be here when you show up.‚Äù

Jim left the dealership, and he drove to the Walgreen‚Äôs on South Boulevard where Chelsea was working.¬† Jim walked into the store.¬† He saw the manager.¬† The manager told Jim that Chelsea was in the back and would be out shortly.¬† Meanwhile, Jim walked around the store.¬† He picked up a small bag of potato chips, two small bottles of Snapple Tea (one for himself and the other for Chelsea), a case of Cokes, a car magazine and a roll of Certs.¬† At the checkout counter, there was a rack of toy cars.¬† Jim got a look at them.¬† There were so many, he had trouble deciding on which one he wanted to buy.¬† He finally decided on one, a red 1971 Camaro.¬† Jim thought he would put that one on his desk at Queen City Chevrolet.¬† After he paid for his purchases, he saw Chelsea walking toward him.¬† Jim asked Chelsea, ‚ÄúAre you ready to go to Faulkner Motors?‚Äù

Chelsea answered, ‚ÄúYes, Dad.¬† About as ready as I can be.‚Äù

Jim and Chelsea got in his Impala.¬† Jim handed Chelsea her bottle of Snapple Tea.¬† He drove to Faulkner Motors on South Mint Street.¬† He drove past Queen City Chevrolet.¬† He saw Mark and Jonathan with people looking at cars.¬† Jim seemed quite pleased with that.¬† Jim wanted to wave at them, but he doubted they would see him.

Jim arrived at Faulkner Motors.¬† Right away, he saw Walter‚Äôs light blue 1967 Mustang and Renee‚Äôs dark blue late-model Mustang.¬† Both cars were parked on one side of the office.¬† There was a silver 2004 Cadillac Escalade parked on the other side.¬† Jim figured that would probably be the one.¬† He was anxious to check it out.¬†

Jim parked in front of the office.¬† Walter and Renee quickly stepped out of the office.¬† They gave him a hug.¬† After Chelsea got out of Jim‚Äôs Impala, Walter and Renee gave her a hug.¬† Walter said, ‚ÄúJim, I‚Äôm happy you and Chelsea are here.¬† There‚Äôs something I wish to show you.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Dad.¬† Let‚Äôs see the car.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Jim.¬† But first, I want to show you two what I am planning on doing to Faulkner Motors.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Dad.¬† Let‚Äôs see what you have in mind.‚Äù

Walter took Jim and Chelsea around the lot.¬† He said, ‚ÄúFor starters, look at this parking lot.¬† It‚Äôs nothing but dirt and gravel.¬† And after it rains, it can get downright muddy.¬† That‚Äôs not good for the cars.¬† I do like them clean because clean ones can sell better.‚Äù

Jim looked around in every direction.¬† He said, ‚ÄúYes, Dad.¬† I do agree.¬† That makes me glad the parking lot at Queen City Chevrolet is paved.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† And that brings me to another thing.¬† I‚Äôm planning on having this lot paved.¬† That‚Äôll make it better for Faulkner Motors.‚Äù

‚ÄúDad, I would agree.¬† Having a paved lot just may keep your vehicles cleaner.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† That‚Äôs why I want the parking lot paved.¬† I talked to Kate, Renee, Jerry and Paulina.¬† They all agree with me.‚Äù

Jim continued to look around.¬† He got a look at the Charlotte skyline.¬† At the same time, he saw Renee showing Chelsea a dark gray Camaro with T-tops.¬† Chelsea told Jim that the Camaro she was looking at was a 1993 model.¬† But then, Jim realized something.¬† The car Renee was showing Chelsea was not a 1993 model.¬† It looked a lot newer.¬† Jim figured the model of the Camaro to be around 2001.¬†

Meanwhile, Jim and Walter continued their conversation.¬† Jim asked Walter, ‚ÄúWhen do you plan on having the lot paved?‚Äù

Walter answered, ‚ÄúI got some men coming next week to look at the lot.¬† If all goes well, I might be able to get it done around February or March.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúOkay, Dad.¬† I hope it all goes well.‚Äù

Then Walter said, ‚ÄúJim, come in the office.¬† There‚Äôs something else I‚Äôm planning on doing that I‚Äôd like to show you.‚Äù

Walter took Jim into the office.¬† Walter showed Jim what appeared to be blueprints.¬† Walter spread the blueprints across the desk.¬† He said, ‚ÄúJim, I want you to be one of the first to see this.¬† I am planning on rebuilding the office building.¬† I‚Äôll also be adding a wheelchair ramp.¬† I‚Äôd like to make it more spacious, more comfortable for me, Renee, Paulina and the customers.‚Äù¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

Jim looked at the blueprints.¬† He said, ‚ÄúOkay, Dad.¬† This was the office building and storage building Pam Gilmore used when she ran the place.¬† I remember that storage building quite well.¬† When I started out here washing cars, Paulina and I would take out red wagons filled with cleaning stuff.¬† I remember it all quite well.‚Äù

Walter said, ‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† I remember those wagons.¬† Renee, Paulina and I used them, too.¬† They still do.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to see those wagons are still holding out after all those years.‚Äù

Then Walter said, ‚ÄúJim, I did speak to Pam Gilmore a couple days ago.¬† She said she would go along with these plans.¬† Pam agreed the office building needed a lot of repairs.¬† She also said she was planning on paving the parking lot before she sold the used car lot‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúSure, Dad.¬† I‚Äôd be willing to go along with your plans as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe building will come first.¬† Some contractors were here a few days ago.¬† First, this office building will come down.¬† Your uncles will be here on Monday with a camper trailer.¬† That will serve as our office until the new one is built.¬† If all goes well, it could be completed in a few months.‚Äù

‚ÄúDad, that sounds good.¬† I cannot wait to see it when it‚Äôs all done.‚Äù

Then Walter showed Jim something else.¬† It was an artist‚Äôs drawing of what the office building would look like when completed.¬† Walter said, ‚ÄúOf course, I‚Äôll put a couple drink machines in the front.¬† I‚Äôll make the steps, porch and wheelchair ramp out of concrete.¬† That‚Äôll make it stronger.¬† And I‚Äôm also thinking about putting some new lights in the front, and I‚Äôd like to put in another pole or two with security lights.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds good.¬† More of those lights will be good for the car lot.‚Äù

Then Walter showed Jim another drawing.¬† He said, ‚ÄúThis is what I‚Äôm hoping the inside will look like.¬† I‚Äôd like to put in another office or two.¬† I‚Äôll still have this desk.¬† I am also thinking about adding a computer desk.¬† And look at that table with the stereo on it.¬† I‚Äôm also considering getting a new large flat-screen TV and having it mounted on the wall.¬† And on another wall, I‚Äôll have a new larger pegboard to hold all the keys for all the cars.¬† And I also plan to have framed ads of cars on the walls.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúOkay, Dad.¬† I have a question.¬† What about the storage building?¬† Do you have any plans for that?‚Äù

Walter said, ‚ÄúYes, Jim.¬† The storage building will stay where it‚Äôs at.¬† But I plan to fix it up some.¬† And I may get a ‚Äòwet-dry‚Äô vacuum cleaner.‚Äù

‚ÄúDad, that‚Äôll be good.¬† Paulina and I tried to get Pam to get one.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, Jim.¬† I know.¬† Paulina told me that once.‚Äù

‚ÄúDad, it looks like you know what you want.¬† I think you got some good ideas for Faulkner Motors.‚Äù

Then, Walter took Jim outside.¬† He said, ‚ÄúJim, there‚Äôs one more thing I wish to show you.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Dad.¬† What is it?‚Äù

Walter pointed to a building next door and said, ‚ÄúJim, I will be buying that old gas station next door.¬† I am going to hire an auto mechanic, and he can work on cars, and help me and Renee and Paulina out as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds great, Dad.¬† Have you got anyone in mind?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe.¬† I‚Äôm thinking of Scout Gilmore.¬† I understand the lease on his gas station is up soon and it may not be renewed.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhoa, Dad.¬† That‚Äôs the first I heard of that.‚Äù

Jim knew that when Luke Holbrook died of cancer in 2004, he left the gas station to Scout because Luke felt he was the best man for it.¬† The gas station had been on East Morehead Street near Bethany Street since about the early fifties.¬† Nothing was ever said about a lease.¬† That blew Jim‚Äôs mind. ¬†¬†¬†

Walter said, ‚ÄúSo far, the only four people who know about this are you, me, Renee and Paulina.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, Dad.¬† I wish to find out more about this.¬† But for now, I‚Äôll just keep this between us.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, Jim.¬† I just hope we can get this thing off the ground soon.‚Äù

Then Walter pointed to the car, and he said, ‚ÄúJim, there‚Äôs the car I want you to check out.¬† That silver Cadillac Escalade.¬† It‚Äôs a 2004 model.¬† We just got that car in.¬† Try it out.¬† If you don‚Äôt like it or it doesn't fit your needs, maybe you can try and find something better.‚Äù

Jim walked around the Cadillac Escalade while Walter went into the office to get the key and a dealer tag.¬† As soon as Walter returned, he put the dealer tag on the vehicle.¬† He handed Jim the key, and he said, ‚ÄúJim, I got to go back in the office and make an important phone call.¬† Why don‚Äôt you take it out for a test drive?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Dad.¬† Sure.‚Äù

Jim looked in the direction where Chelsea and Renee were standing.¬† Renee was showing Chelsea a dark gray Camaro.¬† Jim shouted for Chelsea, and he told her to come to where he was standing.¬† Chelsea ran to Jim.¬† He said to her, ‚ÄúChelsea, I‚Äôd like you to join me on a test drive.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Dad.¬† Is that the car?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Chelsea.¬† It is.‚Äù

Renee walked to where Jim and Chelsea were at.¬† She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to come along with you two, if that‚Äôs okay.‚Äù

Jim got a look inside the car.¬† As soon as he saw the inside, he was amazed by how spacious it was.¬† *Maybe this car will be good for our family*, Jim thought.¬† Renee said, ‚ÄúBelieve it or not, this thing is very easy on gas.¬† The last owner took super good care of it.¬† Why don‚Äôt we try it out?‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúSure.¬† Maybe this is the car I need.‚Äù¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†¬†

Renee said, ‚ÄúOkay, then.¬† Just let me tell Dad.‚Äù

Renee quickly went to the office to let Walter know that she would be joining Jim and Chelsea for the test drive.¬† She returned to the car just as quickly.

Jim drove the car out of the lot.¬† Renee sat in the back seat, and Chelsea rode shotgun.¬† Jim got Chelsea to try out the radio and the heating and air conditioning.¬† Renee had an idea.¬† ‚ÄúJim, let‚Äôs go down South Mint Street, and then turn right on West Boulevard.‚Äù

Jim agreed with that.¬† He slowly passed Sydney‚Äôs Creations.¬† Chelsea saw Sydney‚Äôs red Camaro.¬† Chelsea rolled down the window, and she waved at Sydney.¬† Jim pulled into the parking lot.¬† He rolled down his window.¬† He told Sydney to go back in the parking lot so that she could see the Cadillac Escalade.¬† As soon as Sydney parked her Camaro, she walked to the Cadillac.¬† Renee got out, and she gave Sydney a hug.

Sydney looked at the Cadillac Escalade.¬† Renee said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a 2004 model and we got it just a couple days ago.‚Äù

Renee asked Sydney to get in and join them for the test drive.¬† Chelsea agreed to sit in the back seat with Renee, and Sydney would now ride shotgun.¬† Using her key fob, Sydney locked her Camaro, and Jim was back on the test drive.

Jim drove down South Mint Street to West Boulevard, where he made a right turn.¬† Just as Chelsea did when the test drive started, Sydney worked the controls on the radio, heater and air conditioner.¬† Sydney looked around the car, and she said, ‚ÄúJim, this car is nice.¬† Is this going to be right for the family?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Sydney.¬† I feel it will be right for us.‚Äù

‚ÄúJim, there‚Äôs you and me and the five girls.¬† And what if we decide to have another baby or two?‚Äù

Jim thought about that.¬† He knew Chelsea would soon have her own car.¬† Lauren was already driving but did not have her own car.¬† That left Lindsay, Valerie and Caitlyn.¬† Jim had not yet asked Sydney to marry him.¬† But he soon would.¬† Jim knew that, sooner or later, that question would come up.¬† But for now, Sydney wouldn‚Äôt ask that question.¬† Another question nagged in the back of Jim‚Äôs mind.¬† *Could Sydney be right about wanting another baby, or maybe two?* ¬†

Jim didn‚Äôt answer that question, at least for now.¬† He just continued driving the car.¬† Renee saw the look on Jim‚Äôs face, prompting her to ask him, ‚ÄúJim, is there a possibility you could want this Cadillac Escalade?‚Äù

Jim took a deep breath, let it out slowly, and he said, ‚ÄúYes, Renee.¬† Maybe Sydney‚Äôs right.‚Äù

Jim drove back to Faulkner Motors.¬† As he pulled into the lot, he made what would be his final decision on the car.¬† ‚ÄúYes, Renee.¬† I believe I will go with the Cadillac Escalade.‚Äù

Renee said, ‚ÄúJim, you sound like you‚Äôre very sure about your decision.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúYes, Dad.¬† I am.¬† Sydney thinks it could be better for my family.‚Äù

Sydney said, ‚ÄúJim, *our* family.‚Äù

Then Jim said, ‚ÄúAnd as for having another baby or two, we could think about that some.¬† But that will be further down the road.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, Jim.¬† I think you and Sydney both made a good choice,‚Äù Renee said.

They all went back into the office.¬† After Jim filled out some paperwork and gave Walter a down payment, he was driving back to Bethany Street in a silver 2004 Cadillac Escalade.¬†

It was a large down payment.¬† From the insurance check from the minivan, Jim left out enough to get Sydney‚Äôs engagement ring.¬† What was left was for the down payment, insurance and a new license plate.¬† Jim felt it was all worth it.¬† In a matter of days, Jim would ask Sydney to marry him.

Jim dropped Sydney off at her office so that she could get her Camaro.¬† On the way home, Chelsea told Jim she had a car picked out.¬† It was a different car from the two she was looking at.¬† Chelsea said, ‚ÄúDad, I‚Äôm thinking about getting that dark gray 2001 Camaro.‚Äù

Jim asked Chelsea, ‚ÄúWhat happened to the two cars you were looking at, the 1993 Camaro and the 1999 Chrysler?‚Äù

Chelsea said, ‚ÄúThe 1993 Camaro had some holes in the seats that looked like they came from cigarettes, and it smelled like mold inside.¬† The Chrysler‚Äôs engine compartment looked very small.¬† Aunt Renee told me the battery was inside one of the wheel wells.¬† She also told me changing the battery would prove very difficult.‚Äù

Jim added, ‚ÄúAnd Scout told me once he tried to change the oil in a Chrysler Sebring.¬† He had to take off the manifold just to change the oil and the spark plugs.‚Äù

Chelsea said, ‚ÄúAunt Renee suggested the 2001 Camaro to me.¬† After all she said about the car, I feel it would be a good choice.‚Äù

‚ÄúChelsea, if you want to go back and look at it some more, please let me know and I‚Äôll be glad to take you back to Faulkner Motors.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Dad.¬† I‚Äôd like to go back sometime this weekend if that‚Äôs okay with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Chelsea.¬† We can do that.‚Äù

¬†

üòä

¬†

Jim parked in his driveway.¬† Sydney was behind him.¬† Jim left the Escalade in the driveway while Sydney parked her Camaro in the garage next to Jim‚Äôs Impala.¬† It wasn‚Äôt long before nearly everyone on Bethany Street ran to the Faulkner house.¬† Mark and his family arrived first, followed by the Holbrook bunch.¬† Kendra was pushing a stroller carrying baby Ambrosia, with Mark and Kendra‚Äôs three daughters behind them.¬† Autumn and her family showed up next, along with Tim and Cara.¬† April Lynn was on her cell phone with someone.¬† No one knew who April Lynn was speaking to.¬† Then came Jake and Rebecca and their two daughters.¬† Sure enough, everyone showed up to check out Jim‚Äôs new SUV.¬† It seemed as though Jim Faulkner was about the most important person on Bethany Street on this cool October afternoon.¬† Svetlana had not left yet.¬† She was one of the first to see the Cadillac Escalade.¬† She said, ‚ÄúJim, dear.¬† It looks like you made one good choice.‚Äù

Jim said, ‚ÄúThanks, Svetlana.¬† I like it.¬† It has a lot of room.‚Äù

Audrey pulled into her driveway in her car, a Jaguar she bought at Faulkner Motors a few years ago.¬† Audrey tried to run to Jim‚Äôs driveway as fast as she could in high heels (she was also wearing a burgundy business suit).¬† As soon as Audrey looked at the SUV, she said, ‚ÄúJim, I like this.¬† This is a good choice, especially with your family of five daughters.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, Audrey.¬† I feel I made a good choice.‚Äù

Autumn looked inside the SUV.¬† Rebecca and Jake were both impressed by Jim‚Äôs choice.¬† They all said pretty much the same thing.¬† While April Lynn was looking inside, Jim asked her, ‚ÄúApril Lynn, who were you talking to on your cell phone?‚Äù

April Lynn answered, ‚ÄúI spoke to Russell and Scout Gilmore, and the Crabtree bunch.¬† I told them to come over and see your new vehicle.‚Äù

Sure enough, they did.¬† Autumn and Alex, along with Tim and his daughters, showed up to check out the Cadillac Escalade.¬† The Gilmore bunch showed up in Scout‚Äôs truck.¬† Russell, Paulina, Crystal and her kids, Amina and Cassie were riding in the bed of the truck.¬† Pam was riding with Scout in the cab.¬† Vince drove behind Scout in his El Camino.¬† He brought Nikki and Marissa with him.¬† Tia drove behind Vince in her 1965 Cadillac.¬† While they were checking out the SUV, Jonathan brought the Marlowe bunch in his classic Bronco.¬† Then, Simon showed up, bringing Ariel, Jodi and Charmaine with him.¬† Ariel was pushing a stroller carrying the twin girls, Kaci and Lucy.¬† Everyone seemed impressed by Jim‚Äôs choice.¬† Later in the evening, Kurt, Hannah, Summer and Jeremy showed up, bringing Randy and Lori Barrett with them.¬† They saw the SUV as well.¬† The others, including Jim‚Äôs mother and half-siblings (Emily and Charlie, along with Rachel and Jerry), Malachi and Stacy Holbrook and their kids, and Amy Courtland and her kids, would see Jim‚Äôs Escalade during the weekend.

¬†

üòä

¬†

The weekend came and went.¬† Jim and his family rode around Charlotte some in the Escalade.¬† On Saturday, Chelsea finally bought her first car, that dark gray 2001 Camaro she was looking at.

On Sunday evening, Jim decided on something.¬† Using the idea he found in that magazine Simon gave him, Jim would use his die-cast car collection to pop the question to Sydney.

He would set that special moment for the second weekend in November.",0,1730031159.0,writers,1,0.5,False
