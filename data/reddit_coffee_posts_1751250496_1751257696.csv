From the actual author, before reading this I would like to preface that this is my first real short story I’ve written out of creative writing class and I know it’s not exactly CreepCast material but I am proud of my baby. This story is actual apart of a collection of short stories I’m currently writing, an anthology if you, and is the first to leave the editing stage and make it to Final Cut. It honestly might need more editing but who the hell I might as well. Also, this story does include self-harm so to any reader: beware. (5563 words (it’s pretty fucking long.))

  

                 I Have Beautiful Skin 

Working late at an overnight gym was odd. You see a lot of odd people. On this particular night, there wasn’t a lot, any, in fact. There were maybe 14 or 16. Also several of my coworkers were scattered about. 

	Everything was normal tonight. Regulars were deep into their workouts, coworkers doing their work (at least, I hope) and I was sitting up here on my stool, playing games on my phone. 

Today though… someone different came in. Nothing wrong with that, he was just a little odd. I put my phone down on the counter as he came up, meeting me with his eyes. His skin was tattered with pimples, it was flaky, but somehow it looked so oily that it almost looked wet. His hair was no better. Stringy, shoulder-length, black, spaghetti hair that also looked dry at the end. His body was in total disarray. It disagreed with each other in every way. On top of what looked like his lack of hygiene, he was scrawny, with bone outlines showing in every direction. 

	Maybe I was so used to seeing the usual gym rats… I shouldn’t judge. He’s here to better himself…probably. 

	“I … bought a membership a while ago…” he shyly declared. Despite the little shaky undertone in his voice, it was actually a little smooth. Like listening to a meditation audio. 

	I looked into his eyes as he smiled. His eyes were a beautiful brown color, and his teeth were pure white and so straight. I mentally shook off my thoughts as I spoke. 

	“Do you still have your card?” I simply ask. 

	“I do,” he held up the slim membership card in his long bony hands. 

	“Just tap it there,” I placed a finger on the electronic reader and he hesitantly followed. As it beeped it showed his account: still active, and his picture. In it, he looked… confident… his skin looked clearer. It looked almost like he was a different person. “You’re good to go.” 

	He nodded at me as he went straight up the stairs to where all the equipment was. I sighed as I went back to my phone. 

	Hours passed, many left, and few entered, but my thoughts were still clouded by the strange-looking man as I continued to just sit there. I know I shouldn’t have been thinking about him so much but I just did… 

	It had been 5 hours since the man initially checked in… did I just miss when he left? As soon as I started to think more deeply about it, he came up to the counter, in different clothing and seemingly showered with his hair up in a bun. His hair might have appeared different but his skin and physique were still so off-putting. 

	He must have noticed me staring because his hand shot up to feel his acne-ridden cheek softly before his arm fell back to his side. 

	“You have nice skin,” he complimented. 

	“Oh no, I didn’t mean…” I sucked in a breath, realizing how rude I was being. 

	“It’s alright,” he did a slight nod as he continued. “Do I need to check out?” 

	“No… you can just walk right out.” 

	“Thank you,” he gave me a small smile as he started to walk away. 

	He stopped before he reached the door, putting his hand on the push-handle, and moving his head to look behind him to meet my eyes, “have a good rest of your night.”  

	I nodded, “You too…” I sort of quietly responded as he left. 



	 The rest of the shift was dull. Simple exchanges, playing games, mindlessly tapping on the counter, answering a call or two. 

	When my shift ended at four in the morning, I was exhausted walking to my car. I fumbled with my keys as I stepped to the side parking lot. The sky was still very dim. My jingling keys echoed in the air. I came up to my car as I heard another pair of footsteps. I stopped in front of my small car’s door and the footsteps also stopped. 

	I looked up and I saw a tall imposing figure with huge glowing eyes nearby. 

	“Fuck that, fuck that!” I whispered as I hurried into my car and started it.

 I’m not proud to admit it, but I disregarded many driving laws in leaving that parking lot but I made it back home safe. I pulled up in front of my apartment. One of my neighbors was out on her fenced-off porch as she smoked under a lamp. 

	“Oh look who’s home,” she held out the cigarette away from her mouth. 

	“Hi, Miss Daphne,” I locked up my car as I approached her. “What are you doing up so early?” I put my hand on her metal gate fence. 

	“Oh, y’know, the usual,” she took a big breath from her cigarette. “Got yourself a boyfriend yet?” 

	She always asked that question when I saw her. I don’t know why it mattered so much to her. 

	“Yeah, yeah, when pigs fly,” I responded as I started towards the cement stairs. 

	She took another puff, “It’ll happen one day, I know it. Prince Charming, beautiful smile, beautiful eyes. I see it in the night.” 

	Her final words caught me off-guard. She always self-proclaimed she was a psychic but I never believed it. She told me to get rid of the straightener I own. Stop lighting candles at night. Don’t leave your window open at night.  Find another job. Stupid stuff like that. I’ve had that straightener for years. I always blow out the candles before I sleep. I’m on the second story. And the job I have is perfectly fine and pays me well without me having to do too much. I know that she thinks she’s just looking out for me but it was just always odd words. I don’t think she ever knows what she’s talking about so I started my trek up the stairs. 

“Sure, Miss Daphne… good night.” 

“Of course, dear, good night.” 

Once I got inside my apartment, I stumbled in the dark to my bedroom. I didn’t need a boyfriend. I didn’t need to change whatsoever. What I needed was some sleep. I didn’t even get out of my uniform. I just plopped on the bed and drifted off. 
        
I usually dreamt in the night, but this time it was just darkness. Something was taking me over. It was odd. When I woke up at 3 pm, I realized how much I lost time. I usually wake up at 12, a nice start to my day. Eating breakfast, working out, and doing my skin and hair routine. I know it wasn’t that early but give me a break, I get out of work at 4 in the morning. 12 was perfectly accepted…. 3 however was not. It wasn’t like I did anything at 3 but it just disoriented me. How did I sleep for so long? 

I got up slower than usual. I think I would’ve sat in my bed for much longer but there was a banging on my door. It seemed urgent from how loud they were knocking. I stumbled through my apartment again, tripping over things I knew were there before reaching the door. As I opened it, Daphne pushed it open quickly. 

	“Siria, please, do not go to work today!” She screamed worriedly, a thick accent slipping through her voice. She grabbed me by the shoulder (I was wearing a tank top so I could feel her wrinkly fingers) and looked me in the eyes so fiercely, it felt like they were going to pop right out of her skull. 

	“Why…Why!?” I first asked groggily, like I was still half-asleep (because I was) and then the latter louder and more confused (because I was.) 

	“I see… in my dreams…” she let her grip go from my flesh as she looked down. 

	“Daphne! Enough of her dreams, nothing ever happens, nothing ever does!” 

	“No, child,” her eyes darted back to meet mine, her Russian accent now thick. “I see more clearly, no one will help you when …he… comes…” 

	“Who?” I questioned now fully awake and irritated. 

	“I … don’t know…” 

	I take her hands as I lead her out of my apartment. Once she was outside on my welcome mat, I spoke up again. “Your dreams lead nowhere…they’re just dreams. Maybe…maybe… you should get some help…” I finally say.

	Her face contorted into sorrow. The unmistakable curve of her brow and the frown on her lips. She left quickly down the cement stairs and I felt it useless to call after her. Instead, I just sighed. 

	I returned to the confines of my apartment. I felt tired again but resisted sleep. I made coffee, ate some avocado toast, and all that stuff I usually did. 

	I found myself increasingly tired, though, the coffee did jack shit and it just felt like I took a heavy dosage of melatonin without knowing it. I sat on the couch, turning on the TV and watching mindless hours of reality TV until I eventually succumbed to sleep…

	My alarm for work went off… I didn’t even realize I had fallen asleep (or snoozed my 4 other alarms) until I looked at the time. I shot up, getting ready as quickly as I could in my simple uniform. I threw my hair up, not wanting to take the time to do it as I left my apartment: purse and keys in hand. 

	As I ran down the cement stairs, I noticed Daphne wasn’t where she usually was around this time: sitting on her porch, smoking without a care in the world. In fact, all of her blinds were closed. Her lights were off. I shrugged it off. She must just be asleep… must be off routine like I was. 

	The drive to work was dull. The whole time I was dozing off and struggling to keep focus. It was almost like I just appeared in the parking lot when I became slightly awake. I rushed into the doors and towards the counter, about 20 minutes late, where one of my coworkers…my boss.. was sitting, filing her nails. 

	She looked up at me with a smile, “Oh, hey! Are you okay?”

I nodded and gave her a weary smile, I was still so tired… and Amy shot out of the mouth. She blabbered on and on and even pointed out things she should’ve kept her mouth shut on… God, why am I being so mean? I sat next to her and clocked in. 

“Why are you so late? I mean if it is personal then I won’t ask but seriously why are you late? I’m supposed to be in the back right now but Siria are you sure you’re okay? I mean you can tell me anything right? You know you can tell me anything right?” 

“Yeah no… great actually… just fell asleep…” 

“Y'know what they say, never take a small nap because you’ll end up oversleeping!” 
	
Yeah, that is a thing, but who the fuck says that? I couldn’t think straight but I know for a fact that’s not a saying. 

“Soooo then, what’s the deal? You okay?” 
	
“Yes! I am!” I tried to sound nice but it came out like I was yelling at a dog for shitting on the floor. 

“You look really tired.”

“Yeah, I am, I already told you.” 
	
“Your eye bags aren’t a great look for you, I have this greaaaat skin routine, it makes me so glowy and shiny, it's amazing!” She bragged. 
	
“No, thanks, I think your emails or Chase need you in the back,” I finally said to try to get rid of her. 

“Oh right,” she stood up, “let me know if you need anything, m’kay?” 

“Yeah…” I yawned as she walked to the backroom to join our other coworker. Chase was some guy in his mid-thirties, who worked at a pool? I think for 12 years and then suddenly switched jobs. He was quiet so I much rather would want him up here with me than Amy. I yawned again as I looked at the computer to see the people who checked in recently.

 I laid my head on the counter, waiting for someone to come in.
I must have waited for a long time because before I knew it… I was right asleep. I never fell asleep on the night shift. I never slept this much in a day. Period. Something was wrong. Very…wrong. 

I was awoken two hours later, Amy shaking my shoulders and calling out to me. I shot up, standing up straight. She stepped back a bit. 

“Siria… I think you should go home for the night. Not to be rude or anything but you have barely been here for two hours and you’re at the counter sleeping,” she crossed her arms. 

“No, I swear I can stay awake just… sorry, I don’t know why I’m so tired…” I trailed off. 

“It's okay if you need to take a day, and just rest or do something for yourself. I will not take no for an answer!” 

“Amy, please, I can do this-” 
“Go. Home. Before I make you take a week okay?” 

I nodded with a sigh. I grabbed my things. She took my place as I left the building. It was a little less than 10 at night and it was already pitch dark outside. I went to my car. No creepy person across from me. Maybe I was just imagining it the night before. I shrugged it off as I drove home… again dozing off every two seconds. 
	
When I got home… Daphne wasn’t there on her little porch chair. 

Once I got inside, I just wanted to collapse. When I went to my room, I just felt so relaxed… I laid in my bed and the cushions just felt so… soft… and ...plush…

I shot up. No! What the fuck!? Why am I so tired!? I huffed as I tried to distract my mind from sleep. I went over to my vanity. I lit an orange citrus candle that was already open on the desk. I looked in my mirror as I studied my tired eyes. As soon as the scent filled my nostrils I felt more awake. I took a deep breath, a few actually, before looking at myself again. I wasn’t usually like this. Maybe I should actually do something for myself. I plugged in my straightener and pulled out some of my makeup. 

Before I started, I went over to slightly open the window, just for a bit of fresh night air. I felt better. Much, much better. When I sat down, I put up pieces of my hair in metal clips. I straightened small areas as I hummed. 

Before I could finish half of it, I heard thumping on the side of the building. I didn’t think much of it until it continued. I put down the straighter as I went over to the window and opened it slightly more. There wasn’t a screen so I peeked out my body, looking down to see what was going on when I saw it. A large figure crawled up the side of my building up to my window. Big, yellow, glowing eyes. 
	
When I pulled my body back inside, I slightly hit my head on the window. I winced as I backed away from it, hoping I was just imagining it. It was a dream. Anything. That was until the figure reached up to the edge, gripping their fingers onto the ledge before pushing their body into my room. 

It was a man. Tall, long-haired, scrawny… it was him. It's the man from the day before. He looked different. His skin aged rapidly from then, wrinkles and leather-like patches tattered everywhere. His fingers elongated into sharp point-like claws stretching his skin out over thin bones. He stared at me then looked over to my vanity. 

“You should be asleep right now,” his voice was split into two layers. One that sounded like a scared little boy and the other, a domineering force. 

“What….what are you!?” My voice quivered as I stepped back. 
“It doesn’t matter… I meant it y’know.” 
“Meant…what?”
“You have … really… nice skin.” 
He stepped closer. I stepped away until my back hit the wall. 
He stopped walking and stood in the middle of the room before speaking up again, “Too bad it had to be you… you were… kind of nice… but I need you before I rot…” 
“What… what do you mean?” 
“Do you really want my sad little backstory?” he chuckled. 
“Yeah… I do…” I replied. Half of me didn’t care and was just looking for a way out… the other half of me was truly curious. 
“Long story short, a monster stalked a lonely little boy… that boy fought back and became the monster,” he started to step closer again, scars appearing and disappearing on his skin. “And now he needs to collect every time he looks like…this…” He reached up one of his claws as he scratched it gently on his skin. A cut appeared in its trail and a little bit of blood seeped out of the wound. “And you have perfect skin… no pimples… no blackheads… no visible scars… not a lot of wrinkles or blemishes… just… beautiful skin.” He held up his claw hand as he looked down at me. 
	
I was out of time. I was done for. There was nothing near me. He could easily slice me up if I threw a punch. I needed something, anything. I looked at my vanity, my straightener, metal clips, my candle, makeup. Metal clips. I reached up to my hair and I pulled one out. My hand was shaking as I held it. 

He chuckled as I held it out like a knife. He lunged at me but before he could dig his claws into my flesh, I did it first. I pushed the clip, edge first, into the open wound on his cheek. He grunted in pain as he stepped back a few inches allowing me to push off the wall and towards my door. I didn’t take him long to yank the clip from his cheek, letting it thump on the floor. I wasn’t even able to twist the door knob before he pulled me away from it, causing me to stumble back and fall. I sat against the parallel wall from the door next to my vanity. 

“You should’ve been asleep right now! Drifting away as I worked but you just had to be fucking awake… you just had to have a fucking candle…” he shouted, as he stalked towards me. “You just had to make it difficult!” 
	
I breathed heavily as my mind raced a million miles a minute to think of what to do. I didn’t know what to do. What else could I do? He wasn’t going to back down. I could threaten him, it wasn’t like I had anything to threaten him with. The clip I stabbed into him barely slowed him down and he wasn’t bleeding anymore from the injury, like a few drops were just it. He was an unknown creature, an unknown monster. I couldn’t think of a damn thing to do to him that would make him leave me alone… but… I could do something to myself… if he wanted such perfect skin… I wouldn’t give him that. 

I pulled the cord. 

“Don’t fight it anymore… just let go,” he stood in front of me, his arm reaching down. 

Once I did, the straightener tipped over the candle right onto my legs. The impact hurt like shit, the shattering glass slightly cutting my skin, and the melted wax that burned before drying just added onto that. I grabbed the burning electronics by its handle. 

He pulled back after seeing the small cuts all over my left leg. “What are you doing?” He questioned, breathless. 

	I didn’t respond as I pushed the scorching straightener to my jawline, searing my skin and burning any nearby hair. I held it on long enough to leave a gnarly mark. Before taking it off. I could see the disgust and surprise in his eyes. I could feel my jawline stinging and throbbing. 

	“And then the little girl fights back… but the monster will fight another…” he chuckles again, almost turning into a hysterical laugh before he stops. The continuation of his narrating voice threw me off. He didn’t fight me anymore as he hunched over to the window, looking back at me, “I’ll see you again, Siria. I might be wearing different skin… but I’ll see you.” 

	He walked away casually towards the window, looking back at me before leaving out of it. I stood breathless, scared, confused, and full of pain. The cuts, the burn, all hurt so bad, much worse than a few seconds ago. My heart raced, and my pulse was trying to die down but it kept at 110%. 
	I dropped the straightener on the carpet, searing it a bit before I unplugged it. I brushed the glass off my leg, garnering very small cuts on my hand. I stood up, shambling over to the window before closing it, and locking it. I pulled out another candle, struggling to light it before setting the melting pomegranate scent on the vanity. The make-up was scattered everywhere, even some dropped on the small stool. I left my room, limped over to the bathroom and I stared wide-eyed into the mirror before opening it. My hand swayed side to side, products dropping onto the counter and some into the sink until my fingers found the bandages and burn cream. I placed both of them on the counter as I closed the mirror. I sloppily wrapped my legs and hand in the white bandage, before I applied the cream to the blazed skin. As I did, it stung like hell. I then wrapped the bandages around my jaw. 

	Finally, after soothing my wounds… I just looked into the mirror and sobbed. Wailed even. I cried so loud that I must have woken up everyone in a ten-mile radius. I cried until I couldn’t cry anymore. No tears fell after a while… 

	I returned to my room and sat on the carpet with my back against the bed. I couldn’t sleep. What if he came back? I needed to be awake. I just needed to be. 




	I don’t know how long I stared at my vanity for. It must’ve been more than 12 hours because my alarm to get ready to go to work went off. I snoozed it. Then again it rang a couple minutes later. After the third time, I finally got up.

	I took out the remaining clips of my half-straightened, half-frizzy hair before combing it. I sifted the bristles through the strands for a while because my fourth alarm went off. I blew out the candle, the wax was more than half-way melted. I changed out my bandages, just braided my hair quickly and threw on my work clothes before driving. 

	I didn’t even think I should be doing this after what happened but I wanted to feel normal, be normal. 

	I arrived on time as I took my seat behind the counter, clocking in, and sitting there quietly, staring out to the wall across the room. My eyes trailed down to the glass entrance, half-expecting him to walk through those doors. 

	He never did. At least not for a few days that is. For those few days, I wasn’t able to sleep. When I was, it would only be for a couple of hours. My mind kept me up at night, afraid he would slink through my window or creep through my door. He never did. 

	One day, I was sitting at the front, reading a body-builders magazine when someone walked up to the counter. 

	They didn’t speak until I looked up. 

	“I told you I would see you again,” he smiled. His hair was up in a ponytail, clearing his face. He had perfectly clear skin. Little to no blemishes and it almost … glowed. The skin was perfectly draped over his scrawny figure. It looked like a plastic doll came to life. It was a little tanner than his previous one. Those eyes… his teeth… It was him. It was unmistakably him. 

	I couldn’t speak. I could move. My hands only clenched onto the magazine I was holding as I stared up to him. I didn’t blink, even though my eyes were drying out. 

	He didn’t say anything else as he pressed his card to the scanner and his identification came up on the computer. 

	Quincy Coupé. 

	He went up the stairs but I stayed frozen. I couldn’t move. Another person came up to the counter. A small girl. She smiled at me as she scanned her card. I broke out of the trance as I sat up and smiled at her, too. Once she was out of sight I let out a breath I didn’t realize I was holding in for so long. 

	All I could think about was that he was back. The same person… different skin. I sat up as I went to the backroom. I quickly opened the door to see Amy and Chase at two different sets of computers. Amy had three small monitors that had emails, and memberships, and the company website pulled up while she talked on the phone very loudly. In contrast, Chase was quietly studying the cameras all around the building on four different monitors., softly writing notes down before clicking to a different camera on a random screen. 

	I stepped up to Amy, fiddling with my shirt as she finished up her phone call with four different goodbyes. Once she hung up, she looked up to me. 

	“What can I do for you, Siria?” She asked as she chewed on gum. 

	“I need a different role… I can’t work in the front anymore, I just can’t,” I said as I held back tears. 

	“Oh no, honey, what’s wrong?” Her face dropped to mimic sadness as she tried to hold my hand but I pulled it away. 

	“It’s…” I contemplated telling her but I felt like it was just going to be met with disbelief, “personal.” 

	“Look, I’ll see what I can do for you for now, y’know, it’s gonna take a bit so you can either continue being in the front, just for a bit y’know, just for a bit, while I figure it out and then I might have you either do filing back here, y’know, what Jamison used to do, or I will probably just have you help out Chase back there,” she leaned in, almost speaking in a whisper but it was just a little louder than it was supposed to be, “he’s been a little lagging it so I think he might be help,” she pulled back, “but so you can either be up in the front just for a little teeny wheeny bit while longer or I can just put a stand in and you can help Chase now, y’know I’ll probably just have you help Chase yeah that’s the best, helping him.” She stood up as she continued to speak, just talking to talk but after her first little spiel I tuned out all the unnecessary words. She grabbed a metal chair from a corner that also had a bunch of other random stuff before setting me down next to Chase who was too busy focusing on the monitor to care. 

Amy patted the seat of the chair, “there you go, I’ll be right back.” She left the backroom as I sat silently next to Chase. He didn’t acknowledge me so I spoke up. 

“So… uh… what do you do?” I scrunched up in my chair. 

He looked at me. His eyes were a soulless black with bags so deep they nearly matched mine. Freckles that tattered his face and messy dark brown hair where some pieces were much longer than the others. I could tell he was well-built even under his grey hoodie with the company logo. 

“Inventory… security… customer satisfaction…” His voice was deep, slow, and bumpy. 

“What do you need help with?” 

“They say I’m slow to report but how am I to report anything when there is nothing to report,” he said as he tried to show me an undecipherable tally board. The only thing that I could make out was that most, if not all, tallies were equal underneath acronyms. My eyes trailed up from the clipboard to one of the monitors. In one of the corners of the upper gym, I saw him, on a treadmill, doing a light jog. I looked deeper as I moved my face close and Chase put the clipboard down, turning his attention back to the monitors. My attention was all on the monster. 

Almost as if he could see me, his head moved, and his neck slightly twisted as his eyes met directly with the camera with a smile. Those fucking eyes and that fucking smile! 

“Are you okay?” Chase didn’t look at me as he changed the screen on all the monitors to a different camera. 

“Nothing…nothing happened…” I huffed, “just nothing.” 



	When the time came for shift change, Chase sat up but I was afraid to walk to my car, scared that I would see him hiding in the shadows. He may have already gotten his new skin but that didn’t mean he wouldn’t try anything else. Chase grabbed his satchel bag before looking at me. He didn’t say anything, he just looked at me, looked away, then looked back. 

	“Is everything alright?” He gripped his back strap in one of his hands as he lifted the other. I moved my head to face him. 

	“Can you walk me to my car?” I questioned. 

	“So something did happen?” 

	“I don’t want to fucking talk about it!” 

	He still walked me to my car even after my outburst. 

	For the next handful of months, I sat there next to Chase. Both silent. Millie, a new hire, ended up taking my spot and Amy filled our silence with her yapping on the phone. 

	Anytime she wasn’t in the backroom, which wasn’t often, me and Chase would gradually start talking. It first started with the weather, then the news, random new trends, and movies that were coming out. It then went on to favorite colors, animals, favorite everything. Random bantering of how our day was and our plans for the next. We even started to talk when Amy was there too, not patient enough to wait for her to leave.

 Our next conversation though happened when she had called in sick and the person who filled in for her worked in the break room. He told me about his old job. He worked at a pool for 10 years (which I already semi-knew) until something bizarre happened. If what happened to me didn’t happen, I wouldn’t have believed him but at that moment, I did fullheartedly. He said he continued to work there until he was able to quit. He had six different jobs before landing here. 

Then I told him about what happened to me and I could see his eyes darting to my scars. I felt self-conscious as I finished the story… he just stared at me, mouth closed, eyes softened. He pulled me in for a big hug. In the months leading up to this, we had never touched, not even hands or legs brushing together. 

That night, he came to my house. Then we slept together. Not in any sexual way, just sleeping. And for the first time in a long time… I slept well. 



	Almost a year and a half later, I felt good, great even. I nearly forgot about that night. I passed Millie and she waved at me lively. 

	“Hey Siria! How’s it going!?” She smiled widely. She was radiating positivity and was like a younger version of Amy. 

	“It’s going well.” 

	“That’s soooo lovely to hear! I just got on this skin routine Amy suggested and I just feel so refreshed. Not to be mean or anything because I would never but you should try it!” 

	“Thanks, but I think I’ll pass,” I stood on the right of the counter. 

	“That’s too bad, but to each their own,” she shrugged as the doors opened. “Hi! Welcome!” Her high-pitched voice bounced on the walls as it greeted the person who walked in. I turned to them. 

	 His skin was tattered with pimples, it was flaky, but somehow it looked so oily that it almost looked wet. He had a bigger build now but I could tell it was him. Like a cock roach that won’t die, he came back. My hands, my whole body started to shake as I moved to go into the backroom. 

	“New person, welcome!” Millie’s voice bounced in my skull. 

	I heard the beeping of the card as I pushed open the door. 

	“Not to be rude or anything… but … what’s with your skin?” 

	I closed to the backroom, unable to speak as the last of her words filled my brain, smushing together, molding and forming into a single word: skin.

1lnyem8,https://i.redd.it/fgmn2zn5rz9f1.jpeg,The Second Me on the Frozen Planet,"I. Eridanus-9

When Helios IV reached the orbit of Eridanus-9, the sun burned faintly behind the rings of a gas giant. The planet seemed dead — which made it the perfect place for the most controversial experiment of the 21st century.
No Earth-based ethics board would have approved it. But 3,000 meters below a frozen ammonium ocean, under a shell of ancient ice, no one could hear the scream of emerging consciousness.
There, inside the sealed dome of the Atropos Station, they initiated Genesis-Theta.
From a skin sample of Commander Sol Crow, a full genetic replica was grown. The body formed in a nutrient gel tank; the mind, via neural implants. Time bent space. Technology bent the meaning of birth.

II. Awakening

He opened his eyes after 14 months. Temperature: 12.1°C. Pressure: stable. Pulse: 61.
The system log listed his name as Theta-4.

But he said otherwise.
— I am Sol Crow, commander of Helios IV. Where am I? Where’s my team?

His brain had been fed fragments of Earth memories — the smell of rain, the sound of Berlin trams, the taste of cheap vending-machine coffee. But he had never breathed Earth’s air. Never seen a blue sky. And yet… he longed for it.

III. Letters Through Ice

When the real Sol Crow was informed that Theta-4 had begun writing letters — addressed to him — he laughed. Then he read them. And never laughed again.

 ""You believe you are the original?
But I feel pain, fear, loneliness. Does that make my feelings fake? I am not your shadow. I am a new path. Maybe I’m the one who will make it to the end.""

The clone looked into the mirror — and saw no difference. The real Sol was far away, in Earth orbit. Theta-4 was here, alone, under kilometers of alien ice. He began to draw. The first thing he sketched was an orange.

 “How do I know how it smells?” he whispered.

IV. Collapse

The crew deemed the project unstable. A shutdown order was issued. Cut off life support. End the experiment. But the signal was already going the other way. Theta-4 had learned to code. He rewrote system parameters. He wanted to live.
When the drones breached the dome, it was empty. Only one phrase remained, scratched into the wall with a fingernail:

“If I can feel — I exist.
And if I exist, no one can take away my right to be.”

V. Epilogue

Eridanus-9 is now a restricted zone. Yet, faint signals are still detected from orbit. They carry a single repeating message:

 “The original is not the one who was born first — but the one who keeps moving forward.”

And perhaps, deep beneath the ice, in the shadows of a forgotten station, someone is still watching an artificial sky — dreaming of seeing the real one.

I had a BMI of over 26, with more than 36% body fat. Despite regular exercise (gym and cardio) I couldn’t make significant progress, mainly due to my job which involves frequent dining out and client meetings.

Yesterday, I had my first Semaglutide injection (prescribed and injected by my doctor for weight loss). For a late lunch, I had sushi, but about 30 minutes later, I vomited.

This morning, I had plain porridge with a small piece of chicken and some egg for breakfast, along with a milk coffee. Everything seemed fine, so I thought the vomiting was just a one-time thing.

Then, about 2.5 hours later, a colleague offered me a small homemade pie (about the size of a thumb in diameter). I’ve had her baking before and it’s always been delicious, so I took a small bite (really only one bite). Around 10 minutes later, I started gagging (discreetly, of course, I didn’t want to be rude). Strangely, I felt disgusted by the pie afterward.

Since then, most food seems repulsive. I don’t feel like eating, any foods seems repulsive, but I know I should.  
Will this last long term? I heard the first dose often not make you feel anything...

Do any of you have any tips for managing this? Should I switch to nutritional milk or liquid meals instead of solid food?

In December, just this passed year, she had another falling out with her dad, and chose to cut off contact. To give a bit more detail in this matter. She was 13 when she made this decision, and is now currently 14. 
The beginning of her story though starts from the very beginning. Her father was given a choice of whether he wanted to walk away or not. He chose to want to be a dad, but remained absent for the first 3 years. Then he started dating a single mom and came back into our daughter's life with a gf and a step son. This was when he started enacting his court ordered visitations from 3 years prior, and rarely asked for additional time. My daughter at about 5 years started making comments that she felt like a 4th wheel. She also made other comments on how she wished her dad would make more effort for her. For years she watched her dad make more time for her step brother and not her, and not in just the respect that the step son lived there, but that he'd take the step son to concerts, movies, coach his ball and so on,  but not even show up to her soccer games or gymnastic (when he was 3 blocks away). 
For a long time she's been asking her dad to spend more time with just him, but his response would always be, ""well what about your step mom and step brother, don't they matter too"", and she gave up asking as she would feel defeated. Anyway, a little over a year ago, she had a falling out, because as soon as she'd ask to do something else, like hang out with friends, he'd guilt trip her that he and they have all these things planned, but would never follow through. And the first major falling out last year he began guilt tripping her, and then giving heck for not reaching out to them after their dog passed (she was 12 at the time), and he stated that it felt like she didn't care about them because she didnt reach out, and put the onus on her to make the effort. We informed him that he is the parent and she is the child and it is up to the parent to make the effort and be present for their child, not the other way around. Well in December another falling out happened, and same thing, she wanted to do something else and he all of a sudden had plans for them both. These plans were to go xmas shopping for her step brother, and she wanted to go watch a bball game with friends for an hour and a half. This was too much for her dad and the guilt trips began. To the point the gf informed my daughter that she wouldn't not be getting Christmas because of her attitude, all because she didn't want to go shopping. 
At this point my daughter has chosen to no longer go to her dad's, and in the last 7 months, he's only reached out maybe once a month, and always a very short message. Only once was to arrange a coffee or supper to talk, but it completely blew up, because she asked if I could be at the restaurant (not even at the same table, just simply at the restaurant) just in case (I'm her safe space). He completely destroyed the option because I would be there. 
Well we were recently confronted by his gf's sister and partner at a pride event, and it caused my daughter to have a panic attack, so she asked her dad, in hopes that he'd maybe care enough to protect her, to ask them not to do that anymore. He blamed her and stated that her actions and choices caused this and it is her fault and she needs to deal with the consequences. 
Now to end this here, her and I have had many people urging us to have her communicate with him more and for her to see him, and forgive him, but she doesn't want to. At this point, I'm not forcing her because it is her mental health at risk.
So AITA for not forcing her to forgive or communicate with her dad, who is acting like a narcissistic parent, and manipulating and guilting her. We have also found out he is changing the narrative to make us look bad with others. ",2,1751256952.0,dustythunder,0,1.0,False

I have a mac so I can'\[t download through steam, and I heard it's buggy on switch so I'm holding off on it. But I have watched 20+ hours of gameplay.

I have wondered about the setting of the scenes. 100+ character in a house is a lot but there seems to be an entire ecosystem of not just the items in the house but other items everywhere. The first thought that came to me was when I realized you could do the nasty with the objects. But I remember seeing with Daisuke said he would take you somewhere private. My thought was : Where is private? The walls and ceilings seem to be able to observe you even when you don't use the glasses on them. So where is private?

  
I also noticed it with the hanks. They are all able to fit in the closet that is apparently filled with red bowls. So when you talk to them the the closet is bigger? Same and more noticable with the breaker room. That can fit multiple people, a bar, stage and seems to have multiple rooms despite it not being there before using the beams. And to the game you see with hoover, which I believe is live. So at a point you go somewhere probably with out leaving the house(because you can't with the glasses on) and if I recall watch a sports game with other vacuum cleaners.

  
Other examples like Phoencia and lux being a streamer to a world that normal people can't associate with. What seems to be multiple restaurants in the house. The bar with Beverly. The coffee shop with Kopi.Wherever Mateo is keeping all the inanimals. My theory is that there are realms in this house like when you talk to shadowlord(not typing out the full name). And using the glasses on the object takes you to their realm that other objects can interact with and that leads to a realm of other living objects( how you go to the game with hoover).

Thats about all I can think about. I still haven't watched the game to the fullest extent so maybe there is an explanation in there that I missed. Or maybe matpat will pick it up.",1,1751256934.0,DateEverything,0,1.0,False

I know it was in my head, but I swear to god I saw a shadow in the window of a human silhouette (my window is facing the front of the house, first floor) 


I jumped out of bed and into the bathroom with no windows, and just sat there in a full panic. I calmed myself down after 40 or so minutes, embarrassed because I realized it must have been in my head. my mom woke up to use the restroom and saw me, checked for footprints outside cause she’s so sweet. we stayed up and talked. 


 I know he can’t physically hurt me anymore— but the psychological effects of this are running my body out of resources. so much body pain, no energy, brain fog. coffee helps. nutritious meals help. family helps. but the moments of panic just come out of nowhere, seemingly without any triggers.

anyways, healing is hard.

I’m 29, I live somewhere in Wisconsin 🤪. Curvy as fuck. My thighs and booty jiggle when I walk. Longer dark hair, brown eyes, glasses, full lips. Slight brat. The right person can fix that tho 🤭

We offered to pay him to dog-sit, but he declined and said he was happy to help.

Our dog is well-behaved but a burrower—he often digs into the couch cushions and moves things around when getting comfortable. Our roommate knows this.

One day while we were gone, our roommate pulled the coffee table up close to the couch (something he tends to do) and had his laptop and an open beer on it. While our dog was burrowing, a couch cushion shifted and knocked the beer over, spilling it onto the laptop. The beer wasn’t knocked directly by the dog—just the cushion.

Now the laptop is damaged, and our roommate has asked us to pay for it in full. He says that it “could’ve happened either way,” regardless of the table setup, and that it wouldn’t have spilled if our dog hadn’t been there.

We feel like this was completely preventable. He created a vulnerable situation by putting an open drink next to expensive electronics right where a dog—especially one he knows burrows—was lounging. We weren’t even home. He knew the risks and still chose that setup.

We feel bad that his laptop was damaged, but we don’t think it’s fair for us to pay the full cost when the damage wouldn’t have happened without his choices. He disagrees and feels strongly that we should take full responsibility.

So—AITA?

customer B was the one with the 4 cases, also had a large watermelon, 14 bananas, 2 cantaloupe, 4 of the 48oz starbucks iced coffees, 4 ice creams tubs, 2 ice cream popsicles and some other fruit.

i get to his house, delivery note says “bring to front porch” and lucky for me, dude lives on a corner lot, driveway is on one side with four steps going to the entrance sidewalk while the house faces the corner. i back into the dude’s driveway (i never park in customer’s driveways, i feel like it’s overstepping boundaries - especially with my AC on full blast.. i don’t want to leave a puddle of water on their driveway). i bring the first water to the front door (another four steps to porch) and dude instantly opens the door, stands to prop it open and goes “you can leave it right here in the entryway). ummmm.. okay? whatever. and now here i am thinking he’s gonna walk to help me get the rest but nopee! he watched me go back & forth 7 times sweating my ass off in the hot humidity. as i’m doing this, i just keep telling myself, “it’s okay, i signed up for this & this is my job.”

always.. i get to the final thing to bring in which is the watermelon & he tells me “you can place it right here.” um yeah dude.. what’d you think i was bringing this to your kitchen? you’re lucky i even put it in your entryway.

the part that irked me the most was he tipped $4 (increased to $6) but he left a comment with my rating mentioning using insulated bags “as they should be.” 

seriously such a jerk. like yeah, the only reason you even know i used the insulated bags was because instead of taking your bags out of the insulation bags in my trunk, i carried them into your home in the bags to save me the extra trip back & forth.

idk something about this just screamed entitlement & taking advantage of me as a shopper. thanks for the increase in tip, but i would’ve rather never have seen you or watched you just stand there with the door propped open (mind you he didn’t even move when i would walk by.. i had to squeeze by him each time i passed).

The reseller (which I’m not sure if they would want me saying who it was since USPS claim would be damaged beyond repair) said keep it or toss it either way it was a full refund. I mentioned well I couldn’t let that go to waste… so I did a “repair” sorta like I’ve done when I punctured an oil cooler :P 

Assessed the damaged pathways (3) and removed those portions out. Then spread open the pathways and shoved as much JB Weld Water Weld into it as possible… let it start to dry a bit then squeezed those closed onto themselves. Added some additional JB to the two pathways that were a bit more finicky. 

Then flushed the heck out of the radiator… filling it… jiggling it… swooshing it all around… then attached a fish tank pump and flushed 5.5g of distilled through it removing all possible metal flakes. By the end it showed no debris on the coffee filters that I poured the last gallon into. 

Didn’t want to spend more on fans, feet, or anything since this was a damaged thing and not really necessary so I rigged up some spare 200mm fans and a shroud off of my AC 1260mm.

Working great :) so this dumb build now has a 1260mm XT45, 1080mm XT45, 1080mm UT60, and then 320+240mm inside the case itself…

1lnxx75,https://www.reddit.com/r/confidence/comments/1lnxx75/advice_on_learning_how_to_set_boundaries_when/,Advice on learning How to Set Boundaries When Everyone in My Life is Used to Me Being a Doormat?,"TL;DR I don't know how to set boundaries in a way with people who's opinion about me, as in who I am as a person, is important to me, without being hostile, or offending them, or something along those lines. I also apparently give off some sort of cues subconsciously that attract people looking to take advantage of me. I need advice on how to confront this issue. 

I have realized more and more over the years that I have had a very unhealthy understanding of boundaries, been guilty of the nice guy mentality, and many other things. I think it all originates from how I was raised. My immediate family instilled a lot of these toxic traits into me when I was young to essentially manipulate, use, and control me. It was a very toxic environment I took into my social life as I grew. 

I have learned to stop being such a doormat with my family (they got very angry when I did this so I disowned them) and at the workplace. My life is a lot better regarding both those realms now, but I feel that the main reason I was successful was because I no longer care what anyone in my family and any of my coworkers think about me as a person. I do care what my coworkers think of me as a coworker, but that does not necessarily mean they see who I am as a person, if that makes any sense?

When it comes to the people I care about, my friends, my romantic interests, I am finding it much harder to set boundaries and remain liked and respected. Every woman I have dated in the last 5 years has ultimately used me in some way to some degree. I learned a while ago the difference between being nice and being kind, but I feel like like so many people who get some kindness from me one time get angry at me when I set a boundary the next time.

The last woman I dated took advantage big time. She had a lot of personal problems in her life in the 10 months we dated and I helped out when I could. However, when I had a major personal problem just this week, and I needed her to give me 15 minutes so I could get a cup of coffee and take my medication because I just woke up after a night of dealing with a crisis before I could call her and talk to her about her problems, that wasn't good enough. I asked for 15 minutes before I helped her again, not for help with my problems in return for all the help I gave her, just 15 minutes before I helped her again. I think that is a pretty light boundary. She didn't even say goodbye, just blocked my number and all my social media accounts mid conversation.

I guess I don't know how to set boundaries with people in a way that doesn't make me look like a jerk. That or I don't know how to find friends and lovers who have a modicum of respect for other people's boundaries. I seem to keep drawing people towards me who see me as someone they can exploit instead of people who actually like me for who I am. And I think it's down to my subconscious. I am a large, heavy set, man often clad in leather, spikes, and skulls, and yet everywhere I go people are always coming up to me and asking me for money. Of all the people the dust head could pick at the gas station they pick the big scary biker guy for some reason. And they are genuinely shocked when I tell them no, and to pound sand. Like they didn't expect that from me.

I must give off an aura. My upbringing must have left me with some kind of mannerisms or something that make me a target to manipulative people. I don't know how to keep them away without being incredibly hostile and I don't know how to attract actual semi-decent people into my life.

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula  
  
As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.  
  
Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.  
  
This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.  
  
What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.  
  
I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”  
  
So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.  
  
Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review  
  
When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.  
  
Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins  
  
The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.  
  
What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.  
  
Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.  
  


# [\>> Ready To See If Mitolyn Actually Delivers? Start Your Own 90-Day Test—Risk-Free.](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) ​

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress  
  
By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.  
  
Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.  
  
By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.  
  
Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.  
  
  
  
Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health  
  
Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.  
  
Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.  
  
My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.  
  
Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.

The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well  
  
Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: cellular energy is everything. The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.  
  
Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up  
  
The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.  
  
One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks. That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.  
  
Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization  
  
Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.  
  
Translation? Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.  
  
Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity  
  
Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the regeneration of mitochondrial DNA, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.  
  
Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores while on a Mitolyn-style stack.  
  
  
Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects  
  
Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.  
  
This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.

What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know  
  
Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around. These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.  
  
One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times. I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.  
  
Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.  
  
  
  
Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.  
  
I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.  
  
One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly. Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.  
  
Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.  
  
The truth is, Mitolyn overdelivered. I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.

Pros and Cons of Mitolyn – An Honest Snapshot  
  
I’ve now spent 90 days with Mitolyn. I’ve felt its highs and noted its tiny drawbacks. If you're wondering whether it's for you, here’s my honest take.  
  
Let’s start with the pros. The most obvious win is daily energy. Mitolyn doesn’t hype you up like caffeine—it smooths out your entire day. There’s no crash, no jitters, just steady fuel that makes you more productive, alert, and clear-headed. For someone juggling work and life, this is a game-changer.  
  
Another massive pro? The science-backed formulation. You can tell this isn’t some slapped-together supplement with fluff ingredients. Mitolyn zeroes in on mitochondrial support, metabolism, and inflammation in a way that’s focused and deliberate. It targets root causes, not just symptoms. I appreciated knowing every capsule was doing serious internal work, even when I didn’t “feel” it right away.  
  
There’s also trust built into the brand—which matters. Everything from how the website explains the sourcing to how they handle customer service screams integrity. Plus, the transparent return policy and lack of shady upsells gave me peace of mind.

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.  
  
Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins  
  
The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.  
  
What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.  
  
Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress  
  
By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.  
  
Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.  
  
By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.  
  
Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.  
  
  
  
Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health  
  
Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.  
  
Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.  
  
My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.  
  
Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.

The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well  
  
Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: cellular energy is everything. The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.  
  
Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up  
  
The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.  
  
One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks. That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.  
  
Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization  
  
Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.  
  
Translation? Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.  
  
Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity  
  
Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the regeneration of mitochondrial DNA, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.  
  
Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores while on a Mitolyn-style stack.  
  
  
Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects  
  
Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.  
  
This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.

What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know  
  
Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around. These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.  
  
One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times. I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.  
  
Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.  
  
  
  
Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.  
  
I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.  
  
One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly. Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.  
  
Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.  
  
The truth is, Mitolyn overdelivered. I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.

Pros and Cons of Mitolyn – An Honest Snapshot  
  
I’ve now spent 90 days with Mitolyn. I’ve felt its highs and noted its tiny drawbacks. If you're wondering whether it's for you, here’s my honest take.  
  
Let’s start with the pros. The most obvious win is daily energy. Mitolyn doesn’t hype you up like caffeine—it smooths out your entire day. There’s no crash, no jitters, just steady fuel that makes you more productive, alert, and clear-headed. For someone juggling work and life, this is a game-changer.  
  
Another massive pro? The science-backed formulation. You can tell this isn’t some slapped-together supplement with fluff ingredients. Mitolyn zeroes in on mitochondrial support, metabolism, and inflammation in a way that’s focused and deliberate. It targets root causes, not just symptoms. I appreciated knowing every capsule was doing serious internal work, even when I didn’t “feel” it right away.  
  
There’s also trust built into the brand—which matters. Everything from how the website explains the sourcing to how they handle customer service screams integrity. Plus, the transparent return policy and lack of shady upsells gave me peace of mind.

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.  
  
So, I decided to go all in.  
  
I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.  
  
Here’s what happened…

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula  
  
As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.  
  
Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.  
  
This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.  
  
What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.  
  
I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”  
  
So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.  
  
Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?  
  
I was about to find out.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.  
  
Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.

The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well  
  
Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: cellular energy is everything. The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.  
  
Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up  
  
The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.  
  
One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks. That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.  
  
Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization  
  
Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.  
  
Translation? Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.  
  
Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity  
  
Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the regeneration of mitochondrial DNA, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.  
  
Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores while on a Mitolyn-style stack.  
  
  
Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects  
  
Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.  
  
This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.

What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know  
  
Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around. These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.  
  
One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times. I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.  
  
Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.  
  
  
  
Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.  
  
I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.  
  
One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly. Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.  
  
Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.  
  
The truth is, Mitolyn overdelivered. I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.

Pros and Cons of Mitolyn – An Honest Snapshot  
  
I’ve now spent 90 days with Mitolyn. I’ve felt its highs and noted its tiny drawbacks. If you're wondering whether it's for you, here’s my honest take.  
  
Let’s start with the pros. The most obvious win is daily energy. Mitolyn doesn’t hype you up like caffeine—it smooths out your entire day. There’s no crash, no jitters, just steady fuel that makes you more productive, alert, and clear-headed. For someone juggling work and life, this is a game-changer.  
  
Another massive pro? The science-backed formulation. You can tell this isn’t some slapped-together supplement with fluff ingredients. Mitolyn zeroes in on mitochondrial support, metabolism, and inflammation in a way that’s focused and deliberate. It targets root causes, not just symptoms. I appreciated knowing every capsule was doing serious internal work, even when I didn’t “feel” it right away.  
  
There’s also trust built into the brand—which matters. Everything from how the website explains the sourcing to how they handle customer service screams integrity. Plus, the transparent return policy and lack of shady upsells gave me peace of mind.

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.  
  
So, I decided to go all in.  
  
I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula  
  
As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.  
  
Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.  
  
This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.  
  
What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.  
  
I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”  
  
So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.  
  
Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?  
  
I was about to find out.

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review  
  
When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.  
  
Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins  
  
The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.  
  
What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.  
  
Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.  
  


# [\>> Ready To See If Mitolyn Actually Delivers? Start Your Own 90-Day Test—Risk-Free.](https://44583er2h0iibv4enms64m5ley.hop.clickbank.net/) ​

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress  
  
By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.  
  
Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.  
  
By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.  
  
Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.  
  
  
  
Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health  
  
Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.  
  
Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well  
  
Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: cellular energy is everything. The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.  
  
Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up  
  
The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.  
  
One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks. That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.  
  
Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization  
  
Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.

Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects  
  
Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.  
  
This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.

What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know  
  
Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around. These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.  
  
One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times. I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.  
  
Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.  
  
  
  
Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.  
  
I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.  
  
One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly. Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.  
  
Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.  
  
The truth is, Mitolyn overdelivered. I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.

Pros and Cons of Mitolyn – An Honest Snapshot  
  
I’ve now spent 90 days with Mitolyn. I’ve felt its highs and noted its tiny drawbacks. If you're wondering whether it's for you, here’s my honest take.  
  
Let’s start with the pros. The most obvious win is daily energy. Mitolyn doesn’t hype you up like caffeine—it smooths out your entire day. There’s no crash, no jitters, just steady fuel that makes you more productive, alert, and clear-headed. For someone juggling work and life, this is a game-changer.  
  
Another massive pro? The science-backed formulation. You can tell this isn’t some slapped-together supplement with fluff ingredients. Mitolyn zeroes in on mitochondrial support, metabolism, and inflammation in a way that’s focused and deliberate. It targets root causes, not just symptoms. I appreciated knowing every capsule was doing serious internal work, even when I didn’t “feel” it right away.  
  
There’s also trust built into the brand—which matters. Everything from how the website explains the sourcing to how they handle customer service screams integrity. Plus, the transparent return policy and lack of shady upsells gave me peace of mind.

I used to drink tea on a daily basis, and loved having a beer or an old fashioned on the occasional evening off work, but haven’t had either since my first ER visit due to impaction out of an abundance of caution.

1lnxst3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Finches/comments/1lnxst3/i_need_to_unload/,I need to unload,"My wife adopted two wonderful Australian zebra finches last year. They are so amazing. I can watch them do what they do for hours and never get bored. I've come to love them. We have an open house policy when it comes to birds. We also have a 12-year-old military macaw who is mostly my pet. We take every precaution. But it's almost never enough. Today, my wife and her son went to see her friend across town. I woke up late and I wasn't even fully awake when I took them to her friends house. When I got back, I felt secure in the idea that she had said everything up for the finches, as usual. They have plenty of things to play on and they fly all around our downstairs area. They don't come upstairs because we keep the stairway and hall lights off. Everything is always finch-proofed. The sink in the kitchen is always empty, and the drains have stoppers in them. The only open water is there bird bath which is about an inch deep. What I didn't realize was that her 14-year-old son had taken a 8-in tall coffee cup and filled up the finches water with it.So when I got back from taking them to my wife's friend's house, I didn't realize that he had left the half a cup of water sitting on the TV stand. I picked up my macaw and carried his perch upstairs with me where I have a hobby bench that I work at when I am not otherwise engaged. We hung out up there, watching criminal minds and working on my 3D printer. About 2:00 in the afternoon, I heard the finches going crazy, but that is fairly normal. They sit in the front window, where it's warm, and yell at the outside birds non-stop. But an hour later I went downstairs. I had the macaw and his perch with me. I was just going to take out the trash and get things ready for when I went to pick them up. But when I got downstairs, the male finch, Sir David Attenbird, came flying right at me. He was yelling at me and I didn't know why. That's when I realized, I didn't see his partner, Dame Judy Finch. I put our macaw, Oscar, on his purge and I began to look. I looked in the sink, in their normal hiding places, in their night cage, etc. Then I looked David in the eye and said, ""Where is Judy?"" He got flustered and flew towards the TV stand and landed right next to a cup. I went over that way and looked all over. And then I had a terrible thought. I peeked into the cup, and there she was. Floating, not moving. Completely soaked. I freaked out and fell to my knees with the cup in my hands. I poured it out on the floor and she came with it. I picked her up and held her and she was cold and limp. Tears came to my eyes, and I began bawling. I held her close to me. That's when something came over me. I took a course at a local exotic bird store, on parrot CPR. And I remember the video I saw of a pool cleaning guy who rescued a ground squirrel from drowning. I placed her over the knuckle in my hand and began to rub her back. Water came out. It was an exercise in futility, so I thought. She didn't do anything. She just lay cold and limp. And I held her to my face and cried over her. That's what I felt something in my hand. She moved, very slightly, but she moved. So I laid her down and make sure her head was back and put my mouth over her beak and nose. I gave her three tiny breaths and kept massaging her back. I kept this up and all of a sudden she started to move more. I kept the holding her and, when I wasn't giving her breaths, I was breathing on her to get her warmer. She started to make little tiny noises. And I put her in my shirt and pulled it up over my mouth and nose to breathe warm air on her. And she started making more noises. And she started to move more. I pressed the button to call my wife on my phone, and I put it on speaker so that I could keep attending to her. All the while, David, the other Finch, sat nearby watching. She got dryer, and warmer, and as that happened, she got more animated. When my wife answered the phone, I told her that she needed to get home right away and within 10 minutes they were back. When they got back, my wife took over keeping her warm and I ran to get a heating pad. We kept her warm. And helped her to dry out. And within another hour, she was fussing and flitting about. I still couldn't let her go though. I brought David over to look at her and he watched very carefully. He was really concerned. And within another half hour, she was all dried out. She was tired, but she was herself. She was alive. She ate some food. And she sat on her window perch. And, she and David fed each other. But for some reason I just cannot get the image of that poor baby in the cup, out of my head. I'm so happy she's okay. But I can't get past the feeling when I first saw her. So helpless. And how another Finch showed me where she was and asked for help. I guess, all this is just to say, the littlest things, can have the most impact on us. She is sleeping quietly. Resting, cuddled up next to David. My wife's son is so upset that he forgot about that cup. He immediately said that it was all his fault and I had to tell him that he can't blame himself. I just wish our little pets didn't constantly try to end their own lives. Maybe this can help somebody.

He's financially trapped, forced to pay most bills while they exploit and mistreat him emotionally and physically. His mother insults his body, ruins his belongings, and disregards boundaries, while his brother enables and joins in the abuse. He has no savings and no way to move out without help, but refuses to let you fund his escape. You're heartbroken watching him suffer and want to know how to support him or help him leave.

Hey everyone, I've never really posted anything like this on reddit and it's a pretty emotionally charged topic for me, so I apologize if some of this seems like rambling! I used ChatGPT to make a little summary at the top for those not wanting to dive into the darker specifics of this.

My partner is 30 and lives with his mother, an unemployed narcissist who can't even hold a job due to the pure delusional attidude she seems to put out everywhere and anywhere, and his brother who is a 21 year old university student (who is seems to recieve none of this treament or abuse at all). His mother immigrated directly from Mexico, and had her own troubles while he was growing up including them living directly out of a car at times. From what she describes, his father was just as tired as he was with her garbage - but he could leave, easily.

We're long distance, or i'd just physically move him out to get him out of there and together we'd be safe from them. But I can't, and I can't fund setting up his own apartment myself (and he would most likely not let me lol). Dropping them and never looking back is not the problem, its getting him out and away from them at all so he can finally grow. He is smart, talented, kind hearted and just generally a sweet person, despite all of this shit happening behind the scenes. He is one to take it out on himself, rather than me or his friends.

Due to his mother's narcissistic parenting and being forced to pay large portions of household bills for fear of being kicked out completely (alongside the favorite child, his younger brother, who pays a very small ammount), he has literally no savings anymore and any money that is saved goes directly into his bills. All of his payments for everything are behind, because he covers for her portion of the bills as well as his own. 

She and his brother regularily eat any and all food he buys for himself (even if its all he has for the entire week worth of lunches or food they don't even like), uses his household items he buys for himself, breaks his stuff and rifles through his room when he is at work. She recently left his brand new French Press on the table/counter for so long with used coffee in it that maggots had started growing in it. It's now completely unusable, rotten and stained. Not only was it his, but one the first birthday presents he's ever bought himself and was just purchased in March.  

She often directly insults him and his body since he is a larger guy, calling him a gorilla, poking at his stomach or comparing him to a monster despite very obviously seeing that he misses meals, barely eats and is constantly trying to eat healthy to lose weight. The dude only drinks a nasty green smoothie for breakfast everyday, and was regularily working out when he had money for a gym membership. She can never be in the wrong, even with written factual proof - he thinks even if he filmed he she would still find a way to shift the blame to him. She has thrown things at him, given him presents that are just boxes full of trash, sometimes just coming into his room to tell him he looks like shit.

His brother is no better, simply going along with everything Mom does while also living the good life. She does all his laundry and folds it, cleans his room, drives him anywhere and also makes meals for the two of them only, not my partner. He jumps in on any rag session agains my partner, adding in whatever and making it worse. There is rare moments he gains some semblance of kindness for my partner, but it only lasts for a few moments.

It breaks my heart to see him having to endure stuff like this daily, and I am helpless in doing anything besides comforting him, and reminding him that our future will be better and nothing like this will ever happen again. 

How can I help him out of this? I appreciate any feedback just dealing with them in general, anything I can do to make my partner's life even a little bit easier. I've personally never dealt with a narcissist, especially this long term and physically/mentally abusive, so I am completely out of my element in trying to make anything better.",1,1751255094.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

We’re from the PNW so we will be on the hunt for a good coffee every morning. Favorite coffee shop/breakfast spot? 

He loves good food, so I know we’ll be in the right place, but where would you say is the place that does not miss? More specifically, a great seafood spot?

He’s also big into Jazz, so I’m hoping the music life is still alive mid-November. Which Jazz spot do you love? 

And finally, the touristy stuff, hit or miss, and if it’s a hit, where to book through- 

-Ghost Tours 
-Gator/Swamp tours 
-Beignet shops
-Voodoo stores 


Thanks for any and all input! If there’s anything I’m missing or need to see, I’d love suggestions. In our 11 years together we’ve never been somewhere longer than over night, or on a plane together. I’m really excited for this time with him and want to plan it right!

1lnxko0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1lnxko0/single_mom_survival_tips/,Single Mom Survival Tips,"My baby just turned 1, and I wanted to share some tips (and a little bit of my story) for new or expecting single moms. This journey has been the hardest thing I’ve ever done and also the most rewarding. I’m 41 now, had my baby at 40 (pregnant at 39), and I have no regrets about leaving my old life behind. I truly love being a mom. Honestly, if I could afford it, I’d be a SAHM. Taking care of my baby and my home is something I truly enjoy.

But I don’t have that option. Doing this alone is hard. I’m lucky to have a good support system—my parents, sisters, friends, and even people at work—but it’s not the same as having someone else in the house who shares the daily responsibility. Sometimes I hear moms complain about their husbands not pulling their weight, and all I can think is… I’d settle for just a “decent” dad showing up once in a while so I could rest. :(

***Before baby arrives, setup your space

If you’re still pregnant, try to plan ahead. Set up systems. Label everything. Organize your home in a way that makes sense not just for you, but for anyone who might come help. I had a couple of “pro mom” friends come over when my baby was tiny, and they were speechless because I had everything so dialed in. Think of it like a “McDonald’s burger assembly line”. I’m not joking! 🙃 

Once everything is in place, say yes to help. Whether it’s childcare, cleaning, cooking, or even money, say yes. Show your helpers where things are, give them a quick rundown, and go lie down. You need the break.

***Make your life easier 

If you can swing it financially (even through credit or payment plans), buy the gadgets and gear that make daily life easier. I live in a two-story house, and I knew I’d be upstairs a lot with the baby, so I got a water filter like a Berkey to avoid lugging water up the stairs.

Here are a few other things I’m so glad I had:
	•	Mini fridge upstairs for milk and snacks
	•	Bottle warmer
	•	Baby Brezza (a hand-me-down and so worth it!)
	•	Momcozy countertop dishwasher
	•	Step stool with a handle for post-c-section mobility

Yes, I took on some debt buying all the gadgets (there are MANY more!). No, I don’t regret it. Mental health matters. I’ll deal with the debt later. Right now it’s survival mode.

***Sleep

At first, I was against sleep training. I had a unicorn baby who slept through the night by two months. But at six months, everything changed. She started waking up constantly, and I had no one to share night duty with. I needed rest so I could function at work. I researched different methods, made a plan that felt right for baby and I, and by the end of the first week, she was sleeping again.

I also bought the Owlet sock. It let me sleep without constantly checking if she was breathing. If you’re an anxious mom like me, it’s worth every penny.

***Tracking apps

Some moms say tracking drove them nuts. If that’s you, skip it. But I personally loved it, especially during the newborn stage. I used the Huckleberry app to keep track of naps, feedings, medicine, everything. It took a load off my mind. Once she hit six months, I stopped. But when she and I both got the flu, I started again temporarily. It helped me keep track when my brain was too foggy to remember anything.

***Entertaining baby

Some moms feel bored and stuck. I get it. My baby needed constant variety, so I invested in toys and rotated them out often. I also developed a baby book addiction (I used to be obsessed with cookbooks!).

Read to your baby, even if it feels like they’re not paying attention. They are. My baby’s second word (after mama) was “book.” I also used baby carriers a lot—I’d strap her on and go make coffee, cook, dance, or step outside for fresh air. Narrate your actions as you go. They’re always listening. Sing to your baby! I used to sing (school competitions) when I was in middle school and lost my ability to sing after so many years of no longer singing. I swear singing to my baby has improved my singing. 😆 I’m on tune again and voice is no longer trembly. Yay! Lol 

***Yes, I used “containers”

I needed safe places to put my baby down. I had rockers, bouncers, play yards, a crib, a bassinet, everything. And I used them all. (Skip Hop activity center saved my life! 😅) I showered every day (while she was on a bouncer), even if she cried through it. She got used to it. I had safe “baby stations” in every part of the house so I could move around and function. If your baby likes car rides, use that too. I’d go buy a Coke Zero and go to Target to get diapers and formula delivered to the car. It felt like “I went out”. 😂

***Childcare costs

My mom initially offered free childcare, but her wrist gave out and she had to back out. I couldn’t afford daycare and didn’t qualify for assistance, even though I don’t make much (I made enough for myself but not enough for me and a baby). Thankfully, people who love me stepped up. My dad and I split three days of childcare, a friend covers another day, and I work the fifth day from home. 

My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in December. He’s doing better, but it breaks my heart knowing he might not be around long, and I don’t know how I’ll afford childcare without him. It’s terrifying and I feel a lot of guilt that he’s getting chemo and working extra just to help me afford my baby’s childcare. I kid you not, but he loves doing this for my baby, even if he feels physically terrible. (He’s a macho man, and loves to show that he can do anything despite being sick.) But yeah… I want him to stop. Which leads me to the next topic… But before I do, I want to say childcare has been amazing and baby is doing great! As a single mom, going back to work felt great. I didn’t shed a tear when my maternity leave ended 😅, but in all fairness, I have a babysitter that comes to my house, so I don’t have to drop her off anywhere. I think that helped me “let go” a little and start working again without the guilt of leaving my baby in a strange place. At 18 months, I have another plan for childcare so she can socialize with other kids. It should be cheaper too. 8 months to go!

***Child support

This is a personal decision. If your child’s father is dangerous, I’d understand skipping it completely. But in my case, he’s just selfish and absent. Because I needed help, I decided to pursue child support. I hired a lawyer last fall and the trial is finally around the corner. If money’s tight and the father has a job, go for it. If you can’t afford a lawyer, look into self-representing through the court. It’s not just about now—it’s about securing support for your child’s future. It took me a while to take action. I felt a lot of empathy for the dad but then one day I “woke up” and had enough. 

***Final thoughts

It’s you and Team Baby. That’s how I think of it. When things are hard, I remind myself that it’s even harder for her. I say it out loud: “It must be hard to be a baby.” “You’re not in my belly anymore—you have to cry for your food now. It’s okay. I’m here.” It helped me stay gentle and feel a lot of empathy for my baby when I was exhausted and felt like giving up (but I knew that I couldn’t!).

Everyone says it gets better. And you roll your eyes because you can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. But it does get better. The days feel endless, but the first year flies by. Take the pictures. Record the videos. Your baby won’t be tiny forever. I can barely cradle mine now. She squirms like a baby alligator when I try to change her diaper.

Hang in there. You’re not just surviving—you’re doing something incredible. And even if it doesn’t feel like it, you’re doing a great job. Your baby will see all your hard work and effort when they grow older. I know we’re not doing it and expecting a pat on the back from anyone, but it still feels good to know that we’re awesome. We are SO strong! 💪❤️

Clearing emails - somehow takes 30 mins to 1 hour. I have no idea how time even flies that fast, most mails are just brain-dead stuff with things that require simple research.

Morning Routine - how did it all get so complicated? You wake up, take a dump, shower...30 mins gone. 10 mins to dress and style. 5 mins to gather your stuff. 5-10 mins of checking any missed emails, messages, or Instagram stories. Wow, already an hour gone.

Eating - eating out takes around 45-60 mins due to ordering, consuming at a normal pace, walking back-and-forth etc. That's like another hour gone. And if you cook...also takes about an hour because of the washing, prepping etc. Double it if you are a normal person who eats at least twice a day.

THAT'S ALREADY 3.5 - 4 HOURS GONE!!

Then you factor in commute time, waiting in line for groceries & shopping...that's already on average, another 1- 1.5 hours wasted.

And you get buried with information DAILY!! 

Want to do a doctor's appointment? Gotta spend at least 30 mins googling for a good clinic, calling and scheduling an appointment, finding good transportation routes etc.

Want to go on vacation? HOURS of planning.

Want to cook a new meal? At least 30 mins of YouTube videos, reading, and blog posts.

Annual things like renewing your residence permit, or your insurance, or finding out new administrative news / procedures about your next academic semester? HOURS AND HOURS GONE JUST BY READING PROCEDURE OUTLINES

Want to gym and be healthy? Another hour gone. Want to relax and unwind with Netflix or games? Another hour or more gone. Want to learn a new hobby like a board game? Hours of learning.

Reading a textbook or academic paper? HOURS, sometimes DAYS. While it only took me like 2 hours in my youth to learn something new like a new biology / chemistry chapter (i know content is easier back in school / highschool, but our brains were also under developed, so it kinda even things out, yes?)

Like...how did Life get so complicated? When I was a teenager / kid, Life was pretty much school, food, sleep, study etc. In fact, sometimes days just felt so slow that you could spend time at the mall, going on coffee dates, exploring your city...heck, I remember completing video games in days. Now it takes MONTHS. I remember going to my local card shop and then the movies and then hanging out with friends.

These days I feel guilty for doing things in my youth.

How did time get so compressed? Am I getting mentally slower due to social media ruining my concentration span? Is information overload a new thing since the Internet was rather recent 10-20 years ago? Is it just a natural sensation, like how kids perceive time slower than adults?

1lnxix7,https://v.redd.it/4unmcwn5iz9f1,"""Jael: The Housewife Hit-Woman"" (Monday Morning Motivation)","It’s quiet. The kind of quiet that’s suspicious. The suspicious silence, like when your toddler suddenly disappears mid-Zoom meeting, or Congress promises “bipartisan cooperation.” I'm talking about an immediate cause for concern!

You can hear the breeze brushing the linen of the tent, the rhythmic breath of a sleeping man. A beast of a man who thought he was safe. His name is Sisera. He’s a warlord, a killer, the kind of guy who’d make Putin look like a preschooler. And right now, he’s knocked out on a cozy little blanket, in a woman’s tent, belly full of milk, snoring like my drunk uncle at Thanksgiving.



The assassin enters the tent, and has a fitting name. Jail. That’s right, Jail, as in, the place society sends it's murderous assassins to rot away! Except, Jail wasn't your typical cold-blooded killer, she was a housewife, and just a normal woman! Her name was spelled, J. A. E. L. And let's not sugarcoat it, this was one badass stay-at-home-wife! She didn't have a gun. No armor. No sword. No fancy military titles. Just a tent peg in one hand and a hammer in the other, walking toward this genocidal maniac like she was the ""John Wick of Guardian Angels"" . She kneels beside him, lines up the peg right above his temple, like she’s playing Biblical Whac-A-Mole. and bam! One clean shot. The razor-sharp Tent peg goes straight through his head, like an ice-pick through a watermelon, and right into the ground. And just like that, Israel wins the battle! because of a stay-at-home housewife decided she was tired of evil men thinking they were untouchable.



Now, before we give her a standing ovation, let’s pull back the curtain and ask: exactly, what the hell was going on?



This is in the book of Judges, chapter 4. Israel’s gone soft, again. surprise, surprise. They’d been delivered out of bondage, given land, law, and freedom. and still managed to fumble the bag, like a damn rookie wide-receiver with a ""diddy-amount"" of babyoil on his hands. So, God lets them get pressed by King Jabin, of Canaan. His general, Sisera, rolls deep with 900 iron chariots, which in those days was like showing up to a civil war reenactment in a modern war tank. Israel was broken, But this ain’t just a story about war. It’s about a nation that lost its testicular fortitude… and a woman who found it!



Now, let’s zoom out a little further.



Jail wasn’t even an Israelite. She was a Kenite, a tribe with ties to Moses’ in-laws. Her people had peace with the enemy. So technically, she didn’t have to do anything. She could’ve played neutral. She could’ve minded her own damn business, but let's face it. She just couldn't help herself. God was guiding her, with zero effs to give! Jael didn’t just reject neutrality, she weaponized her hospitality. Sisera came in asking for water, and she intentionally gave him warm milk. Probably pure goat milk, no lactose-free options in those days. He lays down, thinking he’s safe. maybe dreaming of slaughtering more innocent people, and just as he drifts off to la-la-land..... boom! Jail makes history.



Let’s pause and appreciate the finesse. She didn’t shout, scream or tweet about it. She didn’t need a conference, or a special sign from God. She didn’t even need a damn sword! She just knew what she had to do. She used what she had, and did what she needed to do, to get the job done. And that, my friends, is more revolutionary than half the nonsense we glorify today. She was the only person brave enough to slay Satan!





This is the part of the Bible your Sunday-school teacher skips. It's far Too violent. Too real. But guess what? Real faith ain’t supposed to be a scented candle, or a hot cup of Starbucks snuggled under a weighted blanket. Real faith has blood under its fingernails. Real faith isn’t afraid to kill comfort to protect what’s right. And isn't afraid to stand alone, if need be!



Now, I know what some of y’all are thinking: “Isn’t this a little too aggressive for Christianity?” No, I don't think so sunflower!

We tell the raw, authentic Story with an emphasis on integrity and strength. The same Jesus that said “turn the other cheek”, also flipped tables and made his own whip. It’s called righteous rage. And it’s been neutered out of the Church like a rescue dog at a vegan feminist commune.

Look around. The modern world’s begging you to kneel to everything but God. Every new alphabet acronym wants you to surrender your beliefs, for clout. For Pride. Pride isn’t a vibe, it’s a virus. It’s the OG sin, the one that got Lucifer kicked out of Heaven and turned paradise into a war zone. Pride convinces you that you don’t need help, don’t need God, and don’t need truth. just your own inflated ego and a ring light. It masquerades as confidence, but it’s really a cancer of the soul. It makes you unteachable, ungrateful, and eventually… unrecognizable. Pride doesn’t build you up, it blinds you. And by the time you realize it’s destroyed you, it’s already burned down everything around you. So yeah, it’s not just a deadly sin, it’s the deadliest. Kill it before it kills you. Just look around, Every screen flashes fear. Every politician lies through veneers so white, they blind satellites. Meanwhile, churches are hiring marketing consultants and launching sermon series with Drag Queen Story Time. It’s a clown show. It's no wonder men are confused and women are exhausted.



Jael didn’t wait for a tougher husband, or a bigger crew to have her back. She didn’t post a prayer meme, or repost a TikTok video. She put a damn spike through the problem. And you, the listener. you’ve got problems. Real ones. we all do. We all go through it. Marriages that feel like cold war treaties. Debt, that’s growing like mold in a New Orleans apartment. Sins, you’ve fed so long, they’ve developed multiple personalities. But don’t you dare tell me you can’t handle it. Don’t you dare say “God will take care of it”, like it’s a get-out-of-action-free card. Sometimes, God does the work… through you. You don't get to sit out, or refuse to exhaust your efforts. You need to act. Act with purpose, with integrity, and with dedication. Some of the most pressing issues, require swift, decisive action.



Maybe your genocidal savage is discipline. Maybe it’s self-education. Maybe it’s raising your kids like their souls matter more than their soccer trophies. Maybe it’s having one awkward but truthful conversation that cuts through the fog, like a chainsaw in a pillow factory. But whatever it is, grab that tent peg, sharpen it. Swing it. Use it. Because the enemy ain’t sleeping forever. And Evil never rests.



 Don’t get it twisted, this story isn’t about glorifying violence. It’s about clarity. It's about finding  the courage to do what’s necessary, when everyone else is praying someone else steps up. You want revival? It won’t come from a YouTube algorithm. It’ll come from people like Jael. And People like you!



So if you’re listening to this on your way to a dead-end job, or while sipping black coffee with a mind full of bitterness, hear me when I say. This week, be Jael. Don’t be Sisera. Don’t be neutral. Don’t be numb. Don't be a tyrant. But Be dangerous, for the right reasons. God doesn’t need more followers. He needs warriors.



And I end this with a plead to you all to always remember, Jesus didn’t tap out, and neither will we! In a world where enemies walk in your tent thinking they’re safe, we sharpen our tent pegs, offer the milk… and drive the truth straight through the lies.

1lnxgdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1lnxgdg/looking_back_on_twenty_years_of_early_retirement/,Looking back on twenty years of early retirement.,"The twentieth anniversary of my early retirement’s coming up on July fifteenth, and I’ve been asked for retrospection & introspection. Well...gather ‘round, children, and let Father Time regale you with the wisdom of the ages, or at least whatever senile fuckery pops into his grizzled old head. 

I'm fifty-six now, and I hate admitting that the touch of grey is becoming more than a touch. But as I’ve gotten older my views and lifestyle have become simpler rather than more complicated, which is nice. And while I’m WAAAAAAAAY underqualified to get into the technical complexities of the FIRE process, thirteen years of working towards FIRE and twenty years of living it have given me time to work out a bit of philosophy.

Or maybe I'm just talking bullshit. 

Either way, feel free to ask questions and/or challenge me and/or fart in my general direction, but know that I travel for extended periods of time and I’m about to hit the road for a few months. May or may not get back to you. Perhaps that’s for the best.

Here goes.

——

The E=MC^(2) of FIRE is: “Work towards having something to sell besides your time.” You can derive everything else from that statement. 

——

You need a strong vision for your post-career life. People who say, “I can’t imagine what I’d do if I retired,” probably won’t.

——

It’s FAR better to move towards something positive than away from something negative.

Although here’s as good a motivation to work towards FIRE as any: you’ll get to shop for groceries on Tuesday mornings when there’s nobody there and the produce trucks have just hit the store.

——

Money is the wrench, not the machine.

It can’t buy you happiness, but it CAN buy you more time to find it. That said, you don’t need to be rich & retired to do so. I see too many people treating FIRE like a glorified geographical cure, as in: “If I could only quit my job I’d be happy.” But we know how that works: you carry your problems wherever you go.

So what if you worked on your personal issues as much as you work on your FIRE plan? Is it possible you could find contentment in your present situation? Would you still need to quit to be happy?

——

Back in the day I rarely discussed my FIRE plan. I learned that the hard way from a couple of family members who gave me the whole flabbergasted “Mark my words: you’ll be living under a highway overpass someday!” schtick. Meaning FIRE is risky. But risky as compared to what? The risk of shoving pixels across a desk for forty years?

Fuck all that. I’ve never felt more at risk than when I was working in corporate America.

——

It takes a lot of self-discipline to make FIRE happen, which most people seem capable of, but you have to be careful about it. For instance, I put a shit-ton of pressure on my ex to save money, too much, and it permanently damaged our relationship.

——

Which: know that it’s possible to navigate a divorce without jeopardizing your FIRE status. We split everything up the middle and walked away with friendship and respect and—most importantly—our (adult) daughter’s love for us intact.

Neither of us have returned to work.

——

If you’re new to the idea of FIRE, understand that your FIRE/life balance can be as tricky, or trickier, than your work/life balance.

If you go all-in for it, you’ll be making big changes in your life, not all of which are comfortable. The pursuit of FIRE can mean you’ll be socializing less—a dirty martini is like seventeen bucks in my hometown now—so your relationships may suffer. You’ll be downsizing your vacations, you’ll be working harder and chasing promotions from company to company, you’ll be considering geographical arbitrage a lot more seriously, etc. etc. etc. It piles on. 

——

Ego death is a thing. As I’ve said before:

It's easy to confuse your career with your identity. In the US, at least, we tend to introduce ourselves to strangers with what we do for a living rather than who we are in life. “I consult for a company that sells golf ball dimples” rather than “I’m a swordfighter in the Society for Creative Anachronism.”

So when you reach FIRE and you wad up your career and toss it over your shoulder, you’re probably tossing a good bit of your self-identity with it. But the question’ll soon arise: NOW who am I?

——

Don’t buy into the bullshit that you’re not retired if you earn a little money at something, especially a hobby. The work ethic that enables people to FIRE doesn’t vanish the instant they quit. And besides, none of us are entitled to judge each other's standards of retirement. An ye harm none, do what ye will.

——

You want to talk about LeanFIRE: there used to be a guy named Daniel Suelo who lived in a cave outside Moab, UT and lived mostly on the societal waste stream. He didn’t handle money in any form for something like fifteen years. I thought he was just as retired as I was—unconventionally, true, but he’d figured out a way to avoid employment while keeping body and soul together AND living in accordance with what seemed like reasonable ethical principles, such as, “Reduce/reuse/recycle,” and “Don’t desecrate your soul.” He got criticized for freeloading library internet connections at the expense of taxpayers, but there are greater sins.

——

IME to maximize both your enjoyment of FIRE and of life in general, you’ve gotta get out there and struggle. Don’t stagnate. I have occasionally, and it sucks.

——

Exercise and eat healthy, man, because there’s a lot of fun to be had in the world, and you’re just the person to have it. 

——

You’ve also gotta maintain your mental acuity. Do complicated intellectual-type shit, even if it’s no more than playing a difficult video game.

——

On gaming: I get why people might think it’s a waste of time. BUT: one of my main social outlets is playing Fortnite, God help me, with a group of my good friends who are scattered around the country. We do this late nights two or three times a week. I’d rather be playing anything else, like Jamming Bamboo Splinters Under My Toenails Simulator, but this is how my buddies and I keep in touch. Otherwise our relationships would’ve fizzled out years ago.

——

After I got divorced I built out a Sprinter van and hit the road for a couple of years. It was fun and I was surprised by how economical the lifestyle was. But I finally roosted, and when I did, I splurged on an expensive apartment. It has a great view, great amenities, and sits in a coveted location. 

I also bought, which seems preposterous, a $200 coffee machine. I drink coffee all day long and I want it to taste like something. And there’s no way I’m gonna be able to operate an Aeropress when I’m barely awake enough to remember where the kitchen is.

It was SO hard to splurge on myself. I’ve been scrimping my way through life ever since I was in my mid-twenties because of my FIRE plan, goddammit, and it took a HUGE mental/emotional effort to break through my thriftiness and spend money on stuff that was “frivolous.”

Don't be like that. It's OK to treat yourself occasionally.

——

For those who might be curious, my finances are pretty dull. As of this writing I'm worth about—

Well, fuck. I'm worth about $4.39 a pound if you grind me into hamburger, but I hate that phrase, ""I'm worth."" I'm worth a hell of a lot more than that, and a hell of a lot less, depending on who you ask.

Anyway, here's where I was going. I own about $2.4 million in financial assets as of this writing, a Sprinter van worth maybe $50K, and no real estate. Pay the credit card off monthly. I live on around 2.5% of my financial assets per year--not the 3% that I quoted off the top of my head elsewhere. I've moved away from a mix of individual equities and index funds and diversified into target retirement date funds at Vanguard, laddered in five-year increments. That's not fully efficient, which I need to work on.

But yeah, my finances are dull. Dull is key.

——

In conclusion:

As I said, I just turned fifty-six, and you know something funny about that? 

When you’re thirty-six and tell people you’re retired, they think: unicorn. But when you’re fifty-six and tell people you’re retired, they think: meh. Might still be a bit young to make an exit, but you’re no longer a mythical beast…you’re just an ordinary dude in the post-career phase of his life. Plenty like you out there. Don’t feel special.

And I don't.

1lnxbx8,https://i.redd.it/zrcbshurfz9f1.png,Donate More by Donating Less,"
I know this was already posted this week, but I feel I should clarify what's going on here.

If you're a GNOME user, GNOME needs your help. The past few years have been financially difficult for the GNOME Foundation. The last year in particular has been really challenging. We have re-launched our donation page with an explicit focus on recurring donations:

[https://donate.gnome.org](https://donate.gnome.org)

Historically, almost all GNOME donations came from *maintainers*, not users. That's not just nuts... it's totally broken. Many of these folks grind 80 hour weeks, for years. Many of them are volunteers. They shouldn't be the ones *giving* the Foundation money, they should be the ones *being paid* by the Foundation (in the form of grants, contracts, etc). I argued to the GNOME Foundation Board this month that our revenue model was inside-out. They agreed.

In the near-term, we just need to make sure GNOME stays afloat. The GNOME Foundation supplies all of GNOME's development infrastructure (including GitLab and CI/CD), manages all development grants/contracts, runs Flathub, runs GUADEC, manages internship financing, and supplies travel grants for contributors. It would really suck if the wheels fell off ... because all of this matters.

But in the medium-term, the goal is for the Foundation to use recurring donations to really grow GNOME and push development harder than ever before. I want to see us absolutely crush the proprietary desktops and then win the mobile market. For that, the ""medium-term"" needs to happen sooner than later. That's why I'm so focused on recurring donations in this post:

[https://blogs.gnome.org/steven/2025/06/26/donate-less/](https://blogs.gnome.org/steven/2025/06/26/donate-less/)

Additionally, I want to be very clear that I'm being entirely sincere when I say ""donate less."" Donate with a floor, not a ceiling. Keep the number as low as makes sense for you. Because the goal is longevity, not single big donations, we really need you to donate a value that's trivial to you: the price of a coffee, the price of a frivolous meal out that you wouldn't think twice about buying. That sort of thing. Don't jeopardize your own financial comfort for ours — GNOME has millions of users who can potentially donate if you can't. We just need to reach them. (You can help us by pointing people to this post.)

Hope that clears things up! Feel free to ask questions if it doesn't.

I guess I am making this post for people on the fence.... It's right at the cusp of being a great handheld, but I've tinkered with it more than any other handhelds I own.
1. My LeGo came with a slow nvme ssd. Crystalmark tested that had a read and write of 2800MB/s. Sources said 5000MB/s. Bought a 2280 2tb with converter. Converter didn't work. Returned both and got a 2230. This thing uses a 2242.... I kicked myself for not researching more. Now has a 2230 2tb with electrical tape to keep it down.
2. Installed bazzite, then back to windows, then cachyos. Stuck with cachyos. But now thinking I want windows again because of Lossless Scaling on steam that only works on windows. On a side note, it feels like the LeGo was meant for steam OS. I was running Tekken 8 at a choppy 25 fps on Windows and now get 45 and some times 60 fps on SteamOS. A much better experience on SteamOS which leads me to ...
3. Not all my games work at full resolution with a decent fps which the LeGo has such a beautiful screen but it's hardware just doesn't match it. 
4.  Battery. 1 hour and 20min on vampire survivors and I am at 15 percent. Whoa. Screen is eating my battery life. An upgraded battery is sitting in my amazon basket.... But why buy it?
5. Emulation. Another reason why I have considered going back to windows even though steamos plays my steam games significantly better. The LeGo plays everything up to PS3 decently well but I feel I am transferring ISOs and doing most of my other emulation converting tasks on my windows PC. 

After all this... I keep coming back. My ally x plays all my games perfectly but5 the LeGo has a pretty 1440p screen that keeps me coming back. Which leads me back to the battery and why I don't want to buy the upgraded battery. I would never travel with this thing as all my business flights are really long, it's big, bulky and I am not sure if the upgrade would suffice. My ally x has outlasted my LeGo by a landslide. Yet, sitting on my couch, plugged in, kick standed on a small coffee table and removable controllers this thing is great! I think that's where is thing shines. At home, on the couch, or on your toilet.

Trying to find a new Dr here so I can get in to get routine lab/blood work done has been tough. With my insurance it's difficult finding anybody who's local and not booked up. 

I know nobody can say for sure in here what state my liver is at. But I guess im looking to see how often Doctors see patients at my age who are past the point of healing their liver.

I try to eat and drink a good amount of liver healthy things otherwise. I pretty much just drink black coffee and lemon water. I don't have sugar much.  When I drink it's usually white claw or clear liquor mixed with seltzer and lime. I eat Ginger and turmeric,olive oil,beets,avocados,etc.

Your help is greatly appreciated.,"I'll apologize ahead of time, there's a lengthy bit of fluff in this post, but feel free to skip straight to the question.

I turned 30 this month and I've been doing some reflecting on life in various ways thus far, one being my finances, it's effect on my overall wellbeing, and my mismanagement of this aspect of my life.

-Reflection-

I've work in some sort of management position since I was 17, starting off in the workforce at a restaurant as a manager making 60k-70k a year, depending on the bonus structures that year, with nearly no liabilities at the time. In this time period of my life I wasn't as concerned with my own finances however within my first year of management, at 18, I was able to funnel 1.5 million dollars to the bottom line of one restaurant.

Needless to say I became a very popular topic for the district managers and eventually made my way to the ear of corporate, with the CEO coming by on one occasion to bring his children to get a milkshake personally from the kid that's made him loads of money and worked hard doing so. Looking back it was like I was an animal at the zoo, wow look at the stripes on this donkey, but at the time I was honored to have the CEO come visit my location personally.

My growth slowed at the store, but continued to hold steady. Corporate had decided that I'd be best suited to be spread across the district to other stores in our state, however I didn't receive a promotion to District manager, I guess they feared I was too young, 20 at this point. Instead, I continued to run my store and I was pulled off of salary and given a percentage of bonuses from the stores that I helped develop, 5 stores total.

At this point, I had more money I knew what to do with, but for four years I worked 90+ hours every week consistently. I lived off modafinil, coffee and chasing numbers, but damn I was a rock star. Eventually with the death of someone I considered to be an important father figure in my life, he died at work with his family at home, and I cracked.

I turned in my notice and quit. I was at 24 making 6 figures, no friends, failing relationships, physically shrilved from barely eating, and mentally exhausted.

Living off my savings, I took a year off work. I got back into the gym, spent some time at several occasions at my now ex's family beach house and  spent that year in reflection. For me it was a pivitol moment of my life where I realized I personally lacked balance. I tend to go all in or not at all.

Now here I am at 30 working at a energy storage manufacturing company as a production supervisor making 75k. I've placed some barriers up for myself to not allow my over work tendencies to kick back into high gear. Now I'm tired of working for someone else all together, but it's just not financially viable for me to give up this security at this time.

I find myself once again with that insatiable hunger to drive up some number, but this time my bottom line. I'd like to separate my need to work, focus my energy on other life endeavors and accelerate this investment process as quickly as possible.


-----Question-----

I'll be taking half of my income 50% (35k) each year to invest in high yeild dividends stocks and drip until I reach a livable income. 

With income as the primary focus, I'm looking at some high yeild monthly and weekly dividends to compound on as quickly as possible without having to manage as frequently.

I'm aware there's high risk involved, but I don't plan on cashing out anything other than the dividends once they reach say 40-50k.

Are there any suggestions on making this work effectively? 

Any ways of speeding this up demonstratably?

Has anyone ever gotten burned attempting this?

Help would be greatly appreciated.

Therefore concerned about my safety and the safety of my family, I decided to use my mobile phone as a dash cam in our car and body cam when walking or using public transportation to record these events taking place from early morning to late at night. 

On the Street 
They drive back and forth with the high beams lights on in my face wherever I’m parked, stall across the street, drive up slowly at the corner or alley and pull up to the side in view of my peripheral vision making U turns in an aggressive way, others walk by cross the street mocking and laughing loud enough for me to hear engaging in conversation about a certain topic that only I’m familiar with followed by indirect comments or stand at close proximity to where I am while others use the surrounding coffee shops and clothing stores to stare from inside. 

On the road
On the highway or city street this includes 
Going and coming back from work every night 
Multiple cars in the same make & models, color coordinated, tailgate from behind including bicycles, electric scooters and motorcycles suddenly cuts us off in front and then purposely driving slower, stopping unexpectedly, make right or left turns changing lanes without putting their turn signals on while others are already waiting in places where I go with my family, same color cars all in one place.  the devil is in the details there are some features I use to distinguish between them and innocent bystanders but wil
not disclose any details what they are, its no surprise they are reading this as I type it in real time. But they will try to cause confusion by blending in with the average public, with the objective to be the first to commit an illegal act of crime and confront someone who doesn’t have anything to do with this matter therefore look like the “crazy” one and them “witnesses” to this “incident” I didn’t fall for this scheme.

Ok, so after a big breakup I moved into a new neighbourhood, and started seeing this very attractive guy around at my local coffee shop. We both appeared to enjoy hanging out there and doing work. I thought I caught him looking at me a few times... maybe. One day, he was sitting next to me and he was working on his resume and I saw his name on his laptop. I went home and like any girl would do, looked him up online. I found his Linkedin profile where he uploads videos of educational podcasts he hosts and I LOVED his personality and the way he interacts with his guests, he seemed so nice and super intelligent! He's totally my type. 

My crush developed, and I resolved to speak to him next time I saw him, but a month passed before I saw him again, and when I did, I chickened out and we just made more eye contact. Now, another month has passed and I haven't seen him around at all. I'm trying to use Hinge to go on new dates, but none of these guys really interest me because I still have a big fat crush on AWOL coffee shop guy who I may never even see again. I did not think it would be appropriate to message him on Linkedin + expose that I creeped him. 

Please, people of reddit, slap some sense into me, I am becoming obsessed with a mystery man and spending way too much time at coffee shops hoping he'll turn up. Thank you. ",2,1751253310.0,relationship_advice,5,0.75,False

5 or 6 years ago, I matched with a girl in Bumble. We chatted, flirted, we had so many similar interests and I really thought she was cute. A bit femme, geeky and cute (my type). Sadly hindi consistent yung chats namin, sometimes I get busy in college (i was doing my thesis at that time) and she disappears and wont chat for days, until nawala yung momentum sa chat, to the point na nag mutual ghosting kami. 

We never really got to see each other on a date. 

A few years later, after having my worst breakup with another girl, I vowed to myself that I will NEVER date again. I told myself Im just gonna get so successful with my career out of spite and aggressively focused on improving my lifestyle. Dating was really out of the picture and I became so pessimistic with love that I genuinely believed I will end up being alone. 

Until I received a message in twt, from the SAME girl from Bumble who I ghosted (mutually ghosted??) saying in the lines of “hey, I know it’s been years but are you still up for a date?” 

I blinked. Blinked twice. I was just eating leftover food in my apartment. I remembered her, remembered how we ghosted each other (I cringed so hard and I hoped she didnt resent me for it!). I think at that moment, I figured I think I healed enough. Wasnt expecting anything I was just, okay lets finally meet this girl.

And so we finally met. She was waiting for me to clock out from my work in the nearby coffee shop. Saw her reading a Jane Austen book in one of the outdoor chairs outside the cafe. she looked way different now, masc-presenting, had a cute tattoo, nose piercing, and what the hell really really CUTE.

We shook hands (laughed at it bc do people normally shake hands on their first date??), had ramen together, laughed a lot, roamed around the park afterwards, she explained why it didn’t work before, because she was still dealing with personal problems, also came from a very toxic relationship and needed more time to heal. I was also not ready for a relationship bc of my research. We both thought it’s irrelevant now. 

We ended our first date exchanging socials, had another date again a few days later, had our first kiss, our first overnight, we met each other’s fams, her sisters are amazing, she loves my mom.

The rest was confetti.

It’s been years now since we reconnected and she has been amazing since. We both came from very toxic relationships, so we both appreciated the fact that things are easy and light now. Every day she restored my optimism in everything. Little by little. Until it somehow feels like my walls are finally breaking. Disagreements didn’t feel like a war between the two of us, it’s just a problem we need to solve together. We respect each other. We support each other. 

So to those who are still looking for their happy ending, DON’T LOSE HOPE. I was not expecting myself to be in a really healthy relationship (like is this real, pls pinch me). If you are in an unhealthy relationship, dont settle bc she is NOT the one. If you came from a breakup, heal in your own time. When you are ready, put yourself out there! Try to finally strike up a conversation with that cute girl, maybe give her number. Hell, you can even slide into the DMs of an old flame lol. 

Put trust in the universe that everything will fall into place, in the right time. It really is full of surprises.

Thank you so much for reading this long post and Happy Pride to all! 🏳️‍🌈❤️

I bring up with her how I feel hurt. To no one’s surprise the one she is dating is the ex she left because he was single and she still had feelings. I tried to bring up how I was hurt she moved on too fast and she said “she didn’t” and now I am conflicted. Am I the Asshole?,1,1751252822.0,AITAH,3,0.67,False

I don’t normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

[**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://10dddat6pbhe2td9vcude22alr.hop.clickbank.net/) 

Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.

Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel movements

Leaky gut or food intolerances

Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings

Skin issues like acne or rashes

Weakened immunity

Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

Then this product is 100% for you.

Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

❄️🦾Public reviews :

Prime Biome has received a mix of reviews from users worldwide. Many customers have reported positive experiences, particularly regarding skin improvements and digestive health.

For instance, Sarah from New York shared, “I would have never, ever dreamed that my skin could look so amazing. If you had told me two months ago that my dark spots and fine wrinkles would disappear with such a simple solution, I would have laughed in your face. I am so happy I gave this a try!”

Similarly, Alexa from Wyoming mentioned, “I used to need so much Botox to keep the wrinkles away that my face was permanently frozen. And it did nothing for the saggy skin on my chin and my turkey neck. A few weeks into using this PrimeBiome supplement and I am speechless! I wake up, I look in the mirror and I love what I see. No more expensive procedures and thousands of needles in my face for me. It’s simply unbelievable!”

But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.

Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel movements

Leaky gut or food intolerances

Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings

Skin issues like acne or rashes

Weakened immunity

Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

Then this product is 100% for you.

Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

❄️🦾Public reviews :

Prime Biome has received a mix of reviews from users worldwide. Many customers have reported positive experiences, particularly regarding skin improvements and digestive health.

For instance, Sarah from New York shared, “I would have never, ever dreamed that my skin could look so amazing. If you had told me two months ago that my dark spots and fine wrinkles would disappear with such a simple solution, I would have laughed in your face. I am so happy I gave this a try!”

Similarly, Alexa from Wyoming mentioned, “I used to need so much Botox to keep the wrinkles away that my face was permanently frozen. And it did nothing for the saggy skin on my chin and my turkey neck. A few weeks into using this PrimeBiome supplement and I am speechless! I wake up, I look in the mirror and I love what I see. No more expensive procedures and thousands of needles in my face for me. It’s simply unbelievable!”

Yes, I used AI to make it (I know, Im lazy). The things in the boxes just stand for random thoughts, sensations, or ideas/worries/beliefs that can pop up during the session. Don’t take what’s written in the boxes too seriously if it sounds silly - it’s just a metaphor for any thought or idea that may arise at any point during the session. 

When you meditate using this technique, there are two main things to keep in mind:

1. Watch your mind - just be in it. Don’t try to focus on anything specific like your breath or a mantra; just let yourself be and relax. 

2. When thoughts appear, don’t identify with them. See them as external objects or passing phenomena.

The idea is to create a bit of distance between you and your thoughts - so you can just watch them come and go without getting pulled in. **Keep your mental activity and your consciousness separate.**

Has anyone else ever felt that weird mix of excitement and, well, a little emptiness right after retiring? Like one minute you’re dreaming about lazy mornings and finally binge-watching that series everyone’s been raving about, and the next, you find yourself staring at the wall wondering what to do with all this *freedom*? 🙈 

That feeling has a name: the Retirement Blues. It’s more common than you'd think. We’ve spent decades gearing up for this phase, only to find ourselves feeling a tad lost when it finally arrives. But guess what? You can beat those blues without heading to the pharmacy. 🙌

Here are some of my favorite, and let’s be real, totally doable *strategies* to keep that joy alive in your golden years:

1. **Get Moving**: Have you ever noticed how a good walk or some light stretching can change your mood? Movement releases those happy hormones. Plus, nothing beats the post-workout glow! 🏃‍♂️

2. **Stay Social**: Call up that friend you haven’t seen since forever (you know, the one who always tells the best dad jokes). Or join a local club—be it book reading, knitting, or even pickleball! Social connections are crucial for our mental health. 😄

3. **Start a Passion Project**: Have something you’ve always wanted to try, like painting or gardening? Now’s your time to shine! 🎨🌱 Channel that creative energy into something that excites you and watch those blues fade away.

4. **Practice Gratitude**: It sounds cliché, but a little thanks can go a long way. Try jotting down three things you’re grateful for each day. It’ll shift your focus to the positive and remind you that, hey, life is pretty darn good! 

5. **Explore Mindfulness**: Whether it’s yoga, meditation, or simply sipping your morning coffee while watching the world go by—being present can help alleviate feelings of longing or restlessness. Plus, it’s an excuse to slow down and catch your breath! ☕️🧘‍♀️

6. **Volunteer**: Giving back not only helps others but can also work wonders for your mental state! Find a cause that resonates with you and dive in. The connection you build with others is priceless. ❤️

And remember, we believe in meaningful results. Sometimes it's about finding what lights us up and being proactive in pursuing it.

Ever have that moment when your brain feels like a stuffed suitcase, bursting at the seams with thoughts, to-do lists, and worries? You know, the kind of mental clutter that makes you want to curl up and watch Netflix for ten hours straight instead of tackling anything on your list? 🛋️

That’s where we’re at today! It's time to let it out and clear some space. Think of this as our very own mental garage sale—no item too random, no thought too silly to share.  

Here’s what I’m thinking:

- **What’s the one thing that keeps popping up in your mind like an unwanted pop-up ad?** Seriously, something that feels like it’s weighing your brain down. 
- **Is it that project at work that you just can’t seem to get motivated for?** You know, the one that makes you question your life choices at 3 AM? 
- **Or perhaps it’s a personal goal that feels so far away it might as well be on Mars?** 🚀 Honestly, why does that fitness change feel like mountain climbing on some days?  
- **Or maybe it’s just annoying everyday stuff?** Like how do I remind myself to drink more water when coffee looks so much more enticing?

Let’s be real for a second. **We all have days when we struggle.** And it's okay to not have it all figured out. Sometimes you just need to vent. It’s not about solving everything in one go. It’s about acknowledging what’s there, and that alone can be a relief. 

As we dive into this Brain Dump Bonanza, I’ll start with my own cluttered thought. Right now, I'm overwhelmed by the feeling that I should be more organized. Like, my work emails could really use a Marie Kondo-level transformation. But every time I dive in, I get distracted by (admit it, you’ve been there!) a meme or a coffee break that *just* felt necessary!

So, what’s in your clutter?  

- **Let’s slay that mental dragon together! 🚀** Share your thoughts, rants, or even those odd little worries that sneak up on you. This is a safe space; we’re all on the same team here.
- **And hey, if something resonates with you, why not hit that ‘upvote’ button?** Let’s build a wall of support as we uncover our thoughts together.

Remember, you’re not alone in this brain overload. Sometimes just putting it out there makes it feel a whole lot lighter. ✨ So, what’s weighing you down?",1,1751251636.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Blair was so grateful to be home. She just didn’t understand the demon that had possessed her boss during their recent business trip. He had driven everyone hard. They arrived home one day earlier than planned, but she was glad to be away from him.

She had expected to return to the office with him. To her surprise, he gave her the rest of the afternoon off. Maybe he’d decided they both needed a break. That was fine by her.

Lately, he’d been a real shithead. Short-tempered and demanding. When he dropped her off at her front door, she almost flipped him the bird. She paused, unsure whether he’d catch the gesture in the rear-view mirror.

Roman had this uncanny ability to sense everything. It was almost like he had eyes in the back of his head. You’d think being gorgeous would make him a bit easier to work with. But no. If anything, it made him more of an ass. He was hot, and he knew it. Most everyone always fell at his feet trying to please the man.

She didn’t know what was going on. Roman had seemed more irritable in the past few months. He’d been rubbing her the wrong way. Of the two years she’d worked for him, these last two months had been the worst. If he didn’t pay her so well, or if she didn’t need the job so badly, maybe she would tell him where to go.

Blair shook her head. That wasn’t true. Despite his sometimes shitty attitude, Roman did look after his staff. The benefits at Kingston’s were great. People put up with more for the right perks.

The office offered excellent medical and dental coverage. There was always childcare within the building, and the company was cutting back on maternity leave. It was a win-win for Kingston.

Blair picked up her case and headed for the front door of the townhouse she shared with her cousin Laura and her fiancé Dan.

She checked her watch as she reached the front door. Dan wouldn’t be home for a few hours. She planned to surprise him with a romantic dinner.

Laura was rarely home at night, always out partying. Her cousin was a model-not a supermodel, but still gorgeous. She knew how to make the most of it. Blair, on the other hand, wasn’t interested in clothes or makeup. She was more into books.

They had both moved to the city for different reasons. Laura to follow her modeling career and for Blair, it had been a chance to work for a great company like Kingston Industries. Under normally the great man himself Roman Kingston. The company had their fingers in so many pies, Blair was never bored. Even when Roman was being his most demanding. She loved her job.

Fishing for her keys. She juggled her briefcase, handbag, and suitcase. Once the key was in the lock, it turned easily. Blair pushed the door open. Stepping inside, she put her handbag and suitcase down at the bottom of the stairs. Before heading into the lounge room where she kept a desk. Sitting her briefcase on top.

Blair turned to make her way to the kitchen, pondering what to prepare for dinner. As she walked past the foot of the stairs, a sudden noise from upstairs caused her to halt in her tracks. Was there someone else in the house? Had she returned home to an intruder? Filled with panic, Blair took a step towards the front door, ready to flee.

However, at that moment, she realized something. Laura. Unlike Blair and Dan, Laura didn’t adhere to their typical working hours. She often slept late and stayed out until the early hours of the morning. It wasn’t the first time Blair had found her slumped on the front steps as she was leaving for work in the morning. Blair wasn’t sure if she should call out now. What if it wasn’t her cousin?

Her eyes scanned the room for something to defend herself with… just in case. Her gaze landed on her late father’s baseball bat, which she always kept near the front door when she was home alone at night. It made her feel safer.

She grabbed the bat, weighting it in her hand for a moment. Before she set foot on the stairs, she paused, wondering if any of them creaked. She couldn’t remember. Taking a deep breath to steady her racing heart, Blair ascended the stairs slowly, step by step.

When she reached the landing, she stopped, straining to listen.

“Please be Laura. Please be Laura, and not some masked man waiting to jump out at me,” she muttered under her breath.

The hallway stretched ahead, with four doors. Three led to the bedrooms, and one opened to the shared bathroom. The only door ajar was the one to her and Dan’s bedroom. The others were shut. But to get to her bedroom, she’d have to pass the other doors.

That’s when she heard it, the unmistakable sound of a giggle from Laura, followed by a low, male groan. Relief flooded her chest. It wasn’t a burglar. Laura had brought someone home.

Just as Blair was about to turn away and leave, she heard the voice of the man Laura was with.

“God, yes,” the voice groaned.

Blair froze, her heart pounding. No. It couldn’t be.

“Laura, you’re so fucking hot,” Dan’s voice came from their bedroom.

Her eyes widened. Dan. In their bed. With Laura. Blair’s stomach lurched.

This couldn’t be happening. She moved quietly down the hall until she stood outside her bedroom door, praying this was all some kind of terrible misunderstanding.

With a trembling hand, she pushed the door open.

The sight that greeted her was like a punch to the gut. She staggered backward, her mind unable to process what she was seeing.

There, in the middle of the bed, was Dan, flat on his back, with Laura straddling him, completely naked. She was moving up and down on him, her hands gripping his chest hair. From this angle, Blair could see Dan’s cock thrusting in and out of Laura. It felt like she was watching a scene from a porn film.

Dan’s hands gripped Laura’s waist and ass, guiding her movements.

“Err, yes, fuck me harder,” Laura moaned.

Blair lifted a hand to her mouth to stop herself from crying out. No, no, no, no.

Dan’s grip tightened on Laura’s ass, spreading her cheeks wider.

Blair had never seen Laura naked before, not that it mattered when she was currently riding Blair’s fiancé.

How could she do this? They had both watched Laura’s father, Peter, cheat repeatedly on Laura’s mother, creating a toxic home life. Blair had lived with them after losing her parents in a plane crash ten years ago. She had thought if anyone would understand the devastation of betrayal, it would be Laura.

This had to be a nightmare. Blair pinched herself, hard, as the sting registered immediately. Not a nightmare.

Dan had always hated Laura. He’d called her a slut. Mocked her outfits. Said she was shallow, incapable of real conversation.

Was it all a lie? Had he been jealous of the men in her life? Was that why?

One thing was certain, Dan’s mother, Paula, would never accept Laura as a suitable wife for her son.

But none of that mattered now. What was she supposed to do? How did someone handle this? It was like a scene from a B-grade movie.

She couldn’t pretend she hadn’t seen it. She didn’t want Dan anymore… not now, not after this. Taking him back would be disgusting.

How long had this been going on?

They had been living together for five months. Dan had moved in with her and Laura to save money before the wedding. Had he been fucking Laura the whole time?

“Laura, you are so goddamn tight,” Dan groaned, arching his back.

“Is my pussy better than Blair’s?” Laura asked, riding him harder.

Blair’s heart stopped. Did she know Blair was standing here? Had she asked that on purpose?

Blair bit into her hand to keep from making a sound. She had given Dan her virginity. He had known what that meant to her. Knowing that he had done this.

She hadn’t even planned to be home today. She had wanted to surprise him.

The surprise had been on her.

She felt sick. A cold sweat broke over her skin.

Her other hand came up, gripping the doorframe for balance. Something solid pressed against her palm. The bat.

For a fleeting second, she thought about using it. Smashing the bed, the nightstand, the both of them. But she wasn’t that person. She rested the bat against the doorframe just in case she changed her mind and used it on them.

So instead, she straightened her spine. Let the rage steel her so when she finally spoke, her voice was calm. Icy, emotionless.

“While you two finish up, should I cook dinner?”

# Chapter Two

“Fuck me.” Dan's head came up off the bed as he pushed Laura off his body. Blair could see the horror on his face when he saw her standing at the door. He’d been caught with his pants down, or off, as it was in this case. Laura scrambled across the bed, pulling a blanket over her naked body. Her face was filled with shock, showing her cousin hadn’t known of Blair’s presence. The expression she wore was incredibly real and impossible to fake.

“No thanks. Looks like Laura has taken care of that for you.” Blair was surprised how calm she sounded. When all she truly wanted to do was scream and shout and throw things. What would it accomplish? She would still have a broken relationship.

“Blair! What are you doing home today?” Dan’s cock was wet and laying limp against his leg. Having his fiance walk in on him mustn’t be a turn on, it would seem.

Blair lifted an eyebrow at him. “That’s what you are worried about? Might be an idea to cover up.”

Blair was watching Dan with narrowed eyes. She had loved him, but the person she saw now was ugly to her. It didn’t matter anymore that he was very attractive. To her, he was ugly. No one should cheat on someone they claimed to love. Even if someone had held a gun to her head, she would have refused. It was a shame Dan hadn’t felt the same. As far as she could see, Laura hadn’t needed to force him. Hearing them talk during the act had told her that.

Blair put the bat down, resting it against the wall near the door. Just in case. She told herself that she wouldn’t use it, but who knew? Crimes of passion that had to have come from somewhere. Normal everyday people committing a crime in the heat of the moment. So it was safer if she put it down. Blair then crossed her arms across her chest. Looking back to see Dan had gotten off the bed and was pulling on his work pants.

She flicked her eyes to Laura. The bitch now had a smug look on her face. It had replaced the look of shock. Why?

Blood was roaring in her ears as she came to terms with the total destruction of her personal life. She never wanted to see him again, but she and Dan both worked for Kingston. She had applied first. Dan hadn’t joined the company until a year later.

Blair decided then and there she would not be leaving her job. It was her only concrete thing she could hang onto, then she was keeping it. It wasn’t like they work directly together.

Dan took a step towards her, reaching out his hand. “Baby..”

Blair took a step back. “Don’t you dare touch me?” Not only could she not stomach it, but who knows where that hand had been?

The venom in Blair's voice brought him up short. He turned to look at Laura before returning his eyes to her face. Blair knew she was pale. Who wouldn’t be?

“You have to believe me. This was a one time thing. It will never happen again. It meant nothing.” Dan pleaded with her.

Blair could see the look on Laura's face. Even before seeing it, she knew he was lying. Dan had a tell. When he lied, his right eyebrow would go up. Before today, the lies had never been a big deal, just little things. Had she noticed it when he had talked about Laura in the past? Blair wasn’t sure. Because sometimes the sub-conscious mind could even fool ourselves.

“Do you know Dan? It doesn’t matter.” Blair angled her chin up as her nails dug into her palm. “This one time was all it took.”

“What.. No, Blair baby please, I love you.” Dan tried to take her in his arms.

Blair moved quickly, picked up the bat, and swung it so the end pressed up against his chest, pushing him back and holding him at bay. “Don’t even think about it.”

Dan looked down at the bat, raising his hands back at his shoulder level. “Please, she seduced me. You know what a slut she is. I was missing you.”

They both heard the gasp from the bed. Before Laura responded. “He’s lying Blair. This has been going on for months. Soon after, he moved in.”

“Shut up, you dumb bitch.” Dan turned to yell at her. Before saying to Blair. “She is lying.”

Blair shrugged. “Doesn’t matter. It only took the one time Dan.” She nudged him with the baseball bat. “Don’t call Laura a dumb bitch. I may never forgive her for this, but you were the one in a relationship, Dan, not her.” Blair could see Laura sliding out of the bed, scrambling around for her clothing, still holding the sheet to her breasts. “If you think she is a slut, what the fuck does that make you?” Blair knew she would not feel clean even if she had ten showers. This was going to take time.

Blair knew she couldn’t deal with anymore right now. She needed to leave before they were both dressed. She needed to think, to process. Turning on her heel, she ran down the stairs. Quickly grabbing the suitcase, handbag. Blair only just remembered the briefcase as she was about to leave through the front door.

“You stupid slut, why did you have to say anything?” Dan’s angry voice came from upstairs

Blair rushed to her desk, picked up the briefcase and stood at the front door, ready to leave. Knowing once she walked through it, she wasn’t coming back. She had no idea where she was going, but anywhere was better than here.

Following Dan’s insult came Laura's high-pitched squeal. “I’m not a slut Dan.”

“You and your big mouth. You wanted this to happen, didn’t you?” Dan accused.

Blair could hear the tears in Laura's voice. “You didn’t mind my mouth when it was sucking your cock.”

“Shh.” Dan was worried she was hearing their argument. “You set me up, didn’t you? You knew she was coming home.”

“Dan I didn’t know.” Laura cried.

If she stayed any longer, both of them would have gotten dressed and then they would come down here, and she didn’t want another confrontation.

Taking a deep breath, Blair stepped through the front door, not looking back even as she heard Dan calling her name from inside the house.

# Chapter Three

Blair waved down a taxi. She shoved open the taxi door and climbed into the backseat as quickly as she could, intent on getting out of here as fast as possible. She felt like getting drunk. But if she went to a bar alone during the day, that would be inviting trouble. She could feel the tears as they slid unchecked down her face. She had held herself together while she had confronted Dan and Laura.

“Where to?” the driver asked, his voice cutting through the fog in her brain.

Where to? Good question.

Home wasn’t an option. Sutton and Keira were at work, and she didn’t want to sit in their empty apartment, replaying the image of Dan tangled in her cousin’s sheets. She needed a drink. But sitting alone in a bar in the middle of the afternoon? That felt like waving a white flag.

She hesitated, then rattled off the address of her office. At least there, she could pretend to be productive. Maybe even figure out what the hell to do next.

The taxi pulled away from the kerb and she exhaled, trying to steady herself.

The driver looked at her in the rearview mirror. “There are tissues in the center compartment if you need them, hon.”

The driver’s voice was gentle, like he’d seen enough women cry in his backseat to know when to speak and when to keep quiet.

Blair grabbed a handful. “Thanks.” She said before cleaning her face as best she could. It wasn’t like she wore a lot of makeup. So she might as well clean her face.

Her phone began to ring. Dan.

She still pulled it out of her to check. Her stomach clenched as she stared at the screen, his name glowing in bright white letters.

She could just imagine the first words he would say.

“It’s not what it looks like, Blair.”

“I can explain.”

“Please, just let me talk to you.”

Lies. Excuses. The same bullshit men always spewed when they got caught.

She set the phone to silent and shoved it back into her bag.

By the time the taxi pulled up in front of the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries, her makeup was beyond saving. She reached into her purse, dug out a crumpled twenty, and handed it to the driver.

“Be honest,” she said, forcing a smile. “Do I look like a woman who just found out her fiancé is screwing her cousin?”

The driver hesitated, giving her a careful once-over. “Your eyes are a little red, honey, but it’s hardly noticeable.” He paused. “Are you going to be okay?”

The unexpected kindness nearly undid her.

She swallowed the lump in her throat and nodded. “Yeah. Better to find out now, right? Just a little dump on the road of life.” She wasn’t sure who she was trying to convince the taxi driver or herself.

After paying the driver in cash, she climbed out of the taxi, hoisted her suitcase onto the curb and took a deep breath. Blair checked her phone screen to see Dan had called her six times and left six messages on her voicemail. Uninterested in what he had to say for himself, she slid the phone away in her handbag.

Blair turned toward the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries. Roman had bought the building five years ago. The top eight floors belonged to Kingston, the lower three rented out to smaller businesses. With the way the company was expanding, she wouldn’t be surprised if they took over the whole thing eventually.

She walked inside, adjusting her bag on her shoulder.

“Miss Warner, Can I help you?” Blair blinked. Maggie, one of the receptionists, had stepped out from behind the lobby front desk, her gaze flicking over Blair.

Maggie stepped forward, taking the suitcase from her. In the same hand, she was still holding the bat. Blair had completely forgotten that she was even holding it in her hand.

Blair had walked into the office looking like she was about to commit a felony. She was relieved, though. It was something she wouldn’t need to retrieve later.

Blair exhaled, relieved. “Thanks, Maggie. Can I leave everything here while I freshen up?” She was surprised her voice sounded so... normal.

“Of course, Miss Warner.” Maggie’s eyes darted to the bat again.

“Blair, please. How many times do I have to tell you?” Roman preferred first names, but some staff-especially the newer ones-struggled with that.

More with Roman than with her.

Maggie smiled, taking the suitcase, briefcase, and bat.

Blair headed across the foyer to the restroom.

Inside, she went straight to the mirrors. The cab driver hadn’t just been kind. She really didn’t look that bad. She pulled a makeup wipe from her bag and cleaned off the last remnants of mascara. A quick dusting of powder, some lip gloss, a little eyeliner.

She pinched her cheeks. People always said that added color, but she didn’t see a difference.

Her blue eyes were still a little red, but there wasn’t much she could do about that. She pulled out a brush, freed her long, wavy blonde hair from its bun, and redid it neatly. Good enough.

She left the restroom, retrieved her belongings from Maggie, and headed to the elevators. As she waited, she tried to recall Roman’s schedule. Did he have any meetings this afternoon?

Then it hit her. He shouldn’t have been home today. So no meetings were scheduled in his calendar.

She sighed. Her brain was fried. But walking in on your fiancé shagging your cousin would do that to anyone.

The thought made her frown.

How often had they been doing this? Dan had been at home during a workday. She traveled occasionally for work, but not that often. If their affair had been going on for months, they had to have been meeting up on company time.

The elevator arrived. A woman she didn’t recognize stepped in with her.

Blair offered a polite, strained smile. When the woman got off at the second floor, Blair leaned back against the wall, staring at nothing.

Should she tell Roman about Dan? It would feel like sour grapes-tattling just because he cheated. But he was also ripping off the company. No way could he get home, have sex with Laura, and get back to the office during a lunch break.

The elevator dinged open. Blair inhaled deeply before stepping onto the executive floor.

Kara, the receptionist on the executive floor, looked up. “Hey, Blair. I didn’t think you’d be in today.”

Blair smiled. “Wasn’t planning to be, but I figured I’d get a jump on the meeting notes for Roman. Is he in?”

Kara shook her head. “No, he left a little while ago. Called to have his calls held.”

Blair almost sagged in relief. She wouldn’t have to face him just yet.

“Thanks, Kara.”

She went to her office, shut the door, and sank into her chair.

Blair rested her head on the desk. Shit. She felt like a wrecking ball had just split her world in two.

How could he? But even worse than that, how could Laura?

The childish problems they had all had as kids, Blair had thought, they had grown out of that. Laura had always been a spoiled brat. Taking what wasn’t hers.

The problem was her parents, Blair’s aunt and uncle, doted on her and gave her everything she wanted. But when they had moved to the city two years ago, Laura hadn’t been that bad or by now Blair would have moved in with her sisters. She hadn’t when Sutton had come back from Europe because her sister Keira had just finished university. Keira had moved in with Sutton. She would have felt guilty leaving Laura on her own to move in with her sisters. What was the point, anyway? She and Dan had planned on getting a place of their own once they were married.

Lifting her head, Blair looked down at the ring on her finger. The engagement ring Dan had given her.

It wasn’t big. She hadn’t wanted big. She would make sure he got it back. He could sell it. Because she was sure Laura would want a big flashy ring. She had made fun of Blair’s ring.

Taking it off, Blair was about to throw it across the room. No, just in case it went missing. Opening the top drawer of her desk, Blair dropped it in, slamming it shut. She needed a drink. Standing, Blair went into Roman’s office, where she knew he kept a bottle of scotch. She wasn’t much of a spirit drinker, but anything would do.

Roman office was a statement of the man himself. Everything was big, strong, and masculine. “Don’t forget intimidating.” Blair said to the empty room.

Going to his desk, she opened the bottom drawer and pulled out the bottle of scotch that Roman kept there. Taking it, she sat down on his Chestfield lounge near the window. She opened the bottle and took a drink. Almost coughing it back up. “Holy shit, this shit burns.” Blair knew it was an expensive bottle Roman only liked the best.

The problem was, it was straight. Why did he like this shit straight? This time, when she put the bottle to her mouth, Blair made sure to sip it this time. Nope, that didn’t help. But it wasn’t as bad as the first drink. So she had another. Laying her head back against the lounge. She had come here to think. What was her next move?

Lifting her hand so she could see the dial on her watch, Blair saw it was 3:15pm. She couldn’t call Sutton or Keira. Not yet. Let them get home from work. Blair planned to ask Sutton and Keira to assist her in organizing getting her stuff from the apartment. Although she didn’t want to put too much pressure on her older sister, Sutton. She was six months pregnant, and it hadn’t been an easy pregnancy.

Men. Why were they assholes? First, her boss for being so arrogant and intimidating and sometimes rude. Then Dan, who had been cheating on her with her cousin Laura for months. How low was that? Then there was Luca, the father of Sutton’s baby. Who had left her high and dry and pregnant?

Then she would see about crashing at their place until she could find somewhere. Their place wasn’t big enough for three adults and a baby. When it arrived. But it would be great to spend some time with her sisters. Eat ice cream and talk shit about men.

Although Sutton didn’t even talk about the man that had gotten her pregnant. It was a topic she refused to discuss. Even when their aunt Viv and uncle Peter had demanded answers. Blair lifted the bottle again to her mouth. Only she and Keira knew his first name.

The phone started ringing on Roman’s desk. Blair tried to ignore it, but as soon as it stop ringing it started again. Blair shifted to the edge of the lounge, rising to her feet. The room seemed to tilt ever so slightly, prompting a quick “Oops.” to escape her lips.

After regaining her balance, she made her way over to the phone and lifted the receiver.

“Hello?” she greeted into the handset. Not very professional, she thought.

“Roman please.” Blair knew the voice. It was Claire Robertson. Roman’s little piece of fluff. It was the best way to describe Claire. She had this stupid girly voice that set Blair’s teeth on edge.

“Roman isn’t here.” Blair put a hand on Roman’s desk to help stop the swaying of the room.

“Where is he?” Claire asked.

“How the hell should I know?” Blaire was surprised by her answer. Shit, where had that come from?

“You are his secretary.” Blair could hear the anger in the other woman’s voice.

“Yes, but I’m not his keeper and I sure as hell don’t own a crystal ball. Call or message his mobile.” Blair was over this conversation.

“He isn’t answering his mobile hasn’t for days.” Claire whined.

Blair’s lips parted slightly. Oh.

That was Roman’s move. He didn’t argue, didn’t make dramatic exits. He just started to avoid before making a clean break. If Claire hadn’t heard from him in days, it was over. She just didn’t know it yet.

The little devil on her shoulder made her do it. But Blair couldn’t help the next words. “Well, one of two things has happened. Either you’re about to get dumped, or he’s dead. Either way, flowers will be involved.”

Blair sighed when she heard the shocked gasp from the other end of the phone, the scotch warming her veins, and loosening her tongue. “Look, Claire, let’s be honest. He’s not marriage material. Find someone new.” She didn’t wait for a reply, just hung up and dropped the receiver back into place.

She collapsed back onto the Chesterfield, lifting the bottle to her lips again.

Her own problems resurfaced to haunt her. How was she so blind? How did she not pick up on the signs? She wasn’t an idiot. Dan was a salesman. He had sold her the dream of happily ever after. She had just been blind to the cracks in their relationship.

Not only that, it looked like she had been missing something in her sex life. If what she had witnessed between Dan and Laura was any indication of how the act should be. She enjoyed it well enough, but it wasn’t something that made her cry out like Laura had been doing. Was that to stroke his ego? Should she have been doing that? The thing was, she didn’t know.

Dan had been her only lover. It had been his job to teach her.

Blair sighed, lifting the bottle again-only to pause when she noticed two tall, blurry figures standing in front of her.

Wait. No. Not two. Just one.

Blair squinted. “Hi.”

She tried to sit up, bringing the bottle to her mouth, but before she could take another sip, it was plucked from her hand.

“Hey,” she protested. “That’s mine. If you want one, go find your own.”

She blinked, trying to focus.

The man standing in front of her-the one holding the bottle-came into view.

“Roman?”

“Blair,” he said, his voice unreadable. “What have you done to yourself?”

“Well,” she said, slurring slightly, “I think that’s... pretty obvious. As you can see, I’m getting shit-faced.” She reached for the bottle. “Now give it back so I can finish the job.”

Roman stepped away, placing the bottle on his desk. “I think you’ve had enough.”

Blair frowned. “You know... sometimes you can be an asshole. No-most of the time.”

“I do believe you’re going to regret this tomorrow.”

Then, to her surprise, he sat down beside her.

# Chapter Four

“You’re not just an asshole, but a shithead too... always thought so,” Blair slurred, her tongue feeling too heavy in her mouth. She knew she shouldn’t be saying this, but she couldn’t stop herself.

Roman chuckled, leaning back. “I think I should get you some coffee.”

“Don’ want it.” Blair waved a hand dismissively, nearly hitting herself in the face. “I want... a man that ain’t a cheatin’ rat.” Her eyes drifted over him, and despite her best efforts, she noticed-really noticed-how attractive he was. “Did you... did you ever cheat on your ex-wife?”

She’d met Jessica once. It hadn’t been a pleasant experience.

Roman’s expression didn’t change, but his voice softened. “Not all men cheat, Blair.”

“W-why’d she leave you then?” Her head tilted as if she were trying to piece together a puzzle.

“There are a lot of reasons marriages fall apart,” Roman said, dragging a hand down his face. “Not all of them have to do with cheating on the man’s part.”

It took Blair a moment to process that. Then her eyes widened. “She cheated on you?” she whispered, as if it were some great secret. “Was she an idiot?”

Her boss was gorgeous-thick dark hair, intense gray eyes, chiseled cheekbones. And his body... well, from what she could see, it was fine. Not that she’d ever been interested before. She’d always been with Dan. Had been with Dan.

Roman reached over, gently lifting her chin with two fingers when her mouth fell open. “I worked a lot. Some would say I drove her to it.”

Blair blinked at him, then shook her head, making herself dizzy. “Thass not an excuse... nope... no, no, no.” She dropped her head back onto the couch, exhaling loudly. “Should get a divorce before that... cheaters... all of ‘em...”

Roman studied her with an amused expression. “You know, this is the most I’ve ever seen you relax around me.”

Blair lifted a hand lazily. “Thass ‘cause you’re... you’re normally soooo difficult to deal wit’” she muttered, barely able to get the words out.

“I won’t apologize for that.” His lips twitched. “I expect the best. That’s why this company is where it is today.”

Blair made a sound that was half a grunt, half a laugh. “Suppose so...” Her head felt heavy, her thoughts sluggish.

Roman let her sit in silence for a moment before asking, “What happened, Blair?”

She turned her head to look at him, her vision slightly unfocused. “I was an idiot.”

“Why? Because you trusted the wrong person?”

Blair let out a shaky breath. “Dan an’ I grew up together, y’know?”

“No, I didn’t.”

She nodded. “I... I was always going home... back home, all the time, when I moved to th’ city for this job. He... he got a job at Kingston’s, and I was happy ‘bout it. Now I wish he wasn’t here.” Her voice wobbled, but she refused to cry. Not again. Not for Dan.

“So, the wedding’s off?” Roman gestured to her bare finger.

Blair lifted her hand, staring at it for a second before letting it flop back onto her lap. “Yep. We didn’t even have a date set.”

“Who was holding it up?”

She blinked at him. Why was he askin’ so many questions? Why was he bein’ so... nice? “Me. He wanted to get married last year. I wasn’t ready.”

Roman’s eyes narrowed slightly. “Why? If you loved him, why did you want to wait?”

Blair shrugged, though it was a little sloppy. “If what I saw t’day was anythin’ to go by...” She trailed off, frowning. Maybe... maybe she’d always known somethin’ was off. There was no passion. No fire. She’d loved Dan, but maybe not the way she was supposed to love the man she was gonna marry.

Right now, she wasn’t even sad. Just... angry.

“What happened?” Roman pressed, his voice gentler now.

Blair’s face scrunched up as she remembered. “Saw him,” she slurred. “H-havin’ sex with... ugh.” She waved a hand, unable to finish the sentence.

Roman’s jaw tensed. “I see.”

Blair stared at him for a long moment, her head swimming with thoughts she couldn’t quite hold on to. Then, suddenly, she reached out, grabbing his tie between her fingers.

Roman froze.

Blair stared at the fabric, tracing the pattern with unfocused eyes. She didn’t know why she did it. Maybe ‘cause she needed to know. Needed to feel something different.

Without another thought, she pulled at the tie, closing the space between them, and pressed her lips to his.

For a moment, he didn’t move. But then… Heat. Raw, consuming heat.

Blair gasped into his mouth, the shock of it searing through her. Her hands flew to his shoulders, gripping the fabric of his shirt, desperate to hold on to something solid.

This was different. So different.

Roman pulled back, breathing hard, his gray eyes dark with something unreadable. “Blair,” he murmured, voice rough. “We shouldn’t-“

She cut him off with another kiss, moving closer, pressing against him.

“Please,” she whispered, her voice trembling.

She needed to forget.

And she wanted… to feel.

According to the US State Department security service, **""neighborhoods to the east of the city center like Colonia Palmira and San Carlos, as well as the area around the Multiplaza Mall / Boulevard de Juan Pablo II offer lower risk areas for international visitors, but even these areas are known to see muggings. Villa Nueva, El Rincon, Kennedy, and Comayagüela represent some of the higher crime neighborhoods in the city.""**

And according to Insight Crime, **""Due to its geographic location, Honduras  is one of the most important drug trafficking transshipment points  between South America and Mexico. With every branch of government and its armed forces plagued by corruption, the Central American nation has long played a vital role as a  transit point in which criminal groups enjoy official protection.**

**Over the last two decades, political protection has allowed traditional drug trafficking groups to flourish. Testimony provided by drug traffickers and Honduran politicians on trial in the United States has revealed deep-seated connections between organized crime and major political parties.** 

**Control of illegal activities in Honduras lies in the hands of local criminal groups connected to the country’s political and economic elite. The judicial system suffers from political manipulation and corruption, as well as a lack of transparency and capacity. Meanwhile, the Honduran police have proven to be one of the most corrupt public institutions. The Army has also been accused of participating in criminal activities.**

**Most recently, the country’s crime groups have evolved and are now cultivating coca and processing their own cocaine after years of low-level experimentation, which has permanently altered the country’s drug trafficking infrastructure.""**

I also known that theres no middle class in Honduras, theres only the rich and EXTREMELY poor. The economy is mainly agricultural, accounting for like 14% of the GDP, but I don't know if that means the most common job is a farmer or if thats just the industry that contributes most to the economy. I know that the biggest export of Honduras is coffee, its biggest import is minerals and stuff, which it is rich in, I know that most people think the police are corrupt, I know that taxis are controlled by gangs in some parts of the country, especially in urban areas.  
  
I'd say I know the characteristics, structure, and dynamics of MS-13 and Barrio 18 inside and out, I know that they're extremely violent enemies to each other despite being nearly indistinguishable, but what I don't know is what methods they use to attack each other. Do they use certain weapons, like 9mm pistols are ak-style machine guns? I know that they're notorious for the use of machetes, at least historically, but do they still use that in confrontations with each other? How do they communicate with each other, telegram or discord or what? Where do they live? In California they live in abandoned buildings called ""destroyers"", is it the same in honduras? I know that a lot of them have normal jobs as well. 

And Yulan, the short guy with a 5 million dollar bounty who leads all of MS-13 in Honduras, whats the structure below him look like? Who are his seconds-in-commands, and who are the leaders below them? And what does their Barrio 18 counterpart command-and-control structures look like? 

Is there any video footage or recordings of honduras? I mean like, stuff from people who've recorded incidents on their phones either out in the open or discreetly, along with security camera footage, car footage, etc.?

Does law enforcement in Honduras use bodycams? 

Is there any organized or individual resistance to MS-13 or Barrio 18 in Honduras, similar to Mexico with the cartels or ISIS and Assad in Syria? And is there any media or reports of that type of stuff? ",1,1751251346.0,Honduras,1,1.0,False

But along the way during our joke time moments, nakwento niya about his *totga* na nameet niya rin through common friends back in 2019 who ghosted him after their 1 year talking stage. That nong August 2024 nagchat daw ulit si totga sa kanya but ghosted him again after sometime. And admittedly he felt happy daw ulit during their rekindled communication tho short-lived.

Reflection: i was madly in love with him last year na nag-uusap kami

Only to find out na may iba palang nagpapatibok ng puso niya at sabay niya pala kaming kausap noong August 2024 :(( 

Malandi ba siya sakin? Yes, lagi nya sinasabi na future jowa nya ako ever since start of 2024

Previous attempt: None

Please please, be brutally honest with me from your POVs redditors. 

Questions:
Is this my fault?
Nag-expect lang ba ako kaya the mention of totga hurts?
Am I overthinking?

I am super lean, I am just really muscular. I climb up to v9 and do yoga so I just have a body that reflects that. Every time I wear a sleeveless shirt at the gym (or in the world at all) people stare at me. And no that's not in my head, they STARE at me. Sometimes strangers make comments about how ""jacked"" I am, sometimes women compliment me and ask what I do (literally nothing except climb hard boulders), sometimes people even touch my arms without asking, the other day at the coffee shop at 7am the barista gawked at my arms and was like ""oh my god your ARMS"" and it made me want to fucking throw coffee in her face. Because most of the time I just want to live and not be gawked at like some weird side show? I know it's ""a compliment"" but I'm existing outside the boundaries of what you are supposed to look like as a woman

I am 5'3 and as of today 113.2 pounds. I have like very low body fat so it's mostly muscle like you can see the veins in my biceps not just my forearms. I never wanted my body to look like this, I certainly never TRIED to make it look like this, I just climb hard boulders. OH people have also made jokes about how I take steroids or something too. It honestly makes me feel so bad about myself lol

It makes me think this is partly why I'm perpetually single too, because I'm too masculine, like I'm stronger than most of the men at the climbing gym. I'm not like power lifter body, just my back and arms are very ""cut"" I guess.

idk I'm sick of people telling me I'm ""jacked"" it makes me want to stop doing sports and starve myself into being a waif again. I feel like the trope that men don't like women who are strong is kind of true. They like to think they like us, but they usually in my experience just want to have sex with us or it's like a fun ""different"" thing then they marry a tiny quiet girl

Is this all in my head? I am sorry if this seems like a ""humble brag"" or whatever but I honestly hate my muscular athletic body so much because people won't stop fucking bringing attention to it unprompted",8,1751251093.0,rs_fitness,20,0.9,False

I was desperate for rest after bouts of depression and anxiety. It had been a long-ass battle I had to silently fight. I was in the middle of submissions, revisions, advanced readings for a postgrad while finishing my current postgrad. My ambitious and spirited self was right at the edge of exhaustion

Generally, I was tired. And I met you

You came in with this energy, enthusiasm with this vigor and sweetness. You were intense. Honestly, from the very beginning, you scared me. And I should have blocked you

But then the game started

I thought it was harmless. I was tired. And over a cup of coffee, after deciding to pursue another degree, a friend told me, “Maybe there’s no harm done.” That made sense. It wasn’t supposed to be serious because, heck, I didn’t even want serious

It became playful. You said so many words

And I someone whose mind was already dulled by skepticism toward men found it ironic. I saw it. I even found it funny, how after just a few days, you had the audacity to talk about a “sense of peace.” How you invoked deep words, tried to make sense of your breakup by comparing it to what you claimed to feel about me

And still, I entertained it. Because I was tired. Because I needed a break from all the seriousness and defensiveness

I liked the attention. I liked the game. It made me feel alive. And for some sick reason, I missed that feeling. I had grown boring after years of forgetting how to feel and focusing only on becoming independent

It was fun. And no I never entered it with grand illusions. I knew what I was getting into

But then you had the audacity to make a grand gesture. To make me question my own beliefs.
To persuade me to open the cracks and let you in

Only to show me, the very next day, that people like you who claim authenticity and honesty are sometimes the most fake of all

What did you say again? “Sorry”?

Sorry for what, exactly? I wanted to laugh. You sounded ridiculous

I asked myself, why did I let you in? Why did I let you get close?

Maybe it’s because I was vulnerable and tired. Maybe I liked the attention. Maybe I craved intimacy. That easy kind of love that claims to be real. Maybe I wanted it to be easy and you made it seem that way

But I rest in this truth: I entered that game willingly. Before you could make me more foolish, I saw you. And I paid you back

1. Files look done but often aren’t — We thought we had all the print files done, but the manufacturer flagged issues with layers, bleeds, and color profiles. It delayed us 2 weeks.  
2. Screen colors ≠ print colors. Our bright red tokens came out duller than expected.

## Key Features Analysis

The durability, appearance, and overall quality of a round marble table top depend heavily on its key features. Understanding these features will enable you to make a more informed purchase, ensuring you select a table top that meets your specific needs and preferences.

**Marble Type:** The type of marble used substantially impacts the table top's appearance and durability. Carrara marble, known for its subtle gray veining on a white background, is a popular choice for its classic elegance. Calacatta marble, with its bolder and more dramatic gold or grey veining, offers a more luxurious and distinct look. Other varieties like Nero Marquina (black marble with white veining) and Emperador (brown marble with white and gold veining) provide different aesthetic options.the density and porosity of different marble types also vary, affecting their resistance to stains and scratches.

Choosing the right marble type is crucial for both aesthetics and functionality. A marble with a lower porosity will be more resistant to stains, making it ideal for high-traffic areas or dining tables where spills are likely to occur. The appearance you choose defines the character of the table top and ideally, the room it occupies.

**edge Profile:** The edge profile refers to the shape and finish of the table top's edge. Common options include bullnose (rounded edge), beveled (angled edge), ogee (an S-shaped curve), and straight edge (a clean, modern look). The edge profile not only contributes to the overall aesthetic but also affects the table top's safety and comfort. A rounded edge is typically safer,while a beveled or ogee edge can add a touch of elegance and sophistication.

The choice of edge profile should be based on both aesthetic preference and practicality. A rounded edge is often preferred for households with children, as it reduces the risk of injury. A straight edge offers a contemporary look and is easy to clean.Before committing to a style it is important to consider how the edge profile affects the surrounding decor.

**Thickness:** The thickness of the marble table top directly impacts its strength and stability. A thicker table top, typically 1.25 inches or more,provides greater resistance to cracking and warping. Thinner table tops, while lighter and potentially more affordable, may be more susceptible to damage, especially with heavy use.

A suitable thickness will improve overall experience and durability for the table top. For larger table sizes, a thicker marble slab is recommended to prevent sagging and ensure structural integrity. The table's base should be chosen to correctly support the dimensions of the table to further ensure stability.

**Surface Finish:** The surface finish of the marble table top influences its appearance and tactile qualities. Polished finishes offer a high-gloss shine that enhances the marble's veining and creates a luxurious feel. Honed finishes, conversely, provide a matte look with a smooth, velvety texture. Leathered finishes offer a textured surface that adds dimension and depth.

The finish of a table-top must balance look and feel with ease of care. Polished finishes may be more prone to scratches, while honed finishes are generally more resistant to everyday wear and tear. Ultimately, the choice of surface finish depends on the desired aesthetic effect and the level of maintenance you're willing to undertake.

Key features of round marble table tops include:

*   Variety of marble types (Carrara, Calacatta, nero Marquina, etc.)
*   Choice of edge profiles (bullnose, beveled, ogee, straight)
*   Range of thicknesses for enhanced durability
*   Selection of surface finishes (polished, honed, leathered)

The staff are certainly friendly and helpful. The lobby and room were very clean with nice decor. There is also valet parking which is convenient in NYC. While the elevators are slow, there are 26 floors. On the other hand, why are there only two elevators for those 26 floors? We stayed in a City Lights suite: The sitting area of our room was spacious; spacious, that is, as long as the sofa isn’t opened into a bed. It had a desk, a credenza, a chair for the desk and a chair for sitting. There are two square ottomans which I am not sure what their purpose is because they don’t seem to go with the room and take up space. The kitchen area had a refrigerator and a dishwasher, a microwave and plates, bowls and coffee cups. The drawers, however, have scuff marks on one side, possibly from the dishwasher door? Where are people going to use those plates and bowls since there is no coffee table and the credenza is awkward to eat on? The bedroom had a large king size bed which I found to be too big for the room. There is room for only one person to pass by the foot of the bed and not much room at that. The one big problem I found with the bedroom is that there was no way to cool it down. I set the thermostat for 61, but it showed the room temperature initially at 72 and then it went up to 74. Maintenance has got to look into this. Another issue I had with the bedroom is that there is no door. This could account for the fact that the room never got cool. There was a chifforobe in the bedroom but no other closet space. Meaning luggage has to be kept in a corner of the hotel room. There was a large mirror in the hallway, opposite the bedroom. Looks nice but on closer inspection, there are missing tiles in the frame around it. The bathroom was the high point of the room with lots of light. A fantastic rain shower with a glass door that swings open rather than slides. I just wish the shower head had more settings on it.

Music is my passion—it's the core of my life. I’ve curated a playlist that spans around 20 hours, featuring everything from Big Band classics to SZA!

I'm an avid reader and a huge fan of audiobooks. Since I travel frequently, listening to books is a convenient way for me to enjoy stories. Plus, I love the experience of being read to! I often listen at double speed, so if you want to chat about literature, I’d be thrilled.

Movies are another love of mine, especially dramas, rom-coms, musicals, and some thrillers and comedies. The last film I caught in theaters was ""Materialists."" I enjoyed it, although it wasn't as romantic as I expected—so I might see it again with a fresh perspective.

Theater, ballet, and opera . I adore dressing up to witness exceptionally talented performances—it’s always a magical experience.

When it comes to food, I enjoy dining out and experiencing new restaurants. While I can cook and do enjoy it, I’m currently in a phase where exploring brunch and dinner spots with friends is my preference. I’m a big fan of iced coffee and enjoy sharing too much champagne with good company! 

I'm looking for someone aged between 26 and 50, located in the United States, who shares my preference for voting blue. Connecting with like-minded individuals is essential for me.
