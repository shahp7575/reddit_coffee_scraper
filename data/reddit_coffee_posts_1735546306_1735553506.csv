1. **Resting Bitch Face**: Your face is relaxed, but everyone thinks you’re plotting their demise. Spoiler: you’re just contemplating lunch.

2. **Sarcastic Genius**: Your humor is sharper than a sword, but sometimes it cuts a little too deep. Not everyone gets your wit!

3. **Honesty Enthusiast**: You speak the truth like it’s going out of style. “Does this dress make me look fat?” might get a brutal, “Yes!” from you.

4. **Punctuality Overlord**: You show up early, but it feels like you’re trying to win a gold medal in annoying your friends.

5. **King/Queen of Over-Analysis**: While others casually discuss dinner plans, you turn it into a full-on debate complete with PowerPoint slides.

6. **Know-It-All Vibes**: You drop facts like confetti, but sometimes people just want to enjoy their ignorance in peace.

7. **The Silent Treatment**: You think you’re giving people space, but they just think you’ve gone full mime mode on them.

8. **Social Media Stalker**: You like posts just to “support” but have never even said hi to these folks face-to-face.

9. **Overzealous Grammar Police**: You can’t resist correcting typos in texts, and yeah, the “your vs. you’re” battle can escalate quickly.

10. **Non-Stop Recommendations**: You share the best binge-worthy series, but sometimes they just want to watch their guilty pleasure without judgment.

11. **Cutting Off Conversations**: Your phone gets more attention than the person next to you, and not everyone is thrilled about that.

12. **#NoFilter**: Your unfiltered thoughts fly out of your mouth, but not everyone is ready to hear your opinion on their choice of ice cream.

13. **Too Competitive**: Whether it’s board games or karaoke, your intense need to win makes you come off like you’ve never lost a game in your life.

14. **Overly Attached**: You just really like your friends, but they sometimes feel smothered, like they’re trying to breathe underwater.

15. **Always the Critic**: You have a discerning taste, but it can make you sound like you’re hosting your own version of “American Idol” – for everything.

16. **Cutting to the Chase**: You skip the small talk, but not everyone is ready to dive into their life story at 8 AM over coffee.

17. **Enthusiastic Over-sharer**: Your life is an open book, but some folks would prefer a pamphlet.

18. **Interrupting Expert**: You’re just excited to contribute, but it ends up feeling like people need a traffic light to get a word in.

19. **No Time for ‘Fluff’**: You hate fluff conversations; your friends just want to catch up!

20. **Obsessive Planner**: You live your life by a detailed spreadsheet, and your friends feel like they’re planning a military operation every time they hang out.

21. **Foodie Snob**: You’ve tried every trendy restaurant and have a take on every dish, but sometimes a burger and fries is what the soul craves.

22. **Unintentional Shade**: You don't mean to throw shade; it's just the way your eyebrows are coded.

23. **Challenging the Norm**: You question every convention, and while it’s thought-provoking, it can be exhausting for those who just want to enjoy their vanilla latte.

24. **Know-It-All in the Group**: You constantly find loopholes in everything, and while that’s impressive, it can be tiresome.

25. **Eyebrow Raising Recommendations**: You suggest only the “classics,” but your friends might want that guilty pleasure Netflix series.

26. **“Just Kidding” Overload**: Every time you throw out a barb, you soften it with “just kidding,” but sometimes it doesn’t quite land as intended.

27. **The Informal Advisor**: You love offering unsolicited advice, which can make you sound less like a friend and more like a life coach.

28. **The “Influencer” Among Friends**: You tend to document every dinner out, but not everyone needs their meal chronicled on Instagram.

29. **Selective Listening**: You sometimes zone out during deep conversations, and it feels like you’re mentally drafting your shopping list.

30. **One-Upping Pro**: Your stories always have to be more dramatic, and it can seem like you need a trophy for the most interesting life.

31. **Emphasis on Logic**: You approach every problem with cold hard facts, while others need a cup of tea and a hug.

32. **Tech-Savvy Genius**: You fix technology in seconds, but it makes others feel like they should be using a rotary phone.

33. **Literal Interpretations**: You take things too literally at times, sending your friends into fits of laughter or brisk confusion.

34. **Curiosity Gone Wild**: You pry into people’s lives under the guise of caring, but sometimes boundaries are a good thing.

35. **Critic vs. Comedian Ratio**: Your humor often turns critical, and it’s hard to tell when you’re joking or not. 

36. **Overzealous Tradition Keeper**: You insist on following every tradition to the letter, leaving little room for spontaneity.

37. **Always Right**: You back your opinions with facts, but no one enjoys playing Devil’s Advocate for too long.

38. **Sports Fanatic**: Your passion for your favorite team turns every hangout into a heated debate. Not everyone is in for a 3-hour marathon on last night’s game.

39. **Overly Direct**: Your straightforwardness is a double-edged sword; it can be refreshing or brutally honest to the point of feeling savage.

40. **Self-Proclaimed “Funny” Friend**: You think you’re the hilarious one in the group, but sometimes your timing is just... off.

41. **Underestimated Empathy**: You care deeply but show it through tough love, which can sometimes land like a ton of bricks.

42. **Obsessed with Knowledge**: You dive deep into every topic but leave your friends gasping as they try to catch up.

43. **The Eternal Critic**: You always see room for improvement, but it can come off as you being never satisfied with anything.

44. **In-Your-Face Enthusiasm**: Your excitement for a project can make you come across more like a coach than a buddy.

45. **Permitted Snark**: You reserve snark for your closest friends, but they might not always find it endearing.

46. **High Standards**: Your expectations might be made of gold, and others feel like they’re always falling short.

47. **The Witty Comeback Artist**: You throw out zingers like they grow on trees, and keep everyone on their toes—some love it, others dread it.

48. **Pet Peeve Overload**: You have a list of pet peeves that you let everyone know about... every time.

49. **Wallflower Turned Star**: You were quiet for so long, and now that you’ve found your voice, everyone else feels like they’re fighting for the mic.

50. **The ‘Advice’ Giver**: You mean well with your advice, but it often lands as if you’re issuing a verdict rather than offering a helping hand.

In the end, we all have our moments and traits that could be perceived as annoying or “asshole-ish.” It’s all about finding that sweet spot between being true to yourself and being aware of how you come across to others! So, embrace the chaos, sprinkle in humor, and foster some empathy; it makes life a lot more fun!",1,1735553366.0,theassholeclub,0,1.0,False
1hpk5qz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1hpk5qz/the_last_shift/,The Last Shift ,"Emma had always been the type to finish her work, even if it meant staying late. It was nearing 11:00 PM, and the office was eerily silent, save for the hum of the fluorescent lights. Everyone else had gone hours ago, leaving her alone on the 12th floor of the towering corporate building. The city lights outside twinkled, a stark contrast to the dim, almost suffocating stillness inside.

As she typed away, the rhythmic clatter of her keyboard filled the empty space. She paused to stretch her neck and glanced at the clock. ""Just 30 more minutes,"" she muttered to herself, trying to shake off the unsettling feeling of being watched.

The feeling had been growing ever since the janitor had locked up earlier, wishing her a good night. At first, she chalked it up to her imagination. After all, late nights and silence could play tricks on anyone. But then she heard it—a faint click down the hall.

Emma froze, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. The sound was subtle, like the soft click of a door latch. She knew everyone had gone home, and she distinctly remembered hearing the janitor lock the main doors.

""Probably just the building settling,"" she told herself, though her heart was pounding.

She stood to investigate, armed only with her phone. The hallway was dimly lit, the motion-activated lights flickering on as she walked. The open-plan desks stretched out in rows, their computer screens dark and lifeless.

""Hello?"" she called out, her voice cracking slightly. No response.

She was about to turn back when she saw it—an office chair spinning slowly at one of the desks. She stared, frozen in place. There was no draft, no movement to explain it. The chair spun lazily, as if someone had just pushed it.

""Okay, this is ridiculous,"" she whispered, more to convince herself than anything. She approached the desk cautiously, her shoes clicking against the polished floor.

As she reached out to stop the chair, her phone buzzed violently in her hand. She yelped, nearly dropping it. A message flashed on the screen.

""You shouldn't be here.""

Her stomach dropped. The number was unknown. She spun around, scanning the empty office. The silence pressed down on her like a heavy blanket.

""Who's there?"" she demanded, trying to sound braver than she felt.

A loud thud came from the break room. Emma’s pulse raced as she turned toward the sound. The glass door to the break room was ajar, and the light inside flickered weakly.

She crept toward it, her hands trembling. The room was empty. At least, that’s what she thought until she saw the coffee pot. It was shattered on the floor, the dark liquid seeping into the tiles.

Her phone buzzed again. Another message.

""Behind you.""

Emma spun around, her scream catching in her throat. The hallway was empty. She stumbled back, clutching her phone. Her breath came in shallow gasps as she tried to process what was happening.

The lights in the office flickered violently, plunging the space into intermittent darkness. In the flashes of light, she saw it—an outline of a figure at the far end of the hall. Tall, unmoving, and watching.

Emma bolted. She didn’t care about her bag, her laptop, or the unfinished work. She sprinted for the elevator, slamming the button repeatedly. The doors opened painfully slow, and she threw herself inside, hitting the ground floor button.

As the elevator doors began to close, she saw the figure again. This time, it was closer, standing just outside the range of the flickering lights. Its head tilted unnaturally to the side, as if studying her.

The doors shut, and the elevator descended. Emma pressed herself against the wall, clutching her phone. She kept her eyes on the door, praying it wouldn’t stop before the lobby.

When the elevator finally dinged, she burst out into the empty lobby and ran straight for the exit. The night air hit her like a wave, and she didn’t stop running until she was several blocks away.

The next morning, Emma called in sick. She tried to convince herself it had been stress, a lack of sleep, or her imagination running wild.

But when she checked her phone, the messages were still there.

And so was a final one, sent at 3:00 AM.

""See you tonight.""

How to continue friendship with one of my bff's who has depression when I also need my cup filled after A YEAR OF BARELY SPEAKING.,"\*I wrote the below paragraph after typing ""I wanted to keep it brief"" lol I realize this was not brief but its as brief as I could get it.

I want to keep this brief because I know it can be tiring to read a huge essay of details. Would love to get more into it in the comments in case people want more details. The nuts & bolts of it is, in life I have often been the social butterfly and the one who checks in on people and reaches out to hang out more. Maybe others have a social circle already and new people are more like casual coffee hangs for them so they don't put in more effort or they don't need as much social interaction or theyre not as interested in me. I don't find the 3rd to be true often because I feel a lot of love and affection emenating from the people I initiate with. But I've always been more of the giver AND i'm in a phase of my life of actively finding and creating my tribe and community and that comes with finding both people that will be in your continuous communication circle and also those that love you but you may not talk to or meet often but I am looking for the more frequent close relationships right now. 

SO with that being said, its tough for me to continuously check in on my best friend since high school and for a year not see her or barely hear from her. She suffers from depression but has been undiagnosed and in the past we've had low communication spells and i know she's maybe not able to communicate much. but this was new and bad. it was a YEAR. and id check in each month and get variations of her saying shes sorry she can't respond shes not mentally feeling the best. and sometimes she'd ask about me or my life and i'd respond and hear nothing. it was basically the same cycle over and over of me checking in her saying sorry. i'd try sending funny memes tiktoks. and nothing. finally i got fed up and told her hey i love you we are family so i'm not going anywhere but we gotta talk about this cus i wanna help and i also wanna know what can we find that'll work for us that'll feel good for you AND i feel like i have a support system in you as well. she apologized and said she has been not able to reach out to anyone all year and is on meds now and will do better. that was 2-3 months ago. I replied back saying i'm so proud of her and if we could hop on the phone and chat. NOTHING. 

Came home for break recently and we got the whole gang back together for a hangout and she responded in our gc and showed up to our hang but didn't address her being mia all year really and i tried to allude to it hoping if i bring it up lighteharted/gently it'll give her space to  maybe just talk about it versus having the pressure of her having to address it on her own but instead nothing was really addressed. She filled us in on everything going on her life but didn't really address us and tell us like hey i know i wasn't reaching out to you guys or responding and i'm sorry or whatever something. Anyway, I feel upset and also i think tired/maybe burnt out. Maybe if I had a more robust social circle I'd feel less drained or sad from having to check in without expecting anything but its also that I miss my friend.

You make a free account which let's you track your progress in the in-game world.

You start out naked in a tree, or at maybe just in a jungle or heavily forested terrain on an island. You have no memory of how you got there. 

You can find items, do quests, defeat random monsters to earn money/items.

It was like Kingdom of Loathing but it wasn't that. Similar comedy, very tongue and cheek writing style, very wacky narrator voice most of the time.

A few particular memories stand out to me: You can quickly find your way to a village with a bunch of stuff to do. 

I remember there's a movie theater with a very long and peculiar movie your character can keep '""watching"" in that you are reading a very long but descriptive scene of a man doing things on screen. 

There's a doctor who can heal you fully but it costs a decent amount of the games money and he also has med students who can heal you based on % chance of success for less money. It's very funny if you choose to be healed by a med-student and not the doctor.

There's also a choice quest early on in sort of a beginner zone, where you can choose to help a woman who is in a similar starting situation to what you had to go through. Where you can help her learn the ropes, give her some of your resources... or not. I think she offers you a coffee and the two of you catch up the next time you run into her, assuming you help her the first time.

I hope all that helps. I cannot for the life of me remember what the game is called!

I’ve tried to cut myself off but the headaches are absolutely horrific, to the point I’m in tears with it and having a pup, a cat and a small human to care for, taking a few days off in bed  isn’t an option. 

I can’t drink caffeinate tea or coffee for some reason, they stress my kidney out. Doctors don’t understand it either. 

I need to come off these redbull, does anyone have any advice on how to do it? I’ve tried cutting down to one can but the headache starts at nighttime before bed if I do that so I’m at a loss

For context , prior to asking for their contacts , one of them was grinding on me at the club I then asked her for her contacts and she gave it immediately - I left to another corner of the club. The other one noticed and came - passed close to me with a girlfriend, and tapped me on the shoulder to notice her (winked and waved). I didn’t follow as I assumed she was headed to the toilet. I instead positioned myself to see her location when she left the toilet. On her way out much later I smiled again at her and asked for her contact - she gave it to me and kissed me on the cheek. 

Now I screwed things up already as I messaged one of them and didn’t leave my name in the contact(my profile picture is on my gram profile - I just said “hi met you at abc and it was nice meeting you”). I didn’t message the one who kissed me (the hotter one). 

Is it too late as I messaged one who hasn’t responded and for next time if this is blown how long do I wait and what is the best opening line for a first message.

At home I rarely have privacy. My son's room is next door and he hears everything. I can only create content quietly in my bedroom. Now I have this huge 3 bedroom condo with a big balcony overlooking the Atlantic Ocean with golden hour sunrise and sunset views. I've brought lingerie corsets, bikinis high heels etc. filled my whole truck with stuff.  Nothing is happening except food and TV.  I did swim in the heated salt water pool while tornado- like weather rolled by. Of course didn't film that but the experience was amazing.

If you had the freedom to almost do anything as a solo Creator what would be something you would do? I thought about doing some sexy kitchen stuff but instead of dressing in a cute outfit and wearing high heels, I'm microwaving leftover pizza with the chips and dip. If you could give suggestions I'd really appreciate the motivation. My brain is definitely not working --too much starch and sugar right now with coffee filled in throughout the day.

One goal I've made and it is a subscriber request is to create some flashing videos on the beach. That will be easy peasy cuz there's usually no one there and I set up umbrellas for privacy. it's supposed to be sunny and nice today too so that's a win-win but there will be beer drinking so my zest for creating will dwindle.

Long discussion and she explains she's not over her ex completely so she cannot commit etc.

She also explains how she does not go into relations unless she can say i love you beforehand.

My bff tells me to run. That no one does this. And I'm being led on.
I tried to end things cause I'm just confused and for me a relation could already start. but everytime i stay cause she convinced me it's just a different vision. 

We also planned a small trip mid jan. But she explicitly said it doesn't mean anything. Like it's not a relationship test etc.

Also never met any of her friends so far. When trying to end things last night she said she'll have a coffee or smth with me and her friend in Jan...

EDIT - One more detail. She organized new years at her place. With her friends. I was not invited because it's "" too significant of an event "" to be invited. And so too clarify. She explicitly didn't want me to meet her friends these 3 months. Only now when i wanted to end things. She said i can have a coffee or something with one of her friends.

So. I want to know if i should end it or believe her and continue this limbo?

I wanna end it but at the same time i like her and understand she has a different vision of relations.


I can answer any questions ofc but that's the jist of 
It. Any advice would be great. Thanks.",3,1735551768.0,relationship_advice,15,1.0,False
1hpjs0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1hpjs0q/how_to_invest_in_timeless_furniture_pieces_that/,"How to Invest in Timeless Furniture Pieces That Last a Lifetime
","Investing in timeless furniture is more than just a financial decision—it’s a commitment to quality, design, and sustainability. Whether you’re furnishing a new home or updating your space, timeless pieces bring lasting beauty and functionality to your interiors. Here’s a guide to help you choose [house furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) that will stand the test of time and effortlessly adapt to changing trends.

# 1. Prioritize Quality Materials

The foundation of timeless furniture is durable, high-quality materials. Solid wood, natural fibers, and metals are classic choices that age gracefully. For instance, a [rattan coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/ava-rattan-coffee-table) adds warmth and texture while offering exceptional longevity. Look for pieces crafted with precision and attention to detail, as they often indicate superior craftsmanship.

**Pro Tip:** Avoid overly trendy finishes or materials that may go out of style. Opt for neutral tones and classic textures that complement various aesthetics.

# 2. Focus on Functional Designs

Functionality is key to timelessness. Choose furniture with designs that serve a clear purpose and can adapt to your needs over time. For example, extendable dining tables or stackable chairs are practical options that retain their charm for years.

**Best Bet:** If you’re searching for [dining chairs in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/dining-room-furniture/dining-chairs), look for styles with ergonomic designs and durable upholstery. Upholstered dining chairs with clean lines and neutral fabrics are a classic choice that pairs well with any table style.

# 3. Invest in Versatile Pieces

Timeless furniture often works well across different rooms and design styles. Pieces like armoires, benches, and sideboards can seamlessly transition between bedrooms, living rooms, and dining areas.

**Style Idea:** **Bar chairs in Dubai** are not just for kitchen islands or bars. Choose elegant designs with sturdy materials, and you can repurpose them for outdoor entertaining or as stylish seating in your home office.

# 4. Embrace Iconic Furniture Styles

Certain furniture designs have stood the test of time for a reason. Mid-century modern, Scandinavian, and classic English styles often feature clean lines, balanced proportions, and minimal ornamentation, making them enduring choices.

**Example:** A **rattan coffee table** inspired by mid-century aesthetics can effortlessly fit into a bohemian, coastal, or even modern interior, proving its versatility and timeless appeal.

# 5. Opt for Neutral Colors and Classic Patterns

Timeless furniture rarely relies on bold patterns or trendy colors to make a statement. Neutral hues like beige, gray, white, and natural wood tones create a clean and versatile base for any space. Add personality with accessories like throws, cushions, and rugs that can be updated over time.

**Design Tip:** When buying **house furniture**, focus on neutral finishes for larger pieces, like sofas and dining tables, and introduce color through smaller accents.

# 6. Choose Pieces with Emotional Value

Timeless furniture often has a story. Look for handcrafted or artisan pieces that reflect heritage, tradition, or innovative design. Items like a bespoke dining table or intricately woven **rattan coffee table** bring character to your home while supporting sustainable practices.

**Local Tip:** Dubai offers a wealth of high-quality artisan furniture. Explore local markets or specialty stores for unique **dining chairs in Dubai** that combine craftsmanship with timeless style.

# 7. Maintain and Preserve Your Furniture

Investing in timeless pieces is only half the story; maintaining them is crucial for longevity. Regular cleaning, polishing, and reupholstering can keep your furniture looking its best for decades.

**Care Idea:** Use protective pads under heavy furniture to avoid scratches on wooden floors, and clean natural materials like rattan or wood with non-abrasive cleaners to preserve their texture and finish.

# Why Choose Timeless Furniture?

* **Sustainability:** Fewer replacements reduce waste, making timeless furniture a sustainable choice.
* **Value:** High-quality pieces often retain their value and even become heirlooms.
* **Flexibility:** Timeless furniture adapts to evolving trends and lifestyles.

# Where to Find Timeless Furniture in Dubai

Dubai is a hub for high-quality, stylish furniture that caters to diverse tastes. From minimalist Scandinavian designs to artisan-crafted [bar chairs Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/bar-stools), the city offers countless options for every aesthetic. If you're looking for **house furniture** with a blend of functionality and style, explore both local and international brands in Dubai’s many furniture showrooms.

Whether it’s elegant **dining chairs in Dubai** for your next family gathering or a versatile **rattan coffee table** that complements any decor, investing in timeless furniture ensures your home stays stylish and welcoming for years to come.

Ilie stayed at the table, practicing his sums, while Mama went to see who was calling. A little later, Mama returned, followed by Mrs. Feinman. Jimmy was trailing after.

The sight of his friend made Ilie's still bruised nose ache.

""Ilie, dear,"" Mrs. Feinman said, ""Jimmy has something he'd like to say.""

Ilie put aside his work and shifted around on the chair to look at Jimmy. Jimmy, who was half-hiding behind Mrs. Feinman like a scared baby.

""Well?"" Mrs. Feinman said, and stepped away, then urged Jimmy forward.

Sighing, Jimmy fished a folded paper out of his pocket.

""Dear Ilie I am sorry I hit you and we fought. It was mean and rude and I promise to not ever do it again. And I promise not to brag always about Christmas presents and things.""

Ilie frowned. He had really mostly not thought about the fight since a few days ago. Oh, if his nose hurt suddenly or something he remembered, but he had been sort of distracted.

""Ilie,"" his mama said, ""do you have some things you need to say to Jimmy?""

Oh. Mama and Papa had said this was important. Sliding from the chair, Ilie stood and nodded.

""I'm sorry we fought, Jimmy. I was bein' rude too that day. I don't mind you talk about Christmas. I just was in a real bad mood, and I was mean from it. I don't want ever to fight again, because you're my friend. I'm real sorry.""

Jimmy had folded his apology back into his pocket, and now he walked up and gave Ilie a hug. Ilie hugged him back and was glad maybe the fight was over. He missed spending time with Jimmy.

After all the apologising was over, Mrs. Feinman checked Ilie's nose again, as she had every other day since the fight.

""Definitely healing well, thank God,"" she said.

Then the boys were told they could go and play quietly in the front room a while, so they did. Papa had brought Ilie a little deck of cards, and the boys sat and had a few games of rummy before Mama, coffee cup in hand, stepped through and got their attention.

""Ilie, you go meet your papa at the corner, all right?""

""Can Jimmy come along?""

""He can if he promises to behave,"" Mrs. Feinman called.

""Ah, gee, Ma,"" Jimmy muttered.

""James Andrew Donnelly...""

""I promise, Ma. I promise.""

Ilie put his cards away, and both boys grabbed their coats, then suffered the indignity of their mamas wrapping their mufflers around their necks and faces before racing down to the street.

""I am real sorry,"" Jimmy said later as the boys stepped onto the pavement and headed for the corner.

""Me too,"" Ilie said.

They got to the corner just as Ilie's Papa arrived, and he grinned at them.

""Well, well. What's this, I got two bandits come to hold me up today?""

""Papa, it's just me an' Jimmy!"" Ilie squealed, tugging his muffler down.

""Ah, well, thank you for telling me. I'm glad it's you boys. Here, help me with this.""

It was Wednesday, so Papa had the growler. This he handed to Ilie, who carried it like a precious treasure. Jimmy got to carry part of the leftover food Papa brought.

""You boys make up from your fight?"" Papa asked.

""Yes,"" the boys chorused, and Papa smiled as he patted them each on the back.

""That's good. No one wants to be angry this time of year.""

so to start off our GM is really harsh. if we do something wrong she is on our ASS and calls it coaching but it’s just being mean. anyway, so we have deli meat we slice and portion out, turkey and ham. each portion is supposed to be 2 ounces, no less no over. most of us don’t get completely exact, 1.9 to 2.2. well the other day, ALL the ham was portioned out to 3 to 3.5 ounces. the other cooks told me not to tell the GM, so i said ok i won’t, cuz i didn’t wanna get yelled at. 

i accidentally told her 😭 the ham cold cut was super big and i was like omg  it’s so big!! and she was doing foh expo and asked if the meat was over and i went 😟.

she then got REALLY upset and yelled at us, telling us to reportion ALL of it. which meant we had to pull the meat out of each bag and re-weigh it.

y’all the other cooks were SOOO FREAKING MAD AT ME!! giving me NASTY looks, literaly disregarding me!! one of them went “i told you not to say anything 😒” then when the GM asked if there was any more portioned ham in the walk in (there was) they CUT OVER ME and said no. 

they’re all in their 20s, there’s another teenage cook but i rarely see him cuz he’s still in high school so he works evenings. 

like look i understand not wanting to get yelled at, but the more i think about it the more i get irritated that they got mad at me for saying something. this is one of multiple times where ive told the GM about something quality control wise and they get all petty.

being a teenage girl in a kitchen is NOT FOR THE WEAK!! nobody will take u serious and will ALWAYS get mad at you for something. ",0,1735550805.0,KitchenConfidential,16,0.38,False

Ab jitne contestants bache hain unhi ke hisaab se ranking kar raha hoon. Ye meri personal opinion hai, aur ranking votes ya BB ke interference se badal bhi sakti hai (jaise DV ko bahar kiya gaya).

# 9. Shrutika

Mujhe Shrutika ka zyada contribution nahi dikh raha. Uski journey mostly Baggu aur Chum ke around hi chal rahi hai. Na entertaining lagi, na koi impactful mudda uthaaya. Honestly, kuch zyada bolne ko hai hi nahi.

# 8. Kashish

Wildcard hone ka thoda disadvantage mila Kashish ko. Abhi tak usne koi strong rishta nahi banaya, but apne muddo mein aur dusron ke muddo mein usually right hoti hai. For example, Diggy vs Chugli gang wale mudde mein VD ko baad mein right bataya, aur Avinash-KV ke trimmer wale mudde mein bhi sahi thi. Lekin entertaining factor missing hai aur late entry ki wajah se uski journey baakiyon se chhoti lagi. Mujhe kaafi sahi lagi kashish jisdin vo aayi thi usdin uski fight with Eisha(rula diya tha sachmein).

# 7. Chahat Pandey

Kaafi sahi contestant h , suru se laghbhag dikhti hi h , Rishton mein thoda kacchi h kyunki rishtey ban ni paaye chahat ke (diigy se bane vo nikal gaya). Avinash , vivian darte h chahat se.Baaki mujhe to sahi h lagi suru se h caahi ladki h.

# 6. Chum

Starting mein laga tha ye bandi 2-3 weeks mein evict ho jayegi, but she outperformed. Positive hai, strong rishte hain, aur tasks mein Rajat se bhi better perform kiya hai. Mudde bhi utha leti hai, lekin koi usse ladne ko ready nahi rehta. Entertaining bhi hai (Chumveer angle kaafi chal raha hai), aur uski personality real lagi. Contribution overall accha raha hai.

# 5. Eisha

Mujhe pata hai log bolenge ki Eisha ne kuch nahi kiya, but Bigg Boss ki ladli hone ka fayda mila hai. Screen time kaafi zyada hai aur har jagah baatein hoti hi hain. Avi aur Eisha ka angle bhi sahi chal raha hai. Relationships bane hain, mudde uthaye hain, aur positivity (Khud hi bola h ""E in Eisha is Evil"") dikhayi hai. Personality bhi showcase ho chuki hai.

# 4. Vivian

Laadla, got the high screen time and suru se vivian-rajmaata-karan angle all time high raha h. Coffee , karan ko apni dish khilana iske alava jyada khuch h ni.

# 3. Rajat

Sara ke alawa kisi ke saath strong rishte nahi bane, but entertainment diya hai bhar ke(shayari aur comedy). 80% personality real lagi aur mudde accha uthaye hain. Planning aur strategy ke maamle mein strong hai, lekin fake relationships banana sirf game ke liye (samikaran ke liye) winner quality nahi lagti.

# 2. Avinash

Dil ka accha banda hai, lekin game ke liye characters pakde huye hain (In KV voice). Relationships banaye hain, mudde hamesha spotlight mein rakhne ki koshish karta hai, aur weekend ka vaar us par centered hota hai. Entertainment diya hai (mimicry achhi karta hai), love angle bhi le aaya, aur personality showcase ho gayi hai.

# 1. Karan

Rishte, mudde, love angle, screen time, entertainment, personality, aur task performance sab kuch hai. Eden task ke alawa koi solid endurance task nahi diya gaya BB mein, lekin jitna mila usme achha perform kiya. Game planning karta hai, lekin team ke dumb moves usse drag karte hain. Overall, Winning material h.

# Shilpa Ji ko kyun nahi rank kiya?

Kyunki mujhe nahi lagta ki wo top 8 (ya top 100) mein deserve karti hain.

Agar voting ke basis pe winner decide hoga to Rajat easily jeet jayega, kyunki North India ke berozgaar (Pelvis ke subscribers ki baat karra hu) uske liye vote karenge.

However, over the last week the wand is just heating up the milk without producing any froth. Basically, it seems as if the wand gives us the same result whether we have pulled it down to the ""Cappuccino"" setting or up to the ""Hot Milk"" setting.

The machine has never given us issues before and we've always de-scaled it using the official DeLonghi de-scaler. Not flashing lights or any other warning from the machine, which makes me suspect that it is a hardware issue related to the wand itself.

So i´ve finished college recently and manage to nail my first corporate job this year.

For context i only work with older women, in their 55's. Recently a finance dep closed and the team that was there had to move to the office where I'm currently working right now.

And then she arrived, at first everything was going great, got to meet new people and everything was going well. Then she started being a little flirty with me, which at first i kind of just ignored since i just couldn't be like that in the environment we were it was just weird.  
But then things just rushed pretty quick, she asked for my Instagram, we started being together even after work hours (but still in the company). And then we escalated to meeting with each other outside of work.

The tricky part is that we do lots of sexual jokes, even one day we texted until 4 a.m, and i know i can blame myself for letting go like this. But even after this night, we still meet for coffee a few days later. My delusional mind really started to get attached to her. The morning after our ""date"", out of nowhere she started being very dry and taking hours to reply and with that i just stopped replying.

Yesterday i saw her in the bar where we went and we basically just pretended we didn't saw each other.

Look i know i might be overreacting or being insecure, but wow am i going to deal with this in a few days after new years eve? Should i try to talk with her about this? I ask this because i did got feelings for her and i think we overall had a great chemistry.   
  
Besides that, work was really starting to get pretty nice because i had someone in my age range to talk to, instead of earing my co-workers talking about their kids and which color they painted their house.

It showed me how I'm still holding myself back into some cishet normative stuff. Like, since I've been working on myself for years now, I feel happier about myself than ever and I've been a lot more confident in approaching people randomly, or initiating discussions on dating apps. But that's the thing, I'm the one initiating. I'm the one having to push for someone to look back at me. Being depended on as the ""man"" of the relationship who constantly leads, which I thought I was okay with back when I dated as a guy, and I'm realizing that isn't something I want anymore now that I'm putting serious effort into dating as a girl. Not all the time anyways, certainly not in my ideal relationship. And I'm especially more aware that this is the box I'm being forced into at times as a sapphic trans woman.

But, I've also had enough free premium trials of HER to go through the entire 90 mile radius of more dominant and top leaning women. That's with me being in a pretty queer area, and my biggest matches are with gals looking to be more passive and led in a relationship, especially in the bedroom area.

So, I'm at a point where I'm ready to give up entirely on dating apps and throw my load into meeting people IRL. But like...how do I present myself in a way that gets others to look at me and take initiative first? I mean, I'm certainly okay taking initiative, even first; I'm still absolutely gonna compliment cute girls I pass in public. But, it's extremely rare that I am approached in that manner, and if I am, it's often just ""Oh your hair looks great!"" Which yes, I love, and can be a good starting point, but it's often in transactional interactions, not random personal ones.

A few things I've already been thinking of and am going to do:

* Dress a LOT more fem. I've been a t-shirt and black pants wearer since first puberty. I added arm warmers and thigh highs shortly after beginning my transition, and love that style. But this next year, I'm going to actually start filling my wardrobe with dresses and skirts that I can feel comfortable wearing in public. And then actually wear them on my more extroverted days. (I'm a natural ambivert.)
* Put a lesbian flag pin/sticker on my bag in a very visible spot. Just a way to signal to others where I swing, in hopes it rises more confidence from compatible people approaching me.
* Hang out in public places more, like the popular college town coffee shop. This also means not having headphones on as much, or at least only keeping one in instead of both.
* Actually socialize with the people in my upper bachelors and grad school classes these last few years of school, instead of keeping to myself because that's how I operate in an academic setting.

But when I came across the concept of **hydrogen water bottles**, I got curious. Could adding molecular hydrogen to water really make a difference? I decided to give the **LifeWater Hydrogen Water Bottle** a try, and after a few weeks, I’m here to share what I’ve learned.

# What Does a LifeWater Bottle Do?

The **lifewater hydrogen bottle** takes regular water and infuses it with molecular hydrogen through a process called electrolysis. This hydrogen-rich water is believed to offer benefits beyond basic hydration:

* **Improved hydration** at the cellular level.
* **Reduced inflammation** for those dealing with joint pain or chronic conditions.
* **Enhanced energy levels** without caffeine or stimulants.
* **Better skin clarity** and hydration.
* **Faster recovery** after workouts or physical activity.

It’s not about changing the taste or look of the water—it’s about enhancing how your body uses it.

# How Do You Use It?

Using the **lifewater water bottle** couldn’t be easier:

1. Fill the bottle with water (filtered, bottled, or tap).
2. Press the button on the base to activate the hydrogen infusion.
3. Wait three minutes for the process to complete.
4. Drink immediately to enjoy the benefits.

# What I’ve Noticed

After a few weeks of regular use, here are the main changes I’ve observed:

1. **Better hydration**: I feel more refreshed and need to drink less to stay hydrated.
2. **Subtle energy boost**: My afternoons feel less sluggish, and I’ve cut down on coffee.
3. **Improved recovery**: After workouts, I feel less sore and recover faster.
4. **Clearer skin**: My skin feels more hydrated and looks brighter.

The changes aren’t dramatic, but they’re enough to make me stick with it.

# Who Is It For?

The **LifeWater Hydrogen Water Bottle** is great for:

* **Athletes**: It helps with hydration and recovery.
* **People with inflammation**: Conditions like arthritis or gout may see benefits.
* **Busy professionals**: It’s a natural way to boost energy.
* **Skin-conscious individuals**: The antioxidant properties can support better skin health.

# Final Thoughts

The **LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle** hasn’t completely transformed my life, but it’s made noticeable improvements to my hydration, energy, and overall well-being. If you’re curious about hydrogen water, this bottle is a simple and convenient way to try it out.

Just wanted to start this out by saying that I am not a social worker - sorry if this post is inappropriate, but I figured some of you may understand what I’m going through.

I work at a sexual assault center as a Volunteer Coordinator, and I assist in covering our 24/7 crisis hotline for telephonic emotional support, or sometimes to report to our local ER to accompany someone who needs a forensic exam. Being that the program is 24/7, I’ll sometimes get calls in the middle of the night from people who need support.

When I get these late calls, I always have such a hard time going back to sleep after I speak with them because I get in work mode and I’m unable to turn it off. I have PTSD myself and have a hard time sleeping anyways, so the thought that I could get another call at any time gets me antsy and I feel like I drank like 3 cups of coffee.

1hpj80r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1hpj80r/how_is_psychiatry_trying_to_improve_interviewing/,"How is psychiatry trying to improve interviewing patients and families when they don’t have language around mental health, or recognition of what is “normal”?  It is like we speak a different language - but no one is available to translate so far.","**I feel like 2 major factors prevented me from having the right treatment early on as well as the right diagnosis:**   
  
**1. Unawareness of What’s ""Abnormal""**  
I didn’t realize many of my symptoms were ""abnormal,"" and neither did my family. Even now, I sometimes struggle to recognize when I’m unwell. For example, how could I tell people that I had ""strange or unusual beliefs"" when they didn’t feel strange to me? They felt like facts. How was my family supposed to recognize that me walking all night long wasn’t just a quirky habit, or that my messy room and inability to keep track of anything—even though I was a straight-A student—wasn't just laziness or the ""absent-minded professor"" stereotype?

**2.    My family and I didn't understand the meaning behind a lot of the mental health terminology, so we didn't endorse or deny symptoms accurately.**

* Example 1: ""Hypersexuality"" -  *Do you ever experience periods of intense hypersexuality where it has interfered with your relationships or work?*  Me: ""Nope, don't think so."" Internal thought process:  *""That's never been an issue.  If I get horny and my boyfriend is done after a couple of rounds, I will just masturbate for the rest of the night.  I mean, sometimes it can be painful because it goes on way too long but that is more a fetish thing, right?  Plus, it never interferes with work because I would never do it if I need the sleep.  I only do it when I don't need to sleep.""*
* Example 2:  ""Decreased Need for Sleep""  - *Do you ever struggle with insomnia?* Never have I had an issue with insomnia.  Now, do I ever go through periods when I barely sleep?  Sure.  But I could sleep if I had any desire to do so, but I don't have any need to do so.  Why would anyone sleep if they don't feel the need to sleep?  So did I endorse this symptom?  Nope.
* Example 3: ""Suicidality vs Intrusive Thoughts""  I would go to Doctors, Therapists, Psychiatrists reporting suicidality - but I wasn't suicidal.  I eventually developed actual suicidality, but for a good decade I struggled with intrusive thoughts of self-harm.  People would tell us in school or whatever that if you have thoughts of suicide, tell someone.  So I would.  The questions would be like, ""Do you feel like you would actually intend to die?""  *Um ya, my brain just told me to jump in front of a f-ing train, I am pretty sure it intends to kill me!*  It was years, and MANY mental health professionals later before someone thought to ask, ""Hey, do these thoughts feel like they come from you or from somewhere or someone else?""  Turns out they were intrusive thoughts.  
* Example 4: ""Emotional Dysregulation"" -  When my family was asked if I was moody, irritable, or hostile, they said, ""Definitely!"" But no one asked, ""Is this her usual state, or has it only been for the past month?"" During crises, I was moody and hostile, but my baseline personality was easygoing and quick to laugh. The context was completely missed.



In many of the instances I can't blame the mental health professionals for not digging deeper or not explaining each term in depth. Well, in a couple of instances it was definitely their fault - saying I have abandonment issues because I was worried my bf would leave me when he had just cheated on me a couple of months before with zero explanation as to why, or saying I had traits of a dependent personality disorder when I went to the psychiatrist worried that I was too dependent on my bf because I was so depressed that I wasn't working and he was paying the bills is not dependent personality disorder - especially given the context that I was the one who traditionally did everything from applying to university, moving, arranging for rental leases, online banking, accessing medical care, etc. completely independently as soon as I hit 18 (or earlier, in some cases).  I had just been super depressed for a few months, and my major concern was that I could not longer be the independent person I once was.  But generally, it wasn't the mental health provider's fault.  More than once I had been assessed in the ER by some random psychiatrist that was on call at 3 am, and the psychiatrist would be like, ""She's fine, just experiencing emotional reactivity"" but they would do a courtesy call to my psychiatrist (who I am sure just loved being woken up in the middle of the night at home on a night when he wasn't on call) and he would be like, ""Please ask her if she thinks she is some kind of Scandinavian god and whether she is feeling emotional because she doesn't want to die but knows that is the only way she can follow through on Thor's mission.   If she thinks that or gets super defensive and hostile, admit her.  If she will openly discuss it and say definitively that she does not think that, she is ok to go home"".  Lo and behold, I was crazy.  I didn't know to tell them that because to me it made perfect sense and it wasn't an ""unusual belief"" at all.  It was fact.  The only reason my psychiatrist stumbled over it was because at one point I asked him if the reason he was assigned to me when I was admitted to the hospital the first time was because he was of Icelandic descent and if so, could I even trust him?  No one would know to ask about that, so I don't blame the system for missing it repeatedly. 

But really, in most instances it was just issues around miscommunication, misinterpretation or misunderstanding.  But these misunderstandings can have major consequences, from years of incorrect treatment to no treatment at all. It’s similar to the time my best friend's British fiancé asked me for a ""rubber"" (eraser), and I thought he was making an inappropriate proposition. That was funny; my mental health miscommunications were not.

I know in my own field it happens - I was helping a parent complete some medical forms for their child, and one was an ADHD screener.  I knew their child well, and they could check off EVERY single box on that screener as ""Almost Always"".  I read through the form, using exactly the standardized language required, and she kept saying, ""Oh, but that is boys, am I right?  My brothers were just like that!  So put rarely for that one.  Oh and that one too.  He never does it in a way that it is outside the norm!""  I kept trying to explain that it isn't up to her to determine whether it is ""outside the norm"", but it is whether he does it at all, but family members often don't understand that and I bet patients sometimes don't either.  Even myself: over the years I have completed many screeners that said things like ""Have you ever heard voices that other people couldn’t hear?"" or ""Do you ever hear voices that command you to do things?"".  Well, other than a couple of times nearly two decades ago I heard voices externally, but outside of that I don't *hear* voices. There are extra conversations happening in my head that don't belong to me, but other than the intrusive thoughts that would try to command me to do things, these voices don't.  They are just like incomprehensible murmurs like background noise in a coffee shop, or if I understood them they were just chatting about random stuff that had nothing to with me, like ""Wow, that sociology textbook was fascinating!""  ""I love wearing that shirt with the purple polka dots - so cute!""... I mean, I hadn't ever read anything about sociology, and I didn't own anything with purple polka dots, and I didn't *hear* these voices, they were inside my head.   I assumed they must be some kind of mental process, but how was I supposed to know it wasn't normal?  They weren't voices of anyone I knew, they weren't relevant to me at all, so I just figured everyone's brain did that.  

  


**So how is psychiatry working to overcome this issue?  How can they make the language accessible in a way that doesn't allow for significant misinterpretation that will result in a completely wrong treatment or diagnosis?  How can they ensure that patients or patient's families haven't unintentionally normalized behaviours or patterns simply because someone has done that ""thing"" since early adulthood or late adolescence?**  ",2,1735549265.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

Now, a lot of people have a problem with how he writes jaune, making him OOC (out if character) seeing that most of his work are around Jaune. We'll, I'm here to kinda explain how I personally see it.
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

First, Coeur doesn't make Jaune do anything out of charater,  most of them are just Jaune in a different situation then canon, which natural will make him make different decisions. Now the problem people have are with how he acts.
 
 



For example in professor arc(Jaune fake transcript is so good Ozpin takes him as a teacher) is simply one of Jaune’s quirks amplified,  he takes something unique about jaune(fake transcript) and crank it up to 10×, instead of a student, he's a teacher, which also played on him lying to everyone, resulting in almost everything that happened in that fic, simply by making a small thing about his character bigger. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Same with not this time fate (jaune goes back in time each time he dies) and null (go read it), where jaune Vengeance and protectiveness is amplified, resulting in a ruthless Jaune who'll do anything for the people he loves, similar to when Jaune was on a war path against Cinder.
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
Service with a smile (jaune is rejected from Beacon and open a coffee shop) where is civil side take center stage, while his friendliness helps with making friends. 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
Second choice (Jaune join Atlas and meets penny) where he's more of a team leader leading people. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Each fic takes an aspect of jaune and runs with it, which is why people think jaune is ooc while he's actually acting in character.

It’s been a little after just a single month and I can barely think, energy is lower than it has ever been. What aside from Coffee (which doesn’t even work at this point even the highly caffeinated stuff) and illegal drugs does everyone use to stay awake? I know she’s little, I know this is going to happen for quite a while longer but due to sleep deprivation things are getting a little tense. To be honest, at this point I was hoping to be somewhat accustomed or used to things but it’s just getting worse and she’s not even two months. How do people have more than one child? How do you function without sleep? Am I doing something wrong? We feel like we are going insane. Now I start to get completely anxious and sometimes nauseous when it gets dark because I know no rest is coming, and the idea of the next couple of months or god forbid another year of no rest is not to be dramatic but nothing short of haunting. 

Also just to vent but whenever I meet someone and I hear, “say goodbye to sleep and rest!” Even in a joking manner makes me want to vomit. ",3,1735549160.0,NewParents,1,1.0,False

He’s a lovable guy, very talented, everyone that meets him loves him. But he is very manipulative and a user and has been using me for years. He doesn’t let me have individual access to money and continues to dig us into debt and foils any plan I have to leave. He is also very jealous of me. 

My mom and my sister and I had a spa day planned at a hotel and they upgraded our room for free. I planned and saved for this. I sent him a video of the suite and asked “how much was that?” I said “idk I didn’t book this” not realizing he was keeping a tab on my spending. The night ended up costing $300 for my share of the hotel room, dinner and breakfast in the hotel, wine, my spa treatments and products I bought at the spa. I come home and he tells me he was upset that I was out and he wasn’t so he went to a restaurant and spend $200 himself. When I tell him that was irresponsible he gives me the silent treatment and wants me to apologize for being “mean” but I want being mean. I was being honest. And I told him that I was sorry it hurt your feelings, but I meant what I said. He ignored me for 2 days. 

Today he decided to mount his PS5. We spent a lot of money making our apartment look nice and I asked him if he could put his PS5 in our study or conceal it somehow or at least manage the wires, have a place for the controllers instead of the couch/coffee table. He mounted it but it was the wrong way so It looked terrible with more wires. And I told him it looked bad. He got upset and threatened to throw his PS5 away, which would be a win for me, but I suggested he just fix it or hire someone but he said he couldn’t afford to and I just needed to get used to it. But I said absolutely not, I deserve a home that looks nice so we can compromise by having you make it look nicer. He said I was being “mean” and I again apologized for hurting his feelings, but it wasn’t a good job and he’d just have to be mad if it makes him mad. Now he’s not letting me sleep, he keeps coming in and out turning on lights and talking on the phone after 2am and not speaking to me. 

I’m at the end of my rope. Is this abuse? These small instances of silent treatments and reckless spending stack up and I just want to be alone, I’m considering divorce. I’m afraid to leave because he has $50k in credit card debt and I can’t afford to take that on, stay in our apartment, and have even a shot at a good life.

Honestly, I didn’t expect much, but it’s now become something I carry with me everywhere.

Here’s why:

1. **Natural Relief:** It clears my sinuses almost instantly, but what’s great is that it doesn’t have that overly medicinal smell like other inhalers. The natural, subtle scents are refreshing without being overwhelming.
2. **Energy Boost:** I’ve been using it during those mid-afternoon slumps, and it’s like a reset button. A quick inhale, and I feel more awake and focused, without needing another coffee.
3. **Stress Relief:** This is a big one for me. I tend to get stressed easily, and the calming scents (mine’s peppermint) really help me take a breather—literally.
4. **Portable and Convenient:** It’s tiny, so it’s easy to keep in my pocket or bag. I even use it during commutes or before meetings when I need a quick pick-me-up.

I think what I love most is that it feels cleaner and more natural than anything I’ve used before. No strong chemicals, just a nice, refreshing way to clear my head and feel better.

If you’ve ever felt drained during the day or just needed something to help you de-stress, I’d say give an organic nasal inhaler a try. I didn’t think I’d be writing about one on Reddit, but hey, it’s been a pleasant little life upgrade!",2,1735548950.0,GentlemanNCo,0,1.0,False

I use Native Amber, and Oak body wash as well as deodorant as a base, and a lotion by Sand and Fog Moroccan amber on combined with Shea butter by Alaffia.

Does anyone know if there is a warm scent that would work with the stated soaps, and lotions. That has the sharpness of Alien Mugglier, the Gourmet sophistication of Replica Coffee Break as well as Yves Saint Laurent’s Black Opium, and the warmth of Nehmat Amber.  Something with a woodsy dry down.

For the record I would wear this perfume out, and about. I live in a place with many open air markets, and environments you’re never truly enclosed here so the scent can be a tad impactful but I wouldn’t want anyone who is not standing directly next to me to smell it.

It’s a screened compost so the particle size is 1/8” down to fine dust. It’s also relatively dry at the time of bagging (doesn’t clump or ball up). We’re  using side gusseted bags like those commonly used for coffee, filled with about 1.5kg of product. 

I’ve looked around and am fairly confident that an auger filler is the best option for this type of product but wanted to get some second opinions. I’ve also considered vibratory fillers but am under the impression that the auger filler will be faster and that vibratory fillers are better with coarser/non-dusty materials. 

Another thing I’m contemplating is the merit of volumetric filling. Technically we say each bag contains 4 quarts. However, for quality control purposes I’ve been weighing 4 quarts of product and then filling by weight. With a homogeneous product that can be sampled and weighed with each batch, is there really any point to volumetric filling?

Basically, you do surveys to earn points, and you can cash out once you have enough. Plus, they have a few bonus features to boost your earnings, which makes it a bit more interesting!

  
PS. I am very close to reach my first 50 dollars target. I will create another post when I've reached that target. If there would be any problem to get that gift or not. I plan to spend that money on Temu if it is possible. Happy new year to everyone !!!

**Earn Money by Taking Surveys**  
The main thing here is the surveys. They’re usually pretty quick and straightforward, and you earn points for each one you complete. I’ve been doing them during coffee breaks—it’s a nice way to feel productive and earn a little something on the side! ☕💸

**Earn by Playing Games: A Mix of Fun and Frustration 🤨**  
Prime Opinion actually lets you earn by playing games too, which is cool, but fair warning: some of these games can be a bit unpredictable with rewards. Some are worth it, while others make you work a little harder than I’d like. But hey, if you like gaming, it’s another way to earn while having fun. 🎮🕹️

**Weekly Raffles: Win Up to 1,000 Points! 🎁**  
If you’re consistent and do at least one survey every day for seven days, you get entered into a raffle. Last time, I won 500 points (roughly $5), which covered my coffee costs for the week! ☕ Not a bad deal, so I try to keep up with the streak.

**Leveling Up: Unlock Extra Perks 📈**  
There’s a level system too, which makes it feel a bit like a game. Each time you level up, you unlock features and earn extra points. Maybe one day I’ll hit level 99 and be the ""Survey King""! 👑😂

**Quick Bonus: Use My Link for an Extra +10% on Surveys 🎉**  
If you use my link, you’ll get a 10% bonus on surveys for your first 24 hours, which means you can boost your points right from the start! It’s a win-win for both of us. 🎉

**Leaderboard System: Serious Effort Needed 😅**  
There’s also a leaderboard, but I’ll be honest—it’s a bit intense. I haven’t made it up there yet because you need to fill out a ton of surveys to stay on top. Maybe one day I’ll reach ""survey warrior"" status!

**Create Virtual Credit Cards with Your Points 💳**  
One of the coolest features: you can actually create virtual credit cards with your points. I made one for Amazon, and it worked perfectly. It’s a fun way to treat yourself with what you’ve earned!

If you’re looking to make a little extra in your free time, Prime Opinion is worth a shot. I’ve been using it while commuting or waiting around, and those points start adding up. Like they say, “little drops make a mighty ocean”! Give it a try and let’s start earning!

When it opened, an older woman, likely in her late sixties, stood at the entrance.

She was of medium build, dressed in a floral gown that gave her an air of simple elegance. Her hair was neatly pinned back into a tidy bun, and large horn-rimmed glasses framed her inquisitive eyes.

""Yes?"" she asked, her tone polite yet measured, as she peered at me through the thick lenses.

""Good evening, ma'am,"" I greeted her, with a small nod. ""I'm Emily Moore. I happened to be passing through this town and noticed the 'For Rent' sign on your property.""

 ""I'm traveling and was hoping you might consider renting the space to me for a short stay.""

“Hello Emily, glad to meet you and please call me Martha,” she responded, breaking into a warm smile as I shook her hand.

“The guest house is certainly available for rent. How long are you planning to stay?”

“I’m looking to stay for a month, maybe longer,” I replied, quickly concocting a story about how I was conducting research on the local history and folklore of the town and its surrounding areas.

She nodded thoughtfully, listening with genuine interest, before outlining the terms and conditions.

After I paid a small advance, she disappeared inside to retrieve the keys and returned a few moments later, then led me to the guest house.

As we walked through the garden, I couldn’t help but admire the neat rows of vegetables that had been carefully planted, resembling a tiny market in its own right.

Martha next inserted the key into the door and opened it, gesturing for me to enter.

The guest house, though small, was cozy and well maintained, offering all the essentials— a cot, kitchenette, attached bath, TV, and refrigerator. She placed the key in a bowl and wished me goodnight as she quietly closed the door behind me.

I set the Chanel bag on a nearby chair and sat down on the bed, just to momentarily rest my sore back. But the exhaustion immediately hit me like a tidal wave, and all I could think of was sleep.

I removed the medallion from my pocket and set it on the bedside table, then lay down, drifting off into a deep, immediate slumber.

When I opened my eyes, I could sense that dawn had broken, but I remained motionless, unwilling to leave the warmth of the bed.

Yet, something had jolted me from my sleep, and then I heard it again.

A siren, distant at first, but growing louder and more urgent with every passing second.

Panic surged through me, and I sat up, eyes darting around the room. Everything appeared normal, untouched, but the siren’s wail only intensified.

I rushed to the front door and tried to open it. But it was wedged tight, as though something was holding it shut from the outside. Desperate, I pushed through hard, managing just enough space to peek through.

My heart stopped when I saw Martha lying on the ground, a pool of blood surrounding her.

I pushed the door with all my strength, and it finally gave way, causing Martha’s body to roll over the doorstep and into the garden. Stumbling out of the house, I watched in horror as her blood soaked into the soil.

The sirens pierced the air as I stood motionless, waiting for fate to take its course, watching the compound fill with police cars, as officers spilled out of the vehicles, guns drawn.

My eyes snapped open again as I lay in bed, realizing I had just been jolted awake from yet another unsettling dream.

 Before I could shake off the lingering shivers, I heard a knock on the front door.

I sat up straight, immediately pinching myself to ensure I wasn’t trapped in a dream within a dream.

When the sting shot through me, I jumped out of bed and hurried to the door, my mind already racing with worry about what would happen next.

To my surprise and relief, I found Martha standing at the doorstep, smiling with a breakfast tray in hand.

“Good morning, Emily,” she greeted me warmly. “Sorry if I spooked you,” she added, noticing the worried look on my face. “I saw your car parked in the same spot since yesterday, and I wondered if you’d had anything decent to eat. So I thought I’d bring you something.”

“Nothing fancy—just some stew made with our home grown produce and hot coffee for you,” she said, extending the tray.

I accepted it gratefully, but my gaze drifted to a young man working in the garden—a boy about 16 or 17. The basket he held in hand was filled with tomatoes, carrots, lettuce, cucumbers, zucchini, and bell peppers. Martha noticed my gaze and immediately explained.

“This is Alex, one of my neighbors. He’s a strong young man with a good head on his shoulders. He likes to help an old lady like me out,” she said with a fond smile. The young boy raised his hat at me before getting back to work.

“Thank you so much for this, Martha. I’m famished, I won’t lie,” I said finally to Martha as I held the tray.

She gave me a knowing smile and turned to head back to her house, but paused before looking back at me.

“Tell you what, why don’t you join me for lunch later today? I know you haven’t had time to set up yet. Please, come by my place any time after 1. And I am not taking no for an answer. Great, that’s settled then” She gave me a final smile before continuing her walk, leaving me stranded at the doorway before I even had the time to respond.

I closed the door and set the tray on the bed, my gaze immediately drawn to the medallion on the table. So much had happened in the last five minutes, and it was all making my head spin.

After what happened at the bank, I didn’t want anyone else getting hurt, especially not ending up dead—much less bringing the police into my life again.

Just the thought of it made my stomach twist, and I considered packing up and moving immediately. 

But something inside me kept me rooted.

Maybe I was where I was supposed to be.

After all, the raven led me here, to this town, and perhaps even to this house. Maybe, just maybe, I could pick up something on Ben.

Meanwhile the first spoonful of stew was heavenly. I couldn’t tell if it was Martha’s cooking or simply the fact that I hadn’t eaten properly in days, but it was pure bliss nevertheless. It just seemed to melt in my mouth and was easily the best thing I’d tasted in ages. I devoured the rest quickly, and washed it down with the hot coffee.

I next set about organizing the place with the few belongings I had.

I carefully pulled the cash out of my bag and spread it under the mattress, hiding it as best I could.

As I shoved the empty bag beneath the bed, the sound of something shifting caught my attention. Ducking down to investigate, I spotted an empty bowl that still carried the faint, sour scent of old milk.

But what truly made my skin crawl was the pile of snake skin beneath the cot, lying in a small heap, dried and crumpled, possibly remnants of a shedding.

My senses went on high alert as I began carefully combing the room for any signs of a serpent.

The small quarters didn’t take long to search, and I was nearly done when my eyes eventually landed on a wooden cupboard across the room, its door slightly ajar.

I approached it cautiously, opened it, and scanned the shelves. It was empty. But something else caught my attention—a floorboard beneath the cupboard was slightly loose.

I pried it open and stopped in my tracks.

Beneath it lay Ben’s cell phone, its screen cracked, and beside it, his Colt Python revolver—the gun he always carried. A chill ran down my spine as the weight of the discovery sank in.

The cellphone was dead and gone. So I picked up the pistol and checked the chamber; it still had five rounds left.

*So* *where is Ben now? Why did he leave his things here? Why did he come to this town, just like I did? And of all places, why this particular house? Is he still lingering somewhere in this town? Is the medallion, in its own mysterious way, trying to bring the two of us back together?*

But then a darker thought crossed my mind—*what if he’s no longer alive?*

The possibility made my chest tighten painfully.

On one hand, I felt a glimmer of relief, finally uncovering clues about his disappearance, which had haunted me for weeks.

On the other, a growing sense of dread began to take hold. Now that I was closer to the truth, I wasn’t sure if I truly wanted to uncover it.

One thing was certain though—the answers lay in the house at the other end of the garden. As I looked across the rows of neatly laid-out plants, a familiar sense of unease crept over me, and I began to fear for my safety once again. But I knew there was no turning back now.

I showered and got ready for my lunch with Martha. Tucking the pistol securely into the small of my back, I set off toward her house.

As I walked through the small garden, my mind drifted back to the incident at the pawn shop a few months ago, the memory surfacing as vividly as if it had just happened yesterday.

“Elise… Elise… ELISE!” Ben’s voice echoed through the store, startling me. I turned to see him standing frozen, his face a mix of horror and subtle amusement.

His eyes darted between my face and my hands, and when I followed his gaze, I froze.

I was holding both medallions—one ruby-encrusted, the other emerald-encrusted.

I didn’t even remember picking them up.

Mesmerized, I simply stood there, oblivious to the store assistant’s warnings, clutching the auric seals of Teotihuacan.

The emerald medallion, in particular, burned itself into my memory. It featured a serpent coiled around an hourglass—a detail that now struck me as disturbingly significant.

Then the memory blurred again.  One moment I was inside the store, and the next, I was sprinting outside with both medallions clutched tightly in my hands.

In no time, the cops were in hot pursuit, with Ben desperately trying to outrace them.

“I’ll draw them away,” he finally said, as he pulled over near an underground tunnel, urging me to escape on foot.

I hesitated, but as he kissed me goodbye, I shoved the emerald medallion into his hand, silently praying he’d make it. I watched as he sped off, the sirens growing louder in the distance.

 

Now, back in the present, I found myself standing before the purple door.

I rang the bell, and Alex appeared almost instantly, wearing an apron and welcoming me inside with a friendly smile.

“Martha’s still in the kitchen,” he said, leading me to the living room.

I nervously glanced around the room. The house was modest yet inviting, and decorated with care. A large TV took center stage on the wall, with a single armchair angled toward it—suggesting quiet evenings spent alone.

On one of the other walls hung framed photographs, some showing Martha with a man of similar age, their smiles frozen in happier times.

“That’s Henry, my husband,” Martha said softly from behind me, her voice steady. I turned to see her pointing at one of the photos. “He passed away five years ago,” she added.

Martha and I sat down, exchanging small talk about everyday things. When the moment felt right, I pulled out Ben's photo and casually asked if she'd seen him, keeping my tone light to avoid raising any suspicion.

Martha shook her head, a slight frown crossing her face. “No, dear. No one’s stayed at my guest house for quite some time. We don’t get many visitors around here,” she replied quickly without batting an eyelid.

 I, of course, knew she was lying.

 “Shall we have lunch?” she asked quickly, her tone almost too casual, as though trying to divert the conversation, before swiftly making her way toward the dining table.

 Alex had already set the table, arranging an inviting spread: roasted chicken, green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, and a freshly baked apple pie. The aroma filled the room, which would have ideally made my stomach growl in anticipation, but all it did now was deepen my suspicions.

The gun pressed against my back as I eased into my seat, and I silently prayed I wouldn’t be forced to use it.

Martha moved with practiced calm, pouring iced tea for everyone, while Alex meticulously served generous portions of chicken onto each plate

“What will I do when you leave, kiddo?” Martha said, looking at Alex with a fond, wistful expression. “Our boy here will be heading off to Harvard this summer on a full scholarship to study law,” she added, turning to me, her voice filled with pride.

As she down, Martha served more food, moving deftly across the platters.

I waited patiently for the two of them to start eating before I put a morsel of food in my mouth. The food was obviously delicious but my appetite by this point had already been killed.

Then, as Martha reached across the table for more potatoes, something glinted at her neck.

I froze. The emerald medallion swung from a gold chain around her throat - its distinctive serpent coiling around an hourglass—impossible to miss.

My stomach clenched as my mind began to race.

Martha, even as she noticed the color draining from my face, calmly spooned more mashed potatoes onto her plate, her expression serene and almost nonchalant.

Alex remained engrossed in his meal, while I shifted nervously in my seat.

The food in my mouth felt stuck  at the back of my throat as I struggled to swallow, causing me to suddenly erupt into a coughing fit.

 I grabbed for my iced tea in a panic, but as I tried to place it back on the table, it slipped from my grasp and crashed to the floor.

“Alex, why don’t you bring Emily another glass?” Martha intervened, gesturing toward the kitchen.

Before Alex could react, I stood up quickly, raising a hand to stop him. “I’ll get it,” I said, my voice abrupt.

I needed a moment away from them, away from the room.

In the kitchen, I gripped the counter, steadying myself as I reached for a glass. That’s when I heard it—clear and unmistakable.

“Elise… Elise… ELISE!”

The voice sent a jolt through me. It was Ben. It was Ben’s voice. My heart raced as I turned toward the hall.

The television, which had been off moments ago, was now turned on. A grainy video played on the screen, displaying security footage from the pawn shop.

My legs moved on their own, carrying me back into the living room where I collapsed into a chair, my knees almost giving away.

On the screen, the footage played like a nightmare brought to life.

There I was, standing in the shop, holding the medallions in both hands, my eyes locked in a daze, wild with desire as Ben started to speak louder and louder trying to get my attention.

The shop assistant, Pete, looked alarmed, gesturing for me with his hands to put the medallions down.

But I ignored them both, my grip tightening as I stared at the medallions, completely mesmerized.

It wasn’t until Ben placed a firm hand on my shoulder and gave me a hard shake that I finally broke free from the spell.

Reluctantly, I set the medallions back on the tray, my fingers hesitating as if they didn’t want to let go.

When I turned to look at Ben, his expression was a curious mix of amusement and quiet resolve.

But I knew him too well—behind that facade was the man I had fallen in love with, someone would do anything to give me what I wanted.

 I knew exactly what he was about to do as he turned to face Pete.

“Okay. I think I’d like to buy these. What’s it going to cost?” he asked, looking at Pete.

Pete, already visibly annoyed, scoffed. “Oh, come on, Ben. I’m not in the mood for this. Just last month, you came here to sell your ring because you were short on cash.”

“I mean it,” Ben pressed, his voice unwavering. “I want to buy them. I don’t care if they’re cursed. Tell me what it’s going to cost.”

Pete glared at him, exasperated, before finally spitting out, “Three hundred thousand dollars.” His tone dripped with disdain as he eyed the two of us, clearly expecting Ben to back down.

I nudged Ben urgently, whispering that it was time to leave, but the air between the two men crackled with tension. As Pete moved to return the tray to its place, Ben and I turned eventually to leave the store—then he stopped abruptly.

What happened next was something I could never fully understand or admit to myself even after all these months.

Ben’s face went cold, his expression vacant, like he’d fallen into a trance of his own. Without a word, he drew his revolver and fired.

The deafening shot echoed through the shop as Pete crumpled to the floor, lifeless. I gasped, my hands instinctively covering my mouth in shock.

Ben had always carried a firearm, but he wasn’t the kind of man to shoot first. He was not the trigger happy sort.

In fact he had never aimed that weapon at another person before, until that point. But now he stood motionless, his face unreadable.

“Pick up the medallions,” he said finally, his voice sharp and commanding.

Still in shock, I did as told, and together, we fled the shop, the medallions clutched tightly in my grasp.

The video suddenly came to a stop as the TV screen went blank.

Except for the sound of my own breathing, the room fell silent and the silence became suffocating as I felt two pairs of eyes looking straight at me, waiting patiently for me to react.

Summoning what little courage I had left, I forced myself to meet Martha's gaze. Her eyes were unwavering, cold and accusing, while her fingers absently fidgeted with the chain around her neck.

""My son, my only child is dead because of you,"" she said, her voice steady but quivering with restrained emotion. ""My own  flesh and blood. He was all I had left in this world, and you took him from me.""

""And all for what? For this?""

She lifted the medallion from her neck, its emerald surface faintly gleaming in the dim light.

Her face contorted with a mix of grief and contempt, while I sat frozen, paralyzed by guilt and unable to muster a response.

""You came all this way looking for your boyfriend, didn’t you? So take it. Find out for yourself.""

With a sudden flick, she sent the medallion sliding across the table, stopping just shy of my fingertips. Her words chilled me, but I slowly extended my hand, to pick up the medallion.

The moment my fingers closed around it, a sharp, searing pain shot through my head, blurring my vision. My head snapped back as a vivid, horrifying vision unfolded before me.

Ben appeared, his face breaking into a smile as he looked down where a serpent lay coiled on the floor with its hood up. He poured milk into a shallow bowl, and the snake drank from it.

The scene quickly shifted—Ben was now driving his car, the serpent wrapped around his arm. Each time the snake raised its hood, pointing left or right, Ben followed its silent command, turning the steering wheel accordingly.

The vision morphed again, this time to Martha's home. She sat on her couch, tears streaming down her face as she watched the security footage of her son’s murder on an endless loop.

The sound of a doorbell broke her from her misery, and she opened the door to find Ben standing there, smiling as he introduced himself.

I gasped as the vision ended, my body jerking back so suddenly that my head throbbed painfully. My temples pulsed as though they might split open.

Then, the scene shifted again—Ben was lying on the floor, clutching his throat, foaming at the mouth, while Martha silently stood over him, holding a half-consumed glass of iced tea.

At the same time, I felt something physically wrong with me as well. My body burned, like a violent fever was overtaking me.

Blood trickled from my nostrils, and the horrifying realization hit me—I had been poisoned, too.

My mind flashed to the iced tea served at the table. I was the only one who had touched it.

Dazed, I tried to rise from my seat, but my legs gave way, sending me crashing to the floor.

Alex rushed forward, steadying me with his hands as I struggled to stay conscious.

The moment his hands touched me, another vision surged through my mind with brutal force.

Alex stood in Martha’s living room, a meat cleaver glinting in his grasp. The blade arced through the air and came down with horrifying precision, striking Ben several times, who already lay lifeless on the floor.

The scene shifted again—Alex, burying Ben’s remains in shallow graves dug in the barren patch beside the house.

Days flickered by as Alex and Martha worked side by side, planting seeds in the freshly turned soil. Weeks blurred together, and the once-empty patch became a lush garden. The plants thrived, nourished by the horror that lay buried beneath.

The realization hit me like a truck: they had used those very vegetables from that garden to feed me.

My stomach churned violently as the nausea overwhelmed me. Staggering to my feet, I bolted for the door, desperate for air.

I stumbled into the garden, gulping in deep breaths, but the moment I took in my surroundings, the nausea returned with full force.

Doubling over, I retched, vomiting up the food I had just eaten, my body rejecting the horrifying truth.

When I turned back toward the house, Martha was standing there, watching me with a cold stare.

“Finish it,” she said, her voice steady and without remorse, as though this were a task no different from any other chore.

Behind her, Alex loomed, clutching a large knife in his hand.  In his other hand, he was holding Ben’s gun.

Instinctively, I reached for my back to check for my gun—but it was gone., I realized he must have deftly seized it when I had crashed to the floor.

Desperation surged through me as my hand found the ruby medallion in my pocket. Clutching both medallions in my hand ,I silently begged for a miracle even as my body teetered on the edge of collapse.

My temples burned as another vision took hold: this time I saw myself running into the guest quarters, flinging open the closet door, and grabbing another gun—just in time to stop Alex.

I threw both my medallions to the floor, staggered to my feet, and rushed toward the guesthouse, instinct pulling me toward the closet.

As I reached the closet , my hands  fumbled with the handle before finally throwing the door open.

Coiled inside the cupboard and hidden among the shadows, was a serpent. Its eyes glinted in the dim light before it lunged, sinking its fangs deep into my throat.

Pain erupted like fire, spreading rapidly through my veins. My body seized as the venom took hold, the strength draining from my limbs.

Darkness crept in at the edges of my vision, and I collapsed, the world fading as my consciousness slipped away.

When I woke, I had no sense of how much time had passed, but my body felt light, as if it had been restored to full health—as though I’d been reborn.

Ben's revolver lay beside me, cold and waiting. Next to it was the Chanel bag, brimming with cash. All the money I had hidden under the mattress had somehow been returned to the bag. I picked it up and stepped out cautiously, only to freeze at the sight before me.

Martha was lying face down in the grass, her throat slit, a crimson pool spreading beneath her. Nearby, Alex stood motionless, his expression distant, as though caught in a trance. In his hand, he gripped a bloodied knife.

As I emerged, his eyes flickered to me, and he dropped to one knee. “Your Highness,” he murmured, holding the knife aloft like an offering to royalty.

 My eyes however darted between the raven and the serpent lying still in the grass, their unblinking eyes locked on me, and the two medallions glinting on the ground between them.

Then, piercing through the suffocating silence, came the sound of sirens in the distance.

“What is happening?” I demanded, my voice trembling.

Alex’s gaze remained fixed on the ground. “It is the police,” he replied evenly. “I called them.”

“But why?” I asked, unable to hide my exasperation.

“You must make a choice, Your Highness,” he said, his voice calm yet unyielding.

“The medallions represent the future and the past. When you touched them for the first time, you became the natural custodian of the Auric Seals of Teotihuacan.”

His words sent a chill down my spine. “What does that mean?” I slowly asked.

“The medallions cannot be apart for long. They will always find a way get back together, no matter the cost—through whatever means necessary. ”

“But you hold the power now to decide how this story unfolds”

The sirens grew louder, closer, like a ticking clock urging me toward a decision.

“Pick up the medallions, Your Highness,” Alex said, his tone commanding yet reverent.

I hesitated before reaching down.

My fingers brushed the emerald-studded medallion, and a sharp pain shot through my forehead. A vision erupted in my mind—a harrowing glimpse of what was to come. I saw myself sitting on the grass, having abandoned the medallions and waiting for the police to arrive. Alex’s face, once composed, twisted into something unrecognizable. Without warning, he lunged at me, plunging the knife into my chest. The pain was visceral, and even within the vision, it left me gasping. I shuddered as the image dissolved.

My trembling hand moved to the ruby medallion. As I grasped it, another vision surged forward. This time, I saw myself running—driving away from the chaos as Alex charged toward the police, putting himself in harm's way in a desperate bid to buy me time. The visions faded, leaving me breathless and shaking.

“Have you made your choice, Your Highness?” Alex asked a moment later, his voice steady but his gaze firmly fixed on the ground.

I swallowed hard, nodding.

“Then give me the gun,” he said softly, extending his hand.

Reluctantly, I placed the revolver in his palm. Alex bowed once, solemn and final, before turning and sprinting toward the approaching sirens.

Shots rang out almost immediately as he fired at the sky before aiming his gun at the vehicles arriving in front of him.

I stumbled toward my car, the medallions and the bag of money clutched tightly in my hands. The serpent slithered onto the passenger seat, coiling itself with an eerie calm.

Overhead, the raven soared, charting a path forward as if guiding my escape.

I started the engine, the tires screeching as the car surged forward, speeding away just as a firefight ignited in the backdrop.

The road stretched ahead, an uncertain future waiting to unfold.

[Breakfast?](https://preview.redd.it/xexhta163y9e1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c3c5bc6975c20ac0aa63fe550651a2e6cfe1af4)

Awaking from the stupor of sleep, I can hear and feel my brain's synapses attempting to fire like old, sticky pistons in an overused engine struggling to turn over, emitting a faint, desperate mouse squeak. The stingy synapses are hesitant to expend energy for the sake of my lucidity as if conserving fuel for a long, uncertain journey, or a scene from a movie. They're firing with the intensity of a lit match in a soundproof walk-in safe where the air is as stale and the darkness is as dark as an unbathed rectum, where the owner inadvertently locked himself inside in darkness and low oxygen and is seeking comfort in not dying in silence and solitude. Today will be like a scene out of a movie!

For breakfast, I avoid the toxic substances masquerading as breakfast that are daily fed to children. Processed, sugar-loaded, artificially dyed cereals and 0% fruit juices that seem to be designed by capitalistic sadists or nutritionally nihilistic scientists. What kind of parents knowingly serve their kids a noxious cocktail to start the day? I want my child to eat addictive, sweet junk and be hyper for a good start to a morning . I want my child to mainline sugar, food dyes and artificial flavors, because what's a childhood without a few ADHD symptoms?

Odd how they've fallen under the spell of convenience and advertising, like flies to a poop mound of false promises and manipulated desires. An equation where capitalism and profit equal deception and disregard for health. A twisted arithmetic where the pursuit of profit is directly proportional to the erosion of our well-being, which in turn fuels the lucrative cycle of chronic illness, conveniently serviced by Big Pharma's endless supply of symptom-management solutions – never cures for customers, always patients for profits.

Pity for the teachers who have to deal with the aftermath of this insidious breakfast culture? Choreographing the education dance for sugar-fueled hyper children in the mornings and glucose peaks and lows leading to fatigue in the afternoon. Educators expected to function as nurses. Tasked with mitigating the damage inflicted by a society that prioritizes shareholders over children's health. Do they manage discipline like a game of whack-a-mole, striking with swiftness and discretion? Or slip a calming tonic to calm the children? It's a heroic task, really, and a testament to the dedication and patience of our underpaid, under-appreciated educators.

I had a snot attack last night, but I knew better than to sip on the celebrated poison called NyQuil. A supposedly soothing elixir is actually a toxic potion of high-fructose corn syrup, sucrose, and artificial sweeteners, mixed with a medley of synthetic dyes, including the infamous Yellow No. 6, which has been linked to hyperactivity and cancer. And a death beckoning dose of acetaminophen, which can wreak havoc on your liver and kidneys. The ingredient label reads like a how-to guide for slow-release rat poisoning, cloaked as relief. And yet, parents are encouraged to feed this noxious brew to their sniffling kids, guaranteeing a lifetime of dependence on pharmaceuticals and a weakened immune system to boot. Like a scene out of a movie!

[Local News](https://preview.redd.it/dip3g2xl3y9e1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2deb40d723f355476099a15a1dde802e49177d2)

I reluctantly turn on the local news on my Un-Smart TV. The fake news on the screen casts an eerie glow on my walls and the news anchor twitches with sensationalism-induced body tremors. His limbs jerking in a spasmodic dance, his eyes rolling back, tongue withdrawing  to the back of his throat like a vending machine pulling in a dollar bill. The anchor's voice booms in, adopting that signature tone of feigned gravitas and manufactured urgency, like a used car salesman, the one that says, 'This is serious, folks, but not so serious that we can't cut to a commercial break about the new lavender Nyquil in 30 seconds.' His voice a cacophonous caricature of credibility. Morphing into actor, his voice a jarring mashup of feigned empathy and calculated hysteria. We have shocking reports coming in of yet another woman being punched in the face for walking with a plain, style-less swagger, a gait that's an affront to urban fashion, an insult to native New Yorkers who seem to demand a certain je ne sais quoi from their fellow pedestrians...or else.

Our reporter, Nancy Newsie, is live on the scene of this barbaric fashion scolding. Nancy, can you tell us more about what happened? Nancy replies, ""Yes, I'm here with the victim, who's still shaken by the ordeal. It was like a scene out of a movie! Young lady, can you describe what happened?"" The victim trembles, like a furless polar bear, her words barely above a whisper, like a conversation between ants. Victim responds, her face reddened with the imprint of a fist on her cheek, a livid, swollen bruise that's already starting to darken, like a browning banana, ""It was like a scene out of a movie! He ran up to me and punched me, and it hurt so bad... like...like a scene out of a movie!"" The camera lingers on her face, the bruise a stark reminder of the violence she endured, which will undoubtedly provide a boost for TV ratings. As the camera zooms in on the bruise, the victim's eyes well up with tears, her pupils constricting in a mixture of pain, surprise, and a flicker of guilty joy for being on TV. Nancy Newsie asks, ""And did you see your attacker? Can you describe them to us?""

""He punched me and hopped away on one leg,"" yelling, ""'Yo, walk right, hoe! Ain't no strollin' in the hood!' It was totally like a scene out of a movie!""

After my painstaking consumption of local news, I drink my cheap instant coffee with a shot of apple cider vinegar, one bitter flavor masking the other, I switch to Al-Jazeera and BBC news for factual news, where journalistic integrity is not ritually sacrificed at the altar of ratings and advertising revenue. I savor my rancid coffee, far from the high-quality Indonesian coffee made from a coffee bean defecated by the Asian Palm civet. I prefer my coffee beans not to pass thru the rectum of living creatures. My synapses awaken from their sleep, firing with a sense of relief, from exposure to news organizations whose professionalism  counteract the superfluous sensationalism of local news. Grounded in reality, these news outlets prioritize veracity over shock value. The defibrillator-like jolt from actual news provide equilibrium and I can get back to critical thinking and prepare to use my day off for grocery shopping, which is essentially an unpaid workday in a different location. Few tasks require more critical thinking than grocery shopping. Like a scene out of a movie.

I trudge out to restock my fridge and pantry, begrudgingly surrendering to the death grip of my local supermarket. As I approach the supermarket, I'm met with a monotonous façade that seems to absorb the color from the surrounding landscape of neighboring businesses. Their bright color schemes become faint in a rat-like gray.  The gray brick exterior appears dull and haunted. The gray signs bearing the store's name seem to whisper half-truths and dares. The gray doors slide open with a creepy whoosh, revealing a world of numbing conformity driven by capitalism. The overall effect is hypnotic, as if the ""dupermarket's"" very architecture is designed to lull me into a state of trance shopping, where critical thinking is abandoned in favor of mindless consumption. Like a scene out of a movie. It's essentially a drab concrete box with large windows covered with generic posters stating the obvious or outright lies: Fresh bread. Fresh dairy. Fresh produce. Low Prices. But posters should read: Stale bread but not yet moldy. Nearly expired milk (and we keep the newer milk in the back of the fridge in a corner difficult to access to discourage you from reaching it). Produce is semi-fresh but store-prepared produce is definitely old. Lowest Prices but only Highest Prices guarantee freshness.

I hate this anti-gut-health food prison, but its proximity and convenience have me firmly in its grasp. The narrow aisles seem designed to trap me, with crowded merchandise stacked on either side, making me feel like a hyperventilating roach caught on a roach motel. The air is thick with the smell of stale bread and old fish. My eyes recede deep into my skull attempting to evade the overpowering odors. The light is so bright, it's difficult to see, as if to discourage label reading. The shoppers, faces gaunt and hopeless, shuffle along single file through each aisle as if they're on a conveyor belt leading them to a meat grinder. Their empty stares suggest a complete surrender to the supermarket's machinations. As they reach the checkout line, they cast wistful glances towards the front windows, sensing liberation on the other side of the posters covering them. Like a scene out of a movie.

As I grabbed my collar and dragged myself away from the supermarket, I'm reminded that life is not, in fact, a Hollywood movie – no matter how many times we describe it that way. 'It was like a scene out of a movie' has become a ubiquitous cliché, often used as a lazy shorthand to describe anything that's even remotely surprising or unusual. Everything today is 'like a scene out of a movie.' Perhaps it's time we stop letting scripts dictate our lives and start living them. But what does that phrase even mean? Are we so detached from reality that we need to make every moment sound like a Hollywood special effects sequence? Or are we just too lazy to come up with something more original? Have we become so accustomed to parroting the familiar tropes, clichés, and idioms that permeate our shared cultural lexicon? Is this the reason for  a proliferation of phrases and expressions that are endlessly repeated in everyday conversation, social media, and media outlets? We have lost our capacity for genuine observation and description.

Perhaps it's time for us to start living our own reality – and experience life like a moment from real life, with our own thoughtful narrative.",1,1735547709.0,postdefecation,0,1.0,False

There’s a ton of context but I’m going to try to keep it to the most relevant information for brevity sake. So I have a friend group of 3 girls (including me) and 3 guys and the 6 of us have all been friends and family friends since like middle school (different ages tho and one of the guys and one of the girls are siblings so it’s a very blended dynamic).

One of the guys and I briefly dated over the summer and things quickly ended and it’s been sooo weird since. Because of him and his actions, although I’m open to the idea that I could be being dramatic and sensitive? I go back and forth. This all took place over 1 month in the summer. This will be pretty rambly but it’s like and my thoughts feel scattered but it goes like this:



Backstory:

Him and I have both been attracted to eachother since we met and throughout highschool but it was very “undercover” so-to-speak because we were just attracted to eachother but not trying to date or anything. Chill overall nothing crazy. Fast forward, he goes away to college and is dating this girl who was pretty toxic (according to him but he’s not a super reliable source tbh) and he basically went radio silent for like a year and a half from his family and all of us in the friend group. Eventually, they break up and despite him being an ass to everyone for all that time, of course we all welcome him back and are excited to spend the summer all of us together again. 

The first night back, he tells all of the rest of our friends except for me that he’s “had a crush on me for 8 years” and “if she would have texted me I would have come home” and he’s telling the boys that “she’s it” “she’s perfect” and his brother said “he’s like in love with her” so on and so forth. He spends the whole summer saying this kind of stuff and even get’s all our friends in on “wingmanning” for him and his whole family knows. It was suppose to be on the down low so that he could “plant seeds” as he put it to try to spend the summer getting in my good graces and basically trying to inspire feelings in me for him. What he doesn’t know (to this day) is that One of the friends (one of the girls who her and I are the closest) would tell me every single thing he would say and every single thing that was happening. So no one knows that I knew the whole time. So as weird as it may sound, it did kinda charm me. I’ve never dated anyone before this (like never even held a guys hand) and all our friends are like telling him that he better not mess this up because he’s known to be somewhat of a player and bullshitter. While, yes, I did know this about him, there were several factors that made me think this was different. 1.) telling his family (and friends) about it 2.) being friends with me and knowing that I don’t date guys and that I’m very apprehensive 3.) that he was on his “apology tour” and made it seem like he really understood that he was an ass and 4.) the fact that all summer he was so sweet and everyone felt it. In fact, it felt like he was just the most fun and the sweetest any of us have ever seen him and it was truly the best summer we’ve ever had. It was just so fun having everyone back and it just felt different. So eventually he starts texting me listening to my favorite musician (a 6hr playlist that he listened to all the way through mind you) and watching my favorite movies and we’re talking everyday. Eventually he asks me my favorite flower which is a flower that my grandma grows and isn’t one that you can just buy at the store. He could find anywhere that sold it, so you know what he did? Bought the SEEDS to grow the flowers himself. This was before he even asked me out. Then he finally asked me to dinner.



Dating:

So we go on 2 dates total. Both so incredible and so fun, which he even said himself to his family. In fact, he told his dad that he hasn’t been this happy in a long time. On our first date, he picks me up and I’m very nervous (first date ever!) and he can tell so he pulls out flowers and tells me that he wants to make it really special for me. We go to dinner and he tells me himself everything he told everyone else all summer. I tell him that I’m not sure I’m ready to date anyone and he says, “I’ll wait another 8 years.” We walk around downtown and stop into this candy store and he’s telling the guy behind the counter that it’s out first date and “he’s finally worked up the courage to ask me out” and so the guy gives us chocolate covered strawberries on the house. Our second date we went out of town to this cute little city and I showed him around and this old man came up to us and said he had to tell us we were a beautiful couple and we’re so smiley. I’m just trying to paint a picture. It felt like a movie and was very cute. Eventually we kissed (first kiss ever!) and things kinda ramp up to pretty “passionate” makeout sessions. Which is the extent it went, no sex or anything. He told my friend that I was a super good kisser (the best kisser he’s ever been with in fact) and I stayed the night twice because I’m comfortable enough to do that (we’ve all always had sleepovers) but like I said on our first date, I wanted to take things slow. Mind you, this was still only week 2 of seeing each other. He would always, and by always I mean multiple times everytime we hung out, say “I’m so lucky” “I can’t believe this is real” “I can’t believe you want to date me” and etc. etc., that's just off the top of my head. He would also always talk about this 10 year plan he had and how he builds us a house and we have a big porch and a treehouse and dogs and how he’s gonna make coffee for us and we’ll sit out there. Just really trying to sell the dream here. And of course it was a fun vision but I always was worried that he was bullshitting me.

I have to say, I felt pretty awkward in front of his family and our friends at times because I *hated* how it felt like everyone was staring at us and always commenting on how we were and I understand it’s a funny or bizarre or weird thing to happen, but you can imagine how that can feel weird to be under a microscope. His family would also always say things like “I can’t believe she wants to date you” and “she’s too smart for you” and “don’t make her uncomfortable” and idk they rubbed me the wrong way. He would also say stuff like this all the time about himself or alluding to himself like, ruining things. 

The last week we were together, the 3 boys met us girls at the bar after we saw a comedian we’ve all followed for a few years. We’re kissing and hanging out and it’s the first time we’ve been in public doing that kinda couple-y thing and the first time a told our other friends (not in the main friend group) about everything as I was pretty apprehensive to say too much bc I wasn’t sure how much I was buying what he was saying and I told my friend (the same one who was telling me the info all summer) that I felt unsure. So I felt like a fool when the next day he ghosts me. In fact he ghosts me for 4 days. I tell him that somethings obviously not right and I’d prefer to talk it over. He says “Yeah I do want to talk to you” and it’s a hassle trying to meet up. In fact, he canceled on me the day of and we have to reschedule. All me organizing it btw, which I was annoying about since he’s obviously the one with a lot on his mind but alright. We meet at one of our friends houses that he’s helping them move out of. So they’re all there which was weird to me because it’s like he was using them as a cover or shield or something. Idk. Like less intimate with everyone there and that felt intentional. He says to me that he can’t give me the energy I deserve because he really has to focus on basketball. But he wants a relationship with me and that he, and I kid you not, wants to “grow old with me.” Now, I know this is all bullshit and I say, very kindly I might add like I’m not mad or throwing a fit I’m trying to be understanding, that I feel like he just doesn't’ like me and is scared to say that. I knew that we weren’t gonna be growing old together. So I even say that if he meets someone at school and wants to bring her around eventually that I don’t want him to feel weird about that because I want him to be happy and I would be happy for him and that he wouldn’t have to worry about me or anything. Which is true but I can’t say that I wasn’t bummed out because we had only been seeing eachother for like a month and because it was my first time for everything, it was all just so exciting to me and it was with someone I always thought was cute and I knew well so it was just very convenient. Anyway, he says, “oh no i won’t be talking to anyone. I mean i’m not even talking to anyone right now” and just the way he said it, I just knew that he was. This was later confirmed by one of the boys that he had actually met her and started talking to her when we were together. Surprise surprise. 

  


The aftermath:

So herein lies the issue. He told my friend (the same one) that I was (get this): “too much of a freak” and he “didn’t expect me to be like that”........what. He also said I have “too much energy” and that I was “too much like her (my friend)” He said “yeah idk why I told her i wasn’t gonna talk to other girls I knew it wasn’t true when I said it” and he also said that I was too “smart for him” and that he “wants a girl he can lie to and they’ll just believe him” I kid you not. He said those words verbatim. This is a more extreme version of who he was before this summer. The summer he was not this guy. So i keep hearing things he’s saying about me and so Halloween night we’re all together drinking and I asked him to clear the air (again- me having to ask him to talk even tho he’s the one with the problem) and mind you, I’m still trying to play it cool bc 1.) i don’t want to give him the satisfaction and 2.) I want to keep the peace for the dynamic of everyone. I still told him that it was really weird and hurtful but the convo was still light and we were laughing at times and I felt like we left off on a good enough note that i felt good atleast. I’m even laughing as I’m leaving. Days later, I find out he told his family that I was mad and slammed the door as I left. What?!?! 

I’ve not seen him since and New Years Eve will be the first night I see him and his new girlfriend (the one from when he ghosted me!!!). He says he’s in love with her and that “she’s it” so yeah it’s all pretty familiar. I feel like it’s gonna be all eyes one me again because it’s an awkward situation but I could just be paranoid.

I guess I don’t know what to do. It feels like I should be “doing” something as weird as that sounds but everything just feels weird.

1hpit5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1hpit5u/about_my_biological_mother/,About my biological mother,"This is the second post I made on here. The first one was a long story about my aunt and uncle who I refer to as my mom and dad/parents in the story(as well as in this one) and my life with them. I talked a bit about my birth mother, who I refer to as Tammy, in that story. And in this post I'm going to be talking more about her. 

One day my mom received a call from a relative in El Salvador saying that her niece Tammy, was headed to the United States and needed a place to stay. My mom agreed to letting her live in her home. So when Tammy got here my mom hooked her up with a job at a restaurant where my mom knew the owner. She worked there for about a week, when the owner called my mom to let her know he will be firing Tammy because she didn't want to work. He would give her tasks ""it's not busy right now go wipe the tables"" ""take out the trash"" ""wash the dishes"" and she would respond with ""I'm not doing that you do it"". 

Her non existent worth ethic and bad attitude got her fired. So she spent her time smoking drinking and hooking up with men while living with my parents. One day she confessed to my mom that she had gotten pregnant but had an abortion. My mom, being against abortions, told her why did you do that? you should have gave me the baby instead if you didn't want it. My mom had been wanting kids of her own but she wasn't able to conceive. 

So a short time after that Tammy got pregnant again but this time she told my mom about the pregnancy and said ""I want you to keep the baby"". My mom and dad agreed to it. Once I was born I was taken care of by who I refer to as mom and dad. I grew up thinking they were my biological parents. And only knew Tammy as my aunt as my parents had introduced her to me. I only saw Tammy on a few occasions. When I got to the 8th grade she offered to give me rides to school in the mornings. On the first day on the way to school we had a normal conversation but as soon as we got to the drop off line and I was about to get off of the car she stops me and says ""do you want to know who your real mother is? I am"". That's how I found out.

The next morning she comes to pick me up and again the conversation on the way there was normal until we got to the drop of line when she says, ""so do you want to know who your real dad is"" I said no. I never have wanted to know who he was because 1. Her choice in men is so bad I wouldn't want to meet him it might create more problems than solve them and 2. She's a known liar she probably doesn't even know who he is herself or she would lie about who he is. She looked shocked when I said no as if she was expecting me to say yes. 

After a few more days of her trying to have serious conversations like that and unfolding all this sensitive information to 13 year old me that I wasn't ready to handle, I told my mom I no longer wanted rides from her and it stopped. But then she started to do things that I still can't explain why but one day it was summer break and there is a library a few streets down from my house. I used to hang out there a lot with my friends or meet up with them there. I was 14. 

It was around 10 in the morning me and my friend were sitting on a bench outside of the library when a car pulls up next to us. I look over and it's Tammy with her window rolled down saying ""do you want to go get a coffee with me"" I said no I'm hanging out with my friend right now. I didn't want to go with her because I saw her as this unstable woman who I didn't trust and didn't want to be around. She took it horribly when I denied her request to go get coffee. So horribly that she took out her phone and started speaking into it ""yes there's this girl in front of the library she's selling drugs and smoking drugs. This is what she's wearing, her hair color and she is this tall"". She was talking to the police. I honestly thought she was bluffing I couldn't fathom what she was doing. 

My friend sitting there across from me watching all that she's like who is that? It was too much to explain so we got up and left Tammy talking to herself like a crazy person and walked to my friend's house where I stayed for the next two hours. At the time no one was at my house. My mom was at the store my dad was at work and I was at my friend's house. When my mom got home a neighbor went and asked my mom why there were police knocking at the gate. My mom mentioned she didn't know about it she had been at the store and was so confused as to why there had been police knocking at the door. 

When I eventually got home I told my mom what happened with Tammy and she told me about the police . Tammy had sent the police to my home after accusing me of selling and doing drugs at the library. It still angers me to this day because she really had nothing better to do than begin harassing the daughter she chose to give up 14 years ago. I used to go out a lot with my parents permission and sometimes without their permission, I just didn't enjoy being home for many reasons that I explain in my first post. So one day I planned to meet up with my friends at the library as I'm walking there and crossing the street a car stops at the stop sign and stays there it doesn't keep driving which was weird to me I look back and thru the windshield I see that it's Tammy and her then boyfriend, named Nelson. 

I had met Nelson when I was 12 when Tammy invited me to go watch a movie with her and Nelson. We watched the movie Annabelle I don't remember which one but I do remember that I found it weird Nelson never once looked me in the face never spoke to me and he kept looking down and had this smirk on his face the whole time. I just thought he was a weird dude. And I know ""were not supposed to judge a book by its cover"" but when ur gut has a weird feeling it's smart to listen to it and the feeling I was getting from Nelson was the same feeling I had about a guy who had molested me when I was 10. And this was the guy my mom was following me around with while I was trying to meet up with my friends. They drove up and down the street and did that for a couple of days back to back. I don't know what they were doing. 

Some could say well she's your biological mother even though she gave u up she still wants to look after u and make sure ur okay that would make sense if this wasn't the same lady who when my mom called her saying I'm sick (and I was sick often in my childhood) and the doctors won't see me without my biological mothers consent. Tammy would say things like yeah I'm on my way but never showed up. That happened on many occasions. I think the process for a child to be seen by a doctor is they need the birth parents permission unless it's the emergency room but I could be wrong. That's just what I remember happening. 

So one time I was 15 years old it was night time and I was out in the yard sitting on a chair when a car parks in front of the house the windows were tinted and I could only see that the person inside the car had long curly hair in a ponytail so I thought it was a woman. They eventually came out of the car and walked towards the gate where I was and I recognized him as being Nelson. He said ""hi I'm Tammy's ex boyfriend can I talk to you"" and I just want to say I have always been a very cautious, non trusting person I don't take chances and am always very alert. I also used to watch tons of crime documentaries and know most offenders are family members.

 Him coming to my house and trying to talk to 15 year old me had alarm bells ringing all over the place. At the time I had a pitbull who was barking at him thru the gate. Without thinking I just said ""get tf out of here or I'll let my dog loose on u"" and he just laughed and got in his car. I told my parents what happened and my mom calls Tammy demanding an explanation as to why her boyfriend came to my house at night trying to talk to me. Tammy wasted no time and started calling me a liar and said that never happened her boyfriend would never do that. Then a month later my cousin who I'll call Jose in this story, told my dad that Nelson admitted to him that he did go see me. The reason why I don't know. But the thought of my mom's boyfriend or ex boyfriend whatever he is to her coming to my house at around 10pm and trying to get me to talk to him I don't like even thinking about what could have happened if I decided to go outside and talk with him. 

I have made it clear to Tammy I don't want a relationship with her I was mature about it and tried to express to her I don't want problems no hate or grudges I just simply don't want to talk to u and even then she still comes to my house every now and then especially on holidays trying to talk to me. Earlier in this story I mentioned being molested by a guy when I was 10 years old. This guy named Pedro had been renting a room in our house and kissed me trying to shove his tongue into my mouth while my parents were outside having a party. So the days Tammy was giving me a ride to school in 8th grade she had this moment where she was like has anyone ever done anything to u like raped me or something. I said no but there was this guy who lived with us for a while who kissed me and she goes that's it?🙄 He just kissed u well that's ur fault for letting it happen and not calling the police now he's out there doing the same thing to other kids. Which really showcases how much of a sorry ""mother"" she was. 

Anyways that's my story about my biological mother I know it's long but I like to go into detail. so I hope y'all like to read 🙂",1,1735547446.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False

Or he could just be horrible. How to decide what I want from him?,"I (43F) have struggled with my family issues all my life and opted to not attend a Christmas gathering with all family members there. Today my father (75M) sent a pic from last year's gathering with me in it!  
My husband and I wonder if he misses me. I'm struggling with guilt and wanting to just have my own boundaries.

Let me try to make it easy to understand...

* Cultural background: I'm of Chinese descent, and am from a Southeast Asian country. In my discussions with peers of similar ethnicity, I've discoverd that 90% of us have severe mental, emotional and sometimes physical abuse or neglect. e.g. parents screaming and ranting non-stop. Parents do not really have conversations. Even where one parent is normal, the other seems to be way off. In my case, both parents are not quite there. It's also quite common for parents to talk at people. They were brought up to be reticent and stoic.
* Ancestry: I've heard that my grandfather was really abusive towards his wife and my father, including physically.
* Socioeconomic background: Low. My father has been working in service jobs, and people in my country can be very harsh and rude to service staff.
* My father with my mom: He was verbally and emotionally abusive towards my mom, up to her passing. When I was young, my mom was abusive towards me but after her passing and with my readings, I started to see her as an abuse victim who took it out on me. I think they might have had good days, but with my readings about abuse, I wonder if it was just part of the cycle where he lashed out at her, then apologises and be nice, then repeat.
* My father with his family: I think they had rows in the past and became distant. Since I became a teenager and started being more aware, they hardly speak. It was my mom or sis being a conversation starter. My father would stay silent.
* My father with his acquaintances: I don't know much about what they say. Nowadays he sees them every morning and evening for coffee at a local coffeeshop nearby. When I observe him, he seems to be scrolling on his phone. He also seems to talk at people, rather than with people.
* My father with me now: He is mostly on his phone, and doing stuff  like checking the weather, checking currency rates. He really has nothing to check. He would stare into silence. Or when he does speak, it can be very hurtful. e.g. Me: ""How was that concert? Did you sing?"" Him: ""What a \[dumb\] question. What's the point of asking?""
* Health: He retired about 5 years ago. Only this year did he say why: ""I started blanking out while driving. I would forget where I am."" I couldn't get any more out of him. I've asked my counsellor about some situations and he agreed that there could be signs of dementia but they could also be forgetfulness.

My confusion is with what I see:

* He could have autism, ADHD, or dementia. Or all of them. Or none.
* He is a grown man who needs to own his actions. 
* He is very much stuck in his upbringing. His literacy level/preferences means he's not consuming information about being a better parent, how to have a conversation. He's just reading random news. Such information is also lacking in the Simplified Chinese news.
* I want peace.
* I don't want to regret missing out on this time when he's healthy and we can talk and travel.

Also I'm pregnant and moody. So! I successfully paid off all my cc debt (20k) last year with my husband by the Dave Ramsey baby steps model of not spending... I was addicted to retail therapy so I get how hard the habit is to break. I'm still mad at my friends for complaining when they do it. 

I have two friends the same age as me (30) who make more than me and pay less rent/utilities than I pay etc (cause we talk about our expenses), and they keep complaining about not being able to pay off their debt. I am recently helping one out by renting a spare room in my house for $500 and no utility fee in San Francisco, CA area. 

These last two weeks I been hanging out with my friends more and they both keep spending and spending and spending - and I always decline the spend opportunity. Like today! We went on a hike today an hour away and they stopped 3 times for fancy coffee and snacks at boutique places. I skipped out. I suggested they bring jackets for the weather, they said no, then bought one for $60 at the nearest gift shop. This happens often, they 'don't have' a clothing piece to be comfortable so they buy the next one they see. 

Then they wanted to stop at a vintage clothing store and spent $200 each (a $200 jacket, and two dresses). Then they wanted crab for dinner and spent $300 on crab. Not a special occasion. I bought and ate a $13 noodle plate and skipped the big ass bill. At dinner they started planning a trip out of state and one of them booked tickets. Not me! 

They asked me for my opinion before they made purchases and I tell them straight up they spend too much (""I wouldn't do that if I were trying to pay down debt"") and they'll say things like ""I got a $500 bonus it's fine"" and I'll say ""that could be $500 less debt you have"" and they shrug. It's not just today.. . Now that I live with one of them, she is constantly eating at restaurants, or buying groceries and letting them spoil every week! Both of them always ask me to join them and if I decline, they offer to pay for me. I'm tired of it, and still decline. 

Again, I make the least of my 2 friends (one is a director of a nonprofit, the other a tenured teacher in highest paying district) and they bring up how I'm making the least. But how I understand it at the end of the day, it's not how much you make - it's how much you keep! 

I'm just tired of having to see them blow up their finances and me having to be 'the logical friend' as they say it. I care about them and tell them it sucks to see them like this, but they acknowledge they have a problem and resolve to do better in the future but don't. I also hate being on a budget and meeting my goals, and not bringing my friends along to succeed with me. I feel like a bad guy, tho I'm doing the right thing. It sucks to keep turning them down, but also they shouldn't be going out either! 

I also feel like it's setting us up in the long run to where my friends will need my help financially and I'll have to turn them down because it's literally 'I told you so', and also no one making $120,000 should be asking someone making $60,000 for money. And I would not give it to them. 

Also, I'm pissed off that I'm letting one of them live for cheap at my place and she blows it on bullshit. She's moving out soon and I'm glad, so it doesn't keep making me pissed off. 

End of rant= at the end of the day you can't control people, but you can work on not enabling them. I'll continue to be critical and keep my boundaries. XP",0,1735547267.0,rant,1,0.5,False

1hpiqpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1hpiqpt/psa_i_realised_today_how_openai_calculate/,"PSA: I realised today how OpenAI calculate Advanced Voice minutes per day, and it's not pretty.","So here I was, using ChatGPT Advanced Voice today like usual—asking it questions, getting responses—generally having a grand ol' time when I had the hankering for some lunch. 

Now normally I'd close my browser, but today I decided to just mute my mic and get back to it once I'd finished eating. 

See, I was of the impression that the time limit for Advanced Voice per day a pro account was assigned calculated based on the **number of minutes responding**—*ie. you had a limited amount of minutes of voice tokens the system would generate per day.*

Discussing this when OpenAI launched Advanced Voice earlier this year with other users seemed to correlate with their experiences of the feature too.

The kicker? **That's not how it actually works.**

For me it was a quick lunch. Grabbed a coffee, ate some food while watching a YouTube video, nothing fancy, but the second I finish the last bite of my meal and about to get back to work when, unprompted GPT speaks up and tells me:

""I'm sorry, you've reached your limit for Advanced Voice today, you can switch to standard voice to continue the conversation.

**To be honest, I was a bit dumbfounded.** 

So here I was, unwittingly burning through the remaining minutes of my Advanced Voice while I crammed a damn Caesar salad and a cup of joe into my face, and watched random crap on YouTube.

This may not be new information to some, but it was completely unexpected for me... and to be honest a little bit bullshit on the part of OpenAI. I really wish they'd be more transparent about how limits are calculated *(yes yes I know there are token calculators that can approximate this for normal chat)*, and provide better indicators of time remaining.  
  
**I mean come on OpenAI—it's almost 2025—any first year CS student knows how to code a goddamn simple countdown clock.**

1hpiot3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1hpiot3/baffled_gastritis_just_from_dairy/,Baffled: gastritis just from dairy?,"Tl;dr could dairy be the sole cause of gastritis with slow motility and constipation but no other lactose intolerant symptoms? If not what’s going on?

Long version: was having stomach dis-ease / nausea, with mostly constipation, no bloating gas or cramps. Stomach not gut, and lost 10-15lbs over a 6-12 months.  The gastric symptoms came on subtlyfor a long time, but in hindsight they resulted in me naturally eating less cos I’d feel full or mildly uncomfortable => slow calorie reduction.  I noticed slow motility and a tendency to constipation. Stomach was where the mild symptoms were.  Finally they got worse to point of disrupting my day and making it hard to concentrate on anything.  Guts really slowed down + constipation, and morning esp i was getting nausea finally to the point of vomiting.

At that point i did a severe elimination diet: white rice and cabbage with really mild herbal tea.  Also went to primary.  Elimination diet made a small difference from the start so i knew i was onto something.

Dr evaluated from physical exam it was definitely stomach, not guts, spleen,colon, appendix… she felt literally all organs and the only sensitivity was stomach.

She diagnosed irritation of stomach lining, told me to continue with my bland elimination diet plus Pepsid for at least 2 weeks for it to heal.

It really did and i started adding things back. long story a bit shorter… the morning half and half in coffee!  I reintroduced black coffee as well as everything but the dairy... excelpt small amounts of butter (to sauté mushrooms and on toast, so pretty small amounts).  Now a few months later I’ve started to add some dairy here and there… but now I’m scared of it.

But everything i read says dairy intolerance is in the guts not the stomach, and things better! Remembered what it was like to eat a whole plate of food again!  Weight creeping back unfortunately but much better.

I’m still off dairy but been creeping some back in, i ended up w some whipped cream and felt i had to use it 🤪 in coffee and on morning danish… didn’t seem to agree… 

But everything suggests that dairy allergy should affect gut not stomach, and gastritis shouldn’t be dairy only.  I’m having no probs w other fatty foods (chicken, eggs fried in olive oil, even French fries occasionally) …and coffee should be a trigger, but I’m fine with my one black coffee in the AM.

Can anyone help me understand what is going on?",1,1735546935.0,Gastritis,3,1.0,False
1hpiort,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hpiort/how_quitting_coffee_revealed_my_adhd/,How quitting coffee revealed my ADHD,"Hey guys,

i just want to share a short story with you.

I was a heavy coffee drinker, to a point where my shaking hands & spilling coffee was normal.  
Quit coffee, had cramps and crazy headache.. it was hell.

Stopped for a few months but got back to it after a while because i missed the ritual. (Decaf only)  
Had a easy job and a side hustle that i enjoyed.. but my drive got lost. Started fitness to lose weight & started to take caffeine (normal coffee) again, to get more done in the gym.

As you can imagine, i got addicted again. Not as much as before, but around two cups daily.

After a while i stopped the gym, got a girlfriend, a new job & new responsibilities.  
Stopped caffeine again & we saw that some of my problems worsen dramatically over the period of a few months.

Normally i forget a lot of things, my thoughts jump a lot and i talk about a lot of subjects in a short amount of time (just examples) but.. in this period of time it wasn't bearable anymore.

I was searching for things all the time (even if i had them seconds ago), couldn't concentrate on my job (forgot steps all the time, made a lot of mistakes, was very agitated), made a lot of mistakes in my daily life, was depressed more frequently, slept a lot more... and there are many more thing i could say but i think you guys got the point.

These things are normal for me, at least i thought they where normal. After taking caffeine again (2 spoons in the morning in my decaf lupine coffee), i can see that i still have these symptoms..but not nearly as bad. I made a lot of tests, spoke to family and my girlfriend, to doctors... and its quiet clear that i have some sort of ADHD.

I can work, concentrate and function now. Sometimes i have to use some tricks to get me back on track, i still wake up sometimes with thoughts racing and some days are a lot harder than others, but in january i get to a specialized doctor and maybe thats the start of getting medicated.

Stimulants, as you can imagine (because caffeine is a stimulant), are very effective in my case and i hope that i can get the treatment that i need.

I remember clearly a person saying (on this subreddit) that the caffeine addiction could hide something and now i'm sure that i know what he was meaning with that.

Take care and a happy new year for you guys.",10,1735546931.0,decaf,1,0.92,False

But my start was from a pre ground setup which I still use. Since I don’t have high end machine (delonghi ecp 31.21) i’m afraid to switch to whole beans and grinding them. The reason for confusion is also to whether get a ceramic bur or a metallic bur! I hope you all will guide me through this transition. ,2,1735546641.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False
