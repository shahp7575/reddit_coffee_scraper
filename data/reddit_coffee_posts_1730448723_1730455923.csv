1gh1zda,https://i.redd.it/a7f5ypwkl9yd1.jpeg,Spritzed Away My Money,"I bought a lot of mists and decants in the past 2 months. Someone please stop me ;-;

- VS Bare Vanilla Cashmere: Like a mist that is trying to be Vanilla 28, but not quite there. You can smell the orchids and patchouli in the background.
- SDJ 71: I’ve not been a fan of the SDJ series but this one is buttery caramel popcorn goodness. 
- Goldfield & Banks Silky Woods: Very much true to its name. Smooth smoky wood chips, like a fine whiskey with vanilla and saffron. Can’t wait to try Ingenious Ginger. 
- Burberry Goddess: This is a second try for me, and I do get the hype now. Florals with fluffy vanilla, very mass pleasing. Is it enough vanilla for me? Eh. But a nice office-friendly wear. 
- BBW Gingham Fresh: Sweet, juicy, friendly BBW mist. 
- Montale Vanilla Cake: Decadent Victoria sponge cake. It’s a royal vanilla cake I love it. 
- Serge Lutens Dent de Lait: With the metallic note, I was a bit scared of this one. But surprisingly not bad, it’s a little weird though. Like clean, almondy metal (?). 
- Prada Paradoxe: For a floral hater like me, this is surprisingly lovely. I can’t wait to try the Intense version. Is it basic? Yes. Am I basic? Yes. 
- D&G Devotion: Rich vanilla with lemon. It’s quite vanilla heavy, and gets a bit too dense for me at the end. Someone said the lemon is like Vim dish soap. Checks out, but it’s not bad at all. 
- Initio Absolute Aphrodisiac: Boozy, seductive, ambery vanilla. Very dark feminine energy, this one is sexy. 
- Mon Guerlain Intense: Lavender with vanilla. It’s like Burberry Goddess, but more powdery and lavendery. 
- Valentino BIR: Had to try some classics. This one is a clean, fruity scent. Like shampoo. 
- Al Maham Fragrances: I tried Jousset Le Tarte Tatin, Jousset Accident A La Vanille, Nishane Wulong Cha, Indult Tihota (to compare) and Santal 33 inspirations. I highly recommend them! Loved them all except for Tarte Tatin (too savoury and doesn’t mesh with the sweet pastry). Might have to do a separate review on these folks. 
- Tiziana Terenzi Cassiopea: Sweet, fruity, juicy candy. 
- Cacharel Yes I Am: I’m so enamoured by this brand. This scent is a very sweet, fruity, mass pleasing vanilla. 
- Teo Cabanel Cafe Cabanel: Fruity coffee with butter and cinnamon. 
- Phlur Vanilla Skin: Between Vanilla 28 and Bare Vanilla, I love this one. 
- Molton Brown Milk Musk: Lactonic, musky, fluffy vanilla. Love. 
- Initio Musk Therapy: Clean, soapy musk. 
- VS Almond Blossom and Oat Milk: Nutty, vanillic, floral milk goodness.

1gh1yjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1gh1yjj/my_recovery_after_the_surgery/,My recovery after the surgery,"I had the operation on 21 Oct Monday morning.

1st day was manageable pain and had mucous build up in my throat and I had the chronic problem before of postnasal drip which made it worse for me waking up at night choking on my own mucous and saliva, couldn't cough it out or sneeze because of the operation I feared I would open the wound and bleed. water ice cold  and food ( ice cream and jelly were my nutrition) 

Second day was little better perhaps becuse i stayed the night in hospital and they gave me iv paracetamol as well as antibiotics. And I was discharged in noon, food was the same but adding with it honey ( 2 spoon) and noodles without any spice added to it. Dr advice said I had to eat so  my throat muscles move which helped. Pain levels after eating is good but if I stayed 5h or 4h without eating it get more painful. I managed the pain with cold ice water sipping every time also with paracetamol as medication. Woke up at night because of mucous and saliva build up choking  had to drink water. 

3day was dont remember it much but started to eat scrambled eag and rice with yogurt. Wake up again at night. 

4 day by far the most painful day to me in my throat, I dont know why I just couldn't wait to eat the meds. Still wake up at  night to drink water. 

5,6 was good but my ear started to in pain as well which is most hateful pain for me after this operation next to the postnasal drip.waking up at night still.

7,8 now pain is very less and I don't think about much unless I try to talk and bit painful. Oh right by the way talking was better for me I started talking from first day but with difficulty and it gets  better even tho my voice was different and didn't regain my voice until the 10th day. Food was anything except spice seasoning and hot as well as crispy or crunchy tried ice coffe ( ice latte ) the taste was like metal and had weird feeling in my throat after drinking so couldn't drink it well. Ear pain still sucks. But didn't wake up at night had great sleep. 

9,10 the best days I fully recovered no pain still sometimes my ear hurt but less painful. And drink coffee was back to normal with taste  but my diet was still careful ( not eating anything that has spice or seasoned. And hot everything warm or cold no crispy food soft or solid ) and my throat has less to no more mucous and saliva build up. My voice back normal i can cough , sneeze normaly now with a bit pain. Still can't ywan without feeling pain tho, swallowing is good just weird and feeling like lump but probably my uvula being enlarged not of my throat. That it figured I share with you my experience since I learned from you guys a lot.

**“Most people have no idea how good their body is designed to feel” -Kevin Trudeau**

Unfortunately wine got its nasty grip on me and I slipped back into bad habits, then COVID came along, and well, the rest is history. But I am on Day 12 right now and I can tell you without a doubt (after many more lows and mortifying moments that brought me here), this time is for good.

Waking up today, after sleeping 8-10 hours a night for almost 2 weeks now, I can feel my body healing. I am not waking up nauseous. I am not waking up riddled with shame and guilt, checking my phone, wondering what fight I picked with my boyfriend in a drunk haze. I am not sore, my feet and belly are not swollen.

As I was making my coffee, that quote popped in my head. I know it only gets better from here. And if I keep drinking, it only gets worse. The choice is clear. I want better for myself. I want to know how good it can get.

1gh1w3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1gh1w3t/i_lost_over_7kg_16lbs_in_october_here_is_how_i/,I lost over 7kg (16lbs) in October. Here is how I did it.,"Hi, all!

Late 30s, F, 172cm / 5' 7""–8"".

SW Oct 1: 102.2kg / 225lbs. CW Nov 1: 94.8kg / 209lbs. Loss: 7.4kg / 16lbs. BMI: 34.5 > 32.

TW: 68kg / 150lbs. BMI: 23.

Background:

I was rather skinny as a teen. Gained some weight in my early 20s due to depression. I was able to lose it, took up running and did a few half-marathons, which I really enjoyed. I was never much of a gym bunny, but running made me feel free and gave me a high. However, being a parent to two kids starting from my late 20s, juggling work, home, and study, struggling with undiagnosed and untreated ADHD, CPTSD and depression and a relationship breakdown leading to divorce caused me to pile on the pounds, and mid-2023 after losing my job I weighed in at my heaviest – 105.5kg / 232lbs. At the start of Sep just gone I weighed in at 104kg / 229lbs and was determined to lose the weight after years of fluctuating, but never getting below 97kg / 213lb.

Sorry for the length of the below but I wanted to include everything that was helpful for me. It seems like a lot, but remember it's all about small, incremental, maintainable changes to your habits. My weight loss journey began in my head at least a half year before I enacted it in practice. And once I did the weight just fell off. I hope in 7–8 months I will be able to update here that I have reached my target. Good luck to us all! <3

What I did:

\- **Food diary/calorie counting.** I religiously wrote down everything I ate, weighing the food with a digital food weighing scales or digital weighing spoon. It was tedious in the beginning but I am mostly a creature of habit, so tend to eat the same foods over the course of a week, so once you work out a system that works for you (I use Excel at the moment, though I am a developer so am thinking of making myself an app) you can just easily reuse it. It was eye-opening how calorific my ""healthy"" foods were. (I had been eating very ""clean"" – don't smoke or drink, most stick to fish and white meat, lots of veg and fruit, veg/vegan meals. No greasy foods. No fizzy drinks. I drank sparkling water with a slice of lemon. My vices were bread, cheese and chocolate.) Learning how many calories were in dried fruit, nuts/seeds, vegan patties, dark chocolate, etc. was enlightening. It was like the ""Aha!"" moment for why I wasn't losing weight when I thought my diet was very healthy. I was taking in too many calories. Plain and simple. My maintenance starting out was \~ 2,300 and I aimed to hit 1,700. (In Nov I am aiming for 1,600.) Somedays I would only manage 1,400 and somedays I was 1,900, but over the course of a week I averaged 1,700. Listen to your body and if you had a low-calorie day the day before you might find yourself wanting a little more the next day. Be sensible. Try not to get carried away with calorie counting. It can easily turn into a game of seeing how little you can hit. The point is to life a healthier life, not to lose weight quickly. My deficit is between 800 and 400 / day. Average: \~600/day, \~4,000/week.

\- **Portion control.** I plate my meal before I go to the table to eat them. I use white, small bowls and plates so my food pops out and looks bigger. (The same amount of food on a coloured, bigger plate will look smaller and be less visible.) I don't have seconds. Now that I portion correctly I clear my plate and feel satisfied. Sometimes I feel like I want more, but I think about my progress to date, my goals, and I remind myself why I am doing this and how happier and better I already feel.

\- **No snacking.** I try and get all my food within my main meals of breakfast, lunch and dinner. Sometimes I will have my big meal at lunch time to avoid eating a lot of later in the day. I avoid eating after 8pm. If I do snack I have yogurt with a very small about of nuts and seeds and fruit. Nuts and seeds have healthy fats but they are also very high in calories, so be careful! Also fruit has fruit sugar. Sure, eating an apple or banana is better than a chocolate bar, but fruit should be seen as a treat. In time when your diet becomes less sugary your taste buds will acclimatise and come to find fruit to be very sweet and satisfying. Or I had chopped veg and a small amount of hummus. But really, I don't snack much now.

\- **Embrace feeling hungry.** I am obese. That's not an insult or a judgement. It's just a fact. I am still 6kg / 13lbs above the lower limit of obese and 21kg / 46lbs above the upper limit for health weight. I can afford to go to bed with a little grumble in my tummy. It is an uncomfortable feeling for the first 2 weeks or so, but embrace it as part of the journey. It takes about 2–3 weeks to form a habit. Your body will get used to feeling hungry. Have a drink of water with some lemon or cucumber. Chew gum. Listen to music. Water TV. 

\- **Being sensible on holiday.** During Oct I travelled internationally through airports and train stations for a week. I didn't track my food/calories during this time as I didn't have the opportunity or time, but I still managed to lose 1.5kg / 3lbs. I was sensible and tried to eat ""clean"" as much as possible – salad boxes without dressing. Little bread. Fisk and white meat. Choose sparkling water over juice or soda. I did allow myself one meal out and I had a vegetable curry without desert or starter, and treated myself to two locally-produced sodas during the meal as my host told me I must try it and it was a holiday after all.

\- **Mindfulness/therapy/CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy).** I learned in therapy to be mindful while I was eating. Over months I was able to break the link between my emotions and food. I used to eat to celebrate, eat to comfort me, eat when bored. Mindfulness and therapy helped me reprogram my brain to not turn to food when emotional or bored. I had a lot of ""food noise"". I grew up in a home where food was the centre of every celebration. You were told to clean your plate and then you could have a treat. At the age of 40 I have finally managed to break this link. No I am okay throwing away food if it is going bad (I don't eat it just to avoid wasting it). If I am not hungry I don't finish my plate. Over time you will buy only what you need and you will waste less. You owe it to yourself to be healthy, even if that means some food gets wasted. Overtime I have less and less ""food noise"".

\- **Light exercise.** Starting in April I began to work out in my living room by following simple cardio workouts designed for pregnant women or post-partum moms and yoga for beginners. When I had the routine down I would have the video play on silent and work out while I watched my favourite TV. Working out at home was convenient (no travel), and I wasn't self-conscious about others seeing me. In September last year I tried working out and in the first 10 minutes I hurt my back and couldn't walk for the rest of the day. That was how unfit I was. Today I can almost touch my toes from a standing position. I have more energy, I am more flexible. My breathing is easier and I have more stamina.

\- **Walking.** I walk 3–4 times a week, 4–5km (2.5–3 miles) every time. I walk to my favourite spot along this river. It's pretty, quiet. Sometimes I see a fox. There are ducks. It calms me.

\- **Treat yourself.** Treat yourself in ways other than food. Buy a new top or pair of jeans. See a film / movie in the cinema. (Bring a box of chopped carrots to snack on.) Browse the book shop and pick up a new book. Have a low-fat coffee out in the café and watch the world go by (extra points if you read a book). At the start of my journey I treated myself to Moomin chopping boards 

\- **Have fun.** Recently I started to have karaoke-dance sessions in my living room. Just me, a Spotify list and a willingness to be silly and sing and dance when no one is watching. It is lots of fun and gets you very sweaty.

\- **Having a goal:** My goal was having surgery. My surgeon wanted me to get down to 80kg / 176lbs before operating. When I first learned this the idea of having to lose 24kg / 53lbs seemed impossible. But I am well on my way now.

\- **Be positive,** believe in yourself and praise yourself. Having self-belief is so important. You need to believe you can do it and be your biggest champion. Shut down the negative self-talk. Promote positive self-talk.

\- **Throw perfectionism out the window.** Not every day will be perfect, but the journey is long and a few slip ups here and there in the grand scheme of things don't matter. Be kind and compassionate towards yourself. Just don't allow a slip to turn into a habit.

\- **Learn about habit formation.** I read books on habit formation and the key take away is that in order to form long-term, maintainable habits you need to: 1) create an environment that makes the action easy to take, 2) learn your triggers for the action, 3) break down the action into small steps that build up over time. Focus less on the end goal and instead focus on the small things you can do everyday that embody the person you want to be. You want to be a writer? What would a writer do? You want to be a fit and healthy person? Ask yourself what would that kind of person do in this scenario and then do that. Sweat the small stuff and the gains will come.

\- **Medication.** As mentioned above, I have ADHD, CPTSD and depression. I went to therapy and got medicated for my depression and ADHD. I did inner child work. Being medicated versus not is night and day. I am able to keep my living space clean and organised. I am able to plan. I am able to get my work and tasks done. I have decreased my anxiety and sense of overwhelm. Between medication and therapy my ability to keep up with life and my outlook on life has radical changed for the better. Now I have grief over the lost decades but I hope that the decades ahead will be 100 times better.

\- **What I eat.** This is very specific to everyone, so that is why it is all the way down here, but if anyone is curious: Breakfast is either porridge + peanut butter + fruit, or granola + yogurt + seeds + fruit. Lunch is salmon/tuna/chicken with a green salad of lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, bell pepper, white/goat's cheese, seeds. Dinner is chicken with mixed veg and brown rice, or chickpeas and mixed veg and buckwheat/quinoa , or chicken in oat cream with oyster/brown/chanterelle mushrooms. Snacks (if I have them) are yogurt with fruit and nuts/seeds, chopped carrots and cucumber + hummus. If I am treating myself – a square of dark chocolate, half a handful of grapes or chocolate covered dried chickpeas. My diet is ""plant-strong"" + cheese + fish+chicken. I used to be a vegan and before that a vegetarian/pescetarian. So while I no longer apply a label to my diet, I do enjoy and prefer vegan or vegetarian meals. I add cheese/fish/meat for healthy reason not really because I enjoy them, but of course baked or grilled fish or goat's cheese is delicious, ngl.",2,1730455424.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,1.0,False

Coffee, hot chocolate and a few flavoured coloured liquids I affectionately call Orange and green. A lot of people complain about how bad the coffee is from it. But I didn’t mind. I was use to it as it’s the only source of liquid consumption for half a mile. Not counting the protein enriched tap water. 

However after the closure of the 4th floor which had a pristine new looking vending mc left abandoned. So facilitates thought they would be extra helpful and give us the new vending mc throwing away the old one. Not realising that theirs a reason it was abandoned. The stuff it produced was complete pig swill. The hot chocolate just gave us boiled milk. Orange and green was just ever so lightly flavoured water. And the coffee never worked. No matter how many time we got the engineer In. 

So now I have to go through the day with no cold liquids, no coffee. No caffeine. I basically begged and pleaded with them to get the old vending mc back. But once it’s gone. It’s gone. 
Heaven please save us from those that wish to do me a favour. Honestly I think this might be the breaking point to find another job. 
Am I overreacting? I mean if they let us have a kettle and fridge in our room. I’ll make make my own. But all my complaints fall on death ears.

1gh1tpj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gh1tpj,My thoughts on the Mazzer Philos and the Conical to Flats Journey,"Hey espresso community :) 

Just thought about structuring my thoughts on the recently launched Mazzer Philos grinder, and how it has enlighten me on Conicals vs Flat Burrs, as someone who started my home barista journey about 1 year ago :)

I recently changed my Varia VS3 Gen 2, a conical Burr grinder, that I absolutely loved and still do, for the Mazzer Philos. For a while, I had this thought planted in my brain, that flat burrs would be drastically different... That they would provide me the ""true"" espresso and ""filter"" experience (I use aeropress, not sure if it classifies as ""filter"" :P, but I guess it's similar in many ways ;)). For context, I also roast my own coffee at home, using a Behmor 2000, and I've tried pretty much all coffee origins at different roast levels... and I always had this though about, am I missing something from these great origins with a conical? 

I loved the coffee I brewed, honestly, if you're looking for a prosumer entry-level grinder, the Varia VS3 with hypernova ultra-s burrs will put a 😏 smile on your face many many times! The espressos were velvety and sirupy, and the acidity was high enough but balanced with a very good sweetness. But a thought kept haunting me... I cannot super clearly distinguish the notes from each other... I can taste orange vs brown sugar, but I cannot taste orange vs cherry blossom when those supposed notes were there in the coffee. Damn you clarity!!! 😅 The community have created this thought in my head that flat burrs will give me this insane clarity that you can't get with a conical Burr. But the other part of my brain always thought ""you're exaggerating, the Varia is conical but it's a low rpm one, which puts it in this very special spot between a conical and a flat..."". 

Here comes my stubbornness on proving I was right or wrong and my endless consumption of YouTube flat burr grinder reviews, flats vs Conicals and ""clarity in coffee"" videos. During those funny times and honestly great learning process, after several reviews of the DF64v, DF83v, Zernos, etc... it enters the Mazzer Philos! I felt in love with the grinder right away! The design, the industrial feeling to it, the encouragement to not use RDT with it (never liked the RDT in the workflow but always did it), the absence of bellows, the low retention, the vertically perfectly aligned already seasoned 64mm burrs (no need for SSP burrs), and the fact that it has a very aggressive launch price (meaning it will likely become more expensive), among many others led me to choose this grinder for my first flat burr friend.

It's curious because it was not like I saw the reviews and immediately chose it, because I was going to buy the DF64v or DF83V, because they had variable rpm, were smaller (which mattered a lot to me in the previous setup I had in my kitchen) or had bigger burrs in the case of the 83... And the Zernos availability and more expensive price were enough to put me away. I would then install some SSP burrs in one of those DF grinders... and once again, it came another rabbit hole, which ones? Multipurpose (MP) or High Uniformity (HU)? If I'm seeking clarity why the hell would I go for the HU? Will I basically end up with a flat grinder delivering me exactly the same as the conical (but kind of flat because of low rpm) Varia? Many days after, and after doing lots of SWAT analysis, I don't know how but the Philos started to get more and more in implanted in my brain althought it lacked some features compared to the DF grinders. Part of me just wanted industrial beautiful design and robustness and, more important than ever to me, having tried many workflows, the most simple workflow I could get. 

After two weeks with the Mazzer Philos, having bought the 200d burrs (an hybrid between the SSP MP and the SSP HU, modern espresso - medium light driven) and the 189d - not tried yet - (similar to SSP HU, traditional espresso driven), I can say I'm ""realistically and consciously in love"" 😍 what do I mean by this? I want to set things straight from the beginning, a flat burr (using the Philos here as my only experience) compared to a great conical like the Varia WILL NOT make you go like ""wow this is night and day"", unless you're probably cupping with the two side by side. Also, it WILL NOT make you go ""wow I can now finally taste the lemon pie note in my coffee instead of just an acidic lemony note"". It WILL however make you go ""Damn they were right! I can now feel the clarity bump, I can taste different notes more clearer, I don't get as much of that muddy/blended flavors, and the acidity to sweetness balance is just perfect"". 

For any espresso lovers going throught the same questions I was going, I want to be realistic here. The differences were marginal to me, but was it the marginal bump I was looking for? Was it worth it? Yes, it was! It was exactly what I was looking for! I payed the price of counter space though (as you can see in the picture, needed to be creative with the setup orientation) 😂 

All the Mazzer Philos qualities I mentioned above are true in real life. It's a pleasure to use, the workflow is so streamlined, the coffee is DELICIOUS, and it will look damn beautiful in your kitchen! The grinder is consistent, it made me go with stepped adjustments again, just because I love those clucky sounds ♥️ The i200d burrs, they are amazing, they give you the true promised flat burr profile, where clarity is top notch, acidity is high, which I love, but balanced in the most sweetest (I mean this things are sweet!) way possible and with a velvety texture (not conical level texture though - for that go with the i189d where texture/body and sweeteness are the priority). Can say the hype train for the Mazzer Philos with the i200d for modern espresso is definitely real. 

But jumping down of the train a bit, again the questions: ""will this make me taste all the individual notes in the coffee label?"" ""Will this be drastically different from the coffee from the Varia VS3 I remember weeks ago?"". Realistically and Consciously in love with this grinder, I have to say no to both ;) specially for people using the i189d that I'll try later, I would say that difference should be even less noticeable. However, will I buy it again with the i200d burrs for the best espresso and aeropress I have ever tasted with the most streamlined workflow? absolutely freaking yes! The Mazzer Philos is definitely one of the best value for money prosumer grinders out there (that maybe even will bump up in value once launch campaigns are over). 

So my final conclusion is, are you obsessing with getting a grinder in the 500 to 1K range to give you a bump in clarity and one of the nicest balance between acidity, sweetness and texture, with a streamlined workflow, that looks beautiful in the kitchen, with no constraints on counter space? then definitely look for the Mazzer Philos. Are you going to plan buying a grinder just because you believe it will really make you taste that lemon pie vs a lemon? Or that freshly picked strawberry vs raspberry? Unless you really have impressive taste buds, I really think that coffee label notes are guides for acidity and sweetness levels, nothing more, and no grinder will allow you to do that. Don't obsess about coffee notes (great video on the topic here: https://youtu.be/wg1095Tc9j4?si=FzSPdcf2nN49H11J)

Use natural, question-based keywords that match how people speak, like “best ways to improve fitness” instead of “fitness improvement tips.”
Long-tail keywords are essential, as voice searches are usually longer and more specific.

Optimize for Question-Based Content

Structure content to answer common questions directly, as voice searches often involve phrases like “how,” “what,” and “why.”
Include a FAQ section on relevant pages to cover multiple questions in one place.

Create Concise, Direct Answers

Voice search often pulls short, direct answers from content. Aim for brief, informative responses at the beginning of each section or paragraph.
Featured snippets or ""position zero"" content is a great target for voice search optimization.

Improve Mobile Friendliness and Site Speed

Most voice searches come from mobile devices, so make sure your site is responsive and quick to load.
Optimize images, enable caching, and consider using a CDN to ensure fast mobile performance.

Focus on Local SEO

Many voice searches are local, such as “coffee shops near me.” Include location-based keywords in your content, and keep your Google My Business listing updated.
Adding localized content, such as city names or nearby landmarks, can help capture local voice searches.

Use Structured Data (Schema Markup)

Structured data helps search engines understand your content, making it easier for voice search to pull accurate information.
Implement schema for your business info, services, reviews, and FAQs to improve voice search visibility.

Optimize for Featured Snippets

Featured snippets are the most common voice search results, so structure your content to answer questions in a clear, concise way.
Aim to answer questions within 30-50 words to increase chances of appearing in voice search results.

Enhance Content Readability

Keep sentences short and easy to understand, as voice search prefers content that’s simple and conversational.

Use subheadings, lists, and bullet points to improve readability and make content scannable.

I’m 23 and supposed to be graduating from college with a useless liberal arts degree in another semester, maybe two. I have somehow managed to accumulate $50k in student debt because every adult in my life basically let me throw away my life believing that the ends (a degree) justify the means (insurmountable debt). 

I was a freshman when COVID happened and it basically completely altered the course of my life, I took a break from school for a bit to work a management position at a chain coffee establishment (the one that loves Israel) and I was actually making somewhat decent money before I blew up my life by quitting that job, going back to school, and getting a different job bartending elsewhere. I often think back on that job, though, and how the only thing in my life I ever worried about was making it to work on time and paying my bills. Looking back on it, it almost seems preferable to all of the debt I’ve accumulated since.

I have a fake work-from-home job now that pays me less but is really easy and hopefully looks better on a resume. I didn’t get this job because of any pedigree or active job seeking, it’s a nepo job with my parents’ company where I’m in direct contact with them most days as part of the job. 

I’ve destroyed basically every romantic relationship I’ve ever been involved in out of pure hubris and some compulsion that makes me push other people away because I hate myself (or something like that, I’m not a psychiatrist). I have very few friends and spend most of my time on online forums (this is one of them). I don’t exercise regularly, I barely know how to cook, and I smoke pot pretty regularly. Lately I’ve been picking up a drinking habit as well, which is a bit concerning. I live in a small apartment with the cheapest furniture imaginable and a cat, who I feel I disappoint by being a terrible owner despite how much I love him. I don't think I've slept a full night in months, it's standard for me to wake up *at least* once in the middle of each night.

Anyways. That’s it. I’m trapped in a hell of my own making, I’ve fucked around and squandered basically every opportunity I had to do something with an education or form any kind of long term, meaningful romantic entanglement. I'm poorer than I was two years ago when I was working what basically amounted to fast food wage slavery. My college degree is a joke and I have no prospects with debt that I'll likely never be able to repay. I keep trying to detach myself from desire i.e. detach myself from suffering but I simply can't. I don't understand people who don't think about killing themselves constantly, it feels like I've pretty much wasted this life and a re-roll is in order if I want to do things ""right"" next time around, or I just become nothing which is okay with me too.

I’m 34M from Britain (England). I’m open to meeting new people to hang out and socialise with, and making new friends. I am a caring, kind, honest, loyal, patient, and sociable person and it would be great to meet other people with the same qualities. It would be great to build close male friendships with other guys, where you can chat/call, and socialise in person. I am particularly keen to meet other guys from Britain, as it would be great to have a friend who is in same country geographically, and where you can chat and meet up in person  regularly where possible and do different social activities together, e.g going to gym/working out, playing sports together, going to socialise at pubs and restaurants etc, going out for coffee etc. 


If anyone is interested in chatting and looking for the same, please feel free to send me a message anytime. It would be great to hear from you, and connect.

Anyone try Fodzyme?

Any other suggestions?

Coffee seems to be a trigger for me, even though it’s not a FODMAP.  It’s so hard to stay away.  I switch to tea, but sometimes coffee is the only thing that does the trick to keep me alert and functioning to tackle my day.

1gh1jte,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1gh1jte/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1gh1i7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1gh1i7h/wotl_chapter_10_precipice/,WoTL Chapter 10 Precipice ,"The first rays of dawn broke over the quiet streets as Cassy stepped out of the carriage, weary from the long night. He dusted off his jacket and paid the fare, glancing up at the looming Blackstone building with a hesitant smile. Today's a new day, he thought, hoping it held fewer confrontations at gunpoint than yesterday.

Whistling a tune from the backstreets of Kensington, he walked up the steps and entered the office.

At the front desk, Rochelle was having her morning tea, her hazel eyes warm against the dimness of the lobby. Cassy felt a stir of nervousness—a rarity for him—and gave her a polite nod.

""Good morning, Caspian,"" she greeted, her voice soft yet grounded. ""The captain's in his office. Coffee and tea are around the corner in the break room if you'd like some.""

""Thank you, Rochelle,"" he replied, keeping his tone even as he masked his nerves. There was a peculiar sense of calm here, different from the chaos he'd grown up in. It felt almost… steady.

The break room was modest—a few chairs, a scratched table piled with worn newspapers, and the lingering aroma of old coffee. Cassy poured himself a cup, savoring its bitterness, then steeled himself and walked to the captain's office.

""Come in,"" the captain called as Cassy knocked.

Inside, the captain's expression was hard, yet a glint of curiosity flickered in his eyes. Cassy squared his shoulders, pushing away any hesitation.

""Good morning, captain,"" he said, the words a little too eager.

The captain's gaze bore into him, assessing. After a beat, he gave a curt nod. ""Good. Now, here's what you'll need to know."" He didn't waste words, listing details as though they were facts, not open for debate. ""You've been granted a stipend and a terrace house. Pick up the key from Rochelle. Your rent comes out of your pay, effective immediately.""

Cassy's relief was palpable. ""Thank you, sir. You've no idea how dreadful last night was.""

""Oh, I think I might,"" the captain replied, his mouth quirking ever so slightly. ""Now, as of today, you'll be paired with Jack. He's to be respected, regardless of any, ah, 'prickly' edges he may have.""

""Understood, sir.""

The captain leaned back, folding his arms. ""Usually, new recruits undergo physical training, but I've heard of your… background. So instead, I'll expect you to attend firearm courses. Go to the Angry Bear pub and ask for 'bird-watching classes.' That'll get you in.""

Cassy winced, remembering yesterday's misunderstanding with Maple. ""Yes, sir,"" he replied, a touch of guilt creeping in.

""One more thing,"" he added, choosing his words carefully. ""I've come across information… Sleeping Forest Hunters, Nest and Purity, are searching around Kensington for someone named 'Maple.'""

The captain's face darkened, his fingers instinctively finding his pipe as he absorbed the information. ""Interesting,"" he muttered. After a pause, his expression shifted, and he looked Cassy over. ""Have you considered joining the supernatural world? I wouldn't usually suggest it for someone so new, but your circumstances… They make you a candidate.""

Cassy took a steadying sip of his coffee, the bitterness settling his nerves. A marked man with a cursed ring, he thought grimly. If the supernatural could buy me some time, maybe even a bit of safety…

""Yes,"" he said. ""Seeing Jack's powers firsthand… It's hard to refuse. And considering the dangers we're dealing with, I'll need every advantage I can get.""

The captain nodded, a hint of satisfaction in his gaze. ""Smart. Descent is not without risks, but it grants strength to those who can wield it. Speak with Henry down the hall; he'll administer the potion. But be warned—don't take everything he says to heart.""

""Understood, captain."" Cassy rose and gave a respectful nod. ""May the Mother guide us.""

""May the Mother guide us all,"" the captain responded solemnly.

He walked to Henry's door and knocked. Silence.

""Knock knock.""

Nothing.

Odd.

""Knock knock.""

""Oi, quit that blasted knocking! Door's stuck; lift it up when you pull!"" a gruff voice shouted from inside.

Cassy reached for the knob, heaving it upwards as he opened it. The door gave way, and he was met with the sight of a stocky, bald man—older than anyone Cassy had seen survive in the slums—standing there with a look of eternal irritation.

""Morning, Henry,"" Cassy said, stepping inside. ""I'm here for my descent potion.""

Henry's scowl deepened, and he muttered something under his breath. ""What's so good about it? Get in here.""

The room looked like an alchemist's nightmare. Shelves sagged under the weight of jars, beakers, and mysterious herbs. Thick volumes stacked in precarious towers, while the desk was a chaos of powders, vials, and an assortment of strange objects. At the center was a simmering cauldron, the vapor carrying an unmistakable metallic tang.

""Now, what do you think you're after, lad?"" Henry said, taking his seat with a creak. ""Descent's not a small thing. And the toll it takes… well, that's for you to find out.""

Cassy stood firm. ""I'm ready.""

Henry raised an eyebrow, reaching into a drawer to pull out a worn, folded parchment. ""Take a look,"" he said, thrusting it at Cassy.

Unfolding it, Cassy scanned the list of paths.

Jester. Farseer. Scribe. Priest. Apothecary.

Jester: an incredibly well-rounded path capable of emulating any abilities from other descenders. As their step rises, they gain the ability to store more abilities. At step 9, they are capable of storing two abilities, one-time use each.

Farseer: capable of receiving revelations from past, present, or future depending on their inclination and medium. They are reasonably reliable within their domains. Farseers should be wary of seeing what they should not. When one gazes upon the abyss, so too does it gaze upon them. Do not take these words lightly.

Scribe: capable of wielding a myriad of elemental magicks, easily the most potent combat path in isolation. However, they are infallible due to the large amount of essence each spell requires; they cannot maintain offense for long periods.

Priest: capable of conjuring large ethereal barriers blocking both the mundane and mystical with ease. Skilled priests are able to move such barriers, turning them into offensive tools. They are known as the shields of the mystical world.

Apothecary: gifted with uncanny knowledge related to all living things. They have extremely precise insight into the nature of life, allowing them to heal and mend living beings typically through the use of herbs and animal parts. However, they are also the most capable surgeons in existence, among other things.

Cassy's eyes drifted over each option, but something drew him to one in particular.

Jester.

A path for the nimble-minded. Unpredictable, flexible, able to mimic and store abilities. It felt like a natural choice.

""I'll take the Jester potion,"" he declared, looking Henry dead in the eye.

The old man snorted, a glint of reluctant admiration showing. ""A Jester, eh? Most pick it for the tricks, not knowing it's the weakest in terms of raw power."" He looked Cassy up and down, eyes narrowing. ""A mind like yours, though… You might make it work. Once you take it, lad, there's no going back.""

Cassy nodded. ""I know.""

Henry hobbled around his office, collecting various ingredients from the walls and chests.

""Bloody hell, that's an eyeball, is it? How am I meant to drink that?"" Cassy thought, a mix of curiosity and apprehension washing over him.

""This is it,"" he mused, realizing that his life was on the brink of a monumental change. ""But do I really want to do this? What if I can't handle the consequences?""

Henry glanced over, noticing the conflict etched on Cassy's face. ""You don't have to rush into this, lad. It's a significant step. Once you choose, there's no turning back.""

Cassy straightened, determination and uncertainty battling within him. ""I—I need to think it over. It's not a decision to take lightly.""

""Fair enough,"" Henry replied, his tone shifting to one of understanding. ""But the clock is ticking. You may not have much time to prepare.""

Cassy's heart raced at the implication. ""What do you mean?""

Henry's expression turned serious. ""The Hunters are drawing closer. If you don't act soon, you might lose your chance to protect yourself.""

A chill ran down Cassy's spine. The weight of the moment pressed heavily on his chest.

""Very well,"" he said, the urgency propelling him forward. ""I'm ready.""

Henry raised an eyebrow, a glint of mischief in his gaze. ""Then let's get started. But remember, once we begin brewing, there's no turning back.""

Cassy felt a rush of adrenaline. ""Then let's do it.""

As Henry began to gather the ingredients, the air thick with anticipation, Cassy couldn't shake the feeling that he was stepping into a whirlwind—one that would change everything he knew.",1,1730453682.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1gh1hoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cordials/comments/1gh1hoo/hypercube_cola/,Hypercube Cola,"I'm still experimenting with the cola flavour - this time I went back to the original one I tried a year ago, Cube Cola, but with some modifications from the things I've learned along the way. It's getting closer to the flavour I want each time.

The imitation coca leaf flavour really helps boost the bitter aspect, and the lime juice & vanilla really round off the flavour. 

This flavour base will make \~135 litres of cola syrup or almost 4500 litres of drink.

# Flavour base

* 7.50 ml orange oil 
* 7.00 ml lime oil 
* 2.00 ml lemon oil 
* 1.50 ml nutmeg oil 
* 0.75 ml cassia oil 
* 0.50 ml coriander oil
* 0.50 ml neroli oil (can substitute with petitgrain if neroli is too expensive) 
* 0.25 ml lavender oil

Add each of these oils into 250ml of 95% alcohol and shake well to mix. Allow to age in a cool, dark place for 1+ week (the longer the better - ideally 3 weeks at a minimum).

# Coca leaf substitute

* 100ml alcohol
* 65g Yerba Mate
* 35g Bay leaf

Grind the leaves as fine as possible and soak in the alcohol for 1+ week. Filter well through coffee paper.

# Syrup

* 800g white sugar
* 450ml water

Boil the water and pour over the sugar. Stir well until clear and cool. Then add:

* 15ml caramel colouring (E150d)
* 2.5ml 75% phosphoric acid (or 2.5g citric acid)
* 20ml lime juice
* 10ml vanilla extract
* 30ml filtered coca leaf substitute
* 300mg (0.3g) caffeine powder dissolved throughly in 10ml hot water (add when cool and filtered).
* 2ml flavour base

Let this age for a few days at a minimum before using. 

Dilute 1:5 with ice cold sparkling water.

I'm going to experiment with cherry and vanilla versions of this recipe at some point.

This is not the first time. I think is not normal for couples to be upset and separated for a holiday after a huge fight. Maybe once… but I feel like at least once a year this happens.

I was yesterday with him in a concert I gifted him for his birthday. Very special: VIP tickets with a meet and greet and signed items of his favorite band. We decided to travel to a city we’ve never been before to make the experience even cooler.

We’re at the concert and he’s talking about how he feels about his body and getting old. I feel like he’s struggling a bit with his self image lately and he’s a bit harsh on himself so I try to hype him up. Then he comments on how I have a muffing top like him. I get upset because honestly I weight 105lbs and of course I could be slimmer and stronger but telling me I have a muffing top?! Honestly man! He apologizes and tells me I’m beautiful and I let it go. The concert starts and he’s having fun. I don’t love this band but I’m happy he’s happy, I’m dancing but staying in a part I feel comfortable while he goes to the mosh pit. Then a song I really like starts and I tell him: ‘this is the best song ever’ and dance and I should have known something was up with him because he responds: ‘are you being sarcastic?’ And I’m very confused and say that no, that I love it. And he also comes to me a couple times to ask if I’m still angry (I told him that everything is fine and kiss him back).

So after the concert ends he’s furious with me. About how I ruined his night for a stupid comment he made and I’m honestly baffled because I felt fine? He starts talking about other times that I have done this and is a big problem. This has happened before at other concerts and it makes me feel terrible whenever he tells me I ruin everything because something made me feel sad. It makes me feel super anxious and guilty. I always feel very bad later. Like I ruin everything. The thing is this time… I feel different about it. Like I should be able to feel whatever I do if I’m able to handle it like an adult. Process my feelings, and we could still enjoy the evening. He tells me I should not say anything to not ruin his special night and I should talk about it the next day. of course this is the best thing I could do but I don’t think how I reacted was anything too crazy… I should have assured him more but at the same time I don’t think I was being moody or anything. I honestly felt fine. He days I’m lying and I hate it… I know how I felt. I could have handled it better but I don’t think this deserves such a big reaction afterwards. I really feel sorry for making him feel bad in such a special night (I really tried to make a special birthday for him), and I know I can handle myself better and I should work on myself, but I don’t know. I don’t know what to do.

He has grown a lot after years together, I love him very much but I’m exhausted. I used to feel so sad in these fights but know I’m just tired.

Sorry for the long post but I needed to vent. I’m alone in a coffee shop right now with no one to talk to. ",1,1730453528.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

I have always slept badly since I got sober nearly 6 years ago now. Recently I’ve noticed on the days I’ve had more caffeine later in the day I’ve actually slept better.

For example I usually have an energy drink and a strong coffee and cut off at about 1030am

The last couple of times I’ve broken that I’ve had an extra coffee around midday or another energy drink in the early afternoon.

It’s taken a while for me to realise but  I’ve slept way better on those nights.

I have had vyvanse for about a year now and altough I always loved how it made my mornings and the first 4 hours of my day super easy, that was about the only benefit I got. The rest was horrible anxiety, wearing off of it super fast and literally just feeling out of myself for the rest of the day. Then I decided to give it a go, and see if it helps to take it in an empty stomach and it did WONDERS. 

Now I take it 1 hour before waking up, then wait for another hour before eating. I eat a small breakfast and avoid caffeine until like lunch time so instead of coffee I drink tea for my breakfast. It also gives me a better appetite overall. Now I have no idea why it works, but it really does. The effects are so much smoother, last throughout the day, it literally cures my anxiety instead of doubling it and overall I feel great. (I’m on 50mg)

So IF your vyvanse is not working the way you want it to, change your diet and eating schedule and see if that will help. ",4,1730452542.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

Hey Reddit! So, life’s taken a bit of a turn recently. I went through a breakup that’s left me single for the first time in a long while. It’s been a few months now, and I’m definitely ready to open up and see what’s out there. Honestly, I’m just looking to meet some cool people—whether we end up as friends, something more, or just have some interesting conversations.

It’s been a weird experience adjusting to single life, and I won’t lie: the drought is real. It’s been a while since I’ve had that spark and intimacy with someone, and yeah, it’s been a little rough. But I also know I don’t want to rush into anything just for the sake of it. I’m open to exploring and seeing where things naturally lead, but I’m also genuinely interested in connecting on a real level.

What I bring to the table? Well, for starters, I’m a good listener (breakup pro-tip: listening is everything!). I’m respectful, pretty chill, and I know how to have fun, whether we’re just hanging out, talking about life, or going deeper (in every sense of the word).

I’m looking for people who want to chat, vibe, and maybe even grab coffee or drinks if we hit it off. Who knows? Maybe we end up as friends, maybe we have a fling, or maybe something more. I’m all about keeping things honest and open. Just seeing where things go, no pressure.

So, if you’re looking to connect with someone who’s genuine, single, and open to exploring whatever this new phase brings, let’s talk. Drop me a message, or just say hey in the comments—I’m here for it!",0,1730452104.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,0.5,False
1gh15pm,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1gh15pm/confusional_arousal/,Confusional Arousal,"I have only just learned the name for this, and I definitely suffer with it. 

I experience confusional arousal daily, and have done for as long as I can remember. Waking up in the morning is easily the most stressful part of my day. The experience often feels like I'm doing some kind of puzzle, or am in some kind of fight, where the stakes feel existential - as though the task needs to be done to prevent the end of the world. It sounds strange to write it like that, but that's the feeling I get most mornings. It's not a conscious, explicit thing, but rather something I feel. 

I regularly have full blown conversations and arguments with my wife when I'm trying to wake up. She gets understandably frustrated that I don't wake up to alarm #12 + her constant interventions, and I will respond with anger and frustration that I still *feel* when I'm up, but can't rationally explain. In my teens, I'd have similar experiences with my Mum. I'm currently in my mid-thirties, and as I said, I have been this way as long as I can remember. 

On getting out of bed, my head is usually spinning and I struggle to speak coherently. I will be very clumsy and struggle to orient myself. This lasts between 10-30 minutes, and is helped by things like showering, drinking coffee, vaping at the back door and browsing my phone. My Mum recently visited and got upset with me because she kept asking me questions as soon as I was up and I couldn't organise what she was saying in my head or muster a coherent response. She took it quite personally, even after I explained to her what was going on. She said she felt like she wasn't welcome in our house as I was being 'stroppy' with her. I genuinely wasn't. I was cognitively impaired at the time. 

I have been prescribed Quetiapine (an anti-psychotic/mood stabilizer) since my early twenties. According to the psychiatrists at the time, I suffered with 'psychosis' which could be indicative of something like Bipolar or Schizophrenia, but they didn't want to label it at that time and I've since been discharged. I don't do well without the meds, so I've been on them now for well over a decade. For a number of reasons, I'm quite sure I suffer with Bipolar disorder, but no longer have any psychiatric support and am independently stable on my meds. I now only take a low dose, but I decline without it. 

The meds definitely contribute to the confusional arousal, but they are not the cause (as it began and was consistent long before them). The time I take the meds is a factor. If I take them early, I'm asleep earlier and go through the process of confusional arousal earlier in the morning. Later meds means more difficultly waking at a reasonable hour. I've experimented with this a few times and it's a consistent pattern. However, the symptoms are always there when it's time to wake up. I come out of it a little quicker after taking my meds early, probably because I've simply had more sleep. 

If I'm left to my own devices, and have no need to wake up, I can sleep for more than 12 hours. I will still experience confusional arousal, but nowhere near as severely. Obviously, this is almost never an option. But even if it was, I'd still have issues with CA. In these rare cases, I will still have vague memories of 'fighting' my way out of sleep, and will have vague recollections of several occurrences of this where I'm *almost* waking up but still 'trapped' in sleep. 

Overall, it's a very stressful and upsetting start to *every* day. It makes me feel incompetent and pathetic. Loved ones have often said things like ""*just get up*"", like it's a choice I'm making. It's difficult to articulate to them what I have to go through to become conscious enough to make such a decision. And by that point, I'm very upset and sometimes don't want to face the world. I feel genuine and extreme fear, anxiety and anger during this process. By the time I'm awake, I can't consciously understand what I'm fearful, anxious or angry about, but the emotion is still very much present and takes some time to shake. I can definitely react unreasonably as a result, at least from the perspective of others. So I don't blame them at all, but I also find it difficult to honestly blame myself. I don't know how to resolve this. 

I'd honestly welcome suggestions from anyone here. But my main motivation for writing this here is to share, reflect and formalise my feelings on this. Hopefully someone else will read it and recognise their these symptoms, leading to some positive progress with their own experiences. 

Is my experience common? Do others recognise what I'm saying? *Anyone have a miracle cure*? 

Happy to answer any questions. 

Thanks for reading if you got this far.

He asked the guy to move but he refused and somehow that was that.

""So what now?"" I asked

""You can find another seat but I have no power to move him, only the police and move him and they will not turn up just to move someone out of a seat.""

There were no seats free in the carriage and probably not many free on the train so standing to London was a possibility.

""I'm going to take a seat in first class"" - better surroundings, power sockets and free tea and coffee.

Hi all,

Yonder is a lifestyle credit card which provides points to spend on ‘experiences’ such as restaurant meals, flights, coffee, flowers, delivery food services, trips away (such as log cabins and Wellness retreats) and much more - **it changes every month**!

If you sign up via my referral link (here: [https://join.yondercard.com/bhdfbyx](https://join.yondercard.com/bhdfbyx)) you will get 10,000 points (worth approximately **£50 in credit** towards various experiences, dependent on experience chosen, in cities of London, Manchester, Birmingham Bristol and Bath, or towards the **online experiences** such as flights - therefore can be used in any city, no matter where you live!).

On top of this, some other perks of the card and referral include:

* you will be able to claim 3 months *premium* membership for **free** which provides **worldwide family travel insurance** when booking travel on the card and also 5 points per £1 spent.
* From my rough calculations, this correlates to somewhere in the region of 2 to 3% cash back dependent on the experience
* You’ll also be able to get Mastercard foreign exchange fees (i.e essentially the best fees you can get when abroad, akin to cards like Chase/Monzo/Revolut) and purchase protection.

To sign up, you can go through the referral link (or any referral link!) and follow the steps. They will run a soft credit check to determine if you’re eligible and then if so will run a hard check as with all credit cards to determine your credit allowance (but only after running the soft check to tell you if you meet their eligibility requirements).

You can also cancel before the 3 months premium ends to avoid the subscription renewing and once you’ve spent all the points on experiences, and switch to a free card or just cancel the card.

On the whole I’m really enjoying Yonder and hope you will too! I’m enjoying so much so that I’m I've continued using the subscription after my first 3 months premium free (and I also use it on top of my AMEX). The nice thing is it tends to be **accepted everywhere** that AMEX is not (because it's Mastercard) and you can spend abroad without a transaction fee.

We continued to chat occasionally and a casual convo.

After that day, we were messaging each other more frequently and sharing things about the day - work, food, colleagues, friends etc. it went on for about two weeks. 

Suddenly she messages only if I message her first. I respect her so I don't message her too frequently, may be once a day or once in few days.

- sharing about her yoga teacher is back and she spent time talking to him after class 
- sharing about her past love life experience and why she is single
- asking me on why I am single and what I look for

That was her only tonic clonic, the other seizures have just been absence seizures.  
This week her lamictal was upped by 50 mg due to having lots of seizure activity in her frontal lobe in her last MRI a few weeks ago. A few days ago she started complaining of lots of headaches and was extremely tired. We both chalked it up to the adjustment to her new dose. 
She woke up Tuesday morning saying she felt much better. She brewed coffee, got the mail, did all her normal things. We were watching tv in the living room and suddenly said she felt really dizzy and her vision was double. She’s never had double vision before and it concerned me immediately, within a minute of her saying this she stood up and fell into the coffee table and her speech was slurred in a way I had never heard before. I helped her get on to the couch and her speech got increasingly more slurred and hard to understand within seconds.
She was conscious and aware the whole time but she was saying the same few things like in a loop. She remembers herself laughing hysterically while I ran upstairs to change, I told her I was going to call 911 and she started screaming no over and over. I put on a pair of jeans, preparing us to go to the hospital and they showed up within 10 minutes. They heard her slur her birthday and name they told her they were going to take her to the hospital and they carried her out. She was agreeable and answered all their questions but was really out of it and could hardly speak. Her mouth was numb but it wasn’t specific to one side and she was as aware of everything. She could smile evenly, moved her arms and legs the way they wanted and passed every memory test including what our address was. On the way outside she made sure to tell them what hospital she wanted to go to, told me to fill our cats water dishes, lock our front door, etc. 
They treated it like a stroke and gave her asprin in the ambulance because that was what it looked like to me in the moment and also what I said to the operator and paramedics. We got to the hospital and they put me in the waiting room until they deemed her ready for me to see her. 
I was calling everyone, hyperventilating, acting absolutely hysterical in the ER bathroom thinking these were my last moments with my mom. 
I finally got to see her maybe an hour later and she was almost completely back to normal. 
Her speech was fine aside from being a little slower than usual, gait was normal, and was still repeating some questions but was mostly alright. They did a CT scan and even though nothing came up abnormal, they admitted her for 2 days for further testing. They did an MRI, ECG and hooked her up to a 24 hour EKG. Everything came up normal and nothing else ended up happening. The doctors are still baffled as to what happened and can’t decide between a TIA or a seizure. They ruled out a major stroke. She was discharged today and remembers everything. Can seizures present this way? Hers never have but it could always be a first. She said there was no aura like there was with her tonic clonic and no warning aside from the headache, double vision, and dizziness. She had a seizure last summer that presented as complete confusion and odd behaviors that lasted a few days but it was completely different from this. Paramedics couldn’t take her and the hospital wouldn’t admit her so that episode was never documented.

1gh0uc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1gh0uc1/prince_of_darknesspt1/,Prince of Darkness(Pt1),"Nicholas Shipman had always been good with people. In his FBI work, he could spot a lie before a suspect even spoke it, read a room with just a glance. It made him sharp, but not dangerous—or at least, not until *that day*. The day he walked through that door, the one he shouldn’t have entered, and saw… whatever it was he saw.

Afterward, the world felt strange. He’d stare a little too long at faces, noticing things he shouldn’t. It began with simple things: knowing a colleague’s mood without them saying a word, sensing how strangers would react before they even moved. His instincts had always been strong, but now they were precise, almost mechanical. His thoughts raced, faster than he could keep up.

A few days after *the room*, Nicholas found himself walking down the hall at work, passing by his coworkers. It was supposed to be another Monday, another briefing, but as he moved through the crowd, something changed. The air grew thick, like static. He felt *their* thoughts—little fragments, unspoken judgments, secret fears, everything they were trying to keep hidden.

There was Bill from Human Resources, with his forced grin and careful posture. Nicholas didn’t need more than a glance to know Bill had been skimming from the department budget for months, siphoning off bonuses to cover his gambling habit. Then there was Alice, his own partner, eyes red-rimmed from crying in the bathroom again, but not from grief. No, the tears were a mask, hiding her rage—at him, at the promotion he’d taken without knowing she wanted it.

With each person he passed, the layers peeled back. It was as if they were broadcasting straight to him, showing him the rotten cores they’d hidden so well. *He didn’t even have to look*. He just *knew*.

A wave of nausea hit him. Nicholas stumbled, gripping the wall, trying to block it all out. But the details kept pouring in. Names, addresses, secrets, regrets. He could see their lives laid out like open books, the information flooding him, too fast to control.

Later that day, Nicholas sat in the break room, staring blankly at the table. His hands shook as he sipped his coffee, ignoring the low chatter around him. He wasn’t sure how much more he could take. His mind felt like a cracked dam, straining against the flood of thoughts and knowledge that didn’t belong to him. Every person who walked by sent a new wave crashing through him, each one more nauseating than the last.

Across the table, Agent Lacey slid into the seat, concern etched on her face. “Hey, Nick. You okay? You’ve been… off lately.”

He forced a smile, but his voice came out strained. “Oh, you know. Just the usual Monday blues.”

Lacey frowned. “If it’s something more, you know you can talk to me, right?”

Nicholas almost laughed. *Talk to her?* He didn’t need to. He already knew everything she’d say. Knew about her husband, knew about the late nights spent staring at a silent phone, knew that she wore her sadness like a cloak, hoping no one would see it. And worse—he knew she despised him for how easy things seemed for him. How she thought he was the golden boy, clueless to the struggles she faced. Nicholas knew every bitter thought she’d ever had about him.

But he couldn’t tell her any of this. So instead, he just nodded. “I appreciate it, really.”

Lacey reached out, placing a hand on his. He felt the gesture for what it was—an obligation, not genuine warmth. She pitied him. Saw him as broken, maybe even weak. And that was the worst part—now, he saw her too clearly to ignore it.

The weight grew heavier by the day. He knew his colleagues were starting to notice; they whispered about him behind closed doors, threw worried glances his way. But he couldn’t help it. The constant flood of details, secrets, weaknesses—it was like he was drowning in them. He couldn’t shut it off, couldn’t stop seeing through their masks.

One night, after an exhausting day, he found himself in his supervisor’s office. Agent Carlson sat across from him, brows knitted in concern.

“Nick,” Carlson said softly, “you’ve changed. Everyone sees it. They’re worried, and frankly, so am I.”

Nicholas forced a laugh, but it sounded hollow, even to him. “Worried about me? Come on, I’m fine. I’m just… seeing things more clearly, that’s all.”

Carlson’s expression hardened. “Look, you’re not the first agent to struggle after a tough case. We’re all here to help you, but you have to be honest with us. Tell me—what’s really going on?”

The words stuck in Nicholas’s throat. He wanted to tell him, wanted to explain the constant stream of knowledge he couldn’t turn off, the way he was seeing things that didn’t make sense. But he knew Carlson wouldn’t understand. None of them would.

Instead, he gave a half-hearted shrug. “Maybe I just need some sleep.”

But Carlson didn’t buy it. He leaned in, a hint of pity in his eyes. “We’re assigning you a therapist, Nicholas. Just someone to talk to, alright? They’ll help you make sense of… whatever’s going on.”

Nicholas felt a pang of frustration but forced himself to stay calm. “A therapist. Right. Like talking about it’s gonna change anything.” He gave a bitter laugh, glancing away. “Sometimes, there’s no point in fighting it. Sometimes, you just have to go along for the ride, you know?”

# Dr. Lewis, the assigned therapist, was a calm woman with soft eyes and a steady hand that never wavered as she jotted down notes. Nicholas sat across from her, his usual charm dulled by exhaustion. He was worn thin, haunted by the faces he couldn’t stop analyzing, the voices he couldn’t silence.

Nicholas sat across from Dr. Lewis, his expression unreadable as he watched her scribble something down on a notepad. The office was quiet, lit by the soft glow of a single desk lamp that cast her face in half-shadow. She looked up, meeting his eyes with a practiced smile.

“Nicholas,” she began, her tone calm and steady, “I understand things have been… difficult lately. Why don’t you tell me what’s on your mind?”

He stared at her, the corner of his mouth twitching as if he was on the edge of a laugh. “What’s on my mind?” he repeated, as though she’d just told a joke he couldn’t help but find amusing. “You wouldn’t believe me, Doc. And even if you did, it wouldn’t matter. What I’m seeing… what I know… It’s not something you can just ‘talk’ about.”

Dr. Lewis jotted down a few more notes, her face composed. “Try me. I think you’ll find I’m here to listen.”

He looked away, his eyes narrowing as if he were focusing on something far beyond the walls of the room. “Do you ever wonder what people look like without their masks, Dr. Lewis?”

She paused, pen hovering over the paper. “Without… their masks?”

Nicholas leaned forward, his voice soft, almost conspiratorial. “The parts they hide. The parts they’d rather pretend don’t exist. The lies, the secrets, the faces they only show in the dark.” His gaze drifted to her, and his smile returned, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “I can see it all now. Every mask, every shield, stripped away. You should try it sometime, Doc. It’s quite the education.”

Dr. Lewis held his gaze, unmoved. “It sounds like you’ve been feeling overwhelmed. Seeing too much. That can be exhausting, especially if you feel like you can’t escape it.”

He let out a low laugh, shaking his head. “Oh, Doc. That’s the thing. I don’t want to escape it.” He leaned back, his fingers tapping rhythmically on the armrest. “See, once you’ve seen what I’ve seen, there’s no ‘before and after.’ There’s just a line—a point where you cross over, and the person you were just… fades away.” He tilted his head, eyes glinting with a strange light. “Tell me, Doc, do you know what that’s like?”

Dr. Lewis shifted in her seat, her eyes steady. “Why don’t you tell me what it feels like?”

Nicholas chuckled, a low, humorless sound. “You don’t want to know. I mean, it’s one thing to have people lie to you. It’s another to see the lie right there, staring you in the face.” He leaned in, his smile widening. “Like you, Doc. Sitting there with that kind, reassuring expression, thinking I don’t know what’s going on in your head.”

She blinked, breaking her professional calm for just a moment. “And what is going on in my head, Nicholas?”

His eyes gleamed with amusement as he leaned even closer. “Fear. Pity. You think I’m broken, don’t you? Another fragile mind, just cracked enough that you can put me into a nice, neat little box. But you’re wrong.” His voice dropped to a whisper. “It’s not me that’s cracked, Doc. It’s the world. And I’m the only one who’s finally seeing it for what it is.”

Dr. Lewis stayed silent, pen poised, watching him carefully.

Nicholas sighed, almost mockingly. “You know, for someone who’s supposed to understand people, you really don’t get it, do you? People wear their masks so tightly, they forget they’re even wearing them. They live in these safe little bubbles, hiding all the filth and rot beneath.” He chuckled, shaking his head. “But I see it now. I see the rot… and I’m going to fix it.”

Her eyes flickered with a hint of concern. “Fix it?”

He grinned, his eyes glinting with dark excitement. “Imagine a world where no one hides. Where every mask is stripped away, and people are forced to confront who they really are. No secrets, no lies.” He leaned back, crossing his arms. “Utopia.”

Dr. Lewis swallowed, visibly tensing. “And you think you can make that happen?”

He laughed, genuinely this time, the sound filling the small office. “Oh, Doc, I’m counting on it.” He looked at her, his gaze piercing, unwavering. “Starting with you.”

Dr. Lewis’s pen stopped moving. Her face paled as she realized what he meant, but before she could react, Nicholas was on his feet, moving faster than she could process. In an instant, he was beside her, leaning close enough that she could feel his breath on her cheek.

“Sometimes, Doc,” he whispered, “you don’t get to ask the questions. Sometimes, you’re the one who gets *answered*.”

The last thing Dr. Lewis saw was his cold, amused smile, a perfect mask of its own, as he showed her exactly what lay beneath.

so back then I was together with my then bf lets call him Andy, 

My friend, lets call her Barb, met him when he was picking me up from class, 

she and I met, because we took the same class together, looking back I guess I did see some red flags on her behavior, she was always together in class with this one guy, to whom she seemed very closed, they would have inner jokes, and be a bit touchy feely, later on I found out he was married, and she was just his friend, but it really seemed a bit inappropriate for just a friendship, but I didn't put any thought into that back then, 

her and I became good friends, and started going out after class for dinner, shopping, cafe outings etc, 

when she met my then bf, she made a comment that he was really good looking, and immediately started a conversation with him, from which I felt a bit excluded, but still nothing major, 

I knew she had a boyfriend, and I thought well, maybe its just her bubbly personality, I am much more of an introvert, 

We did went on a few double dates, and it became apparent that my bf and her were the more extrovert of the group, while her bf and I were much quieter, and we would also drink less than them, 

her bf shared the story of how they met, and it seemed cute, later on she shared with me that she wanted him to propose and she wanted a family with him, so it was clear that they were not just a casual relationship. 

they had been together for a while already, and she would often complaint that he had not ask her to marry him yet, 

My then bf had proposed to me and we were quite serious about our relationship, but sometimes he would drink too much and be a bit inappropriate in general, to the point that I had to order a taxi and get him home while he was almost blacked out. 

I was very concern with his alcohol habits, since he would drink every day, and sometimes it would be so much that others would be very annoyed with his behavior, which was beyond just been drunk. 

I shared with her my concerns, and how I had ask him to please cut a bit back from the drinking and get a grip of himself when we were out. 

She agreed with me that he drank too much, 

one day I was supposed to meet with her for coffee, and she was more than an hour late, and when she showed up she was acting very strange, and seemed flustered, and did not really gave me an explanation, 

that was like a bit weird but not enough to suspect anything bad was going on, 

the week after that, I invited her to my place for dinner, 

Andy was very late from work, and wouldn't answer his phone, I tried calling her, also no answer, later on they both arrived at the same time, and both seemed sweaty and flustered, 

this was very weird or coincidental, but I had a bad feeling in my stomach, I proceeded to serve dinner and they insisted on drinking wine, I looked at her as to see if she understood that I wanted him to drink less, yet they started drinking like camels, I pick up the dinner plates and went to put them on the dish washer, when I overheard her say in a whisper, ""you cannot leave me drinking alone like the last time"". I continue doing the dishes to see what they would say he made a comment I couldn't hear, but I was already very uncomfortable. 

it seemed apparent that they have met behind my back, but I am very good at pretending I am ok when I am not, so I just went back to the table and sat down and continue to chat with them as if nothing was wrong, 

at one point I saw her foot going for his foot under the table, and she kept smiling at him, I stood up and pretended I had to do something in the living room, I was on the verge of tears, but was trying my best not to show it, I kept hearing them laugh and have a good time, until I had enough, and went and told her that it was quite late and we had to wake up early the next morning, she complaint and said they were having fun, I insisted in the most polite way I could, I even hugged her good bye and she left, 

I was speechless, I didn't know what to think or how to even address my concerns to Andy, but I was also annoyed with his behavior, 

I iced her for a few days, until she asked me to come have dinner at her place, and she really expressed how much our friendship meant to her, so I agreed and went to her place, 

everything seemed great, we had sushi and talked, and were having a good time, then her bf arrived, she made a comment on how she wasn't expecting him to come home so early, 

he came to the living room to greet us, he greeted her with a kiss and came to greet me with a hug, 

she jumped up from her sit and seemed very annoyed, she made a comment on how he would take any opportunity to hug a pretty girl and was clearly jealous and annoyed that he came close to me to say hi, 

  
I was shocked because this seemed like a big over reaction to a friendly greet, and given the way she treated my boyfriend and how touchy she was this seemed very hypocritical, 

after that it was apparent that she was not comfortable when he would even speak to me and seemed overly jealous, 

I remember thinking this was so ironic, it was like she was expecting me to do the things she do around my boyfriend and seemed worried that the same thing would happen to her... 

I said goodbye to both and left, again I felt really sad that this would be the way she would treat me, 

I had done nothing to be considered a thread, I am very respectful of my friends boyfriends and how I act around them, I would never be flirty or inappropriate with them because I care about my friendships and about their feelings. but I did not feel like she cared at all about my feelings or what she had done to my relationship. 



after that I didn't feel like hanging out with her, and I did not know how to tell her why, this was my bad, because I feel now, that I should have handle things with more maturity, but back then, my only defense mechanism was to ghost her, I did not answer her calls, I got changed to a different class, I never answered her texts and just pretended like she did not exist, 

which I know probably hurt her, 

a mutual friend of ours, asked me what had happened between us, since she was friends with both Barb and me, 

I just told her that I felt like she did not respect my boundaries, and I couldn't be comfortable meeting her more. 

she did not ask further details, and I never talked to Barb again. 

After a while I also ended up breaking up with Andy, mainly because of his drinking problem that was just getting worse by the day, and he refused to get help or even try to cut back, but that is a whole different story,

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded exploration. As I embarked on this freewriting journey, the repetition of the existential inquiry became the rhythm of my introspection.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

As the story unfolded, I traced the journey of the dove's symbolism, following its subtle influence on characters and events. The once quaint town underwent a transformative metamorphosis, and the symbolism of the dove became a thread that wove through the narrative, connecting disparate lives in unexpected ways.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

""Never, never, never give up."" The words echoed in my mind, a relentless epizeuxis that fueled the protagonist's journey against insurmountable odds. In the dystopian world I crafted, where hope was a rare commodity, the power of repetition became a beacon of resilience.

For a thousand words, I immersed myself in the protagonist's struggle, exploring the emotional depth of the epizeuxis as a mantra against despair. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry, a whispered promise that carried the weight of a shattered world on its shoulders.

As the narrative unfolded, the epizeuxis became a driving force, propelling the protagonist through a landscape of desolation and uncertainty. The repetition served as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the strength to persist often lies in the relentless echo of one's own determination.

**Response to Prompt 3: Hyperbole**

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers. ""This is it, the end of our mundane lives!"" proclaimed Mrs. Thompson, the town's eternal pessimist, as she clutched her cat, Captain Whiskers, with an air of impending catastrophe.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed—a pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden. The juxtaposition of these contrasting elements created a visual paradox that fascinated both residents and visitors alike.

As the narrative unfolded, the stark contrast between the city's cutting-edge architecture and the serene beauty of the Zen Garden became a metaphor for the characters' internal conflicts.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven. The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

In the political arena of Capital City, where decisions echoed through the corridors of power, a single phrase dominated conversations—the ""Iron Throne Statement."" This metonymic expression encapsulated not just a policy decision but the entire narrative of political maneuvering that unfolded within the city's hallowed halls.

The story unfolded with the metonymy acting as a symbolic gateway into the complexities of governance. The Iron Throne Statement, while seemingly straightforward, carried the weight of a thousand debates, negotiations, and betrayals.

The story immersed itself in the world of clichés, where the seemingly predictable phrases became living entities with the power to alter reality. As characters grappled with the clichés that defined their lives, they discovered that beneath the familiarity lay profound truths and unexpected consequences.

Through the lens of cliché, I explored the characters' journey to navigate the clichéd landscapes of their existence.

In the dystopian city of Emberfall, where the remnants of a fallen civilization lay entwined with the shadows of despair, a lone figure emerged—a rebel determined to dismantle the oppressive regime.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1730449821.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

It can be like reinforcement learning where you learn what makes your partner happy and adjust to get the best possible outcome.

Also relationship is just like you building a model for that specific person in your brain, where it knows about the dos and donts in the relationship. It’s basically overfitting when you are in a long relationship, which happens in supervised learning. Your model only knows the prediction on what will happen to that specific person if we do some things, as simple as getting your significant other a coffee at the morning without your partner asking and he/she will be very happy. But again this model will not work with other people (Person B might not like coffee) since its build for a specific person (Current partner).

So if you really love your partner, keep developing your model and don’t throw it away. Love never fails, if it fails then it was never love :)
