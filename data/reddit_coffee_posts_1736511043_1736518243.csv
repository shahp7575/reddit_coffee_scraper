What Are SEO Keywords?

Let‚Äôs start with the basics: search engine marketing keywords are unique phrases or phrases that human beings type into search engines like google and yahoo to find data. These words help search engines like google and yahoo recognize your content material and suit it to users' queries.

|Keyword Type|Example|Purpose|

|Branded keywords|""Starbucks menu""|Specific to a brand|

A little background about me: I have had 3 ghost encounters in my life. 2 of them were largely positive(a late family member and a late friend). My other1 was incredibly anxiety inducing and lasted much longer than the other 2. I'm not going to get into the details of that encounter to extensively as to not invite that energy back into my life(unless you think it could be relevant to my situation last night, lmk).

My friend, who is a well developed, lifelong medium seems to believe I am one too based on my experiences but I have never done any formal development. Spirits have talked to me both in real life and in dreams and I can see them in both as well.

Something happened at work last night that has me in shambles. I work the closing shift at a coffee shop and needless to say, it's pretty slow. I had sent my other coworkers on a break for the entirely of this situation so I was alone. About a half hour before close, a man came into the cafe. The hair all over my body stood up immediately and I almost puked. I've never had that physical of a reaction to anything before. I originally thought it was my intuition and maybe he was going to rob the place. However, I was wrong. He was perfectly pleasant when I took his order but spoke in a way that felt unnatural and almost robotic. He ordered his drink and then went to the restroom(which have no exterior doors or windows). 

9 o'clock rolls around and we are closed but he has not come out of the bathroom. My coworker does bathroom checks and she says that they are empty. It would've been impossible for the man to leave without me seeing him because I was in the cafe facing the only exterior door. Additionally, his drink was still on the counter. 

At this point my stomach drops and I have to go to the bathroom and puke. My hair is still standing up and I have a feeling of doom and dread I have never felt before. Last night, I dreamt of him exclusively. In the dreams, he simply spoke words I could not understand to me while facing away from me in a dim lit room. It almost reminded me of an interrogation room. 

I am still having pretty severe anxiety this morning and can't get this man's face out of my brain. What do you think it could have been? Am I just being paranoid? How do I stop thinking of him so much? ",1,1736516098.0,Mediums,3,1.0,False
1hy4ifw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hy4ifw,Trip report: A brief getaway in Italy: Florence to Rome,"Hi everyone.
Please imagine it‚Äôs an open mic night. Even though I am very shy, I‚Äôve conquered my stage fright and am now nervously speaking into the microphone, with you being my audience. Because even though it might seem easy, sharing these thoughts took a lot of courage for me.

Last year was rough. I struggled a lot with long COVID and was off the bike for four months. This trip, though short, felt like reclaiming a part of myself. I kept a journal during the ride, and I want to share a brief summary of those thoughts. You might like it, or you might not‚Äîbut I hope you‚Äôll bear with me and be gentle.

My wife and I set off to Italy for a short bikepacking adventure, or credit card touring, as some might call it, riding from Florence to Rome. Neither of us had ever been to Rome, though it had long been on my wife‚Äôs list of places to visit. She has a deep love and fascination for Italy, one that goes beyond the expected. Yes, she adores the food, but it‚Äôs not just about the taste. She loves sitting at a restaurant and ordering her meal in Italian, seeing the genuine delight on the waiter‚Äôs face as she tries to speak their language. She loves the coffee bars. Not just the coffee itself, but the moments spent sitting outside in the sun, watching the steam swirl into the cool morning air, surrounded by the melodies of Italian conversations. She‚Äôs captivated by the beauty of simple interactions, the charm of connection. Even our vegan diet isn‚Äôt sacred here; we make exceptions for dolci, for the taste but also for the joy of the experience. Above all, though, she loves cycling. And so do I.

Before diving a bit into our trip, I should mention that life in Austria, as an expat, can be both challenging and rewarding. The opportunity to cycle into Italy, Slovenia, or Hungary within a single day is a privilege I don‚Äôt take lightly. Yet, over time, the thrill has, I would say, dulled. Each return to Slovenia‚Äôs breathtaking landscapes or some of Hungary‚Äôs surprisingly well kept bike paths feels more like an excuse to avoid venturing further into the unknown. It‚Äôs Italy, again. Slovenia, again. Austria, again. A sense of sameness has set in, and I‚Äôll admit, it‚Äôs been hard on me.

For as long as I can remember, I‚Äôve wanted to travel to faraway places. I‚Äôve wanted to immerse myself in unfamiliar cultures, to hear languages I couldn‚Äôt understand, to experience the unknown. And once I was old enough, that‚Äôs exactly what I did. I climbed aboard planes and let them carry me over oceans, mountain ranges, and deserts. I loved the moment of stepping off a plane onto a remote tarmac‚Äîthe dew clinging to the fuselage, the hum of the airport vehicles, the scent of kerosene in the fresh air of a place I‚Äôve yet to know.

However, what started to strike me in those moments is the thought of everything I‚Äôve just traversed: the countless towns, rivers, and landscapes I barely noticed as I soared above them ‚Äì a detachment that disappears when cycling. 

When we stepped off the train in Florence and pedalled out of the city, I, again, felt the sense of traversing, but differently. Each bump in the road, each shift in traffic, became part of the story. We felt the warmth of the sun on open stretches and the chill of shaded paths. And thus, every detail came alive: the scent of the earth, the changing colours of the countryside, the exhaustion from a small climb after months of battling sickness.

We set off on a pre-planned route, weaving together sections of EuroVelo 5, quiet country roads, and the Via Francigena. We took our time, never covering more than 90 kilometres a day and peaking at 1,600 metres of elevation on our third day. The journey was a patchwork of contrasts‚Äîof laughter and exhaustion, icy mornings and golden afternoons.
We dodged the tourist crowds, only to swim through a sea of tourists in Siena. We found the locals‚Äô trattorias, we spent a fortune for subpar meals in restaurants near the sights. We cursed steep climbs, then marvelled at the views they rewarded us with. Radicofani tested our resilience, leaving us shivering while we waited for our host, only to find the apartment equally unheated. We waved at farmers and exchanged Salve‚Äôd pilgrims along the way. We enjoyed the daily warm shower and the comfort of real beds. On New Year‚Äôs Eve, we watched fireworks through a small window in the roof of our accommodation and kissed each other a happy new year.

We followed the Tiber River into Rome. We cycled to the Colosseum, stood in its shadow, and marvelled at the ancient glory of this city. Rome welcomed us with its sprawling beauty, and once again, Italy captured our hearts. My wife‚Äôs heart purely by being what it is, and my own, by the joy of seeing her the smile as we coasted through siesta-deserted towns. The quiet streets echoed with the ticking of our free hubs slicing through the stillness.¬† For all my feelings of familiarity‚Äîof ‚Äújust Italy‚Äù‚Äîit is never just Italy. There is always more to discover, more to feel.

In cycling, there is no distant hum of a jet engine, no maps on the back of the seat in front of you. Instead, there‚Äôs the road, or maybe there isn‚Äôt, but there is always journey itself. Florence to Rome may be a familiar line on a map, and yet again, it was a story of connection and rediscovery, one pedal stroke at a time.

If you‚Äôre interested in the hard facts such as: our setups, bikes, route details, or how to get your bike to Florence, feel free to ask away :)

1hy4cit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1hy4cit/the_crazy_dating_scene_im_in_right_now_this_is_my/,The crazy dating scene I'm in right now. This is my story.,"Hi I'm 32 F, recently left an abusive long marriage of almost a decade that I should have left years ago. Since I'm still in my early 30's I went straight into dating app to see my chance. And it's been crazy. I just wanted to share my story.

I get between 300-500 likes in a day. I have to hide my profile after it hits 400-500 since it becomes like a job application. I think I'm quite attractive and in the (European) country I am in right now, I'm considered an exotic beauty. I get the Pocahontas compliments a lot. I've gone out with 5 guys so far (within less than 2 weeks), and this is what has happened so far.

Since I'm considered a tourist here, I'm an easy target of guys who just want ONS/hook ups. NOT something I was really looking for, but hey I was stuck in an abusive relationship before, and I wanted to feel affection. I guess this is some kind of trauma response.

First guy, a business owner just my age, went straight into chasing me to meet same night. ""If we don't meet now, we won't ever meet"". Okay I was free so I met him quickly for a drink, and I liked him. We talked for over an hour and he had to go. Next day I asked if he wanted to do something, he invited me to his place. I said OK. That was the first time in my life saying yes to coming to a guy's place I barely knew. We ate, we watched, then we cuddled and kissed and had sex twice. He was very gentle, sweet, he complimented me, listened to me, etc. I left, and couldn't stop thinking about him ever since, which kind of made me even more depressed (on top of my own break up). During this time I felt like ""wow there's nice guys out there, I deserve so much better than the treatment from my ex"". He said later on this isn't going anywhere (since the distance) but I think he spends too much time at work and doesn't do anything fun. So I decided to move on (took me few weeks).

Second guy, claimed himself as a pilot and worked in finance, and that he had 2 passports - one American and one from a South American country. Immediately didn't buy his story. I know what Americans sound like. Been there twice, grew up watching American TV show. He wanted to meet at a coffee shop. SHOWED UP LATE, didn't buy anything, I went to get myself my own coffee. Left as soon as I could.

Third guy, a business owner. Didn't see much from his profile. Got a match since I liked his tattoos. He started with ""lets come to my place have some wine"" I said lets meet outside. He picked me up, planned where to go, we had lunch, drove to his place. We were chilling and he attacked me out of nowhere (must have gotten so horny), I consented to it. We had sex. He said lets meet again tomorrow. And he ghosted me. I have a lot in common with this guy. Can't stop thinking about this one too. Bit butthurt when he ""ghosted"" me. More on this story later at chapter 5.

Forth guy, a typical office worker. I asked him out the same day (traveling alone, I have a lot of time free and I get bored, don't want to waste time). He didn't pick me up, I took uber. We went to drink. Well he didn't buy me any drink. So we don't have much in common but he's good looking and tall. Drove to his place. Drank some more. Didn't have sex. Went home. I took uber back (he couldn't drive after drinking, and I'm OK with uber). Said he wanted to meet again, but probably changed his mind. Moved on pretty quickly.

Fifth guy, from working class. I asked him out also same night. We exchanged instagram accounts and my God. He's friends with guy number 3. And once I secured a date, guy number 3 texted me, he was really sick, thus didn't reply to my text. He wants to meet again. I'm so excited. But I was going to have a date with guy number 5. He picked me up and we went to get drinks at a place owned by a friend of guy number 3&5. So yeah they have mutual friends even. Guy number 5 commented my IG story that it's a nice place where I went to. I felt bad since he didn't know I was with his friend. After few drinks I started to like this guy a bit more. I was horny I agreed to come to his place and the rest is history. It was good to relieve this sexual tension a bit. I'm freaked out a bit knowing he's friends with guy number 3 which I liked the most so far (because of these things we have in common). Guy number 5 is nice, kind, sweet, and gentle. What a small world. I didn't intend to sleep with this guy considering I wanted to meet guy number 3 again but I thought he ghosted me and it just happened.

Honestly right now I'm feeling like a slut. I never thought in my life time I'd be doing something like this. Although I also feel like I am given second chance and life has begun again. I have another date with guy number 6 today. I really don't want to sleep with another guy anymore. I get mixed up who said what and what I've said to who. In summary I feel the dating scene is crazy. It's hard to find someone to commit to (and they probably think same as me anyway). I would like to get married again one day and I don't want to just have sex with different people for fun, but it's happening. Well no rush for me but I can't keep on going to dates for too long.

Ok. Im making good progress - but all interventions seem to work great for about a week, then plateau.

I was having pvcs that were provoked out of nowhere 3 mo ago today after a long day of splitting wood and lifting heavy wood blocks.

My assumption is this upset or worsened either a hiatal hernia or some cervical spine issue.

Worst periods have followed eating greasy foods - suggesting gastro connection.

But similarly, I get clusters with certain movements, suggesting vagal pinching or something.

Uniquely, I have split over 1000 cord of wood with no issues, then slowed down after a hand surgery in March and just got back to it. Day 1 triggered these PVCs.

Improvements seen with intermittent fasting and smaller meals, less coffee/tea, yin yoga, digestive enzymes

No difference: increased electrolytes 

Maybe a difference: taurine, berberine, multivitamin 

What gets me though is that if I am with my GF, no matter what I'm doing, I don't have skipped beats. If I did the same stuff I'd have them alone.

So I‚Äôm no coffee geek but I previously had Delonghi La Specialista Prestigio and never had crema issues. I‚Äôve since moved countries, moving soon again so bought a used Delonghi Stilosa just to tie me over until I move permanently and can invest again. 

I use same beans as I did with Prestigio. The water here has a lot of calcium but I filter it with Brita beforehand which seems to do a good job. Descaled very recently. Clean the portafilter every time.

Not sure if there‚Äôs anything else I can do to fix the issue or should I just accept it‚Äôs a crappy machine? Pressurised portafilter perhaps?

Would appreciate anyone‚Äôs input. ",2,1736515336.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Ciao, dolcezza! (Hello, sweetness!)  Ready to embark on a delicious journey through the world of Italian desserts?  Forget the diet ‚Äì for a moment, at least ‚Äì and let's explore some of the most iconic and irresistible treats Italy has to offer.  From the creamy indulgence of tiramisu to the crispy crunch of cannoli, we've got a sweet adventure waiting for you.

**The Classics: Tiramisu and Cannoli**

Let's start with the superstars.  You can't talk about Italian desserts without mentioning these two:

* **Tiramisu:** This beloved dessert is a symphony of flavors and textures.  Layers of espresso-soaked ladyfingers (savoiardi biscuits) are generously layered with a creamy mixture of mascarpone cheese, eggs, sugar, and cocoa powder. The result? A heavenly, coffee-infused treat that's both rich and light, decadent yet refreshing.  It‚Äôs truly a classic for a reason!  Pro-tip: Look for versions made with high-quality mascarpone for the best flavor.

* **Cannoli:**  Imagine a crisp, fried pastry shell, filled with a luscious, sweet ricotta filling.  That's a cannoli!  These little tubes of delight are often studded with candied fruit and chocolate chips, adding a delightful textural contrast to the creamy interior.  The perfect balance of sweet, creamy, and crunchy makes them an irresistible indulgence.  Don't be shy ‚Äì grab a couple (or more!).

**Beyond the Big Names: Exploring Other Italian Sweets**

Italy's dessert scene is far more diverse than just tiramisu and cannoli.  Here are a few other treats to tantalize your taste buds:

* **Panna Cotta:**  This creamy, dreamy delight is essentially Italian panna cotta.  It's a silky smooth custard, often flavored with vanilla or fruit, that's set in individual molds.  It's light, delicate, and the perfect ending to a rich meal.

* **Gelato:**  Let's be honest, gelato deserves its own post (and maybe a whole trip to Italy!).  This artisanal ice cream is denser and richer than its American counterpart, with intense flavors and often unique ingredients.  From classic pistachio and hazelnut to adventurous stracciatella and lemon sorbet, the possibilities are endless.

* **Biscotti:**  These twice-baked cookies are delightfully crunchy and perfect for dipping in coffee or Vin Santo (a sweet dessert wine).  They come in a variety of flavors, from almond to anise, and are a great way to end a meal or enjoy with a mid-afternoon coffee.

* **Tartufo:** This isn't the mushroom, but a delicious frozen dessert with layers of chocolate, nuts, and sometimes ice cream. It‚Äôs similar to an ice cream cake but richer and usually features intensely flavored chocolate.

**Where to Find These Delights:**

You'll find these incredible desserts in countless pasticcerie (pastry shops) across Italy. Don't hesitate to ask for recommendations from locals ‚Äì they'll often point you towards hidden gems with the most authentic and delicious treats.  Many restaurants also offer a delightful selection of Italian desserts on their menus.

**Sweeten Your Italian Adventure:**

So there you have it ‚Äì a glimpse into the wonderful world of Italian desserts.  Whether you're planning a trip to Italy or just want to indulge in a little taste of ""la dolce vita"" at home, these sweet treats are sure to satisfy your cravings.  Buon appetito! (Enjoy your meal!)

The second I reply to one of his messages he reads it and starts replying immediately and I can't even read and reply to his earlier texts. And the conversation doesn't even flow naturally because he just keeps forcing (the second we stop talking he just starts spamming me with texts about a different topic, he even texted me a lot on Christmas) it so it's really putting me off to the point I don't even want to reply. He's also been changing plans we've made and he keeps asking ""Are you still ok with just getting coffee or do you want to do something else?""

My Detailed Experience,"Teeth whitening is something I‚Äôve always wanted to try but felt hesitant about. With so many products and methods out there, it‚Äôs hard to know what actually works. Professional whitening treatments are expensive, and many over-the-counter options seem underwhelming. So, I decided to try **Laughland teeth whitening** after reading positive reviews. Here‚Äôs a full breakdown of my experience and whether it‚Äôs worth trying.

# Why I Decided to Try Laughland Teeth Whitening

I drink coffee and tea regularly, and over time, my teeth started showing noticeable stains. I wanted a solution that was affordable, easy to use, and effective, but I also needed something gentle. My teeth tend to be sensitive, and I‚Äôve had bad experiences with whitening strips in the past. Laughland caught my attention because it‚Äôs an **at-home kit with dentist-formulated gel** and an **LED mouthpiece**‚Äîa combination that sounded more professional than most products.

# What‚Äôs Included in the Laughland Kit?

When I opened the Laughland teeth whitening kit, here‚Äôs what I found:

1. **Whitening Gel**: A clear gel that‚Äôs designed to remove both surface and deep stains.
2. **LED Mouthpiece**: A device that activates the gel, helping it work faster and more effectively.
3. **Applicator Pens**: For precise application of the gel to your teeth.
4. **Instructions**: A step-by-step guide that‚Äôs simple and easy to follow.

The packaging was compact and straightforward, and everything felt high-quality, which gave me confidence from the start.

# How the Whitening Process Works

Using the Laughland kit is simple and only takes 10 minutes a day:

1. **Brush Your Teeth**: Make sure your teeth are clean and dry before starting.
2. **Apply the Gel**: Use the applicator pen to evenly coat your teeth with the whitening gel.
3. **Insert the LED Mouthpiece**: Place the device in your mouth, turn it on, and let it work for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse**: Remove the mouthpiece, rinse your mouth, and clean the device for the next session.

The process is easy enough to do while watching TV or scrolling on your phone, which made it feel less like a chore.

# My Results: Day-by-Day Progress

Here‚Äôs what my experience looked like over the six-day whitening cycle:

* **Day 1**: After the first session, I didn‚Äôt see immediate results, but my teeth felt cleaner. The gel had no harsh taste, and the LED mouthpiece was comfortable to use.
* **Day 3**: By the third session, I noticed my teeth were starting to brighten. The stains from coffee and tea were fading, and my smile looked more vibrant.
* **Day 6**: By the end of the six-day cycle, my teeth were significantly whiter‚Äîabout 6‚Äì7 shades brighter. The results were natural-looking, and there was no uneven whitening or patchiness.

One of the best parts? **No sensitivity.** Unlike whitening strips that often left my teeth aching, Laughland was gentle yet effective.

# What Makes Laughland Different?

After using various whitening products in the past, here‚Äôs why I think Laughland stands out:

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel**: The gel is designed to be both effective and safe, targeting deep stains without damaging enamel.
2. **LED Technology**: The LED mouthpiece enhances the gel‚Äôs effectiveness, delivering faster and more even whitening.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Ingredients**: The gel is stored in controlled conditions to maintain its potency, unlike many over-the-counter options that degrade over time.

# How Does Laughland Compare to Other Whitening Methods?

Here‚Äôs how Laughland stacked up against other whitening methods I‚Äôve tried:

* **Whitening Strips**: Affordable but often cause uneven whitening and sensitivity.
* **Whitening Toothpaste**: Great for maintenance but not strong enough to remove deeper stains.
* **Professional Treatments**: Extremely effective but costly and time-consuming, with a higher risk of sensitivity.

Laughland feels like a happy medium. It offers professional-grade results at a fraction of the cost and without the discomfort of other methods.

# Common Questions About Laughland Teeth Whitening

Here are a few questions I had before starting, along with what I found:

1. **Will it damage my enamel?** Not at all. The gel is formulated to be safe for enamel while lifting stains.
2. **How long do results last?** This depends on your habits. Avoiding staining foods and drinks can help maintain results for several months.
3. **Is it worth the time?** Definitely. The daily sessions only take 10 minutes, and the results were noticeable within a few days.

# Tips for Success

If you‚Äôre planning to try Laughland, here are some tips to get the most out of it:

1. **Stick to the Routine**: Consistency is key. Use the kit daily for six days as recommended.
2. **Avoid Staining Foods**: Cut back on coffee, tea, and wine during the whitening process to prevent new stains.
3. **Practice Good Oral Hygiene**: Regular brushing and flossing will help preserve your results.

# Final Thoughts

At-home teeth whitening kits can be hit or miss, but Laughland delivered results that exceeded my expectations. It‚Äôs easy to use, gentle on sensitive teeth, and provided noticeable improvements in less than a week.

If you‚Äôre looking for a cost-effective and convenient way to brighten your smile, I‚Äôd definitely recommend giving Laughland a try.

1hy40rv,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hy40rv/66_days_caffeine_free/,66 Days caffeine free ,"Coming up to about 10 weeks caffeine free and just wanted to share my experience.

I used to feel like I needed caffeine first thing in the morning before I even think about doing anything else. I would be really grouchy if I couldn't immediately have my Bang or Reign - 300mg. I would drink it fast, I never understood people sipping them for an hour or more, mine was in my body as fast as I could get it. I would also have a few cups of coffee at about 4pm. Or some strong preworkout with caffeine so I would estimate my daily at about 500mg ish.

Years ago I tried quitting cold turkey and it was unbearable. Not just the cravings, but the mood, I was so miserable and tired. So I went back to it after trying to quit for 2 weeks. 

This time however, I tapered off. I took my time and gradually decreased, from 500, to 400 after a week, then another week and just strong coffee in the morning (250 ish) and one coffee at 4. Then I got it down to a 200mg caffeine pill in the morning only, did that for a few weeks, then half a caffeine pill in the morning for a few weeks. Then, a 50mg tea in the mornings for a few weeks, then 20mg green tea in the mornings for another week, and now I only drink caffeine free tea in the mornings as soon as I wake up and then herbal tea throughout the day. 

It was considerably easier to taper taking my time this way. Changing my habit was a bit out of my comfort zone, but I wasn't miserable and tired like before. I felt pretty ok, no headaches. Once I got down to zero mg, I did experience other things.

I now feel sleepy around 10pm and find it very easy to fall asleep at night. However, I did have some very predictable insomnia. Like clockwork I would wake up at 4am almost every morning, and find it hard to get back to sleep. This has only just started getting better, now I tend to wake up feeling alert at about 6am. I do however sleep through until this time, so I'm falling asleep around 11pm and waking up at 6am, feeling alert and refreshed. I'm happy with this.

I don't feel tired at 4pm anymore. My husband who still drinks caffeine will often nap in the afternoons then have a coffee. I just simply have no need to, my energy is good until 10pm ish. 

At zero mg, I began to experience a sense of almost clarity, or awakening. Feeling like I am more my true self, able to be my real self or think more or feel more like me. It's hard to explain, but I also experienced childhood memories flooding back to me, and I feel more in control. 

When I was waking up at 4am I would say I was feeling increased anxiety, like more anxious than I was when I was drinking caffeine, but now I would say I feel more in tune with myself. I still have some worries, but they don't feel like they're unmanageable like they did before.

It's difficult for me to say if my appetite changed, I've always had a big appetite, I workout a lot, and I enjoy my food a lot, that's seemed to have stayed the same. I did however find it slightly more challenging at the gym at first, but now I feel stronger and I feel I'm able to push harder (perhaps due to better recovery from better sleep) and I get a better pump after too (perhaps due to much better hydration).

So overall, I would say taper off and take your time tapering down. Be prepared for some insomnia and anxiety but that will subside with time. If you stick at it I think you'll feel better at the gym and get better results, be able to fall asleep easier and wake up feeling refereshed, and have more balanced energy throughout the day. You may even feel this sense of clarity or control over yourself that I feel too. Feeling in control is a nice feeling, I also think it has helped me to control my other habits too, I'm 27 days alcohol free and I find it easier to stick to a healthy, clean diet.

1hy40a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1hy40a8/pmo_problem/,PMO problem?,"Hello, It came time for me to actually aknowledge my issues and talk to fellow people asking for some advice do you think that PMO is my main problem currently or thats just part of the puzzle and hopefully and advice to how do i approach to this Im 27 years old(virgin) who is just coming off from 4 years approximately of taking anti-depressants(diagnosed with Anxiety Atacks when i was like 22 years old maybe) and now im in a process of stopping them completely(next month i will stop taking any.Keep in mind i never talked to my psychiathrist for my i think deepest problems and maybe i should have but the amount of shame and growing up not on the western side of Europe(which makes it even worse talking about this kind of topics) made me not wanting to talk about it.Also he was kind of an old guy so i dont think he was competent at all to actually give me¬†[advice.So](http://advice.so/)¬†growing up i always had friends and was engaging in different kind of sports i was a social kid up untill maybe 14 when its the time for you to switch school where i decided to be 'cool guy' , started smoking cigarettes weed and then like u can imagine i started taking other harder substances as well(i never tried the extremes like heroin and stuff)cause i was out alot out with my friends partying but i always had problems making connections with girls, i had really low self esteem due to being tall and very skinny and being 'bullied' for that by the 'bad boys' in the neigbhbourhood so even tho i had a lot of girls actually making the first step towards me showing me they are intersted in me i either ran away or ignored them because of my own problems with my self esteem and thinking they're out of my league even though they are the ones who actually made the first step towards me(this sounds kind of stupid when i look back but thats the truth).There were some girls that i really liked and made the first step towards but for some reason they never seemed intrested in me that much so it never kind of worked¬†[out.So](http://out.so/)¬†i ended up having some interractions with girls like kissing etc. but it never got to sex.I wanna add here that i started watching porn since maybe 13 so that migth've caused my gf issues as well,anyways it wasnt a big deal for me back then.After that i graduated school worked a bit and then went abroad with a plan to be for a couple of months only to save some money but it ended up being 6 years there and i think thats where most of my big problems¬†[started.So](http://started.so/)¬†i was 19 when i moved to the other country it was an english speaking one so i had no problems with the language started working a lot i was really motivated but still single so i was getting more into porn and never really seriously thought that i actually need someone i felt that this was enough for me.2 Years went by with me working extreme hours,made some money and i went back home for 2 weeks then my grandma died which was like a second mother to me so i took it really bad but i had to go back to my work anyways so thats what i did after my vacation ended.Then i started working again and after a holiday i came back and something started to¬†[happen.So](http://happen.so/)¬†i was still alone with no girlfriend(i had friends there though so i was not completely alone) and i was getting more and more into porn and masturbation and because of the previous events and this amount of work that i was doing i start getting depressed doing it more and more(sometimes 4 times mostly night time i never masturbated in a public place or something).One time i ejacualted and after that i started feeling something like a panic atack(sweating,my mouth was dry,chest pain,extremly worried felt like i was dying) so i went to the emergency center where they checked me and said that theres nothing wrong with me and this is probably anxiety/panic¬†[atack.So](http://atack.so/)¬†i started to read a lot bout porn and masturbation in general because i felt like this was the reason for this atacks and i saw the NOFAP movement so i tried it for a month and it was succesful.I did not masturbate or watched porn for a month so i was like okay i can do it so im not addicted and then without even realising it i started doing it again and sometimes i had the same symptoms after ejaculating but what was different is that these 'panic/anxiety atack' symtoms started even without watching porn and masturbating which lead to that for me to go see a¬†[psychiatrist.So](http://psychiatrist.so/)¬†i went back home ,talked to the guy, and he prescribed me Serotonin and Fluanxol which i started to take and the first year i felt like i was on actual drugs i felt extremely good they actually helped a lot with my mood and the attacks stopped as well.The covid restrictions started to get loose and we were able to go to coffees and stuff so i was going out with couple of girls on a date but nothing really worked out again because they were just not really that into¬†[me.So](http://me.so/)¬†i was spending covid days back at home and then when covid restrictions were lifted i went back to work.And everything started again because i had no actual social interractions i spend my last 2 2 and ahalf years working and in my free time playing video games and watching porn with masturbating(i wanna note that i was never watching porn extended amount of times just to do my 'job' and then i carry on with other stuff).And a year ago i decided to go back home because my other grandma died and after a month my dad as well while my mom was alone here having to deal with that by herself(me and my mom are the only ones alive from our family now).Keep in mind that i've never been close with my dad he was extreme alcoholic all of his life which i didnt touch on but u can guess whats an alcoholic is like,hes never been abusive though. Also i wanted to actually stop these anti depressants because even tho i said they were helping me a lot at first,after that i started to go back to that 'depressed' state.Considering the fact that i dont workout and for this 6 years that i lived abroad all i did pretty much is work - go home video games/masturbate - work and occasionally went on some holidays this probablt added to my depressed condition as¬†[well.So](http://well.so/)¬†here i am 27 years old back in my country,almost a year here already 1 month for me left to completely stop the anti depressants which is a good thing i guess , however im kind of 'away from humanity' due to me not being in the town currently which will change when i have to find a job here in a couple of months.The problem is i am still into the PMO doing it every other day(i rarely do it more than one round) and i got to the point where i ejaculate in 2 minutes i guess every person who struggles with PMO struggles with this as well.I tried the last few weeks not to watch porn again and i can do it but i cant not masturbate more than 2days,I just go to sleep and my mind is into this horny mode thinking about sex and stuff i get aroused and i just have to masturbate before i go to sleep.I tried to do it without porn and just to some random chick pictures on my fb and it works but i think thats kind of a soft porn as well.Also big note here that i noticed since i stoped smoking cigarettes i am waaaay more horny to the point that i cant really fight it anymore,i cant fight with my mind,because of that i started to think if its a good idea to go back to smoking,or maybe i can just start heavy exercise co i can lower my sex drive a lil¬†[bit.Im](http://bit.im/)¬†really considering going to a prostitute for a couple of times just so i can get some 'training' from a professional,cause this 'virgin' thing not being sexually experienced i think fucks with me BY FAR the most and its goiing to affect my confidence(that i already struggle with) more than anything.Also with this 1minute ejaculation does that goes away once u start have actual sexual interactions?. I really dont know anymore how to approach the situation thats why im here asking for help or just advice.Its my first time talking about it thats why its so long cause i had all this in my head for years and now i finally wanna just find some help if its possible how do i go about this porn and masturbation situation and my situation in general cause i think this is in the root of my problems.I still have not gave up and i have hope that i can 'fix' myself sorry for this being so long im just really frustrated lately and i wanted to put this out there and if someone is in the same struggle or just have some advice in general i am more than ready to take it.Also if someone needs additional information in order to help me im happy to give it!Also English is my second language so i apologise if i have a lot mistakes thank you!",1,1736514469.0,NoFap,0,1.0,False
1hy3znt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1hy3znt/brand_new_to_nespresso_normally_love_really_good/,"Brand new to Nespresso, normally love really good espresso (with nothing added). Was skeptical at first, but am blown away by taste quality difference of ristretto vs espresso pull with my Pixie!","When I first got the Nespresso, I had no idea that you could program the machine or customize the size of the pours. I was planning to primarily use the espresso shots, and occasionally the Lungo. I exclusively drink black coffee and espresso, and do love the delicious taste of espresso pulled from a lovely coffee shop (and wasn't sure how close to that taste I could get with Nespresso).

&#x200B;

Lo and behold this week I get my first Nespresso Pixie from Costco, and start to tinker. I would say the taste of the espresso and Lungo pours has been solid, good, but not anywhere close to the caramel chocolate complexity of an espresso pulled from a fancy coffee shot. I was not disappointed, and was ready to make the best of it. Then I checked out this reddit and started seeing people recommend pulling ristretto, and I was skeptical at first, but oh my goodness the last few days I have experimented with it and it is a NIGHT AND DAY difference, I daresay even approaching the deliciousness of a fancy coffee shop espresso. 

I am currently doing it by tapping the button to stop the pour about half way through an espresso shot, but def will program one of my two buttons soon as a permanent ristretto option.

&#x200B;

I am curious to hear others thoughts and experiences with this (Especially folks who prefer black coffee and high quality delicious espresso without anything added), and any tips for making the most of my new Pixie.

My husband has had a severe episode of allergies and eczema recently so he got a appointment with a primary care doctor

Background: my husband has had severe allergies and asthma since he was a kid. He reacted to everything on his skin prick test as a teenager and always has to take clearitin or use his rescue inhaler. Over the past year he developed eczema and it got very severe, he had red sleeves and weeping and crusting. It spread all over his face and to all of his creases. We finally moved out of a house that had 3 large pet birds and he's progressively been getting a lot better.

He went to a primary care doctor for a referral to an allergist but they said they wanted to do tests first. They did a blood panel and a blood allergy panel. He came back at 100+ level 6 allergies to dust and animal dander, his IGE percentage was 12,400. Off the charts. We had been moved out of the house for about 4 weeks when his labs were taken. 

He has a follow up soon but the lab screwed up and listed him as female so his quest test results aren't as great as they looked at first. Besides his insane allergies and IGE the rest of his labs came back normal except I have some questions about these results 

4.76 RBC
 20%transferrin saturation
349 iron binding capacity 
103 ferritin 

Are these results normal? Some are on the very low end of normal and I'm worried about him. The lab website says everything is normal but is it?

","I currently own a 20-bar espresso machine, a model that‚Äôs only sold domestically in my country. To pair with it, I bought a white-label espresso grinder from AliExpress, a replica of the Jaffes J1 Pro.

Every coffee I make with this grinder turns out bad‚Äîalways very bitter, with a medicinal taste (Acidic, maybe?). I‚Äôve tried fresh roasts, medium roasts, and even beans with chocolate and caramel notes, but the results are always the same.

I decided to try a different and unusual test: I used pre-ground coffee that was suitable for a pressurized filter, and the coffee turned out okay. However, when I put the same coffee through the grinder to fine-tune it for an unpressurized (naked) filter, the result was bad again.

Hey everyone,

I just need to vent because I‚Äôm feeling really lost lately. I recently increased my dose of Mounjaro to 10mg, and it feels like everything that used to bring me joy has disappeared.

Coffee used to be my life‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt go a day without looking forward to my morning cup. Now, I don‚Äôt even like it anymore. The same goes for food. I can‚Äôt stomach anything, and nothing appeals to me anymore. I don‚Äôt look forward to meals, snacks, or even my favourite treats.

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I don‚Äôt even bother going to the shop because most of what I buy ends up going to waste. I‚Äôll look at the food in the fridge or cupboards and just feel sick at the thought of eating it, even if it‚Äôs something I used to love. I did a nice M&S shop the other night to maybe trick my brain into eating what I enjoy. But no, it‚Äôs still all just sitting in the fridge and cupboards staring at me. 

This isn‚Äôt just about food, though. It feels like a piece of my personality is missing. The little things that used to make life enjoyable don‚Äôt feel the same anymore. No cookie with my tea. No butter and bread. I thought this medication would help me feel better, but instead, I feel like I‚Äôve lost touch with the things that made me happy. I hate everything I look at. I‚Äôm surviving purely off herbal tea, water and bits of sliced turkey from the deli section. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do. Has anyone else experienced this? Will it pass, or do I need to make a change? Any advice or similar experiences would mean a lot right now.

We went out and grabbed a coffee. Our meeting lasted couple of hours. That went fine. After that we started hanging out pretty much every day. It was okay at first but as the time goes I realize I've spent all my free time with them. I work for most of the day and am up since 5, after that they ask me if I want to hang, I said sure but only for a short amount of time. This somehow spirals down into couple of hours of rambling and coffee drinking. When I get home I'm already too drained to do anything but I decide to spend some time working on some projects I've started. Last time we were hanging out I said I have to go and was met with a very agressive ""why"". I stated that I really don't have the time and they proceeded to get offended and were rolling their eyes. I want to spend some time with my family and working on my projects and recently I even started going to the gym. I don't know if I'll be able to keep up the pace with constant hang outs that last for hours on end. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy their company but it's absurd to me that they don't understand when I tell them that I need some alone time or that I don't want to hang that day. What gets me going the most is that they probe into why I'm not available. Yes, I can answer that, but why should I justify myself to them. Am I in the wrong here? Am I the asshole? Any tips?",4,1736512473.0,introvert,5,1.0,False

Yon led everyone out of the building and to the main part of Tulip square. She glanced up in the sky purposefully, and Nick heard the siren announcing a Hopper being called.

  


As the Hopper came down, Nick noticed the differences. Instead of the garish bright colors of a regular Hopper, this one was all black with subtle blue highlights. As it settled on the ground there was no fanfare, no automated voice and when the door opened, there was no odor of sandalwood. Nick breathed a sigh of relief at that. Yon stepped in and sat in the plush leather seat. ""Come on, we're leaving.""

  


The three of them stepped into the vehicle and the door closed silently behind them. Instead of the rough takeoff of the regular Hopper, this car lifted smoothly and silently into the air. It rose to around 300 meters over the ground, above most of the regular Hopper traffic and started zooming down arm, towards the base. They continued to soar down-arm and as they did the buildings nearer the base grew taller and taller until they reached the tall spire of Houndstooth One, the tallest building on Hyacinth.

  


When Hyacinth was spun for artificial gravity, tall buildings tended to not be as popular as in other locations throughout human space. While Hyacinth was very large and there's no worry that Houndstooth One would touch anywhere near the center and have the penthouse be in microgravity, a person on the upper floors would feel noticeably lighter, and people tended to get motion sick.

  


Now that Hyacinth has artificial gravity that isn‚Äôt an issue anymore. Houndstooth One was - as far as Hyacinth goes - a relatively new building; it was only a couple centuries old. As they stepped off the Hopper onto the roof of Houndstooth One, Nick, Eastern and Selkirk got a view of Hyacinth that few ever get to see.

  


Nick had to admit, it was a beautiful view. Back on Parvati he and his parents would take a day trip into the mountains and go on hikes. It would be a few hours of a hot, sweaty slog but at the end, they could look down over the city and the ocean and it felt like he could see forever. Eastern looked excited and pointed out the lake they visited. The weather on Hyacinth was just enough to make the lake sparkle as the small waves reflected the already reflected sunlight. Yon indulged them a few minutes to take in the view.

  


""It's it lovely? I love the LEO Confederation, Undersea Titan, and even Venus, but the view of Hyacinth from up here is just... so *human,*‚Äù someone said. At that, Selkirk‚Äôs ears twitched. They all turned to see a human shaped woman, dressed in a smartly tailored business suit in royal blue with bright yellow accents. Her blond hair was close copped and spiky on her head. There was the hint of tattoos sticking out of her collar. She looked at them with steely blue eyes and while she had a kind expression, Nick had a feeling that she wore fury as easily as she wore kindness.¬†

  


Additionally, there was a glowing crown made of light and dust glowing *very* slightly over her head, *almost* invisible in the daylight of Hyacinth.

  


Selkirk put her hands on her hips defiantly, but Nick could see her tail was puffed out and the very tip was shaking. ‚ÄúSo uh, what‚Äôs the protocol here? Do we bow?‚Äù She looked over at Eastern, but said nothing.

  


Empress Helen Raaden laughed, gently. ‚ÄúI am... unofficial here. There's no need for any of that right now. *Technically* I do not exist."" She glanced over at Yon and then back to the three of them. ""Well, I do exist, I own Houndstooth after all, but you know what I mean."" As Nick and the others stood back up she smiled and the crown disappeared. ""I'm sorry if I startled you. Our number is still rather small, even after all these years, so I have the ability to introduce myself to our newcomers. I‚Äôm happy you are here and agreed to join us."" She reached out her hand. ""Please. Call me Raaden.""¬†

  


Nick, Eastern and Selkirk took her hand in turn and shook. When it was Nick‚Äôs turn, he felt the tingle of encryption keys being transferred. He blinked in astonishment and raised his eyebrows. Raaden winked and turned her head slightly. At the base of her neck were the same 10 cybernetic link ports Nick had.¬†

  


Eastern looked at them, confused. ""But, you're the *Empress*. You don't need‚Ä¶ all that, do you?""

  


‚ÄúTechnically I don't."" She touched the back of her had absently, and then she looked sharply at Eastern. ‚ÄúThough I suppose, neither do *you.‚Äù*

  


Raaden turned to look at Yon, who nodded once. ‚ÄúI verified it myself, Empress. Eastern has Nanites, *and* can use the Voice.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúThat is‚Ä¶ interesting.‚Äù Raaden said, and crossed the distance to Eastern in a flash. The Empress was a head taller than Eastern, made even more evident by the high heels she was wearing. Raaden leaned in close, locking eyes with Eastern. She noticed that she was wearing a scent. Very faint, with a touch of bergamot. ‚ÄúWhy can *you* do things only an *Empress* can do Eastern Standard?‚Äù

  


Eastern tried not to take a step back when Raaden got close. She almost succeeded. ‚ÄúI.. I don‚Äôt know. Jameson gave me the Nanites, and then Gord said that he was sure I would do ‚Äòthe right thing‚Äô.‚Äù

  


At the mention of Gord, Raaden‚Äôs face darkened. ‚ÄúSo. The king of the AI faction continues to meddle.‚Äù She said, and then in a flash her face brightened and she stepped back. ‚ÄúNo matter. This is not entirely unheard of. Melody and Janais both had the Empress package, and their Nanites worked it out. I am confident the same will happen to us.‚Äù She turned towards a door on the roof and began walking. Yon fell into step behind her and turned towards Nick, Eastern, and Sel and gestured, irritatedly.¬†

  


‚ÄúFor now, there will be no Builders; those who share the Nanites gift but are unable to do the things an Empress can.‚Äù Raaden said as they walked, without turning to make sure they were there. Eastern felt the hairs on the back of her neck rise when Raaden was speaking. ‚ÄúThe AI faction's weapons are such that that option is closed to us for now. As I have said to others, there will be no Builders as long as there is the damned anti-Nanite gas.‚Äù As they walked down the hall, Nick noticed the art on the walls. It seemed to be semi-stylized paintings of scenes from space, starships, and more than a few of - he assumed - Empress Melody. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm learning that... long term plans are necessary when dealing with people who can live more than a thousand years."" Nick risked a glance at Eastern who followed along, at the end of the line, looking at the windows, the art, the floor, behind them. Anywhere but at Raaden.

  


At the end of the hall was an opulent apartment, with floor to ceiling glass walls offering views of Hyacinth, rich furnishings, and a bustling staff. Raaden sat in one of the couches, her back to Hyacinth. She spread her arms and hung them over the back of the couch and put her feet up on a cushion that was already in place. Even though she was impeccably put together, she simultaneously was able to look completely at ease. ""Can I offer you anything? Tea? Coffee? I have *excellent* coffee. I never liked it as much as Melody did - I was too used to ship's instant - but in her memory I keep some of the finest coffee I can source. I promise, it's excellent.‚Äù Her face lit up at a memory, ‚ÄúSelkirk, I have some tea you might be interested in. It's some of the first chamomile grown on K'laxi. I'm told that the planets physiology makes for an interesting cup."" She snapped her fingers sharply.

  


Nearly instantly a person came out carrying a tray with four cups and two sealed pots, one of coffee and one of tea. Raaden poured the tea into the cups herself. ""I'll admit that even though I keep fine coffee around, these days I rather prefer tea."" She took the mug and held it up. ""To new beginnings."" and took a sip.

  


Nick, Eastern and Selkirk took their cups hesitantly, but joined in the toast and drank their drinks as well. Nick had to admit, the coffee *was* excellent.

  


Raaden put her cup down. ""Now then. We must try something.‚Äù She stood up.¬†

  


‚ÄúSÃ∏ÃΩÕñtÃ∏ÃøÃùaÃ∂Õ†ÃünÃ¥ÃéÃôdÃ∑ÃäÕï ÃµÃâÃñuÃ∑ÃæÃòpÃ¥ÃëÃ§.Ã¥ÕÉÕô the three of you.‚Äù

  


Nick and Selkirk immediately stood, so fast that Nick‚Äôs coffee sloshed in his cup and he spilled a little. Eastern stood up as well, *almost* as fast as Nick and Selkirk.

  


*Not fast enough, Eastern. She* ***knows*** *you aren‚Äôt affected by the Voice.*

  


‚ÄúOh no.‚Äù Eastern said, her voice almost a whisper.

  


‚ÄúOh no, indeed.‚Äù Raaden tutted and sat back down. ‚ÄúWhatever are we going to do about you, Eastern?‚Äù She looked up to the entrance to the kitchen and a K'laxi accented voice from the kitchen called out, laughing. ‚ÄúHelen, don‚Äôt you go killing them or anything; they just arrived.‚Äù Raaden smiled, but Eastern noticed that her face flashed rage for just the briefest moment.

  


A K'laxi walked in holding another mug of tea. She looked older than Selkirk, with deep red fur with streaks of grey starting to appear around her muzzle. She was also wearing a blue suit with yellow accents. ""Hello, I'm Um'reli, the last Builder. Nice to meet you.""

  


Nick heard the capital letters. ""The last Builder? Raaden said that the Builders were gone?""

  


Um'reli's ears flattened. ""Yes. They are. I'm the last one. The rest were‚Ä¶ killed by the AIs. I was with Hel-Raaden when we escaped. Honestly, I should have been on my own ship at the time. Though, if that had happened I would have died with all the rest."" She shrugged and her tail swished at the same time. ""I can only assume i'm here for a reason, so I do all I can to help out the Empress.""¬†

  


Selkirk stared at her tea a long time, and after a moment lifted her head and looked at Um'reli. ""You're a Builder.""

  


Um'reli nodded. ""I am.""

  


‚ÄúAnd you have Nanites.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt a question.¬†

  


She nodded again. ""I do.""

  


""And you worked with the previous Empress, Melody.""

  


Um‚Äôreli‚Äôs face hardened. ‚ÄúMelody and I were *friends*. Even before she became Empress. We worked together on Far Reach, the Starjumper that brought us out. When Far Reach left, I stayed and helped Melody. Because I was friends with her. Because I believed in her. I didn‚Äôt just *work with her.‚Äù*

  


‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to imply that you were *just* working with her, I‚Äôm trying to get a handle on-‚Äù she gestured around the room ‚Äú-all this.‚Äù She locked eyes with Um‚Äôreli. ‚ÄúWhy? Why did you throw in with her?‚Äù

  


Um'reli‚Äôs expression softened and she chuckled lightly. ""Well, at the time, I wanted some of the power that Melody seemed to have. You have to understand, we were all from this side of the galaxy. What would you do if your friend suddenly became all-powerful and said 'hey, you want in on this too?'""

  


Selkirk took another sip of her tea. ""I see.""

  


Um'reli nodded, her ears flicking. ""But, as time went on, I realized how much stress Melody was under. How *hard* it was. How much she was trying to help everyone. I wanted to make her job easier, to give her a break."" She looked out at Hyacinth and continued. ""I... I was devastated when she died. It's been ten years. It still hurts, it always will,‚Äù She sighed. ‚ÄúBut, the work goes on."" She broke her gaze with Hyacinth and looked at Nick, Eastern and Selkirk. ""We're here to help. It won't be easy, and everyone won't see it that way. We'll probably have to fight again. This time though, we'll be ready, and we're hoping what we're doing now can get across the idea that we're here to help better.""

  


‚ÄúRaaden.‚Äù Eastern said, looking at her. She raised an eyebrow, curious.¬†

  


‚ÄúYes, Eastern?‚Äù

  


‚ÄúWhy are we here?‚Äù

  


‚ÄúYou mean like philosophically or-‚Äù Raaden smirked, she couldn‚Äôt help it.

  


‚ÄúNo, why are Nick, Selkirk and I, here in *your* penthouse on Houndstooth One chatting with the richest person in Sol and *the Empress*. Not even this morning we were three nobodies on Hyacinth who were working with Jameson Winters to try and track down his lost daughter. Now he‚Äôs dead and we-‚Äù¬†

  


At the mention of Jameson being dead, Yon gasped. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs *what?‚Äù*

  


Eastern caught herself and looked at Yon, her face startled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Yon, he might not be dead, but Gord took some kind of crystal lattice memory cube and‚Ä¶ backed him up to it. His body was empty when Gord was done. He said it was his ‚Äòplan B‚Äô‚Äù

  


‚ÄúAh. There it is.‚Äù Raaden said, leaning forward. ‚ÄúThe missing piece. We knew the crystal lattice prototype was stolen from our lab, but we didn‚Äôt know who or why. This at least explains why.‚Äù

  


Nick worked *extremely hard* to show no emotion on his face. Selkirk and Eastern did not look at him.

  


‚ÄúBut Helen, ‚ÄúUm‚Äôreli said ‚ÄúWhy would Gord want to back up AIs? They can either leave somewhere on their own, or they can go into a coffin box.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúGord made it sound like the coffin box was almost worse than death. He made it sounds like something he didn‚Äôt want to subject anyone to.‚Äù Selkirk said.¬†

  


‚ÄúBut,‚Äù Eastern continued, ‚ÄúNone of this explains why us three are here, now.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúWell for one thing Eastern Standard, you have Nanites, and if Yon wasn‚Äôt lying, you can use the Voice, which means the Nanites think you‚Äôre a candidate for Empress.‚Äù Raaden said, taking another sip of tea.

  


‚ÄúMe? I‚Äôm not an Empress! I‚Äôm just some girl from Luna.‚Äù Eastern said quickly.

  


‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right.‚Äù Helen said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre *not* an Empress.‚Äù¬†

  


‚ÄúYet.‚Äù Um‚Äôreli said. Nick caught that Raaden glared at her when she thought everyone wasn‚Äôt looking.

  


‚ÄúYet? What does that mean?‚Äù Between not showing his reaction to finding out Houndstooth didn‚Äôt know he stole the memory cube and all this Nanite talk, Nick was having a hard time following the conversation.¬†

  


‚ÄúTell me Eastern,‚Äù Raaden said, as she got up from the couch and walked back to the full length windows overlooking Hyacinth. ‚ÄúDo the Nanites talk to you?‚Äù

  


*Tell her no. If you wish to survive until tomorrow, tell her no.* The thought from the Nanites was almost overwhelming to Eastern. She felt the presence pressing down on her, nearly begging her to answer their way.

  


‚ÄúTalk to me? I don‚Äôt know what you mean? I haven‚Äôt heard anything.‚Äù Eastern said. She was a natural liar, it‚Äôs why she was such a good con artist.¬†

  


She noticed Raaden‚Äôs shoulders relax subtly. It was just the barest thing, but Eastern was sure she was more relaxed now. ‚ÄúGood. I‚Äôm glad to hear it.‚Äù She turned and looked at them all. ‚ÄúIt appears that I have a new Builder. We should celebrate this development, but for now I have to get back to the work of being the richest person in Sol.‚Äù Her smile was mirthless. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to you later.‚Äù

  


With hardly any fanfare or ceremony at all, Empress Helen Raaden walked out of the penthouse.¬†

  


Eastern turned to Yon. ‚ÄúSo, when are you going to tell me what happened to the real Siobhan?‚Äù",7,1736512443.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

This is going to be a long-term thing. I hope you're happy to be stuck with me. I'm not going to stop emailing you. You can run but I will find you and I will eat you... okay, wait that's not how it goes hahaha, whatever you get the point.



Now into the email.



\*Clears throat\*



So who am I?



You can call me Anita, I'm thirty years old, I'm a female (I know, shocker hahaha), I'm mixed race (half black half white although most people think I'm white because I'm quite pale). I'm a full-time author (of contemporary gay romances. Hey I love love and I love star-crossed lovers who have to fight against the world to be together). I'm definitely not rich, more middle class, but definitely not searching for money or any free passes in life. 



And no I'm not searching for rich husband  (You have to say it in a Russian accent. Don't let me down!) hahaha. And no I don't work at a call center hahaha. Oh, that reminds me. I'm from Africa. And no, I know the stereotypes linger but I'm not a scam artist, I don't want anything from you except the sweet, sweet, satisfaction of getting another letter from you where you sarcastically insult me hahaha (please do, I love that).



Also quick question:



What is your MBTI personality? I know, some people don't believe in this. Especially INTPS. But humour me for a second. I would love to know what your personality is. For me, I like knowing the personality not because I decide anything in terms of it. It's more so I can know what makes you tick. I'm an INFJ and I love finding out how people's minds work. I love psychology a lot. I love learning about habits and the subconscious. Okay, I'll leave that question there.



Physical appearance:



I have dark eyes that look like black holes. They are these two doe-like eyes that seem to put any man under a spell. And no that's not my own words. That's been told to me and proven over and over. Regardless, they're black but actually dark brown. And they're huge hahaha. My skin colour is pale but supposedly tan. I don't get a lot of sun. I might be a vampire. In fact, my favourite colour is black so maybe I am. I never quite got out of my emo phase). I have darkish brown hair that shines reddish brown in the sun. I used to have golden strands in my hair as a kid. It all disappeared as I grew up. I still miss them. They made me look like a sun hahaha. I'm 171 cm in height (yes the metric system is the best system in the world, fight me, America). 



I'm full figured or I guess what people would call bbw these days. I don't know, I have a weird relationship with my weight. I've been told I might have body dysmorphia and I might not be able to see my weight the way other people do. I have no idea. People say I'm not as fat as I think I am, that I'm actually just curvy but to me when I look in the mirror I see something I hate. But anyway that's for another time, hahaha. I have no tattoos, though I do think they look cool. I don't have any piercings not even the normal kind. I have a birthmark in a very strange part of my body but I'm not disclosing that until I've known you so long there is nothing we don't know about each other. Remember, we're in this for the long haul. You're stuck with me. 



Our theme song will forever be Stuck With You by Ariana and Justin. Remember that when we go on a random game show and have to answer questions about each other in the future while pretending like we don't despise each other (well that's how they always look on those shows to me). I blink a lot. It's because I have two illnesses in my eyes. Do I know what they are? Of course not! My doctor neve told me hahaha. I was too nervous, okay, so I didn't ask. I hate socializing with people in person. I have no disabilities unless you count the fact that I can't drive hahaha and I'm mentally insane and have verbal diarrhea (damn for a writer I suck at spelling. I literally had to go search up how to spell diarrhea. I was a bit afraid I'd get pictures from google but luckily they spared me the emotional damage). 



Like any other introverted person, I slouch when I walk. I often rock back and forth in my chair or bob my leg up and down. I have the balance of a seal. Actually, no, wait. They have good balance. Okay, I have the balance of a slinky. Yeah, that one's better. I suck at most things in life and I'm extremely average to below average but I don't care because, heck, my life's almost over so it's fine. Let's just drink some coffee and enjoy it. I might have a slight (okay a huge) addiction to coffee. It's my moon blood hahaha (I'll send you the video about the moon blood reference one day).



HOBBIES:



I love story. I love movies in general. I love writing (obviously since it's my job, you know?). I love horror and sci-fi. It's hard to pick a favourite horror since I've watched so many and loved so many. I would say general horror my favourite is a very unknown one called Pet that came out in 2016. More popular one I'd say The Thing. And a funny one I'd say The Sand (it was ridiculous but I loved it). Honourable mention would be Cloverfield (The original found footage one. I have very good memories with that one). Favourite Sci-Fi movie would probably be the whole Alien Franchise. I know a lot of people would probably say The Martian or Interstellar. Yeah, I liked it but it's not my favourite. 



Nothing beats Alien. From a story concept and execution aspect it's honestly brilliant. I love anime. My favourite anime is Bleach. My favourite anime movie is Your Name. My favourite movie in general is The Lake House but if Asian then it's My Rainy Days (this one honestly makes me cry so much and feel so happy at the same time). I love video games and I've always wanted to play them (there are reasons why I don't but I will eventually). I love watching someone game. I can literally watch it the whole day and I'd be so happy. 



I love simulation games, I love RPGs with great stories, I love shooter games or zombie games, I love horror games. Some of my favourites are Bus, Food truck and Thief Simulator (simulations), Beyond: Two Souls, Halo, Detroit: Become Human, Horizon (RPGs), DayZ, Silent Hill, Resident Evil, etc (Zombie and Horror). I also love indie games that have a psychological aspect to it. The ones that make you think ""What the actual fuck"" at the end of it.



Okay, I'll leave this here for now. I know I wrote a bunch of crap but humour me at least and find it a little bit interesting. I'm literally tired after writing this hahaha but it was so fun. I'd do it in an instant again. You haven't even said anything back and I already enjoy it. Perhaps if you don't respond I'll just continue writing new post here over and over. It's really fun and kind of therapeutic. Plus, who knows, maybe you'd actually read them eventually.



But okay that's it for now.



Talks soon, maybe.

Also please for the love of everything don't send me a picture of yourself, okay? I like the mystery. I've always been more interested in the person's mind than their face. For example, when I fall in love I fall for the person's personality, mind, humour, etc. I never fall in love by their looks. It's pointless, it means nothing. It's why dating sites never work for me. It's called being Demisexual. But anyway, not that we're on a romantic basis or anything. I just wanted you to know why I don't want a picture of you. If you ever send pictures in the future please do me the honour of blurring your face or putting an emoji sticker over it.



I will however send pictures of myself. I guess it's only fair if you know how I look. 



Don't laugh at my pictures. I will find out and I will eat you... yes, this time I mean it.

1hy3eoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1hy3eoh/alam_na_niya_na_alam_ko/,"Alam na niya, na alam ko...","Nag-aya akong mag coffee kay bf kasi finally natapos na year-end project ko sa work and I wanted to celebrate.

Went inside the coffee shop, and bam! There she was, talking animatedly to her little family. Laughing carelessly, without a care to the world. As if she isn‚Äôt the reason na nadudurog na naman ang puso ko. Oh Angela, kung alam mo lang..

Nagkatinginan kami ng asawa niya and when he saw me, he smiled widely and waved at us to come to their table. My bf went stiff at kinailangan ko pa siya hilahin ng kaunti.

We went over to their table and talked about precursory things that are expected of friends that haven't seen each other for years. Nasa Pinas pala sila for a short holiday. They sound so happy, and naive that 2 hearts are breaking at the same time at that moment.

3 years ago, I made the mistake of opening an untitled document in my bf‚Äôs Google drive while looking for another document he asked me to print out. It was a letter my bf wrote addressed to Angela dated on her wedding day which was at that point, almost 2 years ago na since the wedding happened. He poured his heart out on that letter, confessing how long he‚Äôs been secretly loving her and how devastated he is that she doesn't see him as anything other than a friend. At the end, he didn‚Äôt have the guts to send the letter.

The worst part? It seems that the reason why he pursued me was because he found in me the little things he loved about her. Outspoken, witty, minimalist, and we both even play the same sports. It was like I was loved for all the subtle reasons. I‚Äôm her poor copy. And rather than seeing me for who I really am, he saw the things that made me a little bit more like Angela and a little less me.

Kaya pala nagyaya siyang mag out of country sa mismong date ng kasal ni Angela. I didn't know then. The only reason why nag attend siya sa wedding is because mismong si Angela yung nag convince sa kanya na ipagpaliban muna yung travel. Hanggang sa huli, he was loyal to his feelings to this woman.

Why did I stay? Because I saw how much he tried to love me even if it broke him to be with me instead of her. When I read that letter, the pieces just clicked together. Kaya pala‚Ä¶ A part of him died the day Angela wed her fiance. He cut-off the friend group he had with Angela and went AWOL on social media. It took him almost a year bago nabalik yung sigla niya. I thought nung una, he is just going through some rough patch sa career niya kaya naging ganun siya which was kind of true.

We walked out of that coffee shop as fast as we could after our brief hellos. We just reasoned out na for take out lang talaga yung order namin since may ibang lakad pa kami.

While driving home, we were both quiet. Siguro gusto ko narin i unload yung sarili ko sa burden of knowing, so I held his hand, and told him, ‚ÄúI know. ‚Äú He pulled over a few blocks from our house and wept.

My heart ached seeing him weeping with regret, longing, and guilt. I‚Äôm still choosing to stay. I will fight for his love ‚Äòtil I‚Äôm no longer a shadow of his dream.

1hy3dyf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hy3dyf,"Gaggia Classic 3 years after, my method, experience and joy ‚òï","I have gone through different phases, especially with the needs that this forum creates for you, beyond experimenting and adapting to the stock coffee machine without modifications. I have had my Gaggia Classic for three years, I bought it from a distributor in Madrid for under 300‚Ç¨ (308$), and now it's currently with me in Asturias, North of Spain. I have always used it with purchased mineral water üóª, never with tap water. The only modification made was to lower the working pressure to 9 bar and throw away the pressurized filter üöÆ. I have gone through periods of only latte, only espresso and now back to latte, also iced latte in summer. 

üí° I have tried preheating the coffee machine for 15 minutes and many other techniques. I finally get the best coffees (latte or espresso for both 1 and 2 extractions in a row) with the first heating cycle (first time the LED lights up), and the steam with the ideal pressure in the second heating cycle (in the first one I take advantage to remove condensed water from the tube), but if I make two extractions in a row, the boiler is hotter and I can use the steam with the right pressure in the first cycle. In total, making 1-2 lattes takes me 4-5 minutes ‚òï, and they are the best minutes of the day. For all this to go well I have an Eureka Mignon Silenzio grinder (150‚Ç¨), the first thing I did when I unpacked it was to see if I could grind it fine enough to clog the coffee maker, and I could, so it was the perfect grinder. From there with each coffee in the first extractions I perfect and adjust the degree of grinding to obtain 36-40g of drink for 18g of coffee in 28-32 seconds preserving sweetness on soft roasted coffees (my preferred choice). Since I usually put a whole packet of coffee in the hopper and it gets oxygenated over the days, I adjust the grind a little (finer) every x days. This is what works best for me, and I like to have to experiment a little with the coffee maker with each coffee, even though I have achieved consistency. I need to say that I always use the scale to check grind and extractions, and also for the milk/oat milk. 

‚úàÔ∏è In addition to all this, I focused on discovering new coffees and looking for the flavours that I like the most (same extracting). I have friends who are very fond of and knowledgeable, one of them takes photos of all the speciality coffee shops in Madrid and constantly recommends roasters to us. On trips I always take the opportunity to bring something from a local roaster.

Now it's time to learn latte art üé®.

*Footnotes:* 

1) One item missing from the list is the 'Chicken Wrap' from the redemption page. When I go to order, I don't see a single 'Chicken Wrap', just duos. I don't know if they're the same, but I left this one out due to ambiguity.

2) Some redemptions were vague as they would say 'Biscuit sandwich' but didn't specify which one (there are 4 different biscuit sandwiches), so I made the assumption that they meant you could redeem for any of the four, even though there are price differences between them.

I am looking for books that don‚Äôt contain any of the bad things going on in the world (politics, climate change, inequality/racism/homophobia, war etc). I would prefer if these topics aren‚Äôt even mentioned at all, even as jokes or internal monologue etc. I don‚Äôt want to hear about a toxic ex, or how capitalism is getting them down or how they were discriminated against. Of course these things are real and important to write and read about, but I just can‚Äôt handle it at the moment. 


I don‚Äôt really mind what subgenre of book is being recommended, I‚Äôm open to anything, as long as it‚Äôs cozy (contemporary, fantasy, sci-fi, historical whatever! I like it all). I just want to read about people and communities being happy and supporting each other, with very minimal bad things happening. Essentially I‚Äôm looking for the book equivalent of a nice cup of tea or a warm hug - perfectly comforting. 


As an example I loved Legends & lattes by Travis Baldree. I know something bad happens in that book ( >!someone burns down the coffee shop!< ), but in my mind the way the characters deal with it is very wholesome in a way. I.e. the bad thing happens but the MCs pick themselves back up and keep going, as a community. I hope that makes sense. Just generally I want the mood to be optimistic and wholesome!


I looked through the cozy megathread and some of them seemed a bit intense for what I‚Äôm looking for right now - so I thought I‚Äôd ask a more specific question. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated! Thank you :) ",24,1736511951.0,RomanceBooks,24,0.94,False

The rain poured down in sheets. There was no natural light, so flying by instruments was the only option. I watched as the windshield wipers helplessly slapped water away from the screen, even though it was useless in the darkness. Lightning periodically lit up the cockpit. The controls glowed a crisp green.

I checked the altimeter: 4,500 meters. That‚Äôs perfect, I thought. I pulled the control stick hard left, aiming low between two peaks twice my altitude. A holographic display of my position against the terrain appeared in front of me, with the aircraft sailing neatly between the two peaks. My passengers and I were shoved against our restraining harnesses as the aircraft experienced extreme turbulence through the canyon. However, I was not affected by this at all. It was just another day at the office after all.

‚ÄúWind at 70 knots due east,‚Äù I said to my co-pilot.

‚ÄúAdjusting lateral gravity boosters to compensate, Lt. Cray,‚Äù 2nd Lieutenant Orni replied.

‚ÄúCommand, this is Big Bird. We are three clicks north of the evac point. Over.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe copy that, Big Bird. Be careful. LZ may be ho... chssssss. We lost sichhhh with the target about ten minutes ago. Over. We have a positive reading on one target but no vitals. The other one is MIA.‚Äù

‚ÄúCopy that, Command. Big Bird out.‚Äù

I stared at my instruments and raised my voice.  
  


‚ÄúDo you hear that, fellas? LZ could be hot. When we get on the ground, I need everyone to spread out and keep your eyes peeled. Riton patrols could be in the area. We lost our boys‚Äô signal some ten minutes ago, so we won‚Äôt know exactly where he is. We might be on the ground longer than planned. After you egress, I will keep the engines hot and provide aerial cover. Don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthis bird has plasma chains that will tear any Riton to shreds within a click Just laze them and let them have it. If things get too spicy down there, I‚Äôll come back down to pick you up. Got it?‚Äù

I heard the familiar ‚ÄúOoh Rah!‚Äù in unison from the back of the troop transport. I smiled. This was the life, I thought to myself. I was starting to get addicted to the buzz behind my skull. 

‚ÄúSir, we are T-minus three minutes from the LZ. Heartbeat scanner is active. I‚Äôm not picking anything up on the scanners. Checking... hmm. Wow, what is that? Man, that is a massive energy reading,‚Äù 2nd Lt. Jim Orni pointed to the orange dot on the screen.

I peeked at it out of the corner of my eye, maintaining focus on the flight.

‚ÄúLt. Cray, look at that!‚Äù

‚ÄúPhew, that is quite the reading. Are you sure the number is right?‚Äù I pushed the control stick slightly down.

‚ÄúUnless the instrument is off, that reading is off the charts.‚Äù Numbers scrolled over 2nd Lt. Orni‚Äôs eyes. ‚ÄúMy God, it‚Äôs giving off power readings like it‚Äôs an orbital carrier.‚Äù

‚ÄúCopy that, Orni.‚Äù

‚ÄúBig Bird to Command,‚Äù I squawked over the comms.

‚ÄúThis is Command. Go ahead.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are experiencing a malfunction on our sensors. We are getting some unusually high power readings. Are you seeing that on your end? Over.‚Äù

‚ÄúCommand to Big Bird. We see it‚Ä¶‚Äù There was a long pause, a slight crackle, and distortion came through the speaker.

Lt. Orni slammed the panel with his fist. ‚ÄúDamn bucket of shit,‚Äù he exclaimed as his fist struck the panel. The comms panel stopped showing static, and the light once again turned solid green.

‚ÄúBig Bird, do you read us?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is Big Bird. We can hear you now. The storm is knocking out our comms as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, we copy that. It‚Äôs fine. Your power reading sensors are malfunctioning. There is no way you could be seeing those kinds of numbers. You‚Äôre clear to proceed with the mission. Make sure you bring that bird in after for a full diagnostic. That is an order Lt. Cray.‚Äù

‚ÄúCopy that, Command.‚Äù



\*\*\*\*

A gust of wind suddenly lifted the bird into the air and slammed it back down again violently. I clung to my harness for dear life. Now my stomach was doing backflips. I listened to the chatter inside the craft. ‚ÄúThere is no way you could be seeing those kinds of numbers.‚Äù Despite my current state, I made a mental note.

Suddenly the aircraft lurched skyward, peaked, then slammed back down like an airtime hill on a roller coaster. I hate rollercoasters. I hate flying vehicles. I hate hyper sleep. When I awoke from that, I didn‚Äôt eat for 3 days. I couldn‚Äôt keep anything down. They tried to give me Dramamine. However Dramamine doesn't work on Talaxans. I don't think the medical officer knew that. 

Now my stomachs were upside down. The room started to spin. That‚Äôs when I felt it. I heaved a little, and my stomachs emptied their contents into my mouth. I must have looked extremely green. My cheeks bulged out, filled with the contents of my lunch and some coffee. My eyelids closed sideways twice. 

I tried to hide it, but when I looked to my left, I noticed a beefy human marine staring right at me with a stupid grin. ‚ÄúFirst time, Dr. Worton? Welcome to the STAT III, best rollercoaster in town.‚Äù Sgt. Stonewall chewed a piece of gum. He blew a giant bubble that popped in my face. His breath was beyond foul.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter, is Moon face gonna puke, Sgt.?‚Äù Another voice from my left rang out. The entire unit was about to burst out in a laughing fit.

This was not going well. I‚Äôm not going to lie about it. I was out of place.

Sweat poured down my pointy chin. I was still holding the puke in my mouth. I swallowed. ‚ÄúI'm okay, don‚Äôt worry about me.‚Äù I tried to act normal.

Sgt. Stonewall popped another bubble during the awkward silence and stared directly into my eyes. A putrid mix of chewing tobacco and whisky washed over me. It was too much.

Lt. Cray broke the silence. ‚ÄúDr. Worton, if you eject your puke in my aircraft, I will open that door and eject you. Do you understand me?‚Äù

All of a sudden, there was another jerk. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I opened my mouth and spilled the contents of my ham sandwich and coffee with half-and-half directly on Sgt. Stonewall‚Äôs uniform.

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm so sorry, let me fix that.‚Äù I pulled out my handkerchief and started rubbing his uniform.

Sgt. Stonewall just sat there very expressionless and with no emotion. I must have looked very pathetic. He popped his third and final bubble.

‚ÄúLt. Cray. Permission to eject the good doctor out of the aircraft,‚Äù Sgt. Stonewall said as professionally as he could muster..

That is when Lt. Cray surprised me.

‚ÄúPermission granted, Sgt.,‚Äù he replied, without ceremony.

Next thing I know, violent sheets of water were splashing on my face. Sgt. Stonewall had me by the harness while he opened the hatch. The aircraft gave another violent lurch, but Sgt. Stonewall‚Äôs massive arm kept me in place. He spun me around. Then I felt a swift kick in my ass, and I was in full free fall. The other marines probably thought that was funny.

Rain stung my face as I accelerated to the ground. I gritted my teeth and closed my eyes. My chest fins gasped for air. A violent flash of lighting showed how high I was. 

*I‚Äôm really not getting paid enough to die,*  I thought as I tumbled through the void.

 I was in full spin-dry mode. I tumbled to what I thought would be my death, but at the last moment, I felt a sharp but gradual deceleration. My grav harness glowed a light blue. Just about 4 feet from the ground, I came to a stop. Then the grav harness‚Äôs lights turned off, and I fell to my knees.

Then I remembered the pre-flight briefing.

‚ÄúIn the event that you must evacuate the aircraft mid-flight, this grav harness will save your life. You do not have to worry about anything. It will decelerate you and land you on the ground softly.‚Äù

I proceeded to deposit the rest of my lunch and coffee on the ground.

Moments later, the STAT III whizzed by me. The hot plasma emanating from its thrusters stung my face with heat. I raised my puke soaked hand to shield myself but that only caused the puke to re apply to my face dry and crack.

Sgt. Stonewall was the first to jump out. He patted me on the back. ‚ÄúWelcome to Riton, Dr. Worton.‚Äù

The other marines in the aircraft filed out. They all gave me a reassuring pat on the head as they fanned out to secure the perimeter.

This was going to be quite a fucking day.

Had this account on the back burner for several years but due to time/family constraints I just haven‚Äôt been able to do anything with it. I hope to be as consistent as I can.


My aim would be to do weekly recaps of the YT channels that I‚Äôm watching anyway, open to requests on the ones I don‚Äôt currently watch. I‚Äôm pretty fluent in Duggar/Bates family history and would be geared more towards them. 


I‚Äôd be in keeping with the general tone of the sub, part snark ‚Äì part genuine curiosity on the dynamics of the huge families who are now growing their own.


We have our Queen DixCGirl10 and I would never step on her toes, this is a more detailed focus on YouTube to save clicks as I‚Äôd be watching most of them anyway, rather than their social media as a whole.

**Travis & Katie: ‚ÄúWE BOUGHT OUR DREAM HOME IN TENNESSEE!‚Äù**


Intro: Travis & Katie announce they are officially Tennessee homeowners. 


Flashback to earlier that week where they announce they have secretly bought a house, and at that point they are 3 days from closing. They have been driving by it 2-3 times a week and are so excited to get all the final paperwork done. The house looks awesome and also new for 2025, Travis is back playing basketball which he hasn‚Äôt done since moving to TN. They are in a parking lot outside a gym and we get the first of many mentions of Chomps this video. Cut to inside the gym and another look at Travis opening the Chomp, followed by shots of the Basketball game. The Bates parents showed up to the game and we hear Kelly Jo cheering in the background of some of the shots. (Interesting side note: All the banners in the gym are for the Red Devils, the irony!)


Back in the apartment, they tell Hailey they are buying a new house ‚Äútamarrow‚Äù. They are so excited and have been praying it works out after the last time (they had a secondary offer on a house but the primary offer went through) because Katie was excited then sad when it didn‚Äôt work out. As soon as they realized they were not getting the previous home, the search began again with Zach as their realtor. Zach sent the house listing, Travis hadn‚Äôt seen it despite obsessively checking house websites and apps for 6-12 months. This house has been on the market ‚Äúfor a little bit‚Äù and they believe the listing did not do the house justice due to missing rooms in the pictures and interesting angles, but that it worked in their favour as they loved it as soon as they seen it. They put an offer in on sight after trusting God to show them their house and if it wasn‚Äôt the one He would close the door. Zach called the next morning to congratulate them on being Tennessee homeowners, Travis faked out that they didn‚Äôt get it ‚Äì they wished they filmed this part. They waited to announce it due to closing times and various admin hurdles, but at this point they are now 24 hours from closing. They have a 10am walk through with Zach the next day once the owners have moved out. Travis says he has been watching them move out b/c he drives by the house often. The NJ house was purchased before they were even engaged so it‚Äôs the first time purchasing a home together. Michaela is coming over to babysit the kids so they can concentrate on the signing and are preparing clothes and snacks the night before (Spoiler: It‚Äôs Chomps). 
Travis clears up some toys for B Roll, then shows Hailey chasing Remy.
Cue the Chomps sponsorship. They cut to Gil Bates raving about Chomps too. I‚Äôm tired of typing Chomps at this point‚Ä¶


Closing Day 09:30am ‚Äì Carlin and Evan show up to the apartment with coffee and breakfast. Not entirely sure why since they are on their way out the door and Michaela arrives a minute later to watch the kids, but we move‚Ä¶


They arrive at the new house with Zach and you can see a detached double garage building with an upstairs (I‚Äôm guessing it will become a combination of gym/music studio/guest house), as well as a full garage on the house too. Outer of the house looks fresh white/black and interior is grey/white.


They are gushing over Zach for being the best realtor (based on the last video I kinda agree, Zach has been super invested in helping them and seems to genuinely care for Katie and her family, id be grateful to him too).


They arrive at Melrose Title Company early, Zach is there guiding them through the process, telling them the sodas will be the most expensive sodas they‚Äôll ever drink in their lives. They sign the papers and its official. Travis feels so much peace with this purchase and they are now ready to celebrate.


Zach and Evan are the only family members to have seen it at this point, so next we see Carlin and Evan watch Katie struggle to open the door, then Travis carries her over the threshold and there‚Äôs some B Roll of the main living space.


The following day they are preparing for the ice/snow forecasted for TN. They head to the house to show the kids and Kelly Jo and at least one other Bates kid. Hailey gets to see her room and asked if she wants it pink.


They show a small flash of the back garden which looks to have an enclosed outdoor porch area then Kelly Jo checks out the pantry (can‚Äôt wait to see 100 more Chomp or Thrive sponsors filmed there../s)
They end the video out with another huge Thank You to Zach and that next weeks video will be a sit down Q&A / House Update.

**The Stewart Fam: Looking back on a life with 19 kids! Gil Bates 60th Birthday Celebration!**


Opening: Evan & Carlin are in Pigeon Forge at Rowdy Bear Smoky Mountain Snow Park with their church. B Roll of Evan and Carlin on the tubes and the Avalanche Snow Coaster.


Next Zade is absolutely naturally sitting on one of 2 chairs in front of a camera, the other chair has the Thrive Market box ‚Äì I won‚Äôt recap the sponsored portions but shockingly, it‚Äôs for Thrive.

 
They are in the jeep to feel more ‚Äúcountry‚Äù for the family party at a cabin resort. They got back from Nashville the night before and are now repacked and ready for the Bates 60th Birthday/Post Christmas Party. They are car shopping at Cadillac since the previous family car was totalled. Carlin loved the ease of the Tesla and though she grew up driving 15 passenger vans she no longer feels comfortable with large cars since she didn‚Äôt drive for 2 years with her previous health issues. They are looking at Cadillacs, Lincoln Navigator and maybe another Tesla. They love the Cadillac, but it is huge for their family at the moment, and show the kids sitting in the back of one. Layla likes it better than the Tesla. 


They now go to Tesla and talk about how they are both indecisive but don‚Äôt feel like they need the Cadillac yet. No update just a hint/teaser that the Tesla dealership did not go as they had hoped.


At the Bates Celebration he flashes back to the night before where they went ATV off-roading (Muddin‚Äô ‚Äì who remembers that episode of BUB) then carol singing, presents for Grandkids.


Next day they are heading to Gil‚Äôs birthday and share that they bought him a new iPhone. Carlin says it‚Äôs a sentimental time and that ‚Äúmost all‚Äù of the siblings made it but 2 in Florida couldn‚Äôt make it (Alyssa and Jackson) and another sisters family got sick at the last minute (Josie).
We see Mama Jane (sporting a BSB sweater) taking in the view with Evan and asking how his parents are, she asks if his dad is still singing. Carlin comes over and says she‚Äôs just spotted Papa in his recliner asleep with a Western on and Jane replies ‚ÄúHe don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, I hate his crazy‚Äù which may have broken my heart a little but also the most Jane summary ever. Never take that woman‚Äôs Instagram away, I live for her comments.


Gil appears and Carlin and Evan heap praise on him for looking as good and in shape as he does at 60. Lawson and his spray on pants appear to say he‚Äôs ordering a new camera lens and he learns from the best (Evan).


There‚Äôs some B Roll of them all cooking out and taking pictures, Zade then helps Grandpa Gil with the hot dogs and burgers. More B Roll of Carlin with any sister but Erin, then Layla is at a crafting table before they eat. Zach / Lawson then share birthday praises about growing up with Gil and his dedication to working at a fair price to put food on the table for his family even when he could have and should have charged more.
Much of the next segment is Layla giving the present and then Carlin (the self proclaimed ‚Äúinsecure gift giver‚Äù) checking her Dad likes it because he had an iPhone Mini and this new phone is much bigger. His words were the only thing he loves better than a small phone is a free phone.


There‚Äôs some B roll and footage of the parents wearing blindfolds as all the kids take turns saying ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù and they have to guess who it is. Kelly is way quicker than Gil but it is a fun game when you have a million family members.


Outro: They loved the cabin and reminded Carlin of the good old days. It was chilled, the kids could play and then at nights they would meet up at other cabins and play cards. Upcoming for 2025: some car updates and Zade has upcoming speech therapy appointments. 

**Trace & Lydia: Papa Bates BIG 60th BIRTHDAY PARTY**

Intro: Quick preview of singing Happy Birthday to Gil Bates.


They too are getting ready to head to Gil Bates 60th Birthday party, Kelly Jo has been planning it for 6 months, most of the family are making it but it‚Äôs a 3 day getaway and they are hitting the road. 


They arrive to a cabin full of Bates, then the next day it is the birthday party day. Zach and Gil are grilling, it reminds Gil of the old days burning burgers. 


Ryker is loving all the mud and outdoor time and they say how many outfits they have to take. Trace asks Lydia how her first Bates party was back in the day  ‚Äì ‚Äúloud, a lot, couldn‚Äôt believe how many immediate family members there were‚Äù, but that it feels so long ago now.


Mama Jane is so excited to be there and credits ‚ÄúSweet Kelly Jo‚Äù for making sure they made it and loves seeing all the babies. Michaela is seen holding ‚ÄúHappy Alan‚Äù (Nathan and Esther‚Äôs baby who is actually called Graham) then Erin is miserable as Trace asks her if she‚Äôs moving back to TN. ‚ÄúNo.. maybe next year.‚Äù, and that she‚Äôs cried a lot about not moving back but they want to buy some land and build a house. Erin is thrilled when Trace says he and Lydia want to do the same and mentions several times they should do it together. William Payne is only 6 weeks younger than Ryker but the difference is huge, Ryker is roaming around while ‚ÄúWillie‚Äù is in the stroller.
Evan is admiring the camera set up and they talk about how its like the viewers are getting to attend because they will get several viewpoints through all the vlogs‚Ä¶ we might see Lawson‚Äôs some time in 2026. 


Lydia and Trace grab Kelly Jo to thank her for all the work she‚Äôs put into this trip. She credits the owners of the park as they go to church with them for allowing them to stay in several cabins.


Gil addresses everyone and thanks them for coming, for his life he doesn‚Äôt deserve and his family that have exceeded all his dreams. He prays over his Dad and then we cut to everyone making plates of food. 
They are out walking round the resort while Ryker is napping then we see B roll again of the family sharing praises on Gil, and then kids presents and the name game again (there‚Äôs only so many times I can recap the same footage!)

_______

If these are something you‚Äôd like me to continue, I‚Äôd be happy to do so.
I haven‚Äôt recapped Erin‚Äôs most recent video as I rarely watch hers and it is 9 days old at this point, and Alyssa‚Äôs ‚ÄúGoodbye.‚Äù video has already been so heavily discussed.


Have a great week,

1hy33ok,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1hy33ok/some_basics_for_beginners_i_suggest_taking_time/,Some basics for beginners. I suggest taking time to sit and grab a journal. ,"Hello everyone! I have seen a lot of questions about meditation that I get hung up on answering because I am so passionate about the inward journey, so I thought I would just make a post to share things you should know about meditation.
My intentions are to help anyone interested in the meditation practice, but to educate on what it's really all about.  
Going into it with the idea that it's just another thing to do like working out, without knowing these basics and just considering some breath work and mantra is going to be very limiting for you. 
Here are some must-knows about meditation.

1.Meditation is a Spiritual practice.
 
If the word spiritual is off putting to you,  think of another name for it is this, ""formless awareness.""
Here is an exercise to ponder on...

 Go back into your past, only Good memories.... Do this when you can take some time, close your eyes breathe and find some good ones...
What is the part of you that remembers and is aware of what it was to be 3 years old on a good memory? 
What part of you was present and aware when you were 12 and going through puberty? Can you find that same part of you that is aware of your body at the age you are now?

 This is your awareness, the part of you that is just aware, not identified with the conditions of what is happening with your age, your body or surroundings  and all of that at this moment. Because as you know, this age and present condition of your body is going to change...  further yourself on into the future. What part of you is it that will be aware if you are lucky enough to be an elderly person? 
If you can somewhat relate and find this part of you, you are on to what meditation is really all about. 

Some teachers refer to awareness is like the sky and then thoughts are like clouds passing by

2. It's important to know what the ego is and its function in the evolution of consciousness. 

The ego part of us is an absolutely necessary part that helps us to not only survive in the world but function as a seemingly separate ""person."" Btw, animals don't have one. That's why we want to be around them so much! 
So let's find your ego! If you were to tell someone about yourself as the way you see yourself, they may not see you that way, but that's the way you see yourself. That's your ego identity. Your name, age, gender, occupation, usually a bunch of negative stuff like unworthiness, and then some really overly confident thing like I'm the best at this or that. It's also the part of you that judges others and has hate for the oppositesband so on. 
For me, I'm a Mom and a Musician. I have identified heavily with those roles. But when I go down to McDonald's to get a coffee no one sees me like that.  They may just see a woman getting a coffee. I used to have to dress in a certain way where everyone knew I was a musician. When my kids started going off to college I freaked out and didn't know what to do with myself and that's when I became a musician. Here's where you can plug in the way you identify yourself.... 
In understanding this part of you you can understand your own suffering. When someone doesn't see us the way we want to be seen or the opposite we suffer. 
Suffering is there to show us where we are too identified with ourselves and we are meant to expand to accept new and more ways for ourselves.  For example,  me as a mother yes I'm a mother but I'm not only a mother so I didn't need to attach to only being a mother therefore I couldn't be other things. It is said that we can be everything!!

3. The real importance of Mantra.

When you say mantra a word or name for the Divine over and over, it's as if it fills in the space within your mind that would normally think.  So,  this gives you a chance to rise in your consciousness to be aware of that part of your mind. What's amazing is when you start with mantra after time it just starts doing it by itself and you will feel your expanded self(awareness) just watching it float by. You become more and more free.
Intrusive thoughts float by with no attachment, what someone said to you yesterday may come as a bothersome thought, it will just float by also, thus comes the Freedom!

4. You don't have to do breath work!  (But only if it just makes you happy) 

The goal is just to relax and to be with yourself, your real self. and to allow the lovely healing energies that are available within to flow and to enjoy your natural state of Being. 
If you've ever laid in the Sun in a relaxing way, or just relaxed in the beach, I suggest you adopt an idea about meditation in the same way as that. And I know people have a hard time relaxing at all, so to have a focal point is why any of that stuff is even so. Just follow your own guidance whatever works for you to relax!
Be mindful that the ego part of you is actually scared of the silence within and that's what all this resistance is about. The ego you is not wrong and some texts  will say that the ego must die and ego death and all of this but the ego is not to be hated upon.  It's part of us and we got here, so we should love it and nurture it and lovingly watch it. 
5. Lastly, the chakras
It's important to know that you have seven inner energy centers in your body. With adequate meditation practice you may feel sensations throughout different parts of your body. It's just where your body is relaxing enough to allow the inner flow to happen. Sometimes you can notice resistance or emotional pain in certain areas of your body and it is said that this one needs attention. The ultimate goal is to have all of your centers balanced and open placing your hand over your heart and another over your lower abdomen can help you to get more in touch with these sensations of the inner flow. 
You can do your own research to understand them more in depth and I am including a list of wonderful spiritual teachers who touch on all of these subjects that have helped me over the years! 

This is it for now.  I hope each one of you will try to incorporate these understandings and ask yourself you're true intentions about meditation and what it is you seek from the practice. 
Blessings to all!
