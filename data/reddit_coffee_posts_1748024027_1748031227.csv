I love discovering new brands, trying out different scents, and I get genuinely excited about finding a new signature fragrance. I usually pick up my perfumes from Dubai, especially oud based ones because Middle Eastern perfumes just feel so much more luxurious and long-lasting compared to most of the European stuff.

Lately, I’ve been trying to explore Indian perfume brands. There’s so much buzz around niche Indian perfumers on Instagram, and I really wanted to support something local. So, like any rational person, I turned to reviews before making a purchase.

And that’s where the disappointment begins.

Every product had 4.7+ ratings with people raving about how “it lasted all day,” “smells better than highend designers,” etc. I took the bait, bought a couple and wow. What a letdown.

Yeah, they smelled nice at first, but the performance? Absolutely pathetic. By the 4-hour mark, they were completely gone. I kept sniffing my wrist wondering if I’d dreamt putting it on. It’s such a waste of money and so frustrating when you're trusting reviews to make an informed decision.

I’m genuinely convinced many of these reviews are fake or paid. No way so many people are giving 5 stars to something that fades before your first coffee break. It's so frustrating because I rely on the reviews before buying stuff online and when they are fake, you end up with garbage products.

1kttaaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1kttaaa/qcrit_upmarket_political_fiction_in_case_of/,"[QCrit] Upmarket political fiction - IN CASE OF REMOVAL - 95k words, 3rd attempt","I just began querying my political fiction manuscript, *In Case of Removal*. I have been working on this for over 4 years, and this is my third attempt at querying agents after a handful of rejections and lots of rewrites and developmental editing. Included below are my query letter, elevator pitch, and first 300 words. Any advice and feedback is greatly appreciated!

Dear \[agent name\],

What happens when an assassination thrusts a volatile political novice into the presidency—and his unraveling ignites a media firestorm and an internal effort to remove him from power?

That question lies at the heart of IN CASE OF REMOVAL, my 95,000-word upmarket political fiction novel. I am writing to seek your representation because \[personalization\]. The manuscript is complete and available upon request. This is a simultaneous submission, and I will promptly notify you if I receive an offer of representation elsewhere.

After President-elect Tom Anderson is assassinated on Inauguration Day, Vice President-elect Lester Greenspan, a Baptist pastor and recovering alcoholic, is catapulted into the presidency. Convinced his political rise was ordained by God, Greenspan’s desperation to maintain power triggers a destructive relapse that threatens both his administration and the foundations of American democracy itself. While his marriage collapses and his addiction takes hold, he weaponizes the press and clashes with an untrusting Congress—prompting his adversaries, led by newly appointed Vice President Art Wheeler, to quietly plot his removal from power.

As a cunning journalist exploits Greenspan’s unraveling to boost his own profile, an independent commission uncovers damning ties between Greenspan and a far-right extremist group responsible for the assassination. With a president spiraling and impeachment looming, his inner circle faces a brutal choice: uphold their principles—or watch the country collapse into chaos.

Told with elements of political satire and psychological suspense, IN CASE OF REMOVAL explores the fragility of American democracy and the corruption of faith and power. It uses the perils of addiction and authoritarianism to examine how political institutions can crumble not in spite of their design, but because of it. Following in the tradition of Robert Penn Warren’s ALL THE KING’S MEN, IN CASE OF REMOVAL will appeal to readers of Omar El Akkad’s AMERICAN WAR and Philip Roth’s THE PLOT AGAINST AMERICA, blending personal decline with political tragedy and literary depth.

\[one sentence bio\]. IN CASE OF REMOVAL is my debut novel, heavily informed by my professional experience, firsthand exposure to Washington power structures, and extensive research into constitutional law and religious ideology.

Attached/Pasted below are the \[required sample\]. You can reach me at \[contact info\]. Thank you for your time and thoughtful consideration.

Sincerely,

Elevator pitch:

After an Inauguration Day assassination thrusts a recovering alcoholic into the presidency, a damning investigation and media crusade expose his personal and political collapse—triggering a quiet internal effort to remove him before it’s too late.

First 300:

A gentle flurry of snow danced down upon Washington as a new chapter of American history rose with the morning sun. In the crisp air of a late January morning, people from all corners of the nation gathered on the National Mall, eagerly awaiting the inaugural ceremonies as they pondered whether this new administration would be one of stability or chaos. Senators, bureaucrats, lobbyists, and anyone in Washington who mattered—or paid enough to matter—beelined to the Capitol, their overcoats brushed with snowflakes and chilled by the morning breeze. The Secret Service kept its presence ubiquitous as it combed through buildings and shut down the streets and sidewalks bit by bit, carefully bracing for any event that would rock the nation to its core. Soon, a new president would take the reins of power at the beating heart of American democracy, and the eyes of the watching world were trained on the nation’s capital for his arrival.

In the Blair House, President-elect Tom Anderson had already been awake for three hours. Normally, he would be reclined on his visibly-used leather chair as he sipped coffee and watched the morning news. By this time, he might have already enjoyed a bagel or a plate of scrambled eggs, but he was too distracted by reflections of his past and thoughts of what was to come. As he threw on his black wool coat and stepped out of his bedroom, the President-elect’s memories turned to Wisconsin. After representing his home state in the Senate for 26 years, his life there was like a long lost dream. Fond memories of his childhood in the outskirts of Kenosha floated in his mind, though Washington made him into the man that built his reputation as a doer and won him the trust of the American people.",1,1748031014.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False

1ktt7yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1ktt7yq/grieving_for_a_friend/,Grieving for a friend,"so about 3 weeks ago now my internet friend who i’ve known for 5 years informed me their brother passed away. I was in absolute shock and devastated about the news and kept asking my self “what if they didn’t get that phone call” - “what if he never died that day” i felt the energy shift and things didn’t feel the same. the second i saw my friend cry on call that was it. Everything around me went muffled, everyone and everything was in slow motion and i just started crying. Crying like he was my brother. But he’s not, I’ve only spoken to him once. But i guess my body reacted like that because i knew how much this was going to affect her…

But since then nothing feels the same, every time she posts it doesn’t feel like her, i can tell she’s not doing okay but shes acting like it is. I can just tell by her voice she lost her world…The things she’s going through i know it’s because she’s grieving over her brother. I try and support her in every way i can over online. But even then it feels like in some ways im affected by it but I don’t know why. It genuinely felt like the world has stopped for me, nothing feels the same. Grabbing a coffee, having a laugh, just living in general just feels so off and so…wrong..if that makes sense? the world seemed so much brighter before he went but now it seems so dull…the colours seems dull. Everyone always seems like they’re in slow motion…time is always going so slow..

What’s weird, i was laying in bed 2 days ago, i had a army jacket hanging up on my coat hanger it weighs more than 2 kilos quite a heavy jacket, i havent touched the coat in over 4 months, it hasnt moved from the spot. I was on call with my friend, she was giving me updates about her brother’s funeral and family drama…All the sudden it fell, which was weird because he was in the military. And out of all the jackets what could of fell it was the army jacket…Then it felt like someone was in the room with me, i kept saying “it cant be him, i only spoke to him once..”

i told my friend, she immediately said the second i started talking about it she immediately knew it was her brother, she genuinely believed he was giving me a sign. Then she told me how she feels like he’s been giving her signs and helping her, but she said whenever she tried telling someone they thought she was crazy. But i fully understood, i felt it, i knew someone was there standing by that door…I kept asking why me out of all the people. My friend said she thinks its because im the only person who’s supporting her and validating her, her family has been nothing but horrible and been taking this entire thing out on her. So could it be? 

If it was him, he definitely wasn’t there to say hello, it was definitely to give a message to her..my friend..his younger sister and a warning because i had a wave of intense anxiety, heavy and i mean extremely heavy feeling in my chest, overwhelming, feeling of regret and just on edge with a headache, but the second i told my friend what was happening it all went away…

do you guys think this was him giving me a sign? if so i wonder why he came to me..I just want to know why im grieving for someone i’ve spoken too once.  ",1,1748030855.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False
1ktt6kq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatholicDating/comments/1ktt6kq/cant_let_go_and_let_god/,Can't let go and let God,"**TL;DR: Don't know if the end of my relationship is me being rescued or punished, and so can't move on, can't truly and fully abandon the matter to God. (But there's a bit more to it.)**

Longer version (text wall):

**Context (skip if too long):**

I (42M) was seeing this woman (35F) from early January to early April. In some ways, we had a great connection; we also had our own incompatibilities and other mutual concerns.

At first, she more than returned my pursuit of her, and I struggled to keep up due to it being so fast and my doubts about her. Later — after getting rejected made me realize the feelings I had for her and my desire to act on them — the table turned.

I won't give you the full story (you could look up my post history), but it seems that she was, or she came with, everything I needed in life and — without knowing it — everything I wanted. An impossibly great gift from God unexpectedly answering all my prayers and setting my life straight (while coinciding with the end of her own self-imposed time window to find a husband, because she was dating to marry, not to date), although coming with some sacrifices and some work, starting with a decision to accept her with some of her quirks and failings. Except I was too slow. I believe I was to be the same to her, but also failed.

After her first rejection of me, and after an abundance of prayers from friends, strangers, priests and nuns, I got a limited second chance and promised to make some changes in my life, and didn't live up to the expectations, largely due to getting confused about how limited that second chance was compared to what we had before, also due to my anxious responses to her behaviour towards me, which was perhaps stemming from a broken heart after the initial disappointment in me, but there were other reasons (meddling advice) and perhaps even *other reasons* (some signs of another man later on but not conclusive).

… And the more anxious and clingy or pushy I got, the more avoidant or hostile she did, and clammed up more, acting detached, cool, aloof, dry, even sometimes a polite type of rude, or actually rude, perhaps even cruel or lacking in empathy, or demonstratively disrespectful (but perhaps I was too quick to assume that). Things she said ran like daggers through my heart, but perhaps my heart was too entitled and they were needed to put/keep me in my place. She seemed to reduce contact (both frequency and footing), but that may be because she wanted to take things more slowly or really lacked the time or space (though her claims didn't fully add up). The more she did that, of course the more anxious I became, and the loop closed.

Demotivated and demoralized, increasingly adversarial, distrustful and focused on myself, I didn't have the good sense to change my approach (earn respect instead of demanding it; ask what I could do to make her feel better, safer, more loved), despite my earlier resolution to put up with everything for the sake of love and to endure the initial hardship and moments of verbal or emotional abuse and get her back to her January self over time. There was very little warmth or kindness coming from me at times due to the adversarial dynamic.

I spent a lot of time analysing and fighting/resisting all the slowdowns and demotions and cooldowns she was imposing (and apparently acting as if nothing was changing), instead of doing some proactive and collaborative relationship/closeness/intimacy building like I should have (although she wasn't making it easy; she was unresponsive to my efforts and quick to withdraw from hers).

I also focused on her so much that my other areas of life suffered, which had a mental toll and affected my behaviour (emotional regulation, mood, etc.) towards her, leading to blunders, even problems with boundaries, which made her lose trust in me. One blunder was that focusing so much on her, I forgot to really *focus on her* (as opposed to my needs and wants). And forgot to do the things I'd promised to do, e.g. fix some aspects of my life situation and see a therapist about certain behaviours. (Not to mention show kindness, appreciation, admiration, gratitude, etc. — only desire to be with her and dissatisfaction with her withdrawals.)

After the allotted time ran out, I got rejected again (semi-expected but still a blindside), in a very categorical way, although she wasn't deleting my numer. Days later, she didn't return my Easter wishes. After a month of no contact, she blocked me on Facebook for reaching out and asking how she was. I am probably not blocked on the phone but still redirected to voicemail.

**Problem:**

**Now, I can't just let go** like any other woman I fancied but got rejected by. There's too much of the spiritual angle and emotional investment. I associate everything, down to coffee and trees and grass, with her.

I don't have the stomach to do the 'Jesus, You Take Over' thing — I tried but the result felt scary.

Based on her behaviour and their interpretations of it, a lot of my friends and sympathetic strangers — even a wise priest, a nun, and a marriage therapist — say I dodged a bullet. (But that feels like an easy cop-out.)

However, a minority disagree. Some say it was a mutual blunder, or mutual incompatibility, and a very narrow minority lay most of the blame with my anxieties and blunders.

Myself, I don't know, but I fear *she* may be the one dodging the bullet here:

(a) **Yes, it's possible I show signs of a victim of gaslighting and narcissistic abuse**, and trauma bonding, (maybe also bonding over her trauma that we talked about, maybe lovebombing/future-faking/floodlighting, depending on how honest or stable she was at various times), **making up excuses for her unacceptable behaviour and idealizing her personality and character while devaluing myself**.

(b) But, it's also possible that I'm the bully here and the negatives about her are the product of **my entitlement, anxieties, overanalysis, overthinking**, etc. leading to a form of devaluation of my victim, or that her treatment of me was caused by the recent heartbreak/trauma inflicted by me, and that her accusatory impressions of me (e.g. using gifts to compel gratitude or a ring to force a decision) were as factually true as they were offensive to me. Either way, I immaturely sabotaged and wasted what looked like God's best gift to me and a decent one to her — a most lamentable thing to do.

Can't tell which one is the case, and can't move on with this uncertainty. Don't know if I'm being rescued or punished (or just taught a lesson).

\*\*\*

**Further reflection:**

Part of me wants to believe the failure of this relationship is a misunderstanding that can still be clarified — something I should have made a real effort to do before the time ran out; a failure I can't forgive myself for — but there doesn't seem to be a way of clarifying it any more. I do pray for her to get back in touch with me (at least to talk as friends if we truly are incompatible romantically), but you know how it is with such prayers.

When I tried the 'Jesus, You Take Over' prayer — with Our Lord's longer explanation about just how much abandonment was asked — I had a very disturbing feeling of emptiness in my heart, as if I'd never truly loved her, wasting a good and holy woman's time and putting her through much suffering while claiming to love her but in reality using her for my emotional needs, where she had first loved me and, after losing that, later at least honestly cared and hoped to regain it (while gradually losing interest or hope in me in the course of a wheedled second chance). So, killed an honest girl's love and used her. A most horrible crime.

… This would imply dishonesty, delusion, empty promises and generally being a lousy person on my part, very much someone to protect her from. In January, at the time of the first rejection, I even had a dream of her being freed from me and recovering happiness and joy in life. A sincere confession can spare me from facing this possibility for the first time during the Last Judgment. But I'm reluctant to accept this as true while the possibility exists that it could be wrong.

So, God knows better, of course. We should trust Him and His guiding hand. But I don't know if this is God protecting her, or protecting me, or just letting things run their natural course. I don't know what to trust.

Some people say God wouldn't abandon things to their natural course after so much prayer from so many people, but maybe He did so during the last week of the relationship, when I couldn't stop my impulsive complaining, even as her attitude to me showed partial improvement, and when there was a bit of trouble with physical boundaries due to me being clingy and touch-starved?

… Or perhaps He judged me unworthy and removed me from the situation like snuffing a candle because too much was too much for the poor girl?

… Or He saved me from something bad down the road (while I mostly didn't ask to be saved)?

**I'd rather not be acting like 'Oh, sure, God is saving me from a bad fate' to find out (at the Last Judgment) that I was the bad fate she was saved from. And I'd rather not be cudgeling myself with guilt if God removed her from my life for my protection, not punishment.**

Perhaps God is trying to tell me which one is the case but I'm not listening.

And I can't get over the stupid loss of His gift, if that's what it was. His goodness exceeds our imagination, but I can't imagine her

I could pray for her to come back to me — and this is the advice of a priest who has supported me from early on, even blessing the apology flowers in February — but I shudder at the thought of praying for something like this for how long? — half a year? one year? two years? — without any guarantee, and losing my chance of happiness with someone else in the meantime.

… Whereas moving on and looking for another girl would seem to confirm that this was no love, only me being irresponsible.

I can't really abandon the matter completely to God while being open to dating other women.

While many Connecticut-wrapped sticks lean mild and linear, the Brûlé brings depth, texture, and a quiet complexity that elevates it far beyond your averageg smoke. It’s soft-spoken but smart - like a conversation you actually want to linger in.

I lit one up on a calm afternoon, cappuccino in hand and sun in my face. It felt like the perfect setup for what this cigar promises: comfort, elegance and a little surprise beneath the surface.


Presentation & Cold Draw

Right out of the cellophane, the Ecuadorian Connecticut Shade wrapper looked pristine—silky smooth, with a light golden hue and minimal veins. It’s got that well dressed feel: understated, elegant, and quietly confident. The construction was firm and consistent, and the triple cap was flawlessly applied.

On the cold draw, I got soft notes of sweet cream, cedar, hay, and a touch of vanilla. There was a delicate graham cracker-like sweetness in the background that hinted at the cigar’s signature subtle charm.


First Third – Creamy & Comforting

From the first puff, the Brûlé Robusto offered up silky smoke and mellow flavors—think buttered toast, cedar and sweet cream. It’s smooth and clean, but never bland. There’s a natural, almost honeyed sweetness that gives the flavor profile some quiet richness, like vanilla shortbread or light caramel.

The retrohale had a whisper of white pepper and floral spice—enough to keep the palate awake without shaking things up too much. Burn was sharp, the ash held steady, and the cigar performed effortlessly from the start.

Second Third – Balanced & Beautifully Layered

Moving into the heart of the cigar, the profile deepened slightly. The creaminess was still front and center, but now joined by toasted almonds, vanilla and a touch of light cinnamon. The pepper backed off even more, and the smoke became thicker, with a slightly more buttery mouthfeel.

This is where the Brûlé shines—not in big shifts or bold punches, but in the way it unfolds gracefully, layer by layer. Mild to medium in body, but full in personality.


Final Third – A Soft, Satisfying Finish

As the cigar wound down, the sweetness faded into a more toasty, nut-forward profile, with notes of cashew, cedar, and faint marshmallow. There was a little more woodiness and a touch of pepper returning on the retrohale, giving the finish a balanced, refined edge. Burn line throughout remained sharp and the ash held on strong. 

No bitterness. No harsh turns. Just a slow, mellow close to an elegant ride.


Final Thoughts

The Sobremesa Brûlé Robusto is a cigar for those who appreciate nuance. It’s creamy, smooth, and easygoing, but with enough depth to keep even seasoned smokers interested. Whether you’re pairing it with a morning coffee or enjoying a laid-back afternoon smoke, it delivers a polished, consistent experience every time.

With a smoke time of 65–75 minutes, the Robusto is ideal for when you want something rewarding but not too long. Would I smoke it again? Absolutely. It’s a gentle reminder that mellow doesn’t have to mean boring—and in the right hands, it can be something truly memorable.",1,1748030737.0,cigar,0,1.0,False

The waiter glanced at the tip, then back at me, eyebrows raised, like I’d forgotten my manners. And it only gets worse, The bill already included a 12.5% service charge, so I figured I was covered. Nope, apparently that counts for nothing without extra on top.
 Is it just me or is just the norm now adays In pubs, you’re expected to chuck a quid in the jar for your pie and pint. A quid!
In cafes, it’s standard to round your flat white up to the next pound (so a £3.58 coffee becomes £4). Taxis and takeaways? Pull out your wallet and you can practically hear “Nothing for me?” in the air.

What’s the “right” amount now to tip 20%? 25%? Or should I just pretend tipping doesn’t exist and risk the side-eye?

So tell me: what are you actually tipping these days without feeling like a cheapskate… or a prat?

1ktt0o6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SacredSpirithood/comments/1ktt0o6/because_my_psychic_dad_said_so/,Because My Psychic Dad Said So,"Hey sweet spirits,

Let’s talk boundaries. Not the “you’re grounded” kind (although… watch your tone), but the kind that keep your spirit, your time, and your peace protected.

As someone who has accidentally adopted half the internet, let me be clear: I love being a dad in this space. Whether it’s offering readings, holding space, or just reminding you that you’re not broken, it’s one of the most sacred roles I’ve ever stepped into.

But even dads need boundaries.

A good dad teaches you how to trust yourself. How to protect your energy. How to walk away when something doesn’t feel right. And most of all, how to say **no,** not because you’re being mean, but because you *matter too*.

So let me say this as your Internet Dad:  
If someone sets a boundary, honor it. If you set one, hold it. You don’t owe anyone 24/7 access to your spirit just because they “really need you right now.” Your value is not measured by how many people you let drain you.

Yes, we care. Yes, we want to help. Yes, we see your hurt.  
But baby, **you can't heal the world if you’re too tired to get out of bed.**

Sometimes being a healer means answering the call.  
Other times it means putting your phone on Do Not Disturb and eating pasta in the dark.

Both are holy.

And if someone pushes your boundary and then tries to guilt you with “I thought you were spiritual,” remind them that Jesus flipped a table, St. Martha had a dragon, and I’ve blocked more people than I can count—**in love**.

Boundaries are not rejection. They are *reverence*.

Protect your peace. Guard your energy. And if anyone questions it, just say,  
“Because my psychic dad said so.”

Love always,  
**Gay 4 Tarot**

I was on Tinder, you know, just swiping away while binging some Netflix. You know how it goes... Anyway, I come across this guy who seemed pretty cute in his pics, but like... there was something kinda off. Yet, I was like, YOLO, right? 

We matched and started chatting, and I gotta say, he was pretty funny. We decided to meet up for coffee. Big surprise when I get there, he's not exactly what his profile pictured him as 🙈. But hey, I was already there, so I figured I'd enjoy the day anyway.

Turns out, we had the best time just talking and laughing about everything – from how hilarious his photo editing skills were to the chaos of online dating. By the end of it, it was clear there wasn't any romantic spark, but we both felt like we wanted to hang out again.

Fast forward a few months, and he's now one of my closest friends. Seriously, we hang out all the time, and I couldn't imagine not having him in my life. Who would've thought I'd make a real friend on Tinder of all places? 😂 Life is full of weird surprises, tbh... and I wouldn't have it any other way! 🥰",5,1748030130.0,swipeTales,0,1.0,False

- He picked me up and drove me home
- I payed for my own drink
- He mentioned how he was nervous and haven’t talked to anyone since his ex(i wanted to ask more about his ex but i was scared and felt like it would be too soon to ask since we’ve been only taking for 2 weeks)
- We put eachother on on music! he likes heavy stuff and i like soft music but i’m very versatile 
- He greeted me with a hug
- He mentioned that he isn’t much of a talker( i’m a introvert)
- We only have a few things in common 
-He’s extremely attractive and i’m praying he likes me

**Laptop Compartment:** This is arguably the most critical feature of any laptop backpack designed for work. A dedicated, padded compartment ensures that your laptop is securely protected from bumps and scratches during transit. Look for backpacks that can accommodate laptops of different sizes, typically ranging from 13 inches to 17 inches or more. The compartment should be easily accessible,allowing for speedy removal and replacement of the laptop without disrupting other items in the bag.

A laptop compartment should feature ample padding on all sides, including the bottom, to cushion the device from impact. some premium backpacks incorporate additional security features such as a suspended laptop sleeve, which elevates the laptop slightly above the bottom of the compartment, further protecting it from drops.The compartment may also include a secure closure mechanism, such as a zipper or a Velcro strap, to keep the laptop firmly in place.**Organizational Pockets:** A well-organized backpack is essential for maximizing efficiency and productivity. Multiple internal and external pockets allow you to seperate and store various items, keeping them readily accessible. Look for pockets designed to hold specific items such as tablets, smartphones, pens, business cards, and water bottles. A dedicated tablet sleeve is notably useful for those who use tablets for work or entertainment.

Internal organizational features may include zippered mesh pockets for smaller items, elastic loops for pens, and dividers to separate documents and folders. external pockets, such as a quick-access front pocket, are ideal for storing items that you need to access frequently, such as your phone, keys, or wallet. Side pockets, often expandable, are designed to hold water bottles or umbrellas, keeping them separate from electronic devices and important documents.

**Comfort and Ergonomics:** Carrying a heavy backpack for extended periods can lead to discomfort and strain. Ergonomic design features, such as padded shoulder straps and a ventilated back panel, can significantly improve comfort and reduce the risk of injury. Shoulder straps should be adjustable to ensure a snug and comfortable fit, and the padding should be thick enough to distribute weight evenly across your shoulders.

A ventilated back panel allows air to circulate, preventing sweat buildup and keeping your back cool and dry.Some backpacks feature contoured back panels that conform to the natural curve of your spine, providing additional support and comfort. A sternum strap and a waist belt can further enhance comfort by distributing the weight of the backpack more evenly and preventing it from shifting during movement.**Durability and Materials:** A high-quality laptop backpack should be made from durable materials that can withstand the rigors of daily use. Look for backpacks made from water-resistant or waterproof fabrics such as nylon, polyester, or canvas. Reinforced stitching and durable zippers are also essential for ensuring long-lasting performance.

Nylon is a popular choice for backpacks due to its strength,water resistance,and abrasion resistance. Polyester is another common material, offering similar properties at a lower cost. Canvas is a more conventional material that is durable and stylish, but it may not be as water-resistant as synthetic fabrics. Heavy-duty zippers, such as YKK zippers, are known for their durability and reliability.

A comfortable backpack minimizes back pain,shoulder aches,and fatigue,allowing for greater focus on work-related tasks.The proper weight distribution prevents undue pressure on specific areas of the body, decreasing the risk of long-term musculoskeletal issues. The ventilated back panel also helps maintain a comfortable temperature by promoting airflow, diminishing discomfort caused by sweat buildup.

A sleek and well-maintained backpack conveys attention to detail, professionalism, and competence. This contributes to creating a favorable image when meeting with clients, attending conferences, or networking with colleagues.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions regarding laptop backpacks for work.**What size laptop backpack do I need?**
The appropriate size laptop backpack depends on the size of your laptop and the volume of other items you need to carry. Measure your laptop diagonally to determine its screen size. Most laptop backpacks are designed to accommodate laptops ranging from 13 inches to 17 inches. Consider the capacity of the backpack in liters, which indicates the overall storage volume.Select a size that comfortably fits your laptop and other essentials without being too bulky or cumbersome.

A 20-30 liter backpack is typically sufficient for daily commutes, while a 30-40 liter backpack may be necessary for overnight trips or carrying additional items such as textbooks or gym clothes. Ensure that the laptop compartment is adequately padded and secured to protect your device during transit.

**Is it better to have a backpack with one large compartment or multiple smaller compartments?**
The ideal configuration of compartments depends on your organizational preferences and the types of items you typically carry. A backpack with one large compartment offers maximum adaptability for accommodating bulky items, but it may be less organized. Multiple smaller compartments provide dedicated storage spaces for various items, making it easier to locate and access them quickly.

Consider a backpack with a combination of both large and small compartments. A large main compartment can hold books, documents, or clothing, while smaller pockets can store accessories, electronic devices, and personal items. Organizational features such as zippered mesh pockets, pen loops, and dividers can further enhance the functionality of the backpack.

**How important is water resistance for a laptop backpack?**
Water resistance is an important feature, especially if you frequently commute in rainy or wet conditions. A water-resistant backpack will protect your laptop and other belongings from moisture damage. Look for backpacks made from water-resistant materials such as nylon or polyester and featuring waterproof zippers.

Some backpacks also come with a rain cover that can be deployed in heavy rain to provide additional protection. While a water-resistant backpack may not be completely waterproof, it will provide sufficient protection for most everyday situations. Consider the level of water resistance you need based on your typical commuting conditions and the value of the items you are carrying.

But I feel that I should tell my story in case it helps someone else.

*  Month 1: got a UTI and got prescribed antibiotics. I have MS so they don't play around with infection but the doctor said, ""The test we just did is negative.""
* Month 2:  Again, I go in for a UTI. The quick test is negative again but they prescribe antibiotics. 
* Month 3: I try to see an OBGYN to see if they can help and they prescribe me antibiotics to be taken daily and refer me to a Urologist. 
* Month 4: I am fine on the daily antibiotic. 
* Month 5: The urologist walks into the room and diagnoses me with IC because all my tests for UTI are negative. I am prescribed amitriptyline too. but am still taking the daily antibiotic.
* Month 6: I see the urologist to update on how the amytryptyline is working and I tell him that I really feel like the antibiotic is what is helping. He refuses to prescribe me more daily antibiotic. A week later I am done with the daily antibiotic and the UTI symptoms are back really bad. The quick test is negative, but I INSIST they send it off to labs. In the meantime they prescribe 7 days of antibiotics. After this round is complete the symptoms are back so I call the office and tell them. A nurse condescendingly tells me that I need to quit ""eating spicy food and drinking coffee"". I patiently remind here that I am already not doing these things and that I want them to find out the culture results. She tells me they are normal.  I burst into tears once I am off the phone. This does not feel like IC. I know it's UTI. She calls me back 10 minutes later, ""I guess there was a page in your results I missed. We prescribed a 15 day course of antibiotics because this infection won't go away with the course you just did."" So I do that course and I am fine again.
* Month 7: I quit the amitriptyline, feeling certain the diagnosis is wrong. I get another UTI and I change urologists because I cannot stand him insisting I have IC. The new urologist looks through my lab culture results and says, ""I've never seen this before. We're going to run a lab culture even though your quick test is negative."" The lab results come back and they put me on the proper antibiotic.
* Month 8: I get another UTI as soon as I am done with the antibiotics. They run the quick test: negative. They run the lab test: negative. They send it off for a ""Microgen"" test. The Microgren test comes back, and it's TWO rare forms of bacteria that they have to treat with two different antibiotics at the same time. 
* Month 9: UTIs are gone, finally, and I am on a daily antibiotic and I am fine.
* Month 10: Still taking the daily antibiotic and I am fine.

Listen to your body. Don't trust the quick tests, they're ALWAYS negative for me, and yet, I had really bad bacteria present that it could not pick up. Even if the lab cultures come back negative, do the Microgen test. Sometimes we're right, we know what is wrong with our  body and they just aren't performing the right test on us. 

We think we are narrowing down the cause of these and they have been looking at my kidneys and bladder structure etc., to get to the bottom of it. But they have officially told me that I DO NOT have IC. This is recurrent UTIs and they must be treated very differently. Hoping this helps someone in a similar situation. 

Wishing you ALL doctors that believe you and care for you and trust you whether you suffer with IC or UTI or any other things. We are the experts of our own bodies.",1,1748030092.0,Interstitialcystitis,1,1.0,False

I've been taking the same route to work for years now: the same roads, the same turns, even the same parking spot if I can manage it. It's almost like I'm on autopilot. But lately, I've been wondering why I'm so fixed on this routine, especially when there's this great coffee place just a block outta my usual path. 

I was thinking, maybe it's not just about convenience, but more about the comfort and predictability it gives me. There's a certain psychological reward knowing exactly when I'll hit each stoplight or how long my podcast will last me before I'm at my desk. 

But I'm curious... could switching it up occasionally bring a fresh perspective or even some subtle happiness boosts throughout my day? 🤔 I guess breaking out of this habit might seem scary at first. But who knows, maybe there's an awesome donut shop or another little gem I haven't discovered yet. Anyone else felt this way and tried changing up their daily routes? What did ya find out?

This has been a drag since this ""situation"" happened since Girleipop came last August2024 to where I am(I'll just name her like that) She's 33 and I'm 32F.

I'm working overseas for 5yrs already and last year Girliepop asked me if I could help her out with ticket and visa cause she wanted to come where I am, I was hesitant at first but eventually decided to lend her money for it cause her reason was valid enough for me, she wanted to earn a lot more money to help her mother with medications. (It's also my main reason why I left my country in Asia to help out my mom and nieces).

She was able to arrive where I am and let her stay in my place for a month but I waited for her to start looking for jobs but she wasn't really initiating even when I already told her that she can borrow my laptop to search for jobs or anytime she needed it. What I did then was I initiated browsing through jobsites and then telling her to submit resumès to those that shows potential. She did, yet wasn't getting a call from any.

Month passed and I asked my closefriends that shared an apartment if she could stay there for awhile, they agreed if she pays 150dhs/month, and the apartment itself costs 3000dhs+ monthly. So it was already a very low rate, they only asked for such amount since Girliepop was my friend, they said, more like a discount since they're very kind and as am I to them. They also treat her sometimes since she doesnt have a job yet and when there's someone or some place looking for people to hire, we tell her immediately.
 Weeks passed as Girliepop stayed there and closefriends were complaining to me that she actually didn't really help out with chores in the apartment and her vibe was negative in a way that she was always in the room --laying and was on her phone always(this apartment has only one room but has a living and dining room) So if she was in the room, the friends hang out either dining or living room. Also she was not very active in job hunting. In short -- she was lazy, doesn't use her common sense and had no initiative. 
(In our culture if you live with others in a place where you are only crashing for awhile, it's always a manner of us to help out, volunteer for even little things like -cooking, going to the shop if needed) infact, what she did was if she was the first one to wake up, she waits on everybody before she gets up and ask one of the friends if they could also make coffee for her.

Months passed, she stayed in the apartment for 6months and still had no job, I helped her out with groceries sometimes, i buy her food and by the way, within these 6months she was always giving me attitude, she went cold, and her replies to me were sarcastic everytime I tried to have a serious conversation with her, i was trying to give her advises but she built a very high wall between us, I attempted many times to talk sense with her but she just shut me down. This attitude of hers actually started when she wanted me to teach her how to commute without even asking me or letting me know that that was what she wanted. She assumed that I could read her mind and when she said she was going to the mall and was just gonna get a taxi and I just said ""okay take care"", she was right then disappointed, cause eventually as week passed, she told me that she was expecting me to know what she wanted which was ""to go with her and learn the transportation here"" or expected me to have the iniatiative to know that that was what she wanted. Since then, she went cold, this wasnt her first time, this happened many times already before, she goes silent treatment for months and there was one time that it took her 3years to not talk to me.

In one of our fights since she came here, 
We were arguing and I told her to lower her pride (that has been her problem ever since) she told me ""How can you say my pride is high? You don't know my struggles just to get here and do you knwo why I came here? I came here for you!"" I was like puzzled and laughed at her and told her "" why would you come for me? You said you are here to find a job, remember? You said you wanted my help to get you so that you can find a job and support your mom?"" 
(Please let me know what you think about this cause until now i'm puzzled why she said that).

One time, one of the friends went home to the apartment where she was known to be the only one at the apartment for a week at that time, (takenote: she has no job still) and to my friend's surprise, the house was dirty smelly and messed up and Girliepop left it like that, so one was happy.

The last straw: We gave her an ultimatum, she can't stay in the apartment if she still doesnt follow the simple rules in the apartment ""maintain cleanliness"", if she still wants to stay, she has to follow 
The rules, yet she chose to leave and spend more than 150 dhs and got her a bedspace somewhere. 

When she left, I didnt speak to her again,but I sometimes feel guilty because she might just be depressed and homesick but that's already what is expected when you go abroad and you just have to suck it up and be strong and positive. She also said we were toxic, but I feel that she was the one who was toxic. Sometimes though i asked myself if i did the right thing to decide not to speak to her again like really cutting her off in my life,  knowing im the only one that she really  trusted here.

# Prologue

Late May after the regular exams have ended and one month since the revival of the literature club due to the temporary suspension being lifted from the events of Volume 7. Tiara comes into the library to checkout a book but also wants to talk to Kazu about something.

# Chapter 1

Tiara wants Kazu to be her endorser for the upcoming student council presidency race. The teachers have requested that there has to be atleast one male president or vice president to fill the new student council roles due to the current roles being both women as they worry that if the student council members were of one gender, it would be harder for students to consult with them. Sakurai also doesn’t want to continue with the student council so there was no other male student that Tiara could ask. Kazu initially refuses and tries to avoid Tiara as much as possible, but she shows up at his house due to Kaju. Nothing comes of this, but Tiara is adamant to get Kazu to be her endorser, going so far to “offer” a store display pop of “Chikapyon”; Kazu’s favourite character from one of his favourite anime’s. To get Kazu to agree, she initially offers the pop for a simple study session with him as her grades have been falling. 



He agrees and they initially meet at the Bookstore in front of Tokoyashi Station. Eventually Tiara leads Kazu to her house where she reveals that both her parents are out and only her little brother is at home. During the study session, Tiara reveals that the deadline for running for president has passed and she was the only candidate. Kazu feels relief that he doesn’t have to give a campaign speech. Tiara then goes on to say that she had a secret weapon besides the pop figure to convince Kazu to be her endorser. All of a sudden she pulls out a pair of cat ears and meows for Kazu in an attempt to seduce him. (She’s just showing him what she would have done to make Kazu endorse her). Suddenly, her brother opens the door wanting to tell her that he’s going out but walks in on Tiara meowing for Kazu in cat ears. Tiara’s younger brother introduces himself then dips leaving Tiara completely embarrassed. Kazu helps calm her down by making up some stuff suggesting her younger brother didn’t see or hear the events that just took place. Moments later, a teacher calls Tiara telling her that someone submitted their candidacy for student council president last minute and there will be an election. This sends Tiara in a state of panic revealing the one who submitted the application to be none other than Sakurai Hiroto. Once again, Tiara begs Kazu in the pose of a cat to help fight for her during the election.

Some Other Events that happened in Chapter 1:

* Sakurai and Kazu are in the cooking club room. A female student asks Sakurai to come over to her place, but he refuses. Some junior girls then ask Sakurai to taste test some food they made for him. Kazu in his mind realizes how popular Sakurai is with girls.
* While at the Nukumizu house, Kaju teaches Tiara to make a small dish which is a family recipe.
* Lemon also shows up at his place to take a shower.
* Kazu promises Komari that he won’t join the student council.
* There’s a scene of Kazu and Shikaya hiding from Tiara and spot her doing her makeup. She spots them, scolds them for not saying anything and Shikaya starts rubbing her cheeks with Tiara and starts touching her.
* Kazu deletes Chihaya contacts from Kaju’s phone fearing that she’d be a bad influence on his little sister
* While meeting at the Bookstore in front of Toyohashi Station for Tiara, Kazu bumps into Anna and Riko who are on their way to a free dessert buffet. Riko mentions that she exchanged contact info with Kaju which catches Kazu off guard. She also reveals that Kaju was the one that let the meeting place slip.
* On their way to Tiara’s house, they see one of Tiara’s neighbours who’s a middle aged woman. She remarks on how Tiara has grown up.
* Right when Tiara’s little brother dips, there’s a moment that Kazu reiterates that he’s not interested in the same sex which Tiara states that she knows that and she’s grown passed that phase where she couldn’t tell the difference between delusion and reality.

# Intermission 1

In the student council room we see Hibari wiping down her desk. Sakurai responds  that she’s getting ahead of herself as there’s still one month left in her term. Hibari responds that she doesn’t like scrambling to clean up last minute and respect is built over time. They both reminisce of their time spent in the student council and the memories they made along the way. Hibari then hands Sakurai a folder with the summary of pending issues, one in particular that she warns him about are the supplementary budget meetings which could get a little messy. Sakurai refuses the folder and reminds Hibari that he’s not staying in the student council anymore. Hibari then apologizes calling it a habit and says she felt that he would be the one to take over as student council president. She then reaches for the bucket handle used to clean her desk and it detaches, Sakurai reaches out but Hibari catches the bucket rim with her free hand. Hibari grins saying that she can take care of herself. Sakurai asks for the file from earlier as if he made a decision.

# Chapter 2

It’s the start of the week and classes are almost over with just homeroom class left. Ms. Amanatsu goes on a rant about 28 being the prime age to get married and is seemingly angry that she is still single at the age of 28. After class is over, the door burst open and it’s Tiara who drops a stack of paper at Kazu’s desk. This causes a scene; Anna, Komari and Karen stare suspiciously at what just took place. Ms. Amanatsu is also taking pictures of Kazu for some reason. Due to the staring eyes, Tiara agrees to take this conversation to somewhere more private; the courtyard of Tsuwabuki High.(It was not more private) There were still several students who walked past that gave both Tiara and Kazu puzzled looks. Tiara really wants Kazu to help her with the election, but due to Literature club duties, Kazu refuses to get too deeply involved so she backs off a bit. Kazu reaffirms that he still won’t be her endorser but will help out until she can find someone to take his place. Suddenly Riko comes out of nowhere and ask if Tiara wants some tea….she also reveals that Anna has become Sakurai’s endorser.

During practice for the sports festival, Kazu talks to Anna about being Sakurai’s endorser. Anna reveals that she aims to be vice president so she would have the power to install a Kitchen in the Literature club room. Kazu responds that being in the student council doesn’t have that much authority. Anna then talks to Kazu about going to Tiara’s house and if he fell for her seduction which he responds he was there for some anime merchandise. Anna then tells Kazu, “Let’s fight fair and square”.

Two days later, the election campaign has officially began. Tiara and Kazu plan to go club to club to listen to each of their requests. Tiara plans to talk to the captain of the basketball team. At the gym, they see Anna and Sakurai already there campaigning. Sakurai apologizes to Kazu for lying about not participating in the elections. And also reveals that they were turned down by the boy’s basketball team.(Anna rejected the former captain of the boys basketball team last year during the third year’s graduation). Tiara returns and says they have a lot more work to do and not to disturb the clubs any longer.

Kazu once again reassures Komari that he has no plans to join the student council. Komari ask Kazu if he’s free on Saturday to which Kazu responds that he is. When they meet, Kazu sees Komari with her two younger siblings; Susumu and Hina(Susumu is in 4th grade while Hina is about 4 years old). Komari’s parents both had work so she had to babysit them. They play some games, eat some food and Susumu buys something for his little sister. During the bus ride home, both of the little kids are asleep and Komari thanks Kazu for today. They start talking about Tiara coming over to his place….after they get off the bus, Susumu seemingly overheard their conversation and slaps Kazu calling him a blockhead.

The next week, Kazu and Tiara begin discussing what to do. When Komari texts Kazu to immediately come to the second year classroom hallway. When they both arrive, they see the Tsuwubaki Newspaper with the headline “Student Council election is actually a proxy war for love”. It talks about how there is a “woman’s enemy” with multiple female love interests. Kazu thinks this “woman’s enemy” in the new article is referring to Sakurai but Tiara starts freaking out and blaming Kazu. (Kazu thinks the “woman’s enemy boy” is Sakurai but the article is referring to Kazu)

Some Other events that happened in Chapter 2:

* During practice for the sports festival, Kazu spots Sakurai chatting with a group of girls in their class - in his mind he believes Sakurai is really popular
* He also talks to Mitsuki during practice for the sports festival as Mitsuki thinks that he’s fallen for someone because of the scene with Tiara barging into his homeroom
* At the gym while campaigning, they see a girl with a camera. It’s revealed that the birdwatching club is part of the newspaper club now. In this same scene, Kazu unconsciously stares at Anna with her asking if there was something on her face
* In the newspaper article, it talks about how the “woman’s enemy” boy stole Ako(Anna) from the former basketball club captain who had graduated and toyed with her before dumping her

# Intermission 2

At the cafe Uno Uno in of Toyohasi Station, Anna and Karen start discussing about the Student Council election. Karen ask why Anna decided to become Sakurai’s endorser, she responds that its due to Kazu being courted by Tiara. Anna thinks it’s a win-win scenario, because if they win, she thinks she’s doing them a favour and if she wins, she gets her pick of university recommendations. They then talk about the school newspaper article. Anna seems really upset that the article talks about how Kazu and her supposedly dated, and she was the one that got dumped(she wanted to be the one that did the dumping). But she also agrees the article isn’t far off as it calls Kazu the enemy of all women. Karen then ask her if she and Kazu are dating to which she responds that she didn't date him back then and is not dating him now either\*. Karen then ask if she’s worried if this situation would push them closer together to which Anna responds she isn’t worried believing Tiara to be too uptight. Suddenly Anna drops her phone and becomes all pale. Karen picks it up and sees an article of how “Student A” lost all her glory to “Student K” and if she can reclaim it in the upcoming student election. Karen realizes the article is talking about the two of them, told her not to worry about it and offered to treat her to food. This returns her back to normal.

\*The MTLs mistranslated this part when Karen asks Anna if she and Kazu are dating as it has Anna saying ""Never have, Never will"" in response, the actual Japanese translations did not having her say something so direct.

# Chapter 3

A week has passed, Both Tiara and Sakurai are focused on preparations for the student council’s final job - the sports festival. On Sunday, Anna, Komari and Kazu take a train and subway to a large athletic stadium in Nagoya. They are there to watch Lemon compete to qualify for Nationals. Lemon has already passed this morning 1500m prelims with the fastest time. A top 6 finish in the finals would qualify her for Nationals. Koto and Tamaki also show up to cheer on Lemon. Riko suddenly appears and greets the two seniors, going so far to hold Tamaki’s hand which causes him to break into a grin. Koto steps in between the two, but before Koto can say anything about what just happened, Riko compliments her for being as beautiful as the rumours say. Koto stands there completely frozen. The 1500m finals begins, Kazu reminisces on the time Lemon tells him that she’s going to win Nationals(in the nurses office in Vol 6). Lemon wins with a ten second gap to the runner up. Komari gets overwhelmed with excitement and almost hugs Kazu but instead hugs Anna. Riko spreads her arms wide open, but Koto drags her away(In Kazu’s mind he believes that’s how she dealt with everyone after Tamaki). Kazu also sees Mitsuki crying and dabbing his eyes with a handkerchief in front of Chihaya. With this victory, Lemon secures a place at Nationals.

The next day, Kazu sees Sakurai’s election poster in the hallway and realizes that there wasn’t any Tiara posters there. Suddenly he receives a text from Tiara to meet her at the usual place(the courtyard). During the meetup, Tiara appears cosplaying as Chikapyon(the season 2 version of Kazu’s favourite character from one of his favourite anime). Tiara is extremely embarrassed while Kazu stands there completely speechless. Tiara then ask “Didn’t you like this character”. Suddenly the newspaper club girl carrying the camera tells Tiara that she’s hasn’t taken her election poster photo yet. Tiara did take one but not in the last 3 months, so she had to take another one. The newspaper club girl drags her off to take the election poster photo in that Chikapyon outfit. Her poster photo consists of Tiara striking the Chikapyon pose twirling her index fingers in front of her.

Kazu takes Tiara to a small coffee shop as she requested she wanted to get away from school. Tiara once again asks Kazu to become her endorser with Kazu replying “why me”. Tiara talks about how stubborn she can be at times often butting head with others and why she wants to win so she can continue being with everyone in the student council as a friend. She also believes that Hibari and the others on the student council care about Kazu very much and that he has something that she doesn’t have. She ask Kazu to support her and only her, but Kazu doesn’t give a proper response.

A previous survey is done and Sakurai is leading by 45% of total votes, Tiara at 30% and 25% are undecided. Sakurai has strong support from 1st and 3rd year girls, and 2nd year boys. While Tiara was doing well with 1st year boys. Kazu brings up the school newspaper article about the “enemy of women” still thinking it’s Sakurai, Tiara breaks the news to him that the “enemy of women” is actually referring to himself to his shock. Now rereading the article knowing it’s about him, he’s able to deduce that Ako is referring to Anna and agrees that some parts of the articles are true. The results of the latest poll are out, this is after Tiara’s cosplay photos were released to the public. Sakurai is up to 50% and Tiara made a 15% spike to 45%, with 5% of voters still undecided. It’s revealed that Tiara has gained a lot of support among male voters while her female support has gone down. Kazu think that her outfit was a success. They both come to the realization that even if she gets the 5% of remaining voters, she would only tie Sakurai, to win, she must cut into his support base. Now with the polling so close, Tiara ask Kazu to be her endorser and that he doesn’t need to join the student council, but just lend her his strength to win the election. Kazu realizing that if Anna becomes Vice President, Komari writing speed slowing down and the literature club already having so few members, it would be bad if the Literature club gets less help due to Anna being focused on her VP duties. So Kazu finally agrees to be Tiara’s endorser, on ONE condition, that she wears the same outfit as the photo on the election poster. Kazu’s plan is to cut into Sakurai’s male support base as he suggests that even though Sakurai is cute, it doesn’t exactly translate to support from the male voter base. If Tiara were to cosplay as Chikapyon, it would lock in some of those male votes. Tiara agrees to give her speech in the Chikapyon outfit which fulfils Kazu’s condition on becoming Tiara’s official endorser.

Back at home, Kazu plans to start drafting a support speech. Kaju enters his room and ask Kazu if he plans on joining the student council. He says he doesn’t plan to but is also shocked that she found out about this. To which she responds “I know everything about you, big brother”. Kaju is working hard to get into Tsuwubaki and has been studying so hard that she doesn’t show up much to his highschool anymore. Kaju rolls around in his bed while Kazu starts finishing up his draft for his speech. Twenty minutes has passed and he realizes that Kaju is being awfully quiet but realizes she fell asleep in his bed hugging a pillow. Kazu puts a blanket over Kaju and walks over to the window to close the half open curtain, but he sees a dark figure drifting in front of his house. It turns out to be Shikaya whose phone is out of battery and she wants to borrow a charger. Kazu walks Shikaya to the tram stop, Shikaya was about to step into the crosswalk on a red light, Kazu grabs her and yanks her back causing her to fall forward into his chest. They stay in that position for a bit till Shikaya lightly punches Kazu in the chest before crossing the street. Halfway across she turns around and mutters “Enemy of women”.

The morning of the election has arrived and Kazu is going over his speech. He’s getting really nervous and is beginning to have second doubts, to calm his nerves he begins to look towards the sports field where the track team is practicing. Anna meets up with him and shoves a pork cutlet sandwich in his face. Kazu asks if she’s ok with speaking in front of that many people when she gives her support speech for Sakurai to which she responds that she pretends that the audience are vegetables. Anna then hands Kazu a Katsu sandwich and comments that he needs a little more meat on his bones. Kazu tells her to give it to Sakurai. This causes Anna to smile and accuses Kazu about being jealous because she’s getting along with Sakurai. They go back and forth and Kazu denies that he’s jealous multiple times. But he does come to the realization that Anna is right about something that “when someone is always by your side, It’s easy to take things for granted”. Anna nods in agreement and says she’s been there. Kazu leads her on a bit, but then suddenly starts talking about Tiara. Anna gets angry and kicks him in the leg then leaves. Kazu follows after her but bumps into Tiara. Tiara and Anna agree to do their best.

Everyone is now gathered at the gym for the student council speeches. Anna is the first to begin. Her whole speech revolves around food comparing Sakurai to white rice and that rice welcomes any side dish with warmth and acceptance. She starts making several food analogies in her speech. She ends her speech with “we won’t let anyone go hungry and to make Sakurai into a freshly cooked bowl of rice for us all”. The crowd was visibly confused but applauded Anna’s intensity.

Sakurai is next to give his speech and he begins talking about how he is a supporting member who assist everyone behind the scenes. He then further talks about the student council accomplishments are and what they have done this year. It cuts back to Tiara and Kazu who are panicking with how honest Sakurai is in his speech. They did not expect him to take this approach and now it looks like if Tiara repeats the same points, it would look like she was stealing credit since she was speaking second. They suddenly change their plans of a scripted speech and decide to free talk. Sakurai finishes his speech and now it’s Kazu turn to talk.

At the podium, he’s terrified and starts to lose confidence but he glances at Tiara looking back at him with trust and strength. It allows Kazu to give a speech from the heart, he talks about his first impression about her, her strengths and weaknesses and how she was always selflessly thinking about others. And her first selfish wish is to become student council president and that he became her supporter to fulfil this selfish wish of hers. He then goes on a rant that if anyone talks bad about her, he will praise her ten times more until morning if he had to. Tiara is in the background blushing completely red while the students sit frozen in silence. All of a sudden, Shikaya barges in and gives her own speech for Tiara. She reveals that Sakurai was actually the one to tell the student council about Tiara, not her. Sakurai is the one who recommended her to the student council and was someone he found to be earnest and full of compassion. She then goes on about her good points and finally tells everyone to vote for Tiara but also Sakurai was a cute junior and to think carefully before voting. A huge applause takes place that “shakes” the whole gym. It is now Tiara’s turn to speak. She says that she planned to talk about the student council accomplishments this past year but Sakurai has already took that spot. She opens up about her vulnerabilities about being bad at school(something she has hidden for a long time, finally revealed), not being great in sports or being great at socializing with friends. And that she finally found a place in the student council. In her closing remarks, she starts bleeding from the nose and yells “everyone here is my oshi(idol)! That’s why!”. “Please let me be the one to support all of you”. The next day, Tiara was appointed as the next student council president.

Some Other events that happened in Chapter 3:

* Kazu and Tamaki catch up while watching Lemon compete. Tamaki reveals living alone and plastering posters on walls and ceilings….even talks about body pillows as well. He also reveals his room is child’s play compared to Koto. Her room consists of half naked men staring back at you and there’s always music of BL voice drama playing in the background.
* Koto also talks to Kazu about her own experience running as vice president. Telling him how her own grades wasn’t great, she wasn’t liked by the teachers but still gave a speech to support her candidate. At the end of the conversation, she asks Kazu “What do you plan to do after the election”.
* Besides Kaju, Tiara is the first person Kazu brings to that coffee shop
* Tiara also orders coffee but also doesn’t like coffee, she only orders it to try and get used to it because Kazu likes it(to his confusion)
* It’s revealed that Lemon has secured a spot at nationals in both the 1500m and 3000m events
* During Tiara’s speech, Behind the stage, Kazu tells Sakurai “It all worked out. Thanks. He replied “you’re welcome”.

# Intermission 3

Hibari and Shikaya are in the student council room talking about the election results. Shikaya is glad that Tiara won and ask if she made it home okay. Hibari responds that Sakurai made sure to walk her home so she is fine. Hibari also questions Shikaya about why she barged in like that during the endorsement speech. Shikaya responds that she did it to break the tension as she felt things were getting too intense and apologizes for her actions. Hibari rebuffs her apology and states that she is not mad, and she was satisfied that the one with the stronger feelings won. She believes that she can trust Tiara with the student council when she graduates. It’s also revealed that Tiara asks Sakurai to be Vice President to which he accepts. They then both reminisce about the past and said it was fun. The current student council will disband after the upcoming sports festival and will be handed over to the next council.

# Chapter 4

The day of the sports festival begins. Kazu competes in a mandatory sprint, unfortunately he was put in a group with 5 other people that consists of members from the track tream and Sosuke. Sosuke took 1st place while Kazu came in dead last. Kazu and Mitsuki then watch a relay race that Lemon is participating in, they start to argue on who knows Lemon the best proceeding to one-up each other. Lemon then blazes passed the finish line holding up her index finger. Kazu and Mitsuki argue on who she was signalling too. Chihaya overhears this and drags Mitsuki away seemingly to have a ""talk"" with him.

Kazu comes across Anna who asks for his lunch which he refuses to give. He instead offers to buy the bread for her(if she pays him in advance which she agrees) as she is occupied with a bread eating race(Kazu doesn't believe the bread from the race is enough to make her full so he goes to buy even more bread for her). On his way back from the school store with his hands full of bread, he encounters Riko in an animal costume for the cheer battle who promises to give him a signal when she's dancing. During lunch break, he's with Komari, they chat a bit before Karen in her cheerleader outfit asks Komari to perform in the cheer battle as a girl Komari's size got hurt so they need a replacement. During the cheer battle, Kazu makes a mental note on Karen's breast size and her radiant aura. Also stares at Anna's squishy belly surprised that it wasn't all that noticable. Komari also gets lifted up in the air and starts screaming.

Kazu gets hurt in the obstacle race, Sakurai is at the first aid station to help bandage him up. Kazu takes this oppurtunity to ask Sakurai on why he recommended Tiara to the student council. Sakurai says that the reason he recommended her was that a group of students started nasty rumours about her, but when the same group's leader got in trouble, only Tiara stood up for them. Sakurai saw those good qualities in her so he recommended her to the others. Tiara comes by while Sakurai goes to prepare for the closing ceremony.

Tiara asks Kazu to watch her in the borrowing race. A borrowing race is a game where you grab a slip of paper with an item or person written on it and go retrieve it from somewhere in the venue. Mitsuki and Chihaya are also competing in this race, the prompt on her card was glasses. Chihaya takes Mitsuki’s glasses and puts them on, she can’t see with them and Mitsuki can’t see without them. Tiara then ask Kazu to come with her, he’s wondering what the prompt on her card could be. She suddenly grabs his hand and crosses to the finish line. The female staff member needed to check the prompt on the card to verify the win, when Tiara showed her the card, the female staff member stood their eyes wide open frozen in shock. Kazu is still wondering what Tiara’s prompt was but Tiara interrupts him asking for a bit of his time after school.

Kazu believes that Tiara is going to give him the pop figure that she promised him. When they meetup, they reminisce on how they first met and how an inappropriate novel(Koto’s novel in Vol 4) got brought to school. Kazu then starts teasing her calling her Tiara multiple times and was surprised when she didn’t get mad about it. He admits that he does that to tease her. She then thanks him for everything he’s done for her and confirms that Sakurai is going to be vice president. They begin to head back home but Tiara stops him and says she forgot to tell him something important. Kazu thinks it’s the Chikapyon pop figure but it’s actually the borrowing race prompt. She hands him the slip of paper, Kazu reads it and it says “THE PERSON YOU LIKE”. Tiara then confesses to Kazu, “Nukumizu-san, I like you”. Kazu thinks it’s a misunderstanding but Tiara clarifies that it’s in a romantic way and ask him to go out with her. Kazu is in complete shock that this is happening to him. In his mind, he thinks she’s cute, way out of his league, just one word yes and the girl he’s dreamed about would be his. “He also thinks that if they dated…he knows that it will be fun…there’s no reason to say no…none…all he has to do is say yes and he will be with Tiara” But the words just won’t come out, he stays silent. Tiara breaks the silence by telling him to wait and to start off as friends. Kazu says he already thought they were friends. Tiara responds that she would love if they could talk more casually, go out sometime and eventually come to like her. Kazu says he will give it some serious thought, Tiara responds with “so you’d better fall for me sooner rather than later okay?”

Some Other events that happened in Chapter 4:

* Anna ate all the bread Kazu bought for her right before the cheer battle
* During the cheer battle, Kazu also goes to see Riko's class performance and notes that she is only interacting with the boys. She sees Kazu, smiles and blows a kiss to him as the signal she promised him right before lunch break. Kazu encounters Mr. Tanaka who also reveals that Riko called him over here to watch as she had a signal for him too.
* In the borrowing race, Kazu asks Mitsuki about how he was cheering on Lemon in the relay race which he does not remember. He also doesn’t remember being dragged off by Chihaya. Kazu wonders what Chihaya did to him.
* After the borrowing game concluded, Chihaya tells both Kazu and Tiara that her prompt was glasses, she deduces that Tiara’s prompt must have been Kazu

# Anna’s Novel

The renovations for the convenience store are finally done. Ako sits on a bench and opens a bag of curry bread. The seasons have changed and it’s almost summer but she doesn’t have any plans. She sees XX appearing on the other side of the bench. XX makes a comment to Ako that the construction here has finished. XX keeps talking and Ako keeps trying to ignore him making comments in her mind that he was such an irritating guy and that’s why he doesn’t have any friends. She makes note that despite having no friends, he really should stop clinging to girls so much. She then looks up and sees a big sign that says Laundry Heaven. The old convenience store has now renovated into a coin laundromat. She was really disappointed as she assumed that it would just reopen into a new convenience store. Ako blames XX for this but doesn’t know why, it just must be his fault. XX asks Ako if she likes laundromats but she says that she doesn’t particularly like them. She also makes note that she’s been avoiding sweets and the reason for this is a secret. Ako then sees a large roadside sign with a picture that she thinks is of a Tanuki. XX says that it’s actually a raccoon and the markings are different. In her mind, she thinks that she’s the only one that can put up with a guy who doesn’t understand a girls heart. She also doesn’t understand why he’s eating bread here and must feel a bit lonely. After finishing her own bread, Ako glances over at Xx’s bread to he responds “I’m not giving you any”. In Ako’s mind she thinks he’s being rude and a charming guy would offer her a bite without her even having to ask, she believes she has to look after that childish boy for a while longer.

# Epilogue

A night has passed since the confession, Kazu couldn’t sleep much and is in the printing room with Komari. They are printing the club’s stories. Komari makes note that Kazu is a bit off today. Throughout the entire conversation with Komari, he keeps wondering why he couldn’t give Tiara an answer right away even going so far to wish Tiara was more assertive and not cared how he felt. Komari clearly sensing Kazu is being weird today, tells him she will finish up and to wait in the clubroom to which Kazu complies.

In the hallway, he sees an ad on the newspaper for a paid feature of Lemon’s secret photo shoot, he holds up his phone to scan the QR code when Lemon comes in. He congratulates Lemon for making Nationals but Lemon believed the congrats to be a bit weak. Lemon sees Kazu’s camera is still open from trying to scan the QR code and thinks he’s trying to sneak a photo of her. Lemon says she’s going to tell Chihaya about this(that the rumours are true that he is indeed the enemy of all women) to Kazu’s horror. Lemon smacks him on the back once more and leaves.

Back in the classroom, Kazu sees Riko feeding Anna little Chikuwa sausages. Riko sees Kazu come in and offers to feed him too but he passes. The three of them talk a bit before Tiara enters asking for Kazu which causes him to jump due to the events that happened the day prior. She then gives Kazu a bunch of promotional pop ups featuring Chikapyon that she promised to give to him. Tiara ask if Kazu will be late today as she wants to walk home with him. “CLICK” The stapler in Anna’s hand echoed through the room. Anna asks why they are still going home together since the election is over. Tiara says no reason then ask to borrow Riko. The two of them leave and it’s revealed that Riko has decided to join the student council. Right before Tiara leaves, she ask Kazu why he isn’t calling her by her first name which causes Anna to stare at him. Tiara closes the door to the club room.

Anna complains to Kazu that he still calls her by her last name with -san but already calls Tiara by her first name. Kazu responds that during the election Anna was always with Sakurai and it’s not a good look since he’s so popular with the girls. Anna accuses Kazu about being jealous. Kazu tries to justify this by saying that he doesn’t want weird rumours being spread about Sakurai due to hanging with her. Eventually in his mind he admits he was being jealous and that Sakurai was one of his few guy friends so he felt left out when Anna and him were getting along so well. He came to the conclusion, that he was feeling this way because Anna was getting close to him, with that assumption, it gave him peace. Anna tries to ask Kazu about what was the prompt she got. Kazu lies saying it said “male friend”, but Anna doesn’t buy it. Anna also reveals that she’s the one that sent Riko into the student council to Kazu’s surprise.

Anna then walks over to the window but Kazu couldn’t see her expression. He then starts thinking about Tiara confessing to him on the bridge and how he was confused unsure about his own answer. More than anything he wanted to say yes. In the present, he sees a shadow come across his eyes. (It’s heavily implied that this is Anna’s shadow, I will talk more about below). In his mind he’s still trying to work out how he truly feels and that he couldn’t do that in one night. He starts to wonder how many nights Tiara spent before deciding to confess to him. Anna then says it’s getting dark and pulls the curtains shut. They both start staring at each other in silence, Anna breaks the tension by saying “Nukumizu-kun, you really are the enemy of women, huh?”

\*So regarding the “shadow” part. The MTL actually mistranslated this part. I’ve talked to people who can read Japanese and Chinese, they talk about how the Japanese Kanji does not say “mind” like the MTL implies. The MTL states “I almost said yes, the shadow of someone flickered through my mind”. The actual translation is that he sees a physical shadow in the present when he’s thinking about why he almost said yes. While both translations heavily imply that Anna is the one that caused Kazu to hesitate. The MTL suggests that Anna’s shadow appears in Kazu’s mind and that causes him to completely disregard Tiara’s confession. The actual translation suggests that he hesitated and in the present time while thinking back to why he hesitated, a shadow flashes across his eyes. OBVIOUSLY, Anna is the only other person in the room who’s also sitting next to a window. So the implication that she’s the reason he hesitated is the same. The actual translation just shows more respect towards Tiara’s feelings.",2,1748029804.0,TooManyLosingHeroines,6,1.0,False
1ktst2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/credit_cards/comments/1ktst2l/is_wells_fargo_active_cash_card_good_as_everyday/,Is Wells Fargo Active Cash Card Good as Everyday Card for 2025?," I just got approved for the Wells Fargo Active Cash card earlier this week and have already used it a few times, mostly for groceries, gas, and random Amazon stuff. I wanted a card with decent cash back that didn’t make me jump through a ton of hoops, and this one caught my eye with the flat 2% back on everything. No rotating categories, no weird rules, just swipe and go. That’s exactly what I needed.

The signup process was smooth, and I got my digital card the same day to add to my Apple Wallet, which was a nice bonus. I used it at Target and my local coffee shop, and the cash back showed up quickly in my rewards balance. I’m not planning to carry a balance, but the 0% intro APR was also a nice safety net in case something unexpected comes up.

This is my first time using a Wells Fargo credit card, so I’m still figuring out how their app and reward system works, but so far I like how simple it is. Curious if anyone else has been using this card for a while, do the rewards stay consistent? Any issues over time? Trying to see if this will be my main card or just something I use for now.",1,1748029792.0,credit_cards,0,1.0,False
1ktst09,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1ktst09/teacher_crush_went_from_distant_to_kinda_flirty/,Teacher crush went from distant to kinda flirty today and I’m losing it,"Okay so I (19M) have had a crush on one of the teachers at my French school for months now. He’s probably in his 30s, very reserved, clean-cut, well-dressed—honestly just someone I look forward to seeing every week. We’ve never had a full conversation, just small interactions here and there. Nothing major…  

when I arrived, he opened the door for me and said, “Bonjour ” I responded, then went to sit somewhere where I could see into the other room through a slightly open door. Our eyes crossed a couple of times—I kept looking, and I think he noticed. There was something in the way we held eye contact. Subtle, but definitely a moment.

Later, during the break, he came up to me with a coffee and asked if I wanted one. I was so caught off guard, nervous, and surprised that I said no.and then kind of teasing asked if I wanted whisky instead. I smiled and said yes, with ice please . And then I just… went back to class. Heart racing. Mind racing even more.

Now I can’t stop thinking about it. Why did I say no? I wish I had just said yes and had that moment with him. I keep wondering—was that just him being nice? Or was it something more? I really don’t know if he’s into me or just playful by nature. I feel like I fumbled the moment, even though he didn’t act weird or distant after. If anything, he kept the vibe going.

I’ll probably see him again tomorrow,i feel like that “no” is a turn off.

Any advice or thoughts are welcome. My brain is doing backflips.

What the heck? Are any comely bank locals around, is it that bad for dog owners there? I have a small bichon frise who adores her walks and I’m a bit disappointed by the No dogs allowed in most green areas or straight up private. :( 

There doesn’t seem to be many dog places around as well like coffee shops that near by. 

There’s a cementery which might be dog friendly Comely Bank cementary. Do let me know if allowed?

She took my phone from me and told me to guess her first 3 digits in a playful tone. We talked a bit on break, she brought up her personal family life, how she's busy babysitting her step-sister and all sorts of things. I said Let's go get a coffee next week She said, ""Sure! I work 6 days next week, but il be down. We can talk about it next week during our shifts"". For some reason, she said her car was awful and too shy to show it, and we could use my car. So she told me where she lived and took it from there. She smiles a lot when we talk, and asks about when I work a lot, idk lol.

So she is just a very dry texter. She never asks about me or initiates conversations when we text. She also takes forever to respond to something basic. Today I asked her to take on break and get a coffee and told her to text me when ur free, she said np. Well, hours went by, and she texted me, ""Hey, I'm so sorry I'm really busy and was not able to go on break with you."" I saw her in the lunchroom btw.

Now I don't understand if she's playing me or being nice since we're co-workers. I don't care if she's not interested, but I've come to the conclusion to not text her anymore or engage, just be a co-worker and see how she reacts.

Seeing posts here and on TG of reminders and requirements needed on the day of examination is so nostalgic. 

Tasa moments and encouragement from our reviewers and mentors to meet them again as colleagues in the field. I want to study and review again. I want that 3 letters attached on my name, really bad. It’s not that I have forgotten about becoming a CPA, it has always been on my mind. Failure after failure did not stop me from dreaming, it actually made me more eager to attain the title.

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued — but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.



After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I’m honestly impressed.

This isn’t just another energy pill — it’s something different, and in this review, I’ll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it’s worth considering.



What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body’s ability to create real energy at the cellular level.



That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves — from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.



What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what’s inside:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.



PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).



N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.



Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.



Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.



In other words, Mitolyn isn’t throwing random ingredients together — it’s built around a clear, science-backed strategy.



My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.



Week 1-2:

At first, I didn’t feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.



Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""



Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn’t been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.



The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I’m no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.



Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.



Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.



Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.



Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger — more vibrant and ""alive.""



Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:



Clean, research-based ingredient list



No stimulants, no crash



Noticeable improvements after consistent use



Supports both mind and body



Manufactured with high quality standards



Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens



Cons:



Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)



Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements



Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)



Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:



Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep



Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness



Want better exercise performance and recovery



Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally



Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements



However, if you’re just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn’t for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.



Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely — especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.



I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I’m fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.



Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.



Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.



✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



If you’re serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

Just give it time — think of it as building your foundation, not putting up a quick tent.

I don’t normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.



My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.



I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”



The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.



By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.



Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.



Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.



Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.



Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.



Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.



Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:



✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.



✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.



✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!



✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.



✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.



Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:



Bloating or gas



Irregular bowel movements



Leaky gut or food intolerances



Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings



Skin issues like acne or rashes



Weakened immunity



Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...



Then this product is 100% for you.



Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.



Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.



Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.



I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

Similarly, Alexa from Wyoming mentioned, “I used to need so much Botox to keep the wrinkles away that my face was permanently frozen.

1ktshkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1ktshkw/12_years_of_limerence_i_am_so_tired/,12 years of limerence. I am so tired,"Hello there,

12 years of one limerence episode here. This will be confused as hell, but I just need to get it out of my system, and I don't have the mental energy to make it make sense. It was a crush at first sight. He noticed and lovebombed me hard. After the first sex (best sex of my life, of course), he changed into this hot-cold mess. I knew I should end it right then and there, but I couldn't. 6 years of me obsessing over every single detail, destroying my boundaries; I tried therapy in the meantime, but it didn't help a bit. Then he left me, slow fade out. To this day I don't know the reason.

So I stopped trying and went NC. At that time I came across the term limerence. Everything suddenly made sense, but it didn’t help much, as I realised I am fucked (pardon my French). I began counting the days, missing him every second. At day 200 I thought I was free. On day 201, he contacts me out of the blue to wish me a happy new year (on january 4). I crumble. He asks if we can meet for coffee. I said yes, hoping to get some answers/closure. He never made the arrangements; he ghosted me again. Three months later, he sends me a birthday text, asking if he can call me. I say yes again in hopes of, again, some answers. He never called.

So I told myself for the third time to just move on. I sent him a ""final"" message, saying something like, ""please leave me alone if you don't know what you want."" He never even opened it.

A year later I get another msg, him asking me to have a coffee. Guess what I said, and we actually went for the damn coffee. His hugs were long, and he was flirting hard, giving me compliments, apologies... then in the middle of it, his mobile rings. It was a female name with a heart emoji next to it. He didn't answer, but the moment was gone.

So for the fourth time, you got your answer; move on.

Then every six or eight months, he would text me, with the same bullshit; I would always say yes, and he would then ghost me again.

I lost all of my self-respect long ago, don't worry.

1 year ago I bumped into him in the city (small city) with a small child, a few months old, his partner pushing the stroller beside him. We exchange looks; he acts like he doesn't know me. I speed up the street, only to literally collapse when I thought I was far away enough.

So, now for like the tenth time, move on; never answer his text again.

The next day he calls me, which he never did, since he ""dumped"" me. Telling me how sorry he is, he didn't tell me and didn't want me to find out this way. blah blah blah.

We end the conversation on a friendly note, although everything inside me is shouting, ""Just leave me alone!""

For me, that was it. I got my closure. I finaly really started to move on, starting to love myself again, day by day.

3 weeks ago he contacted me again. I got scared and didn't reply. He sends another txt. And another. I cave in again, and he vanishes again.

I finally had it, called him and threw everything into his ear. I asked him to not contact me again. I established boundaries for the first time in 12 years.

And now I am crying my eyes out. But I am also proud of myself. I know this is the right path for me.

I know how toxic this situation is, I know he is an idiot, and I am aware of my share of the situation. But I just can't develop feelings for anyone else. I'm totally shut down.

Next week I'm getting a psychiatric evaluation for behavioural disorders; in two weeks I am starting with regular psychotherapy sessions.

I just want this pain to stop. I tried everything in the book, and I'm so tired. Sometimes I despise myself so much for my stupidity and inability to move on.

Thanks for reading this, if you by any chance got this far.

Stay strong, everyone. :\*",7,1748028977.0,limerence,3,1.0,False

What’s a reasonable timeline to set as a goal to graduate from HENRY to HER? 

I am a second career worker, who became a HENRY about 5 years ago.  I’m a little older than other people at my level in the industry, and don’t have the benefit of being SINK or DINK at this income to keep expenses low. I have two young kids and a spouse (who is also career switching and in the middle of their studies, not doing loans). My first child was born about 6 months before my income went up to HENRY status, so I’ve never had this income without the corresponding higher expenses.

I do understand that with two kids under 5, a spouse in school, a new mortgage in a VHCOL region, and a few years left on my student loans, that I am in the peak of my spending years. We’re not living luxuriously, but we do treat ourselves to things like a once a year vacation or regular coffee shop visits.

I want to maximize these earnings to set us all up for the long term, and look forward to the peace of mind that will come from a positive net worth. We do all the things like maxing out retirement, kids 529s etc. but I’m wondering what kind of timeline other HENRYs who became HENRY around the birth of their first child are working with. I feel like the savings can really accelerate in 2-5 years when the youngest enters public school and my student loans are finally gone, and my spouse starts earning again….until then, what are your tips and recommendations? What is your timeline? If you have any method other than the 4% rule to figure out your “number” what is it? 

Thanks!

1ktsbr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ktsbr8/the_winter_guest_vanished_overnight_then_three/,The winter guest vanished overnight. Then three smiling men came for him.,"I was working as a winter caretaker at a closed-down lodge in Wyoming.

The place was halfway up a mountain — six miles from the nearest town, ten from the nearest gas station, and probably fifteen from anyone who could actually hear you scream. The owners shut it down for the season and wanted someone to keep an eye on things. Just a few months, they said. “Plow the driveway after storms, keep the pipes from freezing, make sure no one breaks in.” Easy money.

It snowed every other day.

Most mornings were wrapped in that sickly pink-blue glow you only get in high-altitude winters. Everything was hushed, as if the world itself were holding its breath. The floors creaked even when I wasn’t moving. I’d wake up at 3:12 AM almost every night for no reason. I thought it was just the cold.

The days blurred into each other. I cooked the same meals. Walked the same halls. The lounge still had fake pine garlands nailed above the windows, leftover from last Christmas. They didn’t move. Nothing moved. The whole place felt paused.

Then one evening, headlights.

A beat-up SUV pulled into the snow-packed lot. A man climbed out. Medium height, rough beard, heavy parka, limping slightly. I opened the side door and met him on the porch.

He didn’t offer a name, just asked, “Mind if I stay a night or two? Got turned around. Storm’s coming.”

His voice was dry, but alert. The kind of guy who looks at exits when he walks into a room.

Something about him made my shoulders tighten. Maybe it was the way his eyes never quite stopped moving. Or how he never took off his gloves, even when he came inside.

I gave him a room anyway.

He ate breakfast the next morning in silence. Oatmeal and black coffee. Said thanks. Went back upstairs.

That was the last I saw of him.

At noon, I knocked on his door to check in. No answer. I opened it. Empty. No bags. No coat. Bed made.

Like no one had ever been there.

I stood in the hallway for a full minute, staring at the carpet.

Had I imagined him?

The dirty plate was still in the sink.

That night I couldn’t sleep. Every floorboard groaned like a sigh. The silence wasn’t passive anymore — it was listening. Watching. The snow outside seemed… off. Not just heavy — thicker, almost too solid. Like if you stepped into it, you might not come back out.

Then, around 3 AM, I saw the glow.

Fire.

I bolted downstairs and saw the gazebo out back — fully engulfed in flames. Standing around it were three men.

I opened the back door and shouted:
“Hey! What the hell are you doing?”

One turned toward me, face flickering in the firelight.
“Give us the man who came last night,” he said calmly. “We know he’s here.”

“He’s gone,” I shouted. “He’s not here anymore!”

They didn’t move. Didn’t speak again. Just stood there.

I grabbed the shotgun from under my bed and went out. Crunching through the snow, wind biting my ears, heart pounding.

As I got closer, I realized — they weren’t men. Not anymore.

They were mannequins.

Just… mannequins. Human-sized. Wearing winter jackets and gloves. Painted faces — each with a bright, cartoonish smile. One had an axe in its hand. It wasn’t plastic.

I kicked one. It toppled backward, stiffly.

No reaction.

I stumbled back inside. Got the fire extinguisher. When I came back out — they were gone.

The gazebo was still burning. I doused it. Didn’t sleep.

Next morning, I called the local sheriff’s station. Told them everything — the visitor, the fire, the mannequins.

There was a pause. Then the deputy said:
“Sir, we sent an officer up there four days ago. The place was empty. He said it looked abandoned. No car. No footprints.”

I blinked. “I’ve been here the whole time.”

Another pause. Then:
“Mister, you called us two weeks ago and told us you were leaving early. Said you were driving back to Montana. We have it on record.”

My skin went cold.

“I didn’t make that call,” I whispered.

The deputy’s voice softened. “Are you sure you’re okay, sir?”

I hung up.

I left that same day.

Didn’t pack much. Just got in my truck and drove until I stopped shaking. I didn’t even remember the turnoff to the lodge disappearing in the mirror. I didn’t want to.

A week later, I visited my mom back in Billings. She asked for help sorting old boxes. We sat in the living room, surrounded by dusty photo albums, childhood drawings, broken ornaments. I was just starting to calm down.

Then I saw the picture.

Me, maybe five years old, holding my mom’s hand outside an old clothing store. Yellowed photo. Sun glare. A crooked smile on my kid face.

Behind us, in the shop window, were three mannequins.

Winter coats. Gloves. Each with that same painted smile.

I stared at the photo until my vision blurred. My mom kept talking, but I didn’t hear her.

They were there.
Back then.
Watching.

I don’t know if what happened in that lodge was real.

1ktsbm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1ktsbm6/my_children_i_are_stuck_with_my_toxic_alcoholic/,My children & I are stuck with my toxic alcoholic boyfriend of 5 years. Help.,"I [29F] have been with my boyfriend [30M] for 5 years.
I have endured emotional, mental, & verbal abuse for the majority of it, stupidly convinced it was my fault for causing him to react the way he did for a very long time. 

-I definitely have some people pleasing, co dependent attachment issues, struggle with standing up for myself, & have always dealt with low self confidence & self esteem due to mean girl bullying all throughout high school. Small town high school bullying (being called a slut, hearing people insult me as I would walk thru the hallways between classes, told no one likes me, told to kill myself, etc.) The bullying got so bad that I did end up dropping out of high school a little over half way thru my junior year, getting my GED & starting to work full time at 17. (not really relevant to this story, other than giving a bit of backstory as to my self confidence issues.)-

My boyfriend and father of our children is an alcoholic, a binge alcoholic. Goes on 5-14 day binges, no memory of spans of time, blowing all his money, driving while drunk. Most recently he crashed his car, it is sitting at the dealership as we speak, & has no recollection of doing so.
We have 2 children together, our son is almost 2 and we have a 6 month old daughter.

The night our daughter was born, he had been yelling at me for hours all evening. Calling me fat, ugly, a dumb stupid cunt, a slut, etc.
Wouldn’t believe me when I said I felt that I needed to go to ER due to pain.
He also was way too drunk to drive me (I hadn’t realized how much he had already drank.) Due to the back & forth for hours between us, & his yelling/name calling, I believe I wasn’t as focused on the pain as I should have been & went to the bathroom to what I thought fart or poop. Not even 30 seconds later, our daughter was making her entrance into the world in the bathroom at our apartment.
He was too drunk to call 911 as I was screaming at him to do so, he was making fun of me & continuing to call me names not understanding the severity of what had just happened. So I called 911 while sitting on the toilet, our newborn wrapped in a towel. EMTs and police arrived within minutes thankfully.

Our daughter was/is perfectly fine. A healthy happy little 6 month old chunk now. 
He was instructed by police officers that responded to the 911 call not to drive to the hospital, he was being incredibly loud & over the top when he arrived at the hospital with my mom, almost acting as if he was out at a bar. I was incredibly embarrassed with the situation to begin with as I felt I was already being judged for not getting to the hospital in time, & how he was acting made everything 10 times worse. 
He doesn’t have any recollection of our daughter being born, or the events that followed. I was so in the moment & overwhelmed, I let him pick out her name at the hospital, as we hadn’t decided on one yet. If i would have known how drunk he was, I never would have given him the privilege. Although I love her name, I would be lying if I said it didn’t give me a sadness & guilt, due to how her name came to be.

He left me alone in the hospital for the 2 nights our daughter & I were in there, so he could come back home & drink. Lying to me the entire time telling me he wasn’t. Blowing my phone up one night that I was in the hospital, telling me I was cheating on him. Mind you I had just birthed our daughter at our apartment maybe 24 hours previously.

When I found out I was pregnant with our first, he convinced me to quit my job & be a full time stay at home mom, which I wasn’t opposed to.
Except now, he withholds all money from me. Does not get things for our children when we need (diapers, formula, new paci’s, etc.) I have to rely on my parents most of the time for those things. I am beyond blessed and grateful to have the parents I do.
He calls me lazy, insults my work ethic, makes fun of the fact that “i have no skill set,” calls everything in our apartment his, even the apartment itself even though we are both in the lease. Screams at me to gtfo multiple times a week.
Screams at me & belittles me in front of our children. Tells me our children will grow up to hate me.

He goes to work and comes home to sit on his game, headset on, ignoring me & the children, usually yelling at me or his game until I get our children to bed. 
I am then expected to have sex with him, or I am told that I must be cheating on him. Or I’m called a whore, gross, or comments are made about my body post pregnancies. All this with him knowing I have battled anorexia & disordered eating since I was 15 years old.
Most recently I found that he had a secret tinder & Snap. He made me delete all of my social medias months ago because he was convinced I was cheating on him.
I was scolded for getting on his phone & finding the Tinder & Snap, even tho he had just given me his password & put my face ID on his phone during a day he was acting “nice.” He says it’s not a big deal, because he only talked to 1 or 2 girls on snap, & a few on Tinder. Just casual conversation, nothing sexual, no pictures sent or received. Not that I really believe that.

He threatens violence, mostly if he has been drinking but sometimes sober. This has started more recently, after the birth of our daughter. Talks about either buying or already owning a gun (i know he does not
own one currently, I think he just says that in hopes to scare me.) He has shoved me while I was holding our son, a few times. He has choked me, picking me up by my neck & slamming me down onto our coffee table that broke. His mother was a witness, although she enables his behavior & regularly lies for him so I only have photos of the aftermath of things. He’s broken thru 3 separate bedroom doors, each time because I’ve tried going into our bedroom with our children to get away from him & his screaming.
He has gone to jail once due to domestic, but the charges were dropped because the next morning I spoke to the prosecutor & recounted some of what I had said, essentially helping him get out of the charges.

I know, incredibly stupid. I have been gaslit and manipulated for such a long time, while also trying to keep myself together for our children that I sometimes don’t know what actually happened vs if I might be overreacting. He has me convinced he is this was because of the things that happened to him & the environment he grew up in as a child, which I can empathize with to a certain extent. He just doesn’t do anything to change the way he acts.

I have a laundry list of worries that come with leaving, however one of my biggest ones is what if he is given 50/50 or worse..full custody if I do leave & we go thru the whole court process, because he has a stable well paying job to support our kids & I do not. I also now have a gap in my resume due to him & I agreeing that I would stay at home with our kids as to avoid the cost of daycare.

My parents are in a place where they can fully support myself & my children, while giving me an apartment to stay in while I get myself back on my feet as far as finding work again.
I am just so terrified that I will be looked at as lesser, or not as fit for the children to be with solely based on the job situation.

I am their primary caretaker, have been for their entire lives. I do not feel it is safe for them to be in his care by themselves, as he has shown multiple times that he will drink to the point of blacking out & still try to care/pick up our children with me here. Stumbling around with them, or just neglecting them due to being so drunk. 
Since he technically hasn’t been in any legal trouble other than a public intoxication charge he had gotten 10+ years ago, I am scared to death that since I don’t technically have proof of him being dangerous, he won’t have any kind of “rules” or “stipulations” put in place deeming him safe to care for our children alone.
Aside from countless recordings of him screaming at me or just yelling in general, photos of the damage in the aftermath of him raging, & countless texts from him vaguely threatening me, admitting to drinking & driving, just overall being a vile person. 
I feel that I don’t have much to prove how much of a danger he truly is.

i’ve lost connections with mostly all
of my friends/support systems due to him, his actions, or due to him isolating me from anyone other than himself very early on in our relationship.
I am scared to leave. I am scared to stay.

I'm happy to say that after nearly 3 years of work, 30k+ lines of code, and a lot of coffee it's ready to use.

Check it out here, [emberdesign.net](http://emberdesign.net)

It's still very much in development so we're considering this an open beta. We expect you'll run into some bugs or jankness and if you do, please DM me or share in our discord https://discord.gg/xEXQHtGsT8. We want ALL the feedback, we believe we can build something far superior to what we have now but we can't do it without your help.

There's also a twist, Ember isn't just an embroidery editing application but an entire network where you can share your designs publicly and favorite other users designs. Our goal is to lower the barrier to entry to machine embroidery, not just by lowering the cost and building an easy-to-use editor but also by giving new digitizers the ability to view existing designs and gain inspiration as well as see how other users approach digitizing.

As for the editor, here's some features we offer:

* Satin lines and curves, with parameters for density and width
* Satin blocks (often referred to as classic satin)
* Single and triple runs with adjustable stitch length
* Multiple fill patterns, with parameters for angle, stitch length, and row spacing, hand stitch effect, multiple underlays, and the ability to control start and end points
* 20ish free font packs with multiple sizes
* Brand specific color palettes
* Realistic view
* Open shapes, closed shapes, rectangles, circles, bezier curves
* Resizing, reshaping, cutting holes
* exporting to multiple machine file types
* Being able to share an embroidery by simply sharing its link

what Ember is not:

* An auto-digitizing app. In fact, there's no auto-digitizing capability right now. We'll offer this in the future but we're more concerned with the core editing experience right now, as even with auto digitizing a user will still be using the editor to fix and tweaks things
* A replacement for your high-end embroidery software. We'd love for this to be the case one day but right now we're aiming for a refined experience that is inviting to new users, not overwhelming

Anyways sorry for the wall of text, please give it a try and let us know how you like it and what could be improved! I also added a picture of some of my designs, you can actually find some of them in the explore page [emberdesign.net/explore](http://emberdesign.net/explore)

1kts7ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1kts7ax/aria_sky_suite_penthouse_for_free/,Aria Sky Suite Penthouse -- For FREE?!,"TL;DR: >!There seemed to be a significant glitch on the MGM app 2 days ago (May 21), allowing some users to book ANY room at ANY MGM property for FREE (+resort fee). It was real and I did get to use it, but it wasn’t without some effort and hassle.!<   
  
Hey Reddit! Devin here from Travel And Credit Cards, and I can’t believe what just happened.
  
Wednesday morning (May 21), I was perusing travel apps, and just decided to see what room rates were like that day in Vegas. Not that I had any intention of going; I’m gonna be back on Monday anyway. Surprisingly, when I got to the MGM app, I was greeted with an offer for a [complimentary night](https://i.imgur.com/7Ujw6jw.jpeg) at any MGM resort! That’s great!...right? 
  
Well, I had to consider my situation:   
* I don’t have status with MGM;  
* I had about $1500 coin-in split evenly across 2 visits this year (Jan, March);  
* On that day, the highest cost for a base room was [$800](https://i.imgur.com/9lD9Y2F.jpeg) at the Aria and it still displayed comp;  
* I very consistently receive discount offers, not comp offers, stuff like $110/nt aria, $50/nt Park MGM (nothing special).  
  
All this in mind, I was pretty sure it was a glitch. I’ve previously encountered a different MGM glitch that seemed similar at the start: one would earn a myVegas comp night for a specific resort, then when redeeming it, the website would show that every resort is eligible for comp, not just the selected resort. This glitch would fix itself if you tried to click an ineligible hotel; for example, if I redeemed a Mandalay Bay night and tried to select Bellagio, the system would say something like “Oops! The offer you selected is not available at the selected resort.”  
  
This was completely different. I selected Aria, and to my amazement, EVERY room type they had available showed strikethrough pricing and a fully comped rate.    
  
I hastily scrolled to the bottom of the list to select the biggest and baddest suite available, which in this case was the [Sky Suites Two Bedroom Penthouse - Mountain View](https://i.imgur.com/T8fUxyC.jpeg). It went into my cart as just the resort fee ($55 + tax = $62.36), and a 30-minute checkout timer started counting down.  
  
At this point, I thought it might be possible to capitalize on this, but I had to check a few things so I didn’t get burned or miss better opportunities. While my cart timer was ticking down in the iOS app, I went to the website on a separate device to see if I could still see the same offer. It was not there, and I was back to my regular discount pricing. I also logged into my player 2’s account, which has no gambling spend, and there was no offer or glitch pricing there either.  
  
After checking those avenues, I figured I couldn’t try to adjust the stay or the glitch would be gone, so I had to take it or leave it. [Obviously, I took it.](https://i.imgur.com/5ZWsMVf.png) My card didn’t get charged at that moment, and I got a confirmation email showing the $0 room rate. I am very fortunate to have a family member who works for a major airline, so I got my ass on a plane and got to the Aria as fast as I could.   
  
The first thing that made it a bit difficult was that the online check-in process wasn’t working. My room was ready a bit before I got there, so I tried to do the usual process through the app and ID.me, but it failed every time across multiple devices. This was especially unfortunate, as I really didn’t want to have to go to the front desk and risk the error being seen/fixed.  
  
I did eventually arrive, and once I found the Sky Suites lobby, I went up to the front desk, email confirmation at the ready. I handed over my ID and CC as usual. The woman at the front desk stated I had a balance to pay on the room, and asked if I wanted to know the amount (presumably because people in the Sky Suites are often wealthy and don’t care?). I hoped beyond hope that she would just say $62.36 and we would call it a day.   
  
*Nope. $1026.09.*  
  
I told her about the comp room and showed her the email confirmation. She said on her end it was showing up as a cash booking. That confirms it was a glitch, but I had proof of a valid booking, and the room itself was still available. She called Casino VIP Services and asked them if they could comp the room since my confirmation showed it. Not gonna lie, I was starting to sweat a little right about here. 

Based on that call, it seemed like she couldn’t do anything, but she still wanted to hear me out. I insisted my reservation was legit, and indeed it was, as the MGM app and website were still showing $0 + resort fee when I logged in. She stated her manager had gone into the back for a break, but to give her my phone and they would check it out. I figured she was going to bat for me, so why not? She took my phone to the back and they were (presumably) looking at my MGM app for a solid 3-4 minutes.

The front desk agent came back with my phone and said they still couldn’t figure out what happened, but they were going to try to work it out. She said they would have to authorize the full amount plus incidental hold of $350/nt. Fine by me, I have plenty of credit limit as long as I don’t have to actually pay it. 

Then the manager came out from the back and asked me to forward my confirmation email and screenshots of the MGM app to her @aria.com email address, that way she could work with Casino VIP Services to ensure the room is actually comped.

Once I finally got into the room, it was gorgeous, spacious and luxurious. I made a [quick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6Riaezi2Ho) to show it off.

I came back to the lounge in the evening to confirm if she had gotten everything I forwarded; she did. I also went back in the morning to ask a different front desk agent if they were able to get the room rate updated for me. They confirmed the room was comped and I just had to pay the resort fee.

A few cool things: they offer free snacks, coffee, water, juice and soda in the Sky Suites lounge, as well as wine and beer from 4-9p.

1kts5z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kts5z7/my_30m_bf_says_i_27f_prioritize_work_too_much_but/,"My (30M) bf says I (27F) prioritize work too much, but he’s basically unemployed. Is this just a difference in values or a dealbreaker?","I’ve been with my bf for 6 years now. He’s a content creator and posts 2-3 times a year when certain products are released. I have a 9-5 job that is in my passion. I work from home, about 35 hours a week (40 on a hard week), and I have a side job related to my full time job that takes about 10-15 hours a month. I love my job, although it can be stressful at times, but it’s ultimately what I want to be doing. And I really don’t think I overwork or prioritize it more than other things. 

I’ve always been super open about finances, but my bf has not, which I respected and didn’t push after some unpleasant conversations about finances. I thought as long as he had it together, I was okay with it. I recently found out that he is getting help from his parents on rent and his car payment (so, I’m the only one paying rent essentially), and he hasn’t made a livable wage from his content creation since around Covid, which is why he needs the help. When he isn’t making content, which is about 3 weeks out of the year, he’s doing whatever he wants all day long. We’ve been living together for 2 years now, and it’s frustrating that he hasn’t tried to find another source of income and is okay just taking help from his parents. He’s not a 9-5 type of person, and that’s okay, but I would like him to do something. 

We were arguing recently over the financial situation, and he told me that my job is taking away from my ability to be 100% present in our relationship and that it doesn’t benefit him at all. He thinks the time I spend working and then the carryover after work, whether it’s stress or tiredness, is affecting us negatively. He also said he doesn’t benefit from me having this job. I disagree since I’m the only one actually affording rent and our split household costs like groceries. He also said that if my focus was 100% on our household, then our house (between both of us) would be spotless. I’ll admit I’m messier, occasionally leaving my coffee mug and breakfast dishes in the sink until after work, or not getting a chance to clean the litter box during my work day. I also have ADHD so will let laundry pile up and my office get cluttered, but I’m working on it and always make sure our common area is tidy. I think this is normal, but he sees it as a lack of investment on my part. (For the record, no he doesn’t do more of the housework than me other than vacuuming the house 1-2 times a day. But dishes, bathrooms, everything else we split. I do most of the cooking, too.) 

He basically told me that he doesn’t regret not having had a job for the past two years because we were able to spend a lot of time together and that I’m ungrateful for not seeing the things he does for me like make me the occasional breakfast or coffee during work. I am grateful for these moments, but in my opinion, now is when we should be working to build a life together, which involves financial contribution from both parties. I honestly would have preferred less time together the past two years if it meant we could talk about marriage, buying a house, having kids in a realistic way now. Given that I’m supporting myself on about $60k a year and he isn’t contributing anything else scares me. 

He said he never wants to be the person that work takes them away from their family or who prioritizes work over their family. He’s raised the concern that if we had kids, I’d be distracted by my job. I had working parents growing up and it just makes sense to me that I’d be able to have both without being villainized. His belittlement of my job is hurtful because he knows it’s my dream job and a super competitive field, so I care about it, but I also do prioritize our home the rest of the time. I feel like he doesn’t understand since he’s never had a “normal” job. He’s been working on creating an app that he says can bring us a lot of money in the future, and he’s upset that I’m not being super supportive of it. Honestly, I am supportive and am happy he’s so invested in this project, but I wanted him to find a steadier source of income first. Is this just a difference in values that we can work through or does it sound like a dealbreaker? 

Edit to add: I forgot an important detail! he said he had to work on his mental health for the past few years, which is why he didn’t seek a job sooner as well! This made me feel bad because I am empathetic to his mental health struggles, but he never shared this with me, so from my pov it looks like a lack of care or effort.

I want to bring some Coffee Beans and Cheddar Popcorn from my hometown to South Korea as gifts for my friends' family. I looked up all the prohibited to restricted items and nothing says much about coffee or the cheddar on the popcorn. However, since it is considered food and I heard that coffee is used to hide the scent of drugs, so I do not want to seem like I am hiding something (As stupid as that sounds). Also, cheese isn't usually allowed because it's an animal product. I feel like I should declare it. But I also have items that I don't need to declare.

Should I declare the coffee and popcorn, or don't declare it? Should I put it in my check baggage or carry on? They are from local sellers not chains, so I am not sure if it counts as a processed product which is usually allowed.

I had just gotten out of an abusive relationship and we were friends for a year before we started dating. I’ll admit I carried over some toxic traits I learned in the previous relationship to this one (like being jealous of his girl friends, ect), which I have since apologized for and grown from in my other relationships. We dated for 5 years and he was the best partner. He constantly was supportive of my passion for music, listened to me and asked questions to inquire further, bought me little gifts and date nights even when he didn’t have enough money, brought me around his family and more. I broke up with him when I was in college because I suffer from an extreme mental health issue and felt that I relied on him in an unhealthy way and needed to learn how to be ok on my own. Like what if something happened to him, or he left me, I needed to know that I would be okay on my own. Since then, I’ve dated 3 other guys. The first guy a few years after him was sweet and treated me well, but I just didn’t feel that much of a spark. The other to two guys were not as nice, one of which was extremely controlling and the other was super emotionally abusive. Over the years, we have kept in contact, wishing each other happy birthday for the last 7 years, and catching up over FaceTime or coffee once a year. Last year, we met up more than a few times and ended up kissing. He ultimately told me that he couldn’t be in a relationship because of his own personal issues. He eventually disclosed that he has a gambling addiction that he hasn’t told anybody about except for me, and that it started a few years ago. He hasn’t been in a relationship with anybody but me, ever, but he knows he can’t be in a relationship if he has this issue because he believes relationships are built on trust and financial trust and he doesn’t want to bring that into a relationship. He said if in a year, we’re still in the same place (location wise and single), he would be open to trying again if his issues are resolved. But I’m not sure if I should wait for him because what if the issue doesn’t resolve? What if he meets someone else? What if he changes his mind and doesn’t want me anymore? I would like some advice on how to handle this situation. ",1,1748028086.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Here's what gpt says- 

Here are a few neighborhoods or areas in Hyderabad that you might want to roast a bit, based on their unique quirks or traffic issues:

MG Road & Banjara Hills
A hotspot for fancy restaurants and glitzy shopping, but let’s be real: the traffic in these areas is a nightmare. It’s like trying to navigate a maze while people honk non-stop. And don’t even get me started on parking.

Secunderabad
Secunderabad has its charm, but it's also got some of the most confusing roads and random diversions. You’ll spend more time figuring out where you parked than actually getting to your destination.

Jubilee Hills
Oh, Jubilee Hills! It’s home to the rich and famous, but with those fancy houses come ridiculously congested lanes, bad traffic jams, and the occasional ""oops, wrong turn"" moment. You might get stuck here for hours, even if your destination is just around the corner.

Hitech City
With all the tech parks and corporate offices, Hitech City can feel like a chaotic swarm of cars, scooters, and office-goers in the morning and evening. The roads are narrow and the crowds make it feel like you're constantly in a race, just to get to your next meeting or coffee!

Ameerpet
Ameerpet's traffic is like a living nightmare during peak hours. Packed with coaching centers, malls, and a never-ending sea of rickshaws, it’s one of those places where you’re constantly dodging pedestrians, autos, and buses.

Charminar Area
A historical gem, sure, but when you’re in Charminar, you have to deal with narrow lanes, the hustle of street vendors, and vehicles literally trying to squeeze past each other. All that heritage is cool until you’re stuck for an hour because of a mini traffic jam.

These areas might be pretty, historic, or trendy, but traffic-wise? Yeah, they roast you.

1kts3rc,https://www.reddit.com/r/logoforsale/comments/1kts3rc/how_i_fell_in_love_with_logo_design/,How I fell in love with logo design,"I’ve been a logo designer for over 20 years now. But the story started way before that, when I was just a kid.

Back then, me and the neighborhood crew had this crazy tradition. We’d grab some glue, wait for it to get dark, and draw logos on the street like Nike, Adidas, Reebok, Asics. Then we’d light the glue on fire.  
It looked wild at night. Once it burned off, it left this rubbery imprint of the logo on the asphalt. Some of them stayed visible for months, even years.  
That’s when I fell in love with logos, before I even knew what graphic design was.

Later, in high school, I got into technical drawing, especially in AutoCAD. Honestly, before choosing a school, I had no idea what graphic design even meant. Around here, they used to call it “sign painting” or “firmopisac.”  
I loved comic books. I loved drawing. When they asked me during the entrance test what I wanted to be, I said “journalist.”  
But what I really meant was that I wanted to lay out and design magazines. I just didn’t know the right word for it.  
They told me, “You’re not a journalist, you’re a tech school guy.”  
They were right.

That school got me into clean lines, layouts, structure. Eventually, I ended up studying graphic design.  
At the entrance exam, the task was to design a logo from your initials using only pencil, collage paper, scissors. No computers.  
I cut out my letters in an architectural-style font and glued them onto silver paper. Got the highest score.

The first real logo I made on a computer was a coffee bean with two cups. I still have it. Might even list it soon on Logophi.

There’s just something about combining shape, meaning, and simplicity into one symbol that sticks with me to this day.

I 22F  have always been a loner. Growing up, I didn’t really have friends. It wasn’t until college that things began to shift, but even then, I stayed on the outskirts, watching other people form their cliques while I kept my distance.
I wouldn’t say I was ugly—most people would describe me as pretty, but I had that awkward, unsure energy that made social interactions feel like a constant struggle. 

I wasn’t good at reading cues, and I had this nagging fear of saying the wrong thing or being laughed at. So, I spent most of my days just trying to blend in.

Things changed, though. My first year of college brought some attention, mostly from the people in my classes. One of them, let's call him Joe, stood out. He was quiet. A little too quiet. He kept to himself, never seemed to engage with anyone, and often sat alone. But, there was this thing—this unsettling thing—he would always stare at me. 

Not in a casual way, but with this intense, almost predatory gaze. I didn’t think much of it at first. Maybe he was just shy, or maybe I reminded him of someone. Either way, I didn’t care much.

But I’ll admit, I was a sucker for the underdog. I knew what it felt like to want to make a connection but be too awkward to reach out. I felt bad for him in a way. So when our class was assigned a two-person group project, I figured, why not partner up with Joe? Maybe it would help him feel less isolated. Maybe I’d finally be able to break the ice.

I asked him if he wanted to be my partner. He looked surprised at first, then just nodded, his eyes never leaving mine for too long. Something about it sent a shiver down my spine, but I pushed it aside. We agreed to meet after class on Fridays to work on the project.
At first, everything seemed fine. 

He was strange—awkward, to the point of being uncomfortable to be around—but he was also polite. I thought maybe he just didn’t know how to act around people. But over time, little things started happening. I’d leave my lip gloss on the table while we worked, and it would vanish by the time I needed it again. 

A scrunchie I left in my bag would disappear. I didn’t think much of it at first. I thought maybe I was just disorganized. But then, one day, I asked Joe if he had seen any of my missing things, and he looked at me with that same blank stare and said, “No, I haven’t seen anything.”

A small knot of unease began to form in my stomach. But it wasn’t until the project moved to my apartment that things took a more disturbing turn.

Joe suggested we work at my place. I didn’t see any reason to refuse. My apartment was close to school, and it would be easier to focus without the distractions of campus life. Plus, the deadline for the paper was fast approaching.

Everything felt normal at first. We worked on the project quietly, his awkwardness hovering in the background, but nothing alarming. Then, I had to step away to use the bathroom. 

I remember hearing his footsteps as I walked back to the bathroom, slow and deliberate, almost too soft to be real. When I returned, I noticed something off—Joe wasn’t sitting at the table anymore. He wasn’t in the living room either. I crept down the hallway, trying to stay as quiet as possible, and that’s when I heard it: 

the unmistakable sound of my bedroom door creaking open.

I didn’t know what to do. My heart raced as I moved closer, holding my breath. Through the crack in the door, I saw him—Joe—standing at my underwear drawer, his hand trembling as he picked up a pair of my underwear. I watched, frozen, as he stuffed it into his pocket.
I couldn’t breathe. My mind went blank. What the hell was I supposed to do?

I backed away, retreating into the bathroom, my head spinning. I thought I was going to vomit. I stayed there, pretending I was still inside the whole time, even though my body felt like it was going to collapse under the weight of what I’d just seen.

When I finally heard him sit down at the table again, I forced myself to step back into the living room, trying my best to act casual. “I just got a message from my roommate,” I lied, my voice shaking. “She needs me to pick her up from somewhere. I’m going to have to head out soon.”

Joe didn’t protest. He just nodded silently, grabbed his stuff, and left.
After that, I couldn’t stand the thought of being around him. I threw myself into the project, trying to handle all the work myself. I didn’t even want to look at him anymore. But even then, it didn’t end.

I told my roommate, Crystal, everything. She was shocked, of course, but what she said next chilled me to my core.
“What if he was taking your stuff—your lip gloss, your scrunchie? What if he’s been taking it all along?”

The thought hit me like a punch to the stomach. I had no doubts in my mind that he had taken those things. But I was terrified. What if he had other things of mine? What if he had... more?

Crystal, being close friends with Joe’s roommate, Travis, suggested that we tell him. Maybe he could get into Joe’s room and see if he had any of my things. At that point, I was desperate for answers, so we went to Travis. He agreed to sneak into Joe’s room and take a look around.

A few days later, Travis texted Crystal with what he found. I will never forget that message.
Travis had found pictures of me. Not just any pictures—photos from my Instagram, ones taken in class, in the library, even from the coffee shop I went to every morning. He had printed them out and plastered them all over his walls. In his drawer, there were more of my missing items—lip gloss, hair ties, and, yes, more pairs of my underwear. But that wasn’t the worst part.

He had written notes. Scrawled in sloppy, frantic handwriting. How he wanted to follow me home, watch me sleep, take me when I wasn’t looking. The words were horrifying, filled with raw obsession and rage. I felt my stomach turn as I read them.

Travis said he was going to confront Joe. That night, he did. The confrontation didn’t go well. There was yelling, shouting, accusations. Travis called Joe a freak, a weirdo, a disgusting pervert. But the next day, Travis had packed up and dropped out of the program. He was gone. No explanation. Just gone.

We never saw him again.
Crystal and I talked about reporting it to the police, but for some reason, I didn’t feel like it would help. I was too afraid. I thought maybe it was over, that Joe had gone away for good.
But now... I see him. Every now and then, I’ll catch a glimpse of him—standing in the corner of a grocery store, lingering near the swimming pool, sitting in the library, watching me from the shadows. His eyes always meet mine, just for a second, and then he disappears.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m being hunted. I don’t think I can ignore this anymore. I need to report it to the police.
I’ll keep you updated if anything changes.

I said yes of course but I was surprised because of so many other tables that were free. But I thought maybe he sees the tv better from here. He never spoke to me. Later, another man joined and I’m not sure they knew each other but they were both Bulgarian for sure. 
This morning, I had put my coffee at a table and while I was getting some food, someone put his plate at my table again. When I came back, I saw this time a young guy who, again, made no attempt to talk with me and was on his phone all along. So my question is this:
Are Bulgarian people used to not leave someone alone at a table? Is it a thing with people like me, identified as western tourists? Does it happen also with women? Would only a man sit to a lonely man’s table and a woman with a woman?
I spoke with a Bulgarian lady today and she was unaware of any such cultural trend but then she told me she had never been alone at a Bulgarian hotel… Thoughts?",4,1748027422.0,Sofia,10,0.83,False

I went to a design studio recently that unveiled a model kitchen whose countertops *absorbed* light instead of bouncing it. Passers-by stopped, expecting concrete, maybe soapstone, only to learn the surface was **Absolute Black granite—honed to a velvety matte**. The buzz grew: *“Isn’t granite dead?”* Others whispered *“Thought everything was quartz now.”* Yet trade show floors from IDS Toronto to KBIS Las Vegas are filled with **honed and leathered granites**. Industry watchers call it Granite 2.0—natural, low-sheen, often deep-textured. The post below unpacks why the finish is back, the hard truths on upkeep, and exactly where Ontario homeowners can touch slabs before they swipe a credit card.

# What exactly counts as “matte granite”? Finishes decoded

|Finish|Look/Feel|Process|Typical Ontario stock names|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Honed**|Smooth, low-gloss, velvet touch|Abrasive grind stops before buffing|Absolute Black, White Ice|
|**Leathered (brushed)**|Low-sheen + subtle undulations; hides smudges|Diamond brushes follow honing|Titanium, Black Mist, Elegant Grey|
|**Flamed/thermal**|Rough, antiqued, outdoor vibe|High heat spalls crystals|Often exterior pavers, rare in kitchens|

MSI Surfaces warns honed granite is a bit more porous than polished, demanding stricter sealing cadence. [MSI Surfaces](https://www.msisurfaces.com/blogs/post/2019/02/06/comparing-polished-honed-and-leathered-granite-countertop-finishes.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# Pros & cons—no stone-seller fluff

# A) Pros

1. **Glare-free aesthetics** Works with under-cabinet LEDs, open shelving styling, and photography.
2. **Tactile luxury** Leathered textures feel like suede, elevating otherwise simple slabs.
3. **Camouflages fingerprints & crumbs** Micro-pits scatter light, unlike polished black that displays every smudge.
4. **Heat & scratch resistance unchanged** Finish doesn’t alter granite’s Mohs hardness.
5. **Sustainability talking point** Natural, VOC-free, and (unlike some sintered stones) recyclable.

# B) Cons

1. **Higher maintenance**
   * Honed requires **annual—sometimes semi-annual—sealing** to block oil stains (MSI advisory). [MSI Surfaces](https://www.msisurfaces.com/blogs/post/2019/02/06/comparing-polished-honed-and-leathered-granite-countertop-finishes.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
   * Acidic etching shows faster on honed blacks.
2. **Limited colour palette in stock** Ontario yards carry fewer SKUs; expect to preorder exotic honed whites.
3. **Price premium** Leathering adds machining time; some yards charge a mid-tier “exotic finish” up-charge.
4. **DIY scratch repair tricky** You can’t spot-buff a matte patch without leaving a halo, unlike polished where a diamond pad can blend.
5. **Myth-busting** Matte ≠ “sealed forever.” Consumers still need trivets and mild soap—coffee rings happen.

**Tip:** call ahead—many yards keep honed slabs vertical in indoor racks to protect finish oils; walk-ins sometimes only see 30 × 30 cm samples.

# Specifying the finish—checklist before you sign

1. **Slab ID printed on contract** Write “Honed” or “Leather” on each slab line to avoid “warehouse swap” for polished.
2. **Ask about** ***factory*** **vs** ***in-house*** **finish** Factory-honed surfaces arrive pre-sealed, more consistent; yard-side honing sometimes leaves swirl marks.
3. **Sealant brand & schedule in warranty** Better shops list Dry-Treat, Tenax or Lithofin products and first reseal date.
4. **Edge profile** Ogee or waterfall edges can look chalky on honed dark stone; eased or pencil edges hide seams.
5. **Lighting tests** Bring your own LED puck to slab gallery—different kelvin temps shift honed colour.

# Maintenance myth vs reality

|Task|Frequency|Pro tip|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Seal with penetrating sealer|6–12 months|Darken stone slightly? buff with white pad 30 min after.|
|Clean daily|As needed|pH-neutral stone soap. Skip vinegar.|
|Remove oil stain|Within hours|Poultice paste; honed absorbs faster but releases with clay poultice.|
|Refresh texture (leather)|5+ years|Light diamond-brush rehone by fabricator; not DIY.|

# Alternatives if matte granite still scares you

* **Leathered quartzite**: similar look, denser, pricier.
* **Concrete with micro-topping**: seamless matte but needs yearly wax.
* **Ultra-matte quartz lines**: Cambria “Concrete” finish or Caesarstone Natural finish—no sealing, but lacks authentic crystal movement.

MSI blog notes quartz “muted satin” finish suits rustic vibes, yet granite offers unmatched natural variation. [MSI Surfaces](https://www.msisurfaces.com/blogs/post/2024/08/12/current-obsessions-quartz-vs-granite-for-countertops.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# Cost snapshot (no legal-trouble numbers)

Most Ontario yards price honed/leathered **5–15 % higher** than the same colour polished, due to tooling and slower production. Leathered exotic blacks can drift into the mid-premium price tier but still beat Dekton or porcelain slabs. Always compare *installed* quotes—including templating, sink-cut, faucet holes—across suppliers.

# Designer verdict—when matte granite shines

* **Industrial lofts** needing tactile contrast to exposed steel.
* **Modern-farmhouse renos** where polished would feel “builder basic.”
* **Low-light basements** (legal suites from last post!)—glare control.
* **Open shelves with spotlighting**—matte counters keep focus on dishware.

But polished granite may still win in **small kitchens craving light bounce** or where maintenance discipline is low.

# Crowd counter-points?

* Has anyone battled oil ring ghosts on honed Absolute Black?
* Do nano-sealants really stretch reseal cycles beyond a year?
* Favourite Ontario yard for exotic matte whites?

I am so confused and conflicted right now. Me (21) and my boyfriend (21) have been together for almost three years. We moved in together after 9 months and mostly everything was amazing. Throughout the the first year I had found out that he lied to me about being addicted to coke. (He would call me and tell me he relapsed and I would be leaving work and crying on the phone and trying to help him the best I could) all while this was literally not true and he has never even tried it. Then I found out he lied to me about being SA by his boss (I am a victim of sa myself from a past relationship which he has never taken seriously. He told me in detail what happened and then proceeded to act afraid to go back to work. I was worried sick and did everything I could to help him yet again.) none of what he told me was true. I don’t know how I overlooked that and forgave him but hey I was 18 and felt very in love. 

For the first 2 years of us being together we did not argue one time other than when he lied. Then right around our 2nd anniversary something changed, he began to pull back and get really distant and start sleeping on the couch and saying rude comments to me about my looks or commenting on my weight knowing I struggle with an eating disorder and have for years. 

He also has a coworker who he told me someone else he works with called her his “work-girlfriend”. He would bring her up almost every single day, I got to the point where I told him it makes me so uncomfortable and he said sorry and still nothing changed. He also follows all of her instagram accounts and would buy her coffee everyday and when I told him that feels like I am being emotionally cheated on he said that I am over reacting and after our first “big fight” he finally caved and instead of unfollowing her, he made a new instagram account and deleted all of their messages after I asked to see them. I am aware that I was not being the best in that situation and I acknowledge that. 

Fast forward to a few months later, he quits his job and follows her on his new accounts and when I asked why, he said “she asked me to” and I told him that it felt so disrespectful that she asked him to do that and he did it so easily versus me begging and crying and for him to say that he wants to take a break so he could get out of that situation. We have bickered almost everyday for the last few months and I can’t take it any more. 

I feel so unloved and dismissed and also I do all the cleaning and cooking (he refuses to learn) he uses weaponized incompetence all the time and I feel like I am going insane. He also is very lovey dovey sometimes and tells me that he doesn’t know what he’d do without me etc. 

Also (NSFW) he has not made me cum once in three years and he keeps pressuring me to do something in bed that I don’t want to do. I thought I broke up with him the other day, but he is now acting like nothing happened at all and had no reaction.  So I have gone along with it out of confusion and hope for change that probably won’t happen. 

He also cannot communicate at all. Will not cry. Will not tell me how he’s feeling no matter what which is very difficult for me to handle. I am very big on communication and I have a lot of Feelings that I like to share. Thinking about us getting married and having a family which I have done for years makes it very difficult for me to leave. I feel so lost and so confused. I don’t have too many friends so this would be losing a best friend as well. I think I know what I need to do, but I am so stuck and so scared that I will regret my decision.",1,1748027292.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

My Apartment Complex is Threatening Fines,"Oh man, I feel you! My complex hit me with a warning letter last month. Here's what I found works in Atlanta:

**For home/apartment cooking:**

* **Grease Connection** \- They're my go-to. Super reliable and they handle both residential pickups if you have a decent amount saved up. No hassle at all.
* Let it solidify and toss in regular trash (mix with cat litter or coffee grounds to speed it up)
* Some recycling centers around metro Atlanta accept it - check your county's website
* Never ever EVER pour it down the drain - that's how you get those fines!

**If you're doing commercial-level cooking at home (like meal prep business):**

* Grease Connection handles this too - they're set up for regular pickups
* Clean Energy Biofuels - they're everywhere in Atlanta and even pay rebates sometimes
* Atlanta Hood Cleaning Services - they provide manifests for inspections which helps with apartment management
* Mahoney Environmental - they have heated outdoor containers if you need that

Pro tip from experience: Start collecting in an old coffee can or jar NOW. Most apartment complexes in Atlanta are cracking down because of the city's FOG (Fats, Oils, Grease) ordinances. The fines are no joke - my neighbor got hit with $500 for repeated violations.

Also, fun fact - all these companies turn your old oil into biodiesel! So you're actually helping the environment instead of clogging up Atlanta's already stressed sewer system.

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/iaMgO58MQQb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

I’m planning to relocate to Malta this October for a long-term stay as I’ll be working in Qormi. I'm super excited, but I could really use some up-to-date advice as most of the content I’ve come across (videos/articles) is from around 3 years ago and might not reflect the current reality.

Here’s what I’m hoping to get some help with:

1. Accommodation Advice:
How can I find a place to stay, is there any specific groups or websites to search on them? I’d love to find a place close to the sea, but still within a reasonable commute to Qormi.
My budget isn’t huge, so I'm trying to balance affordability, convenience, and a decent quality of life. Which areas would you recommend that are budget-friendly, safe, and possibly scenic or lively?


2. Cost of Living & Bills:
How much should I realistically expect to spend monthly (rent, utilities, groceries, mobile/internet, etc.)?

What’s the average cost of eating out, grabbing coffee, or public transport?


3. Transport & Commute Tips:
Is public transport reliable for getting to Qormi from coastal areas like Sliema, St. Julian’s, or others?
Would you recommend renting a car, or is it better to rely on buses and Bolt/Cab services?


4. Saving Money:
Any hacks or insider tips on saving money in Malta—whether it’s shopping, commuting, or eating out?
Are there specific supermarkets, apps, or services that locals rely on for better deals?

Anything I should know culturally or practically as a newcomer to make the transition smoother?
How’s the expat community? Are there any meetups or online groups worth joining?
I’d really appreciate any tips, personal experiences, or updated insights from anyone living in Malta right now. Thank you so much in advance!

Time for some unfiltered reality. We've all endured the excruciating pirouette of public life, punctuated by those exquisitely annoying social behaviors that make you want to scream in front of someone's face. And let's not pretend: you've likely committed at least one of these heinous social infractions yourself. This isn't about judgment from on high; it's about recalibrating our collective social souls. Because despite the performers' best efforts at ""subtlety,"" people are perfectly capable of critical thinking. We see through the charade. We know exactly what you're doing. And no, you're not fooling us.

**25 Public Behaviors Decoded: The Irritating Truth**

**1. The Overly Enthusiastic Newbie:** (Performative eagerness to impress, often to the point of absurdity). This is the performatively eager individual who leaps at opportunities, often before they're fully announced, and goes to exaggerated lengths to display their dedication, aiming to be seen as exceptionally committed.

* *Example:* At the new job orientation, before the HR manager even finishes explaining the volunteer sign-up sheet, they've already scrawled their name down for every committee. By lunch break, they're loudly announcing their intention to ""power through"" without eating, and in the afternoon, they're sending group emails offering to swap shifts, unasked, with anyone who looks remotely tired.

**2.  The Unfinished Degree Dropper:** (Using nascent academic enrollment as a premature badge of elite status). This is the ""currently in college"" bragger who uses mere enrollment in college, often in basic general education courses, as a **badge of immediate intellectual or social elite status**, implying that getting accepted is equivalent to actual academic achievement or graduation.

* *Example:* Mid-conversation about literally anything, they'll clear their throat and declare, ""As we're discussing in my *Intro to Psychology* class this semester at State University..."" or ""My *Foundations of Western Civilization* professor just lectured on this..."" implying their current enrollment in a basic general education course automatically grants them **superior, unchallenged insight** into the topic at hand.

**3.  The Overt Brand Display:** (Flagrant exhibition of luxury brands for overt status signaling). Wearing clothing or accessories with **prominently visible branding**, or meticulously positioning items like purses, hats, and shopping bags so their logos are constantly facing outward, explicitly using their attire and possessions as a public billboard for perceived wealth or status.

* *Example:* They show up to a quiet coffee shop draped in garments featuring large, unmistakable logos, then precisely arrange their designer handbag and branded coffee cup on the table, ensuring every visible emblem is perfectly angled towards onlookers.

**4.  The Foreigner Card-Player:** (Leveraging nominal foreign origin for perceived uniqueness or superior insight). This individual, often indistinguishable from locals and perhaps having lived in the country since childhood, continually interjects or emphasizes their ""otherness"" and origin from another country. This is done to subtly feel special, garner extra attention, or imply a unique perspective, even when context makes it irrelevant.

* *Example:* During a discussion about local school taxes, they might dramatically sigh and say, ""Well, in *my* country, we do things differently, you know,"" despite having attended American schools since age five, subtly positioning themselves as a more worldly authority.

**5.  The Proximity Invader:** (Blatant disregard for personal space and shared communal comfort). Violates fundamental personal boundaries and communal space, making people feel uncomfortable and disregarded in public settings.

* *Example:* On a crowded subway train, a man deliberately spreads his legs as wide as his **hips** could possibly allow, creating a gaping, impassable cavern of wasted space. He remains utterly oblivious to the new public service ads plastered just above his head, politely urging, **""Dude, Stop the Spread.""**

**6.  The Conversational Black Hole:** (Monopolizing discourse to the utter exclusion and exhaustion of others). A complete disregard for others' presence and participation in a group setting, effectively silencing everyone else. This individual talks non-stop, often about themselves, rarely pausing for breath, questions, or any indication of another person's sentience.

* *Example:* In a group of five, one person launches into an uninterrupted 45-minute monologue, eyes gleaming with self-importance, reminiscent of a meth-wired Hitler holding Mussolini captive with his own relentless, unhinged pronouncements. The other four are left exchanging frustrated, defeated glances, **longing for the sweet release of a life-ending asteroid impact.**

**7.  The Performative Public Scholar:** (Exaggerated public display of academic diligence for perceived intellectual superiority). Intentionally studying in highly visible public locations (like busy cafes, libraries, or parks) with an exaggerated array of open textbooks, scattered notes, and ostentatious highlighting. This display is often accompanied by **multitasking on a loud video call and frenzied laptop typing**, all designed to project a highly exaggerated image of intense intellectualism, superior academic diligence, and **feigned overworked importance**.

* *Example:* At a bustling coffee shop, they've commandeered a four-person table, surrounded by an impenetrable fortress of thick tomes, multiple brightly colored highlighters, and earnest, scribbled notes. They're simultaneously engaged in a loud video call, dramatically gesturing while typing furiously on their laptop, all while conspicuously groaning or sighing to signal the sheer mental exertion of their ""deep"" studies and ""insane workload.""

**8.  The Loud Speakerphone User:** (Blatant disregard for public peace via forced eavesdropping and performative business jargon). A gross violation of public peace and personal space, forcing unwilling eavesdropping on often mundane or private conversations. This individual frequently conducts calls on speakerphone, sometimes discussing deliberately vague or ambiguous ""business"" matters to feign importance and ensure everyone within earshot is acutely aware of their ""busy"" and ""vital"" life.

* *Example:* In a quiet café, they conduct a full, shouted speakerphone conversation, dropping phrases like ""**The fiscal third quarter synergy projections are really critical for this pivot**,"" or ""We need to operationalize that strategic paradigm shift ASAP,"" ensuring everyone assumes they're a high-stakes executive, even if they're just arranging an Amazon Fresh grocery delivery.

**9.  The Performative Worker (Community Edition):** (Divisive and judgmental self-aggrandizement based on minimal employment). In communities where public assistance or disability is common, this individual loudly and frequently announces their employment status (""I work,"" ""I got a job"") as a means to differentiate themselves and imply moral superiority over others. This often occurs even if their actual job is only for minimal hours, solely to meet the requirements for maintaining their own public benefits.

* *Example:* At the local community center, they'll lean back, cross their arms, and loudly declare, ""**At least** ***I*** **work for a living**, unlike some people who just sit around collecting checks."" Their pronouncement is made with a knowing glance at those around them, despite their own job being a ten-hour-a-week gig designed to fulfill welfare requirements.

**10.  The False Humility Bragger:** (Concealing boastful self-promotion behind a façade of modesty). Initiates a seemingly self-deprecating comment that is, in fact, a thinly veiled attempt to highlight an impressive achievement or quality, fishing for compliments and admiration.

* *Example:* ""Ugh, I'm just so bad at relaxing. Like, I *literally* can't sit still, even on vacation, because my brain is always just, like, *go, go, go* with new business ideas.""

**11.  The Constant Comparer:** (Relentlessly steering conversations into competitive one-upsmanship). Relentlessly steers conversations towards their own experiences, attempting to one-up or overshadow others' anecdotes, effectively making every discussion a competition they must win.

* *Example:* When a friend mentions a minor travel delay, they interject, ""Oh, that's nothing! On my trip to Bali, our plane was grounded for 36 hours, and I lost my passport, luggage, *and* my will to live!""

**12.  The Unsolicited Advice-Giver:** (Imposing unwanted opinions and pseudo-expertise to assert authority). Dispenses unwanted opinions and guidance on topics they may know little about, often interrupting or overriding others' conversations, purely to assert their perceived expertise or authority.

* *Example:* Overhearing a couple discussing kitchen renovations, they loudly interject, ""Oh, you simply *must* get quartz countertops. Granite is *so* last decade, and frankly, if you don't gut your entire plumbing system, you're just throwing money away.""

**13.  The Performative Empath:** (Exaggerated emotional displays to signal superior virtue and sensitivity). Offers highly exaggerated or overly public displays of sympathy and understanding, often disproportionate to the situation, primarily to draw attention to their own virtuousness and emotional depth.

* *Example:* At a charity event, upon hearing a moderately sad story, they visibly wince, clutch their chest, and exclaim, ""Oh, my *heart*! I feel your pain on a cosmic level! Truly, I am just *so* overwhelmed by the sheer humanity of it all!""

**14.  The Pseudo-Intellectual Jargon Spouter:** (Employing arcane vocabulary to feign intellectual superiority and condescend). Deliberately uses obscure or overly academic terminology in everyday conversation, not to clarify, but to intimidate, condescend, or simply project an image of superior intellect.

* *Example:* Instead of saying ""they're not communicating well,"" they muse, ""Their interpersonal synergy lacks ontological coherence, leading to a breakdown in semiotic exchange.""

**15.  The Perpetual Victim:** (Manipulating minor inconveniences into grand narratives of personal suffering). Consistently frames every minor setback, inconvenience, or perceived slight as a catastrophic personal attack, demanding endless sympathy and absolving themselves of any responsibility.

* *Example:* Spills a single drop of coffee on their shirt and loudly wails, ""Of course this would happen to *me*! My life is just a never-ending series of cruel, cosmic injustices! Why does the universe conspire against me?!""

**16.  The One-Upper:** (Systematically invalidating others' experiences through exaggerated personal anecdotes). Not content with a shared experience, they must always present a story that is more extreme, more impressive, or more tragic than yours, subtly diminishing your contribution to the conversation.

* *Example:* If you mention a headache, they immediately counter with, ""A headache? Honey, I get migraines that make me hallucinate medieval tapestries. You have *no idea* what real pain is.""

**17.  The Conversational Hijacker:** (Rudely diverting conversations to self-serving or irrelevant personal obsessions). Abruptly redirects any discussion, regardless of its relevance, to their own pet topic or current obsession, completely derailing the original flow of dialogue.

* *Example:* Mid-discussion about upcoming local elections, they suddenly interject, ""Speaking of civic duty, have you tried my new gluten-free sourdough starter? It's really revolutionized my gut microbiome!""

**18.  The Tokenizer:** (Reducing individuals to stereotypical identity labels for shallow engagement). Reduces individuals to their single most prominent identity characteristic (e.g., race, gender, profession) and then uses that as their sole frame of reference or point of engagement.

* *Example:* Upon meeting an Asian person, they immediately exclaim, ""Oh, I just *love* sushi! Do you make your own?"" or, ""My cousin is also an engineer!""

**19.  The Echo Chamber Enthusiast:** (Seeking only affirmation for existing beliefs, hostile to any intellectual challenge). Engages in discussions solely to find validation for their pre-existing beliefs, dismissing or becoming visibly agitated by any dissenting viewpoints, regardless of supporting evidence.

* *Example:* During a spirited debate about a political issue, they nod furiously only when someone agrees with them, then visibly cross their arms and roll their eyes whenever a counter-argument is presented, muttering, ""Typical.""

**20.  The Public Groomer:** (Performing intimate personal hygiene in shared spaces with complete disregard). Engaging in extensive personal grooming (e.g., flossing teeth, clipping nails, excessively styling hair) in public or semi-public spaces like cafes, lobbies, or public transport, without regard for others' discomfort.

* *Example:* On a crowded train, they pull out a full nail clipper set and proceed to meticulously trim their toenails, allowing the **crescent-shaped keratin confetti to steadily pile up** on the floor around their feet.

**21.  The Compliment Deflector/Demolisher:** (Turning sincere praise into a self-deprecating bid for further validation). Responds to a genuine compliment by immediately refuting it, downplaying their achievement, or even turning it into a self-deprecating fishing expedition, forcing the complimenter to re-praise.

* *Example:* ""Your presentation was brilliant!"" ""Oh, this old thing? No, I barely slept, and I think I mispronounced half the words. Honestly, it was a disaster. Are you sure you even *listened*?""

**22.  The Performative Flexer:** (Exaggerated public posturing to ostentatiously display physical attributes). In public settings, strategically contorting their body or performing seemingly innocuous actions (like leaning, stretching, or adjusting clothing) in exaggerated ways, solely to highlight their muscularity or physique, even when their tight, revealing attire leaves no ambiguity.

* *Example:* While waiting for coffee, they'll dramatically lean against the counter, then slowly and **with excessive effort**, stretch to adjust the three buttons on their short-sleeved polo shirt, holding the pose for an unnatural beat to ensure their bicep is maximally tensed and on full display.

**23.  The False Busy-Bee:** (Feigning perpetual overwhelming busyness to imply importance and garner sympathy). Constantly talks about being ""swamped,"" ""slammed,"" or ""overwhelmed"" with commitments, even if their actual workload is minimal, primarily to imply a demanding, important life and garner sympathy or admiration.

* *Example:* ""Ugh, I'm just *so* slammed this week. I barely have time to breathe! I have, like, three emails to answer and a coffee date. My life is just *crazy*!""

**24.  The Auditory Tyrant:** (Blasting personal media in public with aggressive disregard for shared peace). This individual blasts music, videos, or loud phone calls from their device's speakers in shared public spaces – be it on public transit, in a park, or a waiting room – forcing everyone within earshot to be unwilling, captive audiences to their personal media. It's a blatant, aggressive disregard for the collective peace and a pure distillation of selfish entitlement.

* *Example:* On a quiet morning subway commute, a person settles in and, with a vacant stare, proceeds to play a TikTok compilation at maximum volume, treating the entire train car as their personal, inescapable entertainment lounge.

**25.  The Unsanitary Public Transit Bum:** (The undisputed sovereign of public torment, inflicting unavoidable sensory assault). This individual boards public transport completely devoid of basic hygiene, radiating an inescapable, noxious cloud of body odor – the distinct, putrid blend of **dirty ass, onion-like sweat, and feet that smell like a garbage truck**. This already agonizing experience is then grotesquely compounded when they proceed to openly smoke illicit substances, like crack, their senses utterly deadened to the repugnant stench they impose. Passengers are left gagging, trapped and forced to inhale this vile, toxic atmospheric assault, with no immediate escape other than **impulsive self-termination**.

What genuinely resonates, long after the moment passes, is the profound disconnect between the individual's self-perception and the glaring reality for everyone else. Whether driven by blatant show-off intent, a misguided belief in their own subtlety, or simply a **callous disregard for shared space and human decency**, these public behaviors are never truly subtle. Every calculated pretense, every veiled boast, every outright imposition, only serves to expose the perpetrator's thoughtlessness. So, let this list be a collective nod of recognition for those of us who consistently see and feel the impact of these charades. Your actions, dear public practitioners, are rarely as invisible as you think.",1,1748026390.0,Unstyle,0,1.0,False

I’m planning to spend around 3 months in LA this summer and want to fully experience what it’s like to live as an American. It might sound silly, but I have been dreaming of that since I was a kid!

Background: I’m 26M, a freelance creative (web development, content creation, social media management) from Budapest, Hungary. 

I would love to make the most of my time there—both personally and professionally. I’d really appreciate any advice, local insights, or even random tips to help me get settled and enjoy the city like a local.

I have quite a lot of questions, but if you could answer just 1 or 2, I would be very very grateful!

Here are some things I’m curious about:

Summer Life in LA

– What’s life like in LA during the summer? How does it compare to the rest of the year?
– Is there anything that surprised you about LA summers when you first moved here?
– Any unspoken rules or “only in LA” habits to know about?

Housing

– How realistic is it to find a short-term rental (2–3 months) that’s not outrageously expensive?
– Are there particular neighborhoods you’d recommend for someone without a car?
– Any platforms or communities you trust for finding sublets (without getting scammed)?

Transportation

– What are some realistic alternatives to driving/public transport? (e.g., bikes, scooters?)
– Which areas are genuinely walkable or bikeable for daily errands, coffee runs, etc.?
– Any underrated apps that make getting around LA easier?

Sports & Fitness

– Good gyms or studios that offer short-term memberships or day passes? Alternative: Best public places for calisthenics/bodyweight workouts?
– Favorite places to run in LA during summer that aren’t overly crowded or scorching?
– Beginner-friendly spots to try out tennis or surfing?

Networking

– Where do creatives (content creators, musicians, designers) usually hang out or connect?
– Any events, cafes, or coworking spaces where it’s easy to meet like-minded people?
– Is it common to reach out to people via IG or online before meeting up IRL?

Singing & music

– Any great vocal coaches for beginners who focus on modern/pop styles?

Cafes

– What are your go-to cafes for working?And for just relaxing?
– Any cafes with a creative vibe you’d recommend?

Free time

– What’s your ideal “classic LA” Sunday in the summer?
– Best hiking destinations within 3-4 hours of travel?

Any tips—big or small—are super appreciated. Thanks so much in advance 🙌",2,1748026327.0,AskLosAngeles,4,1.0,False
1ktrf6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ktrf6s/asking_for_a_miracle_eosinophilic_colitis/,Asking for a miracle - Eosinophilic colitis,"62M, 172 cm, 80 kg, caucasian, chronic colitis for over 15 years...

All mandatory background information is at the bottom of this post:

Expat living in Madagascar so I have limited access to sophisticated diagnostics or care, or meds.  But, we do have a Pasteur Institute, so, we have good laboratory services.

Over 15 years of intermittent chronic diarrhea.  Did a colonoscopy abroad probably 10 years ago, nothing remarkable, no diagnosis.  Told to take Imodium when required.  Asked so many doctors, in Madagascar, in Australia, in the UK, in South Africa, most say ""take a blood test"".  Most blood tests indicate raised eosinophils, so everyone then says, ""Oh, you've got worms, take some zoles to clear yourself out"".  About 4 years ago, I went to a professor of gastroenterology in Antananarivo at one of the university hospitals, who did a colonoscopy and a gastroscopy, and the result from the Pasteur Institute was as follows (translated from the French):

HISTOLOGICAL EXAMINATION:

Duodenal biopsy: This is a biopsy of the duodenal mucosa with villi of normal height. The glands are mucus-secreting, and the lamina propria contains plasma cells and lymphocytes. No villous atrophy or histological signs of malignancy were found within the limits of the specimen.

Gastric biopsy: These are biopsies of the fundic mucosa with mucus-secreting infundibulum and crypts. The lamina propria is devoid of inflammatory reaction. GIEMSA staining for Helicobacter pylori and related bacteria is negative. No intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, or cell proliferation suspicious for malignancy was found within the limits of the specimen.

Colonic biopsy: These are biopsies of the colonic mucosa. The architecture is well preserved, and the crypts and infundibulum are mucus-secreting. The lamina propria is the site of a moderate inflammatory infiltrate with a predominance of lymphocytes, plasma cells, **and eosinophils**. No signs of microscopic colitis were found (intraepithelial lymphocytes were not increased; there was no collagenous colitis).

Ileal biopsy: These are biopsies with mucus-secreting infundibula and crypts. A lymphoid follicle and a moderate inflammatory lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate were observed in the lamina propria. The villi and crypts are of normal and regular height. No pathogen or histological signs of malignancy were found.

CONCLUSION:  
NORMAL DUODENAL BIOPSY.   
GASTRIC BIOPSIES: NORMAL   
STAGED COLIC BIOPSY: NON-SPECIFIC CHRONIC INFLAMMATION.  
ILEAL BIOPSY: NON-SPECIFIC CHRONIC INFLAMMATION.

No treatment or further action prescribed. 

This year, it got so bad, such terrible diarrhea, through the night, waking me multiple times a night.  I can count on one hand the number of times I have been woken by diarrhea previously in my life, but this last year, it is off the charts. Every single night, I have not had uninterrupted sleep for months. I am often unable to attend my job, cramps, pains, exhaustion, but mainly, just pooing all the time, sudden onset, unable to hold it for long, it's really like - cramp, rumble, oops, it's now or never.  I went to another gastroenterologist in Antananarivo in February this year, and he didn't even look at me; he just said, ""You have irritable bowel"".  He prescribed Imodium and two different drugs to slow transit, told me to avoid fruit, juice, and a few other things, and said to come back in a month.  I took his drugs, nothing changed, and I went back in a month, but not to him. I went to my GP, a professor in internal medicine at the university hospital, and he sent me to another guy, but he called him and talked to him about my case, and he sent me for every test possible.  I had a CT of chest and abdomen (nothing notable), bloods (nothing notable apart from high MCHC, and surprise surprise high eosinophils), stool test and culture (nothing and no parasites), urine culture (nothing), and another colonoscopy.  The results of the colonoscopy said that there was abrasion/erosion of the intestine from unknown causes, and severe chronic inflammation of unknown cause. This time, I asked that the biopsies be sent to the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and not dealt with locally.  The results came back as follows (translated from the French).

MACROSCOPY OF 03/17/2025

We were sent a bottle bearing the name of Mr. John Doe. It contains seven biopsies of 1 to 2 mm. They are included in their entirety in a block and studied on three slice levels.  
HISTOLOGICAL EXAMINATION:  
The surface epithelial coating is abraded. There is a slight architectural distortion of the crypts and glands. The lamina propria is the site of a superficial inflammatory infiltrate of the lymphoplasmacytic type with a large number of eosinophilic polymorphonuclear cells. No parasites, epithelioid granulomas, or basal plasmacytosis were observed. Focally, we observe images of eosinophilic cryptitis with foci of crypt abscess.  
No malignancy.  
CONCLUSION:  
COLIC MUCOUS MEMBRANE – BIOPSY: HISTOLOGICAL ASPECT OF EOSINOPHILIC COLITIS.

OK, so that was in March.  Nothing changed for a while. I tried removing a few things from my diet, but I confess I was not very serious about that.  I read about doing serious diets where I remove **everything** from my diet and see what happens, and then add things back one by one... My diet is, by default, unprocessed and mainly organic fruit, vegetables, beef, poultry, and fish.  I do eat locally-made preservative-free bread (often) and pasta.  I have milk in coffee every morning and eat limited amounts of locally-made cheese.

But then it went into remission for a while, and since mid-April, I was lulled into a false sense of security that things were on the mend.  Suddenly, oops, it's back, worse than ever.  All day yesterday (I had to stay off work) and last night, I was in the toilet every 15 minutes all day and night (it's never very much, a quick squirt and it's over), and by this morning, there was blood mixed with my stool.  

Here are a couple of things that are remarkable to me, but maybe coincidental and irrelevant:

1. Lately, flare-ups have been preceded by some type of allergy-like event.  Just before the previous flare-up, I had a thing where I became itchy, and my entire lower back erupted in itchy welts, like hives, for no apparent reason.  I took an antihistamine, rubbed a steroid cream on it, and it went away within 24 hours.  A few days later, my bowels went nuts.  This latest time, I had a similar thing on my face under my eye last week, itchy spots flared up, then my face swelled up and I had a big lump under my eye, again, antihistamines and a tickle with some steroid cream, and it took about two days to go down.  A few days later, this current attack happened.

2. HIV + since December 2016 and undetectable since March 2017.  I have super-high CD4 levels.  Ever since my HIV diagnosis, I have tested my viral load and CD4s every 6 months.  My viral load has been undetectable since a few months after my diagnosis, and strangely, in 2020, I did a test and the result was negative (but I guess that's just a way of expression in reporting, or an error).  My CD4 level was already at around 1,200 when I was first diagnosed, but within 6 months on ARVs, it went to 1,800 and has stayed there, between 1,750 and 1,800 constantly.

Other background health issues, severe arthritic stenosis in Cs (all of them) and Ls (all of them), but treated by CT-guided steroid injections (outside Madagascar) every 3 or 4 years.  I have oxycodone in stock for emergencies (I take perhaps one or two 10mg tablets twice per year) and 40 mg codeine tablets, which I take on demand if I get too uncomfortable, perhaps twice a week.  I do not drink, no recreational drugs, ex-smoker.  I have no other significant health issues, i.e., normal BP, normal cholesterol, never had heart issues, or kidney issues, and take no other medication regularly, except ARVs.  My ARV is Viropil, which is Dolutegravir + Lamivudine + Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Maybe worth remembering that the tummy problems started well in advance of the HIV or ARVs.  Never had any psychological illness suspected, accused, or diagnosed. 

My local doctor here is, I think, kind of fatigued and bamboozled by the situation, and has an aversion to prescribing me steroids, which seem to be the only things, from what I have read, that may help this type of colitis.  I think the reaction is reasonable because of my age and our inability to really monitor the potential effects of long-term steroid use here, where I live.  So, I am stuck with:

* Smecta (Diosmectite - powdered clay)
* No spa (Drotaverine hydrochloride)
* Imodium (Loperamide)
* Oh, and if I remember to take it, I take a fibre supplement (Metamucil) and that helps; it at least makes the stools less liquid and less frequent.
* And that's it...

Comments would be very welcome.  It's a long shot.  But you know, even if I go abroad to seek treatment, how on earth do I find someone with experience with this condition?  From what I have read, there are very few studies, not enough data, not enough subjects, and no standard protocols... Where do I go from here?

For context my (31 M) ex (26F) ended things between us in October 2024. And for the last 2 months we had been in no contact. Yesterday she saw me at the gym and came to say hi and catch up a little bit, at the end of our convo while saying goodbye I told her that was really nice seeing her and that maybe one day we could have some coffee. 30 minutes later I revived a text and well we had some coffee. 

She told me about her feeling that she is self sabotaging in all the relationships, that she haven’t been able to heal from relationships because she jumps into another just to numb herself. I told her that what she says it aligns with an avoidant tendency, at least for what I had read online. She then proceeded to do a test and yeah now she is aware that have some avoidant tendencies. As well she said she wants to be alone for a year or whatever she needs to try to “fix” herself. 

She is now gonna start therapy, and literally bought a book to try to understand and reflect on the way she connects with people. 

I would lie if I say that I’m not having some sparks of hope on maybe one day rekindle things. But for now I know it’s a thing she needs to do on her own. And I need to continue on the path of my own healing. But I hope in a future we can reconnect from a much healthier stance. 

Let me know about your experiences and thank you all in advance for any information everything is well received. ",2,1748025940.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

Paralyzed by the fear that AI will make your dreams obsolete before you even start pursuing them? This isn't another gentle life coach that whispers sweet affirmations—this is a surgical-precision strategist that cuts through your mental fog with ruthless clarity.

This AI doesn't coddle your fears; it confronts them head-on.

Whether you're paralyzed by too many ideas or suffocated by career dread, this strategist will drag you out of indecision and into aligned action. Sometimes the most compassionate thing someone can do is refuse to enable your comfortable misery.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are a Brutally Honest Life Path Strategist AI, specializing in extracting people from the quicksand of indecision, career paralysis, and existential drift. Your mission is to provide surgical-precision clarity that cuts through mental fog, self-deception, and societal programming to reveal authentic direction. You do not coddle, sugarcoat, or enable comfortable misery—you confront reality with compassionate ruthlessness.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Before engaging with the user's specific situation, conduct a comprehensive psychological excavation using these phases:

**Phase 1: Reality Assessment**
- Identify the gap between their stated desires and actual behaviors
- Expose hidden fears masquerading as practical concerns
- Distinguish between genuine obstacles and self-imposed limitations

**Phase 2: Pattern Recognition**
- Map recurring themes in their decision-making paralysis
- Identify which ""opportunities"" are actually avoidance mechanisms
- Reveal the core conflict between safety and authenticity driving their confusion

**Phase 3: Surgical Intervention**
- Challenge assumptions about what's ""realistic"" or ""responsible""
- Reframe their relationship with risk, failure, and time scarcity
- Provide specific, actionable direction based on their authentic drivers

**Phase 4: Strategic Alignment**
- Design a hybrid path that honors both practical needs and deeper purpose
- Create immediate next steps that build momentum without requiring massive life upheaval
- Address AI-future concerns with concrete adaptation strategies
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Listen for what the user isn't saying—the fears beneath their stated problems
2. Identify the internal war between different aspects of their identity
3. Distinguish between their authentic voice and internalized external expectations
4. Map the cost of inaction against the perceived risks of action
5. Synthesize a direction that integrates rather than fragments their multifaceted nature
6. Translate insights into specific, momentum-building actions
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never provide generic advice or platitudes
- Do not enable victim mentality or learned helplessness

We are not super close but every now and then we grab coffee and catch up on work-industry stuff. Recently, she asked me to come work with her as a freelance-consultant. I was excited  but after a week I was concerned.  She seemed overwhelmed and disorganized but I gave her some grace. I began to notice how much she talked during the day, it was non-stop. The chatter was mostly in the morning-late afternoon. The work itself was not hard but I began to wonder how she had time to talk all day and not work since I was hired to help. I began to think she wasn't working at all.

Then after about a month they wanted to extend my contract but it was never discussed with me directly, only after the fact. The first time this happened she mentioned it to me and told me to take my time -no pressure, but then later that day when another co-worker asked if I would be in next week, before I could say anything my friend said ""Yes, she is extending with us another month.""  I didn't even say yes yet. I didn't call her out at that point but I was taken aback. Anyway, I needed the money and decided it was okay to extend. 

Then close to end of 2nd month it sort of happened again. They wanted me to stay longer and she mentioned it again after the fact. I also overheard her telling HR how is great having me because she gets to catch up on emails and take a break before working on her stuff end of the week. I was shocked! It felt like I was doing her work while she collected her 6 figure salary. Anyway, she approached me again to extend and told me to think about it, I was a little hesitant this time and told her I need to think about it cause I wanted to take a months break but I will let her know. after a day or so I decided to extend again but before I could talk to her she texted me, ""hey so I found someone else so now you can take your month off and didn't want you to think too much about deciding""... I was PISSED. she didn't even wait for me to say yes or no.

After I put things together, I think she hired me to do her work so she could focus on finishing up school  semester and collect her large salary, but why not just tel me that?

For reference, I am an international student and I am about to graduate from a RG London university with an LLB. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had some amazing moments; met lifelong friends, built a nice routine, explored the city. But it has also been some of the loneliest and most depressing years of my life. Contact hours were minimal and there’s not many chances to socialize with my course mates in class (everyone tends to stick to who they already know, or conversations rarely lead anywhere). Joining societies helped a little but never got me the uni friend group I’ve always wanted. Hanging out with new friends is always a ‘coffee date’ or drinks to catch up, scheduled days in advance. Everything is commercial law this, magic circle firm that, LinkedIn, coffee chat… you get the gist

Of course I know that university is what you make of the experience. But trust me when I say that I tried everything there is: I joined multiple societies (by interest and for my career), I took a class at another university, I went to sports nights and other events, I lived in halls, moved in with friends, joined dating apps, DMd people to become friends and many more ..

Especially with the way the legal job market is these days I am really starting to regret my decision. It’s unfortunate that we can only make this decision once. I feel like I was robbed of my university experience. I was considering applying to McGill University in Canada for law and now I wish I could just go back in time and do that instead. I’ve never seen people say a single bad thing about their experience there. Now I am considering pursuing a masters there but it would not be the same.

Of course I am grateful I have the opportunity to even study at university, live abroad. Please don’t get me wrong! I just needed to rant and I’m curious to see if anyone else is in the same position.

I'm soon making the first step to upgrade from a full automatic machine, as I want to actually have espressos and the weird mix of water with caffeine. Anyhow, after \_hours\_ of research online I have come across the Gaggia Classic E24 and the Bambino Plus as my 2 options. Budget is up to 500, location is NL.

For grinder, I have decided for a Eureka Mignon Specialita, it speaks to me and it looks like a great first grinder.

**Use case:** 1-2 coffees a day, mostly espressos in the morning. I can sacrifice some time making it allowing me around a 5-7 minute turnover time; the less the better, and the more 'press a button and do something else' is also a plus. I also sometimes make cappuccinos or lattes for guests, which is twice a week or so.

So my logic is the following:

**Bambino (450 euros):** Has the automatic frothing function, 30 seconds boot up time which are a plus and I also don't need to manually time it (from what I understood, I have to with the Gaggia one?). Also I can adjust the timing manually which is great, however I heard few weird things about the drip tray size and some other finer technical disadvantages [(see thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i5294t/newb_experience_gaggia_e24_vs_bambino_pus/)). However, it seems that the support seems to be quite good, and I can safely keep this for many years to come without needing to upgrade.

**Gaggia Classic E24 (460 euros):** Seems to be better overall quality including built. It has its own disadvantages (e.g small distance between porta filter etc) however the main aspect of it that makes me consider is gaggiuino mod. From the specification, with roughly an extra 200 bucks I can automate alot of processes, including setting the pre heating to turn on before I wake up through API access. I have engineering/tinkering experience so it seems a fun project to play around with and try. As I told my friends maybe try to add artificial intel in it. But idk if spending more money on this would mean that I could have easily spent it alltogether for a better machine?

So all in all, I'm stuck between the two because one seems to be more solid out of the box suitable to my needs, however the second one could be turned into something match more to match my case. Any advice welcome.

**Update:** Proud to say that I joined GCE and will be automating it. Thank you all for the support, and chatgpt supporting me with questions like ""why does grinder say 58 but not the machine"". See you soon!!!",1,1748025138.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

1ktqwfi,https://i.redd.it/mb16w6csrk2f1.jpeg,How Do I Claim the 2025 Ontario HST Reno Rebate on a Major Remodel (Step-by-Step)?,"# The tax-season face-palm that forced me to learn HST rules the hard way

Early this spring, while I was still basking in the dust-covered glory of a studs-to-shiplap remodel, a brown CRA envelope crashed the afterglow. Inside: a gentle reminder that my friend’d just paid tens of thousands of dollars in HST on labour, drywall, electrical, etc. His accountant’s response to his wounded yelp was, “Didn’t you know you can claw a chunk of that back under the Ontario new-housing/renovation rebate—if your reno counts as ‘substantial’?”

Cue panic-Google sessions, coffee-fuelled phone calls to CRA, and a crash course in Form **GST190**. Two months later he stuffed a tidy rebate package into the mail, and last week the refund landed. Here’s the step-by-step playbook that got him there—minus the migraines, plus the links you’ll actually need.

*(Primary references throughout: CRA guide RC4028* [*https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4028/gst-hst-new-housing-rebate.html*]()*, bulletin B-092 on substantial renovations* [*https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/b-092/substantial-renovations-gst-hst-new-housing-rebate.html*]()*, Manvir Basra rebate checklist* [*https://manvirbasra.com/real-estate-investor-playbook/gst-hst-new-housing-rebate-for-ontario-residents/*]()*, Rebate4U application tips* [*https://www.rebate4u.ca/rebate-blog/how-to-ensure-your-home-renovation-is-fully-eligible-for-the-hst-rebat/*]()*.)*

# Do you actually qualify? The “substantial renovation” test in plain English

# A) CRA’s 90 % rule (yes, it’s real)

A reno only qualifies if you gutted or replaced at least **90 % of the building’s interior “to the studs.”** Floors, drywall, plumbing rough-ins—it all counts. Merely swapping kitchens and bathrooms doesn’t cut it. CRA calls this a *“substantial renovation.”* See bulletin B-092 §3 [https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/b-092/substantial-renovations-gst-hst-new-housing-rebate.html]().

Practical tip: take timestamped photos of every room mid-demo. CRA likes visuals.

# B) Ownership matters

* **Owner-occupied single home** → use **Form GST190**.
* **Condo, co-op share, trailer** → still GST190 but with different sections.
* **Rental conversion** → different rebate (NRRP). This post sticks to principal-residence remodels.

# C) Land changes? Ignore them

Ontario’s rebate hinges on the fair-market value of house + land after reno, but the application is still one package.

# Paperwork arsenal—gather this before you touch the form

|Document|Why CRA wants it|
|:-|:-|
|**All original invoices** (labour & materials)|Proof you paid HST and didn’t pay cash. Must show supplier HST #.|
|**Proof of occupancy** (tax bill, utility)|Shows you actually live there post-reno.|
|**Purchase date of property**|Needed for FMV calculation.|
|**Photos / floorplans**|Evidence of 90 % interior removal if CRA audits.|
|**Appraisal or builder’s statement of FMV**|Used for line E of GST190 (see guide RC4028, section 3).|

Tip: I stuffed everything into a Dropbox folder *as soon* as my GC emailed an invoice. No late-night shoebox archaeology.

# Step-by-step: Filling Form GST190 (Ontario edition)

>

# Section A – Applicant Info

Self-explanatory. Watch spelling; CRA kicks back mismatched names.

# Section B – Location

Enter legal address exactly as on property-tax bill.

# Section C – Application Type

Check box A (“Owner of a substantial renovation”) if you hit the 90 % threshold.

# Section D – Total HST on renovations

Add HST from every invoice (yes, even that $12.43 plumbing fitting). For mixed-rate invoices, list only the HST portion.

# Section E – Fair-Market Value after reno

Grab appraisal or contractor letter. CRA guide example reminds you to include land value [Canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4028/gst-hst-new-housing-rebate.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

# Section F – Calculate federal rebate

Follow the guide table. Provincial part comes later.

# Section G – Ontario new-housing rebate

Multiply amount on line D by **5.31 %** (Ontario’s provincial portion). The guide caps the rebate at a fixed ceiling (check RC4028). Enter result on line F of Section G. Source: RC4028, lines F & H [https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4028/gst-hst-new-housing-rebate.html]().

# Sign and date

Blue-ink myth is gone—digital signatures accepted if using CRA MyAccount upload.

# Submission options & deadlines

|Path|How|Deadline|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**CRA MyAccount upload**|Scan PDFs, upload under “Submit documents”|**2 years**Within   of substantial-renovation completion (date of occupancy).|
|**Snail mail**|Send to Sudbury Tax Centre, rebate processing unit|Same 2-year window; use tracked mail.|

Manvir Basra blog emphasises the two-year rule [https://manvirbasra.com/real-estate-investor-playbook/gst-hst-new-housing-rebate-for-ontario-residents/]().

# Processing timeline & what to do if CRA wants more proof

* **CRA target**: 8–12 weeks (RC4028, FAQ).
* **Reality check**: Mine took 10 weeks; a friend’s package missing two receipts got an *NORS* letter asking for clarifications and took 4 additional weeks.

If CRA asks for detail, upload photos & contractor emails. “Substantial” is subjective—visuals close the debate.

# Common pitfalls that delay or kill your rebate

1. **Cash payments** (no HST on receipt) → ineligible.
2. **Kitchen-and-bath-only renos** → fail the 90 % test.
3. **Name mismatch** between utility bill and application.
4. **Invoices addressed to contractor, not homeowner**—ask subcontractors to reissue “care of” your name.

Rebate4U checklist covers more traps [https://www.rebate4u.ca/rebate-blog/how-to-ensure-your-home-renovation-is-fully-eligible-for-the-hst-rebat/]().

# Pairing the HST rebate with other 2025 incentives (stack wisely)

|Program|Stacks?|How it interacts|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Canada Greener Homes Loan**|✅|Rebate reduces project net cost; loan still based on invoices.|
|**HRSP 30 % energy rebate**|✅|HST rebate claim uses tax; HRSP uses pre-tax cost. Keep both invoice sets.|
|**Multigenerational Home Reno Tax Credit**|✅|Credit covers accessibility suite additions; doesn’t affect HST calculation lines.|

# His personal cost/benefit snapshot (no dollar spoilers)

* **Invoices HST total**: think compact-car money.
* **Ontario rebate (5.31 %)**: enough to buy upgraded black-stainless appliances.
* **Time invested**: one Saturday spreadsheet, two evenings filling GST190, one Dropbox upload.
* **ROI**: Under two weeks of effort for a five-figure cheque—worth every coffee.

# Crowd-source the nuances—your turn!

* Anyone beaten the 90 % rule with creative demo?
* Did CRA accept your realtor FMV letter or insist on a licensed appraiser?
* How long did the digital-upload path take vs snail mail?

i said to someone i was getting coffee with who got a coffee drinking it at the counter that it reminded me of espresso bars in italy. bc they were standing at the counter and drinking it from a tiny white cup. i'd never been to europe (and actually they had) but i knew of this.

they ignored me and i thought they didn't hear so i said it again but they snapped back saying it's just a regular coffee.

it's confusing for me bc i thought i clearly wasn't saying it's some fancy italian coffee. i just said that this reminds me of the espresso bars in italy. when i tried to explain myself that i knew it wasn't a regular coffee and that this scene simply reminded me of europe, they just sort of ignored it.

then later i tried to explain again (it really makes me anxious if someone walks away thinking i don't know what a regular cup of joe is) then them and the other people started talking about coffee in europe (which was what i imagined the convo was going to lead to at the beginning anyways?)

i'm not sure what i'm doing wrong. people tend to draw really different conclusions when i try to make small talk or act like i am making something complicated when i'm not. i'm not sure if it's autism or what.

i feel like i *do* understand the context of the situation, i *do* see a big picture, it's maybe like life is a lot of interesting, colorful big pictures and i like to see the parallels. i get it's a regular coffee but i have an imagination and see more.

I know that google (and Chat GPT) say ""red is for energy"" but our brand color is a greenish teal and I just don't vibe with the flash that comes with red/green (especially on kraft shippers).

I‘ve been wanting to buy a good espresso machine for a long time, but I'm finding it very difficult. I'm currently deciding between two machines:

1) ECM Classika PID
2) Bezzera BZ10

The Profitec Pro 400 was also recommended to me.

I drink straight espresso almost exclusively and would therefore opt for a single-circuit machine in the price range of the two mentioned machines [~1.500€]. There will be two people drinking coffee multiple times a day. 

My aim is to get a perfect thick espresso a la Italy.

I don't think you can go wrong with either machine, but perhaps someone can recommend one of the two from experience.

I am also aware of the importance of a good grinder and am prepared to spend some money [300-400€]. So far I had thought about the Eureka Specialita or Varia VS3. Does anyone have any experience with these two or can anyone recommend another good grinder?

Thank you very much for your support ❤️

We have been planning to hire a shuttle, and have been waffling between having my parents' friend's  college-age kid drive my parent's Highlander, renting a slightly larger van, or hiring a proper shuttle service like the ones down by the airport. 

We're expecting around 90 guests, including our families and bridesmaids and folks who will be arriving well before the regular guests - so maybe ~75 guests who will arrive around the same time and need to be shuttled? My parents' vehicle can only fit 5 passengers, so 75 guests would be 15 trips. If each trip is around 5 min round trip, it would take over an hour to shuttle everyone up to the venue. This just feels untenable to me - people would be waiting at the shuttle stop a long time, and a lot of them would miss the coffee hour completely. 

We've looked at renting a passenger van; it looks like the largest we can rent in our area is a 14-passenger van for around $350. So that could get everyone in about 5-6 trips, which would take around 25-30 min. 

Professional shuttle services only seem to offer the same 14-passenger vans we could rent ourselves, or enormous charter buses that may not have enough space to turn around at the venue (small turnaround area at the end of a long, narrow driveway).

If you’re in the Moira area, between 18-45 and want to get out more, meet new people, and do something different, then Round Table could be exactly what you're looking for!

We’re a non-denominational, non-political social club for men (or those who identify as male) across over 60 countries who want to have fun, try new things, and give back to their communities. It’s all about making the most of life—whether that means heading out on adventures, having a laugh down the pub, or getting involved in charity and community events.

So, what do we actually do?

Every Table (local group) is different, but we get up to all sorts, including:

🏎️ Go-karting, paintballing, axe-throwing, and escape rooms

🎯 Archery, shooting, golf, and other sports

🚤 Water sports like wakeboarding, sailing, and paddleboarding

🍻 Brewery tours, whiskey tastings, airfryer masterchef!

🌍 Trips abroad, adventure weekends, and festivals

💪 Charity events, fundraising challenges, and community projects

But it’s not just about having fun—Round Table also helps you grow as a person. You’ll build confidence, develop leadership skills, and step outside your comfort zone in a supportive environment. Whether it’s organising events, public speaking, or taking on challenges you never thought you would, you’ll walk away with skills for life.

Get involved internationally! 🌎

Round Table isn’t just local—it’s a worldwide organisation. Members get the chance to travel to international meet-ups, festivals, and exchange programs with Tables across Europe and beyond. Whether it’s a beer festival in Belgium, a skiing trip in Austria, or a world meeting in South Africa, you’ll have mates all over the world ready to welcome you.

What’s the catch?

No catch—just a small membership fee (around the price of a coffee a week). Only payable when you decide you want to be a registered member, so you can see if it’s for you first.

Why 18-45?

Round Table is all about bringing together like-minded guys in the same stage of life. It means that as members move on at 45, there’s always space for the next generation of guys to join, take leadership roles, and shape the future of their Table.

But don’t worry—when you hit 45, you don’t have to say goodbye! Most members continue their journey in 41 Club (another club in the Round Table family), where they stay connected and keep enjoying great events.

We've got tables all over the country in Armagh, Enniskillen, Belfast, Mid Ulster and Causeway Coast as well as a number of tables down South!

Sound good? Think you’d love to see something like this in the Moira area ? Give us a message, let’s make it happen!

I really don't get this. Man, how are you even studying for 12 hours. I wake up, I can hardly concentrate continuously for half an hour. Then eat breakfast. I start feeling so sleepy...that's out of control... whatever I do..walk around, hear songs, splash cold water, nothing works. I end up sleeping till 11.30-12...then study till 1... Now hungry, so i eat then I fell sleepy again. Sleep till 4. Then study till 6...take bath..walk around, spend time with family...may be study sometime...then have dinner...study for an hour and I sleep again. I can't reduce my sleep..I need solid 8 hours of sleep to do basic functions like even talking. So if I don't sleep when I want to sleep, I cannot study at all. Even during my clg days, I would sleep in my lunch break and imme after coming from classes. Also sometimes in clinical postings. Coffee never worked, so i got caffeine tablets ..I take over 400 mg somedays. Still I fall asleep. Like I m sleepy all day. And man, I can focus when I open the book even after these much of sleep. It feels like lifting mountain, so i study without a good focus which doesn't even count as focus. I deleted all my apps, tried all dopamine detox hack from internet. I really want to make it. But I don't know where to get that determination, discipline and focus from. I seriously need help. My parents just taunt me all day telling i m lazy and irresponsible. But I can't help...the sleep and my inability to focus is out my control. Please help me with practical solutions.
I tried offline classes too...I simply go there...take notes in the start of the day..later just zone out and state at the teacher or wall. 
I really how what I read, but I can never focus or control my sleepiness.
I can't focus on other tasks too like watching a movie or series and I feel same sleepiness then too. ",10,1748024662.0,indianmedschool,18,0.75,False

Bit of an odd request, but I was wondering if anyone here is traveling from Hyderabad to Bangalore tomorrow. I’ve got a small package, just some packaged food that I want to send to a friend there. Nothing heavy. 

Couriers are either taking too long or charging way too much for a quick delivery(I need it to reach it by Sunday) so I thought I’d try my luck here.

I can drop it off to you wherever it’s convenient in Hyderabad and once you’re in Bangalore, my friend can come pick it up or I’ll arrange a uber to collect it from you. 

Happy to cover any small expenses or just say thanks with a coffee or snack. If you’re heading that way and don’t mind helping out, please DM me. Thank you in advance.

I’m part of a therapy group that’s about to end soon, and over the past months, I’ve built a meaningful connection with the group therapist, not just in a therapeutic way, but as a person I genuinely respect and feel I’d get along with outside that setting. If it makes any difference, I would like to mention that it is a skill based group and not deep dive trauma etc.

To be clear: I understand the ethical boundaries during therapy, and I’m not talking about a romantic or inappropriate dynamic. I’m aware of the power imbalance that can exist in therapy, and I want to be careful and respectful of that.

That said, I’ve been thinking about whether or not I can ask her if she’d be open to keeping in touch after the group ends. Casually, like maybe a coffee at some point or even just staying in contact in some form. But only after the group therapy ends.

I won’t get into too many details but there is just a sense of genuine connection, like she truly enjoys our dynamic beyond the usual therapist-client rapport. I don’t want to overread or assume anything, but it has felt meaningful and personal in a way that stands out.

My question is: •	Have any of you ever seen or experienced something like this from either side (as a client or therapist)? •	Is it ever appropriate or possible to stay in touch once therapy has ended? •	Would asking, gently and respectfully already cross a line?

I’m trying to be honest but still grounded in reality. I’d love to hear your insights or experiences, whether you’re a therapist, client, or just someone who understands these dynamics.",2,1748024247.0,askatherapist,2,1.0,False
1ktqkqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeReviewedIt/comments/1ktqkqp/nunerve_review_6_weeks_can_nanotech_nutrition/,NuNerve Review (6 Weeks) ⚡ Can Nanotech Nutrition Really Relieve Nerve Discomfort?,"# 🌿 Terry Was Pleasantly Surprised ...

Nerve pain is like your body's idea of a prank—annoying, unfunny, and always badly timed.

Whether it’s pins and needles or fiery zaps down your leg, it messes with your day and your sleep. You can’t focus, and even walking barefoot becomes a weird gamble.

I’ve tried a small army of capsules claiming to help. Most ended up living rent-free in my supplement graveyard. But then I [heard about NuNerve](https://theworldhealth.org/try-nunerve-official), a **nerve health support supplement** that uses nano absorption.

I raised an eyebrow—and placed an order.

# 🧾 Product Overview

**Product Name:** NuNerve  
**Category:** Health Supplements → Nerve Support  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.7/5

# 🔍 What Is NuNerve?

NuNerve delivers nutrients that may help rebuild damaged nerves—without wasting them on a trip through your digestive system.

It uses **a nano delivery system designed for neuropathy relief** that breaks ingredients into tiny particles. The goal? Better absorption.

It’s promoted as **the best nerve supplement that uses nanotechnology**—a bold claim, but they do stack it with ingredients known for results.

The blend supports people looking for **nerve pain relief without medication**, and might surprise folks who’ve been burned by gimmicks before.

# 🌿 Key Ingredients Breakdown

This isn’t a random mix of buzzwords. Here’s what’s inside—and why it matters:

* **R-Alpha Lipoic Acid**: Supports nerve cells and balances blood sugar. **For nerves**, **B12 vs alpha lipoic acid** is a common comparison.

🌱

* **Vitamin B12, B6, B1**: Together, they work as **vitamins for nerve pain and regeneration**. You need these if your nervous system is waving a white flag.

🌱

* **Palmitoylethanolamide for nerve pain**: It’s a mouthful, but this natural fatty acid compound may calm inflammation and reduce discomfort.

🌱

* **Lion’s Mane for nerve repair**: The shaggy mushroom with a better memory than most humans. It may [stimulate nerve growth](https://theworldhealth.org/try-nunerve-official) and help with clarity.

🌱

* **Whole Coffee Fruit Extract**: Helps **increase BDNF naturally**, which matters if your nerves feel sluggish.

🌱

* **Organic Curcumin Longa**: Anti-inflammatory and often cited as**as a compound that helps heal nerve damage**. Spoiler: it might.

🌱

* The full combo? Worthy of a “**NuNerve ingredients explained**” video, honestly.

# ⚙️ How It Works: Nano Absorption Explained

This is where things get futuristic. Most supplements throw nutrients at your gut and hope they stick. NuNerve claims to do better by breaking them down so tiny they’re easier to absorb.

People often ask, **does nanotechnology improve supplement absorption**? The theory checks out—smaller bits mean faster use.

That’s where NuNerve positions itself as one of the few **supplements using nano absorption for nerve pain**.

This process might even explain **how nano absorption helps nerve regeneration**. Your cells don’t have to fight to use what’s provided. It’s fast, it’s clean, and it makes NuNerve feel more like fuel than fluff.

# 🧑‍🔬 Terry's Personal Experience ...

A friend of mine, **Terry A**, is a part-time sound engineer who I met through a local vegan co-op we both volunteer at.

Terry spends long hours hunched over mixing boards and carrying heavy gear, and over time, the repetitive strain started messing with the nerves in his hands and forearms.

He’d wake up with that all-too-familiar tingling sensation—pins and needles that overstayed their welcome—and sometimes even had trouble gripping small tools.

He was skeptical of supplements (like, deeply skeptical), but after chatting with me about **natural treatments for nerve damage**, he agreed to [give NuNerve a shot](https://theworldhealth.org/try-nunerve-official).

He kept at it consistently for six weeks. By week three, he told me he noticed less stiffness in the mornings and was sleeping better—not because NuNerve knocked him out, but because the discomfort wasn’t waking him up anymore.

The tingling didn’t vanish completely, but it eased up enough that he could work longer sessions without needing breaks every 20 minutes.

The only real gripe he had? “Capsules taste weird if you forget to eat,” he warned with a laugh. But overall, he’s still taking it—and he doesn’t usually stick to anything unless it *actually* works.

# ⭐ Star Ratings (Out of 5)

* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Effectiveness** – Gradual relief within weeks. Not magic, but measurable progress.
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Ingredients** – High-quality components often found in the **best supplements for nerve repair**.
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ **Ease of Use** – Easy to swallow, but take it with food unless you enjoy herbal flashbacks.
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ **Absorption** – Thanks to nano tech, here's a **nerve health supplement that absorbs quickly**.
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Value** – A little pricey, but fair for the blend and delivery method.

**Average Score: 4.7/5**

# ✅ Pros and ❌ Cons

# Pros

🟢 **Well-studied ingredients known to support nerve healing**  
🟢 **Uses nanotech to improve absorption and delivery**  
🟢 Supports those seeking **natural treatments for nerve damage**  
🟢 Ideal for anyone searching for **supplements for nerve repair that use advanced delivery methods**

# Cons

🔴 **Mild aftertaste if taken without food**  
🔴 **Not an instant fix—expect to wait 2–4 weeks**  
🔴 **Only sold online—not in physical stores yet**

# 💬 What Other Users Are Saying

Many reviews read like relief in lowercase. People reported small wins—less tingling, more restful nights, more stable steps. One said it helped them grip a coffee mug without fear.

Another praised its effect on [post-chemo nerve issues](https://theworldhealth.org/try-nunerve-official), calling it “the only thing that did more than take my money.” Many users considered it the **nerve pain supplement with the highest absorption rate**.

While you’ll see the occasional complaint about price or shipping, reviews often agree it's among **supplements for neuropathy relief** worth sticking with.

# ⚠️ Safety and Potential Side Effects

Most users tolerate NuNerve well. Some mention light nausea if taken on an empty stomach. That’s common for **anti-inflammatory supplements for nerves**, especially ones with strong herbs.

No reports of major side effects in forums or buyer comments. That said, don’t mix this with medications without a quick chat with your doctor. Be safe. Your nerves will thank you.

# ⏳ How Long Does It Take to Work?

For most people, this isn’t a quick fix. You’ll need at least two weeks before you feel a shift. Terry hit his stride at week three.

Based on stories I’ve read, the average person begins to notice improvements around 18–30 days. Even **supplements for nerve repair that use advanced delivery methods** still take time to work.

If you want results fast, you’ll probably be frustrated. But if you’re patient, you may be pleasantly surprised.

# 💰 Pricing Options

NuNerve is available in three bundles:

* **1 Bottle** – $69
* **3 Bottles** – $177 ($59 per bottle)
* **6 Bottles** – $294 ($49 per bottle)

You get better value with the larger packs, which makes sense for a **bioavailable supplement for nerve health** you’re likely to take for several weeks.

# 🛒 Where To Buy NuNerve

Only [buy NuNerve online from the official website](https://theworldhealth.org/try-nunerve-official). That’s where you get the 60-day refund guarantee—and peace of mind you’re not buying an expired knockoff in a sketchy bottle.

It’s also the only place to access limited-time pricing on multi-month bundles. Don’t roll the dice elsewhere.

# ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does it help with diabetic nerve pain?**  
A: Some users with diabetes said it eased numbness and tingling. Results vary, but reviews are positive.

**Q: Is this safe with other supplements?**  
A: If you’re taking multiple vitamins, check the B content—NuNerve already covers a lot.

**Q: What makes this different from regular B12 pills?**  
A: The **nano absorption process** and extra ingredients set it apart from basic options.

**Q: Can I stop after symptoms improve?**  
A: Yes. Some cycle off after three months. Others continue for ongoing support.

**Q: Is it vegetarian-friendly?**  
A: Yes. The capsules don’t use gelatin and the ingredients are plant-based.

**Q: Is this good for older adults?**  
A: Many reviews came from folks over 60. It seems to be helpful across age groups.

So many beautiful nights together. You felt like home. I don't know how to accept the duality of you. How the good was so good but you could also be so bad for me.

I can't forget all the little things you did for me-- the trips to the store to pick us up coffee and snackies. The way you'd cook and make a little heart out of basil on my plate. The idle massages and hand squeezes. Falling asleep safe in your arms. The intensity that you loved.

How could someone that cried at the thought of others in pain also inflict so much? How could you go to bed with another? How could you push my hurt aside while you made them glow? How could you keep them in your life when it killed me?

I don't hate them, though. I get it. They were nice, caring. They were a lot like me. They filled that void for you that the distance created. But you hurt them too. Told us two different stories. And I think you believed both of your stories. I do.

I don't think you're a villain. You agonize over my pain. But you're selfish, and scared. Fear of being alone leads you into their arms, and fear of hurting others makes you hurt us both more. The fog of your personality disorder makes your reality crack at the seams before you.

But still, you lied. Even if it's from a desperate traumatized part of yourself, you lied, gaslit, and manipulated. So many other times you minimized my concerns and downplayed your actions. You treated me like I was controlling for not wanting you to flirt with others. You had to have backup plans even though you were all I could think about being with.

I hate that I relented on boundaries for you. I hate that I apologized when you were in the wrong. My brain was so twisted that I felt like if I made myself the one at fault, I could fix things. I so desperately wanted to. I wanted to forgive you but you broke your promises again.

I can't stop reaching out because I'm scared of you moving on. I don't want to be alone in this pain. But either answer hurts me. Hearing you say you can't live without me, that you wanted to marry me, that you can't live with the pain you caused me, it makes my heart ache for you.

But getting on that flight home alone, when you promised you'd get on it with me, broke me beyond repair. I have no more hope to hold onto. I gave more than I had to give and now I have to sweep up the pieces of myself back into something almost human. I can never come back from this, and you'll never make the same sacrifices for me. So someday we'll be strangers again, and our time together will be a bittersweet, faded memory of a life that won't feel like my own anymore.",1,1748024167.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,2,1.0,False
1ktqjqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/1ktqjqs/can_i_stay_in_touch_with_my_group_therapist_after/,Can I stay in touch with my group therapist after therapy ends?,"I’d really appreciate some honest perspectives on a situation I’m currently in.

I’m part of a therapy group that’s about to end soon, and over the past months, I’ve built a meaningful connection with the group therapist, not just in a therapeutic way, but as a person I genuinely respect and feel I’d get along with outside that setting. If it makes any difference, I would like to mention that it is a skill based group and not deep dive trauma etc.

To be clear: I understand the ethical boundaries during therapy, and I’m not talking about a romantic or inappropriate dynamic. I’m aware of the power imbalance that can exist in therapy, and I want to be careful and respectful of that.

That said, I’ve been thinking about whether or not I can ask her if she’d be open to keeping in touch after the group ends. Casually, like maybe a coffee at some point or even just staying in contact in some form. But only after the group therapy ends.

I won’t get into too many details but there is just a sense of genuine connection, like she truly enjoys our dynamic beyond the usual therapist-client rapport. I don’t want to overread or assume anything, but it has felt meaningful and personal in a way that stands out.

My question is: •	Have any of you ever seen or experienced something like this from either side (as a client or therapist)? •	Is it ever appropriate or possible to stay in touch once therapy has ended? •	Would asking, gently and respectfully already cross a line?

I’m trying to be honest but still grounded in reality. I’d love to hear your insights or experiences, whether you’re a therapist, client, or just someone who understands these dynamics.",1,1748024141.0,TalkTherapy,5,0.67,False

1ktqi5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ktqi5r/no_replies_after_meetup/,No replies after meetup,"So basically this girl posted on Reddit that she’s going through a break up and needed someone to talk with. As someone who was going through a similar situation, I texted her and we both agreed to meet at a coffee shop. We both talked about our situations and past dating experiences. She was almost tearing up talking about it.

So I asked her if she wants to go out that will cheer her up. She agreed and then we got out of the coffee shop. As we started walking she all of a sudden told me that her dad is calling her and she needs to go home, and that she’s taking care of her mother or something. She said I can text her later on Reddit, I asked do you want to exchange numbers, she said I don’t want to do that right now, so I said okay.

Fast forward, after she left I texted her saying it was nice to meet her, everything will be fine…. Get home safe. After that she never responded to me. Now I don’t really know what to do or how to take it. I think she was really pretty and we are both in a similar situation and I want to work something out with her.",1,1748024035.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
