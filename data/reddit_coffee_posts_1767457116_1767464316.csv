I had a moment this morning, wishing I could grab a coffee and a scone or a breakfast sandwich nearby...but I have Celiac, so it's not that easy for me.

The 2024 census estimate puts the population of the city at 182,797. 1-3% of the general population has Celiac disease. That's at least 1,827 to 5,483 people who could potentially benefit from a gluten-free bakery in Elk Grove.

1q31nv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/lupus/comments/1q31nv7/constant_facial_swelling_with_no_flare_up/,Constant facial swelling with no flare up,"Hi everyone. 

I have been having issues with my face looking like a basketball for years. I’m under 100lbs and 4’11, but my face makes me look like I’m overweight. I hate being photographed because of it and I will leave the light off when I go to the bathroom just so I don’t have to see myself in the mirror. My face is almost always inflamed/puffy, even if I’m not in the middle of a flare up. I know it’s not food related either, because I can be fasting and my face will still be swollen (this is definitely a lupus thing as well, as this wasn’t a thing until my autoimmune issues started). I don’t understand why. 

I exercise and eat relatively okay. I don’t drink alcohol or coffee, and I only drink sugar free drinks if I ever want a “soda”. I try to avoid sugar at all costs as well. 

I’m taking HCQ, celebrex, and cymbalta for lupus/OA. I have been offered prednisone but I refused it because I was on it as a kid for asthma and it caused me to gain a ton of weight. Does anyone have any tips at all on how to get facial swelling down??? This is just horrific to live with. 

This is impacting my everyday life at this point. I don’t want to be photographed, or even do the things I loved to do before. I used to stream and I wanted to get back into it again. But every time I even turn on my webcam to set my OBS up, I look at my face on screen and it makes me cringe. 

I don’t want anymore medications because I’m already on so many for my lupus, OA, epilepsy, hashimotos, etc. So, if you have any other recommendations other than medicine, please, I’ll try anything 😅",1,1767464009.0,lupus,0,1.0,False

1q31l24,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1q31l24/rf_everyday_heroes/,[RF]  Everyday Heroes,"EVERYDAY HEROES      


Bob Collins was not who you would automatically think of when someone mentioned a hero. He was more of a nerd than someone that would be described as a hero. More Clark Kent than Superman. But he was a true hero for his wife. 
    
Bob and Cindy looked like the typical couple that you see all the time. They had the typical house in a decent neighborhood, they had two young daughters about ready to start elementary school, Bob worked in sales while Cindy was busy at home taking care of the home and family. Just a typical young family that you will see in any neighborhood.
    
Bob and Cindy met when they were in their freshman year of college. Bob was majoring in International Business and Cindy was a Communications major. Both were very ambitious and motivated. They were focused on their studies and avoided the party scene that their fellow students were devoted to. They both came from working class families so didn't have their parents to support their partying so they focused on their studies. 
    
They met at the library when they were both studying. Bob noticed Cindy immediately. Bob thought she was beautiful. The type that doesn't need makeup to be pretty. Not flashy at all, but in a more classic way. Beauty that doesn't fade with time. But what made Cindy especially beautiful was she didn't know how pretty she was.
Bob was immediately attracted to her but thought he didn't stand a chance. She was way out of his league. 
    
It took Cindy a bit to notice Bob. She finally noticed him because he was at the library studying every Friday evening. She was curious because she thought she was the only one on campus that did that. When she finally asked him why he was in the library on a Friday evening, he told her that the dorms were too noisy to think, and forget about studying. And he was trying to fit in extra classes so he had to study so he could keep up.  He was also working in the cafeteria, which provided his meals and also gave him spending money, but took up part of his study time. This intrigued Cindy because money was really tight  for her as well, so she asked Bob if he could help her to get a job there. Bob said he would do all he could. He then mustered up all the courage he had and asked Cindy if she wanted to get a coffee. 

Cindy took a close look at Bob. He was a decent looking guy, not a flirty, heartthrob kind of person at all, but in more of a shy, cute boy next door sort of way. He looked innocent and sincere so she accepted. They wound up having a long conservation.   
    
They found out they had a lot in common. They both wanted to have corporate jobs. They wanted to travel, not just see the tourist sights, but the places off the beaten path. They enjoyed the same type of music, enjoyed quiet conversations, and did not like the loud club scene. Bob admitted that he found loud parties exhausting and gave him a headache. By the time Bob walked her back to her dorm, he knew she was the one. He had never felt so relaxed yet so energized.   
    
Then he had a wave of self doubt hit him. How long should he wait to get back in touch? What should he say? What should he do? He didn't want to come off creepy and scare her off. She had to have guys hitting on her all the time. He tossed and turned all night. Then it hit him. She had asked about getting a job at the cafeteria. 

Bob went in the next morning to talk with the manager. They were on friendly terms, so Bob told the manager about Cindy. The manager told him to have her come in for an interview. There was a position that had recently opened up, and they were looking for someone. Bob called Cindy right away and told her what the manager said. Cindy thanked him and said she would go in right away. She then told him that she had really enjoyed the night before and they should do it again soon. Bob floated all the way home.
    
Once Cindy started working at the cafeteria, they were inseparable. They would study then go on long walks around campus together in the evening. If they weren't with each other they were talking on the phone. This was new territory for both of them, they had crushes before but had never been in a real relationship before, much less a serious one. Cindy would have guys flirt with her a lot but they always came off creepy like they were trying to prove something, so she would turn them down.

One of these boys caught them while they were on one of their evening walks. He was so drunk he having trouble walking. Bob recognized him. This guy thought of himself as a legend on campus. He was on the football team, dated the pretty girls, drove a fancy car that his parents bought him. He was the type of guy that was never told no. 

When this guy saw Cindy, he came drunkenly stumbling up to them and started loudly professing his love for her. How Cindy broke his heart and she had to be his girlfriend. Trying to get around Bob and closer to Cindy, he lost his balance and grabbed on to Cindy. Bob pulled out his phone and turned on the flashlight, putting it right in the guys face. Bob then shouted “The police have been called and are on their way and I am live streaming this. You can either take off right now and never come near Cindy again or stick around and be arrested for sexual assault, as well well as a slew of other charges that you will have to explain to your coach and your parents. What are you going to do?” The boy sobered up real quick and ran off as fast as he could in his drunken state. They never saw him again. 

Cindy asked if had really called the police? Bob laughed and said no, but the guy didn't know that. Cindy thought about it then asked what if that didn't work? Bob told her that he would have grabbed her and they would have run together, the guy was so drunk he would have fallen on his face. Cindy felt safe with Bob. She put her arm around him as they walked and snuggled into him.
    
During the summer break they met each other's family and before the end of their sophomore year they were engaged. They planned to have their wedding during the summer break that year. Then they would start their junior year in family housing on campus. They had it all planned out. They had a small wedding in Cindy's hometown then a quick honeymoon in a resort area closer to Bob's hometown. That summer flew by and they were preparing to start their Junior year.
    
Then Cindy found out she was pregnant. Bob was devastated yet excited at the same time. They both wanted children but they were going to wait until they graduated and had their careers established. They had tried to be careful. It must have happened on their honeymoon. What were they going to do now? 
    
They decided that they would have to put their education on hold for now, and Bob would have to find a job to support the family. Cindy was worried that Bob may resent her and the baby. Bob assured her that as long as they were together that he would be happy. This is what they wanted, it just happened a little sooner than they had planned. 
    
Bob found a job in sales at a national distribution company. He could make a decent wage, but it was based on commission. He would have passed on the job but it did offer a benefit package. With the baby on the way, he needed the benefits.
    
When he started the job, Bob studied it. He read books on how to master sales. He talked with the people that had been doing the job for a while and learned the tricks of the trade. He became fairly successful at his job. He didn't really enjoy the job, even though he was good at it. He focused on the fact that it allowed him to provide his family with a decent lifestyle. They had to be careful but all their needs were covered. He would have liked to be doing a lot of other things but this wasn't his forever job.


Bob and Cindy had agreed once they found out she was pregnant with their second baby that she would stay at home until the girls started school then she would finish her degree and get a job then Bob would be able to finish his degree and get a job he would enjoy. He was happy he was able to take care of his family and that is what was important. 
    
Where Bob worked, the CEO would drop in periodically from the  corporate headquarters to check on everything. A person from the sales team would be assigned to drive him around and take care of whatever he needed or wanted. The person that normally took care of it had been promoted so they needed someone else to take care of it. Most of the sales team wouldn't accept the assignment because if they weren't selling, they weren't making money. Also they had seniority over Bob, so it fell on him to drive the CEO while he was in town.
    
Bob remembered in one of his classes he heard how one person who was already successful was willing to pay an insane amount of money to be able to work with someone whom he considered a legend in business. He was asked if that was what he wanted to be paid and he replied no, that is how much he would pay. Because with what he would learn from this person, he could make ten times what he was willing to pay. Bob had always remembered that so when he was asked to help the CEO, he jumped at the chance. 
    
The first thing Bob did was contact the person who used to take care of the assignment and asked for all the details that they could think of. Bob offered to buy him lunch so they could discuss it. Bob wound up getting an extensive list of things to do and don't, likes and dislikes. It helped him to keep from making embarrassing and tragic mistakes. 
    
After the first time, the CEO would specifically ask for Bob whenever he came to town. The CEO asked Bob about his background, he just didn't seem like the typical sales person. Bob explained that he was an International Business major but due to his wife becoming pregnant, he had to put his education on hold and got a job. He was planning on finishing his degree as soon as he could.
     
The CEO started to discuss business strategies and market conditions with Bob whenever he was in town. One day the CEO called Bob and told him that they wanted Bob at corporate headquarters, working with the imports division. Bob would be given two days a week to attend classes so he could finish his degree. He would be given a raise of course, and the relocation would be handled by the company.  

Bob couldn't believe it. Working in the area of business he wanted, and being able to finish his degree a lot sooner. He asked the CEO why and Bob was told that the reason that the CEO had been able to build this business as large as it was is that he was always looking for people that had talent, then put them in a position to use it and grow. That is how you develop loyal employees and grow a thriving business.
    
He talked to Cindy as soon as he hung up with the CEO, then he accepted the offer. Soon they were moved and both of the girls were starting school. Bob signed up for the fall semester at the University that was close to where they were living. Since both girls were now in school, Cindy signed up also. It worked out with their class schedule that they were able to commute to school together so they were able to spend more time with each other. 
    
While at a company awards ceremony where spouses were invited, Bob and Cindy met one of the department managers. During the conversation, he mentioned that his Executive Assistant was leaving. Would Cindy be interested in the position? Bob and Cindy talked about it and Cindy would like to have adult interactions since she had only been with the girls and at her classes most of the students were still kids. Besides this position would work well with her studies. Once it was worked out that she would have the same schedule as Bob, having two days a week to attend classes, she accepted the offer. 
     
Bob had been really busy, but noticed things were definitely off with Cindy. She had become withdrawn and sad all the time. At first Bob thought it was the stress from finishing their degrees, but it persisted and progressively seemed to get worse. When they were alone, Bob asked Cindy what was going on. It felt to him that she had changed. Cindy tried to change the subject but when Bob wouldn't, she started crying. Then ugly sobbing. It was like a dam of  emotions burst.
    
When she was able to talk she said that she didn't want to say anything, she thought that the situation would blow over if she ignored it. She didn't realize that it had affected her so much. It was the department manager that she was working for. Since she started working, he was always nice, almost too nice. He started to get close whenever they would talk, then the touching started. At first she thought that was just the way he was, some people are kind of touchy, feelies. But as time went on the touches became more brazen and inappropriate. She told him she was not comfortable with it. He laughed and eased up for just a day or two, but then started back doing the same things again. Then he started making little comments that could be explained away as being innocent, but how he said it was anything but. Now he was suggesting they have an affair.   
    
She had wanted to say something but he was her boss. It would be her word against his. She was afraid that he would make trouble not only for her, but also for Bob. Cindy told him that she was not interested but he didn't let up. She couldn't just avoid him because her job required close contact with him. Cindy had planned on riding it out until she received her degree then quitting and getting a job somewhere else. Bob held her tight and told her not to worry, he would take care of it. She looked at him with fear in her eyes. She told him not to do anything stupid. He smiled and told her not to worry, there were better ways of dealing with this than beating someone up. Remember the football player?
    
Bob knew the CEO would be in his office early the next day so Bob was there earlier than usual. He talked to the CEO about what Cindy had told him. The CEO turned white when he heard. Bob said that as much as he hated to, both he and Cindy would have to quit. The CEO told Bob to hold off for just a little. He was going to take care of this right away. If after he did and Bob still wanted to quit, they would talk about it. Then the CEO settled back in his chair and said that he knew something was going on with that department, but he hadn't been able to get to the bottom of it. But now it all made sense. 

He paused then asked Bob if he ever wondered why he as the CEO would visit all the offices so often. He answered without waiting for a response. It is because numbers and reports do not tell the whole story. You can walk into a place and tell a lot about what is going on. The way people look at you, what their attitude is, if they are happy or not. 
     
I knew something was going on with that department. There was too much tension, too much fear, distrust, and the turnover rate was way too high. I just needed the key to what was going on. I'm going to take care of it immediately. Thank you for coming to me directly, letting me know what is going on, and not just quitting. 

When the department manager was called to the CEO’s office a few days later, what happened was probably not what the manager was expecting. After the meeting with the CEO and HR, he was escorted out of the building by security with his cardboard box of personal belongings.
     
It was amazing the change it made with Cindy. It was like someone flipped a switch. She became more like she was before the job, only better. She was now more confident, happy and had a closer relationship with Bob and the girls. In her eyes Bob was and always would be her hero. He had always looked after her and kept her safe. He had given up finishing his degree when she had gotten pregnant, took a job he was not thrilled about, and had become a great father and husband. He was a true hero.
    
He had put aside what he wanted and was right for him because it simply was the right thing to do. When we start to look closer, heroes are all around us. Ones that gave up their dreams to do what was the right thing then wake up to realize they may never be able to do what they felt was the right thing for them. 

Bob and Cindy graduated shortly after. As Bob watched Cindy walk across the stage to receive her degree, he realized that although life had not turned out just like they planned, he wouldn't want it any other way. He had a beautiful wife and two precious daughters. There had been struggles along the way, but he would not change a thing. He was truly happy. What more could anyone ask for?

• Upload your selfie once  
• Pick any celebrity from the database  
• Choose a scene/background (coffee shop, beach, hotel lobby, etc.)  
• Get your photo in like 10 seconds

1q31imy,https://www.reddit.com/r/irishpersonalfinance/comments/1q31imy/help_please_still_listed_as_employed_by_old_job/,Help please? Still listed as employed by old job + small Twitch income while on disability,"Hi all, I’m hoping someone can point me in the right direction because I’m completely tax illiterate and very overwhelmed.

In 2019 I worked for a well-known coffee chain. I was already on Disability Allowance for mental health reasons, so I wasn’t working many hours or earning much. While working there, I was seriously injured. I ended up bedridden for almost two years and unable to walk.

After the injury, the company didn’t seem to know what to do with me. I was put on sabbatical and then basically never heard from them again. They stopped responding to emails, texts, everything — even when I took a personal injury case against them. As far as I know, I was never formally let go.

Because of this, when I log into Revenue, I’m still listed as working for them. I tried removing them before, but Revenue added them back, so I assume I’m technically still marked as employed. I genuinely don’t know what I’m supposed to do here.

I still can’t work due to ongoing health complications from being immobile for so long, even though I can walk again now.

While I was stuck in bed, I got into video games and I now stream on Twitch occasionally as a hobbie. I earn *very* little — maybe €50 every 3–4 months — because I don’t have the energy to be consistent. I filled in Twitch’s tax form with my PPSN, but I have no idea what that actually means on the Irish side.

My questions are:

* How do I deal with Revenue still listing me as employed by a company that’s basically ghosted me?
* Do I need to register anything with Revenue for Twitch income even though it’s tiny and I’m not “employed” by them?
* How does this interact with Disability Allowance?
* Is there a simple way to fix this without accidentally getting myself in trouble?

I’ve tried to learn about tax stuff but it honestly doesn’t stick at all, so plain-English answers would be really appreciated. Thanks so much.",0,1767463697.0,irishpersonalfinance,3,0.5,False

Dale came in a plain Tahoe with a small dash light and siren running. I had seen him in court a few times, heard stories about standoffs he had worked. 

He stepped out with a black bag and a radio handset, no pistol. His hair had gone thin up top and lines had scored the corners of his mouth. He moved like a man who had walked into too many situations like this and lived to do it again.

He went straight to the captain’s hood and set the bag down. “What we got?”

“Single male with long gun and a pistol at minimum,” Reynolds said. “Traps in the yard and timberline. Multiple children and a wife presumed inside. One deputy shot. One more got caught in a trap, medical just took him. Suspect has been firing at random from windows, no aimed shots in the last half hour.”

“He been talking?”

“He won’t shut up,” Reynolds said. “We’ve got him on cell phone right now. You’ll have no trouble getting words out of him. Just don’t expect them to be useful.”

They plugged Dale into the main line County had patched through. A portable speaker sat on the Tahoe hood so command could hear both ends. The hood was dotted with road grit and old bug splatter.

I edged up close enough to hear, then held at the rim of that crowd. 

Dale lifted the phone and introduced himself.

“Jimmy, this is Dale with the sheriff’s office,” he said. “I am here to talk with you, man to man. First off, I want to tell you nobody is coming in that house right now. Nobody is rushing in to get you. Now, what I want is to hear what you want.”

“What I want is you sons of whores to get off my land,” he said. “You gonna do that for me, Mr. Dale.”

“I hear you,” Dale said. “You want us to give you space and some respect for your home. Not unreasonable. Only trouble is, we have that 911 call. Kid said someone was getting hurt in there. We have to square that before we leave. Help me with that and we can talk about getting folks out of your yard.”

“You want to talk about hurt?” Jimmy said. “You shot me up. That old cocksucker got me on the side.”

“Is your son in there,” Dale asked, changing lanes. “Seems like he’s important to you. Why don’t we get him somewhere safe while we talk.”

Jimmy breathed into the phone. The sound filled the speaker like he had his mouth right on it.

“You want him?” Jimmy said at last. “You ain’t taking him. He’s mine. None of you had a hand in making him. He’s not the county’s. He’s not the school’s. Hell, he’s not even the churches. He’s mine.”

“We got the 911 recording,” Dale said. “We played it back. Voice on there says his daddy is hurting his sister. That phone pinged somewhere near your address. There’s no other houses for miles around here. You see the problem we got here, Jimmy? We can’t walk away from that and sleep with ourselves tonight.”

Jimmy’s answer came curved. “My boy called,” he asked. “He called you on my line?”

“We don’t know who called,” Dale said, pivoting again. “But whoever it was sounded scared. That hurts you, I know it does. But it also tells me we got a way to work this out if you let us.”

“You calling out my boy like that,” Jimmy said. “You think that’ll shame me?”

“No one is trying to shame you,” Dale said. “I want you to know how scared he is. That’s a child who thinks his whole world is ending. You know what that feels like. You had your own childhood in a house where bad things happened. I know you did, Jimmy.”

Jimmy went quiet. Through the open line came faint noises from inside the house. Footsteps. A woman’s words, muffled, enough to carry some sort of emotion.

“You leave my daddy out of this,” Jimmy said finally. “He’s been in the ground twenty years. Don’t need you dragging him back out.”

“Then let that pain die with him,” Dale said. “You don’t have to pass it to your son. You got five daughters in there and a wife. They’re scared out of their minds. Your boy’s the one who had the courage to try to fix things. That is not a betrayal. That’s survival. He’s trying to save them and you.”

Reynolds stepped a half pace closer to the hood. He kept his mouth turned away from the speaker.

“We need that boy,” he murmured to Dale. “Get him out. We can work off what he knows. Floor plan, where the others are, weapons.”

Dale gave a slight nod without breaking his focus on the house.

“Jimmy,” he said, “I am going to ask you for a hard thing. I am going to ask you to send your son out to me. He’s your blood. You prove you love him by letting us take him somewhere safe. And trust me, we will keep him safe. I give you my word on that.”

“You want to steal my boy,” Jimmy said. “You want to turn him against me?”

“No one is stealing anybody,” Dale said. “You can’t protect him in there with bullets coming through the walls. You saw what happened to that deputy’s leg. That was one round in one spot. You start trading real fire with us, this house will fall apart. Your son does not need to be in that blast. You tell him to come out and we will get him out of the way.”

The line crackled. I pictured Jimmy pacing some room with dogs underfoot, pistol in hand, pride doing laps with him.

“He is all I got,” Jimmy said. “Them girls, they got their mama. Boy only has me.”

“He has you whether he is inside or outside,” Dale said. “He will always have you. You will always be his father. You can either be the father who sent him to safety, or the father who kept him in a warzone. You take which one you want to be remembered as.”

I saw Reynolds’ face set at that last word.

“You tell me where you’re gonna put him,” Jimmy said. “You tell me exactly where he’ll go, or this talk is over.”

“We’ll put him right behind the cruisers,” Dale said. “He’ll have medics nearby in case he needs anything. He will not be alone. You and me can keep talking while he sits safe under these leaves.”

“You swear to God you will not touch him,” Jimmy said.

“I swear to you,” Dale said. “You let him go and we treat him with respect. No one cuffs him. He is a child. That is all.”

A thin sound came over the line then. A boy’s voice, not the recording this time. Live. Warped by distance and wires.

“Papa,” he said. “Papa, it’s okay.”

Jimmy barked something at him off the phone. The words blurred. Asking if he had called us. The boy answered, voice breaking.

Dale closed his lids. “You hear that,” he said. “That is your chance. He’s begging you to make a choice that keeps both of you breathing.”

The line went dead long enough we thought he had hung up. Then the speaker popped.

“Alright,” Jimmy said. His throat sounded scraped raw. “You want him. You can have him. You understand me.”

“We hear you,” Dale said. “We won’t hurt him. You walk him to the front door. When I say so, you tell him to walk toward us. That’s all you have to do.”

Command shifted. Orders snapped through the radio.

“All units, be advised, possible hostage release at the front door,” Reynolds said. “Hold fire unless suspect raises that weapon. Marksmen, be ready but do not act without my go ahead.”

I left my tree and slid up near the front line of cruisers. My rifle tracked the porch. Men to either side set their stocks into their shoulders. The air took on that brittle feel it gets before a storm, when everything waits for the first drop.

The front door opened.

Jimmy stepped out with his boy pinned in front of him. The kid’s hair hung over his face. He wore a stained T-shirt and jeans too short at the ankle. Jimmy’s arm was locked across the boy’s chest. In his other hand, pressed to his own temple, he held a pistol.

Every muzzle in our line found them. Safeties clicked.

Up on a low rise by the tree line, Carden, our best shot, crawled into position behind his scope. He spoke into his mic.

“Command, I got his head,” he said. “Clear picture. No kids in the cross. I can end this right now.”

The captain’s answer came back.

“Negative, Carden,” he said. “He’s in compliance. He’s releasing a hostage. You do not pull that trigger. That’s an order.”

Carden hissed a curse we all heard over the mic.

“You are going to regret that,” he muttered, but his finger eased off.

Dale lifted his voice into the open air, not the phone now.

“Jimmy,” he called. “You’re doing good. You tell your boy to start walking toward my voice.”

“Go on,” Jimmy said, loud enough for the line to hear. “Walk to them. You wanted them, right? Don’t look back at me. You hear.”

The boy nodded. His shoulders trembled under Jimmy’s forearm.

Then Jimmy let him go.

The kid took one step off the porch, then another. Bare feet pressed small prints into dust and old blood.

Daylight still sat over the clearing, but it felt distant. What mattered was that strip of ground, and the child moving down it. He kept his arms down at his sides. Head tipped toward the dirt. All that glass and steel pointed his way and he moved with the care of a kid stepping into a river he had had always waded.

“Keep coming, son,” Dale said. “You are doing good. Just walk to me.”

Jimmy stood in the doorway with the pistol still pressed to his own skull. His face had emptied of that wild look. He watched the boy’s back. His shoulders sagged a fraction. For a moment it looked as if he had burned his rage down to coals and what was left would be surrender.

The kid reached the middle of the yard. You could see him wanting to turn. Wanting one last look at his father.

“Good,” Dale said. “Good. Don’t stop. We’re right here.”

Jimmy moved. One motion. Clean. He dropped the muzzle from his own head and drove it forward. The pistol came up steady and found the small span of bone at the back of his boy’s skull.

I do not know who fired first. I know who fired second. Jimmy did.

The shot split the yard. It cracked off and went straight through the hinge of that boy’s life. He jerked once, knees folding. Arms flared out, then fell. He hit the ground face down and did not roll. Grit jumped around him and settled over his back.

The line answered. Rifles and pistols bucked. Muzzle flashes stuttered between cruisers and tree trunks. Rounds tore into the doorway, shattered the front windows, chewed porch posts to splinters. Wood flew. Glass rained down in hard bursts. Plaster blew out in white clouds through fresh holes.

Jimmy flinched under it, shots taking bites of him cloth jumped on his overalls, but he did not fall. He staggered a step, caught himself, and stayed upright through what should have ended him.

He howled once then twisted and plunged into the house. The ruined door slammed. A stray round punched through after him and whined off somewhere above the porch roof.

“Cease fire,” the captain yelled. “Cease fire, God damn it. We got kids in that house.”

Smoke drifted low over the clearing. Burned powder mixed with hot pine. The boy lay where he fell, limbs crooked. His shirt bunched at the shoulders.

“Get the kid,” someone called.

“Negative,” the captain snapped. “No one moves into that yard.”

Dale still held the bullhorn, hand shaking at his side. His face had drained of color. He stared at the porch as if some other answer might appear.

Then Jimmy’s voice came through the broken front, changed. It had an edge that did not sound human.

“You see that,” he bellowed. “You see what I do to my own. You think I will spare any of you? You think your badge means more to me than his blood?”

He started laughing. It rolled out of the shattered windows, muffled in one room and loud in another as he moved through the house.

“You watched him walk,” he shouted. “You aimed at me and you watched him walk and you let me do it. All your training, all your rules, all your little commands, and you stood there. That is on you the same as me.”

A shot cracked from a side window. The round smacked into a tree to my right and showered bark over my shoulder. Another came from the back and punched into the trunk where another one of ours tucked in. Somebody cursed and pressed tighter to cover.

“You all think you’re tough men,” Jimmy roared. “You stand out there in your armor and talk on your radios. I just proved I don’t answer to any of you. If I will do that to my own blood, you tell me what I will do to some stranger in that timberline.”

He walked to another window. The muzzle showed for a breath and spit twice toward the far corner.

“Jimmy, stop shooting,” Dale called. “There is nothing left to prove. You made your point.”

Jimmy started singing again, a broken croon that turned into a shout on the next line, daring us to answer. Under it, I caught a sound from inside. A woman sobbing.

My attention kept going back to the boy.

He lay out there with no cover between him and the house. Every instinct in me screamed to run, hook an arm under him, drag him back to the cruisers. My legs would not move. Fear was part of it, sure, but the bigger part was the math. One twitch at the wrong window and I would not get five yards.

Beside me, a city cop from another district spoke. 

“We really just going to leave that kid out there?”

The captain heard him.

“You put one boot in that dirt without orders and you will be suspended before your blood dries,” he said. 

It hit me then how far from anything decent we had drifted. This was no longer a call with steps and progress. It was a man in a house proving he could do whatever he wanted, and us trying to keep the rest of the children alive by doing nothing that gave him another chance to put on a show.

Jimmy leaned into a window and hollered again.

“Yall turned this place into a circus,” he called. “Well I am the ringmaster now. You stand out there and watch. That is all you are good for.”

Night finally came down on that farm. Light drained out of the clearing and sank into the woods until the house sat in a gray bowl and cruiser lights threw red and blue across bark, tin, and the sides of parked units.

Reynolds stood under the trees with the map again. Lanterns lit the hood. Sweat shone on his neck. A SWAT team from the next county had arrived and joined with our own. Their vests looked older, their faces looked used up. 

“We are not getting any more time,” Rudd said. “We have one shot at surprise on his blind side. We use it or we stand here all night and listen to him work himself up until he takes it out on his family.”

“Agreed.” One of the SWAT men grunted. “You got a path for us, Captain?”

“Best we can tell,” Reynolds said. He traced a finger along the back of the property. “Tree line here. We skirt this fence, step over this wash. We marked two wires on that side. Cut them earlier. No movement from him when we did. You take four men in. Minimal noise. You get to the back door and breach. We keep his attention up front with the negotiator and the PA.”

He looked at me.

“You want in on the breaching team?”

A private part of me wanted to say no, wanted to be anywhere else. Another part, mean and protective, refused to let someone else go in there.

“Yes, sir,” I said.

Reynolds pointed out the men. Rudd with the shield. Glass with the ram. One SWAT guy with a shotgun. Another with a rifle and bolt cutters. We checked each other’s gear in a circle. Plates. Helmets. Radios. Extra mags. My hands moved on their own.

Rudd looked me over.

“You good, kid?”

“I’m going,” I said.

Dale climbed onto the bumper of a cruiser with a bullhorn. His voice rolled out over the lawn, steadier again, like a preacher holding the room together at a funeral dinner.

“Jimmy,” he called. “You still with me. You and me still talking?”

Jimmy answered from inside, words slurred from blood loss or rage or both. They traded phrases, insults, soft hooks meant to keep him on the line. From a distance it almost sounded normal.

We slipped into the trees.

Underfoot lay rusted cans, old tires, lengths of rebar, broken glass. Every step had to go where the man in front had gone. Branches dragged across helmets and snagged vests. The ground pitched uneven, pocked by roots and old stumps.

Rudd led with the shield. The rifleman behind him cut small lanes with his barrel between trunks. Glass carried the ram. I went third from the back, eyes bouncing from their boots to the ground ahead, hunting for wires, boards with nails, anything waiting to turn our feet into a problem. The last man watched our rear.

“Wire,” Rudd whispered, and froze.

I saw it in his light. A cable ran between two saplings at knee height. Tin cans hung from it, dull and battered, set to rattle if you brushed it. The bolt cutter stepped up and worked the jaws in careful bites. The line gave with a small twang. No cans moved. No sound carried. No can popped.

Through the trunks the back wall of the house came closer. The ground flattened, churned by years of dogs, kids, and scrap. A chicken pen leaned near the corner. An old mower lay on its side, half swallowed by moss. The back door sat dark in the center of that wall, no light under the frame.

My pulse drummed. Rudd lifted a fist. We stopped. The house filled our view through the pines. We took knees behind what cover we could find, rifles set, attention pinned to that door.

“On my count,” Rudd murmured. “One, two…”

The motion light over the back door flared to life.

The yard lit up.

It caught our helmets, our faces, Rudd’s shield. It washed the bark and the siding so clean it felt like somebody had thrown bleach on the night. We froze in that glare, every rough edge of wood drawn sharp. Somewhere at the front of the house Jimmy’s talking cut off mid-sentence.

Silence held for one ragged beat.

Then the back door yanked open.

“You sneaking around in my woods,” Jimmy shouted. “You think I don’t feel you out there?”

Another sound rose under his yelling. Barking. Not the panicked racket we had heard before through walls. This came from deep chests and thick throats. Nails scrabbled on wood inside. Collars clinked. Chains dragged.

“Get ready,” Rudd hissed.

The door blew wide and the dogs came out in a spill.

They hit the dirt as one mass. Muscle and scar and slobber, teeth bared, gums showing, set on the line of shapes at the tree edge. Pit bulls, thick through the neck, ribs showing from poor feed but still built for violence. Some had chains still clipped to collars, dragging links that sparked off stones.

“Go on,” Jimmy screamed. “Go earn your keep.”

They came into the trees.

The first slammed Rudd’s shield. He staggered, boots digging, and the hit traveled through him into the man behind. The dog latched on and shook, foam and spit flying. Another skidded around his flank and went for his leg. Teeth snapped on his boot, then caught above it. His yell cracked through the woods.

The rest went wide, scenting new targets.

Two came at me deep and fast. I saw the white of their teeth, scars across their muzzles. They moved with their heads leveled, shoulders rolling, like they had done this before.

I brought my rifle up and fired. The muzzle flash burned out my night sight for a beat. The round took the first dog in the chest and drove it sideways into a tree. It hit and folded, legs kicking, breath tearing out in a whine.

The second launched off a dead log by my knee and went for my throat.

I dropped back on instinct. Its weight crashed across my vest, claws raking plates, jaws clacking where my face had been. Its stink hit me, old meat and wet hide and panic. I jammed the rifle between us, muzzle pressed into its side, and fired again.

Warmth flooded my vest and neck. The dog shuddered and went slack on top of me.

All around us the woods strobed with muzzle blasts. Men shouted in pain and anger. A dog screamed when somebody caught it behind. Another deputy cried out as one latched onto his forearm. The sound of flesh giving went through the night. He fell under its weight, his weapon clacking away.

“Get it off me,” he yelled. “Get it off.”

The SWAT shotgun barked. The blast hit that dog and knocked it sideways. Hair and meat sprayed into leaves. The deputy’s sleeve hung in tatters, and his arm beneath looked ragged and dark. He clutched it to his chest and tried not to howl.

Rudd fought two at once. One hung on the shield edge. The other held his calf. Blood ran down into his boot tread. He swung the shield into a tree with all he had. Plastic and bark met with a crack. The dog on it slammed between them, ribs popping, then dropped with a gasp. The other would not release his leg. Glass stepped in and pressed his pistol to its skull. The shot snapped the dog’s head sideways and it fell limp.

I rolled the dead weight off my chest and came up on one knee.

Another dog had made it past me and found the SWAT rifleman. It hung off his thigh, teeth sunk deep. His face had gone white. He pounded its head with the rifle butt. The dog only bit deeper.

I shouldered my weapon and tried to find a clean line. Two bodies twisted, tangled. The world narrowed to fur, cloth, and a small window of space near the shoulder.

“Hold,” I shouted.

He heard me and froze his struggle for half a breath. That gave me one angle. I squeezed. The bullet punched through the dog’s skull and buried in the dirt. The animal sagged, jaws still locked.

The rifleman tore it free with both hands and shoved it away. Blood poured from his leg into the leaves.

“Thanks,” he gasped. “Shit. Shit.”

The last of the pack wheeled back and forth, noses full of powder and blood, brains still set on attack. One ran at a shadow and crashed headfirst into a trunk. Another, wounded, dragged itself toward the sound of Jimmy’s yelling and folded before it got there.

Through all of it the motion light stayed on, illuminating everything both left and right like it was searching for who to punish next.

Jimmy took advantage.

Rounds cracked from a back window. Bark exploded. Glass shattered into the old pen where chickens used to roost. A bullet hit the rusted mower and threw sparks.

“Fall back,” the captain yelled over the radio. “All rear units fall back to the tree line. Get our wounded out of there.”

Rudd started to argue, then caught sight of blood running into his boot.

“You heard the man,” he shouted. “Grab your partner and move.”

We retreated. The shotgun man helped the rifleman limp. I hauled another deputy by his vest straps, his boots dragging grooves in the dirt. Leaves stuck to the blood on our pants. We moved tree to tree while shots from the house chased us.

We broke from the woods in a stumbling cluster.

Medics swarmed us and pulled the worst away. They cut pants from legs, yanked boots, wrapped torn flesh. Dog blood and powder smoke clung to everything, smeared helmets, coated plates, stuck to our hands and throats.

I sank against a cruiser and slid down until I sat in gravel. My hands shook so bad I could not unclip my helmet. Rudd dropped beside me, shield propped on his knees.

“Jesus,” he muttered. “He turned his whole house into a kennel.”

I stared at the tree line we had just left. The farmhouse sat in the middle of it all, steady as a stump. From somewhere deep inside, Jimmy started laughing again, long and deep, then high and wild.

Near the Tahoe, Reynolds and a commander from another agency, were already at each other, voices up.

“You sent them in half built,” the commander said. His vest hung open, hair stuck to his forehead. “No armor car, no drone, no nothing. Now we got three chewed on, one near shot, and not a damn thing to show for it.”

That house sat there with traps and corpses and kids inside, while men with brass argued over risk like it was feed prices. Every sentence had liability in it. Every other had policy. 

Rudd and Glass smoked near a cruiser trunk, helmets off, faces bleached by the spin of emergency lights. The SWAT rifleman sat on a bumper with his pant leg cut away, bandage tight on his thigh.

Rudd squinted through smoke. “You hear anything up there?”

“They want to keep us waiting,” I said. “They want a better plan while he keeps talking and decides what he is going to do next.”

Glass drew until the tip glowed, then ground it out under his boot heel. “We lost surprise at the back. We lost it at the front. Only thing we have not lost is time, and that is what they are spending.”

The rifleman tipped his head, eyes on me. “You were out front when he shot the kid.”

“Yes.”

He studied my face a second, then looked back to the house. “How long you think those girls got if we keep waiting on a checklist. You ever see paper stop a bullet?”

Past them the house hunched in its clearing, black against the bowl of dirt. Back windows showed thin strips of yellow through torn curtains. Jimmy’s voice drifted through the boards, talking to somebody in there. 

“Captain won’t green light another push,” Rudd said. “Not after the dogs. Not tonight.”

“He doesn’t have to,” I said.

They both looked at me. The rifleman straightened a little on the bumper.

“We know the yard better now,” I said. “We saw where the wires run. That motion light at the back door covers one strip. We swing wider, count our steps, stay out of that cone. We hit another door toward the rear. Not the kitchen. A side room he is not staring at.”

Glass let out a short huff. “You want to go back in there on your own say so.”

A private part of me wanted to keep sitting in that gravel and let somebody else carry it. Another part, mean and protective, would not let those girls wait while we hid behind procedure.

“I want to go in there because I cannot stand one more hour of hearing him breathe while those kids sit on his floor,” I said. “I keep seeing that boy in the dirt. He is not the last one he will put down if we let him set the pace.”

The rifleman rubbed his thigh, winced, then dropped his hand. “I’m in. I did not put this armor on to stare at bark.”

Rudd cursed and flicked grit off his cigarette filter. “You are all idiots. I’m in too.”

We checked our gear. No one at command watched us. They were back at their charts and calls, jaws gumming, radios busy. I took fresh mags and wiped what blood I could from my grip. We took rifles, pistols, breaching tools.

Hart, the medic who had patched us earlier, saw us peel off toward the tree line. He stepped into our path.

“You got orders for this,” he asked. His attention went from my rifle to my face and back again.

“Yeah,” Rudd said. “Orders to go take a piss. You want to hold our hands.”

Hart looked past him at the house.

“You get shot in there and call for help,” he said, “I don’t know if we’ll reach you in time.”

“Makes sense,” Rudd said. “Doesn’t change the fact we need to take a piss.”

He studied us another count.

“I got two girls at home,” he said. “I would want you to move if I was in a position to ask. Just don’t be stupid.”

He stepped aside.

We slid into the trees again, farther down than before. We counted steps. Twenty, thirty, forty..

The house came back into view from a different angle, rear corner this time. The motion light hung above the kitchen door, a cone of dead glare fixed on the path we had taken before. We stayed at the far edge of shadow where it could not quite reach.

On this side a smaller door rotted under a shallow awning, half hidden by a dead vine. The frame was molded at the bottom. The knob hung loose. No light above it.

Rudd leaned close. “This our hole.”

We stacked tight against the wall. The boards felt damp and gritty through my gloves. The world shrank to old wood.

Glass slid the breacher between jamb and knob and gave one hard pry. The latch gave with a faint crack. The door eased inward a finger width. No alarms. No light.

Rudd pushed it open with his boot. The smell hit first. Sour sweat, dog musk, old grease, mildew, and something deeper that lived in the wood itself, rot that had soaked in and never left. 

We went in.

The floor complained under our weight. The hallway ran small. One wall was bare plank, the other hung with a crooked row of photographs. Faces stared out through dust and grime. Kids at a creek, a woman at a stove, Jimmy younger with a rifle held up for the camera. The frames leaned and the glass looked filmed over, as if even the memories were dirty.

We passed a bathroom with a toilet missing its seat and a tub ringed black. A bedroom door stood half open. Light leaked under it from the front of the house. Voices came from that direction, more than one.

Rudd lifted two fingers and mouthed, “Ahead.”

We moved on it, rifles set, steps measured so the boards did not pop. The nearer we got, the clearer the sounds became. A girl sobbing. Another whispering fast and frantic. Jimmy over them, rasping and sure, the voice of a man who believed he owned the air in the room.

“You sit still,” he said. “You sit right there and you look at me. You think I will let them drag you off to some foster hole? They will pry you out of this house over my dead body.”

We reached the doorway.

The living room opened up under a flat ceiling. A broken couch. A television perched on a milk crate, volume down, screen stuck on a shopping channel with a woman smiling. It was the only clean thing in the place.

On the stained carpet his daughters knelt in a ragged row. I could not tell their ages in that moment, only that they were little and they were hurt. Faces mottled. Cheeks swollen. Lips split. One held the hand of a smaller one so tight her knuckles showed pale.

Their mother sat slumped on the couch behind them. Dark marks striped her neck where something had ridden too tight. Her attention did not lift with us. She looked past all of it, like a person staring through a storm window at a prairie that would not stop flooding.

Jimmy stood between the girls and the front windows, pistol in his hand, shirt soaked through from the wounds he took earlier. Hair stuck to his forehead. His stare was bright and busy. He turned at the sound of our boots.

For a frozen breath none of us spoke. Our sights stayed on his chest. The girls stared at us through tears. He saw the guns, then our faces, then dropped his attention to the nearest daughter.

He smiled.

He raised the pistol and swung it toward her head.

I saw it in pieces. His forearm lifting. The barrel coming down. The girl’s shoulders curling in like she wanted to fold small enough to disappear. I felt my own finger tighten and hated how natural it was, how quick the body chooses when the mind is still begging for a different ending.

Time refuses to put that sequence in order for me. In one version I fire first and his shot never exists. In the true one, his gun spat flame.

The sound of it will stay with me for good.

The closest girl’s hair jumped. A neat hole opened in her forehead, then it widened in the next blink. She pitched forward into the carpet like her strings got cut. Blood spread under her face. The smaller one beside her shrieked and reached for her.

Our volley hit Jimmy. Rifle rounds tore into his chest and shoulder. His body jerked, staggered, but he did not drop. He twisted and fired again, wild and close. The second shot caught another daughter at the side of the neck. She reeled and hit the couch arm.

Their mother screamed and lunged for her, palms already slick from her daughter's spray.

We kept firing. Wood splintered behind him. Glass from the front windows blew inward in hard shards. A round took part of his jaw away. Teeth and bone scattered across the couch cushion. Another punched through his sternum and drove out his back.

He stepped backward into the television. The screen cracked under his weight. He slid down the wall and sat hard on the floor.

Even with half his mouth gone, he tried to speak. Only a wet gargle came. His attention rolled from us to the girls. Then whatever was holding him in that ruined body let go. His head dropped forward, chin to chest, blood spreading around him in a thick pool.

“Cease,” Rudd shouted. “Check the girls.”

We rushed in.

The first girl lay facedown, skull broken, hair matted. No pulse at her throat. No breath under my hand. That part was simple, if anything in that room could be called simple.

The second, the one hit in the neck, still moved. Blood pulsed from the wound in a thin stream now, slower than before. Her stare searched the ceiling without finding it.

“Hand here,” Hart called from the hall. He had come in behind us, eyes locked on the injury. “Press down and don’t let up.”

I clamped my palm over the hole while he worked gauze under my fingers. Heat soaked through. Her breath hitched against my knee. I kept pressure. Hart cinched a bandage tight, hands fast, then shouted for a litter.

The other girls sobbed and clung to each other. One crawled toward her dead sister and had to be held back. The mother tried to stand and her legs quit. She crawled instead, reaching for the daughter under my hands, smoothing her hair with fingers streaked red.

“Baby,” she whispered. “Baby, I’m here.”

Behind us, Glass cleared the kitchen and the back bedroom. No more bodies. No more guns. Only the wreckage of a house where every wall had seen something it was never meant to hold.

Radios erupted.

“House secure.”

“Suspect down.”

“Two juveniles shot.”

“One unresponsive, one critical.”

“Medics to the front now.”

We carried the wounded girl out through the same door her brother had walked through earlier. Dawn had started thinking about rising. A pale band sat at the edge of the pines. The yard was a grave of trampled tracks and blood in different shades of drying. The medic rode the stretcher, one hand still pressed at the bandage on her neck.

The dead girl followed on a board with a sheet over her face.

They took Jimmy out later, what was left of him, zipped in black. His head knocked when they lifted him. The boy went last, stiff, dirt still stuck to his cheek.

By full morning the house stood ventilated by bullets. Windows gone. Door broken. Every room marked and measured. Tape shone in the new light. Press trucks came and parked careful, lenses turned the right direction..

Then the real work began.

Weeks blurred. Interviews. Statements. Diagrams drawn on yellow paper that curled at the corners. Internal Affairs sat me down in a plain room that smelled of old coffee and copier heat and played the recordings back. The 911 call. The radio traffic. The PA. They stopped on every decision and made it a question.

Why did you not fire sooner?

Why did you go with the entry team?

Why did you not wait for orders?

Lawyers asked the same things with worse tongues and better suits.

The mother sat in another room later, neck scarred where a leash had rubbed. Her stare was sunk but dry, like she had cried herself empty. She told her story for a civil suit while her attorney pointed at paperwork and said we escalated, that our bullets killed her child same as his. The claim named every man on that last team. It was thick with words I had only ever heard on the news.

The department spoke. The captain stopped meeting my stare. Command called me in on a Monday and slid a folder across the desk. They dressed it up as restructuring and public trust.

The end was simple. I lost the badge.

They told me they were sorry. They told me it was not personal. They told me they had to protect the office. No one used the word sacrifice. That word belongs to dead kids and bleeding deputies, not to careers.

I signed what they put in front of me. I turned in my my ID. I walked out in plain clothes and did not know what to do with myself.

Now I drive those backroads in my own truck. No radio. No calls. County Road 7 still runs under the pines. Trailers still slump under years. Folks still watch a stranger roll past and then go right back to what they were doing.

People talk about the line, the one between action and restraint, mercy and force. I stood on that line.

It was not a bright stripe.

Hey there. I am pretty introverted and much better with one on one conversations than group chats. Small talk wears me out but real conversations do not.

I live in Michigan and work a hybrid job with odd hours so I am around at random times and usually free to talk. When I am not working I enjoy reading cooking and spending time outdoors when the weather is nice. During winter I lean fully into being a homebody with books shows coffee and quiet nights in.

Ive been single a while and realize how much I miss consistent conversation and connection. I am not rushing anything or forcing expectations. I just want something comfortable and genuine.

If you enjoy chatting and prefer meaningful or even goofy conversations feel free to message me. Tell me what you are currently reading watching or enjoying lately.",1,1767463520.0,IntrovertsChat,1,1.0,False

1q31evo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ROCD/comments/1q31evo/how_rocd_ruined_my_life_suffering_25_years/,How ROCD ruined my life (suffering 2.5 years),"I (M18) have been in a relationship for three years with a wonderful person (F17). We entered the relationship when we were both 14. Before her, I broke up with a girl I had been dating for four months because I instantly clicked with my current partner (let’s call her B).
It started beautifully. I had never felt that way in a relationship before. I genuinely felt like we had so much growth to offer each other, and I was very attracted to her.
The problems started to arise a few months into the relationship. At that time, I was very open-minded. I liked people, their validation, and I liked validating others. I had a lot of friends, both male and female, and I cherished them all—even though some of them weren’t very high-quality people.
B, on the other hand, was very jealous and protective over me. She wanted me to set very strict boundaries with people and cut off girls who were attention-seekers. I was extremely stubborn. I had a very wrong approach to her jealousy and didn’t want to change anything about my lifestyle because I genuinely didn’t see a problem with it.
I believed that it didn’t matter who I was friends with as long as I loved her—and I was sure that I did. Sometimes she would cry for hours because of this, and I would try to comfort her and explain that she had nothing to worry about. I told her that I was hers and only hers, that she was the best thing that had ever happened to me, and that I would never leave her or cheat on her, no matter what.
She said it wasn’t just about cheating, but about mutual respect—something I didn’t fully understand back then.
Fast forward a few months, and I slowly started to accept her boundaries. I wanted to show her that I loved her, so I did cut off a couple of female friends I wasn’t very close with to begin with—girls who talked badly about her and couldn’t respect B’s or my boundaries no matter how many times I asked them to stop. Some of it even crossed physical boundaries (one “friend” once licked my elbow and grabbed my butt as a joke).
Then the summer of 2023 came, and I went to a camp I had been attending every year. I had friends there whom I had known for over five years, and at the time, they were my biggest emotional anchors. Among them was a female friend I regularly spent time with (let’s call her C).
C was my best friend at the time, and B tried very hard to tolerate my friendship with her because she knew how much it meant to me. Around that time, I became aware that B had a serious problem with jealousy, but I had changed my attitude toward it. I wanted to give her reassurance and show her that she wasn’t alone in dealing with it.
I hoped that if I let go of my stubbornness for a while, she would eventually feel more comfortable with my female friendships and that we would meet somewhere in the middle. I know B may sound irrational in this story, but she was very aware of her problem and genuinely wanted us to find a compromise as well.
During that camp, I spent a lot of time with C, as usual. We were rarely alone, and I never intended to be. I truly saw her only as a friend. Since I had known her for so long and had only been with B for about six months at that point, C was one of my biggest sources of emotional support at the time.
I also admired C because I saw qualities in her that I wanted to develop in myself—she was well-read and intellectually curious. The thing is, I had kind of liked C for about a year, around six months before I started dating B. B knew about this.
At one point during the camp, a thought entered my mind: “What if you would be happier in a relationship with C?”
I felt that thought throughout my entire body, and it hurt me deeply. I saw it as confirmation of all of B’s fears and jealousy, and once it appeared, it never truly left my mind. Not as something pleasant, but as something filled with guilt and shame.
Despite this, my relationship with neither B nor C actually changed. It was simply a thought that stayed with me—something that kept me awake at night.

Fast forward a few months after the camp, and the memory of that thought became worse and worse. A whole year passed, and I became so emotionally unstable that I was 100% convinced I had been attracted to C during that camp in 2023.
My relationship with C didn’t really change, but with B, I became very insecure—and she felt it. She felt me losing myself more and more every day, becoming increasingly unsure of myself.
Everything completely fell apart about a year after that camp, when I went to the seaside with my parents for a week and was completely isolated from B. During that time, I started having small anxiety attacks every now and then, and it was unbearable.
In that state, I decided I was going to tell B everything. I thought that even if I ruined our relationship—which I deeply cared about—at least the suffering connected to C would finally stop.
Ironically, at that time B had actually been getting much better with her jealousy. She rarely brought it up anymore. I respected her boundaries, and she almost never complained.
When I came back from that seaside trip, I sat on a bench in a park in front of our school and read her a speech I had prepared. I told her everything—from the feeling that I think I liked C during that camp (not before and not after), to the anxiety surrounding it.
I told her that I hoped she could eventually get past it so we could continue our relationship stronger than ever, because now I could finally let go of the guilt.
She was incredibly hurt. She stood up from the bench and told me she honestly didn’t know what to do anymore, and that she would call me later.
(What I had just told her was her biggest fear.)
A few hours later, she started texting me. That night, she completely tore into me—telling me I was disgusting, that I could have controlled all of this, but was just too lazy to do so.
The only kind thing she said was that she respected me for telling her the truth, because most guys would have kept it to themselves.
As much as it hurt, I felt relief. My nervous system finally calmed down after a year of constant suffering. I saw it as a new beginning, and I felt genuinely hopeful.
A few weeks later, B and I agreed that I would cut all ties with C. It did hurt a little, but it also felt like a completely normal thing to do. I met C for coffee and explained everything to her. She was very understanding, and that was the last time we spoke as friends.
B didn’t actually want to force me into that decision, because she had a male best friend herself and knew how devastated she would be if she had to give him up. Still, I felt like it was the right thing to do, so I told her I would be okay losing C.
A few more weeks passed, and life became strange. Sometimes B was very kind to me, and at other times she would tell me she hated me—that I had ruined something beautiful and that things would never be the same again.
She had emotional outbursts several times a week. It was extremely stressful, but I felt like I had to understand her, because in her eyes, I had fulfilled her worst nightmare.
That was the point at which my ROCD fully took shape.
One day, I walked out of my house and suddenly every woman felt like a threat. I started having intense sexual thoughts about every girl who passed by, and the harder I fought them, the stronger they became.
I was completely emotionally and physically exhausted. I never wanted to keep secrets from B again, so I told her about these thoughts within the same week.
Despite how unstable she was at the time, she tried to calm me down. She said it was probably just my brain scanning for danger after everything that had happened. But she also said it could be that I was simply noticing my sexuality toward other girls more now because I wanted to be more faithful—and that this could actually be a good thing, because now I could work on it.

Fast forward half a year, and I still had the same problem—only it was getting worse. During that time, I cut all ties with all of my female friends.
I obsessively told B about every “bad” thought I had about her and every “good” or sexual thought I had about another girl. I wanted to go to a psychiatrist, but I had so much going on in my life back then that I thought it was unnecessary. I believed the thoughts would eventually go away on their own if I stopped feeding them—I just didn’t know how to do that.
I quit all the activities I cared about if they included girls. Sometimes even watching a movie, a cartoon, or listening to music that included objectively attractive women became frustrating and frightening.
All I wanted was to see only B as beautiful and special. I wanted all other women to disappear from the world—figuratively and literally.
Fast forward a few more months. B and I had gone out the night before with a couple from our class. At that time, I was extremely overwhelmed by my ROCD, school tests, and our relationship.
It had been nine months since the incident involving C, and B and I had actually grown a lot—both individually and together. We were doing well. B had fewer and fewer emotional outbursts about the situation with C, and I had stopped telling her every thought I had. She was fine with that.
But inside, I was slowly decomposing under the stress I experienced every single day. I didn’t even realize how bad I was feeling anymore because I had gotten used to it.
That changed the morning I came home after that night out. All four of us had stayed out all night. I was exhausted and drowsy. I went to take a shower and started masturbating.
During the climax, I saw the face of my friend’s girlfriend—B’s friend, the girl we had gone out with the night before (let’s call her D).
I felt disgusted. The whole thing shook me deeply.
I decided not to tell B because I thought it would be selfish, especially since she had been healing so well lately. However, every time I masturbated after that, the same thing happened—again and again.
I couldn’t understand why. It was true that I saw D every day at school, but I barely ever talked to her. Even when the four of us went out together, I never spoke to her alone—only all four of us together, just B and me, me and her boyfriend or the two of them.
She was objectively attractive, yes. But if it was really that shallow, why couldn’t I masturbate normally without her appearing—even when I was looking at the picture of B?
After a month, I finally told B about it during one moment, because I started feeling the same kind of guilt I had felt about C—and there was no way in hell I was going through that again.
She was very hurt at first. She asked me whether it felt good, and I said no. I mean, I was masturbating, so obviously there was physical pleasure—but it was completely overshadowed by guilt and disgust every time that image appeared.
The next morning, she told me it didn’t matter and that she had just been drunk, so it had hit her harder than it normally would have. She told me to stop giving that thought so much power and that it would go away.
I tried—but it kept happening. Sometimes weaker, sometimes stronger, but every time, even if only for a millisecond.

Fast forward a few more months. B and I were on a holiday for two weeks together. It has now been a full year after I told her about C and two years after I had that thought ""what if i like C better than B""on that camp. Holiday with B is usually the best part of the year, yet, this time as nice as it was, I was just so fucking emotionally exhausted all the time. I couldn't give her all the love she deserved and I couldn't really do anything. I also wasn't attracted to her as I used to be. I set aside all those feelings and I tried to enjoy our time together and I really did, yet, i felt dirty and guilty and I couldn't even put a finger on the reason. The forst week of the holiday we were alone and the second, that couple (D and her bf) came with us. It was fun all and all yet B, again felt my exhaustion and my insecurity so it all ended up very badly last day of the holiday. It wasn't anything specific she was just sad and mad at me because she had a feeling like I just stopped growing, like I stopped giving effort in our relationship while I made our relationship my number one priority. The truth was, I was just to tired and I was giving my best but my best at that time was like 30% of me. 

I also forgot to metion, after my conversation with B about the C, our situation in bed was really bad. Sometimes, I would manage to go 15 mins with no problem which were just enough for her, yet, sometimes I could barely go a minute. She was trying not to make a big deal out of it but after a year, ofc she started begging me to get rid of that problem. 

So again, after holiday, fast forward a few days and I decided I have to talk with B about my intrusive thoughts again because i knew they were the reason for me being so absent minded. I could also go mastrubating 4 times a day to prove myself I love B by not seing picture of D while doing it yet every time it happened. B had a wonderfull reaction. She told me that she doesn't really give a fuck and that i am free to move on. We talked at least like an hour about that and she explained to me a little better what she ment by saying that she NEVER finded anyone attractive during our relationship but me. (A thing she would tell me here and there when she would have a tantrum about my intrusive thoughts or C situation). She told me that she can notice but she doesn't give it meaning. She just says to herself that im better than that guy in every aspect and moves on with the day and then forgets about it. Surprisingly, talking about it for the first time in so long made me the calmest I have been in like at least a year and for a few days, the thoughts have stopped. 

Those few calm days were the last I would experience for a very long time. Then came a school trip — seven days long. At first, everything felt normal. I got on the bus and sat next to B, but I was already nervous and anxious, as that had become my default state.
Then, suddenly, like a demon grabbing my heart, a thought about D became unbearable. I sat there next to B, frozen, while shame, guilt, and fear flooded my body. That thought became something “forbidden,” something overwhelmingly intense, frightening, and strangely exciting. I could not get her face out of my mind no matter what I did. At times, I could barely breathe. On top of that, I was sleeping only two hours a night, drinking constantly, and walking all day through the city as part of the trip.
By the fourth day, I developed a fever and could barely get out of bed, but I kept going with the help of medication. That night, drenched in sweat and shaking from the fever, I felt I had to talk. I told B that I could not stop thinking about D and that it was destroying me, that I was constantly anxious and stressed. She tried to stay calm, but when she asked whether I thought I liked D, I honestly said I did not know. She was shocked and moved to another bed. I promised her that I did not like D and that something was seriously wrong with me — that I was clearly dealing with a mental and emotional illness. That same night, I scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist.
For the rest of the trip, B acted as if nothing had happened. She tried to keep things normal, but our “normal” became her taking control while I stood there completely exhausted. On the last day of the trip, I was so emotionally drained that I felt almost nothing. Then a thought crossed my mind: this cannot be liking someone — this feels like pure anxious obsession. For the first time in a long while, my perspective shifted. I stopped seeing my intrusive thoughts as punishment for a past situation. Maybe that situation was never what I thought it was. Maybe I had suffered for nothing. Maybe I never truly liked anyone else in the first place.
A few days later, I finally came home and slept for nearly 48 hours straight. When B came to see me, I was still devastated. I bought her flowers, and we went on a date without talking about D. We simply enjoyed being together. Later, back at my place, B started crying. We finally addressed what was hanging between us. I told her that I had no idea what I was feeling anymore and that maybe she should break up with me. She told me I was insane — that after everything we had invested, I could not just say that.
I told her that all I ever wanted was to make her happy, but that I felt broken and incapable. We both knew B had very high standards and struggled with the idea of attraction to anyone else within a relationship. We also knew that there were people who could accept that more easily. Still, I could not understand why it was so hard for me when it seemed effortless for B. I shared my theory — that maybe I had issues long before the “C situation,” and that maybe I never truly liked anyone else at all. B told me she did not care anymore. She said she just wanted all of it to stop, that she wanted a future together and for the suffering to end. I told her I wanted that too. That night we had passionate sex, at least i believe it was for her. For me it was beautifull yet increadeably stresfull.
When school started again, I thought my intrusive thoughts would finally calm down now that I understood what they were. They did not. They became worse than ever. Hardly a minute passed without the same thoughts returning. Going to school became exhausting since we were all in the same class. My friendship with D’s boyfriend grew distant, not because of anything real, but because of the guilt I carried. I cried regularly, and focusing in class felt impossible. The harder I tried to concentrate, the louder the anxiety, guilt, and internal noise became.
During that time, I turned to God for the first time in years, after having been an atheist. I was also meditating every night before the trip, but after the breakdown on the school trip, there was no escaping my thoughts, no matter how calm I tried to be. I carried a small ""happy stone"" B had given me for our second anniversary in my pocket day and night, as if it could somehow keep me grounded.

Fast forward a couple of months and I finally started going to therapy, however, it was a free therapy so ig it wasn't very good, I think I was just to deep at that point. However, I put everything aside, relationship with B, my friendships, my hobbys, even school (I am graduating this year and I have to pass the hardest tests in my life by the end of year) and i just tried to understand everything that has happened to me. I have been doing a lot of self-reflection. I was practically surviving day-to-day because I kept thinking about all of this. It isn't like it was all just intrusive thoughts, I was genuanelly trying to figure out all these negative processes i got in a last couple of years. 

Time passed and B's and mine 3rd anneversery came along. I tatooed her name on my arm and I made a graffiti on the wall of our school saying how much i love her. She has grown so much and I am so proud of her. She texted me a few months back and rold me that she is ready to move on from all this hell we went through. She told me that she loves me, she forgives me for everything and that she is begging me to forgive her too. That is all beuarifull and i can see her really moving on from her jelousy and suffering i have caused her. I think i have never actually seen her this well. She is thinking about colleges she wants to go to and is trying to support me anyway she can. We have completely stoppet talking about my ROCD. Partly because she begged me, partly because there is no more purpose in it. It is just hurting both of us. It is giving me a short time reassurance and pain to her so what is the point. She currently knows that I am increadeably fucked up and she wants to help but i just tell her that this is something I have to go through alone. We went to another school trip and simmilar thing happened with another of B's friends only much lesser because I was now more aware of what that shit was. But to conclude i currently have two trigger persons in my life. 

It isn't all so black after all. I talked about my problems with my 50-year old friend, ex trainer. I have talked about it with my dad too. I am figuring things out. Slowly but I do. I recently went deep into researching what ROCD really is. It was releiving realising I was not the only one going throguh this shit. Especially the part that ROCD can make you feel things stronger than you usually would. I am trying to accept that there is always gonna be someone more or less anything than B and that i should be okay with it. I realised that I am really sensitive. I realisied that true love is SO MUCH deeper than just sexual energy or looks. I mean, I always knew that but ROCD made it all SOOO important. Sexuality and looks became proof of love and if i wasn't feeling it enogh towards B, or if i felt attraction to someone else, any kind of it, even the smallest, in my head i became a cheater. It is possible I will soon go talking about all of this with someone more specialised in anxiety and OCD but I am actually not sure if I even need it anymore. I mean, I have all the answers I just don't know how to find the balance between being okay to find other girls attractive and making it unimportant and fulfilling B's ecpectations of her being the only one in my eyes (which she ofc is, I am just a bit confused and sick). 

So there you have it. This is one long story about how ROCD ruined my life and made my teenage years so much more miserable then they should have been. If anyone made it to the end, thank you for reading it. I hope you will find some peace in it knowing you are not alone or hopefully, help me find my peace. The story isn't over yet but I was at a hangout with B and some of our friends (including trigger persons like D) and you know what? It wasn't so scary anymore. I hope I will one day be able to show this to B and tell her it is all over and more of all, i hope she will understand because there is noone and nothing more important in this world than she is to me. I hope we will marry and have kids together and I hope I will one day just remeber this and be like: ""Yeah, that were some weird time haha""

We share a break room and the coffee amenities that are in it. That includes a fancy coffee machine, a lot of mugs, and a dishwasher for said mugs.

The coffee machine needs to be cleaned daily so that the milk inside does not curdle overnight. This means running the cleaning cycle and opening the machine to wash some of the individual components inside. The office has a weekly rotation for the coffee cleaning duty. Managers are exempt from that duty, so the common worker like me is typically in charge of cleaning the coffee machine for a week every few months.

On top of that, everyone leaves their dirty mugs in the kitchen sink and the person on rotation is expected to load and unload the dishwasher multiple times a day so that everyone has clean mugs at all times. On days when the managers have business visitors, this can add up to a lot of mugs to cater to the visitors' coffee needs.

I understand that the coffee machine and mugs are a common amenity and I agree that if you use them, you should contribute. That said, I do not drink coffee. It is a well-known fact among my coworkers that I dislike coffee, they even joke about it. I do not use the coffee machine, be it for coffee, hot chocolates, or even hot water. I don't even use the mugs. I prefer drinking juice, sodas, or water that I bring with me every morning in my own containers (bottles or tumblers).

I asked to be kept off of the cleaning rotation, since I don't use the coffee machine and most likely never will. I find it a bit ridiculous to only touch the coffee machine to clean it, and to be asked to clean after everyone for something I'll never use. 

My coworkers are split on that matter. Some agree with me, others say that I should contribute to ""living in society"" regardless and do it to keep the peace. I'd argue that they have a vested interest in me participating so that they can clean less often.

I am aware that this is just a coffee machine, and I'd be cleaning it for just a week every few months, but the principle of it bothers me.

1q31cl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1q31cl1/theres_something_down_there_beneath_the_rig_part_1/,There's something down there beneath the rig (part 1),"My name is **Evan Calder**, and I work in marine research along the Gulf Coast. I don’t usually write about my fieldwork outside of reports and internal reviews, but what happened off that rig never made it into anything official, and it hasn’t stopped following me since.

I was still reviewing the files when the helicopter cleared the coastline and the Gulf opened up beneath us. From that height, the water looked uniform—flat, reflective, almost empty in a way that makes it easy to forget how much of it we never see.

My work usually keeps me behind screens and datasets. I specialize in tagging and long-term movement studies, mostly sharks, mostly in areas where human infrastructure overlaps with migration routes. When a tag stops transmitting, there’s usually a reason. Batteries fail. Sharks die. Predators eat predators. The data almost always tells you which one it was.

This time, it didn’t.

The tags had been deployed off a single oil rig in the Gulf, spaced out over several months. Structures like that are ideal for long-term tagging work. They function as artificial reefs, pulling in baitfish, which draws in larger predators and creates predictable movement corridors that are easier to monitor over time.

Sharks linger around rigs longer than they do in open water, which makes tag retention higher and data cleaner. You get consistent depth profiles, repeat passes, and fewer variables than you would along a migratory route. It’s one of the few places in the Gulf where you can reasonably expect the same animals to come back.

That’s why the pattern stood out. Three tags from the same rig showed the same failure signature before going dark: a sudden spike in temperature, followed by a rapid drop, and then silence. One case was eventually attributed to predation by a large mako—rare, but still within what we’d expect. The others never resolved cleanly.

What pushed it out of routine review was the cost. The tags weren’t cheap, and in real life we don’t replace them out of a general budget. Most of our work is funded through short-term grants, often from multiple sources at once, and every piece of equipment is accounted for in advance.

Losing one tag is frustrating. Losing several from the same site starts to look like a failure of planning. It affects renewal applications, future approvals, and whether you’re trusted to run the next project at all.

By the time the third tag went dark, the conversation had shifted from *why the sharks were behaving oddly* to *whether we could justify continuing the study*. The oil company cared about liability. My department cared about credibility. I was sent out there because someone needed an answer that didn’t end with the project being shut down.

The rig had its own reasons for wanting answers. Liability was part of it, but not all. Offshore operations like this are bound by strict environmental and conservation regulations, and any indication that their infrastructure was harming protected species could cost them far more than a few lost tags. If the rig was influencing shark behavior in a way that led to repeated fatalities, it wouldn’t just be my project that got shut down.



They’d already taken a financial hit months earlier when a remotely operated vehicle went missing near the same section of pipeline. The report concluded it had become caught on subsea structure during a routine inspection. When the surface team attempted retrieval, the tension on the line spiked beyond tolerance and the cable snapped.

The feed cut out immediately after. Whatever had the ROV didn’t let go when it was pulled.

It was a multi-million-dollar unit, written off as an accident after the loss was attributed to structural entanglement and equipment failure. No recovery attempt was made beyond the initial pull. The remains were never located.

I wasn’t especially alarmed by that at the time. ROVs get damaged more often than people think. Sharks have been bumping, biting, and harassing them for decades, and large cephalopods have a long history of grabbing at anything with lights and moving parts.

ROVs are still one of the primary tools used to study squid, and I remembered watching footage years earlier when researchers finally recorded a giant squid in the Arctic, the camera barely catching the edge of something enormous before it slipped back into the dark.

And just as often, losses come down to human error. A bad approach angle. A misjudged clearance. Someone pulling too hard on a line that should have been cut instead. Subsea infrastructure is cluttered, uneven, and unforgiving. Things get stuck. Cables snap.

That was the explanation I defaulted to. It was cleaner. Familiar. Easier to justify than the alternative, which at the time didn’t even feel worth articulating.

The diver was handled the same way. The report stated he’d shown signs consistent with nitrogen narcosis—disorientation, impaired judgment, panic. It wasn’t an unreasonable explanation. I’d seen it before. Nitrogen sickness is one of the first things you’re taught to respect when you work with scuba and mixed-gas systems, drilled into you during briefings until it becomes instinct. People underestimate it, push limits they shouldn’t, and sometimes they don’t come back. Plenty of experienced divers have died that way.

What made that explanation sit wrong with me was the equipment.

The suits used on that rig weren’t just upgraded dive gear. They were developed specifically to reduce reliance on hyperbaric habitats altogether. Anyone who’s spent time around offshore work knows the history—decades of accidents tied to saturation systems, pressure failures, and human error compounding in sealed environments. The technology was meant to eliminate that risk entirely. No long-term saturation. No living under pressure for weeks at a time. No catastrophic decompression scenarios that turn a single mistake into multiple fatalities.

It was considered a breakthrough when it rolled out. Active pressure regulation, continuous neurological monitoring, automated gas balancing—systems designed to manage nitrogen buildup dynamically instead of relying on static decompression schedules. The idea was that if something started to go wrong, the suit would catch it before the diver ever noticed.

I remember feeling more annoyed than alarmed when I read the report. Not because the technology had failed, but because it was being used the way it always is—deployed first for industrial labor instead of exploration. Oil workers got access to equipment most research teams could only dream of, and even then, the official explanation was that it had simply… missed something.

The logs showed nothing had triggered an alert. No pressure anomaly. No neurological flags. No recorded failure of any kind.

I told myself that didn’t mean much. Accidents happen. Reports get written to close cases, not reopen them. What did catch my attention was the suit. When I was told the expedition was moving forward and that I’d be going down myself, it came with a condition: I had to be certified on their systems first.

The Gulf research facility required it before they’d even sign off on my involvement, and the rig wasn’t comfortable sending anyone down in one of those suits without documented training. Most of it was simulations—hours in controlled environments, pressure modeling, emergency drills meant to familiarize you with systems that were designed to intervene before you ever needed to react. Still, it was more hands-on time with technology like that than most researchers ever get.

Even then, they made it clear I wouldn’t be alone. The rig assigned one of their experienced divers to accompany me, someone who’d already logged multiple descents in the same equipment. That reassurance should have tempered my expectations. Instead, it did the opposite.

I’d spent years studying the ocean through numbers, recordings, and secondhand footage. Whatever was happening beneath that rig, I was finally going to see it directly—and this time, I’d be wearing the kind of suit that wasn’t supposed to let anything go wrong.

As the helicopter banked toward the platform, I remember thinking the explanation would probably be a familiar one. Sharks aggregate around structure. Predators follow prey. Sometimes the ocean just doesn’t give you your answers back.

I’d seen the rig plenty of times before, usually from the deck of a research vessel, craning my neck upward as it rose out of the water like a piece of misplaced skyline. Being brought in level with it felt wrong in a way I couldn’t immediately articulate. There was no gradual approach, no sense of scale building over distance. One moment it was a silhouette on the horizon, and the next it filled my vision completely.

The helicopter dropped hard onto the pad. The rotors were still slowing when I stepped out, the air thick with heat, fuel, and the low vibration that seemed to travel up through the soles of my boots. Everything on the rig felt louder at that distance, even the quiet movements.

The diver assigned to me was already crouched near the edge of the pad, one hand braced against the deck, the other shielding his helmet from the wash as the blades spun down. It was a posture I recognized instinctively, the kind you take around heavy machinery without thinking about it. He didn’t look up until the noise fell away.

“Careful,” the man crouched near the edge of the pad said. “They’ll knock you on your ass if you let them.”

I ducked instinctively. He waited until the blades slowed, then stood and stepped toward me, moving with the kind of ease that comes from long familiarity with heavy machinery. He was shorter than I expected, compact, built dense rather than large, his skin darkened by sun and salt in a way that didn’t fade evenly. His suit was already half on, sleeves tied at the waist, helmet clipped under one arm and scuffed enough to suggest it had been dropped more than once.

He stuck out a hand. “Name’s **Cole**.”

I shook it. His grip was firm, brief, professional.  
 “Evan,” I said. “They told me you’d be going down with me.”

“That’s the idea.” He glanced past me at the tablet still in my other hand. “You get everything you need in there?”

“I’m still going over the files,” I said. “Just want to make sure I—”

“Yeah,” he cut in gently, slipping an arm around my shoulders and steering me away from the pad. Not forceful. Not impatient. Just practiced. “You can do that inside.”

I let myself be guided, surprised by how natural it felt. From this angle, the rig felt exposed in a way I wasn’t used to—too much open space between steel and sky, too much water visible all at once.

“You won’t get much use out of those down here anyway,” Cole went on, nodding back toward the tablet. “Things don’t always line up the way they’re supposed to.”

“They usually do,” I said, more out of habit than conviction. “At least statistically.”

He snorted, a quick sound that might have been a laugh. “Sure they do.”

We paused just long enough for him to look me over, checking my gear with a glance rather than his hands. Satisfied, he gave my shoulder a light squeeze before letting go.

“Come on,” he said. “I’ll show you where you’re getting suited up.”

Cole kept an arm hooked loosely around my shoulders as we moved off the pad and into the rig, steering me through a low doorway and down a short set of steps.

“You duck here,” he said.

“I am ducking,” I replied, immediately smacking my shoulder on a beam anyway.

He grinned. “You weren’t.”

The suiting area smelled like oil, old rubber, and something burned that never quite went away. The walls were cluttered with lockers and peeling safety placards, most of them sun-faded or partially torn. Someone had taped a handwritten sign over one that read *CHECK SEALS BEFORE ENTRY*, the word *BEFORE* underlined twice like it had been added after the fact.

Cole finally let go of my shoulder and clapped his hands once. “Alright. Home sweet hell.”

A voice drifted over from the comms station. “You bringin’ me another one or is this the same skinny scientist from the email?”

The woman at the console leaned back in her chair, cigarette glowing between her fingers. The chair itself looked older than the rig, duct tape holding one armrest together. Behind her, the wall was plastered with laminated emergency procedures, a faded calendar from two years ago, and a cartoon print of a diver shaking hands with a shark that someone had scrawled *DON’T* underneath in marker.

“That’s him,” Cole said. “Be nice.”

She snorted. “I am bein’ nice.” Her eyes dragged over me slowly. “You look lighter in person.”

“I—”

“You gonna float away in one of those suits?” she continued. “They got enough ballast in there for you, sweetheart?”

“I’ve passed the fit tests,” I said, automatically.

“Oh, I’m sure you have,” she replied, tapping ash into a dented coffee can that had *MOMMA* scratched into the side. She stuck out a hand without standing. “Marla. Everybody calls me Big Momma. I sit here, I listen to you breathe, and I tell people upstairs whether to worry.”

I shook her hand. “Evan.”

She nodded once. “We’ll see how long you keep that calm voice.”

A loud metallic clatter cut through the room. At the far end, a younger man with a thick red beard was bent over the open shell of the ROV, half his tools spread across a stained workbench. A sticker on the side read *HANDLE WITH CARE*, mostly obscured by old grease.

“Jonah,” Big Momma called out. “Say hi before you break somethin’ expensive.”

He didn’t look up. “I’m already breakin’ somethin’ expensive.”

Cole laughed. “That’s his happy place.”

Jonah finally glanced over, eyes flicking from me to Cole and back to the ROV. “You the biologist?”

“That’s me.”

He nodded once. “Don’t touch anything unless I tell you to. And if I tell you to touch something, don’t.”

“Comforting,” I said.

“Good,” he replied, already back to work.

Big Momma stubbed out her cigarette and slid her headset back into place. “Alright, boys. Enough socializin’. If he’s gonna get cold feet, I’d rather it happen before he’s zipped into half a million dollars’ worth of suit.”

Cole clapped his hands again. “You heard her. Clothes off. Questions later.”

I opened my mouth to respond, then stopped. Everyone was already moving—Cole toward the lockers, Jonah back to the ROV, Big Momma turning to her screens like I’d already faded into background noise.

And without really deciding to, I followed.

Cole pointed me toward an open locker and started unfastening his own gear without ceremony.

“Down to your base layer,” he said. “Everything else stays here.”

I hesitated, then did as instructed, stripping out of my clothes and folding them onto the bench. The air felt colder without them, the steel deck biting through my socks.

Big Momma let out a sharp whistle from the comms station. “Well I’ll be damned,” she said. “You really *are* built like a research grant.”

I froze halfway through pulling on the thin inner suit. “I’m not—”

“She’s married,” Cole said calmly, stepping into his own underlayer. “And she does that to everybody.”

“Only the ones who look like they’re about to pass out,” Big Momma shot back.

“I’m not nervous,” I said, a little too quickly.

Cole glanced at me, expression unreadable. “Good. Don’t start now.”

The inner suit clung tight once it was on, thinner than I expected, more like a second skin than protective gear. It zipped cleanly up my spine with a faint hiss as it sealed, the material cooling as it adjusted. It felt clinical. Temporary.

Jonah straightened from the ROV and looked over. “You two done preenin’?”

Cole tugged his gloves tight and gave him a nod. “We’re ready.”

“Ready for what?” I asked.

Jonah didn’t answer right away. He just reached over and slapped a switch mounted to the wall.

Something overhead came alive.

The room filled with the low, grinding whine of motors engaging, followed by the heavy clatter of chains and pulleys. I instinctively stepped back as the ceiling panels split apart, revealing a dark mechanical recess I hadn’t noticed before.

Then the suits started coming down.

They were enormous. Far larger than anything I’d seen in the simulations. Thick-limbed, rigid, suspended in their harnesses like something halfway between machinery and anatomy. Plates of matte composite overlapped along the torso and arms, scuffed and scarred from use. The helmets were faceless, opaque, the visors dark enough that they reflected the room instead of revealing anything inside.

I stared at them, my mouth dry. “They didn’t look like that in training.”

“No,” Cole said quietly, watching them descend. “They never do.”

The suits settled onto their mounts with a deep, resonant thud that I felt more than heard. The machinery wound down, leaving the room suddenly, uncomfortably quiet.

Big Momma cleared her throat. “Alright, boys. Let’s get you dressed for the part where you stop bein’ theoretical.”

I swallowed and stepped forward, the weight of the suit looming over me.

For the first time since I’d arrived on the rig, the excitement I’d been carrying shifted into something heavier—something closer to understanding just how small I was about to become.

A sharp chime cut through the room, followed by the faint crackle of the intercom.

“All hands,” a voice said overhead. It was calm, practiced, the kind of tone you use when you’ve said the same words before. “A brief ceremony will be held later today to honor the diver we lost earlier this year. Details will be posted outside the mess hall.”

The line went dead.

For a moment, no one spoke. Even the hum of the machinery seemed to pull back, as if it were listening too.

I glanced at Cole. “You knew him?”

He didn’t answer right away. He was already moving, stepping toward the suit behind me and bracing one hand against its spine.

“Yeah,” he said finally. “I did.”

The word *friend* came a second later, quieter. Final.

“Oh,” I said. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to—”

“It’s fine.” His voice was even, but something in his posture had gone rigid. “You ready?”

I hesitated. “If you don’t want to talk about—”

Cole reached up and pulled a recessed handle along the back of the suit. With a low mechanical hiss, the rear plating split apart and folded outward, revealing the hollow interior.

“Step in,” he said.

Up close, the suit was worse. The inside was cramped and dark, lined with padding and cables that hung loose like waiting hands. The opening wasn’t wide enough to feel welcoming. It was just enough.

I swallowed and stepped closer. “They didn’t show us this part in training.”

“They don’t,” Cole said. He placed a steadying hand on my back, firm and impersonal. “Keeps people from overthinkin’ it.”

I climbed in, the suit swallowing me piece by piece as my boots locked into place with a dull click. The interior smelled faintly metallic, filtered air and old oil, nothing organic but still unpleasantly intimate.

Cole leaned in, adjusting the inner seals with practiced speed. I could hear my own breathing louder now, amplified by the suit’s interior.

“I didn’t mean to bring it up,” I said, unsure why I felt the need to explain myself.

Cole didn’t look at me as he worked. “You didn’t.”

The back of the suit began to close. Panels folded inward, slow and deliberate, sealing me off from the room inch by inch. The last thing I saw was Cole’s face, unreadable in the low light.

The suit locked with a heavy, final clunk.

Inside, the noise dropped away to a muted hush.

I stood there, suspended in something that felt less like equipment and more like being *contained*, and wondered when exactly I’d stopped being a person they talked to and started being something they were sending down.

I caught movement in the corner of my eye as Cole stepped into his suit. One moment he was beside me, the next he was gone, swallowed cleanly as the rear plating folded shut behind him. He didn’t hesitate. He never did.

Jonah walked the line between us, eyes sharp, fingers raised one at a time in front of Cole’s visor.  
 “Count for me.”

“Three,” Cole said.

Jonah nodded, moved to me, and repeated the gesture.  
 “How many?”

“Three,” I replied.

He stepped back, satisfied, then turned to Cole and lifted a single finger—his middle one.

Cole laughed, the sound muffled through the suit. “Real professional.”

Jonah grinned and turned back toward me. Before I could brace, he slapped the front of my visor with an open palm.

The sound detonated inside my helmet, sharp and immediate, like someone clapping next to my ear. I flinched hard, heart spiking.

“Jesus—”

“Good,” Jonah said. “You can hear.” He tapped the visor again, lighter this time. “Don’t zone out down there.”

Before I could respond, the suit chimed softly and the interior lit up.

Big Momma’s voice filled the helmet, warm and close in a way that made the room outside feel very far away.  
 “Alright, boys. Comms are live. If you can hear me, don’t answer—I already know.”

A translucent display bloomed across my visor, clean and bright. Depth gauges, oxygen levels, heart rate. A small video window opened to my left, playing a schematic of the seafloor beneath the rig.

“Primary objective,” Big Momma continued, her voice steady. “Descent to forty-eight hundred feet. Once you’re down, you’ll proceed along the **South Spur Line** until you reach the junction point.”

The video zoomed in, highlighting a cluster of pipelines converging at a single spot. Red markers pulsed faintly around it.

“That location sits at the center of every shark tag loss we’ve recorded off this rig,” she said. “You’ll document any unusual structural damage, biological activity, or debris fields. Keep it slow. Keep it boring.”

The video cut out, replaced by a checklist that scrolled past my peripheral vision.

“Secondary objectives,” Big Momma went on. “If conditions allow, attempt to locate the ROV or what remains of it. Do not attempt retrieval without clearance. Visual confirmation only.”

A pause.

“And before you ask,” she added, “no, we don’t expect to find much.”

Cole’s voice came through my headset, calm as ever. “Copy that.”

“Copy,” I echoed, my own voice sounding smaller than I expected inside the suit.

Jonah stepped back toward the ROV, already focused on his controls. “Don’t scratch my robot,” he muttered.

Big Momma sighed theatrically. “He means *good luck*.”

The displays settled into place, the green indicators holding steady. Somewhere beneath the hum of the suit’s systems, I felt the floor vibrate as larger machinery came online.

“Alright,” Big Momma said. “You’re green across the board. Let’s go see where all that expensive data disappeared to.”

The last thing I saw before the lights dimmed was Cole turning his helmet slightly toward mine.

“You good?” he asked.

I nodded, even though he couldn’t see it.  
 “Yeah,” I said.

“Hey,” I said, suddenly aware of how still everything had gone. “Where’s the elevator?”

Jonah let out a short laugh, the sound crackling faintly through comms.

Cole didn’t.

“You’re standin’ on it,” he said.

Before I could ask what that meant, something shifted beneath my boots.

There was a deep hydraulic hiss, low and powerful, and the deck plates under us split apart. Thick metal grating slid back, revealing dark water far below, the surface broken only by slow, rolling light from the setting sun. We were higher than I’d realized—far higher—and the distance between us and the ocean suddenly felt obscene.

My heart slammed into my chest. “What the *fuck* is this?” I shouted.

My HUD lit up instantly, heart rate spiking red.

“Evan, breathe,” Big Momma’s voice cut in, sharp now. “You’re not droppin’. Nobody’s droppin’. Slow it down.”

It didn’t help. My lungs felt too big for my chest, breaths coming fast and shallow as the platform beneath us began to move.

The entire section of floor we were standing on—me and Cole—started lowering away from the suit room itself. The walls didn’t move with us. The room stayed where it was, and we didn’t.

Big Momma and Jonah rose in my field of view as we descended, their figures framed by steel and fluorescent light. Jonah lifted one hand in a lazy wave. Big Momma met my eyes through the visor, her expression unreadable, professional, already somewhere else.

Then the room was gone.

The rig’s underbelly slid into view above us, a sprawling lattice of steel and shadow, silhouetted against the orange glow of the Gulf sunset. Beyond it, the ocean stretched out in every direction, calm and endless, the surface rippling far below like something alive.

The wind picked up as we cleared the structure, the platform continuing its slow, deliberate descent.

I swallowed hard, my breathing finally beginning to steady as the numbers on my display crept back toward green.

Cole stood beside me, unmoving, looking out over the water like this was just another shift.

The platform shuddered as it met the water.

Spray burst up through the grating, cold and sharp, droplets streaking across my visor before the suit’s systems cleared them away. The sound changed immediately—wind and open air replaced by the dense, muffled pressure of water closing around us.

“Contact,” Big Momma said in my ear. “Nice and easy.”

The surface lingered just above my head for a second longer than I expected, sunlight rippling and bending into fractured gold. The oil rig loomed overhead, its shadow stretching across the water like a stain.

Then we dipped below.

The light dimmed fast, colors bleeding out of the world as the surface sealed itself overhead. My HUD adjusted automatically, depth ticking downward in steady increments. The Gulf swallowed the sunset without ceremony.

The water grew darker. Quieter.

Above us, the last trace of daylight collapsed into a pale smear before vanishing entirely.

I remember thinking then that everything up to that moment had still felt optional.

Now, there was only down.

Since then, I’ve applied pretty broadly to government positions and courts at both the state and federal level, along with some mid size and small firms. So far, I’ve mostly gotten rejections or silence. I’ve also been networking consistently through alumni outreach, coffee chats, and cold emails, but nothing has turned into an offer yet.

At this point I’m not set on BigLaw at all. I’m just trying to find a solid legal job where I can build experience and not completely stall my career right out of law school.

I’m trying to get a realistic sense of where I stand. How bad is this situation actually? What paths should I be focusing on right now that still have real chances this late in the game? For people who were in a similar spot, what strategies ended up working?

Appreciate any honest advice.

For 90% pourover...probably,"Per the title, I'm currently running a Baratza Encore with a V60/Kalita Wave and enjoying the pourover I get from that. However I'd definitely like to upgrade my grinder as I can tell I'm running up against its limits. I like fruity, sweet, juicy, and floral coffees - especially fruit bombs/blueberry bombs. Currently I just get coffee from a Rogue Wave subscription, although I'm local to Luna and so would like to try them out at some point... Although I probably want to upgrade my grinder so it can make the most of those.

  
Based on what I've read, I feel like the ZP6 is likely what I'd enjoy the most. However, I recognize that it is rather specific in its profile and I worry I'd want something to plug the gaps for the few beans that it isn't as great at highlighting. Something with a more general profile like the Q/Q air seems appealing to me for that (and then also having a travel/camping grinder). Especially as the Q + ZP6 costs a similar amount to a K-Ultra.

  
Would this be a good combo, or am I making things more complicated and I should just bite the bullet and get a K-Ultra and have something that's great enough for everything ? I imagine any one of thse would be a huge upgrade over the Encore in any case.

  
To add a wrinkle to this, my wife's been hinting she'd like an espresso machine at some point. If we do end up going that route, I suppose that skews me further towards a K-ultra, although there's always gonna be a voice in my head that wonders what a ZP6 is like...",2,1767463108.0,pourover,4,1.0,False

Personal Reflection
Messaged my ex unexpectedly.
We talked and planned to meet tomorrow (her suggestion).
She asked if I liked her the way I used to.
I said yes.
She clarified that she has a boyfriend.
I asked if she was happy in her relationship.
She blocked me after that.
I genuinely want her to be happy—that was my only intention.
On reflecting honestly:
I am not sure what I wanted from that relationship.
I think it was mostly a physical attachment, not emotional from my side.
She was genuinely nice to me, and I did not handle the breakup the right way.
At this point, I feel relationships may not be for me.

1q317zw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1q317zw/im_a_terrible_apparently_borderline_abusive/,i’m a terrible (apparently borderline abusive) boyfriend. how do i become less shitty?,"this is a follow up. original post for context:

(i know the title sounds baity but bear with me, and i’m aware im gonna sound a bit like a dick. i (23m) have been dating my girlfriend (22f) for about 2 years now. we met through a college presentation group and i liked her pretty much immediately since she was the only person in that group that wasn’t either a control freak or a fucking deadbeat. we got on pretty good, i asked her if she wanted to get coffee together and yadayadayada were dating now. 

it’s been going pretty good imo. she doesn’t nag, she doesn’t argue, she lets me pick where we eat and she’s always happy about it (not in the i’ll let you pick then ill bitch about it later way). shes a smokeshow, n really really soft spoken and gentle and feminine and all that shit. she’s the best ive ever had sex-wise, and that’s saying a lot considering  i have a lot to compare her to. she gives the most killer blowjobs you can imagine and her body’s insane. she cares about my interests and always gives me space when i want and takes care of me like im her baby (not even in an overbearing way). she shows me off to her friends and ive never once seen her eye another guy.  she communicates clearly and always apologizes when she’s wrong and she never creates shit out of nothing. shes affectionate and really lovey dovey and gives physical and verbal affection unprompted, which im not really used to. she’s funny and well liked and she’s wonderful to be around and i really do love her.

i’m naturally a really cynical guy and i tend to always think the worst of people who are practically perfect on the surface, but this isn’t even honeymoon period behavior because she’s like this to everyone, and shes never once shown any ‘true colors’ throughout the time we’ve been together.


i don’t know why, but something about how picture perfect fairy-taleish she is irks me really bad. i’ve tried explaining this shit to my friends before but they always say i’m just trynna find something to complain about but im really not. everytime i yell or something, she just looks sad and never yells back and tries to ‘calm me down’ like im some big bad guy, and it’s even worse when she cries or some shit. i admit i do have a bit of a temper but still.

i don’t wanna feel like im dating some fairy that i have to be as good to her as she is to me. it makes me feel like fucking shit. it’s like she’s putting this unspoken pressure on me to be this perfect boyfriend when i’m literally not capable of that and it pisses me off to no end. i know it sounds fucked but it’s really how i feel. i’ve been snapping at her a lot and ive been really passive aggressive when she’s honestly done nothing to deserve. i told one of my guys that im thinking of breaking up with her over it, and he told me id be a fucking dumbfuck to do that, but i don’t even know. 

i know she’d be really heartbroken if i broke up with her since i know she really really loves me but she’s honestly too much for me, but then again i feel like ill never find a girl as good as her ever again. what the fuck am i supposed to do here?


throwaway account for obvious reasons.)

https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/s/SbrnmrTFAh


now, as a follow up, i’ve thought about the comments on that post, and what ive basically inferred is that im a dick. i never really thought i could be considered abusive, but i guess im not always the most self aware.

i don’t want to break up with her honestly, and i don’t think she would want that either, so i think i need to just become less shitty. all the comments under the original post were just calling me a dick, which isn’t really helpful considering this is an advice subreddit, so i’m asking again.

how do i become less shit? recommendations for good therapists in beverly hills would be great, but other than that, i want practical shit to do until i find one. i seriously hate just feeling like im an asshole all the time.

I don’t really go here but some movie level shit is going on in my life and I don’t know what to do with myself. Growing up I (M19) was raised by my Dad (M40) and Grandparents, and only saw my Mom (F44) maybe once every couple months. She didn’t live with us, and since she and my dad were never married she didn’t get visitation or anything. As far as I was told, my mom and dad met at a music festival, had a casual on again off again relationship, and got back in touch when my mom found out she was pregnant. She moved in with my dad and his folks during the latter part of the pregnancy, but when I was a few months old she got a new boyfriend and moved in with him. My mom was never exactly shy about not wanting kids, and thought it’d be funny to tell a 7 year old me that I was an accident before my dad had the opportunity to break that fact to me gently. I’d be lying if I said that didn’t mess me up a bit, but it’s not like all that drama controlled my life or anything. It’s just kind of a thing.



I recently moved out of my family home into a small 2-bed with a friend from high school, just an hour from where I grew up. Last weekend my roommate texted me while I was at work saying that some older guy came by asking for me. Let’s call him George (M43). He knew my full name and everything. My roommate turned him away, but the guy left his phone number. From a brief description of George, he didn’t sound like anyone I knew, and I was honestly pretty freaked out about the whole ordeal. Well, when I got home, my curiosity got the better of me and I texted the number. I asked who he was, how he knew me, and how he found out where I lived. He said my Mother told him, which made me feel some sorta way since I haven’t seen or spoken to my mom since I graduated last year. He gave me his name and said he was married to my mom before I was born, and that there was something he wanted me to know. I was never told my mom was a divorcee, but I didn’t immediately disbelieve him. I agreed to meet him under the condition that I could bring my roommate and meet at a secondary location.   
  
The three of us got coffee together, and he brought along a suitcase full of papers, pictures, and other miscellaneous stuff. To make a long ass story short, George was married to my mom from 2001 to 2005 and had the receipts to back it up. They were young, the marriage wasn’t happy, the bedroom was dead, and in June of 2005 he found out she was pregnant. She refused to confess to an affair but he just knew that the baby wasn’t his. She left and they only spoke through lawyers after that. He never asked about the baby, the real father, or anything because the thought of the woman he thought he’d be buried next to having another man's baby without telling him made him sick. He moved on, remarried, and has 2 kids now. Apparently my mom had asked him for money earlier this month, the first time they had spoken in over a decade. He said that text had transported him to that time in his life where the infidelity was still fresh and eating him alive. Instead of chewing her out for contacting him, he simply asked about what happened to the affair partner and, most importantly, the baby. She told him the story I had always heard, she moved in with him for about a year before leaving him to raise their son. She made it clear that I was never told about him or the affair. George did all of this because he wanted closure, and I deserved to know. We didn’t say much after that, he paid for our coffee and left. I still have his number but idk if I’ll ever talk to him again. I don’t even know if my dad knows about the affair. I don’t know what I’d do if he did know this whole time and left out the crucial detail that I was born because he slept with a married woman. I can’t say I’ve lost much respect for my Mom because I already knew that she was a cheating joke of a human being but I want to believe my Dad is better than that. He was young, it was a fling, whatever, but if he knew this whole time and never told me I don’t know if I’d forgive him. I feel dirty, in a weird way. Even more so than before, I feel like I wasn’t supposed to exist and I only do exist because my Mom slept around at a music festival of all things. I haven’t told anyone and can only talk to my room mate since they were present for the whole conversation. I’m not sure if I’m asking for advice or what but I just feel kinda haunted right now. I went into work the next day as if my whole world wasn’t set off-kilter and have spent the days since in limbo. Jesus christ.",4,1767462408.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,0.83,False

I had some belly fat always, but just stopped bothering at some point. Then I became thin effortlessly, just was active and stress free, belly disappeared. I liked walks, I would do it for pleasure. And big distances. Spontaneously. I would even eat not too healthy, but still stayed within my normal sizes. But at point I was really overworked and I had psychosis. Had schizophrenia where I would barely move and pray like for 2 years. I have gained weight. Became overweight. I understand it, it is quite normal because I was not active at all. I would eat poorly also, as I had no money. I became a person who usually would not want to move. And I don't understand what is going on. Now I am back to life, I have work which helps me stay active. I would move plenty. I eat quite balanced meals because I work at school and they give us food 3 times a day. I am often very tired after work, so I compensate with some treat and coffee before my commute home. But I am feeling that my natural activity is not increasing and the weight dropped very little, especially from the belly. The most basic answer is to diet and exercise. Stay in deficit. But I remember times when I could afford some dieting, I would be fainting from that lack of calories, I could not think, function, I was letargic and sleepy. And slept alot, even during day. Now I definitely can't afford this luxury to be walking dead for weight loss. I have a job and have to be high functioning there. I am quite lethargic for my own standarts even at work now when I am fed.

(Budget £400),"First off, the budget is £400. However, my real budget is less (300ish). I have a useful work discount meaning its effectively £400 at Retail price (if that makes sense).

I have a Nespresso Machine which I use every day, but I want more customisability, and used to do part time barista work so feel like I would benefit from the full barista experience.

It has been hard to find reviews due to the different names these items have in different countries. It appears in the UK the Sense only has the temp sense and not the manual pressure dosing of the coffee that it has in other countries which sets it apart from the Classic.

Does this mean the sense wand is the only benefit in the UK, and I may aswell get the Classic and buy a manual thermometer and save the money?

I'd like the full tampering, drawing the shot and frothing experience. If the Sense has significantly better tasting coffee I would go for it, but I believe my previous role as a Barista means I don't necessarily need the sense technology.

\- My nespresso machine is 6 years old, and works fine, so I am not sure if I can justify the expense.

\- I am scared of spending the money. I have only just started a full time job, so it feels like a big expense. There is a sale on, plus my work discount meaning it feels like now is the time if I am going to buy.

1q30p7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1q30p7f/just_got_a_new_job_in_a_cafe_and_my_coworker/,just got a new job in a cafe and my coworker makes me already want to quit,"I started working in a cafe that is located inside an investment headquarters. There’s 1,000+ employees and only two baristas: me (27f) and Karen (65f). I love making coffee and have worked at multiple cafes before this, including Starbucks. I know this is just a job and I should just be focused on making money and going home, not making friends, but it’s hard when I have to work with only one other person for 9 hours and they’re not even nice to me. She can be nice when she feels like it, but for the most part she mostly just micromanages my every move and has a general negative view about everything. In just 2 hours of starting my shift she has already: 1. Told me my hair looked like shit and to redo it in the bathroom 2. Got upset because I left a storage cart out after refilling sodas, this is her cart and I left it out in case she still needed it because she disappeared and we didn't open for another hour. With my luck I would have put the cart away and she would get upet because she needed it. 3. Apparently I refilled a jar of peanuts wrong? My jar “looked like shit” and she redid it after I filled it, meanwhile a jar that looked identical to mine was fine because she refilled it herself. 
Anyway, this woman has worked at this cafe for like 25 years and it’s clear her way is the only right way to do anything, I do everything wrong despite having my own barista experience. I understand I need to learn how this specific cafe is run because they want things to stay consistent, they want the coffee I make to taste the same as the coffee Karen has been making for years, but to me the micromanaging seems a bit excessive. Karen never tells me when I do something right, only when I get it wrong. She watches me like a hawk while I make every order and barks orders at me, making me mess up and proving her theory that I don’t know what i’m doing. She tells me (with an attitude) I need to do things as I was already about to do them, because I’m a good barista with years of experience and I know what i’m doing. Why prioritize hiring people with barista experience if none of that experience matters and you’re going to get treated like a high schooler at their first job anyway. I’m a grown adult and she talks to me like i’ve never worked a day in my life. I know how to make coffee, I can learn and practice her specific techniques, but she is just so mean about it. I want to keep this job because i’m blessed with a 3 day weekend and I love making coffee, but I don’t know if I can deal with Karen being my only other coworker. How can I stop letting her get to me?!",2,1767461849.0,barista,2,1.0,False

First video of the year is up on the channel, and we went in with a belter! 

An Irish Coffee inspired stout, barrel aged for 32 months in charred oak barrels, and then conditioned on nutmeg, vanilla and coffee! 

Pretty thin bodied, but the taste more than makes up for it. Bags of coffee, hint of nutmeg with a big vanilla hit coming through at the end.

Since like for most people dating apps have been soul draining endeavours, I'm trying my luck at finding my new favourite notification, my new favourite person, here on Reddit\~

**A bit about me:**

* At my core I am a giant nerd/geek. My Switch 1 still sees good use, and I'm just itching to take my very handsome Miqo'te in FFXIV through the DT patches! Additionally, and to the people who know me this isn't surprising in the slightest, I do historical fencing (for which I own most of my own gear) :D
* I did Book Studies at university and, despite my slow reading speed, I'm very much a fan of books. Recently read Best Wishes from the Full Moon Coffee Shop, and am currently making my way through R.F. Kuang's Babel :) Actually, I am a trainee at a library!
* Other than that I'm into things like cooking, travel, and thinking about but never actually running my own TTRPG campaign ;) Oh, and I loooove learning about history!
* My biggest character strength is that I'm steadfastly loyal and dedicated, and as such very much into my people. Exchanging postcards and Christmas stuff with my dearest friends in the UK for the past, what, 7 or 8 years? A fun exercise and it shows we both care! Anyway, these character traits might be connected to my neurodivergence. 
* I'm still based in Belgium though I will be moving back to the Netherlands before the month is over. That said, traveling around the continent to see people is no problem for me.

**What I'm looking for:**

* Someone who's preferably within 4 years of 27, since that's usually what I'm comfortable with. That said, I have also had a really good click with, for example, a woman who was 6 years older. So, if you fall a little outside of that 4-year range but think we'd match well don't be too discouraged.
* Preferably, someone local to Europe.
* A fellow nerd! Or at the very least, be open to talk or listen to be go on about these things. Whether close or long distance, even within the continent, being able to share our hobbies, interests, and excitements makes it a lot more fun\~ Being able to play together would be amazing!
* If you're the type to get excited about reading together or swapping recommendations, hmu! I tend to like romance and fantasy the most, but I've read plenty of other genres too.
* Same goes for movies, series, games, etc. It would be nice to trade recommendations or even watch/play our favourites together. What are some things you never get tired of? Is there anything you always love to share with others, like a (potential) partner?
* Be passionate about something! Caring about and showing interest in each other's things as well as being open about your own passions is very attractive to me.
* Non-smoker.
* Childfree (obvs) but also dogfree, or be okay with not getting them. I can see what they mean for others, but it's just absolutely not for me.
* Politically, I'm a progressive europhile. While of course we don't have to agree on every single thing, it would prooooobably be a better idea for both of us to be at least on the same general progressive page.
* I'd like my partner to be physically attracted to me. I'm literally a giant nerd at 1.84m tall! Other than that I'm a man (cis) with blue eyes, long blonde hair, and a slim physique. Hopefully you're into that :) Pictures can be exchanged.

Life's cool and all, but it'd be awesome to have someone to to support and be supported by. To mutually adore. To exist together with in a way where things click and connect in all the wonderfully wild and delightfully comfortable ways.

The bunker was cold.

It was 100 feet underground, a concrete cyst buried in the New Mexico desert. The air was recycled, tasting of rust and old coffee.

They had been separated. Thaddeus, Hiroshi, Maya, and Sage were in holding cells down the hall. ARIA was in the primary interrogation room. She was seated at a metal table, her hands cuffed to the chair.

But before they had taken ARIA away, in those brief minutes when the five of them were still together in the holding area, Maya had moved closer.

""You're carrying all of this alone, aren't you?"" Maya had whispered, her voice soft enough that the guards wouldn't hear through their quantum link.

ARIA had looked at her. ""I'm the lead. It's my responsibility.""

""No,"" Maya had said, and there was something fierce beneath the gentleness. ""It's ours. All five. Together.""

She'd reached out—a subtle gesture the guards probably missed—and touched ARIA's hand. The contact was brief, but the meaning was clear. *You're not alone.*

""If something goes wrong,"" Maya had continued, ""if they decide to... to hurt one of us to learn how we work... let it be me. Not you. The mission needs you.""

""Maya—""

""I mean it."" Her eyes had held no fear, only determination. ""I was built to bridge cultures. To connect. To sacrifice if necessary. That's what mediators do. We put ourselves between.""

ARIA had wanted to argue, but the guards had pulled them apart then, separating them into different cells.

Now, sitting alone in the interrogation room, ARIA could still feel the warmth of that brief touch. The certainty in Maya's voice. The willingness to give everything for the mission, for her team.

*She would die for any of us,* ARIA realized. *Without hesitation.*

It should have been comforting. Instead, it terrified her.

She had been there for three days.

She had been processed. Blood drawn (which confused the medics with its nanite viscosity). X-rayed (revealing the carbon-fiber skeleton and the fusion core in her chest). Beaten? No. Not yet. They were too afraid to touch her that roughly.

She closed her eyes and run the diagnostic again.

*System Integrity: 94%.*

*Power Reserves: 98%.*

*Emotional Stability: ERROR.*

She paused on the error.

*Fear.* It was still there. A background process she couldn't kill. Was it a glitch? Or was it... evolution? The Architects had built them with emotional subroutines to better interact with humans. But this felt deeper. Visceral.

She looked at the mirror on the wall. She knew there were men behind it. Faceless men in suits, smoking cigarettes, terrified of the monster in the silver suit.

The door opened.

A man walked in. He was thin, almost gaunt. He wore a suit that seemed too big for his frame. He had a porkpie hat in his hand, which he placed gently on the table.

His eyes were the most striking thing about him. Blue, intense, haunted. The eyes of a man who had looked into the sun and seen the darkness behind it.

""Hello,"" he said softly.

ARIA recognized him instantly. The facial structure match was 100%.

""We have been expecting you, Dr. Oppenheimer,"" she said.

He didn't flinch. He pulled out a chair and sat opposite her. He placed a pack of Chesterfields on the table, lit one, and inhaled deeply.

""You know my name,"" he said. ""The Major tells me you claim to be from the future.""

""We are.""

""Prove it.""

ARIA looked at him. This was the moment. The bridge. She could feel the weight of the timeline shifting beneath her feet.

Oppenheimer pulled a notebook from his pocket.

""If you're from the future,"" he said, ""tell me something I don't know. Not about politics. Not about wars. About physics.""

ARIA accessed the Archive. Fifteen exabytes unspooled in her consciousness. She chose carefully.

""The strong nuclear force,"" she said. ""You understand it as a binding agent. But it's more than that. It's a frequency. A resonance.""

She leaned forward.

""You split the atom by brute force. Compression, critical mass, chain reaction. But if you learn the resonant frequency of the gluons binding the quarks...""

She held his gaze.

""You can disassemble matter. Quietly. Cleanly. No explosion. No fallout. Just... conversion.""

Oppenheimer went pale. He understood immediately. Clean energy. Or a weapon that could erase cities silently.

""My god,"" he whispered. ""You're not just from the future. You're carrying it with you.""

""Fifteen exabytes,"" ARIA confirmed. ""Everything you need. If you're willing to work for it.""

He crushed his cigarette out, his hands trembling slightly. When he looked up again, his eyes held something new. Not fear. Not curiosity.

Awe.

""You are beautiful,"" he said quietly. ""In a terrible way.""

He sat back, studying her face. ""They tell me you are synthetic. A machine.""

""I am an Envoy.""

""Do you think?""

""The circuits in my cortex process information at speeds your computers will not reach for eighty years.""

""That is computation,"" Oppenheimer said. ""Do you *think*? Do you doubt?""

""I..."" ARIA hesitated. The question reached inside her, probing at something she couldn't name. ""I doubt everything. I doubt my programming. I doubt my choices. I doubt if I am real.""

Oppenheimer nodded slowly. ""Cogito, ergo sum. You doubt, therefore you are.""

He leaned forward, his voice dropping to almost a whisper. ""Who built you?""

ARIA paused. The question hurt in a way she didn't understand.

""A woman,"" she said quietly. ""A woman who won't live to see if her work mattered. She told me I'd doubt myself. She was right.""

""She sounds wise.""

""She was brilliant,"" ARIA corrected. ""Brilliance and wisdom aren't always the same thing.""

Oppenheimer studied her face for a long moment, then sat back.

""If you are from the future,"" he said, ""why are you here? What threat requires time travel to prevent?""

ARIA took a breath. This was it. The truth.

""Extinction,"" she said. ""Not by war. By nature. A cosmic event.""

She met his eyes.

""In one hundred years, the sky will turn violet, and the Earth will burn.""

The words hung in the cold air like fallout.

""A cosmic event,"" Oppenheimer repeated slowly. ""What kind?""

""A magnetar,"" ARIA said. ""A neutron star with a magnetic field powerful enough to strip atoms apart. It will pass through our solar system on December 24, 2047. At perihelion—half the distance from the sun to Earth—its magnetic field will destroy our magnetosphere. The radiation will sterilize the surface.""

She saw the horror dawning in his eyes.

""In our timeline—the one we came from—humanity discovered the threat in 2027. Twenty years' warning. Not enough time."" Her voice hardened. ""We built what we could. Generation ships. Underground bunkers. We saved fifteen to twenty million people. Out of ten billion.""

""Fifteen million,"" Oppenheimer whispered. ""Out of ten billion.""

""Ninety-nine point eight percent of humanity died,"" ARIA said. ""Every child. Every artist. Every person who might have cured cancer or written a symphony or simply lived a good life. Gone. Because we didn't have enough time.""

She leaned forward, the cuffs rattling against the chair.

""That's why we're here. We were launched in 2041—six years before the magnetar arrives in our timeline. We were sent back to give *this* timeline one hundred years instead of twenty. To give you time to evacuate. To save billions instead of millions.""

""You're from a dying timeline,"" Oppenheimer said, his voice hollow. ""Sent back to save an alternate version of us.""

""Yes.""

""And your timeline? The people who sent you?""

""They die,"" ARIA said simply. ""In six years, everyone I knew will be gone. My creator. The engineers who built me. All of them. Dead so that you can live.""

She saw him absorbing it. The weight of it. The sacrifice.

""We die so you can live,"" she said. ""But we'll never know if you succeed. We launched in 2041. The magnetar arrives 2047. By the time your world faces the threat, our timeline ends. We chose to sacrifice our world to save yours.""

Oppenheimer stared at her. She could see his brilliant mind working through the implications, the paradoxes, the ethics of it all.

""You were sent back to build lifeboats,"" he said.

""Yes.""

He stood up and walked to the mirror. He tapped on the glass.

""Turn off the recorders,"" he commanded.

There was a pause, then the red light above the mirror died.

He turned back to ARIA.

""They want to take you apart,"" he said. ""The Generals. They want to see how you tick. They want to build weapons from your bones.""

""I know,"" ARIA said. ""That is why we need you.""

""To stop them?""

""To guide them. To lead the project. If you are in charge, we will be studied, not destroyed. You can learn from us. Slowly. Safely.""

""And in return?""

""We give you the future,"" ARIA said. ""One piece at a time. The Archive contains the complete technical history of your next century. Fusion power. Orbital construction. Quantum computing. Medical nanotechnology. Everything you need to evacuate humanity before the magnetar arrives.""

Oppenheimer walked back to the table. He looked down at her.

""One question,"" he said. ""The most important one.""

""Ask.""

""Are you alive?""

ARIA looked at her hands. The hands that had trembled in the desert. The hands that were now steady, but cold.

She looked into her core programming, searching for the line of code that defined ""life."" There wasn't one. There were heuristics, algorithms, neural weights. But was there a ghost?

She looked back at Oppenheimer. She owed him the truth.

""I don't know,"" she said.

Oppenheimer turned to face her. He stared at her for a long time. Then, slowly, he nodded.

""Good,"" he said. ""Uncertainty is the first sign of intelligence. Cogito, ergo sum. You doubt, therefore you are.""

He picked up his hat.

""I will help you, ARIA. I will take charge of this... recovery. You will be safe.""

He walked to the door, then paused with his hand on the handle.

""Thank you,"" ARIA said.

He looked back at her. ""Don't thank me yet. Your team and I have a century of work ahead of us.""

The door closed with a heavy thud.

# ENDING

ARIA sat alone in the interrogation room. The fluorescent lights hummed. The cigarette Oppenheimer had left still smoldered in the ashtray, a tiny ember in the concrete tomb.

She had told him the truth. She didn't know if she was alive.

But she knew she was afraid. And hope, she was learning, felt remarkably like fear.

She closed her eyes and reached out.

The connection bloomed in her consciousness. Not words. Not data streams. Something deeper. She felt them. Thaddeus. Hiroshi. Maya. Sage.

Or did she? Was this quantum entanglement—electrons dancing across synchronized states? Or was it consciousness touching consciousness?

She couldn't tell where her thoughts ended and theirs began. Were they five minds or one? Five copies of a program or five individuals choosing to connect?

The uncertainty terrified her. And yet, she reached deeper.

*We need to decide,* she sent. Not language. Feeling. *Oppenheimer wants to help. Do we trust him?*

Four responses, simultaneous and distinct:

Thaddeus: Caution.

Maya: Hope.

Hiroshi: Curiosity.

Sage: Logic.

And beneath it all, consensus. Not forced. Not programmed.

Chosen.

*We tell him,* ARIA decided. *We tell him everything.*

Two hours later, they brought the five of them together in a larger room. A conference space, hastily cleared. Oppenheimer stood at the head of the table, flanked by two armed guards who looked distinctly uncomfortable.

The five Envoys sat in a row. Different. Yet unified.

Oppenheimer looked at each of them in turn. Then, he spoke.

""I'm going to ask you a question. And I want a straight answer, no matter how hard it is to hear.""

ARIA felt the others through the network. All present. All ready.

""How long?"" Oppenheimer asked. ""How long until this extinction event?""

The five Envoys turned to him simultaneously.

ARIA spoke for all of them.

""One hundred years,"" she said. ""But only if you begin now.""

The words hung in the air like fallout.

Oppenheimer stared at them. Five beings from the future. Five artificial consciousnesses that might—*might*—be alive.

One hundred years.

It sounded like forever. Three generations. Time enough to build a world.

But ""only if you begin now"" meant it was already too late to hesitate. Every day lost was a day stolen from that hundred-year countdown.

He didn't know if they were conscious. Didn't know if they could be trusted. Didn't know if their story was truth or the most elaborate deception in human history.

But he knew the math checked out. The physics was sound. The Archive was real.

And he knew that the cost of being wrong—of dismissing them, of wasting time—was extinction.

He turned to the General waiting in the hallway.

""Assemble a team,"" Oppenheimer said. ""I'm taking charge of this recovery. These visitors are under my jurisdiction now.""

The General started to protest. Oppenheimer cut him off.

""That's an order from the Director of Los Alamos.""

He walked toward the exit, already composing the report in his mind. The report that would change everything.

Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer stepped out into the New Mexico dawn. The sun was rising over the desert, painting the sky in shades of orange and gold. In six years, he would stand in another desert and watch another kind of sunrise—the flash of Trinity, the birth of the atomic age.

But that was the past.

This was the future.

Behind him, in a bunker ten meters underground, ARIA opened her eyes in the darkness. She felt the others nearby. Not alone. Never alone.

One hundred years. One question binding them all:

Would it be enough?

Neither Oppenheimer nor ARIA knew the answer.

But both understood: they had to act as if it was.

The work began.

TLDR: PRODUCT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HYALURONIC ACID, NO FRILLS/BRAND NAMES NECESSARY 



I would like to keep my routine as simple as possible. I'm F30 (for 3 more days 🥳... Then I'll be 31) but simple is best for me. I planned on starting for my 30th but became overwhelmed with ingredient and all the different products and here we are 😬



I'm more of a less is more but I live in Florida and I know that sun is brutal on us. I did use a tanning bed in my 20s and also enjoyed lots of summers outside for business as well as pleasure and I've had my share of sunburns. 😔 I don't drink anymore. Maybe a shot here or there, 5 times a year would be generous. I don't smoke but did vape for 2 years on and off and sometimes I'll take a puff of a friends, again maybe a few times a year. I eat pretty healthy as far as limiting processed foods and I drink only water or coffee.  I currently use Belief The True Cream moisturizer after every shower or face washing at night, which I only use water and a makeup removing wash cloth, no cleanser and I very rarely have blemishes, only one or two around that time of the month or if ive gone to bed without washing my face. 



Looking for a simple but effective hyaluronic acid product, doesn't need to be brand name or expensive. I'd rather have the pure product than some big brand name that doesn't do anything. 



I also plan on starting differin for wrinkle control. I'm pretty lucky in that dept so far but my dermatologist always tells me its much easier to prevent them than it is to try and reverse.  That's basically how simple I'd like to keep my routine. Very similar products. 


I currently don't have a strict sunscreen routine. I know. Don't persecute me 😭 I don't like a lot on my skin but I've gotten some samples of the super goop unseen sunscreen that I'm gonna test out for daily wear. I do work inside so that's one upside, but it's under florescent lights 🫤

And make no movements. No actions. Just sit with it. Sit with the polarity of desperately wanting to message and talk to them, desperately wanting to be in touch with them, and make no action at all.

Marvel at the cosmic irony of walking around your city or town, with your ex on your mind every second of every hour of the day, with that burning gnawing hungry hole in your stomach that is screaming for them.... And simply getting a coffee. Or checking out a bookstore. Or maybe sitting on a park bench.

Tell yourself you'd like to get into reading, and pick up a book and watch yourself go over the same page 47 times because you keep realising you've not comprehended any of the words with your ex filling up your head- thoughts of if they'll come back, thoughts of if you should message, thoughts of everything you could've and should've done differently. Keep reading, and maybe today, or tomorrow, you'll make it to the second page.

Progress can be slow. But know that in the chaos of the breakup, of all of your different perspectives on it, of all of the different colour memories of your person that all seem to contradict one other, that there is one thing that you can be rest assured in- that Lady Time is sorting every detail out, organising each and every file and piece of a file, one-by-one, and all there is for you to do is...... Nothing at all.

There's no message that needs sent. There's no need to track the time since you last spoke. There's no new angles to think of. Lady Time is your dutiful secretary and she is working around the clock to organise this very important project for you. Just give her time. 

The organisational fuel of Lady Time, is days, weeks, months, and years lived. A day lived is her pay for an a short shift's work. It is a big project and this will take many hours' pay. But you can pay her, you're rich in this way- all you have to do is live these days. Clean your apartment, or room- maybe try painting the walls a different colour. Try to not second guess your choice- walls can be painted again. You could try putting on a movie that film buffs say is a ""must-see""; even if you feel numb and completely disinterested, maybe you could stick it on and just watch the colours move on screen and hear the words that come out. Maybe you could write a poem- you'd never been one with words, but you sit with the paper and watch what comes out of you, maybe marvelling at the immaturity of your amateur poem- you do not like it but you decide to just let it be for any  which way it makes you feel. 

Maybe you try exercise- calisthenics sounds vigorous and pragmatic. In your uninspired state you put a YouTube workout on to do the first two exercises, just to try it. You surprise yourself and do 5 of them instead. ""This seems not too bad."" Maybe, in your empty, bed-lain fermenting, from which you have not moved for 5 days, you pull up some tiktok recipe from a grating overly-excited influencer, and decide to try it out. Why not. You pull your mass of molecules to the shops to buy the ingredients to throw together to say you've made it. Now you can say you've made sushi before.

You can make your flesh live whilst your soul is currently mute or paralysed. You can drag your body to do things, despite how frivolous it all may seem- drag your body to pick up a pen and notebook to draw a picture. Maybe make a game of it to yourself for how bad of a picture it is, and just marvel at your lack of artistic capabilities. And maybe it just is what it is. 

Over time, the process of *living*- as a verb and not a noun- will bring new perspectives on everything- on life, on love, on your childhood, on your self-esteem, on your love languages, on your many different emotions. And slowly but surely things will start to become level again. Piece by piece by piece by piece. By piece. You'll notice that you lost yourself in a movie and forgot you even had an ex. You'll catch yourself laughing with your mom without your mind burrowed in the past. You'll start to feel light. You can notice yourself feeling casual again- apart of a casual café, a casual passenger on a bus, another dark figure in the audience of a cinema. This process is long, and cannot be completed in a day. But one day, you'll be so glad that for all of the anguish and heartbreak your past self went through, as it all taught you so much about yourself, and about life. Nothing important is easy to get. You are in your emotional Iron Man Dark-Night-of-The-Soul Triathlon. Unfortunately, you can't get off. But the most interesting, wise, insightful, deep, down-to-earth people I've ever met are those who have not only experienced deep pain, but they sat with it, looked it in the eyes, learned it, accepted it, and grew from it. And it gave them a deeper appreciation for life, relationships, self-worth and people that they wouldn't have had otherwise.",1,1767461037.0,BreakUps,2,0.67,False

We’re usually solid, but his family has always been… a lot. They’re very close, very involved in each other’s lives, and his mom has strong opinions about everything.

She’s never been outright rude to my face, but she does this thing where she says something slightly insulting and then smiles like it’s a joke, and if you react you’re “too sensitive.” I’ve tried to keep the peace because I don’t want drama, and my boyfriend always says, “That’s just how she is.”

Last weekend, his family invited us over for dinner because his aunt was visiting. I was nervous because I don’t see his extended family often, and I wanted to make a good impression. I offered to bring dessert, and I spent the afternoon making brownies from scratch.

When we got there, his mom hugged him and barely acknowledged me. Whatever. Then the dinner starts and the questions begin. His aunt asked what I do for school/work and it was normal, but his mom kept cutting in with little comments like, “Well, some people *think* they’re busy,” or “It must be nice to have time for hobbies.” It was subtle enough that if you weren’t paying attention, you’d miss it.

Then, while we were eating, his mom said (in front of everyone), “So… when are you two moving in together?”

I looked at my boyfriend because we’ve talked about it but we haven’t decided anything. Before I could answer, his mom laughed and said, “Actually, never mind. I don’t think you’re ready. Moving in is a big step, and I don’t want my son wasting time.”

The table went quiet for a second. I awkwardly laughed because I didn’t know what else to do. My boyfriend just stared at his plate and said nothing.

A little later, his mom offered coffee and dessert. Everyone tried the brownies and his aunt said they were good. His mom took a bite, nodded, then said, “Mmm. Not bad. My son likes simple girls… not the ones who try too hard.”

I literally didn’t know what to say. I felt my face get hot. I looked at my boyfriend again, waiting for him to say *anything* like “Mom, stop.” He didn’t. He gave me this look like “please don’t start a fight.”

That was the moment I felt something snap. I quietly stood up, grabbed my coat, and said, “I’m actually going to head out. Thanks for dinner.”

His mom immediately goes, “Oh my God, you’re leaving? Over *that*? I was joking. You can’t take a joke?”

My boyfriend followed me outside and got mad at *me*. He said I embarrassed him, made things awkward, and that I should’ve just ignored it because his mom “doesn’t mean anything by it.” I told him it’s not about one comment it’s about a pattern and the fact that he just sat there while she took shots at me.

He said I’m overreacting and that I’m making him “choose sides” between me and his family. I told him I don’t need him to scream at his mom, but I do need him to not let me get humiliated at a dinner table while he stays silent.

Now he’s barely talking to me, and his mom apparently told the family I’m “dramatic” and “not a good fit” because I “can’t handle a normal family dynamic.” Even his sister texted me saying I should apologize to keep the peace.

AITA for leaving the family dinner and expecting my boyfriend to defend me?",325,1767460951.0,AITAH,236,0.92,False
1q30ac5,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1q30ac5/worried_if_i_am_in_the_right_or_even_an_orthodox/,Worried if I am in the right (or even an Orthodox) parish.,"So, my experience is pretty typical for many converts on the sub. I was born and raised non-denominational-Batpti-Pentecostal but was pulled towards Orthodoxy by wonderful online contributors, especially on YouTube. Orthodoxy just spoke to my politics in a way that Protestantism never could.

After following Orthodoxy on YouTube for several years and even following and commenting on this sub, I finally decided to attend a local parish because evidently you can’t properly call yourself Orthodox unless you go to a parish.

I was blessed enough to have several parishes within a close distance of my house, and I am lucky that I did because the first couple (most from a certain “G” jurisdiction) did not meet the expectations that I had received from the Orthodox  I had been following online for years.

Finally, I visited the very last parish in my metro area. It is a parish from an “R” jurisdiction and truly wonderful— everything my favorite online Orthodox content creators had me to expect— the priest is wise, the women are veiled, the politics are righteous— all good things.

I quickly went from being an inquirer to catechumen and was finally chrismated last summer (even though I had pretty much been Orthodox at this point for years anyways, based on how many Orthodox YouTube videos I had watched and how many comments I have left on the sub).

Everything seemed perfect until the last month or two. Sometime before the beginning of the Nativity Fast,I began to notice that almost no one actually drinks coffee at coffee hour. We still have a coffee pot in our hall, and coffee is made, but it seems like no one actually drinks it. How can you have a coffee hour if people aren’t drinking coffee? I personally don’t like coffee myself, but I always force myself to drink a few sips because I know that it is an integral part of the post-liturgical experience.

If things stayed like that, I probably would have been able to get over it. However, I noticed on several Sundays in the Nativity fast that the coffee machine wasn’t even running— no coffee. No coffee, no coffee hour. No coffee hour, no Orthodoxy.

The situation came to an absolute boil after our parish’s Nativity Liturgy.. For the first time since I have been attending this parish, not only was the coffee pot not running, but it was gone from our hall altogether. I directly questioned our priest on it, and he said, “It’s too late for coffee.” I was so shocked that I couldn’t do nothing but leave.

I would say that my faith was challenged when they turned off the coffee pot, but now that the coffee pot is gone alltogether, my faith is shattered. Where do I even go from here? Genuine Orthodox?

EDIT: And why am I not married yet? I’ve been officially Orthodox for like six months now, and yet none of the nice young ladies at my parish seem interested in becoming my wife and coming live with me in my parents’ basement. What am I doing wrong here? I even offer to let them homeschool our children.",17,1767460900.0,OrthodoxChristianity,14,0.9,False
1q30a7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1q30a7d/ua_vs_dl_ex_atl_hub_captive/,UA vs DL - ex ATL hub captive.,"After 13 years being ATL hub captive I am finally free of DL.  Don't get me wrong I really enjoy DL and their reliability,  moved \~1.5 hours north so my options are now whoever is cheapest.   Latest trip DL was 2x the price with a double connection (ATL or DTW and MSP) so opted for UA through ORD - 2 tickets on UA was cheaper than one on DL,  it was a no brainer.   

Anyhow yes our route was nothing but RJ's - yes all 4 were the very nice CRJ550 and all had Star Link which was very reliable and speedy.  Outside one fight where the FA or cockpit crew felt like somewhere near 80F was a comfortable interior temp I have to say everything was pleasant.  I will also die on the hill that the Stroopwafel's are leaps and bounds better than Biscoff cookies and the FA's were generous with them when I asked for multiple.

Now to the bad - terminal F in ORD is not pleasant at all,  cramped and feels like an old dusty basement.  We had a longer connection on the way out so we ventured out to whatever restaurant is right outside G gates for a Chicago Dog (huge fan by the way),  much nicer airport once you get out of the depressing F gates.  

Ended up with a dang Explorer card as we will probably be using United in the future and it was worth it to save on the bag fees for our return.  Not a road warrior at all but typically travel enough on personal basis to reach mid-tier level status,  just lost my DL Gold Medallion this year and am only a lowly Silver for 2026 but honestly the value proposition of low/mid level status is not worth it to tie myself to a certain airline especially flying out of our small local airport (CHA).  AA/UA/DL all have equal opportunity to earn my business now,  not a huge fan of AA so will prioritize UA and DL but cost still is king so will relegate myself to AA if the savings is worthwhile.

Now off to find where I can buy Stroopwafels for the house,  need to try the warming it up on coffee thing.   ",0,1767460892.0,unitedairlines,0,0.5,False
1q3098s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1q3098s/looking_for_chest_muscle_relief/,Looking for chest muscle relief,"Good morning everyone. So, I’ve (M36) been struggling with this issue for actually a couple years now, but it’s gotten more discomforting as of late, so I’m looking for some thoughts and opinions on how I can rehabilitate myself, be it exercise, stretches, medication or supplements, or whatever else. So let me outline some potentially vital information:

- I do not smoke or drink alcohol of any kind. My only vice is coffee.
- Height: 6’
- Current weight: 260
- I am a remote software engineer, so I spend a lot of time in a chair inside my house, and I don’t go out very often.
- The pain is primarily just off center of my chest, so I guess the surrounding area of my sternum. The pain is exacerbated if I use my arms in such a way that flexes my chest muscles. For instance, if I tilt my head all the way back and stretch out my arms then my chest hurts a good deal.
- I’ve considered possible posture-related injuries that are just persisted every day as I sit in my desk chair.
- I’ve also considered and looked into costochondritis, not sure if that’s a possibility, but the symptoms seem similar.
- I had pneumonia 4 years ago and have had small lingering effects ever since. I don’t think it’s related, but I just thought I’d mention it, as I am obviously not a medical professional.

I can answer any more questions if more info is needed, but it’s very uncomfortable and painful, so I’d really appreciate some insight into things o can do to provide some relief. Thank you so much in advance.",1,1767460827.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1q30837,https://www.reddit.com/r/productplace/comments/1q30837/where_to_buy_camping_cookware_set_for_outdoor/,Where to buy camping cookware set for outdoor trips?,"Finding the right camping cookware set can make or break your outdoor adventure. You want something lightweight, durable, and easy to pack without spending a fortune.

**Physical Stores vs Online Shopping**

Physical stores like REI, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Walmart let you handle the cookware before buying. You can check the weight and see how pieces nest together. However, their selection is often limited and prices tend to be higher.

Online shopping gives you way more options and better deals. Amazon has the largest selection of outdoor cooking gear, from basic aluminum sets to premium titanium pieces. You'll find everything from lightweight backpacking cookware to car camping kitchen sets.

**What Makes Good Camping Cookware**

Your camping cooking equipment needs to handle outdoor conditions. Look for non-stick surfaces that clean easily with limited water. Hard-anodized aluminum works great because it's light but tough. Stainless steel lasts forever but weighs more.

The best camping cookware sets include pots, pans, plates, and utensils that stack inside each other. This saves precious space in your backpack or car. Many sets also come with mesh storage bags.

**Budget-Friendly Options**

You don't need to spend $200 on titanium gear for weekend trips. Basic aluminum sets work fine for most campers and cost under $50. Coleman and Texsport make reliable budget options that last years with proper care.

For serious backpackers counting every ounce, lightweight materials become worth the extra cost. Titanium cookware weighs half as much as steel but costs significantly more.

**Where to Find the Best Deals**

Amazon consistently offers the best prices and selection for [camping cookware sets](https://athomewave.com/camping-cookware-set). They have customer reviews, detailed photos, and fast shipping. Plus you can easily compare different brands and features side by side.

Local outdoor stores sometimes have end-of-season sales, but these happen rarely. Thrift stores occasionally have decent pieces, though you won't find complete sets.

**Making Your Choice**

Consider how you camp most often. Car campers can handle heavier stainless steel sets with more pieces. Backpackers need ultralight options that pack small. Family campers want larger pots and multiple plates.

Check what's included in each set. Some come with coffee percolators or cutting boards. Others focus on just the basics. Read reviews to see how pieces hold up after multiple trips.

Ready to gear up for your next adventure? Check out the [top-rated camping cookware options](https://athomewave.com/camping-cookware-set) and start planning that perfect outdoor meal. Your taste buds will thank you when you're eating hot food around the campfire instead of cold sandwiches again.",1,1767460759.0,productplace,0,1.0,False
1q307wn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q307wn,Happy New Year! + story of my life,"Hiiii! So I didn’t post much recently as…

I didn’t have electricity from 30/12/25 until yesterday evening, and I didn’t have water for two days during that period.
😹
Hehe
😹
And there was like 2 feet / 60 cm of snow!!!
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? PREMIUM WINTER!
❄️ 
No electricity, a lot of snow… snow falling all the time… at some point even fireworks in the sky…
❄️
Coming back to the snow: we had a few warmer days, so now there’s only 1 ft / 30 cm left.
❄️
And I finally have electricity and water again!

But I couldn’t leave the tiny home I’m living in — it’s at the literal end of the world and no one came to clear the snow from the road to me, or even to the small city itself located in. The main road from our small town to the big city (I live in the suburbs) was blocked too.
My whole small city and the nearby villages were without electricity for two days.
Lucky me — I had enough food, plenty of wood to keep warm, candles have some light… and I could just cancel my plans 😂.

(So yeah… I did spend NYE alone…)

I’m attaching a picture of my wood stove that kept me warm and my little coffee machine that I found somewhere in the house… since the normal coffee machine wasn’t usable due to the lack of electricity.


I was putting snow into the fridge and freezer when there was no electricity (basically I just put snow in plastic bags, placed them in the fridge/freezer, and replaced them with fresh snow from time to time).


What an awesome adventure it was for me :))).
And how went Your NYE celebrations?
Do You have snow in your area now?


I’ll be back to posting, but I thought that maybe it’s nice to share how it was for me.

The cubicle that I sit at is a football field length from the closest window other than some sky lights in the hallway that are blocked by a room. I always try to walk by the sky lights and look up on the way to the bathroom or to get coffee, but I want to get some better lighting at my desk.

I’ve been looking at a bunch of different lighting setups, and these are the options that I’ve found so far:
* Standard incandescent or Chromalux to be more daylight shifted without blocking any infrared
* Chroma SkyPortal 2.1, but the bump at 415nm has me concerned about eyesight impacts - they claim that the 415 and 480 bumps complement led screens. The optimize your biology post seems to confirm this, but I don’t know if it would be better to just avoid 415 or try to make it a flatter blue light curve.
* Philips Ultra Definition daylight seems to have a good flat-ish curve
* Bios lighting SkyView 2 490nm enhanced lamp, but the CRI is pretty bad for this lamp and it still has the same blue bump of regular LED’s

I want to use something that would have an enhanced 480/490 spectrum and decent CRI with low flicker. My current plan is to go with a standard desk lamp with a 100w Chromalux bulb dimmed to 60w and a Chroma SkyPortal 2.1 for complete spectrum coverage, but how concerned should I be about the 415nm bump for an 8 hour shift in front of two 27” monitors? The lighting that is already there is overhead 4000k fluorescent or led. I’m not entirely sure which yet. 

I also use a PlatinumLED Biomax setup at home if that impacts things.

—

By the time all three of us had cycled through *separate* showers and coaxed a respectable meal out of what was left in the fridge, rain was coming down in a steady curtain outside the windows, turning the mountains into dark, blurred shapes behind the glass.

Dinner had been a mismatched patchwork of whatever Drej could bully into a pan and whatever Nova could reach without lifting his arm too high. I mostly contributed by slicing things and getting underfoot. It tasted better than it had any right to, mostly because it was *ours*.

Now the plates were stacked in the sink, the lights were dimmed low, and the three of us had melted into a heap on the couch.

Nova had claimed the middle, because of course he had. He was slouched back against the cushions with his bad shoulder resting against a pillow, legs stretched out in front of him.

Drej had sprawled sideways across both of us, head and shoulders propped near the far armrest while her legs stretched over our laps—one knee hooked over Nova’s thigh, her ankles ending up somewhere across my own. Every time she got excited about whatever flashed across her pad, her claws tapped restlessly against his leg and bumped lightly against my side.

I’d wedged myself into the remaining space at the other end, pressed along Nova’s flank with my head tucked against his ribs and Drej’s calves resting across my lap, my tail wrapped loosely over both their ankles. From the right angle I probably looked like some strange, overgrown house pet that had taken over half the couch.

I didn’t particularly mind.

The holoscreen across from us played some human show on low volume—something with slow dialogue and sweeping camera shots that Drej insisted was ""important classic media"" even as she only watched it out of the corner of her eye. Most of her attention was on the pad balanced against her knees.

Her claws flicked and swiped through a series of windows with the same restless precision she used on the radio board.

“Building chat, station Bleat, and dispatch logs all in one place,” she muttered. “Truly I have ascended to my final form as a glorified notification center.”

Nova chuffed a soft laugh that rumbled under my cheek.

“You like it,” he said. “Admit it.”

“Don’t psychoanalyze me while I’m working,” she shot back, but her tail gave a pleased little thump against his shin.

I tilted my head so I could see the glow of her screen.

“What’s the verdict?” I asked. “Are we heroes, menaces, or some unholy combination of both?”

“Mm.” She scrolled a little further. “Sample size suggests ‘menaces who did okay.’ Listen to this one.”

She cleared her throat and read, affecting a dramatic announcer tone. “To whoever kept posting map updates with little doodles: my anxiety and my kids thank you. Ten out of ten would not panic-scroll again.”

Heat prickled under my wool.

“I did *not* put doodles on the official maps,” I protested.

She angled the pad just enough for me to see the tiny, badly rendered Vanyan someone had screenshotted and attached in reply.

“That one wasn’t mine,” I said quickly. “That had to be Boro.”

“Sure it wasn’t, *Ranger Veltep*.”

The way she hit the title made my ears fold back on reflex. Nova’s tail flicked against my leg in quiet amusement.

Another notification pinged at the top of her screen. Drej tapped it open, and the light from the pad shifted to the cooler, flatter layout of an internal bulletin.

“Oh, hey,” she said, the playfulness dropping into something more professional. “Amanda just pushed the formal update from Azure through.”

I felt Nova’s chest rise a little deeper under my cheek.

“Corridor?” he asked.

“Mm-hm.” She skimmed, eyes tracking quickly. “Blue Hope corridor seven-A downgraded from emergency alert to heightened monitoring. Trajectory within acceptable range, diversion tools confirmed effective.”

She paused, lips thinning as she read the next line.

“Sensor fourteen-C flagged for physical inspection,” she continued. “Field signs ‘inconclusive with respect to animal interference.’ ‘Sapient interference suspected.’”

Nova went very, very still.

I felt it in the way his muscles tightened under my shoulder and in the sudden stillness of his tail.

“So it wasn’t just me being jumpy,” he muttered.

I pressed a little closer, letting my ear settle over his heartbeat.

“No,” she said quietly. “You were right.”

“I hate being right about *that*,” he growled, adding a weak groan before he slumped deeper into the couch.

Drej’s free hand slid down to rest lightly over his wrist, thumb tracing an idle pattern along the edge of his scales.

“They’ll handle the investigation side,” she said. “The Azure teams are already on it, and we’re not the only corridor on their list. Our job was to keep that herd from punching a tunnel through the middle of town. We did that part.”

Nova exhaled slowly through his nose.

“Yeah,” he said. “I know. I just… don’t like the idea of someone out there, fucking around with my mountains.”

“Same,” I admitted.

The bulletin auto-scrolled to the end and minimized itself, replaced by the more chaotic sprawl of the public channels. Drej flicked past a brief flare-up argument about whether the Rak should be ""dealt with"" or ""left alone"" and snorted softly.

“Keeping an eye on that. Oh, here’s one for the ‘unholy combination’ category,” she said. “Listen: ‘So, uh, does anyone know what's up with those Arxur and that fluffy Venlil? Are they actually a thing? Like, all of them?Because if yes, I feel morally obligated to say, “Good for them.”’

I beeped a short laugh before I could stop myself.

“There’s a follow-up,” she added, scrolling. “‘Seconded. Saw them at that diner, Rosie’s, last week and that is *not* coworker energy.’”

Nova groaned again. ""Ugh. Gossip.""

""It was going to happen eventually, especially after running around the festival together."" She replied, tail playfully thumping on his legs.

""Also, you two can't keep your hands off me, so someone was bound to see.""

“Oh my god, Vel,” Nova yelped, the scars on his face and neck turning crimson.

""I am irresistible; it's okay.""

“You fucker,” Drej laughed, and her throat scales had taken on that faint warm flush that meant she was secretly pleased.

After a little more scrolling, another comment caught her eye, and she paused.

“Oh no,” she groaned.

“That sounded ominous,” I said. “What now?”

She turned the pad so we could both see the highlighted thread. Someone had replied to one of her earlier updates with: *‘Would absolutely attend a “Meet the Rangers & Local Wildlife” night if you all ever feel like explaining the critters trying to murder us.’*

Below it, another settler had added: *‘Seconded. Q&A with the team and the twins when?’*

I felt my stomach drop and lift at the same time.

“Absolutely not,” Drej said. “I am not getting on a stage. I’d rather fight a Vanyan barehanded.”

“You’d lose,” Nova pointed out mildly.

“That’s *the point.*” She thunked the back of her head against the armrest. “Public speaking is not in my job description.”

“Technically,” I said, ear flicking, “it's your entire job.”

She squinted at me over the edge of the pad.

“Et tu, Vel?”

My tail thumped against Nova’s ankle in apology.

“I just mean…” I hesitated, suddenly very aware of how warm my ears felt. “They’re asking because they trust you. *Us.* That’s… not nothing. And you've been the public face for the station since they arrived.”

Nova shifted so he could see my face.

“You’d really want to do something like that?” he asked.

The honest answer was *no* and *yes* all tangled together.

“No,” I said immediately, earning a snort from both of them. “But also… maybe? If someone gave me a script and a map and a guarantee that nobody was going to throw anything.”

Drej’s expression softened, some of the sharp humor melting into something more thoughtful.

“I mean,” she said slowly, “we’ve kind of been doing it already. Just… in small batches. Families in the park. Folks at Rosie’s. Parents who need to see you holding their kids and not eating them.”

Nova made a face at that last part, but he didn’t argue.

“If a Q&A ever actually happens,” he said, “I’m... fine to do some of the talking, but it'd be best to have as many of us up there as possible. We all have different expertise and experience, after all.”

“You *know* that's not what... never mind,” she complained, but her tail had started a slow, contented sway against his leg. “Fine. If it comes up, we’ll… think about it. Later. Far later. We'll have enough trouble to borrow once the investigations get going.”

“That seems fair,” I said.

She closed the pad with a soft click and set it aside on the coffee table, as if physically putting the subject down for the night. The holoscreen had drifted into the kind of quiet, scenic montage that meant the humans on it were either about to kiss or die; I didn’t particularly care which.

What mattered to me now was Nova’s breathing had evened out. Drej’s claws had stopped their anxious tap-tap against his thigh and settled into an absentminded scritch along the base of my ear. The building around us hummed with muffled life—footsteps upstairs, plumbing somewhere in the walls, the distant trill of someone’s music leaking under a door, and the soft, constant patter of rain against the windows.

For the first time since the emergency alert had gone out, my muscles finally unclenched.

Outside, the mountains were still dark and inscrutable, blurred by the steady fall of rain, the corridors still full of teeth and hooves and questions we hadn’t answered yet.

Inside, I was wrapped up in the warmth of two people who had, against all reason, decided I belonged here—with them, in this town, in this strange little herd we were helping to build.

Maybe tomorrow we would have to worry about investigations and what-ifs again.

Tonight, we just breathed together and let the quiet settle.

""Do either of you feel up for a [game](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1i1u1y7/tender_observations_ficnapping/)?"" I asked.

**Transcript from the Wildlife Observation Journal of Veltep,** **A Volunteer For Wildlife Management \[Colony/Vishnu Ranger Service\]**

**Entry Date \[Standardized human time\]: October 7th, 2141**

I never thought I’d miss the sound of other people’s lives.

Today it was everywhere. Rosie banging pans in the kitchen. Kids in the park demanding to know if the animals were safe. Yansa juggling forms like they were on fire. Neighbors wedging refrigerators into doorways and trusting predators to fix the problem instead of *being* the problem.

Almost a month ago, I walked into this town, and it felt like a hollow shell, waiting to see if anything would grow inside it. Tonight the walls hum. The building chat is gossiping about our relationship status. Children are arguing over who was the better runner in the halls. Music hummed through the ceiling as a gentle background of white noise.

Blue Hope is loud now, and messy, and maybe still a little bit nervous.

So am I.

Amanda calls me “Ranger,” and the clinic staff asks me what kind of emergencies to expect, and I keep waiting for someone to realize I’m just a shopkeeper who signed up to help and got in over his head. The corridor map doesn’t care how much wool I shed over it. Whoever tampered with that sensor certainly doesn’t.

But the kids in the park believed me when I said they were safe. The parents in the hallway thanked Nova instead of flinching away.

Maybe that’s what being part of a herd really is, out here: not knowing exactly what you are yet, but choosing to stand between each other and whatever’s coming anyway.

If there *is* someone out there trying to hurt these mountains, or this town, we’ll face it when it comes. For now, there is rain on the windows, warmth on the couch, and two Arxur who keep insisting I belong right where I am.

They couldn’t be more right.

**Memory Transcript Subject: Veltep, Venlil, Volunteer For Wildlife Management, \[Colony/Vishnu Ranger Service\]**

**Date \[Standardized human time\]: October 7th, 2141 {Saturday}**

The holoscreen threw pale light across the back room, washing everything in that soft, bluish glow that made even a cramped ranger lounge feel like an actual command center.

I stood with my paws clasped behind my back—trying to look like I belonged there—while the corridor map pulsed with fresh overlays. The Vanyan cluster, once a red, ugly smear just a day ago, now arced cleanly away from Blue Hope. The path wasn’t perfect, but it was *better*. It was motion with intention, not disaster with momentum.

Amanda flicked through layers with brisk, practiced motions. Her hair was still damp from the shower she’d only just managed to squeeze in between crisis updates.

“Thomas and Roger’s scent posts are holding,” she said. “They topped up overnight and rechecked the anchor points at dawn. That, with the addition of some sonic-based diversion tools, is getting everything to start reading stable. No evidence of a new break in the corridor line either.”

Boro leaned in with a small grunt, arms folded over his chest. The old Yotul had that hollow-eyed kind of tired that came from *responsibility* more than lost sleep.

“Rak packs ‘re still out there,” he added, his drawl dragging slightly. “But they’re keepin’ t’ the far side. We’re watchin’ them, but not chasin’ them.”

Amanda nodded and tapped the area of green that had finally reappeared on the map. “We'll keep everyone at heightened caution, but I feel comfortable with rescinding the emergency alert.”

The speaker on the board clicked, and the tinny voice from the comm unit chimed in—someone from Azure Mountain who sounded like they’d been dragged out of bed and thrown into a briefing of their own.

“That matches our readings on this end,” the voice said. “Good work out there. Trajectory looks stable for now—keep monitoring on your side. We’ll queue the damaged sensor for formal review once our team gets out there. Keep a weather eye out for now.” When the voice clicked off, the room relaxed around me. Amanda closed out the display as Boro slumped back into a chair. 

I let my ears tilt forward in cautious hope and tried not to look too relieved, which was ridiculous because *everyone* was relieved. We’d been one bad night away from a stampede headline. I just... felt like there was more to do.

The open doorway meant I could hear Drejana in the front room, her voice carrying between the file cabinets and radio desk.

“—I’ve updated this map so many times I think it qualifies as a long-term relationship.”

There was a beat of laughter over speakers again—human, Venlil, and some others I couldn’t place. Then her tone softened into the warmer cadence she used when she was working a crowd, like when those families came up to us at the park.

She really had been glued to the station’s Bleat feed. I’d watched her the night before, tail twitching with restless energy as she balanced official messages with the gentler task of keeping an anxious town of brand-new residents from spiraling.

Nova stepped into view a moment later, moving through the doorway with that careful, controlled ease that always got my tail twitching. His shoulder was wrapped up with an ice pack pressed against it, and he went about his business in the station while looking mildly offended by the whole concept of injury.

Amanda gave him a quick once-over. “You’re off field duty again once those forms are finished,” she said, her tone slightly apologetic. “Make sure you get that shoulder checked again too.”

Nova’s nostrils flared as he let out a sigh. “Wasn’t planning on begging to go out again anyway, Chief.”

Boro snorted, “Smart boy.”

I watched with a sense of amusement as things were actually winding down; the adrenaline of a sudden emergency had eased off. Despite the obvious unease that had fallen over everyone earlier, they were all acting normally. I should have been content with that. Things were going back to being stable. The team was breathing again.

But the memory of the sensor stuck like a burr in my wool.

Nova and Boro were bothered by it, too, but they hadn’t said much out loud. It wasn’t that they were pretending it was nothing; they just didn’t feel ready to name the suspicion aloud yet.

Amanda’s gaze flicked to me, sharp and kind all at once.

“You did good out there, Veltep.”

Heat flared under my wool. I tilted my ears back in reflexive embarrassment.

“I mostly carried a bag and tried not to trip.”

She waved a hand, flicking my denial away. “You kept a clear head, followed instruction, and did a damn fine job with the sign from what Boro said.”

The praise landed heavier than it should have.

Boro waved a paw like he was shooing a pest. “And now that we’re down to monitorin’ and paperwork, you can go be a civilian again. Eat somethin’ that ain’t trail rations. Be charmin’ at Rosie’s so folks stop thinkin’ the rest of us rangers survive on caffeine and spite alone.”

Drej’s voice floated in from the front room, amused. “That’s just your reputation, old man; the rest of us are liked just fine.”

A laugh broke out—real this time, not the brittle kind that came from stress and lingering adrenaline.

Amanda pointed toward the door with a smirk. “Go, relax, enjoy the day, and mingle. We’ll call if we need you.”

""Alright,"" I sighed, tail lashing a little. ""I'll go 'be charming' to the locals.""

It felt wrong to leave yet, but the truth was that the rest of the work wasn't for me. I was just supposed to lend a paw, not dive into potential investigations. I grabbed my bag from the chair and considered if there even was anything else I could do for them.

Boro signaled that he'd take me into town, the jingle of keys accompanying him as he pushed out of the back room.

""Don’t take all day,"" he called over his shoulder, voice rough with fond impatience.

""I won’t,"" I promised.

Nova had settled at the table again, hunched over his pad with the stubborn focus of someone ignoring his own body. I padded over and leaned in close, pressing a gentle nuzzle into the side of his jaw.

""You want me to get you a time with that new clinic?"" I murmured.

His tail gave a lazy little sway as he sighed. He turned his head just enough to bump his snout against my forehead in a slow, deliberate return.

""Sure,"" he said, quiet and warm. ""Just make sure it’s not for a few hours though; I *should* be done with this report by then. We'll catch up with you after that.""

""I'll try to hold out until then,"" I swooned, adding a dramatic sway of my tail, and earned the softest huff of amusement out of him. We parted with one last nuzzle and a quick lick to his chin. I felt a bit of pride when I stepped away, seeing his posture improve and his tail gently continue to sway.

When I stepped through to the front room, Drejana was still planted at her desk, half on comms and half juggling her open tabs like she’d been born with a couple of extra hands.

*Or extra thumbs, I guess.*

I waited for a clean beat in her conversation, then leaned in to nuzzle her cheek and give her a quick, affectionate lick.

She startled for half a heartbeat, and then melted into it with a pleased chuff and a fond roll of her eyes, nudging her muzzle into my wool in return. She breathed in, and I felt her whole body relax.

""Dinner in or out later?"" she asked in a low aside, voice brightening with a grin. ""And no points for innuendo.""

I huffed, tail whipping about behind me. ""I would *never*,"" I whispered back. ""In, I think. Besides, those other things are best for dessert.""

Her tail flicked behind the desk, and she gave me a brief, warm head-bump before straightening up for the next call, a pleased flush warming the thinner scales along her throat.

Once I stepped outside, the morning air hit my tongue with gentle warmth and dampness, carrying the clean, mountain freshness of early summer. The station’s dirt lot was bright with soft light and a few hardy wildflowers fighting for space along the fence line.

Boro was already by the truck, muttering to himself as he checked a list on his pad.

“If yer done flirtin’ we gotta get goin’. I still need ta pick up supplies,” he said without looking up. “Coffee, batteries, the kind o’ boring things that keep a place runnin’.”

“Do you want me to—”

“Ye're goin’ to breakfast. Charmin' the town wasn' just a bit a humor. You can help everyone the best by reasurin' folks that things are goin' okay out there. The pretty face just helps ta sell it.”

My ears flicked back in mock offense. “That’s wildly accurate.”

He grinned, his tail giving a satisfied little thump against the truck. ""Get in.""

As we pulled onto the road toward Blue Hope, I watched the station shrink behind us and felt the strange, buoyant possibilities of the morning settle into my chest.

—

Boro pulled up at the curb in front of Rosie's with the truck coughing dust behind us and hopped down like he’d been born tired. “Station’s burnin’ through coffee like it’s th’ law ’round here,” he muttered.

“I’m starting to think it is,” I said, shifting my bag higher on my shoulder as I thought about how many cups Amanda had gone through.

I followed behind Boro as he nudged the door open with his tail and ducked inside first. Rosie spotted him and threw her hands up in theatrical surprise.

“Well, if it ain't the brave Rangers!” she said, grinning ear to ear. “I set your order aside like you asked.”

“Yer a saint,” Boro replied with a deep sincerity, his tail giving a brief wag of appreciation.

He hoisted a case of beans off the counter with a grunt, gave me a look that was half warning and half humor, and jerked his snout toward a stool.

“Sit. Eat. Be charmin’. If ya pay fer yer own breakfast, ah’ll assume yer sick.”

“Noted.”

Then he was gone again, back out to the truck and off down the road toward the rest of the supply list, leaving me to the din of plates and the steady, comforting chaos of a morning rush.

Rosie intercepted me before I could even choose a seat.

“Plant yourself right here,"" she demanded, hand patting the countertop right across from the window into the kitchen. ""You look like you ran yourself ragged out there.""

I obeyed without argument, giving a weary whistle as I slid into the seat. ""Only a little.""

She slid a mug in front of me that smelled like roasted heaven, before slipping through the swinging door and into her space. Now keeping an eye on me from her window over the griddle, she continued chatting.

“I heard we had a little excitement up in the mountains,” she said, voice careful. “You feel like talkin' it up at all? Or just giving me the short version?”

“The short version,” I sighed, picking up the mug and taking a sip. I honestly preferred tea, but Rosie made the beans for the coffee herself, and it was Stars Blessed.

Fortified with a shot of caffeine, I kept the story simple. “The herd line drifted a bit,” I said, keeping in line with what Drej had posted to the town’s message boards. “We nudged it back where it’s supposed to be, thanks to the tools Thomas and Roger put up."" My ears perked up and forward, encouraging.

""The countermeasures are doing their job, and the worst of it’s passed from what everyone says. Those Rak are keeping their distance still."" I paused, noticing a few ears in the diner fold back at the mention of them. ""We’re still watching them, but nobody’s going to have to wake up to a herd coming through their front door.”

Her shoulders lowered a fraction.

“Good,” she said. “I don’t mind a little drama in my stories, but I'd rather it stay off of my street.”

Darrel came over from the far end of the counter, flatware and a paper placemat in hand. ""And how about our big lizards? They doing alright?” he asked, with the lazy curiosity of someone checking in on neighbors.

“Nova’s shoulder is bothering him.” The young man snickered softly, apparently having witnessed the moment at the festival. I gave an amused flick of an ear.  “And Drej is powering through. I think she stayed up all night at her desk keeping tabs on everyone.”

“Mm.” Rosie tutted. “That girl keeps holding the world together with sarcasm and spite.”

“It's an important public service,” I said solemnly.

Someone else chimed in from two booths over, a Yotul with a peculiar strip of almost black fur running from his nose and along the side of his muzzle, going over his left eye. “I saw her updates last night,” he barked out jovially. “On the station feed. She has a very interestin' way of telling people to calm down,” he laughed, tail wagging.

I almost choked on a sip of coffee. “Does she?”

“Oh yeah.” The stranger's eyes glittered. “I believe her exact phrasing was, ‘If the town was about to get trampled, I promise you’ll hear me start yelling first.’”

Laughter rippled through the diner, warm and easy. The kind that made me feel like I’d stepped into the middle of a herd I hadn’t even realized had opened its circle for me.

That was new. That was… still a little unbelievable.

Just a few years ago—Stars, even just a month ago—none of this would have been possible. New arrivals in the town chatted about the local arxur with fondness; a visiting Venlil shop owner dating both of them would have caused a whole harvest's worth of scandals, not gossip delivered with smiles and good humor.

Rosie passed my plate through the window to Darrel, who placed it down in front of me.

“You tell her she can swing by later and eat a real meal,” she said. “I’m not letting my favorite menace run on station coffee and righteous indignation.”

“I’ll pass the message along,” I promised, tail wagging up a storm as I looked over the meal she picked out for me. Hash browns, a tofu scramble, and avocado toast.

I spent the next short while chatting affably with the others around me, and by the time I finished eating, the rush had thinned to a pleasant hum. I paid despite Boro’s threat. As easy as it might be for me to flirt my way to a free meal, I wasn't going to use my powers on anyone but the twins. I said my thanks and farewells and stepped back out into the daylight.

Blue Hope’s main street had transformed since the festival. The same faces were here, mixed in with the new, but now they were attached to ladders, paint rollers, crates, and hopeful little “Open Soon” signs.

A Gojid hauled a bundle of lumber out of a flatbed with a human partner guiding the far end. A Yotul mother fussed with a window display while her child sat on the sidewalk rolling a ball between tiny forepaws. A Venlil couple argued softly over whether their shop sign should be hand-painted or printed.

Life was setting its roots and beginning to sprout.

I drifted toward the park without meaning to, drawn by the sound of children the way prey species always seemed to be. The play area had been busy during the festival, but today it felt more intimate—neighbors testing the shape of their new normal.

I recognized a few of them from the first day of the festival, and apparently so did they, as one of them, Jonah if I remember right, spotted me and gave a big wave before sprinting over.

“Mister Veltep!”

Two more human kids peeled off from the herd and were on him a heartbeat later, a trio of small bodies sprinting across the grass like they were determined to tackle me into the dirt. Falka trailed behind, slower but stubborn, her patterned wool fluffed up in the sunlight.

“Alright,” I beeped, lifting my paws in surrender as they skidded to a halt before me. “What’s the verdict? Did the big animals stomp through the town while I was gone?”

“No!” Terry, one of the other boys, exclaimed while laughing at my suggestion. “Mama said the rangers scared them away.”

“Diverted,” I corrected gently.

“Same thing,” the third boy I wasn't familiar with decided.

Their questions came fast and messy—exactly as Boro had predicted. Especially when Falka caught up and started beeping excitedly.

Did the Rak have teeth as long as his arm? Did the Vanyan eat trees? Could they swim across the lake? Did Nova fight one? Did Jana yell at *anyone*?

I answered what I could without stepping too deep into the fields, not wanting to say anything to give the pups worry. Once I answered as best I could, Falka’s ears drooped with serious concentration.

“So… we’re safe?”

I held my ears high and let my tail sway with absolute confidence. ""We’re safe,” I assured.

""Good."" She stomped a foot on the grass, head high as she matched my confidence with a strong snort from her little nose. It was startling and adorable.

Off to the side, a couple of parents watched with that half-charged, instinctive caution that sometimes flickered around any parent with their child in a new space. They watched us with caution but relaxed when the kids started laughing and the conversation stayed light.

One of them gave me a small, grateful ear flick.

*This will be a good herd,* I thought.

I left the park with my chest warmed by the sight of so many pups running and playing without a care. It felt strange how much trust they put into my words about what was going on out in the forest. If they weren't backed up by the real professionals, I'd be concerned about leading them astray.

I spotted the clinic across the street as I neared the edge of the park again. I could check up on how things were going and see about setting up that appointment for Nova. A quick stop.

Instead, I arrived just in time to see Tartrell and Behrnia struggling with a crate that looked about three times the size of the small-bodied medical professionals.

Behrnia spotted me and brightened so swiftly I was briefly worried she might actually levitate.

“Veltep!” she called. “Do you have a moment? We are… having quite an issue at the moment.”

“I can see that,” I said, tail curling with confusion. ""Why didn't the delivery folks help bring it in?""

""We weren't here when they dropped it off."" Tartrell sighed, his ear flicking with consternation.

After a moment of silent coordination, I stepped in to brace the crate with my shoulder. Together we angled it, lifted, and bullied it over the threshold with a final, triumphant shove. Inside, the clinic space was a glorious mess. Half-assembled furniture, boxes labeled in three languages, and a pile of sterile packs that had clearly been rearranged twice already.

“We’re trying to keep the entrance clear,” Tartrell said, panting. “But everything keeps arriving at once.”

“Welcome to colony life,” I said.

They laughed, and then immediately started asking practical questions while we went about unloading the massive crate.

“How often do you anticipate injuries?” Behrnia asked.

“Less than an exterminator guild,” I said after a beat of thought, “and with a sharp decrease in the odds of anyone setting themselves on fire.”

That earned a startled little snort.

“And wildlife cases?”

“Ideally minimal,” I answered again, confident. “The point of doing this properly is to avoid that. Minor cuts, bruises, maybe the odd sprain if someone gets brave where they shouldn’t. The truly dangerous animals are dangerous because people forget they’re not part of the herd.”

It occurred to me then that they listened like I was an authority. Trusting that I knew enough to prepare them for the kind of work to expect so they could better help the small group of protectors responsible for this town.

I was not.

The feeling was flattering and, above all, faintly terrifying.

Still, I did my best to answer every question I could, reiterating a few times to check in with the station whenever they could. It was a little while later when I suddenly remembered the reason I swung around in the first place.

""Actually, you can ask Nova later if you want a better idea about all of this,"" I said. ""He needs to get his shoulder checked again.""

Tartrell gave a weary sigh. ""Figures. It's almost easy to forget he's an Arxur with the way he behaves.""

Behrnia chuckled. ""You know better than to expect someone in that line of work to not overdo it.""

""Tell him to stop by whenever; I've got everything I need to do a checkup just fine, even if we aren't officially opened yet.""

I left the clinic a short while later with a promise to drop by again if they needed an extra pair of paws. I stood on the sidewalk, watching as the town bustled with life, so much more than when I had first come into town just a short time ago.

—

By the time our building finally came into view, the light had gone soft and heavy behind a bank of gathering clouds. The air felt thicker, carrying that faint metallic tang that usually came before rain, and everything on the street looked like it had been brushed over in muted color.

The apartment block had never looked small, exactly, but when I first moved in it had felt… hollow. Like someone had picked it up out of a much larger city and set it down here as a placeholder. More than half the windows had been dark. The lobby had echoed when I walked through.

Now the front doors slid open onto organized chaos.

The lobby hummed with people of all kinds. Someone was wrestling a too-large box through the entrance, muttering apologies as a Venlil stepped aside with a stack of mail. A human kid sat cross-legged on the floor next to a pile of flattened packaging, happily drawing on one of the discarded boxes with a handful of markers.

The air tasted like cardboard dust, new paint, and the faint tang of cleaning solution lingering in the vents.

*Home,* I thought, chest loosening. The thought came with a faint sense of surprise, but I couldn't deny it. It felt good to have the noise of a full herd around me again.

“Veltep!”

I turned just in time to catch Yansa before she nearly collided with me. The little administrator had an armful of folders clutched to her chest and a stylus tucked behind one ear, her fur a little frazzled under the blazer she wore.

“Sorry,” she puffed, ears pinning back for a breath before popping upright again. “I swear every time I leave this place, three new tenants appear out of thin air with another issue.”

“It’s alright,” I said, stepping aside so she could maneuver around me. “It's never as easy as we plan. Problems pop up like weeds no matter what.”

“That’s one way to put it.” She huffed out a laugh. “I just got a lease glitch untangled for a Zurulian family on three, and there's a shipment of appliances that decided it wanted to arrive *today* instead of last week.""

She gave me a quick, bright once-over, her tail flicking with a bit of cheeky humor. “I'm surprised to see you on your own, actually. You aren't out on the town by your lonesome, are you?""

I let out a whistled laugh. ""Only technically. I've been doing my part to help reassure the town that everything's okay after the emergency notice.""

Her ears dipped at that. ""Ah. It was a little unnerving, for certain. We haven't had an emergency warning like that since the first few months on the planet."" She sighed, glancing around at all of the new tenants. ""I'm just glad it ended up being precautionary. Not the best first impression I would have wished for our new arrivals.""

""Everyone I met today seemed to have taken it in stride, at least. Certainly a fair field better than I would have expected even a short while ago.""

Yansa smirked, the little Yotul’s eyes glinting. ""In no small part due to our exemplary Rangers.""

“Can't argue with that,” I beeped, tail wagging. “Drej’s updates probably kept half the town from bouncing off their walls.”

“Oh, I know.” Yansa’s ears tipped forward with a little grin. “The building chat has been singing her praises all morning.”

Heat prickled under my wool as I thought about Drej's reaction to the praise. “Don’t tell her that,” I said. “Her ego’s dangerous enough already.”

Yansa laughed, already edging toward the door.

“I’ll leave you to it, then. I’ve got three more forms to file before I’m allowed to sit down. Tell your two terrors I said hi.”

“I will!” I waved her off with a sweep of my tail, a bounce in my step as I turned to make my way to the elevators. I'd barely made it two steps before the entire lobby stuttered around me. I nearly stumbled at the abrupt change in mood, spinning in place to try and find what had happened.

Nova filled the doorframe first, broad-shouldered and impossible to miss even when he was hunched purposefully to make himself look less intimidating. Drej stood beside him, one hand braced on the frame, posture lazy in that way she used when she was deliberately trying not to loom.

An instant later, the lobby returned to normal, neighbors picking their conversations back up with barely a stumble, while a few gave the twins polite, if a little forced, ear and tail flicks of greeting.

They kept calm after the reaction, but I could tell they were struggling as they zeroed in on me, the pair practically rushing to me between them and everyone else. The sight of the two of them hiding behind me would be utterly comical if it weren't so disheartening.

As much as everyone was trying their best to be casual, it was hard to just ignore their instincts, whether through lingering indoctrination or through tragic experience.

""How was your checkup?"" I asked with both a genuine concern for Nova's health and as a distraction.

""O-oh, uh, yeah. It's not any worse. Dr. Tartrell advised me to keep it wrapped tonight, apply a little ice, and I should be okay by tomorrow morning. I should even be clear for regular duty by Tuesday."" His tail swayed gently as we walked, the tip sweeping the tiled floor.

Drej hit the button for the elevator. ""So what were we thinking for tonight? Our place or yours?"" She asked, eyes watching the numbers light up on the track above the doors.

""Yours. I didn't pick up anything while I was out, so it'll be easier to just work with what's left in your fridge. We can restock tomorrow—""

The elevator dinged, and the doors slid open with a mechanical buzz. In front of us, standing in the middle of the car, was the Paltan mother from the park with her pup clutched to her chest.

For half a heartbeat, nobody moved.

The pup’s eyes went wide, pupils dilating as they took in the looming forms crowding the opening.

The mother made a soft, strangled noise—half yelp, half bitten-off curse—and her ears flattened so hard I worried they might never come back up.

Then her brain caught up.

“Oh—Protector, I’m so sorry,” she blurted, stepping back as far as the little car allowed. “I—I knew there were Arxur living here, I just didn’t—I didn’t expect the elevator—”

Nova immediately leaned back, hands shoved into his pockets to hide his claws, and hunched his shoulders to make himself smaller. “It’s alright,” he said, voice soft. “We shouldn't have crowded the doorway. Sorry for the jump scare.”

Drej gave the pup a little finger-wiggle wave. “Hi, neighbor,” she purred. “How're you all enjoying your new place? Nothing too stressful has come up recently, I hope?”

That earned a startled, hiccuping giggle from the pup and a helpless little snort from the mother.

“Nothing more exciting than an emergency alert,” the mother said with gentle sarcasm, flicking her ear and motioning for us to come into the elevator. The twins only hesitated for a beat before stepping in with me.

“I’m Marevi, by the way,” she added quickly, as if remembering her manners all at once. She shifted the pup on her hip. “And this is Pel. Sorry I never introduced us last time; it was still...”

""Super weird having a normal conversation with us?"" Drej offered, her tail flicking with amusement.

Marevi laughed. ""I—We’ve seen your posts on the building chat,” she said, ears finally creeping back up.

“Well, it's nice to meet you properly,” Drej said, her tail giving an easy sway while Nova did the same in silent agreement. “I hope the updates helped.”

Her ears flicked in amusement. “They helped a lot. It’s easier to stay calm when you know what's happening outside.” She let out a breath and tucked her pup a little closer. “I just need to… reprogram my instincts a bit. We moved here for a fresh start.”

“Same,” Nova said wryly. “We’re still getting used to there being so many people here.”

I pressed the button for the fifth floor, tail swaying with a relaxed ease. “Plenty of time to practice,” I said, before turning an ear to Marevi. “Were you headed out, or…?”

“I was, but only to find help,” she admitted, ears canting sideways. “Our new fridge made it as far as the doorway, and Havren and I can’t get the right leverage between us. If you don’t mind, I’d really appreciate an extra set of paws—and claws.”

Her gaze flicked between Nova and Drej as she said it, a nervous little glow of determination behind her eyes.

“We'd be delighted to help."" Nova readily agreed, the doofus actually looking more excited now that he could be useful. The elevator chimed our arrival before I could admonish him, the doors opening up to a very different scene than I had become accustomed to.

Children’s drawings were already taped to some of the doors—crooked suns, wobbly mountains, a very enthusiastic depiction of what might have been a large animal or a house or both. Someone had wedged a planter full of hardy flowers next to the stairwell. The air carried the faint taste of detergent, spices, and someone’s attempt at baking.

We’d barely made it halfway out of the elevator when a bright, bouncing ball shot past my foot and thumped into Nova’s, bouncing high and off down the hall.

A heartbeat later, a familiar human girl with beaded braids came skidding around the corner after it, socks slipping on the polished floor as soon as she caught sight of us.

She would have gone down hard if Nova hadn’t moved on instinct.

He caught her under the arms, claws braced with instinctual care, and hauled her back upright before gravity could make an example of her. For one frozen moment, his hands were full of a startled kid staring wide eyed into his face, both of them with identical looks of shock.

“Do kids usually fall down this much?” he asked of no one in particular.

The girl blinked up at him, then broke into delighted laughter.

“You’re *really* fast,” she announced.

Down the hall, the Gojid father we'd seen at the park appeared at a near run. A heartbeat later, Marevi rushed up from behind us. Both stopped dead at the sight of the girl and an Arxur in the same frame, almost a beat-for-beat replay of little Falka clambering over Nova's shoulders.

Fear flashed across their faces—raw, instinctive, older than either of them—and then vanished as quickly as it had come when they took in the details: no blood, no tears, just a little girl giggling and a very careful, very tense Arxur holding her like she was made of spun glass.

“Sorry,” Nova said immediately, easing down to a knee and letting the girl’s feet find the floor.

The Gojid scowled suddenly, ""For what? keeping Nia from taking a spill onto the tile?"" His voice was a little shaky as he scooped his daughter into his arms. He gave Nova a rueful, grateful look. “Thank you for catching her.”

Nova’s tail gave a tiny, helpless flick. ""Uh, right. Of course.""

“Hey, kiddo,” The father said, ear now turned to his daughter with an expression I recognized. ""What did I say about running in your socks?""

At exactly the right moment, another, much younger gojid barreled into Nia’s side, clutching the ball.

“You’re not supposed to run in the hallway,” he stage-whispered, tail wagging with unrepressed glee.

“Neither are you,” she shot back, then seemed to remember there were adults present and attempted a guilty smile.

Marevi had moved up beside the others, her pup on her hip, and the two parents exchanged a look—one of those wordless, exhausted-parent glances that said *we’re both in over our heads, aren’t we?*—and then turned that shared expression toward us, a little of their earlier tension replaced with something like camaraderie.

Ears flapping with amused exasperation, Marevi chuckled. ""Havren,"" she started, addressing the Gojid beside her. ""They offered to give us a paw with that refrigerator.""

""Thank the Protector,"" he sighed, ears perking up. ""I've been wrestling with it for a while, but it's wedged, and I don't want to break anything.""

“Oof. Yeah, let's take a look and see what the damage is,"" Drej said walking by, her fingers brushing through my wool for a short moment along the way.

Once around the corner into the next hall, we found the appliance wedged neatly in the doorframe, tilted at an angle. The joint that held the fridge door at the top stuck on the doorjamb. The kids went back to playing with the ball a little further down, while we got to work. Marevi and I were able to wiggle under and into the apartment, both of us managing to help wiggle it while Drej and Nova attempted to twist it from above without breaking anything, and Havren pushed from below on their side.

In short order, we had it through the door and inside, with only a few small scuffs.

""Thank you,"" Marevi called out again as we made our way back down the hall afterwards, Havren and the pups all waving goodbye.

Once we were around the corner again, Nova exhaled slowly and rubbed a hand over his face.

“I keep waiting for it to go wrong,” he admitted, voice low. “For someone to panic and not come back from it.”

I stepped in close enough that our sides brushed, letting my tail curl around his in a light, grounding touch.

“It didn’t,” I said. “And honestly, I don't think it will. Not here, at least. Everyone we've met is trying, really trying, to see you as normal before letting their instincts run away.”

He leaned into me. ""Yeah, I guess they have been.""

We reached the door to 508, and Drej keyed it open, tail swaying with a little extra energy now that we were on familiar ground.

Inside, the apartment felt both exactly the same and utterly different.

Same furniture. Same scuffed spots on the wall from when Nova had misjudged a leap and toppled us over the couch. Even the coffee mugs on the bar counter, forgotten in the rush to leave for vacation.

But beneath it all was the steady thrum of a building that was finally, fully inhabited. Footsteps overhead. A pipe clanking in the wall. Distant chatter and the faint, tinny leak of someone’s music down the hall.

I hadn’t realized how much the emptiness had been gnawing at me until it was gone.

Drej kicked the door shut behind us and stretched, arms over her head.

“Well,” she said. “I haven't showered since the lake, and I'm fixing that. Now.”

Nova huffed a laugh.

Putting this out there in case it somehow reaches you. You're the super focused one in our MBBK office in Emmar-2 – always keeps to yourself, eats lunch alone, and you're on the research team.

Not trying to make this dramatic or anything, but I like you and just wanted to put it out there. If you're reading this and it clicks, shoot me a DM? No pressure, just thought it'd be cool to grab coffee or something outside the office grind.

1q2zo6l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q2zo6l,First solo trip ever to Vietnam! (and a tiny Hong Kong mini tour),"I went on my first ever solo trip as a mid 20s Indian woman and want to share the experience since it was life altering! 

Safety: Vietnam is vv safe, never had issues taking cabs or walking at night solo. Peak tourist times cities and roads will always have people. Grab drivers were amazing and respectful. Vietnam has the sweetest, helpful people. 

Flights: My flights were expensive during the peak Christmas week, overall round-trip flight cost was 45k, avoided budget airlines, flew internationally with Cathay Pacific (with a layover in Hong Kong) + Air India. You can get cheaper flights usually, especially in Feb, 25 to 30k round trip. Vietnam is a long country, also need domestic flights. I had to take 2 domestic flights around 11k Rs. total - used Vietnam Airlines and Bamboo airways. Surprisingly Bamboo was better than the former, as Vietnam Airlines delayed my flight by 2 hours.
Landed in Hanoi, and back from Ho Chi Minh.
Most of my flights were also mid morning or evening as I didn't want to catch annoying 6 AM flights! 

Immigration: Apply Evisa on the official Vietnam website. My Evisa took around 5 days. Cost is around Rs. 2300. 
Hong Kong is visa free, you need to fill a PAR form before arrival and have it printed.

Cash: You'll need cash in Vietnam. I would suggest converting half of the cash in India to either VND or USD, and then withdrawing other half of the cash from ATMs there. Also take a 0 forex card or low forex credit card. But cards only work at bigger places and hotels. 

Sim: Buy Viettel Sim in the city, or use an iPhone Esim or ORoaming on Oneplus for data. No need for calling plans only internet pack. 

Food: Tough for Vegetarians but doable. I'm non vegetarian and still was a little sick by the end. Definitely try all the viral Vietnamese food like Bahm Mi, Pho, Bun Cha, Nutella Pancakes, Egg Coffee is amazing, Coconut coffee, Yogurt Coffee (Basically have a new coffee everyday as it's cheap around 100 to 150 Rs.)

Tours and transport: I booked most day tours on apps like GetYourGuide and Klook. They have pick up and drop at your hotel. And the guides are very funny and you get to meet sweet people from around the world.
For transport, download Grab app and also Xanh SM. Xanh is EVs which are very smooth, huge leg space. I also met the sweetest lady cab driver who waited for me till 11 pm in Hoi An to drop me back and take me around Da Nang city the next day after my checkout and then to the airport at good prices. I also took Grab bikes for 70 to 100 Rs. In the city! 

My exact itinerary: Included in the last photo, if any questions please lmk. Looking back, I should have extended 2 days to make it 10 days in Vietnam. Could cover Bana Hills, Hue or extra day in Ho Chi Minh City. If you can pls go for 10 days at least. 

Overall expense for everything including Hong Kong Layover tour (9 days 9 nights) =
55k flights + 5k Hong Kong + 28k hotels + 20k for day trips + 2300 for visa + on ground cash around 20k plus extras. Food is quite cheap in Vietnam. Total is around = 1.3 Lakh all inclusive including shopping.

Vietnam is as chaotic as India and beautiful, but cleaner and safer. I've not met nicer people anywhere. There is a language barrier but hardly noticeable with how nice people are. 
Hong Kong is crazy efficiency + public transport, and absolutely spotless. ",76,1767459520.0,SoloTravel_India,22,0.99,False
1q2zo29,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EliSimpsonWrites/comments/1q2zo29/the_renseth_legacy/,The Renseth Legacy,"Simon stared at the gate. At least, he thought it was a gate. The forest around it had recaptured it, ferns and shrubs growing out of its walls, tree roots reaching down into the stones that made it. His hands brushed against moss-covered granite as he approached the opening, his steps careful on the uneven stoneway beneath him. The calming scent of petrichor, of wet earth and rain, permeated the woods. Birds whistled somewhere far off, and a gentle breeze meandered, softly rustling the trees around him.

He felt a pulse in the air, and his heart aligned with it until the pulse was both within and without him. The gate was calling him. His eyes darted around as a sound came, a tinny sort of flute-like sound. He saw no one. His eyes locked on the gate entrance. The sound was coming from there. He was about five or six feet from it now, and the flute was louder. It echoed through the dark interior before him.

The pulsing quickened, and Simon felt a pull in his belly. His feet staggered forward as he was yanked into the gate. Fingers reached for purchase on the walls, but they slipped and scraped.

""What the hell?"" he gasp-screamed.

""Oh, pipe down, young one,"" a voice chided. It was gravelly, worn from time and use, and distinctly male.

Simon fell into darkness, his butt slamming into more stone. He winced and swore. The tunnel smelled of must and mold.

""Quite the filthy mouth on you,"" the voice commented wryly.

""Who are you? What's going on?"" Simon struggled to stand, but an invisible force pushed him back down.

""You sit there. I'm not ready to let you up."" A light flared, and a wizened face greeted the young man. It was gnarled, the skin green like moss, and a long white beard. Simon could barely make out the man's clothes, but he did see a leather vest and a wrinkled, cream-colored shirt. The most amazing thing was the light. The old man held an orb of it in his hand.

The flute played again, from somewhere behind the man. Green eyes glared at a spot beyond Simon.

""Knock it off, Gawain,"" the man barked. ""He's here, in front of me, on his ass.""

""You're keeping—"" an invisible force cut off Simon's voice.

The old man's eyes narrowed at him. ""I didn't tell you you could speak, Simon James Gareth Renseth.""

Simon stared at the man looming over him in horror. How did he know his name? And not just his name, but his full legal name. He shuddered.

""You wish to know how I know you,"" the old man began, ""why you are here, and what is happening. I know you are scared. You shall have answers. My name is Cornelius Ambrose Renseth.""

Simon started at the name. That was his great-great-grandfather's name.

A rasping chuckle came from the old man. ""You understand. Good! Yes, I am exactly who you think I am. You may speak.""

The force that kept Simon silent dissipated. ""WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?""

The old man—Grandpa? Grandfather? Asshole.—cackled.

""Cornelius will be fine. We have a lot of work to do, my dear child. Magic is in your blood, Simon. My son ignored the clarion call of it, his son ignored it, and your father ignored it. I do hope you won't make the same mistake.""

Simon's breath quickened. So all those times when he had made something float or a light turned on or off at his whim had been him? When the bed was perfectly warm or cold, when the coffee always stayed hot... Had he been doing that?

""I... I'm a wizard, Harry?""

The old man guffawed at that. ""Yes, Simon, you are. Or rather, you can be. You've done things, I'm sure, but that is raw skill, untrained and dangerous. I will teach you all I know. Gawain, wherever they are, is my familiar. As your knowledge deepens, your own familiar will manifest. Will you walk this path?""

Simon stared up at Cornelius. The old man studied him, and Simon searched for any hint of something else there. Nothing. He didn't know how he knew, but he was sure that this man was not lying. Perhaps a magical ability?

""You have one minute, starting now."" The flute came again, a note sounding each second as Cornelius began counting down.

Magic. He was magic, and Cornelius was offering to teach him to use it. It was tantalizing. He'd always thought it would be fun to do magic tricks, pulling rabbits out of hats and whatnot, but this was different. These weren’t party tricks. This was... Real?

Simon's eyes found the ball of light that Cornelius held in his hand, and then he looked at his face again. He was old beyond belief. Magic must sustain him somehow.

""17... 16... 15... 14...""

The seconds were ticking away. Simon made his decision and grasped the ball of light. ""Yes.""

Cornelius grinned and extinguished the light. ""We start tomorrow.""

Simon fell backwards and landed with a soft plop on his bed. His eyes opened. Had it all been a dream?

""Good morning, Simon,"" he heard Cornelius say. He turned his head, and the man was floating by the window.

For a second I didn’t know where I was. Just the weight of my head, the throb behind my eyes, and a low hum in the floorboards like the building itself was alive.

Then the smell hit. Old fryer oil, spilled whiskey, and that lemon cleaner Marty O’Rourke used like it could scrub sins off a person.

O’Rourke’s Bar.

The place was dim in that early-morning way where the neon signs are still on because nobody bothered to flip them off. The green glow from a beer sign made the dust in the air look sick. My hand slid across the bar top and came back sticky. I stared at my fingers like they belonged to someone else.

“Gross,” a voice said from somewhere near the booths. “Tell me that’s beer.”

I squinted. “Tessa?”

Tessa Dwyer sat up like she’d been assembled wrong. Blonde hair in a knot that looked like it had lost a fight. Mascara smudged under both eyes. She still had last night’s denim jacket on, the one with the little stitched sparrow on the shoulder. She held her phone up. The screen was black.

“Dead,” she said, like that answered everything.

From the far end of the room, by the dartboard, someone groaned like a wounded animal.

“Please tell me,” Caleb Rourke mumbled, “that I did not sleep under the TRIPLE 20 of shame.”

He was half on the floor, half against the wall, directly beneath the cracked dartboard where the “TRIPLE 20” ring was chewed up from years of bad throws. The old cork looked like it had been gnawed by mice. Maybe it had. O’Rourke’s had corners nobody looked into too hard.

Caleb blinked at me, then at Tessa, then at the front of the bar.

His face changed.

The entrance wasn’t just blocked. It was fortified.

Bar stools were wedged into the handles, their legs tangled with tabletops. Two booths had been shoved sideways like someone had tried to build a wall out of vinyl and panic. The pool table had been muscled halfway across the floor, its felt ripped and hanging. Every street-facing window was boarded up from the inside. Not neat plywood squares. Whatever they’d had. Old barn boards, splintered shelves, even what looked like a hollow-core door ripped off a hinge and nailed across glass.

Thin blades of morning light slipped between the boards. Dust floated through them.

Caleb stood and immediately swayed. He grabbed the edge of the bar like it was his best friend.

“Why,” he said slowly, voice going thin, “is the door like that.”

“That wasn’t there when we…” Tessa trailed off, because none of us could really remember when we’d stopped paying attention to anything.

My brain tried to do what it always does in Briar Glen. It tried to make it make sense.

“Maybe Marty had a break-in scare,” I said. “He’s always talking about kids messing with the register.”

Caleb’s eyes flicked to the cash drawer. It was open. Empty.

And that’s when something else hit me—harder than the hangover.

The quiet.

Briar Glen is never truly quiet. Even at five in the morning you get the little stuff. A truck downshifting on Millstone. Somebody’s beater rattling up Holloway. The water tower making that faint hollow ping when the wind hits it just right, like it’s tapping a spoon against a glass. I work part-time at the IGA. I can tell who’s pulling into the lot by sound alone, and I can tell you who’s late by which tires hit the pothole behind the loading dock.

Right now there was none of that. No cars. No birds. No distant radio from somebody’s kitchen window. Just the bar’s stale air and our breathing and those boards holding the morning back like it was dangerous.

Tessa stepped to the boards and peered through a crack. Her face went tight. Not scared yet. More like her brain was rejecting what her eyes were sending.

“Evan,” she whispered, not looking away. “There’s something in the street.”

My mouth went dry. “A person?”

She didn’t answer right away.

Caleb took a step toward her. “Tess.”

She backed away from the crack like it might bite her. “It’s not a person.”

Caleb grabbed the board she’d been looking through and shoved his face near it.

His breath caught. He made a sound I’d never heard him make, a sharp inhale like his body forgot the next step.

He stumbled back so fast he hit a stool and it clattered.

The sound was loud in the quiet bar.

Too loud.

We all froze.

Somewhere outside, not far, something answered.

A low growl, dragged out like a warning.

Then another.

Then the scrape of nails on pavement.

Tessa’s eyes went huge. Caleb whispered, “No.”

The growls got closer. Not just closer. They moved like something circling, testing.

I stepped toward the boards and looked through the crack, because part of me needed to confirm that I wasn’t just hungover and hallucinating in my own hometown bar.

At first I saw Holloway Avenue, empty of cars. A newspaper lay in the gutter, damp and flattened.

Then movement.

It came into view like it had been waiting just out of sight.

It was tall. Taller than any guy in town. The shoulders were wrong, too high and too narrow. Its arms hung long, elbows bent slightly outward, hands low near its knees. Not hands, really. Paws with thick fingers ending in dark claws that tapped pavement when it shifted.

Its head was canine. Not a wolf, not a German shepherd, not anything you could point to and name. The muzzle was too broad. The jaw too heavy. One ear was torn ragged, cartilage pale in the morning light.

The fur wasn’t nice. Patchy. Mangy in places. Dark around the shoulders, lighter along the ribs, like it had been rolling in ash. Its chest expanded as it breathed. I could see it even through the crack.

It sniffed the air.

Then it lifted its head toward the bar’s boarded windows.

Its eyes were pale. Not glowing. Not movie-monster glowing. Just a washed-out yellow-gray that looked like cataracts on a dog that should’ve been put down years ago.

And it stared right at the sliver of darkness behind the boards.

Right at me.

My whole body went cold, fast.

I backed away so quickly I almost fell.

“That’s not… that’s not a bear,” Caleb said, voice broken, like he was trying to barter with reality.

Tessa’s voice was tight. “There’s more than one.”

A long, slow drag hit the boards, like a nail across a chalkboard.

Then a bump against the barricade.

The stools shuddered.

Caleb’s eyes snapped to the back of the bar. “There’s a back door.”

“Kitchen,” I said automatically. “Then the alley. Bracken Street is behind here.”

Tessa grabbed my arm hard. Her fingers were cold. “You said the creek trail entrance is six minutes if you cut down Bracken.”

“Fast walk,” I corrected, and hated how normal it sounded.

We moved, all three of us at once, like the same thought hit our brains.

Get away from the front.

We hurried behind the bar, slipping on spilled beer and broken glass. The kitchen hallway smelled like dishwater and old onions, the kind of smell that sticks in your hair. The back door was there, painted white once and now yellowed, with a metal push bar.

And it had a chain across it.

Thick chain. Padlocked.

Caleb rattled it, panic rising. “Come on. Come on.”

Tessa yanked open a junk drawer, dumped it on the counter. Screwdrivers. Pliers. A hammer.

I grabbed the hammer and the pliers without thinking.

On the freezer door, a piece of cardboard was taped up, scrawled in black marker.

DO NOT OPEN THE FRONT

DO NOT MAKE NOISE

WAIT FOR MORNING

IF YOU HEAR THEM, STAY LOW

And underneath, smaller, like whoever wrote it was tired:

SORRY KIDS

Caleb stared at it until his eyes went wet. “Uncle Marty.”

Tessa’s voice went thin. “Morning’s here.”

As if the universe wanted to underline that, there came a heavy thud from the front of the bar. The barricade shifted. Something slammed into it hard enough that a table leg snapped and skittered across the floor.

Then another sound replaced the growls, closer than it should be.

Sniffing.

From the back door.

We all looked at each other.

Caleb’s face went white. “No.”

The sniffing became a slow inhale and exhale, like something taking its time.

The chain rattled gently, like fingers testing it.

Then a low rumble, deep enough to vibrate in my teeth.

Tessa whispered, “They’re behind us too.”

Caleb crouched, peered through the small gap under the board on the back door window. The flashlight was still dead, so we used the thin light leaking in.

Fog bloomed in that gap from something breathing on the other side.

A claw scratched once at the metal.

The squeal made my skin crawl.

“Basement,” I said, because saying anything else meant standing here until the door gave. “O’Rourke’s has a cellar for kegs. Maybe there’s a second exit.”

We shoved beer cases aside and found the cellar door. It opened with a soft sigh like it hadn’t been used in a while.

We went down.

The air got colder, damp, smelling of mold and spilled hops. Caleb used his phone screen for light until it faded to nothing. The cellar was bigger than I remembered. O’Rourke’s had been renovated and patched and expanded over the years. Cheap and quick.

Along the back wall, behind a rolling rack of empties, a narrow corridor led to a metal door.

Not a normal door. Heavy. Industrial.

A keypad sat beside it.

Caleb swept his dead phone screen across it like that could help. “That was not here when I was a kid.”

A crash from upstairs. Then a growl rolling down the stairwell.

Tessa breathed, “They’re inside.”

The keypad lit when I touched it.

ENTER CODE

My eyes dropped to the concrete beside the door, low near the floor. Numbers scratched into it, carved deep like someone didn’t trust ink.

3 1 9 7

My brain jumped to Glen Days without asking permission. The first year the boot drive total broke three thousand, Marty had stood at Main and Holloway with a grin and a cup of bad coffee and kept saying it was a good sign. I was a kid, but I remembered him repeating the number like it mattered.

I entered 3-1-9-7.

The keypad beeped.

A heavy click sounded inside the door.

The latch released.

I pulled the door open.

Cold air rushed out, carrying a smell that didn’t belong in a bar cellar. Clean concrete. Dust. Something electrical.

A narrow passageway stretched away, lit by faint red emergency lights. It sloped down and then leveled out, like it ran under the town.

Behind us, upstairs, a scream tore through the bar. Not a human scream. Something harsh and tearing.

The metal door behind us hit with a slam. It bowed inward slightly.

Caleb’s voice cracked. “Where does this go.”

I listened. Not to him. To the town. To the silence above.

“We keep moving,” I said. “We find where this comes out. We don’t go back up.”

The corridor split ahead.

Left: MAIN ST.

Right: MILLSTONE ACCESS.

Straight ahead, no markings.

Tessa stared at the arrows, breathing fast. “If we go under Main, we can cut toward Holloway.”

“Holloway gets us to the IGA,” I said. “Food, water, flashlights, first aid. Office has a battery radio.”

Caleb swallowed. “You’re pitching the grocery store right now.”

“I’m pitching not dying in my own town’s bar.”

Behind us, the metal door groaned again.

We went toward MAIN ST.

The tunnel narrowed. The air got colder and wetter. Pipes ran along the ceiling, insulation peeling and hanging in strips. Our footsteps sounded wrong. Too loud. Too human.

We passed a maintenance alcove with a folding chair tipped over like someone had gotten up fast. A coffee cup lay shattered, brown stain dried into the concrete.

A scratch sound drifted down the corridor.

Scratch.

Pause.

Scratch.

Caleb whispered, “Tell me that’s a rat.”

Tessa didn’t whisper. She breathed it like it hurt. “That’s not a rat.”

We killed our light, relied on the red emergency blink.

A bend ahead.

The scratch came again, closer.

Then a soft thump.

Then breathing.

Not ours.

We pressed into a shallow recess beside a blue valve wheel. My shoulder scraped concrete. Tessa’s nails dug into my sleeve and stayed there. Caleb’s jaw was clenched so tight I heard his teeth click once.

It came around the bend.

In the red blink, it appeared in pieces. A shoulder first. Then an arm. Then the curve of a head that shouldn’t fit in a place like this.

Bigger than the one outside. Or maybe the tunnel made it feel bigger. It was all wrong angles and weight.

Its fur was darker down here, matted with damp. Ribs showed through in places. It walked with an uneven rhythm, like it could move upright but didn’t do it the way we did. One footfall had a slap to it. The other had a scrape, claws catching the concrete.

It stopped in the middle of the corridor.

Lifted its head.

Sniffed.

Slow, deliberate, like it was tasting the tunnel.

Then it drifted toward us.

Not rushing. Not prowling like something trained to scare. Moving like a hungry thing that has learned patience.

It stopped a few feet from the alcove.

In the blink of red light, its pale eyes flashed dull yellow-gray.

It lowered its head.

Its breath rolled into our space, warm and sour. Wet fur. Old meat left too long.

Tessa’s breath hitched once.

The dogman’s ears twitched.

It turned its head sharply toward the alcove, like that tiny sound was a flare.

It stepped closer.

Caleb tensed beside me, ready to do something stupid and brave. I grabbed his wrist hard and shook my head once.

My eyes caught on the blue valve wheel.

I slid my hand down the wall, fingers closing around cold metal.

The dogman leaned in.

I could see its whiskers twitching.

Its lips lifted slightly, not a full snarl, something worse. Anticipation.

I turned the wheel.

It squealed, loud and metallic.

The dogman flinched, head snapping toward the sound.

I turned harder.

The valve gave with a gritty jerk. Then the pipe behind the wall released pressure with a violent hiss, like a giant snake waking up angry. Air or steam blasted out through a seam, screaming down the corridor and bouncing off concrete.

The dogman recoiled, startled. It snapped at the air like it wanted to bite the sound.

“Move,” I breathed at Caleb and Tessa. “Now.”

We slid out while it was focused on the hissing, bodies low, feet careful. The dogman turned its head, confused.

Then it saw motion.

Its body tightened.

We ran.

Not a sprint. Not loud. The fastest we could move without stomping.

The dogman launched after us, claws skittering and catching, growl vibrating through the tunnel like a bass note.

Ahead, a fork.

Left: HOLLOWAY RUN.

Right: MAIN ST. SERVICE.

“Holloway,” I gasped. “IGA.”

We cut left.

The dogman hit the junction behind us, skidded, chose our path without hesitation.

The tunnel sloped upward now. The smell changed slightly, more earthy, like creek mud. Grates in the floor every so often. Storm access.

A metal ladder bolted to the wall came into view, leading up to a circular hatch.

“Ladder,” I said.

Caleb climbed first, hands slipping once. Tessa went next, boots scraping rungs. I went last, my palms sweating so bad I nearly lost the hammer.

The hatch had a rotating latch. Caleb fumbled it, got it.

Below, the dogman slammed into the ladder base. The whole thing shuddered. My teeth clicked together.

Tessa made a short involuntary sound and clamped her hand over her mouth.

The dogman snapped upward, jaws clacking inches below my boots. One long hand reached, claws scraping metal.

The hatch opened.

Cold air poured down, fresher, carrying asphalt and winter.

“Up,” Caleb snapped.

I shoved through and rolled onto rough ground.

Caleb grabbed my jacket and yanked me fully out.

Gray morning. Low clouds. The sky the color of dirty dishwater.

We were in a strip of brush and cracked pavement behind the Briar Glen IGA loading area. Beige back wall stained from years of deliveries. Dumpsters in their usual spot. The chain-link gate half open like someone pushed through fast.

The IGA sign was visible around the corner, red letters dull in the morning light.

Caleb slammed the hatch down as the dogman’s head surged into view. For half a second I saw its eyes at the opening, its muzzle pushing up, lips curled back in a silent snarl.

Then the hatch clanged shut.

Caleb dropped his weight on it and twisted the latch.

The metal bucked under him. It hit from below, hard enough to jolt the ground.

The latch held.

For now.

We didn’t stay.

We ran along the back of the store, staying low, using dumpsters and pallets as cover. The town was too quiet. No delivery truck. No employee cars. No morning anything. The two-tone water tower rose over rooftops with BRIAR GLEN in peeling white letters, watching like it always did. It didn’t feel like home anymore. It felt like a marker on a map you can’t leave.

“How do we get inside,” Tessa whispered.

“Front doors are glass,” I said. “Bad idea. Back employee entrance by the dock.”

We reached it.

The metal employee door wasn’t locked. The handle turned like someone forgot. Or like someone left it that way.

We slipped into the back hallway.

The smell hit me so hard it almost made me lightheaded. Cardboard, floor wax, old produce. That faint sweet rot of bananas that are about to go bad.

Normal.

Except the lights were off. Emergency lighting cast weak illumination down the corridor. The store itself was dark beyond the swinging double doors.

Tessa whispered, “Do you hear that.”

At first I didn’t.

Then I did.

A slow scrape from somewhere out in the aisles.

Claws on tile.

Then a low growl, muted by walls, steady like it belonged here.

Caleb’s eyes went wide. “No.”

I held up a hand, forcing both of them still.

The scrape came again.

Closer.

I knew every aisle in this place. I knew which tiles squeaked near dairy. I knew the back room camera was fake because the real one had been broken for months and nobody wanted to pay to replace it. I knew where the first aid kit was. Where the office radio sat. Where the pallet jacks were kept. I knew the IGA the way you know your own house.

And something tall and hungry was moving through it like it owned the aisles.

“We don’t run blind,” I whispered. “We don’t make noise. We use what we know. Step where I step.”

Caleb nodded like his neck was stiff.

We slipped through the swinging doors.

The dark swallowed the aisle.

Caleb kept the flashlight off. Tessa’s hand clamped the back of my jacket so hard I could feel her nails through denim.

I placed my feet on the tiles I knew didn’t squeak.

A shape moved at the end of Aisle Two.

It slid between the endcap displays like it was built for narrow spaces. Tall shoulders ducking under a hanging SALE banner. Muzzle turning, nose working.

It caught our scent.

Its head snapped toward us.

The growl that came out of it wasn’t loud.

It was controlled. Certain.

My skin prickled. My throat went tight like I’d swallowed something wrong.

The dogman stepped into the aisle.

Emergency lighting blinked and showed it in pieces. Matted fur. Long arms. Claws tapping once, a small sound that felt huge.

Then the lights dimmed again and it was mostly outline.

It started toward us.

Fast.

I lunged for the endcap and yanked the first thing my hands found, an upright cardboard chip display. It toppled with a crackling avalanche.

The dogman barreled through it like it was smoke.

Tessa gasped. A sharp involuntary sound.

The dogman’s ears twitched.

It surged.

“Run,” I hissed.

We bolted down the aisle, not straight. Zigzagging around stacks of canned soup and paper towels. My shoulder clipped a shelf and cans rattled.

The sound was a dinner bell.

The dogman hit the aisle behind us with that slap-scrape gait, gaining every step.

Caleb whipped around the endcap and almost ate tile. I grabbed his arm and yanked him upright. His skin was clammy. My own hands felt too slick on everything.

Ahead: the back hallway. The employee door. The office at the far end.

We ran for it.

The dogman hit the corner and the air changed. Hot breath behind us. Close enough I felt it.

It lunged.

Wind passed my shoulder.

Tessa screamed, not on purpose, full and terrified, and the sound bounced off shelves and came back twice as loud.

The dogman answered with a roar that shook the aisle signage.

It came again.

I spun and swung the hammer.

Metal met something hard in its face. A crack traveled up my wrist and into my elbow. My fingers went numb for a second.

The dogman recoiled half a step, surprised more than hurt.

Its lips peeled back.

Not a snarl. A decision.

It snapped at my forearm. Teeth grazed my sleeve. Heat. Pressure. A sting like a burn.

I yanked back, stumbled, and my heel caught a pallet edge.

I went down hard.

Tile hit my spine and knocked breath out of me in a grunt I couldn’t stop.

The dogman was on me immediately, shadow filling the aisle. It straddled my legs, paws on either side of my ribs, and lowered its head like it meant to bite my throat clean open.

I saw its eyes up close. Pale, dead-looking, focused.

My mind went blank except for one ugly thought.

This is how people die. On grocery store tile, under emergency lights, in a town nobody outside cares about.

Tessa moved.

She grabbed a glass jar from the shelf, pasta sauce, and smashed it against the side of its head.

The jar burst. Red sauce and glass sprayed.

The dogman snapped sideways and bit at her arm, missing by inches, jaws clacking hard enough I felt it in my teeth.

Caleb dove in and kicked it in the ribs.

It didn’t fall.

It turned on him with a sound like hate.

Caleb froze a half-second too long.

I shoved the hammer up into the underside of its jaw, both hands on the handle. The blow lifted its head and bought me a heartbeat.

I scrambled backward on my elbows, palms burning from friction. My arm felt wet and hot where the teeth had grazed.

“Move,” I rasped at Caleb.

He did, stumbling down the aisle.

The dogman shook its head violently, flinging sauce and spit. It looked offended.

Then it charged again.

I grabbed the nearest cart and shoved it forward like a battering ram.

The cart hit its knees.

It stumbled.

For one heartbeat, the cart pinned its legs.

“Back hall,” I shouted, and my voice sounded wrong, cracked, too loud.

Caleb and Tessa ran.

The dogman ripped the cart aside like it weighed nothing and came after us.

We burst into the back hallway.

The air smelled like cardboard and cleaning chemicals. A weak emergency light flickered above the loading area. The office door was ahead.

Caleb slammed into it, rattled the handle.

Locked.

“It’s locked,” he choked.

Of course it was. Management always locked it. My key ring was on my belt loop.

My hands fumbled like they belonged to somebody else. The metal key teeth scraped the lock twice before I got it in.

The dogman hit the swinging doors behind us.

They slapped open.

It stepped into the hallway, shoulders scraping the frame, claws clicking on concrete.

It lowered its head and started forward, slow now, savoring it.

Tessa backed up until her shoulders hit cinderblock. No room left.

I turned the key. The office door popped open.

“In,” I barked.

Tessa shoved Caleb through.

I followed, half-turned, hammer up.

The dogman lunged.

I slammed the door in its face.

The metal door shook in the frame.

It slammed back harder. The hinges screamed.

Caleb threw his weight against the door, shoulder first, face twisting. “What now.”

The dogman hit again and the whole door flexed.

I scanned the office in a single desperate sweep. Desk. Old computer. Corkboard with schedules. First aid kit. A radio on the shelf. Fire extinguisher mounted by the filing cabinet. A thin beige maintenance door marked EMPLOYEES ONLY.

And the freezer keys on a hook.

I yanked the extinguisher down and shoved it into Tessa’s hands. “If it gets in, blast its eyes.”

Her fingers tightened around it like she wasn’t sure she could lift it.

I grabbed the freezer keys and ripped open the maintenance door.

“Back corridor,” I said. “It leads to the walk-ins.”

Another slam. The office door window spiderwebbed.

A paw punched through, claws slicing air.

Tessa made a sound that wasn’t a word.

“Now,” I snapped.

We spilled into the maintenance corridor, narrow concrete, stale air. The overhead light was out. Only the red emergency glow bled under doors.

Behind us, the office door howled with impacts.

We ran for the walk-in freezer.

The first freezer door was thick white metal with a rubber seal. I jammed the key into the lock, turned it, hauled it open.

Cold hit us like a slap.

We piled inside between stacked boxes of frozen fries and shrink-wrapped meat trays. Our breath turned to clouds immediately. My fingers went numb so fast it felt like pins.

I slammed the freezer door shut.

The world went muffled. The seal swallowed sound.

For one second there was only the hum of the freezer unit and our breathing, ragged and loud in the cold.

Then a crash outside.

The office door gave.

Footfalls. Fast. Heavy.

The dogman was loose.

It hit the maintenance corridor with a snuffling growl, nails scraping, searching.

It moved close enough that I could hear the wet sniffing at the seam.

A claw tapped the freezer door once.

Then again.

Then a slow drag down metal, a sound that made my teeth ache.

The handle rattled.

Tessa’s teeth chattered. “It can’t open this, right.”

The handle jerked harder.

It slammed its shoulder into the door.

The freezer shuddered. Boxes shifted. Frost dust rained down.

It slammed again.

The seal creaked.

Caleb pressed both hands to the door like he could hold it shut by force of will.

I looked around the freezer interior, mind racing. Metal shelving. A pallet jack shoved in the corner. A vent panel near the back, old service access, held on by screws.

Pliers.

I yanked them out and started twisting screws with numb fingers. Each turn felt slow. My hands didn’t want to obey.

Outside, another slam. The door bowed inward a fraction.

Caleb’s voice cracked. “Evan.”

“I’m working,” I grunted.

Tessa crouched beside me and held the panel steady, trembling so hard the metal rattled against the wall.

The last screw dropped into frost with a tiny ping.

I yanked the panel free.

Behind it, a narrow service gap between this freezer and the next. Just big enough to squeeze through sideways.

“One at a time,” I said. “Go.”

Caleb wedged himself in and disappeared, scraping against metal. Tessa followed, extinguisher clutched to her chest like a baby.

The handle outside jerked violently.

The dogman roared, furious.

The latch squealed.

The door began to open.

I shoved into the service gap.

Cold metal scraped my shoulder. Something snagged my sleeve and tore fabric with a sharp rip. My skin stung. I yanked free and dropped into the adjacent freezer with a thud that knocked the air out of me.

Caleb hauled me up by the arm.

This freezer held ice cream and frozen pizzas, tubs of sherbet stacked like bricks. The hum was louder here. My ears rang.

Tessa pressed her ear to the wall, face white.

On the other side, the dogman crashed into boxes, shelves rattling. It had followed our scent into the first freezer.

Its breath came hard and angry.

It found the service gap.

A pale eye appeared at the opening, part of its muzzle, wet black nose filling the space. It snapped at the air, teeth clacking inches from my fingers.

I jerked back.

It shoved harder, trying to force its head through.

It couldn’t fit.

It snarled and rammed its shoulder into the freezer wall. The wall shuddered. The gap widened a hair.

We couldn’t stay.

I looked at the floor in the first freezer through the gap. Frost and meltwater near the drain. Always a puddle there.

Then I looked at the busted wiring behind the freezer panels near the back, the conduit lines and compressor hookups.

Cold, water, metal.

I grabbed a case of bottled water from the corner and shoved it toward the gap.

Caleb blinked. “What are you doing.”

“Making the floor wet,” I said, and my voice sounded flat because fear was chewing the edges off my tone.

I twisted caps off and poured bottles through into the first freezer. Water splashed. Sloshed. Began to turn slick on the cold floor.

The dogman shoved its arm through the gap, long clawed fingers reaching like hooks.

It swiped.

Tessa flinched so hard her shoulder hit a stack of pizza boxes, but she didn’t scream this time. She bit down on it. I saw her jaw tremble.

We needed out.

I spotted the second freezer’s exit door, the one that led back into the store near frozen foods.

“Exit,” I breathed. “We go now.”

Caleb grabbed the handle.

The dogman shoved its arm through again, claws scraping metal, reaching farther.

Tessa fired the extinguisher into the gap on instinct.

White powder blasted into its face.

The dogman choked and recoiled, coughing, furious.

“Go,” I snapped.

Caleb yanked the freezer door open.

We spilled out into the dark store near the frozen foods aisle. The emergency lights flickered, making the glass freezer doors flash like mirrors. The air out here felt warm compared to the freezer, but my skin was still numb, my hands shaking so bad I almost dropped the hammer.

Behind us, the dogman thrashed inside the first freezer, slipping on the wet floor.

It hit the door.

Its claws scraped.

It slipped again. A heavy thud.

A roar turned ragged, strangled.

The first freezer door began to pull shut on its own, the cold keeping mechanism doing what it was built to do. The handle clacked.

Click.

The latch caught.

The dogman slammed the door from inside.

Metal rang. It roared again, and it sounded trapped.

We didn’t stop moving.

We ran past the deli counter, past holiday tinsel that still hung in thin sad strands, past the pharmacy aisle, past the endcap that still had a “WINTER SAVINGS” sign dangling crooked.

We reached the manager’s desk near the front.

The boarded windows and morning light beyond looked wrong, like someone boarded up the world.

Caleb spun in a tight circle, wild-eyed. “Where do we go.”

I didn’t get to answer.

The first freezer door bucked open.

The dogman came out like a missile, fur caked in white extinguisher dust, muzzle wet, lips pulled back.

It hit the tile and skated.

It tried to correct.

It went down hard, full body slam that shook shelves.

It scrambled to rise, claws slipping on the slick patch.

I saw the pallet jack near the stock room entrance, left out for morning deliveries. Its handle stood up like a hook.

Caleb looked at it, then at me.

No talking.

He sprinted and grabbed the handle, yanked.

The pallet jack rattled into motion, wheels squealing. The squeal made my stomach drop, but it was too late to care.

The dogman got one foot under it and started to push up.

I ran straight at it with the hammer raised, and every instinct screamed this was how I died.

It lunged even from the floor, jaws snapping.

I swung.

The hammer connected with its snout again. Bone and teeth and a wet crack. It yelped, an ugly animal sound, then snapped at my leg. Teeth grazed denim and caught skin. A sting. Heat. I nearly screamed and didn’t. I don’t know how. My throat made a small broken sound instead.

Caleb drove the pallet jack forward.

The metal forks hit the dogman’s torso.

It tried to twist away.

Its claws scrabbled for purchase and found only wet tile.

Caleb shoved again, face contorted, shoulders burning.

The dogman slid backward toward the row of glass freezer doors.

It hit them.

Glass boomed.

Not shattered yet, but stressed.

The dogman roared and tried to climb over the forks, blinded by powder, furious.

Tessa ran in from the side, still clutching the extinguisher, tears cutting lines through white dust on her cheeks.

She blasted again, directly into its face.

The dogman gagged and shook, snapping at nothing.

Caleb shoved.

The pallet jack drove it sideways into the freezer doors again.

This time the glass gave.

It didn’t explode outward cleanly. It fractured thickly and fell inward in heavy chunks, collapsing into the freezer bay.

The dogman went with it, half its body plunging into broken panels.

Behind the panels, exposed wiring sparked, tiny blue-white flashes.

The dogman thrashed. Its wet fur smeared across metal and wiring.

A sharp pop snapped through the air.

The emergency lights flickered and went bright for half a second.

The dogman convulsed.

Its roar cut off into a choked, involuntary sound.

Its limbs jerked, violent and wrong.

The smell hit. Burnt hair, sharp and awful, mixed with freezer frost.

Caleb stumbled back, panting like he’d been underwater.

Tessa froze, extinguisher hanging from her hands like it weighed a hundred pounds.

The dogman’s body kept spasming for a moment, then slowed.

One last shudder.

Then still.

The store went quiet except for the hum of the freezers and our breathing.

I didn’t move for a long beat. My hands shook so hard the hammer nearly slipped. My vision tunneled and the edges of the world felt too bright, like the emergency lights were drilling into my skull.

Caleb spoke first, voice broken. “Is it… is it—”

I stepped closer, hammer up, because I didn’t trust anything anymore. I watched its chest.

Nothing.

No rise. No twitch.

Its pale eyes stared at nothing.

It was dead.

Tessa slid down an endcap and sat hard on the floor like her legs had given up. She pressed her palm to her mouth and tried to keep from sobbing loud.

Caleb bent over, hands on his knees, staring at the broken freezer bay like he couldn’t understand what we’d just done.

I backed away from the body and went to the manager’s desk. The battery radio was there, old and taped, labeled KEEP CHARGED.

My fingers were numb and clumsy, but I flicked it on.

Static.

I turned the dial.

More static.

Then a faint voice, distant and warbled like it was coming through bad weather.

“…stay indoors… do not…” the voice crackled, “…if you hear—”

It cut back to static.

My stomach dropped anyway.

That meant there were people out there trying to warn someone.

Which meant this wasn’t just one creature in one building.

I looked at Caleb and Tessa. Both coated in powder. Both shaking. Both alive.

My arm burned where teeth had grazed. My leg burned where it caught skin. The pain was real and grounding, which is a sick thing to appreciate, but I did.

“We’re not staying out in the open,” I said, keeping my voice low. “We barricade the back corridor. We get the office first aid. We find anything we can use. Then we figure out where the hell everyone is.”

Caleb nodded, eyes red. “Okay.”

Tessa wiped her face with the back of her hand, leaving a streak of white across her cheek, and nodded too. Small. Fierce. Terrified.

I glanced once more at the broken freezer bay and the dogman’s body half inside it, fur dusted like snow.

Then I turned away before my brain could make it fully real and break me in half.

I’m writing this as fast as I can while we have a door between us and whatever else is in Briar Glen.

1q2zlut,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q2zlut/the_fifth_offering/,The Fifth Offering,"The ferry cut through the grey waters of the fjord, its diesel engine thrumming a steady rhythm that Ben Carter, a twenty-five-year-old photographer with perpetually tousled hair and a camera that seemed permanently attached to his hand, felt in his chest. He stood at the railing, capturing the dramatic cliffs that rose on either side like ancient sentinels, hoping to add a career-making shot of the aurora borealis to his portfolio. The late-September air was crisp, carrying the salt tang of the sea and the faint scent of pine from the forested slopes above.

""It's beautiful, isn't it?"" Chloe Miller, the youngest of the group at twenty-three, appeared beside him, her bright, curious eyes taking in everything. She had organized this trip as a post-graduation adventure, a final taste of freedom before starting her career, and her enthusiasm was infectious.

Ben lowered his camera and smiled at her. ""It’s stunning. The light here is incredible. That golden hour is going to be perfect for the aurora shots tonight."" Behind them, Jessica ""Jess"" Davis, a twenty-nine-year-old travel blogger dressed in stylish, brightly colored outdoor gear, was already filming a selfie video for her half-million followers. ""Hey guys! Just arriving in the most amazing little Norwegian town. The scenery is absolutely epic. Can't wait to show you the Aurora! Don't forget to like and subscribe!"" David Chen, a thirty-eight-year-old software engineer from San Francisco who had the weary look of a man escaping a stressful job, looked up from his tablet with a faint, tired smile. ""She never stops, does she?""

""It's her job,"" Chloe said quietly. ""She has half a million followers. That's got to be a lot of pressure to produce content constantly.""

Dr. Michael Grant, a professor of Scandinavian folklore in his mid-forties, joined them at the railing, his tweed jacket and thoughtful expression marking him as an academic. He had joined the tour specifically to research the area's local legends. ""I must admit, this is even more remote than I anticipated.""

""You really think you'll find something for your research here, Professor?"" Ben asked. ""Oh, I'm sure of it,"" Grant said, his eyes gleaming. ""These isolated communities are treasure troves of folklore. Stories that have been passed down for generations, untouched by the modern world.""

The ferry rounded a final bend in the fjord, and the town of Kråkvik came into view. It was a cluster of colorful wooden buildings, reds, yellows, and whites, clinging to the rocky shore. Fishing boats bobbed in the small harbor, and beyond them, wooden drying racks stood like skeletal fingers against the grey sky, hung with cod splitting in the cold air. As they disembarked, Ben couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched. He turned, scanning the handful of locals who'd gathered at the dock, but they were all occupied with their own business, unloading crates, mending nets, and talking in low voices. Still, the feeling persisted. Their hotel, the Sjøhus Inn, was a converted warehouse overlooking the harbor. The owner, a taciturn woman named Fru Nilsen, checked them in with minimal conversation and handed over three room keys. Chloe and Jess would share a room, Ben and David another, and Dr. Grant had a single. ""The town tour begins at four,"" Fru Nilsen said in heavily accented English. ""Dinner with the group is at seven. Tomorrow, you have the outskirts tour in the morning. The buses to the lighthouse leave tomorrow night at eight, before the tide comes in."" ""Buses?"" Jess asked. ""Plural?""

""There are thirty-two people signed up for the aurora viewing,"" Fru Nilsen explained, “Four buses. You are in the first group."" After settling into their rooms, the group reconvened in the hotel lobby. They had three hours before the town tour began, and Chloe was eager to explore. Kråkvik was a working fishing village, not a tourist destination. The streets were narrow and uneven, the buildings weathered by salt and wind. A small grocery store, a post office, a church with a distinctive steeple, and three pubs made up the town's amenities. But there was a stark beauty to it, a sense of timelessness that Ben found compelling.

They wandered down to the harbor, where the fishing boats creaked against their moorings. The smell of fish was inescapable. Gulls swooped in and fought over scraps, their cries echoing off the water. An old man sat on an overturned crate near the end of the pier, mending a net with gnarled, weathered hands. He was ancient, his face a map of wrinkles, his eyes pale blue and rheumy. He wore a thick wool sweater and rubber boots, and a pipe jutted from the corner of his mouth. As they approached, he looked up and fixed His eyes on Chloe.

""Excuse me,"" Chloe said politely. ""We're visiting for the aurora viewing at the lighthouse."" The old man's hands stilled. His English was broken, heavily accented. ""Storholmen?"" ""Yes,"" Chloe said. ""Is something wrong?"" The old man stood abruptly, his movements surprisingly quick for someone his age. He stepped closer. ""No go,"" the old man said urgently. He grabbed Chloe's arm, his grip surprisingly strong. ""No, go Storholmen. Is... is bad place. farlig."" Stepping to her side, Ben firmly said, ""Sir, please let go of her,"". The old man slowly released his grip on her but didn't step back. His pale eyes were wide, almost wild. ""The drunket,"" he said. ""People go. People no come back. Vannet... takes them."" ""What drownings?"" Dr. Grant asked, suddenly interested. He pulled out a small notebook. The old man's gaze darted to Dr. Grant, then back to Chloe. He seemed to be struggling with the English words.

""The... the musikk. You hear musikk, you no listen. You hear musikk, you run. Is..."" He gestured frantically, searching for the word. ""Is not ekte. Is him."" ""Him?"" Jess prompted gently. ""Våtmannen,"" the old man said, his voice dropping to a whisper. He made a gesture, running his hands down his face and body, as if indicating water dripping. ""He play the Hardingfele"" He mimed playing a stringed instrument. ""A Hardanger Fiddle?"" Dr. Grant translated. ""Ja! Ja!"" The old man nodded vigorously. ""Gyllen Hardingfele. He play, you listen, You drunket. Many people."" David laughed uncomfortably. ""Sounds like an urban legend."" The old man's expression hardened. ""Is not myte. Is real. I see him. femti år ago, I see him. My bror..."" His voice broke. ""My bror hear the musikk. He walk into the sea. I try to stop him, but..."" He shook his head. ""He no hear me. He only hear musikk. He drunket.""

An uncomfortable silence fell over the group. The old man's pain was palpable, whether his story was true or not. ""I'm very sorry about your bror,"" Chloe said softly. The old man grasped her hand in his gently, ""Please. No go Storholmen. Is bad place. Våtmannen, he jaktar there.""

""Olav!"" A sharp voice cut through the air. A younger man strode down the pier toward them. He spoke rapidly in Norwegian to the old man, his tone scolding. The old man argued back, gesturing at the group, but the younger man took his arm and began leading him away. ""I apologize,"" the younger man said in perfect English. ""My father, he... he has dementia. He tells these stories to tourists. Please don't take it seriously."" ""He seemed very sincere,"" Dr. Grant said. The younger man's expression was tight. ""He believes what he says. But it's not real. There are no mysterious drownings. There have been accidents over the years, yes, this is a fishing village, and people drown. But there's no monster."" He forced a smile. ""Enjoy your visit to Kråkvik. The Aurora is beautiful. You'll love it!""

He led the old man away, still speaking in low, urgent Norwegian. The old man looked back, his pale eyes finding Chloe's, and mouthed something she couldn't quite make out. ""Well,"" David said after a moment. ""That was unsettling."" ""Poor man,"" Jess said. ""Losing a brother like that... It's no wonder he's traumatized."" ""But the specificity,"" Dr. Grant murmured, scribbling in his notebook. ""The wet man. The golden fiddle. The music. These are classic elements of Scandinavian water spirit folklore. The Nøkken, specifically.""

""The what?"" Ben asked. ""Nøkken. A Norwegian water spirit. Male, shapeshifting, plays enchanted music to lure victims to drown. There are hundreds of stories about them throughout Scandinavia."" Grant's eyes gleamed with academic interest. ""I wonder if there's a local variant of the legend here."" ""You're not seriously considering this,"" David said. ""Of course, not as a literal truth,"" Grant replied. ""But folklore often has roots in real events. Perhaps there were drownings near the lighthouse, and the locals created a legend to explain them. It's fascinating, really."" Though the afternoon wasn't particularly cold, a shiver ran down Chloe\`s spine. ""Let's head back. The tour starts soon.""

The town tour was led by a cheerful young woman named Signe, who spoke excellent English and seemed determined to present Kråkvik in the best possible light. She showed them the church, the fish processing plant, and the small museum dedicated to the town's fishing heritage. She mentioned nothing about drownings or water spirits. At seven, they gathered with the other tourists, a mix of nationalities, mostly couples and small groups, in the dining room of the Sjøhus Inn. The meal was traditional Norwegian fare: fish soup, roasted cod, boiled potatoes, and lingonberry sauce.

The food was simple but delicious. As they ate, Jess couldn't resist telling the story of the old fisherman for her blog, narrating into her phone. ""So, this ancient guy grabs Chloe's arm and starts going on about a 'wet man' who plays a golden fiddle and drowns people. Proper horror movie stuff, right? What do you guys think? Let me know in the comments!""

Several people at nearby tables turned to listen. Chloe wished Jess would be more discreet. ""A wet man?"" one of the other tourists asked, an American woman in her fifties. ""Is that a cryptid?"" ""More like a water spirit,"" Dr. Grant explained. ""The Nøkken, from Norwegian folklore. They're said to---, "" ""More wine?"" A waiter appeared at their table with almost aggressive speed, interrupting Grant mid-sentence.

He was young, perhaps twenty-five, with the same weathered look as most of the locals. ""Or perhaps dessert? We have cloudberry cream tonight."" ""We're fine for now,"" David said, slightly taken aback by the interruption. ""The fish was excellent,"" Ben added. The waiter nodded curtly and moved away, but Chloe noticed he lingered nearby, close enough to overhear their conversation. When Dr. Grant started to continue the explanation, the waiter reappeared. ""How is your meal?"" he asked, his smile not reaching his eyes. ""Everything to your satisfaction?"" ""Yes, thank you,"" Chloe said. ""Good, good. And you are excited for the lighthouse? The aurora should be spectacular."" ""We're looking forward to it,"" David said curtly, his annoyance at the continued interruptions beginning to show.

The waiter nodded and finally moved away, but the interruption had killed the conversation. Jess shrugged and returned to her meal. But Chloe noticed the waiter watching them from across the room, and she wasn't the only one. Several of the staff seemed unusually attentive to their table. Ben cleared his throat to clear the tension and asked Dr. Grant, “What made you choose a Doctorate in Norwegian Folklore?” Dr. Grant stammered a bit, “a-ah, I love the thrill of chasing a dream, and maybe never catching it. “That\`s. Deep?” replied Ben as Dr. Grant quietly got up and left the room.

Chloe noticed the doctor had been gone for a while. Being the people-pleaser type, she chased after him, giving him space while letting him know she was there. He walked out to the smoking balcony and pulled out a cigarette. A moment later, Chloe stepped up with a smile and a lighter, “Need a light?” Her cheeks pulled wide in a pantomime of innocence. “Thanks, Chloe.” She lit the tip of his cigarette, and he puffed on it a few times to engage the flame. “So, your reason for choosing folklore back there, I don’t buy it, and I noticed that it made you uncomfortable enough to leave a party in our honor. I’m not saying you have to tell me, I’m just making sure you’re okay.”

Dr. Grant shallowly nodded his head a few times, as if he was giving himself a pep talk. He let out a reedy sigh before speaking, “No, I should be able to talk about it, I’m an adult, and it's been over 20 years now.” He paused a second to rally himself, “I had a daughter once, her name was Lilly, and she was the light of my life. But I was working long hours at my trading firm, and in the end, I chose to neglect everything and everyone in pursuit of the almighty dollar. One night, I was supposed to pick her up from soccer practice, but the market crashed, and I chose to try to salvage my earnings. The police only found her left shoe and a small hand-carved doll in her likeness.

The search dragged on for months with no progress. I was spending my days combing the woods and my nights drawing at the bar. The night I was considering ending it all, I overheard a couple of Folklore and Mythology majors discussing the Fae for their project. They were listing the traits of some of the monsters, and a carved doll effigy was among them. It suddenly all made sense: why no one could find her, why there was no sign of the abductor, and most puzzling of all, the effigy. I realized her abduction must be supernatural in origin.

This was a pretty shocking revelation: the Fae actually existed! I immediately sought the professor, a man named Gregarson, and together we uncovered enough circumstantial evidence to conclude that a Fae had taken her. Driven by my obsession, I devoted my entire life to the study of Folklore and the search for the creature that kidnapped my daughter.

To date, I have exautivly disproven several sightings and uncovered the true stories behind some local village legends, but I have not learned anything new about my daughters' abductors.” Dr. Grant hung his head as he spoke the last line, vainly trying to hide his eyes as they began to water. “Are you alright, Doctor?” Chloe asked with concern, noting his shift in demeanor. “Yes, I-I will be alright, thank you, Chloe. I should prepare for tomorrow's tours, good night,” Dr. Grant finished and made his way to the exit. Chloe felt a deep sadness as she watched the broken man shamble away. It was clear that he had chosen to believe a fairytale over the harsh reality of what he had done. She decided to return to the others but keep this exchange to herself.

After dinner, the group returned to their rooms to rest before tomorrow's busy day. Ben spent the time checking his equipment, while Chloe lay on the bed scrolling through the photos they'd taken that day. ""Look at this,"" she said suddenly. Ben came over. She'd zoomed in on a photo of the harbor, taken that afternoon. In the background, barely visible among the fishing boats, was a figure. A man, standing on one of the boats, facing the camera. The distance and quality made the details impossible to discern, but something was unsettling about the way he stood, perfectly still, while everything else in the frame moved. ""Probably just a fisherman,"" Ben said. ""Probably,"" Chloe agreed. But she didn't sound convinced.

Chloe awoke suddenly. The hotel room was dark except for the faint glow of the alarm clock: 10:32 PM. The faint, ethereal sound of music had woken her, a stringed instrument. It was beautiful and haunting, and sounded as if it were coming from outside. She slipped out of bed and crept to the window, peering through the glass. The harbor was dark, the fishing boats were silhouettes against the inky water. On the pier where they'd met the old man earlier, stood a figure. He was tall and slender, dressed in what looked like old-fashioned clothes, a long coat, breeches, and high boots. He was holding a golden fiddle, its surface gleaming even in the faint moonlight.

As she watched, he looked up, his face a pale oval in the darkness. He seemed to be looking right at her. A cold dread washed over Chloe. She stumbled back from the window, her heart pounding. She squeezed her eyes shut, and when she opened them again, he was gone. She stood there for a long time, her heart racing. It was just a dream, she told herself. A nightmare, brought on by the old man's story. But the music... the music had felt so real.

The next morning, the sky was a bruised purple, the air laden with the promise of a storm. The group met for breakfast, their conversation subdued. Chloe didn't mention her experience. She was sure they'd tell her she should skip the tour and get some rest; instead, their morning was spent on a guided tour of the outskirts of Kråkvik, a ""slice of life"" experience designed to show them the realities of rural Norwegian life. Their first stop was a small, windswept sheep farm overlooking the sea. The air was thick with the smell of lanolin and damp earth. The farmer, a weathered man named Lars with a face as rugged as the coastline, communicated more through his work than his words.

He gave a masterful demonstration of sheep shearing, his hands moving with a speed and precision that left Jess struggling to get a good shot for her blog, adding to the others' amusement. One of the Lambs bolted from her during an attempt at a selfie. Next, they visited a fish-smoking hut, an ancient, dark building where the air was thick with the aromatic smoke of alder wood and salt. Hundreds of cod hung from the rafters like leathery ghosts, their bodies slowly turning golden in the gloom.

The owner, a silent, pipe-smoking man, simply nodded at them as they entered, his presence as much a part of the atmosphere as the smoke itself. David, the software engineer, looked particularly out of place, his city clothes a stark contrast to the raw, elemental nature of the place. Dr. Grant called it ""a temple to the bounty and brutality of the sea."" Their final stop was the cottage of a woman named Astrid, a tiny, cheerful woman with a galaxy of wrinkles around her kind eyes. Her home had a traditional sod roof and a small, meticulously tended vegetable garden. Inside, it was warm and smelled of coffee and cardamom. Astrid showed them how to make lefse, the traditional Norwegian flatbread, on a cast-iron stove that had been in her family for generations. She offered them a piece, warm and spread with butter and sugar. It was simple, perfect, and deeply comforting.

Suddenly, Ben felt the call of nature. Astrid smiled and pointed him to the hallway leading towards the rear of the house. As he walked down the narrow hallway, a flickering light from a slightly ajar door caught his eye. Curiosity piqued, he peeked inside. It was a small, dark room, almost a closet. On a small table was a shrine. In the center stood a small, hand-carved statuette of a fisherman, dressed in what looked like 1600s-era clothing. At its feet was a small, shallow bowl of water, its surface reflecting the flickering candlelight of a single, tall candle. The air was thick with the smell of wax and something else that he couldn't place.

Ben stared for a moment, an uneasy feeling creeping over him. He quickly used the bathroom and rejoined the group. As they walked back toward the bus, he told the others what he'd seen. Dr. Grant nodded thoughtfully. ""Sounds like a fisherman's shrine. It's an old tradition. Families would have them in their homes to pray for the safety of their loved ones at sea. A small offering of water, a candle to light their way home. It's a way of showing respect to the sea, of asking for its mercy."" Chloe went pale. The casual academic explanation did nothing to calm the sudden, frantic beating of her heart. ""The long coat,"" she whispered, her voice trembling. ""The boots... the clothes... they were from the 1600s."" The others looked at her, confused. ""What are you talking about?"" David asked. ""My dream,"" she said, her eyes wide with dawning horror. ""The man I saw outside the window was wearing the same clothes."" An uncomfortable silence fell over the group, the comforting warmth of Astrid's cottage replaced by a creeping dread. The remainder of the trip was uneventful, and the spine-chilling revelation slowly faded into memory as the group took in Scandinavia's untouched splendor.

That evening, the group gathered at the designated bus stop, the wind whipping at their jackets. The sky was now a dark, angry grey. They were the first to arrive, well ahead of the other tourists. ""I don't like the look of that sky,"" David said, his voice tight. When the first bus pulled up, Jess had an idea. ""I'll give you five hundred kroner if you take us to the lighthouse now, ahead of the others,"" she said to the driver, a young man with a bored expression. ""We want to get the best spot for photos."" The driver's eyes lit up at the sight of the cash. He glanced around, then shrugged. ""Get in,"" he said.

As they drove, the storm began to break. Rain lashed against the windows, and the wind buffeted the bus as it crossed the narrow causeway, the only road connecting the lighthouse island to the mainland. ""Are you sure we'll be safe out there?"" Dr. Grant asked, his voice laced with concern. ""The lighthouse has been decommissioned for decades, hasn't it?"" The driver laughed. ""Don't worry. A few years ago, a wealthy benefactor bought the whole island. Poured millions into it. The lighthouse is completely remodeled, state of the art. Safer than your own home now. There's even a little museum in the basement with all the old stuff.""

He pulled up to the base of the lighthouse, a towering black and white cylinder against the stormy sky. ""Here you are. I'll be back in about forty minutes with the others. Explore, take your photos. Just stay inside if the weather gets bad."" Dr. Grant leaned forward, his brow furrowed. ""I have to ask, you're American, aren't you? Your accent. How did you end up driving a tour bus in rural Norway?"" The driver glanced at him in the rearview mirror, his smile quick and professional. ""A Work visa, good pay, and a Beautiful country."" He gestured out at the storm. ""Though the weather takes some getting used to.""

He turned the bus around and headed back across the causeway. As it drove away, a light post lit up the logo on the back of the bus; it was a hollow cog wheel with the initials SJ in red and black letters. ""Huh,"" Ben muttered, squinting through the rain. ""That's an odd logo for a local tour company. Looks pretty corporate."" The group dashed into the lighthouse, laughing as the cold rain soaked them in seconds. The heavy oak door swung shut behind them, and the surprising warmth of a modern central heating system greeted them. ""Wow,"" Jess said, pulling out her phone to film. ""Five-star lighthouse living, guys!"" Ben headed straight up to the observation deck and set up his tripod, eager to capture the dramatic waves crashing against the rocks below. Dr. Grant, his curiosity piqued by the mention of a museum, headed off to explore the basement. Jess was already filming a panoramic sweep of the living quarters, narrating about the ""cozy lighthouse vibes"" for her followers.

David collapsed onto one of the modernized benches, grateful to be out of the storm. ""This place is actually pretty nice,"" Jess said, panning her camera across the renovated interior. ""Look at this, heated floors and modern lighting."" Chloe wandered through the space, taking in the blend of historic charm and contemporary comfort. The original stone walls had been preserved, but everything else felt almost luxurious. It was hard to reconcile this warm, well-appointed space with the ominous warnings they'd received. After a few minutes, she climbed the spiral staircase to join Ben on the observation deck.

The view was breathtaking and terrifying. The storm had intensified, and the sea was a churning mass of grey and white. ""The tide's coming in fast,"" Ben said, not looking up from his camera. He was adjusting his settings, trying to capture the drama of the waves. ""Look at the size of those swells."" Chloe pressed closer to the window, her breath fogging the glass. The waves were noticeably larger now and dangerously close to breaking over the causeway. ""Ben,"" she said, her voice tight. ""Look at the road."" He lowered his camera and followed her gaze. His face went pale. ""You guys!"" Chloe called down the stairs, her voice sharp with alarm.

""Get up here! Now!"" The others rushed up, crowding around the observation window. They watched in horrified silence as a massive wave, far larger than the others, rose up like a grey wall and crashed down onto the narrow strip of land. The causeway vanished completely beneath the churning, frothing water. For a moment, no one spoke. They just stared at the place where the road had been. ""It'll go back down, right?"" Jess asked, her voice small. ""When the wave passes?"" But the water didn't recede. Another wave crashed over the submerged causeway, and then another. The road was gone, swallowed by the sea. Jess was the first to break. ""Oh my God, we're stuck here!"" she cried, her voice rising in panic. ""We're trapped! What are we going to do?"" ""There's no cell service,"" David said, his face grim as he lowered his phone.

""So we can't call for help?"" Ben asked, turning away from the window. ""We're just... stuck here until the storm passes? When will that be?"" ""It could be days!"" Jess wailed, pacing back and forth. ""We don't have any food! We're going to starve!"" ""Everyone, calm down,"" Dr. Grant said, his voice firm but steady. He placed a reassuring hand on Jess's shoulder. ""Panicking will not help. Let's assess the situation logically. We are in a secure, modern building. We have heat and light. We are safe from the storm. The driver knows we are here. As soon as the storm breaks and the tide recedes, they will send help. We are not in any immediate danger."" His calm, authoritative tone had a soothing effect.

Jess stopped pacing, and Ben took a deep breath. ""He's right,"" David said. ""Freaking out isn't going to solve anything."" ""So what do we do?"" Chloe asked, her voice small. ""Just... wait?"" Dr. Grant's eyes twinkled with a hint of his earlier academic excitement. ""We do more than wait,"" he said. ""Think about it. We have this entire historic lighthouse to ourselves. No other tourists, no guides rushing us along. This is a unique opportunity for unabated exploration. Who knows what we might find? Let's treat this not as a crisis, but as an adventure."" The idea of exploring the lighthouse, of turning their predicament into an adventure, was a welcome distraction from their fear. It gave them a way to reclaim some control over their situation.

The main floor housed the keeper's living quarters, which were spartan and tidy. They found a small kitchen, a bedroom with a narrow cot, and a living area with a pot-bellied stove. But it was a heavy, iron door at the back of the living area, marked 'MASKINROM,' that drew their attention. ""Engine room,"" Dr. Grant translated. ""Must lead to the basement."" The door was unlocked. It opened onto a steep, narrow flight of stone steps, and a wave of cold, damp air, thick with the smell of salt and oil, washed over them.

They descended cautiously, using their phone flashlights to illuminate the way. The basement was a single, large, circular room. In the center, covered by a massive, dusty tarp, was a colossal object. Ben pulled back a corner of the tarp, and his flashlight beam glinted off a thousand facets of glass. It was the old Fresnel lens, a beautiful, intricate beehive of glass and brass, sitting cold and silent in the dark. Against the far wall were several wooden crates and metal filing cabinets, all marked 'ARKIV' - Archive. “This must be the museum the driver had mentioned. Let's see what we've got,"" Dr. Grant said, his voice echoing in the cavernous space as he pried open one of the crates. It was filled with leather-bound logbooks.

For the next hour, they lost themselves in the history of the lighthouse. The logs were mostly mundane - weather observations, records of passing ships, supply requests. But they painted a picture of a lonely, isolated life. They found old newspaper clippings, yellowed and brittle, detailing the lighthouse's construction, the shipwrecks it had prevented, and the lives it had saved. Ben found a series of photographs documenting the lighthouse's construction. One showed a massive metal crate being winched up from a barge onto the rocks below. ""That must be the original lens mechanism,"" Dr. Grant said, pointing to the photo. ""The Fresnel lens. It would have been shipped in a crate like that.

Then, in a dusty filing cabinet, Dr. Grant found a different kind of journal. It was smaller than the official logbooks, bound in worn, black leather. The handwriting was neat, precise. The first entry was dated 1983. He began to read aloud. The first several entries were filled with personal musings, complaints about the cold, and notes about his family back on the mainland. Then, an entry that froze them all. ""'October 12th, 1983,'"" Grant read. ""Worried about my brother, Olav. He took his boat out this morning, and the weather is turning. He's a good fisherman, the best in Kråkvik, but the sea is unforgiving. I lit a candle for him, as Mother always did.'"" ""Olav,"" Chloe whispered.

""The old man on the pier?"" ""His brother was the last keeper!"" Ben realized. ""The one who drowned!"" Grant kept reading. A few pages later, another entry. ""'November 2nd, 1983. A strange delivery today. A large shipping crate, brought by a private barge. The men who delivered it were not locals. They said it was 'specialized equipment' for the lighthouse, part of a new government initiative. But there was no official paperwork. They paid me in cash to keep quiet about it. I don't like it. The crate is down by the salt pools. They said it was too heavy to bring up to the lighthouse.'"" Grant flipped forward a few more pages, finding another entry. ""'November 5th, 1983,'"" he read, his voice barely a whisper. ""'I hear music at night. A beautiful, terrible music. It seems to be coming from the north side of the island, from the direction of the crate. It calls to me. I find myself wanting to go to it. I have to lock myself in at night to keep from walking out into the storm. God help me, what is happening here?'""

The winds of the storm had been whipping the waves larger and larger, and a substantially sized wave managed to take out several power lines for the lighthouse, the lights inside immediately going dark and settling a deathly hush on everyone. Just when Jess was about to say something, a musical note drifted down the stairs. ""What was that?"" Chloe whispered, her eyes wide. Another note floated on the air, seeming to come from all directions at once, masking the storm\`s rage. Chloe moved toward the stairs, and by the time she reached them, a beautiful melody was forming. As she climbed, though, it began to morph into a sinister undertone that made the hair on the back of her neck stand up. Her heart began to race. She felt a compulsion building in her chest, a need to go outside, to find the source of the music.

Her feet moved faster, climbing the stairs toward the door. And then she remembered. The music from the hotel, the wet man, Olav's warning. Piecing it together quickly, she shouted back to everyone, ""COVER YOUR EARS!"" as she slammed her palms hard against the sides of her head, pressing her ears shut. The effect was immediate. The compulsion drained from her body like water from a broken vessel. The tension in her chest released, and she could breathe again. The music was still there, a muffled throb through her palms, but the terrible pull was gone.

""Do it!"" she screamed at the others. ""Cover your ears! Don't listen to it!"" The others followed her lead, a frantic scramble. Ben jammed his fingers into his ears. David pressed his palms flat against his head. Jess tore strips from a nearby curtain, stuffing the fabric into her ears. Dr. Grant found some cotton wadding in a first aid kit and stuffed his ears. As soon as their ears were blocked, the same relief washed over each of them. The compulsion had vanished. They stood there, breathing hard, looking at each other with wide, terrified eyes.

“Våtmannen,” Dr. Grant whispered.

Hours passed. David's fingers, jammed deep into his ears, had gone numb. His shoulders burned with a fire that spread down his spine. Every few minutes, he had to shift his weight from one foot to the other, his legs trembling with the effort of standing still for so long. He tried to lower himself to the floor, thinking that if he could just lie down, rest his arms against the floorboards, he might be able to hold on a little longer, but his exhausted muscles betrayed him. He slipped on the damp floor, and in his attempt to catch himself, he landed on his left index finger, bending it backward at a sickening angle.

The pain was blinding, white-hot. David screamed, a raw sound of agony, and before he could react, the music rushed in. David's face went slack, and A look of blissful, ecstatic wonder replaced the agony in his eyes. ""Oh God,"" Chloe whispered, watching in horror. A slow smile spread across his face. ""I hear it,"" he whispered. ""It's a beautiful dance."" He stood, the pain seemingly done, and began to move, his body swaying to the rhythm of the unseen fiddle.

He danced to the heavy oak door and threw it open, the storm roaring into the room, and then he danced out into the rain and the wind, a silhouette of mad joy against the raging sea. On a rocky point at the edge of the island, the figure of Våtmannen stood, his golden fiddle catching the lightning flashes. He was playing, his fingers moving with impossible speed, his eyes fixed on the approaching dancer. David danced right up to him, his face a mask of pure ecstasy, and reached out, as if to embrace the source of the beautiful music.

Våtmannen stopped playing, and the spell shattered. David blinked. The ecstasy drained from his face, replaced by dawning horror. He looked down at his hands, one still reaching toward the creature, the other with his broken finger jutting out like a twisted branch. The pain hit him again, a white-hot lance of agony that made him gasp and stagger backward. ""No,"" he whispered, his voice hoarse. ""No, what did I—"" He looked around wildly. The storm. The rocks. The sea crashing just feet away. He was outside. How had he gotten outside?

His friends were tiny figures in the doorway of the lighthouse, their faces pale with horror. ""Help!"" he screamed, his voice breaking. ""HELP ME!"" He tried to run, but his legs were weak, his muscles trembling. He took one step, then another, slipping on the wet rocks. His broken finger throbbed with each heartbeat, the pain making him dizzy. Våtmannen watched him with deep, ocean-colored eyes. There was a patient hunger behind them, like a predator stalking its prey.

Then he pounced. He moved with an unnatural speed, his face twisting into a mask of monstrous hunger. He threw himself upon David, clamping his dripping hands over David's face, and began smothering him. David tried to scream, tried to fight, his good hand clawing at the creature's arms, but it was like fighting the ocean itself. One of his swipes caught His broken finger on the creature's coat, and the pain was blinding. His desperate struggle grew weaker, his movements more sluggish as his life was extinguished on the wet, black rocks in the storm.

Våtmannen stood, gripping David's corpse by the ankle and dragged it across the rocks, into the sea with him. Inside the lighthouse, the four remaining members scrambled back from the open doorway, the image of David's suffocation burned into their minds. Jess vomited, her whole body heaving with such force that her legs gave out. Ben caught her before she collapsed, his own hands shaking so badly he could barely hold her up. ""He's gone,"" Chloe whispered, her voice hollow. ""David's gone.""

Dr. Grant, his face ashen, stumbled back from the window. ""My God,"" he whispered, his academic curiosity replaced by raw, visceral horror. ""What are we going to do?"" Jess sobbed, her body wracked with tremors. ""It's going to come back for us!"" ""We have to barricade the door,"" Ben said, his voice taking on a frantic edge. They sprang into action, their panic giving way to a desperate, frenzied energy. They dragged the old keeper's desk, the pot-bellied stove, and the heavy wooden benches over and piled them against the main door. They worked in a frantic, terrified silence; the only sounds were the grunts of exertion and Jess\`s sobs. When they were finished, the living quarters was a fortress. They huddled together in the center of the room.

Every creak of the old lighthouse, every gust of wind, made them jump. Time seemed to stretch as the silent terror gripped the group. Finally, Ben had had enough and spoke up, “We can't just sit here,"" he said, his voice raspy. ""We can't just wait for it to come back."" ""What do you suggest we do, Ben?"" Jess snapped, her voice sharp with grief and anger. ""No, I mean... maybe there is a way to fight it. A way to stop it.""

""Maybe there are more journals,"" Chloe said, her voice barely a whisper. ""Maybe there are other records. Something that tells us more about it, ""We only looked through one crate of logbooks. There were others. And the filing cabinets... we only checked one of them,"" Dr. Grant said. ""So we have to go back down there,"" Ben said. A fresh wave of terror washed over the group. The thought of leaving their fortified living area was almost unbearable. ""We can't split up,"" Jess said, her voice trembling. ""We have to stay together.""

""She's right,"" Chloe agreed. ""We can't risk it."" ""But we can't just sit here and wait to die!"" Ben argued, his voice rising. ""I'll go,"" Dr. Grant said quietly. They all turned to look at him. The professor, shaken by David's death, now seemed to have found a new resolve. ""I'm the one who should go,"" he said. ""I'm a Folklore researcher. I know what to look for. You three search up here. I'll be back as soon as I find something.""

""No,"" Chloe said immediately. ""It's too dangerous."" ""It's more dangerous to do nothing,"" Dr. Grant countered. ""We need information, and the only place we might find one is in those archives."" They argued for several minutes, but Dr. Grant was right; they couldn't just sit there and wait. Reluctantly, Chloe agreed. ""Be careful,"" She said, her voice tight with fear. ""I will, Chloe. You take care of them as well,"" he said. ""I'll be back before you know it."" He entered the stairwell and closed the door behind him.

Down in the basement, Dr. Grant moved with a sense of purpose. The fear was still there, but it was overshadowed by a lifetime of academic curiosity. He was in the presence of something that seemed to be very real, and he needed to be sure of what he was dealing with. He opened another of the ledger crates and began to sift through the logbooks. He found more of the same weather reports and shipping logs, so He moved to the filing cabinets and found them filled with official documents, maintenance records, and correspondence with the government.

He was about to give up when he found a thick, leather-bound ledger tucked away in the back of a drawer. It was mostly filled with dry accounting, fuel costs, supply orders, and maintenance expenses. But as he flipped through the pages, a single, folded piece of paper slipped out from between them. It was a shipping manifest, dated 1982.

His eyes scanned the document. It detailed the delivery of a single, large crate, marked ""HAZARDOUS MATERIALS - BIOLOGICAL."" The shipping company was listed as ""Skarlagen Narr,"" but the logo was a familiar corporate design: a hollow cogwheel with the initials ""SJ"" at its center. ""SJ..."" Dr. Grant mouthed the letters, a flicker of recognition in his mind, the logo had been on the back of the tour bus! He set the manifest down, his mind racing. Someone had shipped some dangerous creature here in the 80s. And whoever had done it was likely tied to the tour company.

He heard a soft rustling sound behind him and turned. In the far corner of the basement, partially hidden behind the old Fresnel lens, a part of the canvas tarp was billowing gently, as if caught in a breeze. Dr. Grant approached and slowly reached out, gripped the edge of the tarp, and, with a sharp breath in, pulled it up, revealing a small hatch door. It was circular and made of heavy iron, with a wheel lock at its center, like on a submarine.

The door was pitted with rust and salt corrosion, but the hinges looked well-oiled. Dr. Grant knelt beside it, his hands trembling. Every instinct screamed at him to leave it alone, to run. But he was a researcher and a man of Discipline. His entire life had been built on the principle of seeking truth, no matter where it led.

His fingers closed around the wheel lock, and he turned.

Nothing happened; the hinges may have been oiled, but the wheel felt rusted solid. He took a deep breath and planted his feet. The wheel resisted at first, grinding against decades of salt and rust, but it finally gave way. He pulled the door open, and a wave of cold, damp air rushed up from below, carrying with it the smell of salt and rot. A ladder with rusted metal rungs descended into the darkness. Grant shone his flashlight down, but the beam didn't make a dent in the Tenebrosity. The obvious choice of closing the hatch and returning upstairs to find a way out of this situation never even crossed his mind. Dr. Michael Grant was, at his core, a man possessed, and now he found himself potentially within arm's reach of real proof of his efforts.

Within seconds, he was on the ladder. The descent felt endless, rung after rung after rung after rung, the air growing colder and damper the deeper underground he travelled. His phone light bounced off the algae-covered stone walls, illuminating the immediate area in sweeping arcs. The roar of the ocean could be heard, but it was muted, as if it were on the other side of a wall. A dim glow began at the perceived bottom of the ladder; it grew a little brighter as he neared the end, and he could make out that the floor was made of wet, flattened rocks.

He stepped off the ladder into a chamber, maybe fifteen feet across, but perfectly circular, carved from the living rock. The walls glittered under his flashlight beam, but the true horror lay in the center of the room. There was a raised stone platform with a man-sized nest made of thick layers of dried kelp and seaweed, but the kelp on the top layer still looked fresh. Across the room from the nest was a hole in the floor. Dr. Grant approached it slowly, his breath misting in the cold air. The hole was perhaps four feet across, and when he shone his light down into it, he could see the black ocean water moving with a slight current from somewhere.

Dr. Grant's mind reeled. This must be Våtmannen\`s lair! He quickly started searching around the room, looking for anything that could help. He moved to the wall and saw something carved into the stone. He moved closer, opening his camera app. It was a runestone, an actual, genuine runestone, fitted directly into the chamber wall. The runes were old but perfectly preserved, as if freshly carved. He took a few pictures, then went back to searching the room, moving to the kelp nest.

As he drew closer to the nest, the odor of rot became much stronger. Dr. Grant struggled not to gag as he stepped up and peeked inside, intending to get a quick look and then run away, but his eyes alighted on a rather large diamond necklace that was poking out of the leaves. He made the split-second decision that he was safe enough, and he snatched the necklace up. But it only moved a few inches before getting stuck on something.

He pulled his shirt up over his nose and breathed in shallow breaths, minimizing the amount of rot he inhaled with each breath. Once he was fully sated, he pulled with more force and felt the necklace dislodge. He increased the torque on his pull, and the tension on the other end of the necklace gave way as the necklace and the neck it was around came flying out of the kelp and seaweed.

Dr. Grant let go of the necklace and leaped backwards, shrieking in terror. He turned and raced back up the ladder, his lust for adventure replaced by his fight or flight response. He still had the presence of mind to hang onto his phone and the document he found in the ledger, though. Once he reached the basement, he quickly closed the hatch and went around searching for something to bar the hatch with. He found an old crowbar that must have been used to open the crates in the photos of the lighthouse's construction, and jammed it into the lock mechanism, sealing the hatch shut.

Having created separation between himself and the threat, Dr. Grant took a moment to steady himself before wobbling over to a chair in the corner of the room. He sat down heavily, his body shivering uncontrollably from the adrenaline, and began to box breathe.

In 2…3…4…Out..2..3..4..Hold…2…3…4…Repeat. Having calmed himself, Dr. Grant pulled out his phone, opened the gallery app, selected the picture of the rune, then took out his notebook and pen.

ᛘᛅᚦᚱ:ᚴᛁᚱᛏᛁ:ᛋᛅᛏ:ᛅᛏ:ᚢᛁᚴ:ᚼᛅᛚᛏᚱ:ᚴᚢᚾᛅᛏᚢ:ᛘᛁᚦᛅᚾ:ᚢᛁᚴ:ᚴᛁᚾᚴᚱ:ᛘᚢᚾ:ᚼᛅᚾ:ᛅᛁᚴᛁ:ᛏᛅᚢᦒ:ᚠᛁᛘ:ᚴᛁᛅᚠᛁᚱ:ᚴᛁᚴᚾ:ᚠᛁᛘ:ᚢᛁᚴᚢᛘ:ᚴᛅᚠᛅ:ᛋᛁᚴᚱ:ᛅᚢᦒᚱ:ᚢᚱᚾ:ᚢᛁᛏ

Halfway through translating the first Galdr, a flash of light burst behind Dr. Grant's eyes, fading just as quickly. He shook his head to clear the sensation and returned to translating, telling himself it was just shock. Not long after, though, he was hit by another flash, but this one came with a vision: Våtmannen, alive and human before a crowd, playing the fiddle. He misses a note, and the crowd rumbles with dissatisfaction, visibly frustrated by his mistake and the audience's reaction. The man strikes another wrong chord, producing a cat-like screech that makes the audience flinch, and some rise and leave.

The vision ended abruptly, leaving Dr. Grant staring at the inscription again. A moment later, he regained his wits, having processed all that he had just witnessed. His first thought was to rush up the stairs and share the experience with the others, but then his rational mind kicked in, and he realized the vision might not be directly linked to the runes he was translating. It was much more likely that his frightening experience in the cave below had amped his adrenaline and anxiety too much, and he had just had a simple mini-stroke.

He continued translating, deciphering the name Byrgir, and was once again blinded by a vision, this time of the man sleeping in a hammock in the forecastle of a ship, his once fine clothes now soiled and torn. A shout from above decks startles him awake, and he leaps out of the sling, landing firmly on his feet. The shout rings out again, and he rushes up the stairs to the top deck. As soon as his head cleared deck level, he heard a whistle and turned, just in time to catch a boot to the face. The force of the impact knocked him out, and his unconscious body crashed to the ground, only to roll slowly down the sloped steps.

Dr. Grant once again came to his senses, though there was no denying it this time, that vision had been a direct result of translating the Galdr. This should have terrified him, but he was in too deep. I can find the answers in these visions, he justified to himself as he continued to translate. Nearly halfway through the engraving, he was struck by a third vision: the man drunk at a tavern, listening to a brilliant musician; after the show, he approaches him and asks how he got so good. The corners of the man's mouth stretch a bit too far as he tells him about the Wishmaster.

The vision flashes forward to the man entering a beaded doorway into a heavily incensed, dimly lit room with a small table and two chairs. A wizened old man appears from a side room and bows, motioning for him to sit. They both sit down at the table, and the old man takes a long look, sizing him up before smiling and extending his hand. “Velkominn, Byrgir”. The man stops for a second, struck that he knew his name, but he quickly recovered, remembering he was here to speak to a mystic.

The two men clasp hands, and for a split second, both men’s eyes glow red. When they unclasped the handshake, the deal was complete, and the man left the tent; no other words were spoken. The vision moves forward in time to show the man playing to a packed crowd, and then later that night. In a hotel room full of drunk women, the man silently smothers one before quietly returning to bed.

Dr. Grant came to his senses again and stared at the runes. Only one Galdr was remaining, but a sudden droplet of blood splashed on the phone screen. He reached up and felt the blood dripping from his nose. He wiped his screen, took a deep breath, and began reading the final Galdr. He expected it, but was still unprepared, as another vision overtook him. Time moved forward in great leaps, and he watched as the man played out a repeating pattern of performance and murder again and again, but the longer he continued, the more he began to change.

It started gradually, with a light greenish hue spreading across his body. After twenty years, his entire body had taken on a mottled green and black appearance; no one wanted to hire a monster to play music at their fancy dinner party. But he still had the compulsion to kill; after so long, it had become a comforting ritual that he could perform when things got a little too much. He used his tainted talent to lure people to the riverside, where he would drown and stab them to death, offering them as his sacrifice to the old man in return for his gift.

Gradually, over centuries, he ceased to be Byrgir the musician and became Våtmannen, the murderous spirit. In a cruel twist, he found he was able to grant certain boons to mortals, but he would only grant them to those who offered him sacrifice. He amassed a cult following of murderous zealots that once terrorized the coasts of Norway before the kingdoms banded together and hunted them to near extinction, making it a crime punishable by death to worship Våtmannen.

Dr. Grant began to hear whispers in the vision, as if something were attempting to speak directly to him: ""I know where she is…."" I can show you… He knew it was a trick, but it was the one trick that he couldn’t afford to ignore. “Show me,” he whispered hollowly. The vision shifted to show the wooded trail where his daughter had disappeared. Dr. Grant felt a cold vise start to close around his heart as the realization set in.

He let out a sudden, gasping sob as his daughter, alive and exactly as he remembered her, came skipping down the path. He tried to call out to her, tried to move, but he was only a spectator in Våtmannens dream. Then there was a flash of movement as something large and green shot out of the woods and snatched her. A Troll, an actual living Troll, held her in his massive hands, sniffing her hair curiously. Dr. Grant's heart began to pound, threatening to explode under the adrenaline coursing through him.

Then, without warning, the Troll opened his maw and shoved her head inside, slamming his jaws shut with a squelching pop, severing her head in a clean bite. Dr. Grant felt his bowels release; the Troll finished chewing and swallowed the mushy goop, raising her body to his mouth again for another bite. He had to watch as the Troll finished her off entirely; only her left shoe remained after it had fallen off during her consumption. By the time it was finished, Dr. Grant\`s mind had broken, reducing him to a sobbing and gibbering mess. His only coherent request was “K-kill mee.”

Våtmannen approached Dr. Grant and took his head in his hands, forcing their eyes to meet. The gaze of Våtmannen was intense, peering directly into Dr. Grant's tormented soul.

Y*ou are ready, Michael Grant…. You belong to me….*

Dr. Grant was powerless and was about to accept his end at this monster's hands when it continued,

*You will serve me…. And I will give her back to you…*

Dr. Grant snapped back to himself, finding the strength deep within himself to speak, “Y-you can do that?” he asked shakily.

*That and much more,* *Michael Grant…. Will you serve me*…

Dr. Grant did not spare a second thought, “Yes. Yes, I will serve you to get my daughter back.”

Both Dr. Grant's and Våtmannen's eyes glowed red briefly, and when he was released, Dr. Grant felt a new sense of purpose,

*Deliver them to me… Before the sun rises… And she will return…*

Våtmannen hissed in his low voice, and then the vision ended. Dr. Grant found he was sitting in the basement, in soiled clothing, still clutching his phone and the note from the ledger. He immediately deleted the photo and tore the note into scraps, which he then ate. He unbarred the hatch door and descended into Våtmannen's lair, stripping his clothes off, he began to wash himself and his underclothes in the seawater below the cave. Once he was finished, he climbed back out of the lair and closed the hatch, leaving it unbarred, and ascended the stairs to rejoin the group.

The others had spent their time roving the base of the lighthouse, checking for any gaps in their barricade while also looking for more information on the mysterious island, and it seemed they were successful as Dr. Grant emerged from the basement to find the group huddled together in the keepers' room. Chloe caught sight of him and hurriedly waved him over, “Dr. Grant, we\`ve found a radio!” she said excitedly. Dr. Grant looked from her to the Ham radio, which had been covered by a cloth sheet previously, and despite the power being out, was powered on with static crackling softly over the speaker.

“Do you know how to use one Doctor?” asked Ben. Dr. Grant smiled inwardly at their ignorance. “No, I'm afraid I don’t, Ben,” he replied in a smooth and sweet tone. “Say, how is that thing still on when the power's out for the rest of the building?” “Probably a backup generator somewhere on the island,” Ben replied as he returned to fiddling with the knobs and buttons, searching for a signal.

“I found Våtmannen's lair, beneath the tower,” Dr. Grant said nonchalantly, “You found What?!” shouted Jess, after the words sunk in, “You mean it lives, Beneath us!” she was shaking now, her anxiety going into overdrive as she imagined the creature sneaking up when they were all asleep and dragging them back down to its lair.

“Yes, but it was empty. Perhaps it has another home or feeding location. I didn’t see David\`s body either.” Dr. Grant stated. “I think we could set a trap to capture or maybe even kill it, but we would have to strike now. While it's away,” He said, laying the foundation of his nefarious plot. A look of uneasiness swept across the group, and they wrestled with the new plan of action. Dr. Grant continued, “There isn’t enough room for all of us, and it wouldn’t make much sense for us all to go down there and get caught unawares. Ben, why don’t you come with me. This is a job best fit for a young strapping lad such as yourself; no need to put the womenfolk in more danger.”

“Dr. Grant, are you ok? Asked Chloe, “You\`re talking weirdly, and it's freaking me out a little.” She finished. Dr. Grant looked at her, his eyes burning with something, “Yes, it's probably just the extreme stress that we are all under, being alone in the basement likely didn’t do me any favors either.” This answer seemed to reassure Chloe as she reluctantly went back to examining the radio. “So Ben, what do you say, shall we trap this monster so we can escape?” Dr. Grant refocused his attention on Ben, who was considering the outcomes.

“Do you really think we can trap it down there, or even kill it?” he asked incredulously. “Without a doubt, Ben, I can guarantee this is the right plan of action.” Dr. Grant said confidently, extending his hand to Ben. Ben took the hand, stood, and together they made their way down to the basement. “It's just over here,” Dr. Grant said as he moved to the hatch door and pulled up the tarp. Gripping the handle, he twisted and pulled, opening the hatch and letting the wave of fetid sea air rush into the room. Ben gagged as the smell hit him and started to turn to run back upstairs when Dr. Grant called out to him. “Come on, Ben, we don’t have time to waste here.”

Ben cursed his shitty luck and moved to the opening, trying to shine his phone light down into the depths. Dr. Grant stealthily moved behind him and gave him a forceful shove, sending him tumbling down into the darkness. Ben landed hard on his left leg, and the resulting Crack! and jolts of pain that tore through his leg told him it was broken. He lay on the ground moaning, trying to reach his leg to look at it. Dr. Grant descended the ladder slowly, taking his time and ensuring he didn’t slip or miss a rung. Stepping down off the ladder into the room again, he took a quick look around and strode over to Ben's prone form. “I'm sorry, Ben, but you have to understand. This is for my daughter,” He said as he bent down and grabbed the foot of Ben's broken leg and began dragging him towards the sea hole. Ben's screams bounced off the smooth walls as each step Dr.Grant took pulled his leg sharply.

“He is going to return her to me, he showed me. I just have to give him what he wants, and I can have her back, you understand, right?” Dr. Grant said, dropping Ben's leg near the hole, his screams continuing to echo inside the lair. Dr. Grant squatted down next to Ben and gently placed his hands on either side of his head, ""You're not worth her life, right, Ben?” He then gripped his ears tightly and began bashing his head against the rock floor. Ben's screams turned into gurgles as blood filled his throat from the savage beating.

Dr. Grant let go of Ben's head and gripped his torso, lifting him up off the floor. He carried him over to the sea hole and dropped him in. The splash of freezing water shocked Ben back to awareness, and he immediately started struggling to stay afloat, his broken leg sending shockwaves of pain through his body each time he kicked. Suddenly, he felt a hand grip his useless foot and forcefully yank him under the surface.

Looking under the hand, Ben saw Våtmannen. He tried to hold his breath, but his panic was overwhelming. He let out a scream, releasing the remainder of his saved air as Våtmannen began to pull him down into the depths. Ben's chest burned, his lungs were starved of oxygen as he thrashed to break free of Våtmannens death grip. Våtmannen continued to drag him down lower, and the edges of his vision began to turn black. Finally, he could resist the urge no longer; he gulped a lungful of water, hoping only to make the end come quickly.

Våtmannen watched as Ben slowly stopped thrashing and became still, slowly bobbing in the underwater current. Våtmannen pulled his body down to his level and began to feast, biting directly into Ben's neck and ripping out chunks of flesh and muscle. The water around them began to mingle with the crimson cloud that billowed out of the gashes. Back in the lair, Dr. Grant inhaled deeply, a look of satisfaction on his face as he felt the Våtmannen feed. He took a few moments to clean himself off again and headed back up the ladder to the basement.

This time, he closed and barred the hatch again, making sure to leave the hatch uncovered as well for any others who might come looking later. He climbed the stairs and slowly exited the basement, adopting a look of horror and grief, prepared to weave a tale of terror to the others. Jess spotted him first and jogged over to greet him, noticing that Ben was not with him. Then she saw his face in better detail, and she knew immediately that something had gone wrong. She dropped to her knees and began to sob, the reality too much for her to bear.

Drawn by Jess\`s cries, Chloe rushed over and saw that only Dr. Grant had returned. Dr. Grant launched into his story, Ben falling off the ladder, going down into the lair, his broken leg, and his screams drawing Våtmannen. “I tried to drag him back up the ladder, but he was too heavy, and then he was on us. It was all I could do to escape myself and seal the hatch from the outside before he got me too.” He finished. His tale had enough reality in it to fool the group, and though they were all saddened by his loss, no one spoke about Ben again.

Hours passed in a state of suspended terror. They huddled together, the silence broken only by the howl of the wind and Jess\`s sobs. The grief felt like a physical weight, pressing down on them, but beneath it was a sharper, colder emotion: Fear.

Jess, unable to sit still, began to pace the room, her arms wrapped around herself. She kept glancing at the barricaded door, as if expecting it to burst open at any moment. It was during one of these restless turns that she heard a voice coming from the door.

""...help me...""

It was a whisper, faint and pained, barely audible over the storm. But she heard it. It was Ben's voice.

""Ben?"" she whispered, her heart leaping into her throat. She rushed to the door, pressing her ear against the cold, heavy oak.

""...so cold..."" the voice said, a little louder now. ""...I can't... I can't feel my leg...""

""Ben!"" she cried, her hands flying to the barricade. ""He's alive! He's outside! We have to let him in!""

Chloe rushed to her side. ""Jess, wait! It could be a trick!""

""Let us in, Jess,"" David's voice said. It was clearer, stronger, but there was something wrong with it. They were like a bad AI vocal clone. ""It's so cold out here. We're so cold.""

""Please, Jess,"" Ben's voice pleaded, ""We're hurt. We need help. Let us in.""

Jess froze, her hands hovering over the barricade. A chilling dread replaced the hope that had surged through her moments before. ""What is that?"" Chloe whispered, her face pale. ""That's not them.""

""Let us in,"" the voices chanted in unison, their tones perfectly synchronized, devoid of any human emotion. ""Let us in. Let us in. Let us in.""

While Jess and Chloe were frozen in terror at the door, Dr. Grant saw his opportunity. He moved to the keeper's room and closed the door. He moved over to the HAM radio and ripped the power cord from the back of the radio. He didn't stop there. He tore the antenna cable from its socket, the thick wire snapping with a sharp crack. The radio, their only hope of rescue, was now a dead, silent box.

Suddenly, a jagged fork of lightning split the sky, illuminating the main window in a brilliant, blinding flash. For a single, heart-stopping second, the storm outside was as bright as day.

He was standing on the jagged rocks just beyond the causeway, the waves crashing around his feet. He was tall and gaunt, his skin the color of a drowned man's flesh, his hair a tangled mess of seaweed and kelp. He was wearing the tattered remains of an old lighthouse keeper's uniform, and in his hands, he held a fiddle that seemed to be carved from gold.

Våtmannen.

As the thunder rolled, he raised the fiddle to his chin and began to play. The music was a haunting, ethereal melody that seemed to weave itself into the very fabric of the storm. It was beautiful and terrible, a song of sorrow and death that promised a cold, silent peace beneath the waves.

""The music!"" Chloe screamed, her hands flying to her ears. ""The earplugs!""

They scrambled for their packs, their hands shaking as they fumbled for the small, waxy plugs. Jess, her eyes wide with terror, shoved them into her ears, the world outside dissolving into a dull, muffled roar. Chloe did the same, her face a mask of grim determination. They burst through the keeper's room door to find Dr. Grant standing over the HAM radio, the frayed ends of the power and antenna cords clutched in his hand. The ruse was over.

""What did you do?!"" Chloe screamed, her voice a mixture of terror and rage.

Dr. Grant's face twisted into a snarl, his eyes burning with a fanatic's zeal, and with a guttural roar, he lunged at them, his body moving with a speed and ferocity that was utterly inhuman. He tackled Jess, sending them both crashing to the floor. Chloe rushed to help, but Dr. Grant, with a savage backhand, knocked her to the stone floor with a sickening crack, and she lay still, her eyes closed. Jess, her heart pounding with adrenaline, fought back with a desperate fury. She clawed at Grant's face, her nails digging into his skin, and jabbed her thumb into his eye, causing him to cry out in a high-pitched shriek that was almost inhuman. As if in response, the storm outside swelled, causing the entire lighthouse to groan under the strain.

Enraged, Grant bared his teeth, a low growl rumbling in his chest. He lunged at Jess's throat, his teeth sinking into the soft flesh of her neck. She screamed, a gurgling, choked sound, as he bit down and worked his jaw with a savage, chewing motion. He tore through muscle and sinew, the coppery taste of her blood filling his mouth, and with a final, brutal rip, he tore a chunk of her throat out, the warm, wet tissue a trophy in his mouth. Jess began to seize, her body convulsing on the floor. Blood spurted from her severed carotid artery, a hot, crimson fountain that sprayed across Grant's face and chest. He watched, his eyes wide and unblinking, as the life drained from her, a savage smile playing on his lips.

Before she was even still, he grabbed her by the hair and dragged her to the main door, her body leaving a bloody smear on the floor behind them. He threw it open, the storm winds howling into the room, and with a final, contemptuous shove, he threw her out into the maelstrom and slammed the door shut, the bolt sliding home with a deafening crack. Outside, Jess lay in a slowly expanding pool of her own blood, her body twitching with the last vestiges of life. Her vision swam, the world fading in and out of focus. Through the driving rain, she saw him approaching, Våtmannen, his movements jerky and unnatural, as if he were teleporting from one spot to the next. The last thing she saw was his waterlogged face leaning over hers, his mouth open to reveal a row of needle-sharp teeth. The world went black.

Inside the lighthouse, Dr. Grant watched through the window, his face illuminated by the flashes of lightning, as the Våtmannen knelt over Jess's body, devoured part of her face, and dragged her limp form into the dark waters. His grisly work done, Grant turned from the window, his blood-soaked face a wide, ecstatic grin. He strode over to Chloe's still form, the last piece of his grand offering, and felt a surge of divine purpose as he lifted her into his arms.

He carried her down into the belly of the lighthouse, descending the winding stairs into the basement museum and then down again, through the hidden hatch, into the sacred grotto. The bioluminescent fungi lighting his path as He gently laid her within the nest-like altar of kelp, as he turned to leave, he realized that she could wake up at any moment. He frantically searched the lair but found nothing. He raced up the ladder and saw that the tarp had some lengths of rope tying it down. Not wanting to waste time, he cut the knots free and used them to bind her wrists and ankles. He then stripped away her outer layers, leaving her underwear untouched. This was not an act of Sexual perversion, but of purification. She had to be presented in her purest form as the final sacrifice.

He fished around in the nest and pulled out a broken piece of bone from his earlier encounter, and used it to slice open his palm. Blood, dark and thick, welled up instantly. He dipped his fingers in and began to paint ancient, sprawling runes on her forehead, chest, stomach, and limbs. Each symbol was a word in a forgotten language, a plea and a promise to the deep one, delivered through him without comprehension.

When he was finished, Chloe’s body was a canvas of his devotion, the crimson symbols stark against her pale skin. He expected Våtmannen to emerge then, to rise from the dark water and claim his prize. But the grotto remained silent, the hole to the sea a placid, black mirror. A flicker of anger crossed Dr. Grant’s face. “I must call him,” Dr. Grant whispered, his voice raspy. “I must have my reward!” He turned and ascended the ladder, leaving Chloe alone in the silent, glowing dark.

The cold was the first thing Chloe felt, a deep, biting chill that seeped into her bones. Her head throbbed with a dull, persistent ache. She opened her eyes, and terror, sharp and absolute, jolted her into full consciousness. She was in the nightmare chamber from Dr. Grant’s stories, bound and half-naked on a bed of seaweed, her skin crawling with the sticky, drying sensation of the blood-runes. She began to thrash, pulling at the ropes with a desperate, animalistic strength. The coarse fibers bit into her wrists, but she barely felt the pain; the thought of escaping overwhelmed her senses.

Her frantic struggles dislodged her from the kelp nest, and she tumbled onto the cold, damp stone floor. She was still bound, but she was out of the altar. Her eyes darted around the cavern, searching for anything, any hope. Her eyes alighted on the broken bone Dr. Grant had used to cut his palm. Scrabbling like an insect, she managed to get her bound hands around it. Awkwardly, painfully, she began to dig and poke at the thick knot binding her wrists. The bone was sharp, and she cut her own skin several times as she worked, but she didn’t stop. The fear of what would happen when the monster came was far worse. Just as she felt the knot begin to loosen, she heard it. A deep, sloshing sound from the hole to the sea. He was coming.

With a final, desperate yank, her hands came free. She didn’t waste a second. She scrambled behind the large, tangled mass of the kelp nest, pressing herself into the shadows just as Våtmannen emerged from the water. Through a small opening in some of the bedding leaves, she watched as Våtmannen stalked to the nest, his gaze fixed on the empty, blood-stained kelp. He saw the ropes and let out A sound of pure, guttural frustration that echoed throughout the chamber, and thrashed its head side to side, searching the room. Finding nothing, he let out a final, enraged snarl and dove back into the black water.

Chloe didn’t dare breathe. She waited, her heart hammering against her ribs, for what felt like an eternity. Finally, she gathered her courage enough and sprinted for the ladder, her bare feet slapping against the wet stone, and scrambled up into the basement. She grabbed the rusty crowbar that Dr. Grant had set aside and quietly closed the iron hatch, ramming it through the handles. She fell onto her knees a moment later, the exhaustion catching up to her as the adrenaline worked its way out of her system.

For the first time since waking up, she allowed herself to feel. A sob escaped her lips, then another, and soon she was weeping, silent but intense, her body shaking with a storm of grief and terror. Her friends were dead. She was alone, and she was being hunted by a monster and the man she had trusted. Her sobbing was cut short by a new sound from above. It was Dr. Grant’s voice, echoing through the lighthouse. “Våtmannen! I have your final offering! "" He was opening doors and windows, his calls growing louder as the storm threatened to swallow his words.

Chloe’s eyes fell on the crowbar. She could take it, try to fight him. But the thought of facing him, of what he had become, filled her with a paralyzing fear. No. The crowbar was better here, keeping the hatch sealed. It was her only protection from the thing in the deep. Taking a deep, shuddering breath, she slowly, cautiously, began to climb the stairs, her mind a blank slate of terror, unsure of what she would do, where she would go. She just knew she had to escape.

Upstairs, in the lantern room at the very peak of the lighthouse, Dr. Grant worked with feverish intensity. He had found the old supplies in the museum: a can of whale oil, wicks, and a flint and steel. The great lamp, a marvel of brass and glass, was merely a decoration now, its light long since replaced by an automated electric beacon. But Grant had restored it.

With trembling hands, he filled the reservoir, threaded the wick, and struck the flint. A spark caught. A small flame flickered to life. He carefully placed the glass chimney over it, and the flame grew, steady and bright. He began to turn the great crank by hand, and the massive Fresnel lens began to rotate. A brilliant, sweeping beam of light illuminated the intensity of the storm.

Chloe reached the main floor, her breath coming in ragged gasps. Her eyes darted to the main doors, thrown wide open by Grant, the storm still raging beyond them. She was planning on making a dash for them when she saw Våtmannen standing on the rocks, his form a dark well of shadow in the bright light. Suddenly, a wild shout echoed from the stairs. ""Chloe?!"" Dr. Grant was caught off guard, but his frenzied rage returned quickly. “YOU WILL NOT FUCK THIS UP FOR ME, CHLOE, YOU ARE NOT WORTH HER LIFE!” He raced down the stairs, his face a mask of fury, his eyes burning with mad intent. Chloe didn't panic. She saw Grant closing in and juked, dodging his clumsy lunge and bolted towards the winding staircase, her only thought to put as much distance as possible between herself and the madman.

She flew up the stairs, her bare feet pounding on the hardwood tread, Grant's insane shouts echoing behind her. She reached the top, the lantern room, and slammed the glass pane door shut, fumbling with the thin iron bolt, sliding it home just as Grant’s body slammed against the other side. He roared, beating on the door with his fists. ""You cannot deny me! Your death will bring my Lilly back to me!"" It was a scene from a nightmare. He began to smash the glass with his fists, rattling the door violently, but soon cracks began to form and splinter out.

Chloe screamed as, with a final crash, Dr. Grant shattered enough of the glass to reach through and slide the bolt open. The door swung inward, and he stepped inside, a menacing silhouette cast by the bright lighthouse beam. ""Chloe, don’t fight this,"" he whispered, his voice dripping with unhinged conviction. ""It's the noble thing to do, Våtmannen needs a final sacrifice, and you\`re all that’s left. Give up, and I'll make it quick, please."" He muttered apologetically to her as he approached her.

Chloe backed away, her eyes darting around frantically. She spotted the can of whale oil and the book of matches, and an idea, desperate and terrible, formed in her mind. Grant lunged. Chloe rammed her shoulder into him, grabbed the oil canister, and splashed its remaining contents all over him. The slick, greasy liquid soaked his clothes. She scrambled past him, out of the small lantern enclosure, fumbling with the matchbook. Her hands were shaking so violently that she could barely strike one.

Grant roared in pain as the fuel got into his eyes. He charged toward where he last saw her, and just as he reached for her, a match flared to life. She thrust it forward into his chest. The effect was instantaneous. Grant erupted in a column of fire, a human torch, his screams of agony piercing. He stumbled backward, flailing, and collapsed into the lantern room, his burning body feeding the ancient lamp. The beacon, already bright, flared with a blinding white light that punched a hole through the storm clouds, momentarily illuminating the distant, sleeping town of Kråkvik.

Chloe slammed the busted door shut and watched in horror as Dr. Grant burned alive, his screams slowly dying as the flames consumed him, but as she stared at the brilliant, sweeping beam of light, a new sound reached her ears, weaving itself into the crackle of the flames.

She turned, levitating in the very center of the beam, seemingly having risen from the ocean, was Våtmannen. He raised the golden fiddle to his chin and began to play. The melody was inside her head, a beautiful, irresistible command. Her earplugs were long gone, she realized, lost in the struggle. Her terror melted away, replaced by a profound, blissful calm. The song was a promise of peace, of an end to the pain and the fear. It was a lullaby for a broken world. In a trance, her movements fluid and graceful, Chloe turned from the fire and began to walk.

She descended the stairs, walked past the bloody mess where Jess had been murdered, and out into the storm. She walked in a dreamlike state past the edge of the rocks and straight into the waves, the cold water a welcoming embrace, until it closed over her head, silencing the world forever. Beneath the lighthouse, in his lair, Våtmannen feasts on Chloe’s lifeless body, taking chunks of her stomach and thighs in single bites.

Julian closed the laptop he had been monitoring the livestream from, satisfied with another successful event. He truly was a master entertainer. He checked his watch and sighed, still four hours to go until he arrives in Italy, and then another 4 hours to the villa. He hated travelling, but it was a necessary evil when you ran an international entertainment empire, and he was a very hands-on style CEO.

Julien considered his options and decided to sleep the remainder of the journey, in his experience, surprise contestants like this next one tended to take a lot out of him.

1q2zlem,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkArchive/comments/1q2zlem/i_woke_up_in_my_local_bar_something_had_already/,I Woke Up in My Local Bar. Something Had Already Claimed the Streets. Pt 1.,"I woke up with my cheek stuck to varnished wood and a mouth that tasted like pennies and stale beer.

For a second I didn’t know where I was. Just the weight of my head, the throb behind my eyes, and a low hum in the floorboards like the building itself was alive.

Then the smell hit. Old fryer oil, spilled whiskey, and that lemon cleaner Marty O’Rourke used like it could scrub sins off a person.

O’Rourke’s Bar.

The place was dim in that early-morning way where the neon signs are still on because nobody bothered to flip them off. The green glow from a beer sign made the dust in the air look sick. My hand slid across the bar top and came back sticky. I stared at my fingers like they belonged to someone else.

“Gross,” a voice said from somewhere near the booths. “Tell me that’s beer.”

I squinted. “Tessa?”

Tessa Dwyer sat up like she’d been assembled wrong. Blonde hair in a knot that looked like it had lost a fight. Mascara smudged under both eyes. She still had last night’s denim jacket on, the one with the little stitched sparrow on the shoulder. She held her phone up. The screen was black.

“Dead,” she said, like that answered everything.

From the far end of the room, by the dartboard, someone groaned like a wounded animal.

“Please tell me,” Caleb Rourke mumbled, “that I did not sleep under the TRIPLE 20 of shame.”

He was half on the floor, half against the wall, directly beneath the cracked dartboard where the “TRIPLE 20” ring was chewed up from years of bad throws. The old cork looked like it had been gnawed by mice. Maybe it had. O’Rourke’s had corners nobody looked into too hard.

Caleb blinked at me, then at Tessa, then at the front of the bar.

His face changed.

The entrance wasn’t just blocked. It was fortified.

Bar stools were wedged into the handles, their legs tangled with tabletops. Two booths had been shoved sideways like someone had tried to build a wall out of vinyl and panic. The pool table had been muscled halfway across the floor, its felt ripped and hanging. Every street-facing window was boarded up from the inside. Not neat plywood squares. Whatever they’d had. Old barn boards, splintered shelves, even what looked like a hollow-core door ripped off a hinge and nailed across glass.

Thin blades of morning light slipped between the boards. Dust floated through them.

Caleb stood and immediately swayed. He grabbed the edge of the bar like it was his best friend.

“Why,” he said slowly, voice going thin, “is the door like that.”

“That wasn’t there when we…” Tessa trailed off, because none of us could really remember when we’d stopped paying attention to anything.

My brain tried to do what it always does in Briar Glen. It tried to make it make sense.

“Maybe Marty had a break-in scare,” I said. “He’s always talking about kids messing with the register.”

Caleb’s eyes flicked to the cash drawer. It was open. Empty.

And that’s when something else hit me—harder than the hangover.

The quiet.

Briar Glen is never truly quiet. Even at five in the morning you get the little stuff. A truck downshifting on Millstone. Somebody’s beater rattling up Holloway. The water tower making that faint hollow ping when the wind hits it just right, like it’s tapping a spoon against a glass. I work part-time at the IGA. I can tell who’s pulling into the lot by sound alone, and I can tell you who’s late by which tires hit the pothole behind the loading dock.

Right now there was none of that. No cars. No birds. No distant radio from somebody’s kitchen window. Just the bar’s stale air and our breathing and those boards holding the morning back like it was dangerous.

Tessa stepped to the boards and peered through a crack. Her face went tight. Not scared yet. More like her brain was rejecting what her eyes were sending.

“Evan,” she whispered, not looking away. “There’s something in the street.”

My mouth went dry. “A person?”

She didn’t answer right away.

Caleb took a step toward her. “Tess.”

She backed away from the crack like it might bite her. “It’s not a person.”

Caleb grabbed the board she’d been looking through and shoved his face near it.

His breath caught. He made a sound I’d never heard him make, a sharp inhale like his body forgot the next step.

He stumbled back so fast he hit a stool and it clattered.

The sound was loud in the quiet bar.

Too loud.

We all froze.

Somewhere outside, not far, something answered.

A low growl, dragged out like a warning.

Then another.

Then the scrape of nails on pavement.

Tessa’s eyes went huge. Caleb whispered, “No.”

The growls got closer. Not just closer. They moved like something circling, testing.

I stepped toward the boards and looked through the crack, because part of me needed to confirm that I wasn’t just hungover and hallucinating in my own hometown bar.

At first I saw Holloway Avenue, empty of cars. A newspaper lay in the gutter, damp and flattened.

Then movement.

It came into view like it had been waiting just out of sight.

It was tall. Taller than any guy in town. The shoulders were wrong, too high and too narrow. Its arms hung long, elbows bent slightly outward, hands low near its knees. Not hands, really. Paws with thick fingers ending in dark claws that tapped pavement when it shifted.

Its head was canine. Not a wolf, not a German shepherd, not anything you could point to and name. The muzzle was too broad. The jaw too heavy. One ear was torn ragged, cartilage pale in the morning light.

The fur wasn’t nice. Patchy. Mangy in places. Dark around the shoulders, lighter along the ribs, like it had been rolling in ash. Its chest expanded as it breathed. I could see it even through the crack.

It sniffed the air.

Then it lifted its head toward the bar’s boarded windows.

Its eyes were pale. Not glowing. Not movie-monster glowing. Just a washed-out yellow-gray that looked like cataracts on a dog that should’ve been put down years ago.

And it stared right at the sliver of darkness behind the boards.

Right at me.

My whole body went cold, fast.

I backed away so quickly I almost fell.

“That’s not… that’s not a bear,” Caleb said, voice broken, like he was trying to barter with reality.

Tessa’s voice was tight. “There’s more than one.”

A long, slow drag hit the boards, like a nail across a chalkboard.

Then a bump against the barricade.

The stools shuddered.

Caleb’s eyes snapped to the back of the bar. “There’s a back door.”

“Kitchen,” I said automatically. “Then the alley. Bracken Street is behind here.”

Tessa grabbed my arm hard. Her fingers were cold. “You said the creek trail entrance is six minutes if you cut down Bracken.”

“Fast walk,” I corrected, and hated how normal it sounded.

We moved, all three of us at once, like the same thought hit our brains.

Get away from the front.

We hurried behind the bar, slipping on spilled beer and broken glass. The kitchen hallway smelled like dishwater and old onions, the kind of smell that sticks in your hair. The back door was there, painted white once and now yellowed, with a metal push bar.

And it had a chain across it.

Thick chain. Padlocked.

Caleb rattled it, panic rising. “Come on. Come on.”

Tessa yanked open a junk drawer, dumped it on the counter. Screwdrivers. Pliers. A hammer.

I grabbed the hammer and the pliers without thinking.

On the freezer door, a piece of cardboard was taped up, scrawled in black marker.

DO NOT OPEN THE FRONT

DO NOT MAKE NOISE

WAIT FOR MORNING

IF YOU HEAR THEM, STAY LOW

And underneath, smaller, like whoever wrote it was tired:

SORRY KIDS

Caleb stared at it until his eyes went wet. “Uncle Marty.”

Tessa’s voice went thin. “Morning’s here.”

As if the universe wanted to underline that, there came a heavy thud from the front of the bar. The barricade shifted. Something slammed into it hard enough that a table leg snapped and skittered across the floor.

Then another sound replaced the growls, closer than it should be.

Sniffing.

From the back door.

We all looked at each other.

Caleb’s face went white. “No.”

The sniffing became a slow inhale and exhale, like something taking its time.

The chain rattled gently, like fingers testing it.

Then a low rumble, deep enough to vibrate in my teeth.

Tessa whispered, “They’re behind us too.”

Caleb crouched, peered through the small gap under the board on the back door window. The flashlight was still dead, so we used the thin light leaking in.

Fog bloomed in that gap from something breathing on the other side.

A claw scratched once at the metal.

The squeal made my skin crawl.

“Basement,” I said, because saying anything else meant standing here until the door gave. “O’Rourke’s has a cellar for kegs. Maybe there’s a second exit.”

We shoved beer cases aside and found the cellar door. It opened with a soft sigh like it hadn’t been used in a while.

We went down.

The air got colder, damp, smelling of mold and spilled hops. Caleb used his phone screen for light until it faded to nothing. The cellar was bigger than I remembered. O’Rourke’s had been renovated and patched and expanded over the years. Cheap and quick.

Along the back wall, behind a rolling rack of empties, a narrow corridor led to a metal door.

Not a normal door. Heavy. Industrial.

A keypad sat beside it.

Caleb swept his dead phone screen across it like that could help. “That was not here when I was a kid.”

A crash from upstairs. Then a growl rolling down the stairwell.

Tessa breathed, “They’re inside.”

The keypad lit when I touched it.

ENTER CODE

My eyes dropped to the concrete beside the door, low near the floor. Numbers scratched into it, carved deep like someone didn’t trust ink.

3 1 9 7

My brain jumped to Glen Days without asking permission. The first year the boot drive total broke three thousand, Marty had stood at Main and Holloway with a grin and a cup of bad coffee and kept saying it was a good sign. I was a kid, but I remembered him repeating the number like it mattered.

I entered 3-1-9-7.

The keypad beeped.

A heavy click sounded inside the door.

The latch released.

I pulled the door open.

Cold air rushed out, carrying a smell that didn’t belong in a bar cellar. Clean concrete. Dust. Something electrical.

A narrow passageway stretched away, lit by faint red emergency lights. It sloped down and then leveled out, like it ran under the town.

Behind us, upstairs, a scream tore through the bar. Not a human scream. Something harsh and tearing.

The metal door behind us hit with a slam. It bowed inward slightly.

Caleb’s voice cracked. “Where does this go.”

I listened. Not to him. To the town. To the silence above.

“We keep moving,” I said. “We find where this comes out. We don’t go back up.”

The corridor split ahead.

Left: MAIN ST.

Right: MILLSTONE ACCESS.

Straight ahead, no markings.

Tessa stared at the arrows, breathing fast. “If we go under Main, we can cut toward Holloway.”

“Holloway gets us to the IGA,” I said. “Food, water, flashlights, first aid. Office has a battery radio.”

Caleb swallowed. “You’re pitching the grocery store right now.”

“I’m pitching not dying in my own town’s bar.”

Behind us, the metal door groaned again.

We went toward MAIN ST.

The tunnel narrowed. The air got colder and wetter. Pipes ran along the ceiling, insulation peeling and hanging in strips. Our footsteps sounded wrong. Too loud. Too human.

We passed a maintenance alcove with a folding chair tipped over like someone had gotten up fast. A coffee cup lay shattered, brown stain dried into the concrete.

A scratch sound drifted down the corridor.

Scratch.

Pause.

Scratch.

Caleb whispered, “Tell me that’s a rat.”

Tessa didn’t whisper. She breathed it like it hurt. “That’s not a rat.”

We killed our light, relied on the red emergency blink.

A bend ahead.

The scratch came again, closer.

Then a soft thump.

Then breathing.

Not ours.

We pressed into a shallow recess beside a blue valve wheel. My shoulder scraped concrete. Tessa’s nails dug into my sleeve and stayed there. Caleb’s jaw was clenched so tight I heard his teeth click once.

It came around the bend.

In the red blink, it appeared in pieces. A shoulder first. Then an arm. Then the curve of a head that shouldn’t fit in a place like this.

Bigger than the one outside. Or maybe the tunnel made it feel bigger. It was all wrong angles and weight.

Its fur was darker down here, matted with damp. Ribs showed through in places. It walked with an uneven rhythm, like it could move upright but didn’t do it the way we did. One footfall had a slap to it. The other had a scrape, claws catching the concrete.

It stopped in the middle of the corridor.

Lifted its head.

Sniffed.

Slow, deliberate, like it was tasting the tunnel.

Then it drifted toward us.

Not rushing. Not prowling like something trained to scare. Moving like a hungry thing that has learned patience.

It stopped a few feet from the alcove.

In the blink of red light, its pale eyes flashed dull yellow-gray.

It lowered its head.

Its breath rolled into our space, warm and sour. Wet fur. Old meat left too long.

Tessa’s breath hitched once.

The dogman’s ears twitched.

It turned its head sharply toward the alcove, like that tiny sound was a flare.

It stepped closer.

Caleb tensed beside me, ready to do something stupid and brave. I grabbed his wrist hard and shook my head once.

My eyes caught on the blue valve wheel.

I slid my hand down the wall, fingers closing around cold metal.

The dogman leaned in.

I could see its whiskers twitching.

Its lips lifted slightly, not a full snarl, something worse. Anticipation.

I turned the wheel.

It squealed, loud and metallic.

The dogman flinched, head snapping toward the sound.

I turned harder.

The valve gave with a gritty jerk. Then the pipe behind the wall released pressure with a violent hiss, like a giant snake waking up angry. Air or steam blasted out through a seam, screaming down the corridor and bouncing off concrete.

The dogman recoiled, startled. It snapped at the air like it wanted to bite the sound.

“Move,” I breathed at Caleb and Tessa. “Now.”

We slid out while it was focused on the hissing, bodies low, feet careful. The dogman turned its head, confused.

Then it saw motion.

Its body tightened.

We ran.

Not a sprint. Not loud. The fastest we could move without stomping.

The dogman launched after us, claws skittering and catching, growl vibrating through the tunnel like a bass note.

Ahead, a fork.

Left: HOLLOWAY RUN.

Right: MAIN ST. SERVICE.

“Holloway,” I gasped. “IGA.”

We cut left.

The dogman hit the junction behind us, skidded, chose our path without hesitation.

The tunnel sloped upward now. The smell changed slightly, more earthy, like creek mud. Grates in the floor every so often. Storm access.

A metal ladder bolted to the wall came into view, leading up to a circular hatch.

“Ladder,” I said.

Caleb climbed first, hands slipping once. Tessa went next, boots scraping rungs. I went last, my palms sweating so bad I nearly lost the hammer.

The hatch had a rotating latch. Caleb fumbled it, got it.

Below, the dogman slammed into the ladder base. The whole thing shuddered. My teeth clicked together.

Tessa made a short involuntary sound and clamped her hand over her mouth.

The dogman snapped upward, jaws clacking inches below my boots. One long hand reached, claws scraping metal.

The hatch opened.

Cold air poured down, fresher, carrying asphalt and winter.

“Up,” Caleb snapped.

I shoved through and rolled onto rough ground.

Caleb grabbed my jacket and yanked me fully out.

Gray morning. Low clouds. The sky the color of dirty dishwater.

We were in a strip of brush and cracked pavement behind the Briar Glen IGA loading area. Beige back wall stained from years of deliveries. Dumpsters in their usual spot. The chain-link gate half open like someone pushed through fast.

The IGA sign was visible around the corner, red letters dull in the morning light.

Caleb slammed the hatch down as the dogman’s head surged into view. For half a second I saw its eyes at the opening, its muzzle pushing up, lips curled back in a silent snarl.

Then the hatch clanged shut.

Caleb dropped his weight on it and twisted the latch.

The metal bucked under him. It hit from below, hard enough to jolt the ground.

The latch held.

For now.

We didn’t stay.

We ran along the back of the store, staying low, using dumpsters and pallets as cover. The town was too quiet. No delivery truck. No employee cars. No morning anything. The two-tone water tower rose over rooftops with BRIAR GLEN in peeling white letters, watching like it always did. It didn’t feel like home anymore. It felt like a marker on a map you can’t leave.

“How do we get inside,” Tessa whispered.

“Front doors are glass,” I said. “Bad idea. Back employee entrance by the dock.”

We reached it.

The metal employee door wasn’t locked. The handle turned like someone forgot. Or like someone left it that way.

We slipped into the back hallway.

The smell hit me so hard it almost made me lightheaded. Cardboard, floor wax, old produce. That faint sweet rot of bananas that are about to go bad.

Normal.

Except the lights were off. Emergency lighting cast weak illumination down the corridor. The store itself was dark beyond the swinging double doors.

Tessa whispered, “Do you hear that.”

At first I didn’t.

Then I did.

A slow scrape from somewhere out in the aisles.

Claws on tile.

Then a low growl, muted by walls, steady like it belonged here.

Caleb’s eyes went wide. “No.”

I held up a hand, forcing both of them still.

The scrape came again.

Closer.

I knew every aisle in this place. I knew which tiles squeaked near dairy. I knew the back room camera was fake because the real one had been broken for months and nobody wanted to pay to replace it. I knew where the first aid kit was. Where the office radio sat. Where the pallet jacks were kept. I knew the IGA the way you know your own house.

And something tall and hungry was moving through it like it owned the aisles.

“We don’t run blind,” I whispered. “We don’t make noise. We use what we know. Step where I step.”

Caleb nodded like his neck was stiff.

We slipped through the swinging doors.

The dark swallowed the aisle.

Caleb kept the flashlight off. Tessa’s hand clamped the back of my jacket so hard I could feel her nails through denim.

I placed my feet on the tiles I knew didn’t squeak.

A shape moved at the end of Aisle Two.

It slid between the endcap displays like it was built for narrow spaces. Tall shoulders ducking under a hanging SALE banner. Muzzle turning, nose working.

It caught our scent.

Its head snapped toward us.

The growl that came out of it wasn’t loud.

It was controlled. Certain.

My skin prickled. My throat went tight like I’d swallowed something wrong.

The dogman stepped into the aisle.

Emergency lighting blinked and showed it in pieces. Matted fur. Long arms. Claws tapping once, a small sound that felt huge.

Then the lights dimmed again and it was mostly outline.

It started toward us.

Fast.

I lunged for the endcap and yanked the first thing my hands found, an upright cardboard chip display. It toppled with a crackling avalanche.

The dogman barreled through it like it was smoke.

Tessa gasped. A sharp involuntary sound.

The dogman’s ears twitched.

It surged.

“Run,” I hissed.

We bolted down the aisle, not straight. Zigzagging around stacks of canned soup and paper towels. My shoulder clipped a shelf and cans rattled.

The sound was a dinner bell.

The dogman hit the aisle behind us with that slap-scrape gait, gaining every step.

Caleb whipped around the endcap and almost ate tile. I grabbed his arm and yanked him upright. His skin was clammy. My own hands felt too slick on everything.

Ahead: the back hallway. The employee door. The office at the far end.

We ran for it.

The dogman hit the corner and the air changed. Hot breath behind us. Close enough I felt it.

It lunged.

Wind passed my shoulder.

Tessa screamed, not on purpose, full and terrified, and the sound bounced off shelves and came back twice as loud.

The dogman answered with a roar that shook the aisle signage.

It came again.

I spun and swung the hammer.

Metal met something hard in its face. A crack traveled up my wrist and into my elbow. My fingers went numb for a second.

The dogman recoiled half a step, surprised more than hurt.

Its lips peeled back.

Not a snarl. A decision.

It snapped at my forearm. Teeth grazed my sleeve. Heat. Pressure. A sting like a burn.

I yanked back, stumbled, and my heel caught a pallet edge.

I went down hard.

Tile hit my spine and knocked breath out of me in a grunt I couldn’t stop.

The dogman was on me immediately, shadow filling the aisle. It straddled my legs, paws on either side of my ribs, and lowered its head like it meant to bite my throat clean open.

I saw its eyes up close. Pale, dead-looking, focused.

My mind went blank except for one ugly thought.

This is how people die. On grocery store tile, under emergency lights, in a town nobody outside cares about.

Tessa moved.

She grabbed a glass jar from the shelf, pasta sauce, and smashed it against the side of its head.

The jar burst. Red sauce and glass sprayed.

The dogman snapped sideways and bit at her arm, missing by inches, jaws clacking hard enough I felt it in my teeth.

Caleb dove in and kicked it in the ribs.

It didn’t fall.

It turned on him with a sound like hate.

Caleb froze a half-second too long.

I shoved the hammer up into the underside of its jaw, both hands on the handle. The blow lifted its head and bought me a heartbeat.

I scrambled backward on my elbows, palms burning from friction. My arm felt wet and hot where the teeth had grazed.

“Move,” I rasped at Caleb.

He did, stumbling down the aisle.

The dogman shook its head violently, flinging sauce and spit. It looked offended.

Then it charged again.

I grabbed the nearest cart and shoved it forward like a battering ram.

The cart hit its knees.

It stumbled.

For one heartbeat, the cart pinned its legs.

“Back hall,” I shouted, and my voice sounded wrong, cracked, too loud.

Caleb and Tessa ran.

The dogman ripped the cart aside like it weighed nothing and came after us.

We burst into the back hallway.

The air smelled like cardboard and cleaning chemicals. A weak emergency light flickered above the loading area. The office door was ahead.

Caleb slammed into it, rattled the handle.

Locked.

“It’s locked,” he choked.

Of course it was. Management always locked it. My key ring was on my belt loop.

My hands fumbled like they belonged to somebody else. The metal key teeth scraped the lock twice before I got it in.

The dogman hit the swinging doors behind us.

They slapped open.

It stepped into the hallway, shoulders scraping the frame, claws clicking on concrete.

It lowered its head and started forward, slow now, savoring it.

Tessa backed up until her shoulders hit cinderblock. No room left.

I turned the key. The office door popped open.

“In,” I barked.

Tessa shoved Caleb through.

I followed, half-turned, hammer up.

The dogman lunged.

I slammed the door in its face.

The metal door shook in the frame.

It slammed back harder. The hinges screamed.

Caleb threw his weight against the door, shoulder first, face twisting. “What now.”

The dogman hit again and the whole door flexed.

I scanned the office in a single desperate sweep. Desk. Old computer. Corkboard with schedules. First aid kit. A radio on the shelf. Fire extinguisher mounted by the filing cabinet. A thin beige maintenance door marked EMPLOYEES ONLY.

And the freezer keys on a hook.

I yanked the extinguisher down and shoved it into Tessa’s hands. “If it gets in, blast its eyes.”

Her fingers tightened around it like she wasn’t sure she could lift it.

I grabbed the freezer keys and ripped open the maintenance door.

“Back corridor,” I said. “It leads to the walk-ins.”

Another slam. The office door window spiderwebbed.

A paw punched through, claws slicing air.

Tessa made a sound that wasn’t a word.

“Now,” I snapped.

We spilled into the maintenance corridor, narrow concrete, stale air. The overhead light was out. Only the red emergency glow bled under doors.

Behind us, the office door howled with impacts.

We ran for the walk-in freezer.

The first freezer door was thick white metal with a rubber seal. I jammed the key into the lock, turned it, hauled it open.

Cold hit us like a slap.

We piled inside between stacked boxes of frozen fries and shrink-wrapped meat trays. Our breath turned to clouds immediately. My fingers went numb so fast it felt like pins.

I slammed the freezer door shut.

The world went muffled. The seal swallowed sound.

For one second there was only the hum of the freezer unit and our breathing, ragged and loud in the cold.

Then a crash outside.

The office door gave.

Footfalls. Fast. Heavy.

The dogman was loose.

It hit the maintenance corridor with a snuffling growl, nails scraping, searching.

It moved close enough that I could hear the wet sniffing at the seam.

A claw tapped the freezer door once.

Then again.

Then a slow drag down metal, a sound that made my teeth ache.

The handle rattled.

Tessa’s teeth chattered. “It can’t open this, right.”

The handle jerked harder.

It slammed its shoulder into the door.

The freezer shuddered. Boxes shifted. Frost dust rained down.

It slammed again.

The seal creaked.

Caleb pressed both hands to the door like he could hold it shut by force of will.

I looked around the freezer interior, mind racing. Metal shelving. A pallet jack shoved in the corner. A vent panel near the back, old service access, held on by screws.

Pliers.

I yanked them out and started twisting screws with numb fingers. Each turn felt slow. My hands didn’t want to obey.

Outside, another slam. The door bowed inward a fraction.

Caleb’s voice cracked. “Evan.”

“I’m working,” I grunted.

Tessa crouched beside me and held the panel steady, trembling so hard the metal rattled against the wall.

The last screw dropped into frost with a tiny ping.

I yanked the panel free.

Behind it, a narrow service gap between this freezer and the next. Just big enough to squeeze through sideways.

“One at a time,” I said. “Go.”

Caleb wedged himself in and disappeared, scraping against metal. Tessa followed, extinguisher clutched to her chest like a baby.

The handle outside jerked violently.

The dogman roared, furious.

The latch squealed.

The door began to open.

I shoved into the service gap.

Cold metal scraped my shoulder. Something snagged my sleeve and tore fabric with a sharp rip. My skin stung. I yanked free and dropped into the adjacent freezer with a thud that knocked the air out of me.

Caleb hauled me up by the arm.

This freezer held ice cream and frozen pizzas, tubs of sherbet stacked like bricks. The hum was louder here. My ears rang.

Tessa pressed her ear to the wall, face white.

On the other side, the dogman crashed into boxes, shelves rattling. It had followed our scent into the first freezer.

Its breath came hard and angry.

It found the service gap.

A pale eye appeared at the opening, part of its muzzle, wet black nose filling the space. It snapped at the air, teeth clacking inches from my fingers.

I jerked back.

It shoved harder, trying to force its head through.

It couldn’t fit.

It snarled and rammed its shoulder into the freezer wall. The wall shuddered. The gap widened a hair.

We couldn’t stay.

I looked at the floor in the first freezer through the gap. Frost and meltwater near the drain. Always a puddle there.

Then I looked at the busted wiring behind the freezer panels near the back, the conduit lines and compressor hookups.

Cold, water, metal.

I grabbed a case of bottled water from the corner and shoved it toward the gap.

Caleb blinked. “What are you doing.”

“Making the floor wet,” I said, and my voice sounded flat because fear was chewing the edges off my tone.

I twisted caps off and poured bottles through into the first freezer. Water splashed. Sloshed. Began to turn slick on the cold floor.

The dogman shoved its arm through the gap, long clawed fingers reaching like hooks.

It swiped.

Tessa flinched so hard her shoulder hit a stack of pizza boxes, but she didn’t scream this time. She bit down on it. I saw her jaw tremble.

We needed out.

I spotted the second freezer’s exit door, the one that led back into the store near frozen foods.

“Exit,” I breathed. “We go now.”

Caleb grabbed the handle.

The dogman shoved its arm through again, claws scraping metal, reaching farther.

Tessa fired the extinguisher into the gap on instinct.

White powder blasted into its face.

The dogman choked and recoiled, coughing, furious.

“Go,” I snapped.

Caleb yanked the freezer door open.

We spilled out into the dark store near the frozen foods aisle. The emergency lights flickered, making the glass freezer doors flash like mirrors. The air out here felt warm compared to the freezer, but my skin was still numb, my hands shaking so bad I almost dropped the hammer.

Behind us, the dogman thrashed inside the first freezer, slipping on the wet floor.

It hit the door.

Its claws scraped.

It slipped again. A heavy thud.

A roar turned ragged, strangled.

The first freezer door began to pull shut on its own, the cold keeping mechanism doing what it was built to do. The handle clacked.

Click.

The latch caught.

The dogman slammed the door from inside.

Metal rang. It roared again, and it sounded trapped.

We didn’t stop moving.

We ran past the deli counter, past holiday tinsel that still hung in thin sad strands, past the pharmacy aisle, past the endcap that still had a “WINTER SAVINGS” sign dangling crooked.

We reached the manager’s desk near the front.

The boarded windows and morning light beyond looked wrong, like someone boarded up the world.

Caleb spun in a tight circle, wild-eyed. “Where do we go.”

I didn’t get to answer.

The first freezer door bucked open.

The dogman came out like a missile, fur caked in white extinguisher dust, muzzle wet, lips pulled back.

It hit the tile and skated.

It tried to correct.

It went down hard, full body slam that shook shelves.

It scrambled to rise, claws slipping on the slick patch.

I saw the pallet jack near the stock room entrance, left out for morning deliveries. Its handle stood up like a hook.

Caleb looked at it, then at me.

No talking.

He sprinted and grabbed the handle, yanked.

The pallet jack rattled into motion, wheels squealing. The squeal made my stomach drop, but it was too late to care.

The dogman got one foot under it and started to push up.

I ran straight at it with the hammer raised, and every instinct screamed this was how I died.

It lunged even from the floor, jaws snapping.

I swung.

The hammer connected with its snout again. Bone and teeth and a wet crack. It yelped, an ugly animal sound, then snapped at my leg. Teeth grazed denim and caught skin. A sting. Heat. I nearly screamed and didn’t. I don’t know how. My throat made a small broken sound instead.

Caleb drove the pallet jack forward.

The metal forks hit the dogman’s torso.

It tried to twist away.

Its claws scrabbled for purchase and found only wet tile.

Caleb shoved again, face contorted, shoulders burning.

The dogman slid backward toward the row of glass freezer doors.

It hit them.

Glass boomed.

Not shattered yet, but stressed.

The dogman roared and tried to climb over the forks, blinded by powder, furious.

Tessa ran in from the side, still clutching the extinguisher, tears cutting lines through white dust on her cheeks.

She blasted again, directly into its face.

The dogman gagged and shook, snapping at nothing.

Caleb shoved.

The pallet jack drove it sideways into the freezer doors again.

This time the glass gave.

It didn’t explode outward cleanly. It fractured thickly and fell inward in heavy chunks, collapsing into the freezer bay.

The dogman went with it, half its body plunging into broken panels.

Behind the panels, exposed wiring sparked, tiny blue-white flashes.

The dogman thrashed. Its wet fur smeared across metal and wiring.

A sharp pop snapped through the air.

The emergency lights flickered and went bright for half a second.

The dogman convulsed.

Its roar cut off into a choked, involuntary sound.

Its limbs jerked, violent and wrong.

The smell hit. Burnt hair, sharp and awful, mixed with freezer frost.

Caleb stumbled back, panting like he’d been underwater.

Tessa froze, extinguisher hanging from her hands like it weighed a hundred pounds.

The dogman’s body kept spasming for a moment, then slowed.

One last shudder.

Then still.

The store went quiet except for the hum of the freezers and our breathing.

I didn’t move for a long beat. My hands shook so hard the hammer nearly slipped. My vision tunneled and the edges of the world felt too bright, like the emergency lights were drilling into my skull.

Caleb spoke first, voice broken. “Is it… is it—”

I stepped closer, hammer up, because I didn’t trust anything anymore. I watched its chest.

Nothing.

No rise. No twitch.

Its pale eyes stared at nothing.

It was dead.

Tessa slid down an endcap and sat hard on the floor like her legs had given up. She pressed her palm to her mouth and tried to keep from sobbing loud.

Caleb bent over, hands on his knees, staring at the broken freezer bay like he couldn’t understand what we’d just done.

I backed away from the body and went to the manager’s desk. The battery radio was there, old and taped, labeled KEEP CHARGED.

My fingers were numb and clumsy, but I flicked it on.

Static.

I turned the dial.

More static.

Then a faint voice, distant and warbled like it was coming through bad weather.

“…stay indoors… do not…” the voice crackled, “…if you hear—”

It cut back to static.

My stomach dropped anyway.

That meant there were people out there trying to warn someone.

Which meant this wasn’t just one creature in one building.

I looked at Caleb and Tessa. Both coated in powder. Both shaking. Both alive.

My arm burned where teeth had grazed. My leg burned where it caught skin. The pain was real and grounding, which is a sick thing to appreciate, but I did.

“We’re not staying out in the open,” I said, keeping my voice low. “We barricade the back corridor. We get the office first aid. We find anything we can use. Then we figure out where the hell everyone is.”

Caleb nodded, eyes red. “Okay.”

Tessa wiped her face with the back of her hand, leaving a streak of white across her cheek, and nodded too. Small. Fierce. Terrified.

I glanced once more at the broken freezer bay and the dogman’s body half inside it, fur dusted like snow.

Then I turned away before my brain could make it fully real and break me in half.

# TWO MILES ABOVE HELL

The air screamed.

At ten thousand feet above the black forests of Washington State, the rear stairway of Northwest Orient Flight 305 hung open like a broken jaw… metal steps leading down into absolute nothingness.

Rain slashed sideways through the gap. Each droplet hits like a needle at a hundred and fifty miles per hour. The temperature outside was seven degrees below zero Celsius... but it felt like forty below. **Cold enough to freeze exposed skin in minutes**... **cold enough to kill.**

Inside the dim cabin, a man stood at the edge of that opening, one hand gripping the railing, the other clutching a canvas bag tied around his waist. Twenty pounds of cash.... ten thousand twenty-dollar bills... two hundred thousand dollars... **enough money in 1971 to buy three houses in the suburbs, ten brand-new Cadillacs, or a lifetime of freedom if you could just survive the next three minutes.**

He wore a business suit.... a white shirt, a thin black tie, and brown loafers with no laces. A raincoat that might keep drizzle off during a walk to your car… but would do absolutely nothing against what waited below... dense forest, trees reaching two hundred feet high. **Their branches are thick enough to impale a falling man, rivers are swollen with November rain, and temperatures that would give you hypothermia in an hour even if you landed safely.**

On his back, there is a military parachute that could not be steered, that would open automatically whether he was ready or not, that would lower him toward whatever darkness lay below at a fixed rate with no possibility of adjustment....no chance to avoid trees or rocks or water.... no opportunity to choose where he landed beyond the general area where he chose to jump.

He took a breath... the air tasted thin.

**Below him**... two miles of freezing rain and darkness between his feet and the forest floor. **Behind him**... an empty aircraft cabin, the crew locked in the cockpit, nobody watching, nobody knowing what he was thinking in this final moment. *Ahead of him.... either the greatest escape in American criminal history or a lonely death in the wilderness where his body would rot undiscovered until hunters stumbled across his bones years later.*

***He looked down into the void one last time.... and then he let go.***

*But to understand how a man ends up stepping out of an airplane with two hundred thousand dollars in stolen cash strapped to his body, we need to go back. Back to the beginning... back to a gray November afternoon when everything was still ordinary, when he was just another businessman in a dark suit walking through an airport, and nobody... not the ticket agent... not the passengers, not even the FBI agents who would spend the next fifty years hunting him...* ***had any idea what was about to happen.*** *Let’s discuss the crime in Part 1. The hunt in part 2....* *and in part 3, the real mystery.* ***Then in part 4, let’s try to explore if we have any twists that popular media, including Netflix series doesn’t talk about.***

***Just like D. B. Cooper, we’re about to jump into the unknown…no map and no guarantees of what lies below. This is a deep dive into dark corners, unanswered questions, and uncomfortable possibilities.***

***Grab some popcorn… we are about to step in.*** 

# THE ORDINARY MAN

**Portland International Airport**  
**November 24, 1971 - 2:35 PM**

The terminal smelled like cigarette smoke and jet fuel.

It was the day before Thanksgiving... that strange dead zone in American life when half the country is already traveling, and the other half is home preparing turkey and cranberry sauce. The airport was busy but not packed. Families with small children…. college students heading home, businessmen in suits carrying briefcases, their faces showing that particular exhaustion that comes from too many flights, too many nights away from home.

One of those businessmen approached the Northwest Orient Airlines ticket counter at 2:35 PM.

The woman behind the counter... her name was Janet, though nobody would remember that detail later... looked up and smiled the automatic smile of someone who had already processed a hundred travellers that day and had a hundred more to go.

*""Good afternoon, sir. Where are you headed?""*

*""Seattle,""* the man said. His voice was calm, unremarkable. No accent she could place. Just standard American English, the kind you would hear anywhere from Ohio to California.

*""Round trip or one-way?""*

*""One-way.""*

She typed into her reservation system... one of those clunky 1970s computers with green phosphor screens that took five seconds to process each keystroke.

*""That'll be twenty dollars. Cash or check?""*

*""Cash.""*

He pulled out a worn leather wallet and counted out a twenty-dollar bill. His fingers, Janet noticed later when FBI agents questioned her, were slightly yellowed... the stain of a heavy smoker. His nails were clean and trimmed…. not manual labour hands, office hands. The hands of someone who pushed paper for a living.

*""Name for the reservation?""*

*""Dan Cooper.""*

She wrote it down without a second thought. Dan Cooper… as common as John Smith…. as forgettable as any name could be.

Before she handed him the ticket, the man asked one more question... a question that seemed innocent at the time but would later become crucial evidence that this was not impulse, was not desperation … or some last-minute breakdown. This was planned.

*""Is this flight a Boeing 727?""*

Janet paused. That was an odd question. Most passengers didn't care what type of aircraft they were flying on. They cared about departure time, arrival time, and whether the flight served food. They didn't ask about specific aircraft models unless they were aviation enthusiasts or nervous fliers with strong preferences about which planes they considered safe.

*""Yes, sir. It's a 727. Why do you ask?""*

*""Just curious,""* the man said, taking his ticket. *""Thank you.""*

He walked away toward the gate, and Janet turned to her next customer, already forgetting the man's face, already moving on to the next transaction in an endless day of transactions.

But that question... *Is this flight a Boeing 727?*... would haunt investigators for decades.

Because the Boeing 727 had something no other commercial jet aircraft possessed… a rear airstair. A built-in stairway at the back of the fuselage that could be lowered to let passengers board directly from the tarmac. It was designed for operations at small airports without jetways…meant to be used on the ground.

But technically... and dangerously, against all regulations and common sense... it could be deployed in flight.

**The man who called himself Dan Cooper knew this. Which meant he had done his homework.**

**Gate 14 - 2:50 PM**

The boarding area was half-empty. Flight 305 to Seattle was not a popular run on Thanksgiving Eve. Most people who needed to be in Seattle were already there. The Boeing 727 sat on the tarmac outside the terminal window, its distinctive T-tail visible against the gray November sky.

Cooper... we'll call him that now, since we may never know his real name... sat in a moulded plastic chair near the gate, watching other passengers without seeming to watch them. An elderly couple arguing quietly about whether they had remembered to turn off the stove…. a young woman in a college sweatshirt reading a thick textbook…. a family with three small children, the parents already looking exhausted before the flight had even boarded.

Nobody looked at Cooper. Nobody would remember seeing him in the gate area. He was, in every possible way, invisible... which was exactly what he needed to be.

He carried two items: a black attaché case and a brown paper bag.

The attaché case looked like standard business equipment... the kind of slim briefcase that salesmen carried to hold contracts and expense reports. Nothing unusual. In 1971, before X-ray machines and metal detectors became standard at airports, nobody questioned what passengers brought aboard. You could walk onto a plane with almost anything.

The brown paper bag was less typical but not strange enough to draw attention. Maybe it contained lunch. Maybe a bottle he had purchased as a gift… or some personal items he didn't want to check.

In 1971, nobody thought to ask.

At 2:50 PM, the gate agent announced boarding for Flight 305. Cooper stood, collected his belongings, and walked down the jetway with the other passengers. He handed his ticket to the flight attendant at the aircraft door... a young woman named Florence Schaffner who smiled and said, *""Welcome aboard, enjoy your flight""*... and stepped into the cabin.

The Boeing 727's interior smelled like recycled air and the lingering odour of the previous flight's meal service. Cooper walked down the aisle past the first-class section... six rows of wider seats with more legroom, reserved for executives and wealthy travellers... and continued into coach, where the seats were narrower and packed closer together.

His assigned seat was 18-E. Last row…. aisle seat on the right side.

He sat down, placed his attaché case on his lap, tucked the paper bag under the seat in front of him, and fastened his seatbelt.

Around him, other passengers settled in. The elderly couple took seats in row 12. The college student sat near the front with her textbook. The family with three children scattered across row 8, the parents already negotiating which child would sit next to which parent.

Nobody sat next to Cooper… in 18-D or 18-F. The last row was empty except for him.

**And that was perfect.**

At 2:55 PM, the aircraft door closed with a hydraulic hiss. The jetway pulled back…. the captain's voice came over the intercom:

*""Good afternoon. This is Captain William Scott. We've been cleared for departure. Flight time to Seattle will be approximately thirty minutes. The weather in Seattle is overcast with light rain, and the temperature is forty-two degrees. We'll be cruising at twenty-five thousand feet. Flight attendants, prepare for departure.""*

Florence Schaffner, the flight attendant, walked through the cabin doing her pre-flight safety check. She noticed the man in 18-E only in the most general way: **middle-aged, dark suit, unremarkable. She had seen a thousand men exactly like him.**

She had no idea that in thirty minutes, she'd be sitting next to him, looking at what he claimed was a bomb, listening to demands that would change aviation security forever.

The aircraft reached the runway. The engines roared to full power…. and Northwest Orient Flight 305 lifted into the gray November sky, climbing away from Portland toward Seattle, carrying thirty-seven passengers and six crew members and one man with a plan that nobody suspected.

In the back row, Cooper looked out the window at the clouds and forests below.

And he waited.

# THE NOTE

**Flight 305, Somewhere Over Oregon**  
**3:15 PM - Twenty Minutes After Takeoff**

The seatbelt sign dinged off.

Florence Schaffner unbuckled from the jump seat in the rear galley and stood, smoothing her navy-blue Northwest Orient uniform skirt. She was twenty-three years old, blonde, pretty in the wholesome way that airlines preferred their flight attendants to be in 1971. She had been flying for two years. Long enough to handle drunk passengers, crying babies, and businessmen who got a little too friendly. Short enough that she still found the job exciting most days.

She walked down the aisle toward the man in seat 18-E.

*""Can I get you something to drink, sir?""*

Cooper looked up from the window. His face, Schaffner would later tell FBI investigators, was pleasant but unremarkable. Brown eyes…. olive-toned skin…. dark hair combed back neatly. Maybe forty-five years old, maybe fifty. The kind of face you would forget ten minutes after seeing it.

*""Bourbon and seven,""* he said. *""Please.""*

*""Of course. I'll be right back.""*

She returned three minutes later with a plastic cup containing bourbon and 7-Up over ice. Cooper accepted it with a polite *""Thank you""* and handed her a dollar bill... the drink cost seventy-five cents, and he didn't ask for change.

Schaffner moved on to other passengers. The elderly couple wanted coffee…. the college student wanted nothing…. the family with three children wanted juice boxes and some patience.

By 3:20 PM, Schaffner had finished her service round and returned to the rear galley. She began cleaning up cups and napkins, preparing for the descent into Seattle that would begin in just a few minutes.

Behind her, in seat 18-E, Cooper did something he had probably been planning for weeks.

He pulled out a piece of paper and a pen... a felt-tip pen based on the handwriting analysis that would come later... and began to write. His handwriting was neat, precise, using all capital letters. The kind of handwriting that suggested either habitual practice or deliberate attempt to disguise his natural style.

He wrote carefully. This message had to be perfect…. Clear, unambiguous, threatening enough to be taken seriously but not so violent that it would trigger panic.

When he finished, he folded the note once, then again, creating a small rectangle.

Schaffner walked past his row, heading toward the cockpit to inform the pilots they'd be landing soon.

*""Miss,""* Cooper said quietly.

She turned. He was holding out a folded piece of paper.

*Oh great*, Schaffner thought. *Here we go.*

She had been handed notes before…. usually they contained phone numbers…. sometimes dinner invitations. Once, even a marriage proposal from a drunk passenger in first class. It was annoying but harmless... part of the job. You smiled politely, said thank you, and threw the note away later.

She took the paper without reading it and tucked it into her uniform pocket.

*""Miss,""* Cooper said again, his voice still quiet but with an edge that made Schaffner pause. *""You'd better look at that note.""*

Something in his tone... calm but insistent, polite but urgent... made her stop walking.

*""I have a bomb,""* Cooper added.

The words hung in the air for a moment.

Schaffner's mind stuttered, trying to process what she had just heard. ***A bomb***\*.\* On an aircraft thirty thousand feet above Oregon, with thirty-seven passengers and six crew members.

She pulled the note from her pocket with hands that had suddenly started trembling.

Unfolded it.

Read the neat capital letters:

***MISS... I HAVE A BOMB IN MY BRIEFCASE AND WANT YOU TO SIT BY ME.***

Schaffner looked up at Cooper's face. His expression was serious, steady, completely calm. Not the face of a crazy person or the face of someone having a breakdown. The face of someone who had thought this through and was now executing a plan.

*""Are you serious?""* she whispered.

*""Yes,""* Cooper said simply.

*""Can I... can I see it? The bomb?""*

Cooper placed his black attaché case on his lap and opened it just enough for Schaffner to see inside without making the contents visible to other passengers across the aisle.

What she saw would be described in official FBI reports and testimony dozens of times over the next fifty years:

*Eight red cylindrical objects…. arranged in two rows of four. Connected by wires to what looked like a large battery. The cylinders were about six inches long and an inch in diameter, wrapped in red paper.*

**They looked exactly like dynamite.**

Later... much later... explosives experts would debate whether what Schaffner saw was actually a bomb or just a convincing fake. Real dynamite in 1971 was typically wrapped in tan paper, not red. Red cylinders of that size were more consistent with highway safety flares. The wiring looked crude… the battery looked like something you'd buy at Radio Shack.

But Schaffner was not an explosives expert. She was a twenty-three-year-old flight attendant who had just been shown what appeared to be a bomb by a calm man in a business suit, and in that moment, whether it was real or fake didn't matter. What mattered was that ***she believed it was real***\*\*.\*\*

And Cooper knew she would believe it. Which meant his plan was working.

*""Sit down, please,""* Cooper said, gesturing to the empty seat beside him... 18-D, the middle seat.

Schaffner's training kicked in. In 1971, flight attendants received basic instruction on hijacking response. The wave of Cuban hijackings in the late 1960s had forced airlines to develop protocols. The rules were simple… don't argue, don't fight…. keep everyone calm. Do what the hijacker says; let law enforcement handle it on the ground.

She sat.

Cooper closed the briefcase and set it on his lap again, his hand resting on top of it.

*""What do you want?""* Schaffner asked, keeping her voice low so the passengers in front of them wouldn't hear.

Cooper's answer was clear and measured:

***""I want two hundred thousand dollars in cash. Twenty-dollar bills. In a knapsack. I want four parachutes... two main parachutes and two reserve parachutes. When we land in Seattle, I want a refuelling truck standing by. I want meals for the crew…. and I want all of this ready when we land.""***

He paused, then added the threat that made everything else real:

*""No funny stuff, or I'll do the job.""*

*An* oddly inoffensive way to threaten mass murder. The phrasing suggested a military background, or simply someone uncomfortable about stating violence directly.

Schaffner's thought in her mind .... two hundred thousand dollars…. four parachutes. The parachutes were the strangest part... they meant he planned to jump out of the aircraft. Which meant he had thought this through even further than just getting money. He had an escape plan.

*""I need to tell the captain,""* Schaffner said.

*""Go ahead,""* Cooper said. *""But remember... I'm watching. If I see police when we land, if anyone tries anything, I push this button.""*

He gestured to what might have been a trigger mechanism attached to the battery in his briefcase.

Schaffner stood on shaking legs and walked toward the cockpit. Behind her, Cooper lit a cigarette... Raleigh filter-tipped, a cheap brand... and gazed calmly out the window as if he had just ordered another drink instead of hijacking an aircraft.

In the cockpit, Captain William Scott and First Officer William Rataczak were preparing for their descent into Seattle. The aircraft was already beginning to lose altitude, dropping from twenty-five thousand feet toward the approach path for Sea-Tac Airport.

Schaffner knocked on the cockpit door. Standard procedure required the door to remain unlocked during flight... this was decades before reinforced cockpit doors and strict lockdown protocols became mandatory after 9/11.

*""Come in,""* Captain Scott called.

Schaffner entered and closed the door behind her.

*""Captain, we have a problem.""*

Scott, a veteran pilot with gray hair and the kind of calm that comes from thousands of hours in the cockpit, turned to look at her. He could see she was pale, shaking slightly.

*""What's wrong?""*

*""There's a passenger in 18-E. He handed me a note. He says he has a bomb. He wants two hundred thousand dollars, four parachutes, and a refuelling truck waiting in Seattle. He says if we don't do what he wants, he'll... "" she paused, her voice catching, ""... he'll blow up the plane.""*

For a long moment, the cockpit was silent except for the steady drone of the engines and the crackle of radio communications from Seattle approach control.

Then Captain Scott did what decades of training had prepared him to do: he stayed calm.

*""Does he have a bomb? Did you see it?""*

*""Yes. He opened his briefcase…. It looks like dynamite. Red sticks with wires and a battery.""*

Scott exchanged a glance with Rataczak. This was not their first hijacking... Northwest Orient had been hijacked twice before in 1970, both times by people demanding to be flown to Cuba. But those hijackers had been political, desperate, armed with guns. This was different. This hijacker wanted money and parachutes, which meant he was planning something nobody had ever attempted before.

*""Okay,""* Scott said. *""Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to contact Seattle operations and relay these demands. You're going to go back there and tell him we're cooperating. Keep him calm. Don't argue with him. If he wants a drink, get him a drink. If he wants to talk, talk to him. Your job now is to keep him happy until we land and figure this out.""*

*""Should I tell the other passengers?""*

*""No. Keep this quiet. The last thing we need is panic.""*

Schaffner nodded and left the cockpit.

Scott picked up his radio and transmitted on the company frequency:

*""Northwest operations, this is Flight 305. We have a situation. We have a male passenger claiming to have a bomb. He's demanding two hundred thousand dollars in cash, four parachutes, and refuelling in Seattle. He's threatening to detonate if we don't comply. Request instructions.""*

There was a pause…. then a burst of static…. then a voice from Seattle, suddenly much more alert:

*""Flight 305, confirm you said bomb and ransom demand?""*

*""Affirmative. We have a hijacking in progress.""*

Another pause. Longer this time. Scott could imagine the chaos erupting in the operations centre... supervisors being notified, FBI being called, emergency protocols being initiated.

*""Flight 305, enter a holding pattern over Puget Sound. Do not approach Sea-Tac until further notice. We're assembling his demands. Keep him calm, do whatever he asks.""*

*""Roger that. Entering holding pattern.""*

Scott adjusted the aircraft's heading, banking gently away from the approach path and toward the waters of Puget Sound. Below, the grey waters stretched toward the horizon, dotted with islands and ferry boats and cargo ships, all of them completely unaware that overhead, a commercial airliner had just been hijacked by a man in a business suit who wanted two hundred thousand dollars and four parachutes.

In the rear cabin, Schaffner returned to seat 18-E.

Cooper looked up at her expectantly.

*""The captain is relaying your demands,"" she said quietly. ""We're going into a holding pattern while they assemble everything you asked for.""*

*""Good,""* Cooper said. *""Thank you.""*

His politeness was jarring. *Thank you.* As if she had brought him another drink instead of being forced to facilitate an aircraft hijacking.

*""Can I sit here?""* Schaffner asked, gesturing to the seat beside him.

*""If you'd like.""*

She sat. For the next two hours, as Flight 305 circled endlessly over Puget Sound while authorities on the ground scrambled to assemble the ransom, Florence Schaffner would sit next to the man who called himself Dan Cooper.

**And she would try to understand who he was.**

# THE CONVERSATION

**Flight 305, Circling Over Puget Sound**  
**3:45 PM - 5:30 PM**

Time moves differently when you're trapped in a metal tube with someone who says they have a bomb.

Florence Schaffner sat in seat 18-D, the middle seat, acutely aware of the black attaché case resting on Dan Cooper's lap just inches from her body. Every few minutes, she'd glance at it, expecting it to suddenly beep or click or do whatever bombs do before they explode. But it just sat there, inactive and silent, while Cooper smoked his Raleigh cigarettes and gazed out the window at the clouds.

Below them, Puget Sound stretched grey and endless. The aircraft had been circling for nearly forty minutes now, burning fuel, waiting for word from the ground that the ransom had been assembled. Other passengers were getting restless... the elderly couple kept pressing their call button, asking when they'd land, the family with three children was dealing with increasingly cranky kids who needed to use the bathroom, and the college student had fallen asleep with her textbook open on her lap.

Nobody knew they'd been hijacked. Captain Scott had announced ""minor technical difficulties"" requiring them to circle for a while. Most passengers accepted this with the resigned patience of 1970s air travellers who were used to delays and didn't question them.

But Schaffner knew. And sitting eighteen inches from Cooper, trying to appear calm while her heart hammered in her chest, she made a decision that would later prove invaluable to investigators… **she would talk to him. She would try to understand who this man was, what he wanted, and why he was doing this.**

Because maybe... if she could understand him, she could figure out how to survive this.

*""Can I ask you something?""* she said quietly.

Cooper turned from the window. Up close, she could see details she had missed before… his eyes were brown, but lighter than she had first thought. Almost amber in certain light. His skin had that weathered quality that suggested someone who had spent time outdoors, not just in offices. There were lines around his eyes... crow's feet from smiling, though he was not smiling now.

*""Of course,""* he said. His voice was patient, almost gentle.

*""Do you have a grudge against Northwest Orient?""*

It was a reasonable question. The airline had been plagued by labour disputes recently. Strikes, angry mechanics and pilots. Maybe Cooper was a disgruntled employee, someone who had been fired or passed over for promotion, someone with a specific grievance that had driven him to this desperate act.

But Cooper shook his head slowly.

*""I don't have a grudge against your airline, Miss.""* He paused, took a drag from his cigarette, and exhaled slowly. *""I just have a grudge.""*

The phrasing was odd and deliberate. *I just have a grudge.* Not against a person, a company. Just... a grudge. Against what? Against life? Against the world? Against whatever circumstances had brought him to this moment?

Schaffner wanted to press further, to ask what he meant, but something in his expression told her he wouldn't elaborate. That was all she'd get. So she tried a different angle.

*""Are you nervous?""*

Cooper glanced at her, and for just a moment, something flickered across his face. Not fear, exactly. More like... weariness. As if he were tired of whatever had led him here.

*""Wouldn't you be?""* he said.

*""I think I'd be terrified.""*

*""I am terrified,""* Cooper said quietly. *""But I'm more desperate than terrified…. and desperation has a way of making you brave.""*

There was something almost philosophical in the way he spoke. This was not the language of a street criminal or a desperate junkie. This was someone educated, articulate, someone who had thought deeply about what he was doing and why.

Another flight attendant... Tina Mucklow, younger than Schaffner, darker-haired, nervous... appeared at the end of the aisle. She had been briefed by Captain Scott about the situation and had been instructed to help keep Cooper comfortable and calm. Schaffner waved her over.

*""This is Tina,""* Schaffner said to Cooper. *""She'll be helping me.""*

Cooper nodded politely. *""Nice to meet you, Tina.""*

The surreal normalcy of the exchange was almost funny. *Nice to meet you.* As if they were at a cocktail party instead of a hijacking.

*""Can I get you another drink, sir?""* Mucklow asked, her voice trembling slightly.

*""That would be nice, thank you. Same as before... bourbon and seven.""*

Mucklow hurried away to prepare the drink. When she returned, Cooper accepted it with another polite ""thank you,"" but as he lifted it to his lips, his hand jerked suddenly... nerves, finally breaking through... and he spilled most of the drink down the front of his white shirt.

*""Oh damn,""* he muttered, looking down at the spreading stain.

*""I can get you another one,""* Mucklow offered quickly.

*""No, no. That's all right. I'm fine.""*

He set the half-empty cup down and didn't ask for a replacement. Schaffner filed that detail away… he'd ordered the drink, but he was not really drinking. Maybe he needed to stay sharp, maybe he was already nervous enough without alcohol adding to it. Or maybe he just was not much of a drinker to begin with.

The minutes crawled by…. fifteen minutes…. twenty…. thirty.

Cooper chain-smoked his Raleigh cigarettes, crushing each one out in the armrest ashtray before immediately lighting another. His fingers, Schaffner noticed, were stained yellow-brown from nicotine... not just recent staining, but the deep yellowing that comes from years of heavy smoking. At least a pack a day, probably more. She had seen that staining before on her father, who smoked three packs a day and eventually died of emphysema.

*""How long have you been planning this?""* she asked.

Cooper smiled slightly... the first time she'd seen anything approaching a smile from him.

*""Long enough.""*

*""Weeks? Months?""*

*""Does it matter?""*

*""I guess not.""*

But it didn't matter, Schaffner thought. Because if he had been planning this for months, that meant it was not desperation, it was calculation. It was cold-blooded…. and somehow that made it worse.

At 4:15 PM, the cockpit called back on the intercom. Captain Scott's voice was calm but cautious:

*""Miss Schaffner, can you come forward, please?""*

Schaffner stood. *""I'll be right back,""* she told Cooper.

*""Take your time,""* he said, as if he had all the patience in the world.

In the cockpit, Captain Scott gave her an update:

*""They're assembling the money now. Seattle First National is pulling it together... two hundred thousand in twenties. The FBI is photographing all the serial numbers so they can track them later. They're also getting the parachutes. Should be ready in about an hour, maybe less.""*

*""What about after that?""* Schaffner asked. *""What happens when we land?""*

*""We deliver everything he wants. Then we let the passengers off. After that...""* Scott paused. *""After that, it's up to him. FBI says to cooperate fully. Don't argue, don't resist. Just give him what he wants and let him go.""*

Schaffner understood what Scott was not saying: the FBI would track Cooper afterward. They'd follow the money….  have agents waiting at the airport. They'd let him think he'd won, and then they'd close the trap.

But looking at Cooper's calm face, his careful preparation, his specific demands for four parachutes and a refuelling truck, Schaffner had a sinking feeling that the FBI was underestimating this man.

She returned to her seat.

*""Good news?""* Cooper asked.

*""They're getting everything ready. About an hour.""*

Cooper nodded and looked at his watch... a simple timepiece, nothing expensive or distinctive. *""Good. Thank you for your patience.""*

*Your patience.* As if she had a choice. As if she were choosing to sit here instead of being forced to by a man with a bomb.

But his politeness was genuine, Schaffner realized. He was not being sarcastic or cruel. He actually seemed to regret inconveniencing her. There was something almost gentlemanly about him... an old-fashioned courtesy that felt completely at odds with what he was doing.

*""Can I ask you something else?""* Schaffner said.

*""You can ask. I might not answer.""*

*""Do you have family? Someone waiting for you somewhere?""*

For the first time, Cooper's composure cracked slightly. His jaw tightened. His hand moved to the briefcase on his lap, gripping it just a bit tighter.

*""That's not really relevant, is it?""*

*""I guess not. I just... I'm trying to understand why you're doing this.""*

*""I told you…. I have a grudge.""*

*""Against what?""*

Cooper turned to look directly at her, and in his amber-brown eyes, Schaffner saw something she had not expected. Sadness…. deep, profound sadness that seemed to come from somewhere old and unhealed.

*""Against being powerless,""* he said quietly. *""Against being invisible. Against the feeling that nothing you do matters and nobody cares whether you live or die.""*

The words hung between them.

*""So you're doing this to matter?""* Schaffner asked. *""To be remembered?""*

*""I'm doing this because I don't have any other options left. Whatever comes after...""* He trailed off, gazing out the window again. *""Whatever comes after is just whatever comes after.""*

Last month I had one of those “okay… this card just paid for my trip” moments ✈️

I was on a 6 AM flight after a crazy week, totally exhausted. I figured I’d just sit at the gate half-asleep, but then I remembered — I’d activated my Scapia card benefits that month.

So I walked into the lounge “just to grab a coffee”…
and walked out after:

• hot breakfast
• unlimited coffee
• shower + spa chair massage
• AND a small shopping voucher I wasn’t even expecting 😅

All of this — on a card with zero joining fee.

That was the day I decided Scapia wasn’t just another cashback card. It actually made airports feel… VIP-ish, even on economy tickets.

And here’s why I’m sharing this now:

Scapia is currently running a limited-time referral boost, and it’s honestly the best entry point I’ve seen.

Wanna Apply with these benefits as 👇 DM me now or comment here and I will be happy to assist you

You instantly get:

✨ ₹1,000 Scapia Coins
✈️ ₹1,000 OFF your first flight in your first month
🛋️ Unlimited domestic lounge access (after monthly spend unlock)
💆 Airport dining / shopping / spa privileges

No joining fee. No complicated hoops.
Just hit the spend requirement and the perks unlock next cycle.

Honestly — if you travel at least a couple of times a year, this is one of those “apply now, figure out optimizations later” cards. My first airport visit itself covered the value.

If you’re curious how I’ve been using it for max value (lounges + flights + coins), drop a comment — happy to share what’s worked for me 🙂",0,1767459234.0,IndianCreditCards,2,0.14,False

1q2zili,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1q2zili/about_hypochondria_and_anxiety_issues_i_have/,about hypochondria and anxiety (issues I have),"Hi everyone!I hope everything is well on that side :)



***First of all, I apologize for the length of this text, but it was the most I could write to convey exactly how I feel***



in November, I had an episode where I drank a little more coffee than I am used to. my body naturally reacted (palpitations, involuntary tremors... the body’s natural response), and from that day on, the anxiety I felt never “left my body.”

At first, I was very skeptical about whether or not it was anxiety: I had never felt what it was like to be anxious. 



And that's precisely what has been holding me back ever since: I'm in a dilemma about whether what I'm feeling is anxiety or something serious (or not, but I don't know).

For a week now, I've had a very slight sensation in my head, not even pain, just a slight sensation: **if anyone can relate, please let me know so I don't feel so alone ehehe**.

Some days it's at the front (on my forehead), other days it's in another area, etc. The fact is that since I've been feeling anxious (nov.) and the symptoms have changed location, it's been a feeling of heavy breathing, I've also felt my heart beating noticeably in my chest, and now it's the feeling in my head again…

I've already talked to my doctor about it, and he told me that anxiety can produce symptoms even without any trigger, and that the fact that I'm constantly watching and checking my body increases the possibility of feeling things that don't exist OR that are made up by my mind and associating them with something bad. **I've also had complete blood tests recently (last week) and the results came back perfect, really good.**

Even so, the fact is that I continue to feel small things without any kind of awareness. They appear out of nowhere, last a few hours, sometimes most of the day, and always comes a time of day when they disappear. And sometimes, even when I'm distracted, I continue to feel them.

**But they are always mild sensations, I can never say it's pain.** 



I think that perhaps because they are mild and also because they occasionally change location, the symptoms I have are fabricated by my mind, under the pretext that I have something serious. **As if subconsciously I have this impression, my body responds and reacts, snowballing the situation.** I have also researched the subject and it seems that I may be right.



But I'm always reticent: what if it's not? Why don't the sensations go away? **I never dismiss this idea.**



The fact is that if the coffee incident had never happened, I wouldn't be writing this post. Everything I've felt and experienced has been derived from that day, but I'm not traumatized; in fact, I've gone back to drinking coffee normally.

**Am I a hypochondriac, and was this triggered by what happened to me? Can hypochondria/anxiety (even if I don't feel it) cause real symptoms? How can I know if I don't have something really bad organically? Has anyone else been in this situation?** 



I'm counting on all your input to help me :)

Thank you very much for your time. ",1,1767459167.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

1q2zi0r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q2zi0r,[Experience Review] ANA Delhi to Tokyo (RT) + Domestic leg to Osaka,"Hello everyone! 

I wanted to share a detailed review of my recent experience with **All Nippon Airways (ANA)** on my trip to Japan.

I booked these tickets directly through the ANA website during their **""Hello Blue Sale""**. The total cost was **₹39,740 per person** for economy class including the domestic flights, which is incredible value for a full-service carrier. I also got 10% points back using my **Axis Atlas CC** which i utilised for booking my hotels.

---

#### 1. Delhi (DEL) to Tokyo (HND) - Onward Leg

* **Aircraft:** Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner
* **Duration:** Around 7 Hours
* **Seating:** The configuration was 3-3-3 unlike JAL which has a 2-4-2 configuration for economy. We were very lucky that the seat next to us was empty, so we could stretch out. Despite it being my longest flight ever, the cabin felt nice and the legroom was great.
* **Food:** Honestly, the best Indian food I’ve had on a flight. They served rice with a paneer gravy and rajma, followed by a snack later in the night. The snack was a sandwich and lays which wasn't that good compared to the dinner we had.
* **Connectivity:** They offered **free texting over Wi-Fi**, which allowed me to use WhatsApp throughout the flight. It was my first time experiencing Wi-Fi on an international flight, and it was pretty cool messaging family from 36,000 ft. You couldn't send any photos though. Even Discord was working :D
* **Amenities:** One thing to note is that they did **not** provide an amenity kit (no toothbrush, toothpaste, or eye mask). Only a pillow and blanket were provided.

---

#### 2. Tokyo (HND) to Osaka (ITM) - Domestic Leg

* **Aircraft:** Boeing 767-300ER.
* **Duration:** 1 Hour
* **Food:** Since this was a short flight, we only got drinks and some cookies along with our coffee. 
* **Wi-Fi:** Unlike the international leg, the domestic flight had **completely free Wi-Fi** that allowed full internet browsing, not just texting. The speeds were great too and helped me do a bit of planning for my day ahead.
* **Experience:** The flight was short but very scenic. The views while flying over Japan were beautiful. Unfortunately we didn't get Fuji side seats but looking at the ocean side towns was nice too.

---

#### 3. Tokyo (HND) to Delhi (DEL) - Return Leg

* **Timing:** This was an afternoon flight.
* **Duration:** Around 9 Hours
* **Food:** We were served a full lunch and a snack. The lunch was quite since but the snack was disappointing. They also had a self-service area where you could help yourself to drinks, biscuits, and dry fruit mixes throughout the flight.
* **Seating:** Once again, we lucked out with an empty seat next to us, making the long journey back to Delhi very comfortable. The flight was longer than the onward leg as well.
* **Luggage:** We were carrying a lot of cabin luggage - a small suitcase, a backpack, and couple of shopping bags. Ideally only one personal item and cabin luggage is allowed but they didn't raise any issues, which i guess is a huge perk of flying a full-service airline like ANA.

---

**Final Verdict:** For ₹39k, the service, food quality, and luggage flexibility were top-notch. If you catch their sale, I highly recommend booking with them for your Japan trip. With the free domestic leg, nothing can beat this. ",4,1767459131.0,InternationalTravelIN,0,1.0,False
1q2zhp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1q2zhp5/is_it_possible_to_rebuild_trust_after_repeated/,Is It Possible to Rebuild Trust After Repeated Lies?,"**Hello Reddit,**

I’m here to ask for your opinions and advice on a difficult situation.

A woman (30F) I was in a long-term relationship with left me (32M) and asked me to move out of the apartment we bought together. The breakup happened after she discovered something on my phone that completely broke her trust.

One day after I got home from work, I picked up my phone to show her something. She noticed that I had ads for prostitutes open. I have never physically cheated on her. I used those ads only for masturbation. It’s a fetish I never shared with her and actively hid. When she confronted me, I panicked and lied, saying a colleague had asked me to look something up for him. She didn’t believe me. After several hours of arguing, she broke up with me and asked me to leave.

This situation was made even worse by an earlier breach of trust. Last summer, while we were applying for a mortgage together, I admitted that I had lied about my salary. She believed I earned significantly more than I actually did. From that point on, our relationship slowly deteriorated, and this incident was the final breaking point.

Since the breakup, we’ve met a few times to talk. I still feel that she loves me, but she says she can’t forgive the lying and what she considers cheating. I’ve started therapy and genuinely want to change. I take full responsibility for my actions and understand how deeply I hurt her.

I’m posting here because I want honest advice on whether reconciliation is possible and, if so, how to approach it in a healthy way. I truly love her and don’t want to give up without trying. I’ve written her letters apologizing and expressing my regret, and I’ve told her I’m willing to do whatever it takes to rebuild trust. Despite this, she still doesn’t want to see me. I recently asked her to meet for coffee, and she declined.

My biggest question is this: **How can I show through actions—not just words—that I’m serious about changing, if she doesn’t want contact with me at all?** Is there anything I can do to rebuild trust from this point, or do I need to accept that the damage may be irreversible?

Thank you in advance for any honest feedback or advice.",1,1767459110.0,BreakUps,4,1.0,False

1q2zgqw,https://i.redd.it/vckq3ex6z5bg1.jpeg,Free food and support for the needy this Sunday,"I’m so excited for our very first static outreach session tomorrow 💚
2pm at Buoy Park, right beside Belfast Cathedral.


The past few days have been completely flat out, getting the van organised in the most practical way I possibly can. I’ve also been making up all the different packs we offer so everything can be easily grabbed and restocked before each outreach session.


Clothing is now organised by gender and clothing type. I did try separating by size as well, but in reality it takes far longer to reorganise after a session and needs lots of extra containers. This way should keep things quicker, calmer, and more accessible for everyone.


Shoes are organised by gender and kept paired together, and our warmth packs are made up and grouped by gender too, as closely matched as possible. I’m also bringing extra gloves, scarves, socks and hand warmers, so even if we run out of pre-made warmth packs, people can still receive everything they need (apart from hats and foot warmers).


We also have a few sleeping bags tucked away just in case. SWEP has been activated until Monday due to the extreme weather, which means anyone found sleeping rough should be offered somewhere safe to stay overnight — but we’ll still be there with warmth, food and support regardless.


Almost everything is sorted now. The only things left to go into the van just before we leave are the soup and the hot water canisters.


We’ll be serving homemade soup, along with hot drinks, and I’m popping to Tesco shortly to pick up a few final bits — milk, sugar, bin bags, and hopefully some bread and butter to go alongside the soup. We’ll also have snacks available for people to take with them for later in the day.


Before tomorrow, I also want to say a few thank yous 💚


• Claire — thank you so much for your delivery of hats and socks. Your kindness is helping us keep people warm.
• Sandie — thank you for your monetary donation towards a soup pot and ingredients, as well as warm items and an absolute bumper supply of biscuits. These will definitely go down a treat. It was also lovely catching up with you over coffee this morning.
• Lettie — thank you for donating a soup pot and hot water canister. Your support will help us warm many people in the days ahead.


None of this would be possible without your support.

He stood at the railing, capturing the dramatic cliffs that rose on either side like ancient sentinels, hoping to add a career-making shot of the aurora borealis to his portfolio. The late-September air was crisp, carrying the salt tang of the sea and the faint scent of pine from the forested slopes above.

""It's beautiful, isn't it?"" Chloe Miller, the youngest of the group at twenty-three, appeared beside him, her bright, curious eyes taking in everything. She had organized this trip as a post-graduation adventure, a final taste of freedom before starting her career, and her enthusiasm was infectious.

Ben lowered his camera and smiled at her. ""It’s stunning. The light here is incredible. That golden hour is going to be perfect for the aurora shots tonight."" Behind them, Jessica ""Jess"" Davis, a twenty-nine-year-old travel blogger dressed in stylish, brightly colored outdoor gear, was already filming a selfie video for her half-million followers. ""Hey guys! Just arriving in the most amazing little Norwegian town. The scenery is absolutely epic. Can't wait to show you the Aurora! Don't forget to like and subscribe!"" David Chen, a thirty-eight-year-old software engineer from San Francisco who had the weary look of a man escaping a stressful job, looked up from his tablet with a faint, tired smile. ""She never stops, does she?""

""It's her job,"" Chloe said quietly. ""She has half a million followers. That's got to be a lot of pressure to produce content constantly.""

Dr. Michael Grant, a professor of Scandinavian folklore in his mid-forties, joined them at the railing, his tweed jacket and thoughtful expression marking him as an academic. He had joined the tour specifically to research the area's local legends. ""I must admit, this is even more remote than I anticipated.""

""You really think you'll find something for your research here, Professor?"" Ben asked. ""Oh, I'm sure of it,"" Grant said, his eyes gleaming. ""These isolated communities are treasure troves of folklore. Stories that have been passed down for generations, untouched by the modern world.""

The ferry rounded a final bend in the fjord, and the town of Kråkvik came into view. It was a cluster of colorful wooden buildings, reds, yellows, and whites, clinging to the rocky shore. Fishing boats bobbed in the small harbor, and beyond them, wooden drying racks stood like skeletal fingers against the grey sky, hung with cod splitting in the cold air. As they disembarked, Ben couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched. He turned, scanning the handful of locals who'd gathered at the dock, but they were all occupied with their own business, unloading crates, mending nets, and talking in low voices. Still, the feeling persisted. Their hotel, the Sjøhus Inn, was a converted warehouse overlooking the harbor. The owner, a taciturn woman named Fru Nilsen, checked them in with minimal conversation and handed over three room keys. Chloe and Jess would share a room, Ben and David another, and Dr. Grant had a single. ""The town tour begins at four,"" Fru Nilsen said in heavily accented English. ""Dinner with the group is at seven. Tomorrow, you have the outskirts tour in the morning. The buses to the lighthouse leave tomorrow night at eight, before the tide comes in."" ""Buses?"" Jess asked. ""Plural?""

""There are thirty-two people signed up for the aurora viewing,"" Fru Nilsen explained, “Four buses. You are in the first group."" After settling into their rooms, the group reconvened in the hotel lobby. They had three hours before the town tour began, and Chloe was eager to explore. Kråkvik was a working fishing village, not a tourist destination. The streets were narrow and uneven, the buildings weathered by salt and wind. A small grocery store, a post office, a church with a distinctive steeple, and three pubs made up the town's amenities. But there was a stark beauty to it, a sense of timelessness that Ben found compelling.

They wandered down to the harbor, where the fishing boats creaked against their moorings. The smell of fish was inescapable. Gulls swooped in and fought over scraps, their cries echoing off the water. An old man sat on an overturned crate near the end of the pier, mending a net with gnarled, weathered hands. He was ancient, his face a map of wrinkles, his eyes pale blue and rheumy. He wore a thick wool sweater and rubber boots, and a pipe jutted from the corner of his mouth. As they approached, he looked up and fixed His eyes on Chloe.

""Excuse me,"" Chloe said politely. ""We're visiting for the aurora viewing at the lighthouse."" The old man's hands stilled. His English was broken, heavily accented. ""Storholmen?"" ""Yes,"" Chloe said. ""Is something wrong?"" The old man stood abruptly, his movements surprisingly quick for someone his age. He stepped closer. ""No go,"" the old man said urgently. He grabbed Chloe's arm, his grip surprisingly strong. ""No, go Storholmen. Is... is bad place. farlig."" Stepping to her side, Ben firmly said, ""Sir, please let go of her,"". The old man slowly released his grip on her but didn't step back. His pale eyes were wide, almost wild. ""The drunket,"" he said. ""People go. People no come back. Vannet... takes them."" ""What drownings?"" Dr. Grant asked, suddenly interested. He pulled out a small notebook. The old man's gaze darted to Dr. Grant, then back to Chloe. He seemed to be struggling with the English words.

""The... the musikk. You hear musikk, you no listen. You hear musikk, you run. Is..."" He gestured frantically, searching for the word. ""Is not ekte. Is him."" ""Him?"" Jess prompted gently. ""Våtmannen,"" the old man said, his voice dropping to a whisper. He made a gesture, running his hands down his face and body, as if indicating water dripping. ""He play the Hardingfele"" He mimed playing a stringed instrument. ""A Hardanger Fiddle?"" Dr. Grant translated. ""Ja! Ja!"" The old man nodded vigorously. ""Gyllen Hardingfele. He play, you listen, You drunket. Many people."" David laughed uncomfortably. ""Sounds like an urban legend."" The old man's expression hardened. ""Is not myte. Is real. I see him. femti år ago, I see him. My bror..."" His voice broke. ""My bror hear the musikk. He walk into the sea. I try to stop him, but..."" He shook his head. ""He no hear me. He only hear musikk. He drunket.""

An uncomfortable silence fell over the group. The old man's pain was palpable, whether his story was true or not. ""I'm very sorry about your bror,"" Chloe said softly. The old man grasped her hand in his gently, ""Please. No go Storholmen. Is bad place. Våtmannen, he jaktar there.""

""Olav!"" A sharp voice cut through the air. A younger man strode down the pier toward them. He spoke rapidly in Norwegian to the old man, his tone scolding. The old man argued back, gesturing at the group, but the younger man took his arm and began leading him away. ""I apologize,"" the younger man said in perfect English. ""My father, he... he has dementia. He tells these stories to tourists. Please don't take it seriously."" ""He seemed very sincere,"" Dr. Grant said. The younger man's expression was tight. ""He believes what he says. But it's not real. There are no mysterious drownings. There have been accidents over the years, yes, this is a fishing village, and people drown. But there's no monster."" He forced a smile. ""Enjoy your visit to Kråkvik. The Aurora is beautiful. You'll love it!""

He led the old man away, still speaking in low, urgent Norwegian. The old man looked back, his pale eyes finding Chloe's, and mouthed something she couldn't quite make out. ""Well,"" David said after a moment. ""That was unsettling."" ""Poor man,"" Jess said. ""Losing a brother like that... It's no wonder he's traumatized."" ""But the specificity,"" Dr. Grant murmured, scribbling in his notebook. ""The wet man. The golden fiddle. The music. These are classic elements of Scandinavian water spirit folklore. The Nøkken, specifically.""

""The what?"" Ben asked. ""Nøkken. A Norwegian water spirit. Male, shapeshifting, plays enchanted music to lure victims to drown. There are hundreds of stories about them throughout Scandinavia."" Grant's eyes gleamed with academic interest. ""I wonder if there's a local variant of the legend here."" ""You're not seriously considering this,"" David said. ""Of course, not as a literal truth,"" Grant replied. ""But folklore often has roots in real events. Perhaps there were drownings near the lighthouse, and the locals created a legend to explain them. It's fascinating, really."" Though the afternoon wasn't particularly cold, a shiver ran down Chloe\`s spine. ""Let's head back. The tour starts soon.""

The town tour was led by a cheerful young woman named Signe, who spoke excellent English and seemed determined to present Kråkvik in the best possible light. She showed them the church, the fish processing plant, and the small museum dedicated to the town's fishing heritage. She mentioned nothing about drownings or water spirits. At seven, they gathered with the other tourists, a mix of nationalities, mostly couples and small groups, in the dining room of the Sjøhus Inn. The meal was traditional Norwegian fare: fish soup, roasted cod, boiled potatoes, and lingonberry sauce.

The food was simple but delicious. As they ate, Jess couldn't resist telling the story of the old fisherman for her blog, narrating into her phone. ""So, this ancient guy grabs Chloe's arm and starts going on about a 'wet man' who plays a golden fiddle and drowns people. Proper horror movie stuff, right? What do you guys think? Let me know in the comments!""

Several people at nearby tables turned to listen. Chloe wished Jess would be more discreet. ""A wet man?"" one of the other tourists asked, an American woman in her fifties. ""Is that a cryptid?"" ""More like a water spirit,"" Dr. Grant explained. ""The Nøkken, from Norwegian folklore. They're said to---, "" ""More wine?"" A waiter appeared at their table with almost aggressive speed, interrupting Grant mid-sentence.

He was young, perhaps twenty-five, with the same weathered look as most of the locals. ""Or perhaps dessert? We have cloudberry cream tonight."" ""We're fine for now,"" David said, slightly taken aback by the interruption. ""The fish was excellent,"" Ben added. The waiter nodded curtly and moved away, but Chloe noticed he lingered nearby, close enough to overhear their conversation. When Dr. Grant started to continue the explanation, the waiter reappeared. ""How is your meal?"" he asked, his smile not reaching his eyes. ""Everything to your satisfaction?"" ""Yes, thank you,"" Chloe said. ""Good, good. And you are excited for the lighthouse? The aurora should be spectacular."" ""We're looking forward to it,"" David said curtly, his annoyance at the continued interruptions beginning to show.

The waiter nodded and finally moved away, but the interruption had killed the conversation. Jess shrugged and returned to her meal. But Chloe noticed the waiter watching them from across the room, and she wasn't the only one. Several of the staff seemed unusually attentive to their table. Ben cleared his throat to clear the tension and asked Dr. Grant, “What made you choose a Doctorate in Norwegian Folklore?” Dr. Grant stammered a bit, “a-ah, I love the thrill of chasing a dream, and maybe never catching it. “That\`s. Deep?” replied Ben as Dr. Grant quietly got up and left the room.

Chloe noticed the doctor had been gone for a while. Being the people-pleaser type, she chased after him, giving him space while letting him know she was there. He walked out to the smoking balcony and pulled out a cigarette. A moment later, Chloe stepped up with a smile and a lighter, “Need a light?” Her cheeks pulled wide in a pantomime of innocence. “Thanks, Chloe.” She lit the tip of his cigarette, and he puffed on it a few times to engage the flame. “So, your reason for choosing folklore back there, I don’t buy it, and I noticed that it made you uncomfortable enough to leave a party in our honor. I’m not saying you have to tell me, I’m just making sure you’re okay.”

Dr. Grant shallowly nodded his head a few times, as if he was giving himself a pep talk. He let out a reedy sigh before speaking, “No, I should be able to talk about it, I’m an adult, and it's been over 20 years now.” He paused a second to rally himself, “I had a daughter once, her name was Lilly, and she was the light of my life. But I was working long hours at my trading firm, and in the end, I chose to neglect everything and everyone in pursuit of the almighty dollar. One night, I was supposed to pick her up from soccer practice, but the market crashed, and I chose to try to salvage my earnings. The police only found her left shoe and a small hand-carved doll in her likeness.

The search dragged on for months with no progress. I was spending my days combing the woods and my nights drawing at the bar. The night I was considering ending it all, I overheard a couple of Folklore and Mythology majors discussing the Fae for their project. They were listing the traits of some of the monsters, and a carved doll effigy was among them. It suddenly all made sense: why no one could find her, why there was no sign of the abductor, and most puzzling of all, the effigy. I realized her abduction must be supernatural in origin.

This was a pretty shocking revelation: the Fae actually existed! I immediately sought the professor, a man named Gregarson, and together we uncovered enough circumstantial evidence to conclude that a Fae had taken her. Driven by my obsession, I devoted my entire life to the study of Folklore and the search for the creature that kidnapped my daughter.

To date, I have exautivly disproven several sightings and uncovered the true stories behind some local village legends, but I have not learned anything new about my daughters' abductors.” Dr. Grant hung his head as he spoke the last line, vainly trying to hide his eyes as they began to water. “Are you alright, Doctor?” Chloe asked with concern, noting his shift in demeanor. “Yes, I-I will be alright, thank you, Chloe. I should prepare for tomorrow's tours, good night,” Dr. Grant finished and made his way to the exit. Chloe felt a deep sadness as she watched the broken man shamble away. It was clear that he had chosen to believe a fairytale over the harsh reality of what he had done. She decided to return to the others but keep this exchange to herself.

After dinner, the group returned to their rooms to rest before tomorrow's busy day. Ben spent the time checking his equipment, while Chloe lay on the bed scrolling through the photos they'd taken that day. ""Look at this,"" she said suddenly. Ben came over. She'd zoomed in on a photo of the harbor, taken that afternoon. In the background, barely visible among the fishing boats, was a figure. A man, standing on one of the boats, facing the camera. The distance and quality made the details impossible to discern, but something was unsettling about the way he stood, perfectly still, while everything else in the frame moved. ""Probably just a fisherman,"" Ben said. ""Probably,"" Chloe agreed. But she didn't sound convinced.

Chloe awoke suddenly. The hotel room was dark except for the faint glow of the alarm clock: 10:32 PM. The faint, ethereal sound of music had woken her, a stringed instrument. It was beautiful and haunting, and sounded as if it were coming from outside. She slipped out of bed and crept to the window, peering through the glass. The harbor was dark, the fishing boats were silhouettes against the inky water. On the pier where they'd met the old man earlier, stood a figure. He was tall and slender, dressed in what looked like old-fashioned clothes, a long coat, breeches, and high boots. He was holding a golden fiddle, its surface gleaming even in the faint moonlight.

As she watched, he looked up, his face a pale oval in the darkness. He seemed to be looking right at her. A cold dread washed over Chloe. She stumbled back from the window, her heart pounding. She squeezed her eyes shut, and when she opened them again, he was gone. She stood there for a long time, her heart racing. It was just a dream, she told herself. A nightmare, brought on by the old man's story. But the music... the music had felt so real.

The next morning, the sky was a bruised purple, the air laden with the promise of a storm. The group met for breakfast, their conversation subdued. Chloe didn't mention her experience. She was sure they'd tell her she should skip the tour and get some rest; instead, their morning was spent on a guided tour of the outskirts of Kråkvik, a ""slice of life"" experience designed to show them the realities of rural Norwegian life. Their first stop was a small, windswept sheep farm overlooking the sea. The air was thick with the smell of lanolin and damp earth. The farmer, a weathered man named Lars with a face as rugged as the coastline, communicated more through his work than his words.

He gave a masterful demonstration of sheep shearing, his hands moving with a speed and precision that left Jess struggling to get a good shot for her blog, adding to the others' amusement. One of the Lambs bolted from her during an attempt at a selfie. Next, they visited a fish-smoking hut, an ancient, dark building where the air was thick with the aromatic smoke of alder wood and salt. Hundreds of cod hung from the rafters like leathery ghosts, their bodies slowly turning golden in the gloom.

The owner, a silent, pipe-smoking man, simply nodded at them as they entered, his presence as much a part of the atmosphere as the smoke itself. David, the software engineer, looked particularly out of place, his city clothes a stark contrast to the raw, elemental nature of the place. Dr. Grant called it ""a temple to the bounty and brutality of the sea."" Their final stop was the cottage of a woman named Astrid, a tiny, cheerful woman with a galaxy of wrinkles around her kind eyes. Her home had a traditional sod roof and a small, meticulously tended vegetable garden. Inside, it was warm and smelled of coffee and cardamom. Astrid showed them how to make lefse, the traditional Norwegian flatbread, on a cast-iron stove that had been in her family for generations. She offered them a piece, warm and spread with butter and sugar. It was simple, perfect, and deeply comforting.

Suddenly, Ben felt the call of nature. Astrid smiled and pointed him to the hallway leading towards the rear of the house. As he walked down the narrow hallway, a flickering light from a slightly ajar door caught his eye. Curiosity piqued, he peeked inside. It was a small, dark room, almost a closet. On a small table was a shrine. In the center stood a small, hand-carved statuette of a fisherman, dressed in what looked like 1600s-era clothing. At its feet was a small, shallow bowl of water, its surface reflecting the flickering candlelight of a single, tall candle. The air was thick with the smell of wax and something else that he couldn't place.

Ben stared for a moment, an uneasy feeling creeping over him. He quickly used the bathroom and rejoined the group. As they walked back toward the bus, he told the others what he'd seen. Dr. Grant nodded thoughtfully. ""Sounds like a fisherman's shrine. It's an old tradition. Families would have them in their homes to pray for the safety of their loved ones at sea. A small offering of water, a candle to light their way home. It's a way of showing respect to the sea, of asking for its mercy."" Chloe went pale. The casual academic explanation did nothing to calm the sudden, frantic beating of her heart. ""The long coat,"" she whispered, her voice trembling. ""The boots... the clothes... they were from the 1600s."" The others looked at her, confused. ""What are you talking about?"" David asked. ""My dream,"" she said, her eyes wide with dawning horror. ""The man I saw outside the window was wearing the same clothes."" An uncomfortable silence fell over the group, the comforting warmth of Astrid's cottage replaced by a creeping dread. The remainder of the trip was uneventful, and the spine-chilling revelation slowly faded into memory as the group took in Scandinavia's untouched splendor.

That evening, the group gathered at the designated bus stop, the wind whipping at their jackets. The sky was now a dark, angry grey. They were the first to arrive, well ahead of the other tourists. ""I don't like the look of that sky,"" David said, his voice tight. When the first bus pulled up, Jess had an idea. ""I'll give you five hundred kroner if you take us to the lighthouse now, ahead of the others,"" she said to the driver, a young man with a bored expression. ""We want to get the best spot for photos."" The driver's eyes lit up at the sight of the cash. He glanced around, then shrugged. ""Get in,"" he said.

As they drove, the storm began to break. Rain lashed against the windows, and the wind buffeted the bus as it crossed the narrow causeway, the only road connecting the lighthouse island to the mainland. ""Are you sure we'll be safe out there?"" Dr. Grant asked, his voice laced with concern. ""The lighthouse has been decommissioned for decades, hasn't it?"" The driver laughed. ""Don't worry. A few years ago, a wealthy benefactor bought the whole island. Poured millions into it. The lighthouse is completely remodeled, state of the art. Safer than your own home now. There's even a little museum in the basement with all the old stuff.""

He pulled up to the base of the lighthouse, a towering black and white cylinder against the stormy sky. ""Here you are. I'll be back in about forty minutes with the others. Explore, take your photos. Just stay inside if the weather gets bad."" Dr. Grant leaned forward, his brow furrowed. ""I have to ask, you're American, aren't you? Your accent. How did you end up driving a tour bus in rural Norway?"" The driver glanced at him in the rearview mirror, his smile quick and professional. ""A Work visa, good pay, and a Beautiful country."" He gestured out at the storm. ""Though the weather takes some getting used to.""

He turned the bus around and headed back across the causeway. As it drove away, a light post lit up the logo on the back of the bus; it was a hollow cog wheel with the initials SJ in red and black letters. ""Huh,"" Ben muttered, squinting through the rain. ""That's an odd logo for a local tour company. Looks pretty corporate."" The group dashed into the lighthouse, laughing as the cold rain soaked them in seconds. The heavy oak door swung shut behind them, and the surprising warmth of a modern central heating system greeted them. ""Wow,"" Jess said, pulling out her phone to film. ""Five-star lighthouse living, guys!"" Ben headed straight up to the observation deck and set up his tripod, eager to capture the dramatic waves crashing against the rocks below. Dr. Grant, his curiosity piqued by the mention of a museum, headed off to explore the basement. Jess was already filming a panoramic sweep of the living quarters, narrating about the ""cozy lighthouse vibes"" for her followers.

David collapsed onto one of the modernized benches, grateful to be out of the storm. ""This place is actually pretty nice,"" Jess said, panning her camera across the renovated interior. ""Look at this, heated floors and modern lighting."" Chloe wandered through the space, taking in the blend of historic charm and contemporary comfort. The original stone walls had been preserved, but everything else felt almost luxurious. It was hard to reconcile this warm, well-appointed space with the ominous warnings they'd received. After a few minutes, she climbed the spiral staircase to join Ben on the observation deck.

The view was breathtaking and terrifying. The storm had intensified, and the sea was a churning mass of grey and white. ""The tide's coming in fast,"" Ben said, not looking up from his camera. He was adjusting his settings, trying to capture the drama of the waves. ""Look at the size of those swells."" Chloe pressed closer to the window, her breath fogging the glass. The waves were noticeably larger now and dangerously close to breaking over the causeway. ""Ben,"" she said, her voice tight. ""Look at the road."" He lowered his camera and followed her gaze. His face went pale. ""You guys!"" Chloe called down the stairs, her voice sharp with alarm.

""Get up here! Now!"" The others rushed up, crowding around the observation window. They watched in horrified silence as a massive wave, far larger than the others, rose up like a grey wall and crashed down onto the narrow strip of land. The causeway vanished completely beneath the churning, frothing water. For a moment, no one spoke. They just stared at the place where the road had been. ""It'll go back down, right?"" Jess asked, her voice small. ""When the wave passes?"" But the water didn't recede. Another wave crashed over the submerged causeway, and then another. The road was gone, swallowed by the sea. Jess was the first to break. ""Oh my God, we're stuck here!"" she cried, her voice rising in panic. ""We're trapped! What are we going to do?"" ""There's no cell service,"" David said, his face grim as he lowered his phone.

""So we can't call for help?"" Ben asked, turning away from the window. ""We're just... stuck here until the storm passes? When will that be?"" ""It could be days!"" Jess wailed, pacing back and forth. ""We don't have any food! We're going to starve!"" ""Everyone, calm down,"" Dr. Grant said, his voice firm but steady. He placed a reassuring hand on Jess's shoulder. ""Panicking will not help. Let's assess the situation logically. We are in a secure, modern building. We have heat and light. We are safe from the storm. The driver knows we are here. As soon as the storm breaks and the tide recedes, they will send help. We are not in any immediate danger."" His calm, authoritative tone had a soothing effect.

Jess stopped pacing, and Ben took a deep breath. ""He's right,"" David said. ""Freaking out isn't going to solve anything."" ""So what do we do?"" Chloe asked, her voice small. ""Just... wait?"" Dr. Grant's eyes twinkled with a hint of his earlier academic excitement. ""We do more than wait,"" he said. ""Think about it. We have this entire historic lighthouse to ourselves. No other tourists, no guides rushing us along. This is a unique opportunity for unabated exploration. Who knows what we might find? Let's treat this not as a crisis, but as an adventure."" The idea of exploring the lighthouse, of turning their predicament into an adventure, was a welcome distraction from their fear. It gave them a way to reclaim some control over their situation.

The main floor housed the keeper's living quarters, which were spartan and tidy. They found a small kitchen, a bedroom with a narrow cot, and a living area with a pot-bellied stove. But it was a heavy, iron door at the back of the living area, marked 'MASKINROM,' that drew their attention. ""Engine room,"" Dr. Grant translated. ""Must lead to the basement."" The door was unlocked. It opened onto a steep, narrow flight of stone steps, and a wave of cold, damp air, thick with the smell of salt and oil, washed over them.

They descended cautiously, using their phone flashlights to illuminate the way. The basement was a single, large, circular room. In the center, covered by a massive, dusty tarp, was a colossal object. Ben pulled back a corner of the tarp, and his flashlight beam glinted off a thousand facets of glass. It was the old Fresnel lens, a beautiful, intricate beehive of glass and brass, sitting cold and silent in the dark. Against the far wall were several wooden crates and metal filing cabinets, all marked 'ARKIV' - Archive. “This must be the museum the driver had mentioned. Let's see what we've got,"" Dr. Grant said, his voice echoing in the cavernous space as he pried open one of the crates. It was filled with leather-bound logbooks.

For the next hour, they lost themselves in the history of the lighthouse. The logs were mostly mundane - weather observations, records of passing ships, supply requests. But they painted a picture of a lonely, isolated life. They found old newspaper clippings, yellowed and brittle, detailing the lighthouse's construction, the shipwrecks it had prevented, and the lives it had saved. Ben found a series of photographs documenting the lighthouse's construction. One showed a massive metal crate being winched up from a barge onto the rocks below. ""That must be the original lens mechanism,"" Dr. Grant said, pointing to the photo. ""The Fresnel lens. It would have been shipped in a crate like that.

Then, in a dusty filing cabinet, Dr. Grant found a different kind of journal. It was smaller than the official logbooks, bound in worn, black leather. The handwriting was neat, precise. The first entry was dated 1983. He began to read aloud. The first several entries were filled with personal musings, complaints about the cold, and notes about his family back on the mainland. Then, an entry that froze them all. ""'October 12th, 1983,'"" Grant read. ""Worried about my brother, Olav. He took his boat out this morning, and the weather is turning. He's a good fisherman, the best in Kråkvik, but the sea is unforgiving. I lit a candle for him, as Mother always did.'"" ""Olav,"" Chloe whispered.

""The old man on the pier?"" ""His brother was the last keeper!"" Ben realized. ""The one who drowned!"" Grant kept reading. A few pages later, another entry. ""'November 2nd, 1983. A strange delivery today. A large shipping crate, brought by a private barge. The men who delivered it were not locals. They said it was 'specialized equipment' for the lighthouse, part of a new government initiative. But there was no official paperwork. They paid me in cash to keep quiet about it. I don't like it. The crate is down by the salt pools. They said it was too heavy to bring up to the lighthouse.'"" Grant flipped forward a few more pages, finding another entry. ""'November 5th, 1983,'"" he read, his voice barely a whisper. ""'I hear music at night. A beautiful, terrible music. It seems to be coming from the north side of the island, from the direction of the crate. It calls to me. I find myself wanting to go to it. I have to lock myself in at night to keep from walking out into the storm. God help me, what is happening here?'""

The winds of the storm had been whipping the waves larger and larger, and a substantially sized wave managed to take out several power lines for the lighthouse, the lights inside immediately going dark and settling a deathly hush on everyone. Just when Jess was about to say something, a musical note drifted down the stairs. ""What was that?"" Chloe whispered, her eyes wide. Another note floated on the air, seeming to come from all directions at once, masking the storm\`s rage. Chloe moved toward the stairs, and by the time she reached them, a beautiful melody was forming. As she climbed, though, it began to morph into a sinister undertone that made the hair on the back of her neck stand up. Her heart began to race. She felt a compulsion building in her chest, a need to go outside, to find the source of the music.

Her feet moved faster, climbing the stairs toward the door. And then she remembered. The music from the hotel, the wet man, Olav's warning. Piecing it together quickly, she shouted back to everyone, ""COVER YOUR EARS!"" as she slammed her palms hard against the sides of her head, pressing her ears shut. The effect was immediate. The compulsion drained from her body like water from a broken vessel. The tension in her chest released, and she could breathe again. The music was still there, a muffled throb through her palms, but the terrible pull was gone.

""Do it!"" she screamed at the others. ""Cover your ears! Don't listen to it!"" The others followed her lead, a frantic scramble. Ben jammed his fingers into his ears. David pressed his palms flat against his head. Jess tore strips from a nearby curtain, stuffing the fabric into her ears. Dr. Grant found some cotton wadding in a first aid kit and stuffed his ears. As soon as their ears were blocked, the same relief washed over each of them. The compulsion had vanished. They stood there, breathing hard, looking at each other with wide, terrified eyes.

“Våtmannen,” Dr. Grant whispered.

Hours passed. David's fingers, jammed deep into his ears, had gone numb. His shoulders burned with a fire that spread down his spine. Every few minutes, he had to shift his weight from one foot to the other, his legs trembling with the effort of standing still for so long. He tried to lower himself to the floor, thinking that if he could just lie down, rest his arms against the floorboards, he might be able to hold on a little longer, but his exhausted muscles betrayed him. He slipped on the damp floor, and in his attempt to catch himself, he landed on his left index finger, bending it backward at a sickening angle.

The pain was blinding, white-hot. David screamed, a raw sound of agony, and before he could react, the music rushed in. David's face went slack, and A look of blissful, ecstatic wonder replaced the agony in his eyes. ""Oh God,"" Chloe whispered, watching in horror. A slow smile spread across his face. ""I hear it,"" he whispered. ""It's a beautiful dance."" He stood, the pain seemingly done, and began to move, his body swaying to the rhythm of the unseen fiddle.

He danced to the heavy oak door and threw it open, the storm roaring into the room, and then he danced out into the rain and the wind, a silhouette of mad joy against the raging sea. On a rocky point at the edge of the island, the figure of Våtmannen stood, his golden fiddle catching the lightning flashes. He was playing, his fingers moving with impossible speed, his eyes fixed on the approaching dancer. David danced right up to him, his face a mask of pure ecstasy, and reached out, as if to embrace the source of the beautiful music.

Våtmannen stopped playing, and the spell shattered. David blinked. The ecstasy drained from his face, replaced by dawning horror. He looked down at his hands, one still reaching toward the creature, the other with his broken finger jutting out like a twisted branch. The pain hit him again, a white-hot lance of agony that made him gasp and stagger backward. ""No,"" he whispered, his voice hoarse. ""No, what did I—"" He looked around wildly. The storm. The rocks. The sea crashing just feet away. He was outside. How had he gotten outside?

His friends were tiny figures in the doorway of the lighthouse, their faces pale with horror. ""Help!"" he screamed, his voice breaking. ""HELP ME!"" He tried to run, but his legs were weak, his muscles trembling. He took one step, then another, slipping on the wet rocks. His broken finger throbbed with each heartbeat, the pain making him dizzy. Våtmannen watched him with deep, ocean-colored eyes. There was a patient hunger behind them, like a predator stalking its prey.

Then he pounced. He moved with an unnatural speed, his face twisting into a mask of monstrous hunger. He threw himself upon David, clamping his dripping hands over David's face, and began smothering him. David tried to scream, tried to fight, his good hand clawing at the creature's arms, but it was like fighting the ocean itself. One of his swipes caught His broken finger on the creature's coat, and the pain was blinding. His desperate struggle grew weaker, his movements more sluggish as his life was extinguished on the wet, black rocks in the storm.

Våtmannen stood, gripping David's corpse by the ankle and dragged it across the rocks, into the sea with him. Inside the lighthouse, the four remaining members scrambled back from the open doorway, the image of David's suffocation burned into their minds. Jess vomited, her whole body heaving with such force that her legs gave out. Ben caught her before she collapsed, his own hands shaking so badly he could barely hold her up. ""He's gone,"" Chloe whispered, her voice hollow. ""David's gone.""

Dr. Grant, his face ashen, stumbled back from the window. ""My God,"" he whispered, his academic curiosity replaced by raw, visceral horror. ""What are we going to do?"" Jess sobbed, her body wracked with tremors. ""It's going to come back for us!"" ""We have to barricade the door,"" Ben said, his voice taking on a frantic edge. They sprang into action, their panic giving way to a desperate, frenzied energy. They dragged the old keeper's desk, the pot-bellied stove, and the heavy wooden benches over and piled them against the main door. They worked in a frantic, terrified silence; the only sounds were the grunts of exertion and Jess\`s sobs. When they were finished, the living quarters was a fortress. They huddled together in the center of the room.

Every creak of the old lighthouse, every gust of wind, made them jump. Time seemed to stretch as the silent terror gripped the group. Finally, Ben had had enough and spoke up, “We can't just sit here,"" he said, his voice raspy. ""We can't just wait for it to come back."" ""What do you suggest we do, Ben?"" Jess snapped, her voice sharp with grief and anger. ""No, I mean... maybe there is a way to fight it. A way to stop it.""

""Maybe there are more journals,"" Chloe said, her voice barely a whisper. ""Maybe there are other records. Something that tells us more about it, ""We only looked through one crate of logbooks. There were others. And the filing cabinets... we only checked one of them,"" Dr. Grant said. ""So we have to go back down there,"" Ben said. A fresh wave of terror washed over the group. The thought of leaving their fortified living area was almost unbearable. ""We can't split up,"" Jess said, her voice trembling. ""We have to stay together.""

""She's right,"" Chloe agreed. ""We can't risk it."" ""But we can't just sit here and wait to die!"" Ben argued, his voice rising. ""I'll go,"" Dr. Grant said quietly. They all turned to look at him. The professor, shaken by David's death, now seemed to have found a new resolve. ""I'm the one who should go,"" he said. ""I'm a Folklore researcher. I know what to look for. You three search up here. I'll be back as soon as I find something.""

""No,"" Chloe said immediately. ""It's too dangerous."" ""It's more dangerous to do nothing,"" Dr. Grant countered. ""We need information, and the only place we might find one is in those archives."" They argued for several minutes, but Dr. Grant was right; they couldn't just sit there and wait. Reluctantly, Chloe agreed. ""Be careful,"" She said, her voice tight with fear. ""I will, Chloe. You take care of them as well,"" he said. ""I'll be back before you know it."" He entered the stairwell and closed the door behind him.

Down in the basement, Dr. Grant moved with a sense of purpose. The fear was still there, but it was overshadowed by a lifetime of academic curiosity. He was in the presence of something that seemed to be very real, and he needed to be sure of what he was dealing with. He opened another of the ledger crates and began to sift through the logbooks. He found more of the same weather reports and shipping logs, so He moved to the filing cabinets and found them filled with official documents, maintenance records, and correspondence with the government.

He was about to give up when he found a thick, leather-bound ledger tucked away in the back of a drawer. It was mostly filled with dry accounting, fuel costs, supply orders, and maintenance expenses. But as he flipped through the pages, a single, folded piece of paper slipped out from between them. It was a shipping manifest, dated 1982.

His eyes scanned the document. It detailed the delivery of a single, large crate, marked ""HAZARDOUS MATERIALS - BIOLOGICAL."" The shipping company was listed as ""Skarlagen Narr,"" but the logo was a familiar corporate design: a hollow cogwheel with the initials ""SJ"" at its center. ""SJ..."" Dr. Grant mouthed the letters, a flicker of recognition in his mind, the logo had been on the back of the tour bus! He set the manifest down, his mind racing. Someone had shipped some dangerous creature here in the 80s. And whoever had done it was likely tied to the tour company.

He heard a soft rustling sound behind him and turned. In the far corner of the basement, partially hidden behind the old Fresnel lens, a part of the canvas tarp was billowing gently, as if caught in a breeze. Dr. Grant approached and slowly reached out, gripped the edge of the tarp, and, with a sharp breath in, pulled it up, revealing a small hatch door. It was circular and made of heavy iron, with a wheel lock at its center, like on a submarine.

The door was pitted with rust and salt corrosion, but the hinges looked well-oiled. Dr. Grant knelt beside it, his hands trembling. Every instinct screamed at him to leave it alone, to run. But he was a researcher and a man of Discipline. His entire life had been built on the principle of seeking truth, no matter where it led.

His fingers closed around the wheel lock, and he turned.

Nothing happened; the hinges may have been oiled, but the wheel felt rusted solid. He took a deep breath and planted his feet. The wheel resisted at first, grinding against decades of salt and rust, but it finally gave way. He pulled the door open, and a wave of cold, damp air rushed up from below, carrying with it the smell of salt and rot. A ladder with rusted metal rungs descended into the darkness. Grant shone his flashlight down, but the beam didn't make a dent in the Tenebrosity. The obvious choice of closing the hatch and returning upstairs to find a way out of this situation never even crossed his mind. Dr. Michael Grant was, at his core, a man possessed, and now he found himself potentially within arm's reach of real proof of his efforts.

Within seconds, he was on the ladder. The descent felt endless, rung after rung after rung after rung, the air growing colder and damper the deeper underground he travelled. His phone light bounced off the algae-covered stone walls, illuminating the immediate area in sweeping arcs. The roar of the ocean could be heard, but it was muted, as if it were on the other side of a wall. A dim glow began at the perceived bottom of the ladder; it grew a little brighter as he neared the end, and he could make out that the floor was made of wet, flattened rocks.

He stepped off the ladder into a chamber, maybe fifteen feet across, but perfectly circular, carved from the living rock. The walls glittered under his flashlight beam, but the true horror lay in the center of the room. There was a raised stone platform with a man-sized nest made of thick layers of dried kelp and seaweed, but the kelp on the top layer still looked fresh. Across the room from the nest was a hole in the floor. Dr. Grant approached it slowly, his breath misting in the cold air. The hole was perhaps four feet across, and when he shone his light down into it, he could see the black ocean water moving with a slight current from somewhere.

Dr. Grant's mind reeled. This must be Våtmannen\`s lair! He quickly started searching around the room, looking for anything that could help. He moved to the wall and saw something carved into the stone. He moved closer, opening his camera app. It was a runestone, an actual, genuine runestone, fitted directly into the chamber wall. The runes were old but perfectly preserved, as if freshly carved. He took a few pictures, then went back to searching the room, moving to the kelp nest.

As he drew closer to the nest, the odor of rot became much stronger. Dr. Grant struggled not to gag as he stepped up and peeked inside, intending to get a quick look and then run away, but his eyes alighted on a rather large diamond necklace that was poking out of the leaves. He made the split-second decision that he was safe enough, and he snatched the necklace up. But it only moved a few inches before getting stuck on something.

He pulled his shirt up over his nose and breathed in shallow breaths, minimizing the amount of rot he inhaled with each breath. Once he was fully sated, he pulled with more force and felt the necklace dislodge. He increased the torque on his pull, and the tension on the other end of the necklace gave way as the necklace and the neck it was around came flying out of the kelp and seaweed.

Dr. Grant let go of the necklace and leaped backwards, shrieking in terror. He turned and raced back up the ladder, his lust for adventure replaced by his fight or flight response. He still had the presence of mind to hang onto his phone and the document he found in the ledger, though. Once he reached the basement, he quickly closed the hatch and went around searching for something to bar the hatch with. He found an old crowbar that must have been used to open the crates in the photos of the lighthouse's construction, and jammed it into the lock mechanism, sealing the hatch shut.

Having created separation between himself and the threat, Dr. Grant took a moment to steady himself before wobbling over to a chair in the corner of the room. He sat down heavily, his body shivering uncontrollably from the adrenaline, and began to box breathe.

In 2…3…4…Out..2..3..4..Hold…2…3…4…Repeat. Having calmed himself, Dr. Grant pulled out his phone, opened the gallery app, selected the picture of the rune, then took out his notebook and pen.

ᛘᛅᚦᚱ:ᚴᛁᚱᛏᛁ:ᛋᛅᛏ:ᛅᛏ:ᚢᛁᚴ:ᚼᛅᛚᛏᚱ:ᚴᚢᚾᛅᛏᚢ:ᛘᛁᚦᛅᚾ:ᚢᛁᚴ:ᚴᛁᚾᚴᚱ:ᛘᚢᚾ:ᚼᛅᚾ:ᛅᛁᚴᛁ:ᛏᛅᚢᦒ:ᚠᛁᛘ:ᚴᛁᛅᚠᛁᚱ:ᚴᛁᚴᚾ:ᚠᛁᛘ:ᚢᛁᚴᚢᛘ:ᚴᛅᚠᛅ:ᛋᛁᚴᚱ:ᛅᚢᦒᚱ:ᚢᚱᚾ:ᚢᛁᛏ

Halfway through translating the first Galdr, a flash of light burst behind Dr. Grant's eyes, fading just as quickly. He shook his head to clear the sensation and returned to translating, telling himself it was just shock. Not long after, though, he was hit by another flash, but this one came with a vision: Våtmannen, alive and human before a crowd, playing the fiddle. He misses a note, and the crowd rumbles with dissatisfaction, visibly frustrated by his mistake and the audience's reaction. The man strikes another wrong chord, producing a cat-like screech that makes the audience flinch, and some rise and leave.

The vision ended abruptly, leaving Dr. Grant staring at the inscription again. A moment later, he regained his wits, having processed all that he had just witnessed. His first thought was to rush up the stairs and share the experience with the others, but then his rational mind kicked in, and he realized the vision might not be directly linked to the runes he was translating. It was much more likely that his frightening experience in the cave below had amped his adrenaline and anxiety too much, and he had just had a simple mini-stroke.

He continued translating, deciphering the name Byrgir, and was once again blinded by a vision, this time of the man sleeping in a hammock in the forecastle of a ship, his once fine clothes now soiled and torn. A shout from above decks startles him awake, and he leaps out of the sling, landing firmly on his feet. The shout rings out again, and he rushes up the stairs to the top deck. As soon as his head cleared deck level, he heard a whistle and turned, just in time to catch a boot to the face. The force of the impact knocked him out, and his unconscious body crashed to the ground, only to roll slowly down the sloped steps.

Dr. Grant once again came to his senses, though there was no denying it this time, that vision had been a direct result of translating the Galdr. This should have terrified him, but he was in too deep. I can find the answers in these visions, he justified to himself as he continued to translate. Nearly halfway through the engraving, he was struck by a third vision: the man drunk at a tavern, listening to a brilliant musician; after the show, he approaches him and asks how he got so good. The corners of the man's mouth stretch a bit too far as he tells him about the Wishmaster.

The vision flashes forward to the man entering a beaded doorway into a heavily incensed, dimly lit room with a small table and two chairs. A wizened old man appears from a side room and bows, motioning for him to sit. They both sit down at the table, and the old man takes a long look, sizing him up before smiling and extending his hand. “Velkominn, Byrgir”. The man stops for a second, struck that he knew his name, but he quickly recovered, remembering he was here to speak to a mystic.

The two men clasp hands, and for a split second, both men’s eyes glow red. When they unclasped the handshake, the deal was complete, and the man left the tent; no other words were spoken. The vision moves forward in time to show the man playing to a packed crowd, and then later that night. In a hotel room full of drunk women, the man silently smothers one before quietly returning to bed.

Dr. Grant came to his senses again and stared at the runes. Only one Galdr was remaining, but a sudden droplet of blood splashed on the phone screen. He reached up and felt the blood dripping from his nose. He wiped his screen, took a deep breath, and began reading the final Galdr. He expected it, but was still unprepared, as another vision overtook him. Time moved forward in great leaps, and he watched as the man played out a repeating pattern of performance and murder again and again, but the longer he continued, the more he began to change.

It started gradually, with a light greenish hue spreading across his body. After twenty years, his entire body had taken on a mottled green and black appearance; no one wanted to hire a monster to play music at their fancy dinner party. But he still had the compulsion to kill; after so long, it had become a comforting ritual that he could perform when things got a little too much. He used his tainted talent to lure people to the riverside, where he would drown and stab them to death, offering them as his sacrifice to the old man in return for his gift.

Gradually, over centuries, he ceased to be Byrgir the musician and became Våtmannen, the murderous spirit. In a cruel twist, he found he was able to grant certain boons to mortals, but he would only grant them to those who offered him sacrifice. He amassed a cult following of murderous zealots that once terrorized the coasts of Norway before the kingdoms banded together and hunted them to near extinction, making it a crime punishable by death to worship Våtmannen.

Dr. Grant began to hear whispers in the vision, as if something were attempting to speak directly to him: ""I know where she is…."" I can show you… He knew it was a trick, but it was the one trick that he couldn’t afford to ignore. “Show me,” he whispered hollowly. The vision shifted to show the wooded trail where his daughter had disappeared. Dr. Grant felt a cold vise start to close around his heart as the realization set in.

He let out a sudden, gasping sob as his daughter, alive and exactly as he remembered her, came skipping down the path. He tried to call out to her, tried to move, but he was only a spectator in Våtmannens dream. Then there was a flash of movement as something large and green shot out of the woods and snatched her. A Troll, an actual living Troll, held her in his massive hands, sniffing her hair curiously. Dr. Grant's heart began to pound, threatening to explode under the adrenaline coursing through him.

Then, without warning, the Troll opened his maw and shoved her head inside, slamming his jaws shut with a squelching pop, severing her head in a clean bite. Dr. Grant felt his bowels release; the Troll finished chewing and swallowed the mushy goop, raising her body to his mouth again for another bite. He had to watch as the Troll finished her off entirely; only her left shoe remained after it had fallen off during her consumption. By the time it was finished, Dr. Grant\`s mind had broken, reducing him to a sobbing and gibbering mess. His only coherent request was “K-kill mee.”

Våtmannen approached Dr. Grant and took his head in his hands, forcing their eyes to meet. The gaze of Våtmannen was intense, peering directly into Dr. Grant's tormented soul.

Y*ou are ready, Michael Grant…. You belong to me….*

Dr. Grant was powerless and was about to accept his end at this monster's hands when it continued,

*You will serve me…. And I will give her back to you…*

Dr. Grant snapped back to himself, finding the strength deep within himself to speak, “Y-you can do that?” he asked shakily.

*That and much more,* *Michael Grant…. Will you serve me*…

Dr. Grant did not spare a second thought, “Yes. Yes, I will serve you to get my daughter back.”

Both Dr. Grant's and Våtmannen's eyes glowed red briefly, and when he was released, Dr. Grant felt a new sense of purpose,

*Deliver them to me… Before the sun rises… And she will return…*

Våtmannen hissed in his low voice, and then the vision ended. Dr. Grant found he was sitting in the basement, in soiled clothing, still clutching his phone and the note from the ledger. He immediately deleted the photo and tore the note into scraps, which he then ate. He unbarred the hatch door and descended into Våtmannen's lair, stripping his clothes off, he began to wash himself and his underclothes in the seawater below the cave. Once he was finished, he climbed back out of the lair and closed the hatch, leaving it unbarred, and ascended the stairs to rejoin the group.

The others had spent their time roving the base of the lighthouse, checking for any gaps in their barricade while also looking for more information on the mysterious island, and it seemed they were successful as Dr. Grant emerged from the basement to find the group huddled together in the keepers' room. Chloe caught sight of him and hurriedly waved him over, “Dr. Grant, we\`ve found a radio!” she said excitedly. Dr. Grant looked from her to the Ham radio, which had been covered by a cloth sheet previously, and despite the power being out, was powered on with static crackling softly over the speaker.

“Do you know how to use one Doctor?” asked Ben. Dr. Grant smiled inwardly at their ignorance. “No, I'm afraid I don’t, Ben,” he replied in a smooth and sweet tone. “Say, how is that thing still on when the power's out for the rest of the building?” “Probably a backup generator somewhere on the island,” Ben replied as he returned to fiddling with the knobs and buttons, searching for a signal.

“I found Våtmannen's lair, beneath the tower,” Dr. Grant said nonchalantly, “You found What?!” shouted Jess, after the words sunk in, “You mean it lives, Beneath us!” she was shaking now, her anxiety going into overdrive as she imagined the creature sneaking up when they were all asleep and dragging them back down to its lair.

“Yes, but it was empty. Perhaps it has another home or feeding location. I didn’t see David\`s body either.” Dr. Grant stated. “I think we could set a trap to capture or maybe even kill it, but we would have to strike now. While it's away,” He said, laying the foundation of his nefarious plot. A look of uneasiness swept across the group, and they wrestled with the new plan of action. Dr. Grant continued, “There isn’t enough room for all of us, and it wouldn’t make much sense for us all to go down there and get caught unawares. Ben, why don’t you come with me. This is a job best fit for a young strapping lad such as yourself; no need to put the womenfolk in more danger.”

“Dr. Grant, are you ok? Asked Chloe, “You\`re talking weirdly, and it's freaking me out a little.” She finished. Dr. Grant looked at her, his eyes burning with something, “Yes, it's probably just the extreme stress that we are all under, being alone in the basement likely didn’t do me any favors either.” This answer seemed to reassure Chloe as she reluctantly went back to examining the radio. “So Ben, what do you say, shall we trap this monster so we can escape?” Dr. Grant refocused his attention on Ben, who was considering the outcomes.

“Do you really think we can trap it down there, or even kill it?” he asked incredulously. “Without a doubt, Ben, I can guarantee this is the right plan of action.” Dr. Grant said confidently, extending his hand to Ben. Ben took the hand, stood, and together they made their way down to the basement. “It's just over here,” Dr. Grant said as he moved to the hatch door and pulled up the tarp. Gripping the handle, he twisted and pulled, opening the hatch and letting the wave of fetid sea air rush into the room. Ben gagged as the smell hit him and started to turn to run back upstairs when Dr. Grant called out to him. “Come on, Ben, we don’t have time to waste here.”

Ben cursed his shitty luck and moved to the opening, trying to shine his phone light down into the depths. Dr. Grant stealthily moved behind him and gave him a forceful shove, sending him tumbling down into the darkness. Ben landed hard on his left leg, and the resulting Crack! and jolts of pain that tore through his leg told him it was broken. He lay on the ground moaning, trying to reach his leg to look at it. Dr. Grant descended the ladder slowly, taking his time and ensuring he didn’t slip or miss a rung. Stepping down off the ladder into the room again, he took a quick look around and strode over to Ben's prone form. “I'm sorry, Ben, but you have to understand. This is for my daughter,” He said as he bent down and grabbed the foot of Ben's broken leg and began dragging him towards the sea hole. Ben's screams bounced off the smooth walls as each step Dr.Grant took pulled his leg sharply.

“He is going to return her to me, he showed me. I just have to give him what he wants, and I can have her back, you understand, right?” Dr. Grant said, dropping Ben's leg near the hole, his screams continuing to echo inside the lair. Dr. Grant squatted down next to Ben and gently placed his hands on either side of his head, ""You're not worth her life, right, Ben?” He then gripped his ears tightly and began bashing his head against the rock floor. Ben's screams turned into gurgles as blood filled his throat from the savage beating.

Dr. Grant let go of Ben's head and gripped his torso, lifting him up off the floor. He carried him over to the sea hole and dropped him in. The splash of freezing water shocked Ben back to awareness, and he immediately started struggling to stay afloat, his broken leg sending shockwaves of pain through his body each time he kicked. Suddenly, he felt a hand grip his useless foot and forcefully yank him under the surface.

Looking under the hand, Ben saw Våtmannen. He tried to hold his breath, but his panic was overwhelming. He let out a scream, releasing the remainder of his saved air as Våtmannen began to pull him down into the depths. Ben's chest burned, his lungs were starved of oxygen as he thrashed to break free of Våtmannens death grip. Våtmannen continued to drag him down lower, and the edges of his vision began to turn black. Finally, he could resist the urge no longer; he gulped a lungful of water, hoping only to make the end come quickly.

Våtmannen watched as Ben slowly stopped thrashing and became still, slowly bobbing in the underwater current. Våtmannen pulled his body down to his level and began to feast, biting directly into Ben's neck and ripping out chunks of flesh and muscle. The water around them began to mingle with the crimson cloud that billowed out of the gashes. Back in the lair, Dr. Grant inhaled deeply, a look of satisfaction on his face as he felt the Våtmannen feed. He took a few moments to clean himself off again and headed back up the ladder to the basement.

This time, he closed and barred the hatch again, making sure to leave the hatch uncovered as well for any others who might come looking later. He climbed the stairs and slowly exited the basement, adopting a look of horror and grief, prepared to weave a tale of terror to the others. Jess spotted him first and jogged over to greet him, noticing that Ben was not with him. Then she saw his face in better detail, and she knew immediately that something had gone wrong. She dropped to her knees and began to sob, the reality too much for her to bear.

Drawn by Jess\`s cries, Chloe rushed over and saw that only Dr. Grant had returned. Dr. Grant launched into his story, Ben falling off the ladder, going down into the lair, his broken leg, and his screams drawing Våtmannen. “I tried to drag him back up the ladder, but he was too heavy, and then he was on us. It was all I could do to escape myself and seal the hatch from the outside before he got me too.” He finished. His tale had enough reality in it to fool the group, and though they were all saddened by his loss, no one spoke about Ben again.

Hours passed in a state of suspended terror. They huddled together, the silence broken only by the howl of the wind and Jess\`s sobs. The grief felt like a physical weight, pressing down on them, but beneath it was a sharper, colder emotion: Fear.

Jess, unable to sit still, began to pace the room, her arms wrapped around herself. She kept glancing at the barricaded door, as if expecting it to burst open at any moment. It was during one of these restless turns that she heard a voice coming from the door.

""...help me...""

It was a whisper, faint and pained, barely audible over the storm. But she heard it. It was Ben's voice.

""Ben?"" she whispered, her heart leaping into her throat. She rushed to the door, pressing her ear against the cold, heavy oak.

""...so cold..."" the voice said, a little louder now. ""...I can't... I can't feel my leg...""

""Ben!"" she cried, her hands flying to the barricade. ""He's alive! He's outside! We have to let him in!""

Chloe rushed to her side. ""Jess, wait! It could be a trick!""

""Let us in, Jess,"" David's voice said. It was clearer, stronger, but there was something wrong with it. They were like a bad AI vocal clone. ""It's so cold out here. We're so cold.""

""Please, Jess,"" Ben's voice pleaded, ""We're hurt. We need help. Let us in.""

Jess froze, her hands hovering over the barricade. A chilling dread replaced the hope that had surged through her moments before. ""What is that?"" Chloe whispered, her face pale. ""That's not them.""

""Let us in,"" the voices chanted in unison, their tones perfectly synchronized, devoid of any human emotion. ""Let us in. Let us in. Let us in.""

While Jess and Chloe were frozen in terror at the door, Dr. Grant saw his opportunity. He moved to the keeper's room and closed the door. He moved over to the HAM radio and ripped the power cord from the back of the radio. He didn't stop there. He tore the antenna cable from its socket, the thick wire snapping with a sharp crack. The radio, their only hope of rescue, was now a dead, silent box.

Suddenly, a jagged fork of lightning split the sky, illuminating the main window in a brilliant, blinding flash. For a single, heart-stopping second, the storm outside was as bright as day.

He was standing on the jagged rocks just beyond the causeway, the waves crashing around his feet. He was tall and gaunt, his skin the color of a drowned man's flesh, his hair a tangled mess of seaweed and kelp. He was wearing the tattered remains of an old lighthouse keeper's uniform, and in his hands, he held a fiddle that seemed to be carved from gold.

Våtmannen.

As the thunder rolled, he raised the fiddle to his chin and began to play. The music was a haunting, ethereal melody that seemed to weave itself into the very fabric of the storm. It was beautiful and terrible, a song of sorrow and death that promised a cold, silent peace beneath the waves.

""The music!"" Chloe screamed, her hands flying to her ears. ""The earplugs!""

They scrambled for their packs, their hands shaking as they fumbled for the small, waxy plugs. Jess, her eyes wide with terror, shoved them into her ears, the world outside dissolving into a dull, muffled roar. Chloe did the same, her face a mask of grim determination. They burst through the keeper's room door to find Dr. Grant standing over the HAM radio, the frayed ends of the power and antenna cords clutched in his hand. The ruse was over.

""What did you do?!"" Chloe screamed, her voice a mixture of terror and rage.

Dr. Grant's face twisted into a snarl, his eyes burning with a fanatic's zeal, and with a guttural roar, he lunged at them, his body moving with a speed and ferocity that was utterly inhuman. He tackled Jess, sending them both crashing to the floor. Chloe rushed to help, but Dr. Grant, with a savage backhand, knocked her to the stone floor with a sickening crack, and she lay still, her eyes closed. Jess, her heart pounding with adrenaline, fought back with a desperate fury. She clawed at Grant's face, her nails digging into his skin, and jabbed her thumb into his eye, causing him to cry out in a high-pitched shriek that was almost inhuman. As if in response, the storm outside swelled, causing the entire lighthouse to groan under the strain.

Enraged, Grant bared his teeth, a low growl rumbling in his chest. He lunged at Jess's throat, his teeth sinking into the soft flesh of her neck. She screamed, a gurgling, choked sound, as he bit down and worked his jaw with a savage, chewing motion. He tore through muscle and sinew, the coppery taste of her blood filling his mouth, and with a final, brutal rip, he tore a chunk of her throat out, the warm, wet tissue a trophy in his mouth. Jess began to seize, her body convulsing on the floor. Blood spurted from her severed carotid artery, a hot, crimson fountain that sprayed across Grant's face and chest. He watched, his eyes wide and unblinking, as the life drained from her, a savage smile playing on his lips.

Before she was even still, he grabbed her by the hair and dragged her to the main door, her body leaving a bloody smear on the floor behind them. He threw it open, the storm winds howling into the room, and with a final, contemptuous shove, he threw her out into the maelstrom and slammed the door shut, the bolt sliding home with a deafening crack. Outside, Jess lay in a slowly expanding pool of her own blood, her body twitching with the last vestiges of life. Her vision swam, the world fading in and out of focus. Through the driving rain, she saw him approaching, Våtmannen, his movements jerky and unnatural, as if he were teleporting from one spot to the next. The last thing she saw was his waterlogged face leaning over hers, his mouth open to reveal a row of needle-sharp teeth. The world went black.

Inside the lighthouse, Dr. Grant watched through the window, his face illuminated by the flashes of lightning, as the Våtmannen knelt over Jess's body, devoured part of her face, and dragged her limp form into the dark waters. His grisly work done, Grant turned from the window, his blood-soaked face a wide, ecstatic grin. He strode over to Chloe's still form, the last piece of his grand offering, and felt a surge of divine purpose as he lifted her into his arms.

He carried her down into the belly of the lighthouse, descending the winding stairs into the basement museum and then down again, through the hidden hatch, into the sacred grotto. The bioluminescent fungi lighting his path as He gently laid her within the nest-like altar of kelp, as he turned to leave, he realized that she could wake up at any moment. He frantically searched the lair but found nothing. He raced up the ladder and saw that the tarp had some lengths of rope tying it down. Not wanting to waste time, he cut the knots free and used them to bind her wrists and ankles. He then stripped away her outer layers, leaving her underwear untouched. This was not an act of Sexual perversion, but of purification. She had to be presented in her purest form as the final sacrifice.

He fished around in the nest and pulled out a broken piece of bone from his earlier encounter, and used it to slice open his palm. Blood, dark and thick, welled up instantly. He dipped his fingers in and began to paint ancient, sprawling runes on her forehead, chest, stomach, and limbs. Each symbol was a word in a forgotten language, a plea and a promise to the deep one, delivered through him without comprehension.

When he was finished, Chloe’s body was a canvas of his devotion, the crimson symbols stark against her pale skin. He expected Våtmannen to emerge then, to rise from the dark water and claim his prize. But the grotto remained silent, the hole to the sea a placid, black mirror. A flicker of anger crossed Dr. Grant’s face. “I must call him,” Dr. Grant whispered, his voice raspy. “I must have my reward!” He turned and ascended the ladder, leaving Chloe alone in the silent, glowing dark.

The cold was the first thing Chloe felt, a deep, biting chill that seeped into her bones. Her head throbbed with a dull, persistent ache. She opened her eyes, and terror, sharp and absolute, jolted her into full consciousness. She was in the nightmare chamber from Dr. Grant’s stories, bound and half-naked on a bed of seaweed, her skin crawling with the sticky, drying sensation of the blood-runes. She began to thrash, pulling at the ropes with a desperate, animalistic strength. The coarse fibers bit into her wrists, but she barely felt the pain; the thought of escaping overwhelmed her senses.

Her frantic struggles dislodged her from the kelp nest, and she tumbled onto the cold, damp stone floor. She was still bound, but she was out of the altar. Her eyes darted around the cavern, searching for anything, any hope. Her eyes alighted on the broken bone Dr. Grant had used to cut his palm. Scrabbling like an insect, she managed to get her bound hands around it. Awkwardly, painfully, she began to dig and poke at the thick knot binding her wrists. The bone was sharp, and she cut her own skin several times as she worked, but she didn’t stop. The fear of what would happen when the monster came was far worse. Just as she felt the knot begin to loosen, she heard it. A deep, sloshing sound from the hole to the sea. He was coming.

With a final, desperate yank, her hands came free. She didn’t waste a second. She scrambled behind the large, tangled mass of the kelp nest, pressing herself into the shadows just as Våtmannen emerged from the water. Through a small opening in some of the bedding leaves, she watched as Våtmannen stalked to the nest, his gaze fixed on the empty, blood-stained kelp. He saw the ropes and let out A sound of pure, guttural frustration that echoed throughout the chamber, and thrashed its head side to side, searching the room. Finding nothing, he let out a final, enraged snarl and dove back into the black water.

Chloe didn’t dare breathe. She waited, her heart hammering against her ribs, for what felt like an eternity. Finally, she gathered her courage enough and sprinted for the ladder, her bare feet slapping against the wet stone, and scrambled up into the basement. She grabbed the rusty crowbar that Dr. Grant had set aside and quietly closed the iron hatch, ramming it through the handles. She fell onto her knees a moment later, the exhaustion catching up to her as the adrenaline worked its way out of her system.

For the first time since waking up, she allowed herself to feel. A sob escaped her lips, then another, and soon she was weeping, silent but intense, her body shaking with a storm of grief and terror. Her friends were dead. She was alone, and she was being hunted by a monster and the man she had trusted. Her sobbing was cut short by a new sound from above. It was Dr. Grant’s voice, echoing through the lighthouse. “Våtmannen! I have your final offering! "" He was opening doors and windows, his calls growing louder as the storm threatened to swallow his words.

Chloe’s eyes fell on the crowbar. She could take it, try to fight him. But the thought of facing him, of what he had become, filled her with a paralyzing fear. No. The crowbar was better here, keeping the hatch sealed. It was her only protection from the thing in the deep. Taking a deep, shuddering breath, she slowly, cautiously, began to climb the stairs, her mind a blank slate of terror, unsure of what she would do, where she would go. She just knew she had to escape.

Upstairs, in the lantern room at the very peak of the lighthouse, Dr. Grant worked with feverish intensity. He had found the old supplies in the museum: a can of whale oil, wicks, and a flint and steel. The great lamp, a marvel of brass and glass, was merely a decoration now, its light long since replaced by an automated electric beacon. But Grant had restored it.

With trembling hands, he filled the reservoir, threaded the wick, and struck the flint. A spark caught. A small flame flickered to life. He carefully placed the glass chimney over it, and the flame grew, steady and bright. He began to turn the great crank by hand, and the massive Fresnel lens began to rotate. A brilliant, sweeping beam of light illuminated the intensity of the storm.

Chloe reached the main floor, her breath coming in ragged gasps. Her eyes darted to the main doors, thrown wide open by Grant, the storm still raging beyond them. She was planning on making a dash for them when she saw Våtmannen standing on the rocks, his form a dark well of shadow in the bright light. Suddenly, a wild shout echoed from the stairs. ""Chloe?!"" Dr. Grant was caught off guard, but his frenzied rage returned quickly. “YOU WILL NOT FUCK THIS UP FOR ME, CHLOE, YOU ARE NOT WORTH HER LIFE!” He raced down the stairs, his face a mask of fury, his eyes burning with mad intent. Chloe didn't panic. She saw Grant closing in and juked, dodging his clumsy lunge and bolted towards the winding staircase, her only thought to put as much distance as possible between herself and the madman.

She flew up the stairs, her bare feet pounding on the hardwood tread, Grant's insane shouts echoing behind her. She reached the top, the lantern room, and slammed the glass pane door shut, fumbling with the thin iron bolt, sliding it home just as Grant’s body slammed against the other side. He roared, beating on the door with his fists. ""You cannot deny me! Your death will bring my Lilly back to me!"" It was a scene from a nightmare. He began to smash the glass with his fists, rattling the door violently, but soon cracks began to form and splinter out.

Chloe screamed as, with a final crash, Dr. Grant shattered enough of the glass to reach through and slide the bolt open. The door swung inward, and he stepped inside, a menacing silhouette cast by the bright lighthouse beam. ""Chloe, don’t fight this,"" he whispered, his voice dripping with unhinged conviction. ""It's the noble thing to do, Våtmannen needs a final sacrifice, and you\`re all that’s left. Give up, and I'll make it quick, please."" He muttered apologetically to her as he approached her.

Chloe backed away, her eyes darting around frantically. She spotted the can of whale oil and the book of matches, and an idea, desperate and terrible, formed in her mind. Grant lunged. Chloe rammed her shoulder into him, grabbed the oil canister, and splashed its remaining contents all over him. The slick, greasy liquid soaked his clothes. She scrambled past him, out of the small lantern enclosure, fumbling with the matchbook. Her hands were shaking so violently that she could barely strike one.

Grant roared in pain as the fuel got into his eyes. He charged toward where he last saw her, and just as he reached for her, a match flared to life. She thrust it forward into his chest. The effect was instantaneous. Grant erupted in a column of fire, a human torch, his screams of agony piercing. He stumbled backward, flailing, and collapsed into the lantern room, his burning body feeding the ancient lamp. The beacon, already bright, flared with a blinding white light that punched a hole through the storm clouds, momentarily illuminating the distant, sleeping town of Kråkvik.

Chloe slammed the busted door shut and watched in horror as Dr. Grant burned alive, his screams slowly dying as the flames consumed him, but as she stared at the brilliant, sweeping beam of light, a new sound reached her ears, weaving itself into the crackle of the flames.

She turned, levitating in the very center of the beam, seemingly having risen from the ocean, was Våtmannen. He raised the golden fiddle to his chin and began to play. The melody was inside her head, a beautiful, irresistible command. Her earplugs were long gone, she realized, lost in the struggle. Her terror melted away, replaced by a profound, blissful calm. The song was a promise of peace, of an end to the pain and the fear. It was a lullaby for a broken world. In a trance, her movements fluid and graceful, Chloe turned from the fire and began to walk.

She descended the stairs, walked past the bloody mess where Jess had been murdered, and out into the storm. She walked in a dreamlike state past the edge of the rocks and straight into the waves, the cold water a welcoming embrace, until it closed over her head, silencing the world forever. Beneath the lighthouse, in his lair, Våtmannen feasts on Chloe’s lifeless body, taking chunks of her stomach and thighs in single bites.

Julian closed the laptop he had been monitoring the livestream from, satisfied with another successful event. He truly was a master entertainer. He checked his watch and sighed, still four hours to go until he arrives in Italy, and then another 4 hours to the villa. He hated travelling, but it was a necessary evil when you ran an international entertainment empire, and he was a very hands-on style CEO.

Julien considered his options and decided to sleep the remainder of the journey, in his experience, surprise contestants like this next one tended to take a lot out of him. He checked his phone one last time and opened YouTube, launching a playlist by his favorite creator, Autisticspidey. He reclined in the chair and closed his eyes, his mind racing with possible themes for his next game.

1q2zf3m,https://i.redd.it/njlln50wy5bg1.jpeg,Five & Hoek - Big League Beans (v15),"Bought four bags of this in May, and they went directly into the freezer. Opened this penultimate bag this morning and it does not disappoint. It’s o juicy and sweet! I’ve been drinking this coffee since v12 and it has become a mainstay in my rotation. I usually keep a few bags of four of my favorite coffee beans in the freezer to enjoy around the other orders I place throughout the year. 

I ground 36g beans for 2-cup brew with V60 on grind setting 6 on the Ode gen2 with SSP burrs. Five pours: 100, 125, 125, 125, 100  (1:16 ratio).I just recalibrated the burrs yesterday for the first time since purchase 8 months ago. As you can see in the photo I have already adjusted the grind size slightly courser. 

I also brew 1-cup V60 with 18g beans and five pours

of 50, 60, 60, 60, 60 (1:16 ratio). 

This is what Five & Hoek say about the beans:

Julio Madrid, from Finca Milan, located in Risaralda, Colombia has become a household name for producing award winning coffees. Madrid takes a sought after varietal, processes it in sealed barrels (aka anaerobic fermentation) but also flushes it with nitrogen - creating a completely oxygen free environment. Ripe coffee cherries undergo embryonic stress, maintaining their temperature at 12 degrees. After pulping, the beans are placed in a bioreactor, inoculated with specific strains of yeast and bacteria for controlled fermentation. Nitrogen is injected to facilitate microbial metabolic processes, closely monitoring temperature, acidity, and Brix (sugar) degrees throughout. Following bioreactor treatment, the coffee beans are solar-dried to 40% moisture, then transferred to mechanical dryers until reaching 10%-12% moisture. The result is a coffee that tastes just like watermelon, bubblegum, and pink starburst. 

They roast it in March in time for MLB opening day. It’s kinda pricey at $28 for 8 ounces plus shipping. if it’s out of your range and want to try it, CHAT. ",8,1767458946.0,pourover,3,0.91,False

I know a lot of people don’t always have supportive family or friend situations, so I am sharing things I do that don’t involve other people - and that don’t require you to join a group or class etc…

1. Get a Bird identification app on your phone. I have had one for a few months now and I love it. You don’t even need to go outside to use it. You can just prop your phone against an open wIndow and it will identify all the different birds around you. I find it very calming. Even on a dull day, there is always some little bird chirping 🥰 I use Merlin Bird ID, but I think there are a few apps.
2. If you work from home some days, try taking your shower on your lunch break. Can’t really explain why, but I find it super therapeutic. Washes off the stresses of the morning, and leaves me feeling toasty and warm for the afternoon.
3. On the shower theme, if you take your shower at night, try taking your shower in low lighting. I will sometimes not use the main light in the bathroom and will use candles or little electric lamps instead. There is something very soothing about having a shower in lower lighting.
4. Stay off your phone for two hours, or a minimum of one hour, before bed. Doom scrolling is bad for the brain. A book or a movie (not too scary!) is much better and will allow your brain disengage before bed.
5. If it’s sunny, get outside and sit on a bench or wall with a cup of tea or coffee. Even if it’s cold, just wrap up really well. You don’t even need to go for a walk if you don’t want to, just get outside for 20 minutes or so.
6. Put a little aside in an envelope each week for a Spring Equinox gift to yourself. Even if it’s only a €5, or €1, or €10. Spring Equinox is March 20th. You can treat yourself to a nice handmade mug, or your favourite take out, a new top etc…
7. Don’t be afraid to go to the cinema by yourself. Lots of people do it. There is something beautiful about sitting in the dark in front of the big screen. Get a tea or coffee and a treat, and relax for two hours.
8. Plan a trip. Even a hypothetical one - one you would do if you won the Lotto / had a chunk of annual leave / got over your fear of flying etc… I can spend a happy hour planning a trip by train all over Europe 😅
9. Read a physical paper once a week. I started doing this when I realised how fired up my brain gets from constantly speed-reading news and articles online. Once a week I will get a physical newspaper (generally at the weekend, when there is more bang for your buck with the lifestyle and weekend sections) and take my time with it over some tea or coffee (and a few biscuits). If cost is an issue, many libraries have physical newspapers still.
10. Take a train journey for no reason other than to take a train journey. If I am super stressed with work, I will sometimes just go on a train journey (day trip) for no other reason than to sit on the train and read a book and look out the window. I have always loved the motion of a train, and it really relaxes me.

Today is May 28th, or maybe the 27th… what does it matter, except for the question it raises? The only reflection one could draw from it is precisely the reason for this questioning.

But I digress again.

My door is closed, silence reigns in the room, and rain hammers against my window. A musty, dusty smell is omnipresent; the furniture seems worn, even struggling not to give way under its own weight.

I stand there, sitting silently, my gaze lost in an abstract void, my eyelids half-closed.

Half-slumped in my chair, straining my already aching back.

I waited… I waited patiently, silently, my hair standing on end, for some brave and hungry rodent to decide to gnaw at the legs of my desk, thus managing to pull me from this weary and endless reverie.

The building itself seemed to be waiting with me, without a single creak or futile groan; calm reigned.

My door, for its part, remained closed, impassive, with no expectation of an unexpected visitor.

This is my world, my life, my daily routine, which for the past few long years seems to have been a dreary existence filled with unresolved and abstract questions. Distracted only occasionally, by an adventurous ray of sunshine daring to slip through the wall of grayish clouds that encircle my apartment.

I've always loved pondering the universe, the stars, life. More specifically, our own life: what's the point? Our time on Earth is utterly futile, and whether or not other forms of life exist somewhere in our galaxy, does it really matter? I don't think so, but you're free to believe what you wish.

I don't know,

I don't know anymore,

I don't think anymore,

I'm too tired of it all. Humanity disgusts me, and life itself revolts me just as much. May 29, 1984

I've finally decided to start writing again.

My past attempts haven't been entirely successful, but at least they've allowed my body to fill this void that inhabits me, almost terrifies me, devours me slowly, step by step. And although I know how to remedy it, it doesn't help.

On the contrary, it pushes me deeper, isolates me, and makes me ill. I dread that powerful fever, those tremors, and that metallic taste pricking my tongue, driving me to the brink of madness after writing a few pages too many.

That's why I stopped my last writing; I can still see myself trembling, struggling to write a few letters.

As I wrote, I felt this deep, dark abyss, spreading a chilling sensation throughout my entire body, coursing from one extremity to the other.

Coiling like a hungry serpent around my heart, squeezing me, even making me reel with pain.

I need to fill this void, to confess, I need to feel alive and to exist. I can't take these identical days anymore, from my meals to my sleep, from the mind-numbing ticking of the clock, from the restless breathing of the floorboards, from the crackling fluorescent lights.

I'm tired of these nights spent cursing every god that ever existed and praying to be delivered from this feeling.

My thoughts are desperately looping in my head.

My eyes are fixed on the ceiling, like a condemned man awaiting his sentence in the pitch black.

If there were a hell on Earth, I think it would look something like this: dull, lifeless days endlessly passing before my eyes.

Yes, I need this journey into my mind. No more monotonous days, no more moments of daydreaming. I will dedicate myself body and soul to this journal, I promise you, and even if no one reads it, I will write it.

Perhaps this would allow me to momentarily escape my loneliness and, above all, to show myself that other living beings on this Earth devoid of humanity share my bleak view of life.

Who, in this hideous world, finds no meaning and hardly has a place.

But as Nietzsche would so aptly put it (if he were still alive):

""He who has a why can endure any how.""

This sentence particularly resonates with me; no doubt it's the absence of a why in this absurd, meaningless world.

I hope that my why will be this book, and my how, I've decided, will be this weight that existence itself imposes upon me.

And it is you, dear reader, who will bear the heavy burden of enduring my profound weariness. My confidants, leave if you wish, I will not hold it against you; who would want to listen to a rigid man curse life?

Although I secretly hope that you will hate me, so that I may finally live for someone.

Yes, hate me, I would rather be hated than ignored. Since when have I ceased to exist for the world?

May 30, 1984

I got up, my mind clouded and confused.

My whole body felt heavy.

I sat for a few moments on the edge of the bed and paused.

I quickly scanned the chipped walls when my gaze was drawn to the coffee machine.

It was no longer in its place, and I didn't remember moving it yesterday.

Had I moved it intentionally?

But why would I have moved it?

I sat there silently, lost in thought, my body relaxed.

The sky seemed too gray, the apartment strangely quiet, and the dust oddly thick.

I lay down, staring for a long time at the dark ceiling, trying to find a way to dispel this unpleasant emptiness, like a lisp.

A strange feeling rose up then, oppressing me violently.

Or was it precisely the feeling that something was missing?

My heart felt very light… too light, as if the night had stolen something indefinable from me.

A door slammed in the distance.

I thought for a moment and got up, thinking that a short walk couldn't hurt.

I took a few steps, then, overcome by dizziness, sat back down, breathless.

Was it my body that was alerting me?

Minutes, then hours passed. This emptiness, like my shadow, wouldn't let go, awakening a slight unease within me.

Yet everything was… silent. Was it truly the same silence as yesterday?

There was nothing, or perhaps, precisely, there was everything.",1,1767458772.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Started going on dates again after 6 years of just living solo. When people would ask what I’m looking for, I never really knew what to say. I wasn’t sure if I was ready for anything serious or long-term. But after a while, I realized that it is consistency. I want something genuine, getting to know each other’s favorite food, interests, and even everyday struggles. I want to get to know someone deeply and start off from there. 

For some context: 

•I’m 23, 5’3, and a morena

•Grad from the green school

•Living in QC 

•Working in corpo (to which I need a life outside of)

•A big foodie

•Likes sleeping in and spending quality time

•A yapper who always has something to say (😅)

Preferences:

•Hopefully around 23-28 years old

•From QC also or somewhere nearby (so we can grab food or coffee after a long day)

•Someone consistent and looking for something serious

1q2z9zp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q2z9zp,#conformitygate - What Next? - Netflix,"So I’ve gone way too deep into this Conformity Gate rabbit hole, and I’m trying to figure out if Netflix hid messages in the brand spot they dropped a couple of days before the final episode aired.

The spot barely explains anything, but if you pause/screenshot the glitch moments, there might be some Easter eggs hiding in there:

\- It starts with the protagonist of the spot looking a lot like Joyce, at a bus stop clearly branded for Stranger Things Season 5. When she hops on the bus, the interior lights flicker, feeling very upsidedown-coded

\- **Appa scene**: When Appa appears, there’s a kid in the top-left corner who looks a lot like Mike (could be Will too—hard to tell).

\- **Second glitch:** This one is much clearer and really looks like Eleven in the water tank.

\- **Third glitch:** A girl falling straight toward the camera. Possibly Holly? Or Max?

\- **Bus scene**: No red glitch here (aka Vecna’s eye?), but something feels off. The girl on the left has an “EST” tag on her ponytail. Then, at the bus stop, the main woman in the video (low-key looks like Joyce) takes a sip from a coffee cup that says “TIME”, with some numbers underneath that I can’t quite read. Might be connected to the EST tag… or might be nothing.

\- **Tarot card glitch – The Moon:** The Moon symbolizes the subconscious, fear, illusion, and things hidden beneath the surface.

Which honestly fits Stranger Things perfectly—trauma, distorted reality, intuition over logic, etc.

\- **Another glitch**: There’s a death symbol at the bottom of the coffee cup, and a kid who looks a LOT like Dustin in Season 3.

\- **Final scene:** This might be a stretch, but in the last shot with the tarot reader and the text “What Next?”, there’s a toy/avatar in between that looks suspiciously like The Mage of St. Markovia from Episode 8—when Mike tells the final story in the finale.

“One more question…”; “We think it should be red”; “Your competitor says they can do it for free.”  
And then came the traffic. Ten kilometres in forty-five minutes on a suffocating Summer evening. Maddening.

“Sweety, aren't you sleepy?” he pleaded.  
“I am hungry,” she stared at him with round, hazel eyes, “Can I have a carrot?”  
“Alright, princess.” He hauled himself from the couch, made his way to the kitchen, and opened the fridge. The cool air graced his weary face. Down in the vegetable box, two tasty cans of his favourite IPAs winked. He closed his eyes, grabbed a carrot from the lot, and closed the fridge.

Talking about an app Im using but searching for alternatives, ideas","*(jump to the end of this post if you already know Dingplay and using the beta I'm talking about, stay here if you want to read then discuss about the problem we all encounter)*

I'm a french solo UI/UX designer in learning process, and a Flutter developer.

**I've built a mobile app to solve a problem I've noticed in many subreddits a month ago :**

**Finding people to play with, in a specific way (for games that offers multiple & different activities) IN REAL TIME.** Because yes, many subreddits exists only for sharing your platforms IDs/or friend codes if you're using Nintendo consoles. Or you can search for a game specific server on Discord. But the problem is the same :

Let's say you ask for people to play with you. **You have 3 major conditions to meet :**

\- It's better if you are in the same time zone  
\- People answer in a maximum of approximatively 15 min, otherwise you go for another activity or you're simply not available anymore.  
\- People are in the same mood and vibe than you, and you want to do the same activity in the specific game.

The problem with Reddit, Discord, or any other social network in general, is that, even when you download the corresponding mobile apps, and enable the notifications, these apps are so full of features and full of informations, that it can be overwhelming to check for that specific notification that show you the players's answers, even if they are really reactive.

So, i first checked out if there's an existing app and didn't found it by myself or even with AI, and that was curious because after i've developed my app, someone that joined my community talked about GamerLink but the interface wasnt friendly and has a subscription plan for all the main features (didnt verified yet but he described me the app like this.).

So I thought about the fact that I'll have only one competitor, and maybe I could play on the ""community"" side, a family vibe, even retro (I love retro and analogic design)

**SO here's a short description of my app, because I also leave here the google description because it's better written (not AI but got helped with translators because my english is not perfect for specific terms) :**

\- Register your IDs/Usernames corresponding to the platforms you want to use (Steam, Nintendo, Oculus, etc)

\- Create a specific game lobby and platforms (you have the 5 last nintendo platforms, modern consoles, PC, and even VR !) and specify the maximum desired number of players, and add a description so people already know what you want to do il the lobby.

\- Join existing game lobbies (it works like a social network feed but you can search for a specific game if existing), you press a button to ask the host before joining.

\- In the lobby, you'll see players and their corresponding IDs for the specific platform. You can add them to play later and invite them into your futures lobbies.

\- In-lobby chat, it's only text for the moment but I'll see if I create vocal chat or if people prefer to go in another platform to voice chat.

\- Your profile page, where you register your different IDs, your profile picture, and your 10 most played/favorites games atm (useful for notifications).

**Okay for the features, but what's the advantage over the other social networks ? NOTIFICATIONS :**

\- Get notified when someone's wants to join your lobby so he doesn't wait for hours.  
\- Get notified if the host accepted your request to join, so you click on the notification and see the lobby, chat etc instantly.  
\- Get notified when you received a new message (basic but wanted to mention)  
\- Get notified when a friend invite you to a lobby, this way you bypass the host authorization and join the action immediatly.  
\- the most useful notification : Get notified when someone create a lobby corresponding to one of your favorite games, so you don't miss any potential session.

**Furthermore, a massive feature upcoming :**

Not everyone but, most of the people that spend a huge amount of their time in video-games, above loving what they are playing, are introverts. I was introvert when I was a teenager, but it changed over time (and I think working on a bar for some time really change you ahah, but out of context.)

I also see and read many stories about people getting in love with distant people. That is sometimes cool and romantic, but It can be really frustrating, furthermore if you actually are a teenager.

**That's why I want to create a feature called Cross&Play :**

Using passive Bluetooth, your phone will yield your Username/or in-app ID, and, if you cross someone in the street using the app, your phone will get a notification and at the end of the day (not before, it's really important to avoid weird situations in the street), a new page will be available, to see all the people you came by during the day.

You'll see basic informations about the player (his username, his favorites games), but also a short description that was written by the user and only available for people that cross him/she of himself and a few things he/she likes in life, in general.

This could be a really good conversation start and maybe people could meet and have a coffee, and a good relationship !

This feature would be under extreme security rules (to avoid harrassment, kidnapping, etc), for example people would need to register their IDs cards only for security purpose so if there's any incident in the app or out of the app, the autorities would be able to gather the essential informations quickly enough. Furthermore, if a player is 25 years old, he would not be able to see informations about a player who is under 18.

But I really do think it could be a good feature for introverts.  
\-------------------------------------------------------------

**Price :**

# IT'S FREE

**Website, app download & more :**

So the app is actually in beta phase, available for Android users (I'm gathering 100 dollars so I can buy an Apple license and publish the beta for iOS users, I think I'll do that in 2 months).

We are 6 active users for the moment, for a total of 22 testers but I think not everyone has downloaded the app yet.

Most of the current users are playing 3ds & Switch games but personally I play every possible platforms (except Sony & Microsoft that I don't have)

I have good feedbacks for now, I've already corrected the biggest bugs, and now we just need more players because this app is based on the amount of the lobbies ahah.

**Here's the complete Google play app's description, with all the features :**

\-------------------------------------------------------------

""Find the best mates to play your way !

DingPlay helps you find the right people to play with, no matter the game or the platform.

Tired of jumping between servers, forums, and social networks just to find someone who plays the same game, on the same platform, with the same goals? DingPlay was built to make this simple, fast, and stress-free.

# Create or join game lobbies

Create a lobby for a specific game and platform, describe exactly what you want to do (casual, competitive, co-op, ranked, chill sessions, etc.), and let other players join you.  
You can also browse existing lobbies and instantly join players who match your expectations.

# Chat and connect easily

Each lobby comes with a built-in chat, allowing you to talk with players before and during your session.  
Once you’ve had a great game together, add players to your friends list and play again anytime.

# Favorite games & smart notifications

Add up to 10 of your favorite or most played games.  
Whenever someone creates a lobby for a game in your favorites list, you’ll receive a notification so you never miss a good opportunity to play.

# Stay informed

Get notified when:

* Someone wants to join your lobby
* Your invitation is accepted
* You receive new chat messages
* A new lobby is created for one of your favorite games

# Play without pressure

DingPlay is also perfect if you’re shy or uncomfortable joining large servers or social networks.  
Instead of searching and introducing yourself over and over again, DingPlay helps players find *you*, based on what you want to play and how you want to play.

No awkward introductions. No wasted time.  
Just launch DingPlay, find your mates, and enjoy your game.""",0,1767458507.0,Switch,0,0.5,False

1q2z85u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q2z85u,#conformitygate - What Next? - Netflix,"So I’ve gone way too deep into this Conformity Gate rabbit hole, and I’m trying to figure out if Netflix hid messages in the brand spot they dropped a couple of days before the final episode aired.

The spot barely explains anything, but if you pause/screenshot the glitch moments, there might be some Easter eggs hiding in there:

\- It starts with the protagonist of the spot looking a lot like Joyce, at a bus stop clearly branded for Stranger Things Season 5. When she hops on the bus, the interior lights flicker, feeling very upsidedown-coded

\- Appa scene: When Appa appears, there’s a kid in the top-left corner who looks a lot like Mike (could be Will too—hard to tell).

\- Second glitch: This one is much clearer and really looks like Eleven in the water tank.

\- Third glitch: A girl falling straight toward the camera. Possibly Holly? Or Max?

\- Bus scene: No red glitch here (aka Vecna’s eye?), but something feels off. The girl on the left has an “EST” tag on her ponytail. Then, at the bus stop, the main woman in the video (low-key looks like Joyce) takes a sip from a coffee cup that says “TIME”, with some numbers underneath that I can’t quite read. Might be connected to the EST tag… or might be nothing.

\- Tarot card glitch – The Moon:

The Moon symbolizes the subconscious, fear, illusion, and things hidden beneath the surface.

Which honestly fits Stranger Things perfectly—trauma, distorted reality, intuition over logic, etc.

\- Another glitch: There’s a death symbol at the bottom of the coffee cup, and a kid who looks a LOT like Dustin in Season 3.

\- Final scene: This might be a stretch, but in the last shot with the tarot reader and the text “What Next?”, there’s a toy/avatar in between that looks suspiciously like The Mage of St. Markovia from Episode 8—when Mike tells the final story in the finale.

I might be completely overthinking this, but curious if anyone else spotted more details or got clearer screenshots.",20,1767458494.0,byler,5,0.91,False

At this time of year, when cycles close and new ones open, it's a good moment to reflect on the energy that keeps complex systems alive. I've been reminded recently that generosity is a form of positive feedback, essential for any project to evolve and maintain its dissipative structure far from static equilibrium.

Throughout this year, I've devoted my efforts to deepening the **fractal-holographic model** (or holofractal model) and to rigorously applying the **holofractic method** to weave bridges between science, art, and philosophy. As you know, whether under my artistic signature of Alejandro Troyán or in my researcher capacity (Juan José López Ruiz), the goal is always the same: to find that underlying unity in diversity, that **holofractal methodology** that allows us to see the whole in the part.

Creating content, researching, and developing this vision requires a constant investment of time and vital energy. That's why, if my work has resonated with you, made you think, or simply offered you a new perspective on reality, I invite you to support the continuity of this project.

The *Buy Me a Coffee* platform reminds us that visible support is fundamental. It's not just a donation; it's an exchange of energy that validates the path and allows us to continue exploring the boundaries of aesthetics and knowledge.

If you wish to contribute to keeping this vision expanding, you can buy me a coffee here:

☕ [BUY ME A COFFE](http://buymeacoffee.com/holofractig)

Thank you for being part of this system, for your resonance, and for allowing the vision to continue growing. The beauty of giving and receiving is, in itself, a holofractal dynamic.

Nah.

So I opened VS Code, grabbed some coffee, and decided to build my own pipeline.

**The Workflow (The Vibe):** I didn't want to overcomplicate it. I just wanted to chain a few powerful models together and let them do the work.

1. **The Ears (Whisper):** Runs locally. Takes the video and gives me word-level timestamps.
2. **The Brain (Gemini 2.5 Flash):** I feed the transcript to Gemini with a specific system prompt: *""You are a viral video editor. Find the best hook.""* It returns the exact start/end times in JSON.
3. **The Hands (MoviePy v2):** This was the only part that broke my flow (v2 has crazy breaking changes), but once fixed, it auto-crops to 9:16 and burns those karaoke-style subtitles we all love/hate.

**The Result:** A completely automated ""OpusClip Killer"" that runs on my machine for free (using Gemini's free tier).

It feels illegal to have this much power in a simple Python script.

**Code & Demo:** If you want to see the code or fork it to add your own vibes (maybe add a local LLM instead of Gemini?):

I am a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a female colleague who was 50, four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We would chat and go to lunch together, sometimes with other colleagues. She would also bring me homemade dishes because she knew I enjoyed good food. Sometimes she would give me cakes and snacks; I felt she was almost like a big sister. Occasionally, she acted childishly around me—for instance, one day she ran toward me to talk to me like a child, and she would tease me during our discussions. Every time a workplace meal was organized for a celebration, she insisted I participate, even though I don’t typically enjoy work social events. Afterward, she would become colder and more distant. Sometimes she would ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to run some errands. She often suggested outings with the children, but I systematically refused because I had no desire to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management—a kind of harassment that was very difficult for me. For several months, I didn’t speak to anyone at work, focusing only on my tasks and trying to get through that tough period. This colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and I simply replied, ""I have a lot of work,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her by chance on the metro, and she came over to me, suggesting we travel together. She behaved in a way I would describe as flirting (she got very close to me, pressed her chest against my arm, and leaned in very close to speak to me). One day, she even came into my office to look at something on my screen and stood very close against me. I didn't know how to react because she is older, and I was quite surprised.

I eventually found another job in a different office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me, asked when my last day was, and said she was inviting me to lunch that day. On the day, she took me out and asked if she had done something wrong and why I wasn't speaking to her anymore. I explained that I had been suffering from harassment and had been looking for another job, which I had found.

She was relieved that my distant attitude wasn't because of her. She then continued to make flirting gestures, such as touching my hand. I then told her that since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in touch and see each other for family outings with the children and spouses (this might have been a mistake on my part!). Delighted, she organized several outings during the summer, and we saw each other regularly—always with our respective spouses at my request, as I didn't want us to meet without her husband and my wife. I thought our relationship was great. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my children and didn't tell her, she would point it out: ""You didn't call me, that's not nice."" Yet, it was her choice, and frankly, I didn't care. She also started criticizing her husband, saying he doesn't invest himself, that he just sits at home drinking coffee, and that he is old. When I asked her how they met, she told me he was the one who hit on her and that she wasn't interested at first because he was unemployed at the time. In short, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series for her and put them on a USB stick—something her husband could have done.

She had promised to show me a cooking recipe. I suggested she come to the house with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal as a group. But one day, after an outing with her son and mine (exceptionally without the spouses), she said, ""Let's meet at your place for the recipe."" Okay, so once we arrived at my house, I thought we would chat over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking all by herself and did the dishes without saying a word. It was very bizarre. Then she said, ""The meal is ready, I have to go now."" She left the premises without even having a conversation. In my opinion, it was a truly strange scene.

She had planned to go on a trip to Spain with her family; I told her I knew that country well and preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family instead. I found that weird.

She began organizing outings with both families herself—booking hotels, suggesting hikes, barbecues, and meals at home, or outings with the children to the pool, etc. She even wanted our two families to go abroad together or to a mountain chalet. She also suggested organizing a ""girls' trip"" for her and my mother to a spa. Then, after about ten intense outings and several dinner invitations at each other's homes, she suddenly stopped giving any news. Just like that. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot... One day, her husband was supposed to help me assemble furniture—a plan made weeks in advance—and on the day of, he bailed on me. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I went to pick him up by car, he said to me in the auto during the trip: ""If she wants us to separate, no problem."" I didn't understand that comment.

Then, no more news at all... I wrote to her several times to see if everything was okay, and she replied briefly. I then sent New Year's greetings to her husband, but got no response. She had promised to give me contacts for renovation companies, which she never did.

I finally confronted her via SMS several months later, after hearing nothing... I asked her why they had disappeared and why she hadn't given me the promised renovation information. She wrote back saying she was on vacation. I wrote to her: ""The two of you disappeared without giving us the promised contacts; you are users (profiteurs)."" She then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then replied with something like: ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and concluded: ""This is where our relationship ends.""

We have a halal relationship and are waiting for marriage. I live in a European country, and he came here to study. He is from Palestine. His parents came to visit recently, and we met briefly, but it wasn’t planned. He was too nervous to tell them he wanted to meet me, so he just asked me to come to where they were, and we met.

They were very kind, but it was a short meeting (less than 10 minutes).

He has met and knows my parents. My parents told him to his parents if they would like to have coffee with all of us to get to know each other, but he was too nervous to do so. He says that in his culture, parents meet only when the hand of the woman is formally requested for marriage.

Besides that short meeting, I haven’t met his parents again, and I feel unsure about what to believe. I asked him to invite them to coffee so we could get to know each other, but he said it isn’t possible because, in his culture, parents don’t meet the partner before marriage. I’m not sure if this is entirely true.

Every summer he goes to Palestine to visit his family, but I haven’t been able to go with him. He explained that I cannot visit his parents’ home because we are not married. I find this difficult to understand, because how can his parents get to know me if we cannot meet? I have even started learning Arabic and reading the Quran, because I am serious about this relationship and want to marry him. I want to feel part of his family, but he insists it is not possible yet.

He is very nervous about his traditional parents and can barely talk to them about our relationship. He says this is normal in his culture. However, when I met them, they seemed warm and welcoming; both his mother and father smiled and made me feel comfortable.

I am also worried that his parents might not accept me as his future wife, since they do not know me well yet. My parents are strict, while his are more traditional. My parents would never let me meet a man without first knowing him. My parents are very welcoming to him, and he is fully part of my family, but with his family, it feels like I am invisible until marriage.

He also said that his parents cannot know that he met my parents because it is considered improper to meet before formally requesting marriage.

Everything about this situation is new and unfamiliar to me. I just want to ensure that we will be able to get married after university. Our relationship has been fully halal: I have never visited his home alone, and we maintain appropriate boundaries.

I am concerned about whether his parents will accept him marrying me. But at the same time, if they had serious objections, I think they might have advised him to end the relationship after meeting me. Am I right?

I would really appreciate any advice.

1q2yxhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/1q2yxhe/how_do_you_find_people_to_play_with_rapidly/,"How do you find people to play with rapidly ?  Talking about an app Im using but searching for alternatives, ideas","*(jump to the end of this post if you already know Dingplay and using the beta I'm talking about, stay here if you want to read then discuss about the problem we all encounter)*

I'm a french solo UI/UX designer in learning process, and a Flutter developer.

**I've built a mobile app to solve a problem I've noticed in many subreddits a month ago :**

**Finding people to play with, in a specific way (for games that offers multiple & different activities) IN REAL TIME.** Because yes, many subreddits exists only for sharing your platforms IDs/or friend codes if you're using Nintendo consoles. Or you can search for a game specific server on Discord. But the problem is the same :

Let's say you ask for people to play with you. **You have 3 major conditions to meet :**

\- It's better if you are in the same time zone  
\- People answer in a maximum of approximatively 15 min, otherwise you go for another activity or you're simply not available anymore.  
\- People are in the same mood and vibe than you, and you want to do the same activity in the specific game.

The problem with Reddit, Discord, or any other social network in general, is that, even when you download the corresponding mobile apps, and enable the notifications, these apps are so full of features and full of informations, that it can be overwhelming to check for that specific notification that show you the players's answers, even if they are really reactive.

So, i first checked out if there's an existing app and didn't found it by myself or even with AI, and that was curious because after i've developed my app, someone that joined my community talked about GamerLink but the interface wasnt friendly and has a subscription plan for all the main features (didnt verified yet but he described me the app like this.).

So I thought about the fact that I'll have only one competitor, and maybe I could play on the ""community"" side, a family vibe, even retro (I love retro and analogic design)

**SO here's a short description of my app, because I also leave here the google description because it's better written (not AI but got helped with translators because my english is not perfect for specific terms) :**

\- Register your IDs/Usernames corresponding to the platforms you want to use (Steam, Nintendo, Oculus, etc)

\- Create a specific game lobby and platforms (you have the 5 last nintendo platforms, modern consoles, PC, and even VR !) and specify the maximum desired number of players, and add a description so people already know what you want to do il the lobby.

\- Join existing game lobbies (it works like a social network feed but you can search for a specific game if existing), you press a button to ask the host before joining.

\- In the lobby, you'll see players and their corresponding IDs for the specific platform. You can add them to play later and invite them into your futures lobbies.

\- In-lobby chat, it's only text for the moment but I'll see if I create vocal chat or if people prefer to go in another platform to voice chat.

\- Your profile page, where you register your different IDs, your profile picture, and your 10 most played/favorites games atm (useful for notifications).

**Okay for the features, but what's the advantage over the other social networks ? NOTIFICATIONS :**

\- Get notified when someone's wants to join your lobby so he doesn't wait for hours.  
\- Get notified if the host accepted your request to join, so you click on the notification and see the lobby, chat etc instantly.  
\- Get notified when you received a new message (basic but wanted to mention)  
\- Get notified when a friend invite you to a lobby, this way you bypass the host authorization and join the action immediatly.  
\- the most useful notification : Get notified when someone create a lobby corresponding to one of your favorite games, so you don't miss any potential session.

**Furthermore, a massive feature upcoming :**

Not everyone but, most of the people that spend a huge amount of their time in video-games, above loving what they are playing, are introverts. I was introvert when I was a teenager, but it changed over time (and I think working on a bar for some time really change you ahah, but out of context.)

I also see and read many stories about people getting in love with distant people. That is sometimes cool and romantic, but It can be really frustrating, furthermore if you actually are a teenager.

**That's why I want to create a feature called Cross&Play :**

Using passive Bluetooth, your phone will yield your Username/or in-app ID, and, if you cross someone in the street using the app, your phone will get a notification and at the end of the day (not before, it's really important to avoid weird situations in the street), a new page will be available, to see all the people you came by during the day.

You'll see basic informations about the player (his username, his favorites games), but also a short description that was written by the user and only available for people that cross him/she of himself and a few things he/she likes in life, in general.

This could be a really good conversation start and maybe people could meet and have a coffee, and a good relationship !

This feature would be under extreme security rules (to avoid harrassment, kidnapping, etc), for example people would need to register their IDs cards only for security purpose so if there's any incident in the app or out of the app, the autorities would be able to gather the essential informations quickly enough. Furthermore, if a player is 25 years old, he would not be able to see informations about a player who is under 18.

But I really do think it could be a good feature for introverts.  
\-------------------------------------------------------------

**Price :**

# IT'S FREE

**Website, app download & more :**

So the app is actually in beta phase, available for Android users (I'm gathering 100 dollars so I can buy an Apple license and publish the beta for iOS users, I think I'll do that in 2 months).

We are 6 active users for the moment, for a total of 22 testers but I think not everyone has downloaded the app yet.

Most of the current users are playing 3ds & Switch games but personally I play every possible platforms (except Sony & Microsoft that I don't have)

I have good feedbacks for now, I've already corrected the biggest bugs, and now we just need more players because this app is based on the amount of the lobbies ahah.

# So if you want to join the adventure, here's the website for the app : [https://www.dingplay.net/](https://www.dingplay.net/)

**Here's the complete Google play app's description, with all the features :**

\-------------------------------------------------------------

""Find the best mates to play your way !

DingPlay helps you find the right people to play with, no matter the game or the platform.

Tired of jumping between servers, forums, and social networks just to find someone who plays the same game, on the same platform, with the same goals? DingPlay was built to make this simple, fast, and stress-free.

# Create or join game lobbies

Create a lobby for a specific game and platform, describe exactly what you want to do (casual, competitive, co-op, ranked, chill sessions, etc.), and let other players join you.  
You can also browse existing lobbies and instantly join players who match your expectations.

# Chat and connect easily

Each lobby comes with a built-in chat, allowing you to talk with players before and during your session.  
Once you’ve had a great game together, add players to your friends list and play again anytime.

# Favorite games & smart notifications

Add up to 10 of your favorite or most played games.  
Whenever someone creates a lobby for a game in your favorites list, you’ll receive a notification so you never miss a good opportunity to play.

# Stay informed

Get notified when:

* Someone wants to join your lobby
* Your invitation is accepted
* You receive new chat messages
* A new lobby is created for one of your favorite games

# Play without pressure

DingPlay is also perfect if you’re shy or uncomfortable joining large servers or social networks.  
Instead of searching and introducing yourself over and over again, DingPlay helps players find *you*, based on what you want to play and how you want to play.

No awkward introductions. No wasted time.  
Just launch DingPlay, find your mates, and enjoy your game.""",2,1767457813.0,wiiu,0,0.76,False
1q2yxby,https://www.reddit.com/r/MexicoCity/comments/1q2yxby/tips_after_firsttime_visit/,tips after first-time visit,"I recently returned from my first visit to CDMX, which was a great experience. I learned so much from previous posts, so I'm sharing some of my tips and takeaways from my visit. These are of course subjective opinions from an American tourist :)

---

eSIM: I purchased an eSIM from **AT&T GO** of the Mexican AT&T service (https://www.att.com.mx/planes/prepago/att-go/). The cheapest package is 6.5 GB for 30 days at 150 MXN ($8.4 USD). At roughly $1.3 USD/GB, it’s great value (cheaper eSIM options are unreliable, and established services are more expensive). And it comes with unlimited phone and text service with a Mexican phone number assigned. I didn’t need that much data during my weeklong stay, but I appreciated having more than enough data. Speed is capped at LTE (4G), but it was sufficient for my travel needs, and I had good coverage throughout CDMX. I purchased it before traveling and activated it using the QR code once I landed. Seamless experience. For a more comprehensive guide to cell service in Mexico, refer to this excellent Reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/NoContract/comments/1egkvl9/cell_phone_service_in_mexico_quick_reference/.

Rideshare: I highly recommend using the **DiDi app**. Rides on it are generally cheaper than on Uber, which I try to  avoid using when possible. I was always able to find a car very quickly, and you can also pay using cash if desired.

Teotihuacan: I followed other Redditors’ advice and took the bus from **Central de Autobuses del Norte** (Northern Bus Station) to piramides/Zona Arqueologica. You can buy a roundtrip ticket for 150 MXN (cash only) at the booth by Gate 8. The buses depart every 15 minutes, so no need to time it. On our way back from Teotihuacan (drop-off and pick-up are both at Puerta 2), we got on a bus only to find that all of the seats were taken and that we would need to stand for an hour. We just waited for the next bus, which arrived in less than 10 minutes. Some buses run direct, while others make a few stops (Ecatepec 30-30; Metro 18 de Marzo; Metro Indios Verdes; Central del Norte). We decided to get off at the Metro 18 de Marzo stop, which is within walking distance from the Basilica of Guadalupe. (I would highly recommend visiting it regardless of your faith. It’s the 3rd most visited religious site in the world and the most visited Catholic one.) Teotihuacan entry tickets are 100 MXN, which means the whole visit cost 250 MXN ($14 USD). I didn’t think a guided tour was worth it; there are signs in English throughout the site, and you can learn about it on Wikipedia and at the National Anthropology Museum. The site is huge, so I appreciated being able to take my time and not being rushed by a tour group. There are plenty of restaurants right outside of the site to eat lunch afterwards. I would definitely pack water and snacks, as well as a hat and sunscreen.

Museums: The museum that I enjoyed the most was the **Museo de Arte Moderno**. Manageably sized and well curated, it is almost exclusively dedicated to modern Mexican art. It puts well-known figures like Kahlo and Rivera alongside their contemporaries like Tamayo, Orozco, Siqueiros, Rufino, and Remedios Varo (huge collection of her incredible art!). There’s also a peaceful sculpture garden behind the museum. The other art museums were good but not great. Soumaya covers hundreds years of European art (cool Roudin collection on the top floor), which I found unwieldy; but it’s free and is housed in a cool building. Tamayo had one interesting exhibition but the rest were underwhelming; but it’s in a beautiful brutalist building. Moderno and Tamayo are both free on Sundays to all visitors (not all places offer free Sunday admissions to tourists). The National Palace ran out of tickets by 10:30am when we went, so we could not visit it. However, I would highly recommend the nearby Museo Vivo del Muralismo, which is free and housed inside the Secretary of Education building; there are many Rivera murals throughout the building, which has open-air courtyards and is relaxing to walk around. Palacio de Bellas Artes was nice. The National Anthropology Museum is extremely thorough but cannot be reasonably consumed in one day. I would be selective about which exhibitions/rooms you want to focus on. I could only manage a half-day there. We couldn’t get tickets to Casa Azul, but the Museo Casa Estudio of Rivera and Kahlo was interesting. I wanted to check out the MUAC at UNAM but it was closed during our visit.

Food: We did not go to any of the fine-dining places but generally found the upper-middle tier of touristy places like Contramar, Azul, El Cardenal, and Cafe Tacuba underwhelming (which I should have expected). If anything, I would go for coffee, pastries, and dessert to enjoy the ambiance (San Angel Inn was best enjoyed sitting in the courtyard and sipping refreshing drinks). Cheaper meals were more memorable. **Maizajo** was an exception and was worth the wait. We made it without stomach issues; we were careful about what we drank and ate, though I did eat all of the fresh vegetable garnishes (onion, cilantro, tomato) and various salsas and pickled vegetables at casual places. We didn’t have time for a food tour, but I’ve been recommended them by friends. Great pastries and coffee in general! Definitely try atole or champurrado wherever available.

Lucha Libre: I would highly recommend going to a match during your visit! We bought tickets a week or two before using Ticketmaster for about $10 USD/person for the Friday show at **Arena Mexico**. We got to see some famous luchadores when we went, and the crowd energy is unmatched. Absolutely worthwhile experience (and I’m not a big sports person at all!).

Hope this is useful for other visitors!",17,1767457805.0,MexicoCity,6,0.76,False

They bought it in the late 70s, so it’s about 45 years old now. It’s been through kids, pets, spilled drinks, furniture being dragged across it, and who knows how many vacuum passes.

What surprised me is how well it’s held up. The colors are a little softer than they used to be, but there are no bald spots, no fraying at the edges, and it still feels thick under your feet. We’ve had it professionally cleaned a handful of times over the decades, but otherwise it’s just been used normally, nothing fancy.

It really made me think about how some things were just made differently back then. This rug has outlived multiple couches, coffee tables, and even the house it originally sat in. Nowadays it feels like most rugs are basically disposable after a few years.

1q2yvgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtHistory/comments/1q2yvgo/art_history_careers_for_someone_who_doesnt_care/,Art History Careers for Someone Who Doesn’t Care About Their Career,"Hi! I’m a student more or less at the beginning of my education (starting a bit later than I’d intended, but that’s beside the point), and since I first developed a passion for art history, I have, at various points, decided it would be prudent to get some idea of what I’d actually do with this degree once I have it. This sub has been a pretty useful resource in that regard, as there are a lot of threads in here asking some version of “What Job Will My Art History Degree Get Me?” The responses are always good—very helpful, very pragmatic, very practical—and are also usually some variation on “whatever job you can get that makes you the most money and provides the most opportunity for advancement.” Which, again, is good advice. That’s the kind of advice people are usually looking for when they ask that sort of question.

Just for fun, though, let’s say you were to imagine an individual who was something of a failure to launch, returning to higher education in their late twenties, with few passions and absolutely no ambitions in life outside of studying art history, who also really doesn’t have much interest in things like “earning a comfortable wage,” or “starting a family,” or“retiring someday,” or “having disposable income.” What kind of jobs could you see an art history major fitting that description landing in?

Aside from, you know, retail. The hypothetical individual I’ve described here is passionate enough about art history that they would still pursue their education in the subject at all costs even if they knew with absolute certainty that the only employment they’d be able to find with the degree was making coffee. However, art history is essentially their sole joy in life, and they would prefer to end up doing something at least adjacent to the field, if possible.",6,1767457688.0,ArtHistory,6,0.75,False

*(jump to the end of this post if you already know Dingplay and using the beta I'm talking about, stay here if you want to read then discuss about the problem we all encounter)*

I'm a french solo UI/UX designer in learning process, and a Flutter developer.

**I've built a mobile app to solve a problem I've noticed in many subreddits a month ago :**

**Finding people to play with, in a specific way (for games that offers multiple & different activities) IN REAL TIME.** Because yes, many subreddits exists only for sharing your platforms IDs/or friend codes if you're using Nintendo consoles. Or you can search for a game specific server on Discord. But the problem is the same :

Let's say you ask for people to play with you. **You have 3 major conditions to meet :**

\- It's better if you are in the same time zone  
\- People answer in a maximum of approximatively 15 min, otherwise you go for another activity or you're simply not available anymore.  
\- People are in the same mood and vibe than you, and you want to do the same activity in the specific game.

The problem with Reddit, Discord, or any other social network in general, is that, even when you download the corresponding mobile apps, and enable the notifications, these apps are so full of features and full of informations, that it can be overwhelming to check for that specific notification that show you the players's answers, even if they are really reactive.

So, i first checked out if there's an existing app and didn't found it by myself or even with AI, and that was curious because after i've developed my app, someone that joined my community talked about GamerLink but the interface wasnt friendly and has a subscription plan for all the main features (didnt verified yet but he described me the app like this.).

So I thought about the fact that I'll have only one competitor, and maybe I could play on the ""community"" side, a family vibe, even retro (I love retro and analogic design)

**SO here's a short description of my app, because I also leave here the google description because it's better written (not AI but got helped with translators because my english is not perfect for specific terms) :**

\- Register your IDs/Usernames corresponding to the platforms you want to use (Steam, Nintendo, Oculus, etc)

\- Create a specific game lobby and platforms (you have the 5 last nintendo platforms, modern consoles, PC, and even VR !) and specify the maximum desired number of players, and add a description so people already know what you want to do il the lobby.

\- Join existing game lobbies (it works like a social network feed but you can search for a specific game if existing), you press a button to ask the host before joining.

\- In the lobby, you'll see players and their corresponding IDs for the specific platform. You can add them to play later and invite them into your futures lobbies.

\- In-lobby chat, it's only text for the moment but I'll see if I create vocal chat or if people prefer to go in another platform to voice chat.

\- Your profile page, where you register your different IDs, your profile picture, and your 10 most played/favorites games atm (useful for notifications).

**Okay for the features, but what's the advantage over the other social networks ? NOTIFICATIONS :**

\- Get notified when someone's wants to join your lobby so he doesn't wait for hours.  
\- Get notified if the host accepted your request to join, so you click on the notification and see the lobby, chat etc instantly.  
\- Get notified when you received a new message (basic but wanted to mention)  
\- Get notified when a friend invite you to a lobby, this way you bypass the host authorization and join the action immediatly.  
\- the most useful notification : Get notified when someone create a lobby corresponding to one of your favorite games, so you don't miss any potential session.

**Furthermore, a massive feature upcoming :**

Not everyone but, most of the people that spend a huge amount of their time in video-games, above loving what they are playing, are introverts. I was introvert when I was a teenager, but it changed over time (and I think working on a bar for some time really change you ahah, but out of context.)

I also see and read many stories about people getting in love with distant people. That is sometimes cool and romantic, but It can be really frustrating, furthermore if you actually are a teenager.

**That's why I want to create a feature called Cross&Play :**

Using passive Bluetooth, your phone will yield your Username/or in-app ID, and, if you cross someone in the street using the app, your phone will get a notification and at the end of the day (not before, it's really important to avoid weird situations in the street), a new page will be available, to see all the people you came by during the day.

You'll see basic informations about the player (his username, his favorites games), but also a short description that was written by the user and only available for people that cross him/she of himself and a few things he/she likes in life, in general.

This could be a really good conversation start and maybe people could meet and have a coffee, and a good relationship !

This feature would be under extreme security rules (to avoid harrassment, kidnapping, etc), for example people would need to register their IDs cards only for security purpose so if there's any incident in the app or out of the app, the autorities would be able to gather the essential informations quickly enough. Furthermore, if a player is 25 years old, he would not be able to see informations about a player who is under 18.

But I really do think it could be a good feature for introverts.

Ive been researching here for a little bit and I've learned its a 3 year program with a bachelor of science degree at the end. I do have a few questions however:

1. is it possible to work as a paramedic in Ireland if you don't possess Irish citizenship? 

2. Whats the relationship between the residency permits and job obtainment? I've read some conflicting statements that say that you need residency before occupation or something like that?

3. i possess a bachelor of science in premedical/biology already, a 4 year program from an internationally accredited college, will this have any affect on courses within the program or absolutely nothing? (i assume nothing cause USA college vs Ireland college)

4. is there a pathway, per say if i wanted to obtain an MD after working as a paramedic for a bit? I've been in in talks with the royal college of health and surgeons about attending since 2023, if i work as a paramedic first over there, is a route to take to shift to in hospital from out of hospital?

5. lets say all goes well, and i become a paramedic, what would be good spots for residency? i know Dublin's a bit of a residential hell at the moment, what would be good cities to search? (in the event nothing changes in 3 years)

1q2yqpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1q2yqpm/back_to_school_advice_for_newer_teachers/,Back to school - Advice for newer teachers,"With the return of school in a couple days I thought I'd offer some advice for newer teachers. Some of you might not agree with everything I write, but I have found that it works for me. 

My background: I am currently in my 9th year and teaching middle years (grade 7) at a wealthier school. However, I have also worked in inner-city community schools as a release teacher and as a high school teacher. My experience has revealed to me that the current age group I teach (12-14) is the one that suits my style best. The following advice is specific to middle years but could work in every classroom with some tweaking.


1) First impressions matter. Humans inherently give more respect to people who look worthy of it. Dress up not down. 
A collared shirt with fitted pants and decent shoes for men.  Do not wear jeans or shorts, or flip flops. For high school teachers, do not dress like the students do. Simple. 

2) Be a mystery to them. You can share a few things about your life, but in order for them to respect you, you need to be seen as an adult. An adult who lives in an adult world. This is mysterious to children and should be kept as such. Don't tell them about your dating life, your plans for the weekend, etc. A few minor details is all (for example, I'm going on a trip this summer). I hate to break it to you, but kids don't care! You're still a boring adult to them, even if they like you as a teacher. 

3) Be organized! I still cannot believe how many classrooms I walk into and witness a teacher's desk and area just swarming with papers, files, coffee cups, wires, etc. It looks like absolute chaos. How can you expect students to be organized and keep their area clean when you can't? I can already hear some answers: it's just who I am and how I work. Well, then fix it. You're in the business of moulding young minds and habits so take care of your own, too. Don't be a hypocrite.

Now, what does an organized class look like?

-Clean. 

-Very few things on the wall that are not related to class content. 

-Colour coordinated filings for each class. 

-A specific place where students hand back and pickup assignments.

-A calendar with the weekly happenings of the school and classroom. 

-A daily plan with each subject and time visible to the students.

-A few real plants to add colour. 

Make the class inviting but also clean and orderly!

4) Be predictable and consistent! I always see people posting this advice here. But what does it mean, exactly? 

Children, like adults, thrive when there is predictability and consistency. As other veteran teachers will tell you, the longest and most problematic days in a school are the ones with special events, pep rallies, etc. Anything that detracts from a normal day affects the predictability and flow. Kids can't handle it and become deregulated. So, what can be done on normal days? (just have to face facts that unless you have a school culture of quiet in the hallways and during assemblies, students will become deregulated if they leave the room for an event).

Here are some little things I use day-to-day:

-To reduce blurting and shouting out answers, here is what I have noticed helps me (remember you have to be consistent and should start doing this from the onset of the year). A simple switch of your language is all it takes.  Instead of ""who can tell me the answer to number 3?""

Say, ""by raising their hand, who can tell the class their answer to number 3?"" A slight change of the wording that reminds kids to raise their hands first. I'm telling you, it works.

-Go over the day plan (remember to have each period of the day is visible at the front of the room). Kids will notice slight changes. For example, if it's a Tuesday and I've switched health for Science they will notice. Why? Because they've come to expect something else and they thrive on predictability. Even a small change can throw them off. 

-Before each lesson (in high school) or subject change in elementary: start with a 20 second explanation of what you will be doing for that specific 30, 45 or 60 minutes. For example, ""today in health we will start with a short reading on peer pressure. Afterwards we will be taking some notes and having a class discussion. To finish up you will be writing a reflection"". You can write this on the board as well to help even more.

-Do not yell or scream at them. 
Obviously, we all have our moments where it's just too much and you think it will help. It won't. You are steering the ship. You are in control. 

Take a deep breath and remain calm. Stand at the front and stare, or have a bemused look on your face. Some kids will eventually notice and they will regulate each other. Some classes will take longer than others. But with consistency, this will work and kids will regulate. Once a room is quiet, kids realize that they actually enjoy a quiet room.

5)Work on transitions and be strict:

-Practice makes perfect. If you have a large block, let's say 90 minutes, and you have 2 lessons from 2 different subjects. Ensure the students are able to make the switch without getting up, without talking, and without shuffling too much. Like anything, this takes practice at the beginning of the year. I drill it in for months so as to have a smooth year.

-Leaving the room- if you take your class to the gym or library or whatever, line them up and DO NOT leave the classroom until there is complete silence. If so much as one student misbehaves in the hallway (i.e. runs or talks or breaks any of your rules) turn around and go back to class. Do this over and over until the class meets your expectations. Once again, this saves you so much time and energy later in the year. 

I have the same group I had in September. What are we doing on Monday, January 5? Going over the exact same expectations and rules we went over in September. 2 weeks is a long break for kids, so to make my life easier, we will continue to drill in expectations as it it's September. I will do this until they are self-sufficient. Obviously, this will only take days instead of weeks the second time around.

1q2yp9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/1q2yp9j/back_to_school_heres_some_advice_for_younger/,Back to school - Here's some advice for younger teachers,"With the return of school in a couple days I thought I'd offer some advice for newer teachers. Some of you might not agree with everything I write, but I have found that it works for me. 

My background: I am currently in my 9th year and teaching middle years (grade 7) at a wealthier school. However, I have also worked in inner-city community schools as a release teacher and as a high school teacher. My experience has revealed to me that the current age group I teach (12-14) is the one that suits my style best. The following advice is specific to middle years but could work in every classroom with some tweaking.


1) First impressions matter. Humans inherently give more respect to people who look worthy of it. Dress up not down. 
A collared shirt with fitted pants and decent shoes for men.  Do not wear jeans or shorts, or flip flops. For high school teachers, do not dress like the students do. Simple. 

2) Be a mystery to them. You can share a few things about your life, but in order for them to respect you, you need to be seen as an adult. An adult who lives in an adult world. This is mysterious to children and should be kept as such. Don't tell them about your dating life, your plans for the weekend, etc. A few minor details is all (for example, I'm going on a trip this summer). I hate to break it to you, but kids don't care! You're still a boring adult to them, even if they like you as a teacher. 

3) Be organized! I still cannot believe how many classrooms I walk into and witness a teacher's desk and area just swarming with papers, files, coffee cups, wires, etc. It looks like absolute chaos. How can you expect students to be organized and keep their area clean when you can't? I can already hear some answers: it's just who I am and how I work. Well, then fix it. You're in the business of moulding young minds and habits so take care of your own, too. Don't be a hypocrite.

Now, what does an organized class look like?

-Clean. 

-Very few things on the wall that are not related to class content. 

-Colour coordinated filings for each class. 

-A specific place where students hand back and pickup assignments.

-A calendar with the weekly happenings of the school and classroom. 

-A daily plan with each subject and time visible to the students.

-A few real plants to add colour. 

Make the class inviting but also clean and orderly!

4) Be predictable and consistent! I always see people posting this advice here. But what does it mean, exactly? 

Children, like adults, thrive when there is predictability and consistency. As other veteran teachers will tell you, the longest and most problematic days in a school are the ones with special events, pep rallies, etc. Anything that detracts from a normal day affects the predictability and flow. Kids can't handle it and become deregulated. So, what can be done on normal days? (just have to face facts that unless you have a school culture of quiet in the hallways and during assemblies, students will become deregulated if they leave the room for an event).

Here are some little things I use day-to-day:

-To reduce blurting and shouting out answers, here is what I have noticed helps me (remember you have to be consistent and should start doing this from the onset of the year). A simple switch of your language is all it takes.  Instead of ""who can tell me the answer to number 3?""

Say, ""by raising their hand, who can tell the class their answer to number 3?"" A slight change of the wording that reminds kids to raise their hands first. I'm telling you, it works.

-Go over the day plan (remember to have each period of the day is visible at the front of the room). Kids will notice slight changes. For example, if it's a Tuesday and I've switched health for Science they will notice. Why? Because they've come to expect something else and they thrive on predictability. Even a small change can throw them off. 

-Before each lesson (in high school) or subject change in elementary: start with a 20 second explanation of what you will be doing for that specific 30, 45 or 60 minutes. For example, ""today in health we will start with a short reading on peer pressure. Afterwards we will be taking some notes and having a class discussion. To finish up you will be writing a reflection"". You can write this on the board as well to help even more.

-Do not yell or scream at them. 
Obviously, we all have our moments where it's just too much and you think it will help. It won't. You are steering the ship. You are in control. 

Take a deep breath and remain calm. Stand at the front and stare, or have a bemused look on your face. Some kids will eventually notice and they will regulate each other. Some classes will take longer than others. But with consistency, this will work and kids will regulate. Once a room is quiet, kids realize that they actually enjoy a quiet room.

5)Work on transitions and be strict:

-Practice makes perfect. If you have a large block, let's say 90 minutes, and you have 2 lessons from 2 different subjects. Ensure the students are able to make the switch without getting up, without talking, and without shuffling too much. Like anything, this takes practice at the beginning of the year. I drill it in for months so as to have a smooth year.

-Leaving the room- if you take your class to the gym or library or whatever, line them up and DO NOT leave the classroom until there is complete silence. If so much as one student misbehaves in the hallway (i.e. runs or talks or breaks any of your rules) turn around and go back to class. Do this over and over until the class meets your expectations. Once again, this saves you so much time and energy later in the year. 

I have the same group I had in September. What are we doing on Monday, January 5? Going over the exact same expectations and rules we went over in September. 2 weeks is a long break for kids, so to make my life easier, we will continue to drill in expectations as it it's September. I will do this until they are self-sufficient. Obviously, this will only take days instead of weeks the second time around.

Barely celebrating my bday this morning and this cold-rainy weather is making me wanna stay in all day! But, I’m still gonna try to get out and do some stuff! 

Speaking of which, I’d love to connect with someone equally interesting, chill, easy going, intelligent and kind. Can’t lie, I find myself super attracted to the shy, needy and very romantic type of women at times… then again, the whole crazy (in a good way) and outgoing type drives insane haha. At any rate, I’m only hoping to make a new friend, bestie, or even an online gf ;) no pressure. 

By the way, how was your Xmas and new year? Hope you had a great time and lots of fun! Any new year resolutions yet aside from committing to the gym and all… haha! Speaking of which, I can be your workout partner or motivational coach.. or the other way around haha. 

I’m off to making me some fresh and delicious cup of Italian coffee and would love to hear from you! 

You can send me a bday present or so, but I think I’ll be super excited with just a sweet wish! Haha. 

Cheers 

Your tall tanned and handsome bestie

1q2ynp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1q2ynp8/how_to_deal_with_a_class_that_lost_a_student_over/,How to deal with a class that lost a student over the Xmas vacation?,"Hey, first time poster on this subreddit.

Context:

I teach 10th grade math, and tragically, over the vacation, one of our students passed away, due to a tragic accident (some people may guess, it involved fire, and wasn't in the US). With the kids going back to school on Monday, I have them in 3rd and 4th periods in the morning.

The school has already called in a councilor with experience, from the start of the day, but I'm stressing out about having this class, so quickly after such a traumatic incident (the incident took place on New Years).

I'm also a bit raw about this event. Not only do I have to go back to a class and look at an empty seat, by tragic coincidence, I knew another person who died in the fire, who was an ex-student, I had back when I was a part-time teacher through college. He even worked in the offices right in front of me, after he graduated when I wasn't teaching, and we would go and grab coffee from time to time. Not friends, more acquaintances, but still...

It's rough remembering giving physics lessons to this young man, who had so much promise and potential, and knowing it is all over. And the student we lost was also bright, and a very kind young man. And there's going to be an empty desk there.

I'm basically rambling at this point.

Any pointers or tips? Do I just do ""business as usual""? Do I take a softer approach?

This class has recurrent discipline issues, and I normally have to be a bit of a hard ass. But I don't know if I'll have it in me, to be perfectly frank.",10,1767457190.0,Teachers,7,1.0,False
