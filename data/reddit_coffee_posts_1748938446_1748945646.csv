The weather was a bit hot, but there were plenty of small shops to explore. Dihua Street is an old street full of character, known for its many traditional herbal stores.

I unexpectedly stumbled upon a café/bar, and to my surprise, there was live music as I walked in—classical music! Although I’m not a devoted fan of classical music, I really enjoy live performances.

What’s more, this place hosts live music every day. The interior is beautifully designed, featuring lots of European antique decor and furniture, including a very expensive Steinway piano.

I must say, the coffee was far from mediocre. I ordered a hand-brewed pour-over, and it was excellent!

I think this place was the highlight of my day, and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Dadaocheng. Be sure to check it out!

I have adult children so my husband and I are empty nesters. Our lives are so far from what I pictured as empty nesters. My husband and I have such different views on things vs. how we were 20+ years ago. I have tried everything but something inside of me feels like its slowly dying. My husband is a great person, he owns a business and works very hard and still finds energy to come home and do things here but thats the thing, he likes to work and sit home. He grew up country and i grew up City. I like to adventure to the City and try new restaurants and coffee shops. I like to take random trips to the beach on a weekday to watch the sunset, I like to be spontaneous. When i try to have an honest conversation about how i feel it always becomes an argument so i just quit trying. I often go exploring the world alone while hes working because it works better that way. We are just totally opposite people now and although he loves me very much, i dont feel that is enough. Maybe im selfish… idk. I just know that i feel like the spark i used to have is dying out and I need to feel alive again! What do you do in this situation???",1,1748945512.0,Life,0,1.0,False

The Indian food processing and packaging sector witnessed a mixed bag of performances on June 2, 2025, with key players experiencing varying degrees of price fluctuations and returns. The day's trading activity, observed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), provides a snapshot of the market's current sentiment and reveals key trends within the sector.

**Market Overview: Key Players and Sector Performance**

The dominant players in the food sector, as reflected by the presented share price data, are Britannia Industries, Nestle India, and Tata Consumer Products. These large-cap companies, representing different sub-sectors within the broader food industry, provide a representative view of the market's dynamics.

*   **Britannia Industries:** The company, operating in the Food Processing & Packaging sector, saw its share price stand at ₹5600.8. The stock price exhibited intraday volatility, with a low of ₹5520 and a high of ₹5721.2. This indicates investor interest and potential fluctuations based on market dynamics and news impacting the company. Britannia has shown a positive trend overall, with a 1.4% return in one day, 5.3% over the past month, and a strong 21.6% return over the last three months. Its 52-week performance reflects a range from ₹4506.5 to ₹6473.1, indicating a significant price movement over the year. The daily pivot level for the stock is set at 5632.03, a technical indicator that traders often use to determine potential support and resistance levels.

*   **Nestle India:** Nestle India, also operating in the Food Processing & Packaging sector, closed at ₹2405.15. The stock price exhibited intraday fluctuations, moving between a low of ₹2390.25 and a high of ₹2414.35. The daily change in Nestle India's stock showed a minor decline of -0.04%.

The daily pivot level for Tata Consumer Products is 1104.53.

**Performance Analysis and Market Trends**

The data from June 2nd shows a diverse picture across the food sector. While Britannia Industries demonstrates strong positive momentum, Nestle India shows a slight downturn on the day but solid performance over the last three months. Tata Consumer Products saw a mixed performance with a slight gain on the day, but with a decrease in the month. This disparity underlines the dynamic nature of the food industry and the varied impact of different market factors on individual companies.

*   **Strong performers:** Britannia Industries is showing robust growth, making it the most successful of the three listed companies in the report. This could be attributed to several factors, including market demand for its products, efficient operations, and successful brand management.

*   **Market Corrections and Volatility:** Nestle India and Tata Consumer Products had more modest movements. This could be the result of a variety of factors, including overall market sentiment, company-specific news, and investor expectations. Intraday volatility, as observed in all three companies, is an indication of the dynamic nature of investor behavior and the reaction to market news.

**Sectoral Implications**

The variations in performance are likely influenced by several factors. These include:

*   **Consumer Demand:** Changing consumer preferences and demand for specific food products play a crucial role.
*   **Input Costs:** Fluctuations in raw material prices and supply chain disruptions can affect profitability and stock prices.
*   **Competition:** The food sector is highly competitive, and companies are continuously vying for market share through innovation, pricing, and marketing strategies.
*   **Government Regulations:** Changes in government policies related to food safety, labeling, and taxation can also impact the sector.

**Conclusion and Outlook**

The performance of these three key players on June 2, 2025, underscores the diverse landscape of the Indian food sector. While Britannia Industries is leading the charge with consistent growth, Nestle India and Tata Consumer Products show a mixed outlook, reflecting the impact of current market factors and industry dynamics. Investors should carefully monitor the sector, considering company-specific developments, consumer trends, and broader market influences. The pivot levels provided in the summaries offer valuable technical insights for traders to understand the potential levels of support and resistance, playing an important role in market dynamics. The next few months are likely to be crucial in determining the long-term trajectories of these companies and the overall health of the food industry.

Start Here.,"Let’s face it: picking the right digital marketing agency can feel like trying to choose your next coffee spot in Cairo — there are a lot, and everyone says they’re the best.

But when you’re spending real budget — not just experimenting — you need an agency that knows what they’re doing and gets results without all the fluff.

That’s where [Entasher.com](https://entasher.com/eg/s/digital-marketing-agencies) comes in. It’s a local platform built to connect companies in Egypt with agencies that have actually been vetted — not just whoever pops up on Google first.

So, whether you’re a founder launching your brand or a marketing manager under pressure to hit KPIs, here’s a list of marketing agencies in Egypt that businesses actually trust.

# Why This Matters (More Than Ever)

Marketing isn’t what it was five years ago. You’re not just running posts and boosting ads.  
It’s about:

* Reaching the right people (not just more people)
* Making sure every pound you spend turns into something useful
* Having a team that understands your space — and doesn’t waste your time

# 

# 💬 Not Sure How to Choose?

You’re not alone. Most people go agency-hunting with two questions in mind:

* “Can they do what I need?”
* “Will they actually follow through?”

Things to check:

* Are they showing real work or just mockups?
* Do they work in your industry — or at least something close?
* Can they explain their plan without sounding like a TED Talk?

* You post a request (it takes a few minutes)
* Agencies that fit your criteria reply
* You compare offers, see past work, and move forward without endless meetings

No guesswork. No chasing agencies on Instagram.

1l282ln,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l282ln,Unfair Complaints and Lack of Support,"Today, I accepted a batch with 3 customers. Customer A’s order included 5 cases of water and various grocery items. When I arrived at the delivery address, which was a business location, no one answered the door. I took a photo and sent a message to confirm the address, and I also called, but received no response. I rang the bell and knocked on the door, then walked around the building to check if there was another entrance. I pressed the “Can’t reach customer” button and began waiting. About 7–8 minutes later, someone finally opened the door. I asked if they were expecting an Instacart delivery, and they said, “Yes, that’s correct.” I placed the water and other items just inside the door, into the office. The person didn’t say anything, just stood there and watched. Once I finished unloading all the items, I marked the delivery as complete, said “Have a good day,” and left.

As you can also see in the batch details, this batch had 3 customers. The next delivery was around 6.5 miles away, and the third delivery required me to drive an additional 4 miles after that. As you can imagine, I was trying to complete the deliveries as efficiently and quickly as possible.

However, a while later, this customer apparently messaged me directly through chat, probably thinking they were contacting Instacart Support, and made a complaint. They claimed I had left the items outside and was sitting outside the building after completing the delivery. These claims were completely false. I explained that I was already on the road by then, and that they could verify this via their security cameras if needed.

What I really want to highlight is this: the order included 5 cases of water, toilet paper, sandwiches, and various grocery items — yet the customer only tipped $2. Not only that, but they also made a false complaint against me, which likely affected both my earnings and the visibility of future batches. Unfortunately, there are quite a few customers like this.

Overall, the customer profile in the area I work in isn’t bad, but just like everywhere else, you occasionally run into difficult people. After this situation, I naturally contacted Instacart Support to protect myself. However, they didn’t seem particularly concerned. The conversation ended with generic responses like “The customer might have been having a bad day” or “You might receive a low rating.” I do this job out of necessity and consider myself to be on the same team as Instacart, but sadly, I don’t feel supported. It’s hard to get a clear or satisfying response. Instead, we constantly face false claims from customers.

Just last week, a customer claimed they never received their order, which caused me to earn below my usual average for 3–4 days. These situations take a serious toll, both financially and mentally. I show up at 6:30–6:45 AM, ready outside the store before it even opens at 7:00. I work until 9 or 10 PM, basically until closing time. While I’m driving around all day trying to make ends meet, someone can casually say “I didn’t receive my order,” and that can ruin my entire day or week.

When I try to report such cases to Instacart, it’s hard to find anyone who will truly listen. Regarding the previous incident, I contacted support three times. Finally, one of them said, “Okay, I’ll report it,” and about 1–1.5 weeks later, I received a message saying the low rating had been removed. But since I serve 20–30 customers a day, I probably reset that negative rating myself within 6–7 days. So by the time any action is taken, it’s already too late to help me.

Unfortunately, situations like this happen frequently and are incredibly demotivating. Yesterday, I received similarly generic responses like “Maybe the customer was having a bad day,” “Don’t worry, we’ll look into it,” and “Just keep working.” These types of responses are neither fair nor supportive.

I just wanted to share my experience.
Thank you.

So like, it's nearing end of term tests(like finals), and in the last two weeks of school, coursework(like midterms) usually comes at the students fast since they put it back to back in these last two weeks. And they barely taught us anything this term, and I usually remember stuff by paying attention in class since the information usually comes in prices, but they're rushing it down... or maybe it's just me that just makes it seem it's being rushed down. Because I've been constantly bedrotting, not bring able to focus on anything even if I try. And I'm also trying to not drink coffee since I'm still a teenager and coffee isn't really good for me, but ever since I stopped drinking it I've had to do assignments at th3 last minute and continuously try to catch up with work. I've also noticed that over a few months(or maybe it just seems like it's been the last fee months because it's been much much longer) that I feel quiet apathetic to things, even serious things.

Well I had worked at a local library for two years, before we met, during college and apparently he saw me there but didn’t actually  talk to me, he just would watch me and listen in on my conversations with the people I was checking and my coworkers out to figure out what I liked. Then he apparently followed me and found the coffee shop I frequented. 

All this time I thought we had a sweet first time meeting story. He accidentally bumped into me, apologized, and offered to buy me coffee for the trouble. He told me what he was ordering and it was the exact same thing I always get and I thought it was an amazing coincidence, I joked that it was fate and we spent like an hour talking over coffee. I feel so stupid. Apparently it was similar to a scene in a book that I had read and told my coworker I had thought was cute.

1l27zhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1l27zhx/when_is_a_dead_bedroom_not_a_dead_bedroom/,When is a dead bedroom not a dead bedroom?,"(This is a long read, I really appreciate anyone who has the time to read it)  
  
So, my husband (m,42) and I (f,39) have been together for 15 years, married for 10. At the start, like any new couple, we were having sex pretty much every given moment of the day - indoors, outdoors, upside down, you name it. As all relationships start to settle into that nesting/making a home situation, the sex reduced but was still regular enough. 

Skip to 8 years ago, and my dad passed away. The grief hit me, really really hard. In retrospect I should have got some sort of counselling. When my dad was ill, my husband could have been a lot more supportive. I was spending a lot of time at my parents' house for obvious reasons. My husband didn't seem nearly as supportive as he could have been, during my dad's illness and after he passed. 

  
It was around this time that I became aware that the sex in our marriage had decreased, and had been for some time; sometimes there'd be no sex for a couple of months, then once, then weeks in between. This did go on for a number of years. My husband was frustrated, I was frustrated, but I just felt that over the years his frustration was vocalised in such a way which compounded negativity into any sexual connection that we had. We'd have sex, and he'd say I just lay there like a bag of potatoes, that I couldn't even look him in the eye, that I looked like a dead doll, etc. Well, several years of that, coupled with constant sighs, muttered comments, physical ticks & lack of trying really worked a number on me (to be clear - this wasn't intentional abusive behaviour at all, it was the behaviour of a man who was frustrated). He's really into kink, and I'm not into it to the same level, but at the beginning was willing to try all sorts of new things. I had a few things I liked, but in hindsight I wasn't as forthcoming to incorporate more kink into our everyday sex life (as infrequent as it had become).

Fast forward to 2023. He threatened to leave me. He sat me in our garden, fed me beer and told me that he was staying at his mum's whilst he found a place to live. We talked, we really were honest with each other, and we decided to really give it a go. I told him how I felt, and how I felt like the positivity of sex had been stripped from me because it felt like he was always expecting the worst. We were trying new things, and having more regular sex. I've been developing a more healthy sex drive and really enjoying it. It's been more passionate, and we've been incorporating more kink irregularly but most definitely. We went to a taster day at a local BDSM club. We had a long kinky weekend planned for the end of July, with a visit to a BDSM fair in the day and an afterparty in the night. I'd say we've been having sex as an average of twice a week (I was recording it on the wall calendar for clarity, but haven't done since January as things have been going so well). Things have been good.

  
Then I came home from work on Friday (30th May) to find all of his stuff had gone. Furniture, clothing, books, literally everything. There was no warning, no hint that he was going to do this. I am absolutely in shock and devastated, as I had literally no idea. I phoned him, he came back to the house, saying he was sorry I found out this way, but nothing had changed & we still had a dead bedroom. He said everyone he'd told about our sex life told him that we had a dead bedroom and that we should move out. The only people he'd told are fellow Redditors; not his friends, not his family, and not even his wife (the one person who should know what's going on).

He went from saying the marriage is over, to this being a trial separation, but he needs to gather his thoughts. I've not heard from him, but I think having a week apart to gather our thoughts will result in a better talk when we do meet over a coffee. 

The point of this is, does it really sound like a dead bedroom? (For clarity, I've also spoken to close friends & family about this, but it would be interesting to hear from people who've experienced dead bedrooms as to how they would define a dead bedroom...). When is a dead bedroom not a dead bedroom?

I’ve been feeling this profound sense of unexpected joy lately. It’s weird, tbh, because nothing huge or life-changing has happened. It's like this quiet hope just decided to settle in, unannounced, making its home in my chest. I think it’s got something to do with appreciating the little moments more, like sipping on my coffee while watching the sunrise or hearing my cat purr softly beside me.

Do you ever feel that way? When life slows down just enough to catch these small bits of happiness? It's like I’m in on a secret that the world hasn’t quite caught up to yet. It’s a fleeting feeling, I guess, but powerful.

How do you explain this complex thing to others? Maybe it’s easier to keep it a quiet whisper between us, mere strangers sharing the same sense of wonder. Just wanted to share this thought and hope someone out there feels the same.

But we’re all social beings that are wired for connection, and I do sometimes get the urge for social interactions. 

It’s just tricky because sometimes the urge feels immediate, and I message people to have a phone call etc, but obviously people are busy so aren’t always gonna be available immediately. Also, texting doesn't really ""fill my cup"" so to speak - it needs to either be a phone call or a face-to-face interaction. The problem is, the urge sometimes goes away as quickly as it comes, so I’ll have made all these social plans in advance while I’m in the headspace of wanting social interactions, but then I’ll quickly go back to being content alone and suddenly I have all these social plans that I’ve made in advance that I now feel drained by.

It’s difficult. I don’t have many people at the moment that I can spontaneously interact with. It would be great to have that one friend who lived nearby that I could message and say “hey, wanna get a coffee in an hour or so?” but the friends I have are either super busy, or live very far away. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love doing stuff alone, but sometimes it gets a bit depressing and it doesn’t replace the need for social interactions.

Anyway, I wonder if anyone else gets this. I don’t know what the solution is tbh. I’ve signed up for regular volunteering which should help me get my fix of social interactions while also contributing to society. ",5,1748944171.0,introvert,3,1.0,False

Darkness loomed over Camp Half-Blood these past few days, even though the sun shined brightly.

Barely a week ago, one of Atlas’ operatives infiltrated the camp and planted Greek fire charges on [two triremes](https://redd.it/1kykvu1). Little was left of these ships except for a ruined beach. While the staff and campers were able to clean up the mess, several questions went unanswered.

The matter of who initiated this mission matters little, though one may wonder *how* Atlas’ people knew to attack. Barely a day had passed after the ships were [refurbished](https://redd.it/1kx7z9v) and brought to the docks, when they were destroyed. 

A traitor was in Camp Half-Blood. This incident and [another](https://redd.it/1kue4q0) made that clear.

The matter of where this little mission was initiated from– well, there was an answer. 

Through her powers as the goddess of the maze, Ariadne uncovered the trail left behind by this instigator. Divine familiars from Dionysus, Athena, and Palaemon followed the footsteps-turned-currents north.

From there, however, the trail ran cold.

That brings us to today.

**June 03, 2040**

Breakfast is quiet at Camp Half-Blood. Apart from the fact that the waffle machine is malfunctioning, the wreckage of the two triremes is visible from the dining pavilion. 

The staff members look tired. Chiron runs his eyes over a stack of documents, diligently reading reports from his connections across the country. Argus leaves early, apparently to file the insurance claims on the triremes. Comus tries his best to make waffles in place of the waffle machine. They look like flapjacks. Lady A sips on a cup of tea. The cleaning harpies rush around the kitchen.

A flock of owls and a passenger pigeon sit at the edge of the pavilion. Some watch the breakfast scene. Others look to the horizon, the forest, and the cabins.

Ariadne stands up. She doesn’t need Chiron’s hoof nor her husband’s megaphone to gather the camp’s attention. Her aura alone is enough.

She clears her throat. “Campers, I have received some information related to the *attack* on our shores. I will host a meeting at the Big House. Anyone interested in helping may participate. Those who’ve spoken with me before, I hope to see you there.”

The goddess looks at several campers in the crowd, especially the Heracles table, then she walks out of the pavilion.

As with many prior war councils, the director gathers them in the rec room. They just had breakfast, so she only has tea and coffee for them (juice too). Lady A has a chalkboard showing a map of the Long Island Sound and the surrounding area. Two locations are encircled in orange and blue.

Once everyone is ready, Ariadne begins the meeting.

“First, I want to thank you all for coming. The past few days have been… tense, I know. But, it is in these times that we best stick together. I learned that lesson many years ago. I am just glad that none of you were hurt.” The immortal hero shakes her head. 

“Now, for the attack. Here is what we know.” 

She goes over the Greek fire charges, and the existence of a spy. She passes an artistic sketch of the perpetrators: a sea serpent and a young demigod who vaguely resembles an estranged member of the Eris cabin, Austin Quinn. (ooc; Even if you do know AQ IC, you are not 100% sure it’s him!)

Lastly, she explains the trail that she and the other gods have been investigating. She draws the trail on the board, connecting the camp’s orange circle with the blue.

“The familiars of my husband, Lady Athena, and Lord Palaemon determined that these two perpetrators came from New London, Connecticut. We can make two assumptions here: 

Either the demigod used this town as a staging point close to the camp, or they’ve set up an [outpost](https://redd.it/1kkj8du) to monitor us. Regardless of the outcome, the fact remains that this is a place of importance to the Titan’s forces.”

The director asks them to wait for her to finish.

“Before you all demand to retaliate, we need to know what we’re facing. A reconnaissance mission is necessary. If you all enter that town without any knowledge as to where they are, then you are leaving yourselves open to attack. Now, there is a problem.”

*One of you is a spy.*

“Many of you are known to the Titan camp.” 

Her eyes shift across the gathered faces.

“Some of their members were your fellow campers, or your cabin mates, or even your siblings. Not to mention, their ranks of monsters and cultists can easily spot a demigod from a crowd.” Lady A lets out a pained sigh. “This means that the moment you even go near New London, they will know. So, we must be methodical. 

If any of you can transform, go unnoticed, or have extended senses, then you have my permission to investigate *together*. You will be accompanied by Lady Athena’s owls. Determine where these people are, if they have a base or a transport hub. Then, you will return.” Ariadne looks at the more aggressive campers in the eyes.

“And, then, we will make our next move.”

She nods then smacks the board. Teachers like to do that apparently.

“Any questions?”

—

mod; Hello and welcome to a side event! As mentioned above, this meeting is open to any camper, but only certain campers will be able to participate in this scouting mission:

* Campers with transformation abilities;
* Campers who can go invisible, unnoticed, or unrecognized;
* Campers who can fly;
* Campers who can extend their senses or perception via scrying, delivery powers, or communication; and
* Campers who can provide covert transportation such as animal summons or vehicles.

If you fit this criteria, then you can join the scouting mission! You may detail how you get to camp (via steed or vehicle) and how you navigate New London. **Please roll a d20 and comment your result at the end of the reply.**

If you do not fit the given criteria, don’t worry! You will get a chance to participate in the following New London-focused event once the scouting mission is accomplished. Good luck!

This sensory onslaught, though seemingly minor, appears to follow a pattern akin to that of a variable interval schedule, as theorized perhaps in a parallel universe where Murphy’s Law dictates office acoustics.

During today's unintentional experiment, the orbicularis oculi muscle demonstrated increased tension, particularly correlated with the second auditory click, with a noticeable progression by the fourth repetition. Meanwhile, the sternocleidomastoid conveyed a surprisingly resilient muscle tone, reminiscent of an enduring stoicism in the face of incessant auditory chaos. These patterns coalesced to produce a characteristic micro-twitch, hereafter referred to as the 'Frustration Flutter,' predominantly presenting around the left temple.

Systematically concomitant with these muscular phenomena, a substantial heart rate variability decrement was observed, most likely attributed to a sympathetic nervous system response. Heartbeats approached a perceived tempo of allegro con brio on a metronome, in stark contrast to my prior baseline of a moderato under serene conditions.

Interestingly, throughout this episode, paresthesias manifested in the distal phalanx of my dominant hand, leading to an involuntary simulation of a stress ball squeeze, likely an instinctive counterbalance to the auditory assault in progress. While my scientific inclination stops short of accepting that clicking pens will lead to evolutionary adaptations, it’s tough to ignore the temptation to hypothesize such over the fifth coffee refill.

I suppose this exploration in pseudo-objective workplace sensory evaluation doesn't illuminate new neural pathways, but maybe next time, I'll emulate a more silent era and bring earplugs. Or, just learn to zen out... might be evolutionarily faster. 😅",6,1748943453.0,feelingsUnderMicrosco,0,1.0,False

Wanted to share my experience with a starter setup I recently got into. Making lattes for me and my wife has honestly become one of my favorite parts of the day. It’s super relaxing and has totally become part of my morning routine. Didn’t think I’d get this into it, but here we are.

I’ve had the Encore ESP for about two months now, and it’s been a bit finicky overall. The first beans I tried were the Kauai Coffee medium roast, and I actually managed to dial it in pretty nicely. Got some solid, robust, chocolaty notes that worked great for lattes and mochas.

But after giving the unit a deep clean, things started going sideways. My usual grind setting (16) suddenly produced super watery shots. I had been pulling 18g in, 42–45g out in around 30–35 seconds, but after the clean, it was just blasting out watery, nasty-tasting shots. I went through the whole bag trying to fix it but couldn’t get it right. Haven’t gone back to those beans since.

Thankfully, I had a backup: a 2 lb bag of Lion Coffee’s vanilla macadamia light roast. That’s been my go-to for the past month, and it’s been pulling really nice shots on settings 7–9. I also got a small sample of some dark roast Kona beans from Big Island, but I couldn’t dial that in either—same issue as the Kauai roast, just way too fast.

Still learning, but it’s been a fun (and frustrating) ride so far. Anyone else had similar issues with the Encore ESP after cleaning? I contacted support and they are sending some shims.

[Consistent grinder for light roasts](https://preview.redd.it/a740dfmxlo4f1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87abbcd9cbf658160625ded8387a96c38743054c)

Now onto the DF64 Gen 2. I've had it for about a week and a half, and honestly, I haven’t been able to pull any great shots with it yet. I’ve mostly been using it for testing alongside my Encore ESP, just comparing results. After my rough experience tweaking the ESP, I haven’t done any real troubleshooting on the DF64 yet—I’m holding off on opening it up or messing with alignment until I get more comfortable. Probably going to give it a few more weeks before I do a deep clean.

So far, I’ve been testing with 18g in and getting around 40–46g out in 35–50 seconds. At setting 18, the machine chokes, so I’ve been slowly dialing it coarser. The first few shots were super sour with the finer settings. I’ve landed around setting 21, which gave me that visually perfect bottomless portafilter shot, but taste-wise, it was still too bitter for me. Just not hitting the flavor profile I’m after—especially compared to the more consistent shots I was getting from the Baratza ESP.

I’m thinking about trying the Kauai Coffee medium roast again to see if I can bring back those chocolatey notes I liked so much. It seems true what people say—flat burr grinders tend to pull out more fruity, acidic flavors, which just isn’t my preference. I’m definitely more into the deeper, chocolate-forward profiles, so I’ll probably start testing with some darker roasts soon.

If I can’t get the kind of flavor I enjoy out of this thing, I might end up returning the DF64. We'll see.

Was doing some digging on torque specs for the DF64 but couldn’t find anything solid. I work on cars and guns, so I’m used to torquing things down precisely—and it got me thinking: since the burrs are held in with 3 screws, wouldn’t uneven torque mess with alignment?

Just wondering if anyone has an official torque spec for the DF64 or even a general recommendation. If not, I might try experimenting with my torque screwdriver that I usually use for firearm work, just to get even pressure across the burrs.

1l27iw0,https://i.redd.it/sb0ckrzmlo4f1.jpeg,"Time to acknowledge the fact that I am genetically predisposed to this. I don’t have to like it though.  [This is a very serious post, but I need a bit of humour to get me through it.]","I’m waiting for the genetic testing to be completed, but it’s highly likely because it runs in the family and despite what my numbers show I don’t feast on butter and whipping cream every day.  I didn’t know much about this, but I knew we had a cholesterol issue so I’ve been on statins for years. Recently had to stop taking them, and Repatha put me out of commission for three months so right now I’m working with a lipid specialist to get approved for the next level drug, although I’ve also started a vegetarian diet to see if that helps a bit. If you have arthritis, which I do, I would be very careful before starting Repatha. It basically kicked both of my arthritis into flare and it took me three months to recover. Brain fog like I have never experienced, pain that was off the charts and hard to manage.  Apparently this is a statistically insignificant side effect that their customer support people don’t even know about so it took us two months to figure what the hell was going on and a month after the last shot for me to start to recover.

Regarding statins that’s incredibly high dose and something to discuss with the doctor, maybe talk to the pharmacist about this, is the reduction in bad cholesterol doesn’t double with every 10 mg. I believe the baseline at 10 mg is around 45% reduction and it only seems to go up about 10% With every 10 mg above that. These numbers are probably available with more precision through your pharmacist. All that to say that’s a huge dose and the higher the dose the fewer benefits in reduction and the more chance of severe side effects. I was taking 20 mg a day and I was getting issues with my legs. That’s why I had to stop because I was after over 20 years.

I’ve been a professional chef for decades and I love food. But I love life. The first thing I cut out was the 5% creamer in my coffee. That’s 20 mg of cholesterol a day.  Black black coffee is not for everybody. There are a few decent non-dairy creamers from the market that aren’t full of crap.

I’m lucky to have wonderful family members and I’m up at my cousin’s house with my another cousin who was a vegetarian and they’ve been really supportive, taught me a lot, fed me really well, kombucha is your friend if you go this route. It’s very gassy process lol

Interestingly, my cousin‘s husband has the same thing and they control it with no medication, but an extremely strict vegan diet with no oils. His LDL is 2.   And they have known about this for years and successfully kept it at bay. They sent me this book. This is the principal they follow at the proof is in the fact he is still alive with perfect numbers in his 70s. I don’t think I could do this, but I think I can mostly do vegetarian. When I meet my doctor, I’m also going to discuss the alternative of a lower dose of statin and how much healthier diet.  https://a.co/d/7Spu6Uw

Also, you should read up about cafestrol, It could be making things worse if you are a coffee drinker. I learned about this one years ago when my numbers started going up after switching to French press coffee. It took a few months. I switched back to paper filter and everything went back to normal.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafestol

This took my father at 52 years old his brother at 65 that Brother’s daughter had bypass surgery at 49 and died at age and the cardiac issues made her quality of life not the best.. Her daughter died at age 44, this is real and it is serious and it scares the shit out of me And I have a 33 year-old son who now needs to be tested. Just because the cosmos has a sense of humor. I have been suffering from two types of arthritis for 40 years and because of the flare that Repatha started I have to go on a biologic for my arthritis after avoiding them. This is just kind of like the buttercream frosting on top of the shit cake, but what the hell I’m still standing and I’m reasonably healthy everything considered. FML.

I know this is kind of rambling, I’ve been processing this since we got the terrifying numbers back towards the end of March at honestly I have been so sick from that freaking drug that this is really the first time I’ve put down everything I’ve come up with.

The fog slithered like a dying thing—low and heavy, coiling around lampposts, stretching thin fingers along cobblestones slick with last night’s rain. From somewhere unseen, a church bell tolled once, twice—a slow, iron sound mourning something already buried.

Detective Elias Rourke stepped past the constable’s chalk lines behind Milliner’s Row, pulling his collar high against the damp. The alley reeked—sour meat, soot, and something older, deeper. Rats skittered as he approached the body.

He didn’t need to ask who had done it.

She was waiting again.

Same as before.

Amaya sat beside the corpse on an overturned crate, hands folded in her lap like a schoolgirl at chapel. Her black boots were spotless. No blood on her gloves. The boy’s throat had been opened cleanly—no mess, no hesitation.

Surgical.

She watched Rourke with unblinking eyes, their colorless clarity more unsettling than any madness. No triumph. No regret. Just... stillness.

“Evening, Detective,” she said. Her voice was quiet and flat—like the last echo of a prayer long forgotten.

Rourke studied her in silence, then glanced at the boy.

“You ever run?”

“I’ve never needed to.”


---

The Interrogation Room.

Gaslight hissed and fluttered. The plaster walls peeled in long strips, like skin. Rourke sat at the edge of the table, sleeves rolled to the elbows. A cigarette trembled between his fingers, barely lit.

Across from him, Amaya sat with iron cuffs circling her wrists. She hadn’t spoken since her arrest. Not until now.

“You look tired,” she said.

“It’s been a long week.”

“You haven’t slept in three days.”

He raised an eyebrow.

“You’ve had six cups of coffee today. No alcohol. Your pupils are dilated. Your left hand twitches slightly every time you inhale.”

She tilted her head. “Do you always lie so poorly?”

He stared at her. “You always watch this closely?”

“It’s how I survive.”

“No. You survive because the law hesitates.”

She smiled—barely.

“Let’s talk about Gunther’s Lane,” he said. “Seven-year-old girl. Missing for two weeks. Found wrapped in white cloth, left in a pew like an offering.”

Amaya was silent.

“You cut her open. Took her heart.”

She blinked slowly. “It was an experiment.”

Rourke slammed his palm on the table. The cigarette ash snapped.

“What the hell is wrong with you?”

“I ask myself the same thing.”

“You cut out a child’s heart!”

“I didn’t hate her. I didn’t feel anything at all. There is only a gap where emotion should live.”

She raised her cuffed hands.

“This is my shape. But inside? There’s only observation.”

He sat back, jaw clenched. The cigarette had burned out.

“You know what they call you.”

“Monster. Devil. Abomination.” She shrugged. “People need words to protect themselves from mirrors.”

He narrowed his eyes. “Mirrors?”

“Yes.” Her voice barely stirred the air. “Because if I’m not a monster, what does that make you? The soldier who shot children in the hills of India. The detective who let a man bleed out because you feared the dark.”

His mouth twitched. “You don’t know—”

“I don’t feel,” she interrupted. “But I notice. I smell guilt like rot. I hear it in your breath. You want me to be evil. Because it means you aren’t.”

He stood abruptly. The chair screeched back.

“I sleep at night,” he muttered.

“Do you?” she asked.

The bell tolled again—faint, outside, far away.


---

The Execution Chamber.

The room was white—too white. The paint had a sickly yellow sheen in the electric glow, like old teeth. The air was still. Too still. As if even the walls held breath.

Amaya sat strapped to the chair, the copper headpiece gleaming dully above her brow. Her hair had been tied back with surgical precision. Her face remained unreadable.

Behind the glass, officials murmured. Journalists leaned forward with pens poised. Rourke stood at the back, hat against his chest.

No one met his eyes.

Amaya’s gaze moved through the crowd—not searching, only cataloguing.

Pain. Anger. Curiosity. Fear.

So many faces. So many masks.

The warden stepped forward.

“Any last words?”

She looked at him. A beat passed. Then another.

“Will I feel it?”

Confused silence rippled.

“The pain,” she said, voice low. “The pain that teaches. That molds. That makes humans real.”

Her eyes turned toward the glass. Toward Rourke.

“I wonder,” she whispered, “if it will make me real too.”

A long silence.

Then the switch.

Her body arched violently. Fingers splayed. A cry escaped—not of fear, not of agony—something raw and unnamable. For one moment, something sparked in her eyes. Something alive.

Then stillness.

Eyes open. Staring.

And in them—faintly, perhaps impossibly—was the shimmer of something that might have been recognition.


---

Rourke lingered after the crowd dispersed. After the officials left. After the corpse was wheeled away beneath a white sheet.

He lit a cigarette.

The match shook in his hand.

The bell tolled again, far off.

A flicker of ash dropped to the floor.

He stared at it.

He still didn’t know who the monster had been.

My husband works for a bakery as a store manager (think Greggs, but smaller)
They implemented an automatic ordering last year and it's been absolutely shite. He's put in complaint after complaint but nothing is happening.

They keep setting certain popular items to 0 on their system and not send out any of the item (coffee,steak beaks etc). He can't change it on the system anymore.
He's having to use his own time and fuel to go to other shops and run around to make sure he had them.
Sometimes he can get an adhoc order, but has to really push for it, but it is seen as a black mark on his sales as it means he's not ordered it and makes him look incompetent . They set it to automatic as some stores were over ordering certain items, leading to a lot of waste.
It's supposed to predict trends and look at stock levels and order accordingly.

The CEO retired and a new one put in place earlier this year. He knew the previous one quite well and always held my husband In high regard. He was very hands on and would do regular visits, even covering a shift or two when needed 
The new one is pretty much uncontactable. He's tried going above to complain, but gets referred back to the replenishment department.

He gets a bonus every quarter, up to £1000. He has certain criteria he has to meet, but since this system, he's pretty much scraped getting the lowest rate of £250 as he's not meeting his targets. One being waste, one being replenishment and one being ad hoc orders. 

Where can he go from here? He has been looking at new jobs, but he's been here about ten years and 90% it's great. Good staff, good hours and decent pay. It's just this part. He's said many others have complained but nothing is changing. They keep dangling bigger bonuses etc to improve staff productivity but it's not attainable as long as head office are fucking about.

I felt a lot of responsibility for this friend because another friend had entrusted me with her safety while she was visiting her. This friend had never cited discomfort around my BF in the 2 weeks she stayed with us.

Not until a few weeks after the break up did I find out that only one of my friends allegedly saw my boyfriend looking up her skirt, and the rest just ""felt uncomfortable"" around him.

I will also note there was a possibility that he was under the influence of cannabis (he'd had edibles and I wasn't sure how strong they were), and my boyfriend and I were sitting on the floor whereas the rest of my friends had been sitting on a pair of couches, and there was food on the coffee table between us, so there was a possibility he wasn't staring at her at all.

None of my friends attempted to tip me off to this or take photos at the dinner, despite being in the perfect position to do so. 

I felt pressured into breaking up with him despite remembering little of the night myself as they'd waited two weeks after the dinner to tell me that this had happened (sketchy?). Also sketchy that the girl who did apparently see it didn't bother to text any of the other girls despite having all their numbers.

I was in no way in a position to defend him, especially since many of my friends have had bad experiences with men, so when they ""get a feeling"" they take that feeling and run with it and no amount of evidence to the contrary (especially with a supposed eyewitness account) could convince them otherwise.

The combined issues of waiting so long to tell me, making no attempt to have me acknowledge it, and the use of feelings to enforce the accusations doesn't sit right with me.

So, WIBTA if I told my friends I won't immediately take an accusation from them seriously in the future, especially if there is weak evidence?

# Best Live Edge Coffee Table 2025: Top Picks & Guide

the live edge coffee table has become a staple in modern interior design, offering a unique blend of rustic charm adn contemporary elegance. These tables showcase the natural beauty of wood,celebrating the organic lines and imperfections that make each piece truly one-of-a-kind. For buyers in 2025, selecting the right live edge coffee table involves considering not only aesthetics but also durability, sustainability, and functionality.Our guide aims to provide a complete overview of the top live edge coffee tables available, highlighting key features and benefits to help you make an informed decision. We'll explore various styles, materials, and price points, ensuring you find the perfect centerpiece for your living space.

## Key features Analysis

The features that define a top-tier live edge coffee table go beyond mere aesthetics.Dimensions,wood type,finish,and base design all play crucial roles in its overall appeal and functionality.Let's delve into the key aspects that set the best models apart.**Slab Dimensions and Proportions**

The dimensions of the slab directly influence its suitability for different living spaces. A coffee table with a length of 48-60 inches and a width of 24-36 inches typically provides ample surface area for most living rooms. Proportions are critical,ensuring the table doesn't overwhelm the room or feel too small.

Careful consideration should be given to the slab's thickness, which typically ranges from 1.5 to 3 inches. A thicker slab conveys a sense of sturdiness and quality, while a thinner slab may offer a more minimalist aesthetic.

**Wood Species and Grain Pattern**

the choice of wood species significantly impacts the table's appearance,durability,and overall character. Popular options include walnut, maple, oak, and cherry, each with unique grain patterns and color variations. Walnut is prized for its rich, dark tones and intricate grain, while maple offers a lighter, more contemporary feel.

The grain pattern should be carefully assessed, considering whether you prefer a straight, consistent grain or a more dynamic, character-rich pattern with knots and inclusions. The type of edge on the slab dictates the quality of the piece. A rough and jagged live edge offers a dramatic style, while a more polished edge provides sleek luxury.

**Finish and Protective Coating**

The finish applied to the wood is crucial for protecting the slab from moisture, scratches, and stains. Options include oil-based finishes,varnishes,and epoxy resins,each offering different levels of protection and aesthetic effects. An oil-based finish typically enhances the natural beauty of the wood,providing a warm,matte appearance.

Varnishes offer a more durable and water-resistant finish,while epoxy resins can create a glossy,glass-like surface that highlights the wood's grain.It is crucial to pick a safe and effective finish that matches well with the surrounding fixtures.

**Base Design and Materials**

The base of the coffee table is an integral element of its overall design and stability. Common base materials include steel, wood, and wrought iron. Steel bases offer a modern, industrial aesthetic, while wooden bases provide a more traditional, rustic feel.

The base design should complement the slab's style and shape,ensuring a cohesive and balanced appearance. Options range from simple, minimalist legs to more elaborate, sculptural designs. The base should have rubber feet to prevent scratching on the floor and avoid any sliding.

Key features of a high-quality live edge coffee table include:

   Durable wood slab material
   Protective coating over the surface
   stable and stylish base design
   Unique live edge characteristics

1l278c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVpnEng/comments/1l278c2/best_vpns_for_norway/,Best VPNs for Norway,"Picture this: you're sitting in a cozy café in Bergen, trying to catch up on your favorite show on NRK, but you're getting that dreaded ""not available in your region"" message. Or maybe you're a Norwegian expat living abroad, desperately missing those Sunday evening episodes of ""Skam"" that you used to binge-watch back home. Sound familiar?

Norway might be known for its stunning fjords and progressive policies, but when it comes to online privacy and content access, even this Nordic paradise has its challenges. Whether you're concerned about government surveillance, want to stream Norwegian TV abroad, or simply need to protect your digital footprint, choosing the right VPN is crucial.

After testing dozens of VPN services specifically for Norwegian users, I've compiled this comprehensive guide to help you navigate the sometimes murky waters of online privacy and digital freedom. Let's dive deep into what makes a VPN perfect for Norway and which services actually deliver on their promises.

# Why Norway Needs VPNs: The Digital Landscape You Should Know About

# The 9 Eyes Reality

Here's something that might surprise you: Norway isn't the privacy haven you might expect. The country is part of the **9 Eyes intelligence alliance**, which means your government actively participates in international surveillance programs. This alliance includes the original Five Eyes countries (US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand) plus Denmark, France, Netherlands, and Norway.

What does this mean for you? The alliance conducts surveillance of online activities, and laws in these countries grant intelligence agencies extensive monitoring powers. Your internet service provider might be legally required to retain your browsing data and share it with authorities when requested.

# Streaming Restrictions Hit Hard

If you've ever tried watching your favorite Norwegian shows while traveling, you know the frustration. Popular Norwegian streaming services like NRK, TV2 Sumo, and Viafree are geo-blocked, meaning you can only access them with a Norwegian IP address. The same goes in reverse – many international streaming libraries become unavailable when you're browsing from Norway.

# The Privacy Protection Act Reality

While Norway implements GDPR-equivalent data protection through the Personal Data Act, this doesn't stop private companies from collecting and potentially selling your data. The country has also passed data retention laws requiring service providers to store user data for law enforcement access.

# Top 5 Best VPNs for Norway: Tested and Ranked

After extensively testing VPN services for speed, security, streaming capabilities, and Norway-specific features, here are my top recommendations:

# 1. NordVPN: The Overall Champion

**Price:** Starting at $3.39/month (2-year plan) **Norwegian Servers:** 60+ servers in Oslo **Key Strength:** Unbeatable combination of speed, security, and streaming

NordVPN consistently topped our tests and here's why it's my top pick for Norwegian users. With over 7,800 servers in 118 countries, including more than 60 in Norway, you'll never struggle with connection speeds or availability.

**What Makes It Special:**

* **Lightning-fast NordLynx protocol**: In our speed tests, NordVPN maintained an impressive 93% of baseline speed (468Mbps average)
* **Panama jurisdiction**: Being based outside the 14 Eyes alliance means your data stays private
* **Streaming powerhouse**: Easily unblocks Netflix, BBC iPlayer, and all Norwegian streaming services
* **Advanced security features**: Double VPN, Onion over VPN, and CyberSec ad-blocking

**Real-world performance**: During my three-month testing period, NordVPN never failed to access NRK or TV2 from outside Norway. The connection remained stable even during peak usage hours.

# 2. ExpressVPN: The Premium Experience

**Price:** $6.67/month (12-month plan + 3 free months) **Norwegian Servers:** Multiple high-speed servers in Norway **Key Strength:** Best-in-class obfuscation and reliability

If you're willing to pay a bit more for premium service, ExpressVPN delivers exceptional performance. With average download speeds of 89 Mbps on Norwegian servers and fast obfuscation capabilities, it's perfect for 4K streaming without lag.

**Why Choose ExpressVPN:**

* **Superior obfuscation**: Great for bypassing deep packet inspection
* **24/7 expert support**: Live chat available anytime you need help
* **30-day money-back guarantee**: Try it risk-free

**Personal experience**: When I was traveling through Southeast Asia, ExpressVPN was the only service that consistently maintained access to Norwegian content without triggering VPN detection.

# 3. Surfshark: The Budget-Friendly Champion

**Price:** $2.19/month (2-year plan) **Norwegian Servers:** Fast servers in multiple Norwegian locations **Key Strength:** Unlimited simultaneous connections at an unbeatable price

Don't let the low price fool you – Surfshark packs serious punch. In our testing, it achieved 93% speed retention with download speeds averaging 466Mbps.

**Surfshark's Standout Features:**

* **Unlimited devices**: Protect your entire family's digital life
* **CleanWeb ad-blocker**: Built-in protection against malware and ads
* **MultiHop**: Double-encrypt your connection through two countries

**Value proposition**: For families or users with multiple devices, Surfshark's unlimited connections make it incredibly cost-effective. I tested it on 8 devices simultaneously without any performance issues.

# 4. CyberGhost: The User-Friendly Option

**Price:** $1.99/month (2-year plan + 4 months free) **Norwegian Servers:** Part of 11,500+ global server network **Key Strength:** Beginner-friendly interface with excellent value

CyberGhost makes VPN usage incredibly straightforward, perfect if you're new to VPNs or prefer simplicity over complexity.

**PIA's Privacy Advantages:**

* **Legal proof of no-logs**: Multiple court cases confirmed zero data retention

# Key Features Every Norwegian VPN User Needs

# Essential Security Features

When choosing a VPN for use in Norway, certain security features are non-negotiable given the country's surveillance landscape:

**Military-Grade Encryption**: AES-256 encryption is currently the gold standard, making your data virtually impossible to crack.

**Kill Switch Protection**: If your VPN connection drops, this feature immediately cuts your internet to prevent data leaks.

**DNS Leak Protection**: Ensures your browsing requests don't accidentally bypass the VPN tunnel.

**No-Logs Policy**: Both NordVPN and Surfshark have undergone independent audits confirming they don't store user activity data.

# Streaming-Specific Requirements

For Norwegian users who want to access geo-blocked content:

**Norwegian Server Availability**: Essential for accessing Norwegian content from abroad, with NordVPN offering 60+ servers in Oslo alone.

**High-Speed Connections**: You need at least 25Mbps for Netflix in HD quality.

**Reliable Unblocking**: The VPN should consistently bypass geo-restrictions without triggering proxy detection.

# Streaming Norwegian Content Abroad: The Complete Guide

# Accessing NRK TV Outside Norway

NRK is completely free to watch but geo-blocked outside Norway. Here's what you need to know:

**Available Content**: NRK TV includes channels like NRK 1, NRK 2, and Super, plus radio stations like NRK P1, NRK P2, and NRK Jazz.

**Best VPNs for NRK**: NordVPN has proven most reliable, with multiple Norwegian servers that consistently work with NRK without triggering proxy errors.

# TV2 Sumo Access

TV2 Sumo is Norway's largest commercial broadcaster, requiring both registration and a Norwegian IP address.

**Device Compatibility**: Works on PCs, Macs, iOS, Android, Apple TV, Android TV, Chromecast, and smart TV apps.

# Viafree and Other Services

Popular Norwegian streaming platforms like Viafree are also region-locked, but quality VPNs like NordVPN can unblock them easily.

# Legal Considerations: Is Using a VPN Legal in Norway?

**The short answer**: Yes, VPNs are completely legal in Norway. There's no law prohibiting VPN use, and residents are free to use them.

**What this means for you**:

* You can legally use VPNs for privacy protection
* Accessing geo-blocked content for personal use is typically fine
* However, always review streaming platforms' terms of service
* Using VPNs for illegal activities remains against the law

**Government stance**: Norwegian authorities recognize VPNs as legitimate tools for enhancing personal digital security and protecting online privacy.

# Common Issues and Troubleshooting

# VPN Not Working with Norwegian Streaming Services

**Problem**: Getting ""proxy detected"" errors **Solution**:

* Switch to a different Norwegian server
* Clear your browser cache and cookies
* Try connecting through incognito/private browsing mode
* Contact your VPN's support team for updated servers

# Slow Connection Speeds

**Problem**: VPN significantly slows your internet **Solution**:

* Connect to the nearest server location
* Switch VPN protocols (try WireGuard or NordLynx)
* Close unnecessary applications using bandwidth
* Consider upgrading your internet plan

# Unable to Access Content

**Problem**: Still can't access desired content with VPN **Solution**:

* Verify your IP location using online tools
* Ensure WebRTC isn't leaking your real location
* Try different servers within the same country
* Check if the service works without VPN first

# Norwegian Streaming Services: What's Worth Watching

While you're setting up your VPN, here are some Norwegian gems worth checking out:

**NRK Originals**: Hit shows like ""Exit,"" ""Pørni,"" and ""Kielergata"" showcase the best of Norwegian television.

**Live Sports**: Catch Eliteserien football matches on TV 2 Direkte.

**Cultural Programming**: Don't miss ""Dagsrevyen"" at 7 pm for comprehensive news coverage.

# The Bottom Line: Choosing Your Perfect Norwegian VPN

After months of testing and analysis, here's my honest recommendation: **NordVPN offers the best overall value for Norwegian users**. Its combination of 60+ Norwegian servers, proven no-logs policy, and consistent streaming performance makes it worth the slightly higher price.

However, your perfect VPN depends on your specific needs:

* **For families on a budget**: Surfshark's unlimited connections and $2.19/month pricing can't be beaten
* **For premium performance**: ExpressVPN's superior obfuscation and reliability justify the higher cost
* **For privacy purists**: PIA's court-proven no-logs policy provides maximum anonymity
* **For beginners**: CyberGhost's user-friendly interface makes VPN usage effortless

Remember, all top VPN providers offer 30-day money-back guarantees, so you can test them risk-free to see which works best for your specific situation.

# Take Action: Protect Your Digital Life Today

Norway's digital landscape might be relatively free, but true online privacy requires taking proactive steps. Whether you're streaming ""Skam"" from abroad, protecting yourself from government surveillance, or simply wanting peace of mind on public WiFi, a quality VPN is essential.

Don't wait until you need it urgently – set up your VPN today. Your future self will thank you when you're sipping coffee in a Tokyo café, seamlessly streaming your favorite Norwegian shows, knowing your digital footprint remains completely private.

Device: Staresso portable espresso machine

Retailer: 4barista (online store)

Issue: Aftermarket basket got stuck on day one, machine became unusable

Their response:

Refused warranty

Blamed me for using an aftermarket basket (not warned against anywhere on their site or product docs)

Also blamed me for “grinding too fine” (seriously…)

Refused refund or repair


Bonus red flag: Their site says the inner chamber is stainless steel—but there’s plastic in contact with hot water, which is not disclosed anywhere. When I pointed this out, they asked “where does it say it’s 100% stainless?” Total deflection.


So I’m left with:

A brand new but unusable device

No warranty

Lost money

A retailer that shifts blame instead of standing by their products


If you’re considering buying from 4barista, think twice. They don’t back what they sell. Also a bit disappointed in Staresso for allowing this kind of representation of their product.",1,1748941825.0,espresso,5,0.54,False

1l274ng,https://www.reddit.com/r/gentleparenting/comments/1l274ng/why_parenting_feels_tougher_these_days/,Why Parenting Feels Tougher These Days,"Ever feel like raising kids today is just... different? Like, way tougher than maybe our parents had it? I know I do sometimes, like when I'm trying to figure out yet another new game my kid is obsessed with! You're definitely not alone – and honestly, it's not just you. Parenting truly has gotten more complex.

Here's why I think it's extra challenging these days, speaking from my own rollercoaster ride through parenthood:

**The Digital Headache:**

Oh my goodness, this is a big one for me. I remember my childhood where ""screen time"" meant Saturday morning cartoons and maybe a movie. Now, it's phones, tablets, gaming consoles, social media, YouTube... and it feels like it's ALL the time. I often find myself wrestling with guilt over how much [screen time](https://theparentingpedia.com/how-digital-media-affects-children/) is too much, or trying to understand what 'Roblox' even is! Trying to manage that balance, protect them from online dangers, and still let them explore can feel like a full-time job in itself. How do you even keep up with all the new apps and trends?!

**The Pressure to Be Perfect:**

This one hits hard. Before, you might compare your kids to the neighbor's, but now, with social media, we're constantly bombarded with the highlight reels of other families. Perfect birthday parties, spotless houses, kids who seemingly ace everything. I've definitely had moments where I've scrolled through Instagram and just thought, ""Am I doing enough? Should my kid be doing X, Y, and Z by now?"" It's so easy to fall into that trap of thinking everyone else has it perfectly together, leading to a lot of self-doubt and pressure to be ""perfect.""

**Information Overload:**

Remember when your mom just told you what to do, or you looked up one book? Now? Google gives you a million different opinions on every single parenting decision – from sleep training to picky eaters, gentle parenting to firm boundaries. I distinctly remember agonizing over solid foods for my little one, reading conflicting advice until my head spun, wishing someone would just give me *one* clear answer! It's awesome to have resources, but it can also be totally overwhelming trying to figure out what's truly best for *your* unique family.

**The Support Gap:**

This is a huge one that I feel keenly. Unlike previous generations, many parents today lack extended family or a built-in village nearby. I often wish my parents or in-laws lived closer, so I could just drop the kids off for an hour and grab a coffee, or get a bit of wisdom from my aunts and uncles. That lack of consistent, immediate family or strong community support can make the parenting journey feel so much more isolated and lonely.

**Changing Social Norms:**

What was ""normal"" for us growing up isn't always the case now. There's a lot more awareness around mental health, gender identity, neurodiversity, and diverse family structures. Which is fantastic progress, but it also means parents need to learn and adapt to new conversations and approaches. I'm often learning alongside my kids, trying to understand new perspectives and teach them empathy and acceptance in ways I wasn't explicitly taught as a child.

It's a lot to navigate, and honestly, we're all just doing our best. So, if you're feeling overwhelmed, remember you're amazing for even trying to keep up. Let's cut ourselves some slack and support each other through this wild parenting journey!

Context: My husband (m79) & I (f67)met shortly before the pandemic. He moved in when the lockdowns started & we got married 2 months ago. Yes, we are old & if you think that is cute or disgusting please move on. Don’t treat me like your granny. We are active, bright, accomplished & financially secure. We laugh a lot, enjoy a healthy sex life (yes, really) & go out several days/ nights a week. 

Situation One: (just surfaced) When H moved in he was WFH & I was not working so I made him three meals a day, nothing elaborate but decent & with a fair amount of variety. I had a busy career for many years so until the pandemic daily cooking was not the focus of my day. Usually it was a dreaded chore. During the pandemic I treated it as a new hobby & even enjoyed it a bit. I also cooked dinner 4x a week for my ex who was also my neighbor. He was in fragile health so meal prep was a form of caretaking. After his death I enjoyed cooking less. I started using premade meals more (healthyish from high end vendors, Good Eggs, Locale) Then H retired. We went from 3 meals a day to 2. I continued to make sure H got his favorite foods several times a week. H has never cooked for me. Even bringing me coffee is a rare occurance. I do 100% of the planning, shopping, & cooking & 90% of the clean up. Last week, off & on,  H was moody & a bit distant. On Saturday he admitted he was out of sorts and said the reason was because earlier in the week I mentioned that cooking made me sad after my ex’s death because cooking for Ex had been the one thing I could do for him. H went on to say he was tired of precooked meals & was upset that I cooked for Ex but not him. (Reminder: prior to my Ex’s death I made 4 meals a week for Ex & 15 for H. I still make 10-15 for H each week) He complained vociferously about some menu items and my preferences.  He said he wasn't comfortable in the kitchen because it is not his kitchen. Seeking clarification I  asked,  “Are you angry I do not cook?” He answered affirmatively. My first response was to defend myself. My second was to begin menu planning & then I remembered it is not 1955 & H is not an invalid (altho he has back pain) or a toddler. I told H I would no longer be cooking for him. He is responsible for everything he eats & I am responsible for what I eat. I have not changed my mind. He has not apologized. Today he said, “I would like to have some home cooked meals.” it isn't going to happen. AIO?

Situation 2: Prior to 2020 H had lived in the same home for 33 years. It was packed to the rafters with everything a midcentury divorced, reasonably affluent man could have wished for, 1000+ movies, 3 large closets full of clothes & shoes, electronics (2 of everything & latest versions of most things) luxury items, pictures, tools, collectables, massive amounts of supplies from Costco & junk. There was so much stuff he often couldn't find what he was looking for. When we agreed to combine households I began sorting thru his things. Except for the bathroom & kitchen cabinets I held every item up for him to decide what to keep, give away or toss. I lifted, packed, donated, & unpacked everything myself because of his back. I even endured the hellscape of FB Marketplace to sell or try to sell 8-10 pieces of used furniture. (he listed & sold two collectable items) When assistance was needed I found it. To make room for his stuff I gave away or sold many of my things. I turned a living room into a media room & designed an office space for  his computers & collectables. It looks great! Everything in the garage is his, neatly organized & accessible. His 1000+ movies are alphabetized & 79 years of pictures & memorabilia are organized in boxes by decade. 1/2 of the bedroom is his, redesigned to suit his taste & needs. He has enjoyed having friends over to show them his new home.  He enjoys using all of the new spaces.But he tells me several times a week how hard it was to leave his place, even tho he has lived here for 51/2 years. At least once a week he complains that some possession disappeared without his knowledge. 🤷‍♀️I spent 8 hours helping him today without a single “thank you”. When I mentioned that his resentment about the move troubled me he said it will take awhile to move past his hard feelings. I have worked my a** off to get his place ready to sell. I found the realtor, made  decorating decisions,  created punchlists & am doing walk thrus so he (we) can reap profits. But the ratio of his complaints to gratitude is approximately 10:1. I am tremendously angry, but it is not a hot anger of words. It is a cold, steel wall of anger. AIO?",1,1748941173.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

So I guess they added background sync. No more need to open the app the sync your hydration.

They also added two way apple health sync for caffein and coffee if you track you consumption with another app.

One thing added I can‘t find what is are these little symbols (water drop / 100%) next to every sip.

First I thought that different drinks don‘t count 100% towards your hydration goal (like juice or soda). But it isn‘t the case. When adding soda it still counts 100% towards your goal.

It also can‘t be how much of your hydration goal you met with each sip because it is 100% for every sip. Even the first of the day.

1l27078,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVpnEng/comments/1l27078/best_country_for_your_binance_vpn_connection/,Best Country for Your Binance VPN Connection,"Picture this: you're sitting in a coffee shop in Singapore, ready to execute what could be your most profitable crypto trade yet, only to discover that Binance has blocked access from your current location. Or perhaps you're a digital nomad who's discovered that your home country's Binance restrictions follow you wherever you go. If you've found yourself in either scenario, you're not alone—and you're probably wondering which countries offer the best VPN server locations for accessing Binance safely and legally.

The intersection of VPN usage, cryptocurrency trading, and international regulations creates a complex web that even experienced traders struggle to navigate. In 2024, an estimated 43% of cryptocurrency users reported using a VPN for trading or managing their digital assets, yet many are unaware of the crucial differences between various VPN jurisdictions and how they affect both security and compliance.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the legal landscape surrounding VPN usage with Binance, explore the best countries for VPN connections, and help you understand how to balance privacy, security, and regulatory compliance. Whether you're looking to protect your trading activities or simply need to access your account while traveling, understanding jurisdiction selection is crucial for both your financial security and legal protection.

# Understanding the Complex Legal Landscape

Before diving into specific country recommendations, it's essential to understand that using a VPN with Binance exists in a nuanced legal gray area that varies significantly depending on your citizenship, physical location, and intended use.

While using VPN is legal in the United States, it may not be legal in other countries or jurisdictions. The fundamental principle here is that VPN usage itself is legal in most developed countries, but the context and purpose of that usage can create complications. In most countries, using a VPN is perfectly legal, but problems arise when you consider the intersection of local cryptocurrency regulations, exchange policies, and international compliance requirements.

Binance's approach to VPN usage reflects this complexity. While Binance allows VPN use, it violates Binance's terms of service for US residents, which could result in account suspension if detected. This distinction is crucial: the legality of VPN usage doesn't automatically make it compliant with exchange policies, and vice versa.

The regulatory environment for cryptocurrency trading varies dramatically across jurisdictions. Cryptocurrency is currently legal in 119 countries and four British Overseas Territories, but this legal status doesn't necessarily translate to unrestricted access to international exchanges like Binance. Some countries restricted on Binance include the United States, Canada, Singapore, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and more.

Understanding these restrictions is vital because using a VPN or other methods to access Binance from a banned country may be against Binance's terms of service, and could result in the suspension or termination of your account. The consequences can be severe, potentially including account closure and loss of funds, particularly if you're attempting to circumvent restrictions from a country where Binance is explicitly prohibited.

# Why VPN Jurisdiction Matters for Binance Users

The choice of VPN server location isn't just about bypassing geographic restrictions—it's about understanding how different jurisdictions approach privacy, data protection, and international cooperation with surveillance programs.

A country's jurisdiction has a significant impact on how well your online privacy is protected. Countries that are part of international surveillance alliances, such as the Five Eyes, Nine Eyes, and Fourteen Eyes, may share user data with each other. This consideration becomes particularly important for cryptocurrency traders who value financial privacy and want to minimize the risk of their trading activities being monitored or shared between governments.

Privacy-friendly jurisdictions offer several advantages for VPN users. VPN servers based in countries outside these alliances, like Panama or Romania, offer better protection from governmental surveillance and data sharing. Countries such as Switzerland and Iceland have built reputations as privacy havens due to their strong data protection laws and resistance to international pressure for data sharing.

Romania is another top country for privacy and security, thanks to its favorable legal framework. Romania does not enforce mandatory data retention laws, allowing VPN providers to maintain strict no-logging policies. This regulatory environment is particularly beneficial for cryptocurrency traders who want to ensure their financial activities remain private.

However, privacy considerations must be balanced against practical access needs. While a VPN server in a highly privacy-focused country might offer the best theoretical protection, it's useless if Binance blocks that region or if the connection quality is too poor for effective trading.

# Top Countries for Binance VPN Connections

When selecting a VPN server location for Binance access, you need to consider several factors: the country's relationship with Binance, connection quality, regulatory environment, and privacy protections. Here are the most effective options:

**European Union Countries**

Germany stands out as an excellent choice for Binance VPN connections. The country offers robust infrastructure and EU-standard privacy protections, while maintaining generally positive relationships with cryptocurrency exchanges. German servers typically provide excellent connection speeds and stability, making them ideal for high-frequency trading activities.

Switzerland represents the gold standard for privacy-focused VPN connections. Countries with strict data protection regulations often enforce no-logging policies, ensuring that your online activities are not tracked or recorded. Locations like Switzerland and Iceland are renowned for their privacy-friendly environments. Switzerland's neutrality and strong financial privacy traditions make it particularly attractive for cryptocurrency traders seeking maximum privacy protection.

The Netherlands, despite Binance's recent exit from the Dutch market, remains a popular VPN server location due to its excellent internet infrastructure and central European location. However, users should be aware that Binance exited the Dutch market after failing to secure regulatory approval, following a €3.3 million fine for unregistered operations.

**Asian Markets**

Singapore historically served as a major hub for cryptocurrency trading and offers excellent connectivity throughout Asia. The city-state's business-friendly environment and advanced technological infrastructure make it an attractive VPN server location, though users should monitor current Binance policies regarding Singapore-based access.

Japan provides another solid option for Asian connectivity, with the country's progressive approach to cryptocurrency regulation creating a generally favorable environment for trading activities. Japanese servers often offer excellent speeds and reliability for users throughout the Asia-Pacific region.

**Strategic Global Locations**

The United Kingdom remains a popular choice despite Brexit-related complications. Yes, Binance is available in the United Kingdom. UK citizens can deposit, trade, and sell cryptocurrencies on Binance, though with some restrictions on specific services like leveraged trading.

Canada presents an interesting case study in regulatory changes. Binance left Canada in 2023 due to strict regulations. In 2024, it was fined $4.32 million for violating anti-money laundering laws. While Canadian VPN servers might still provide access, users should exercise caution and stay informed about evolving regulations.

For users seeking maximum global connectivity options, servers in countries like Sweden, Finland, or Austria offer excellent infrastructure and generally privacy-friendly regulations while maintaining access to Binance's full service range.

# Privacy-Focused Jurisdictions for Enhanced Security

For traders prioritizing privacy and security above all else, certain jurisdictions offer superior protection from surveillance and data sharing agreements.

Panama is one of the few countries outside the jurisdiction of the Five Eyes, Nine Eyes, and Fourteen Eyes alliances, making it an attractive choice for VPN users seeking the highest level of privacy. Panama's privacy-friendly laws and absence of governmental surveillance make it ideal for users who want to ensure their cryptocurrency trading activities remain completely private.

The British Virgin Islands has gained popularity among privacy-conscious users, particularly because British Virgin Islands jurisdiction provides additional privacy as the country isn't part of any surveillance sharing pacts. Many premium VPN providers base their operations in the BVI specifically to take advantage of these privacy protections.

Romania's robust privacy protections make it a safe location for users who need high levels of online anonymity and security, particularly for sensitive activities. The country's position outside major surveillance alliances, combined with its lack of mandatory data retention laws, creates an environment where VPN providers can legitimately maintain no-logging policies.

Iceland deserves special mention for its combination of strong privacy laws and excellent internet infrastructure. The country's commitment to digital rights and freedom of information, combined with its geographic isolation from major power centers, makes it an attractive option for privacy-conscious cryptocurrency traders.

These privacy-focused jurisdictions become particularly important when you consider that cryptocurrency trading data could be valuable to various parties, from tax authorities to competitors. By choosing VPN servers in jurisdictions with strong privacy protections, traders can add an additional layer of security to their activities.

# Risk Assessment and Best Practices

Using a VPN with Binance requires careful consideration of various risks and the implementation of best practices to minimize potential problems.

Account security should be your primary concern. If you're caught using a VPN in a country like Iran or Russia, Binance will definitely ban your account, and it may potentially seize your cryptocurrency. This highlights the importance of understanding exactly which countries Binance considers prohibited and ensuring your VPN usage doesn't conflict with these restrictions.

The detection risk varies significantly depending on your approach. Binance may freeze your assets and revoke your access if it detects trading from an unauthorized country using a VPN. However, the platform's detection methods aren't perfect, and if you're using a VPN in a non-restricted area, Binance may view your activity as suspicious and temporarily block your account rather than permanently banning it.

KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance remains crucial regardless of VPN usage. Users from restricted countries can not verify their identity on Binance and, therefore, cannot use any of its services. This means that VPN usage can only be effective if you're already an eligible user from a supported country.

Best practices for minimizing risks include maintaining consistency in your apparent location, using high-quality VPN services that are less likely to be detected, and ensuring your account information matches your actual eligibility for Binance services. Additionally, always stay informed about changing regulations and Binance policies, as the landscape evolves rapidly.

Remember that using a VPN to circumvent geo-blocking, specifically for creating a Binance account in a country other than your permanent residence, does violate Binance's Terms of Service. This makes it crucial to understand the difference between using a VPN for privacy and security versus using it to circumvent eligibility restrictions.

# Making the Right Choice: Balancing Privacy, Access, and Compliance

Selecting the best country for your Binance VPN connection ultimately depends on your specific circumstances, risk tolerance, and priorities. The landscape of cryptocurrency regulation and VPN usage continues evolving rapidly, with new developments affecting the viability of different approaches.

For users prioritizing maximum privacy and security, jurisdictions like Panama, Switzerland, or the British Virgin Islands offer the strongest protections against surveillance and data sharing. These locations provide the highest level of anonymity but may require more careful selection of VPN providers and potentially higher costs.

Traders focused on reliable access and performance might find European Union countries like Germany or privacy-friendly nations like Iceland offer the best balance of access, speed, and reasonable privacy protections. These options typically provide excellent infrastructure while maintaining adequate privacy safeguards.

The most important consideration remains legal compliance in your actual jurisdiction combined with adherence to Binance's terms of service. Remember, the goal of cryptocurrency is not to evade laws but to participate in a revolutionary financial system. Any VPN usage should enhance your security and privacy while remaining within legal and policy boundaries.

As the regulatory landscape continues evolving, staying informed about changes in both local laws and exchange policies becomes increasingly important. The intersection of cryptocurrency regulation, privacy technology, and international compliance will likely become more complex rather than simpler, making education and careful decision-making essential for all crypto traders.

Whether you choose a privacy-focused jurisdiction or prioritize practical access considerations, remember that the best VPN country for Binance is ultimately the one that meets your specific needs while keeping you safe, legal, and compliant with all applicable regulations and policies.",1,1748940916.0,TheVpnEng,0,1.0,False
1l26zuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1l26zuu/got_back_together_with_my_ex_the_learnings/,Got back together with my Ex - the learnings,"Inspired from another recent post, that reminded me that I also never posted my update. If you can handle another success story or just need a little bit of hope, this is for you.

Background: Dated for 2 years. After six months, arguments started coming in and just got more an more. In the end, it was like 80% arguments and we were tired, frustrated and done. It was him who pulled the trigger. We tried everything from talking countless hours to working through some couple therapy books together. We really wanted to make it work. But it didn't. 

That was back in October. We had some unpleasant text conversations somewhere in November, he wished me merry Christmas, then again nothing. I was healing, feeling relatively okay and started to move on slowly.

Then I ran into him completely unprepared, in a different country, far away from both our homes. Now this sounds a bit like a movie, but when I saw him, it was like a bandaid being placed on my heart and soul. All I wanted was to run into his arms. We left the place we met and went for a coffee, talked for hours, he told me he missed me. 

Now this is where I could've screwed it up, but it magically worked out. I took him home with me that day. From that time on though, we were taking it VERY slow, almost 4 months before we finally decided to try again.

What did I learn and what has changed? 


1. I have a habit of going back to exes so I took this one very slow and thoughtful. I made my requirements clear and reinforced what I wanted immediately and didn't wait until I got grumpy so we'd fight. 


2. I finished therapy right before I met him. It was three years and I went mainly for relationship issues that I had my whole life. 


3. He changed. Yes, sometimes they do, although it's vedy unlikely. He suddenly is way more committed, not only on the inside. He makes sure I know. He makes longterm plans with me, talks about moving in together, puts me on his agenda more etc. I realized that was one thing that was missing for me now that it is there and I don't ever want to go back to whatever semi-committed state that was before. 


4. I was very clear from the beginning that long distance we had for the two years was now only a short-term solution for me. It is too expensive and I'm in my thirties and done with casual stuff like that. I want to move in with someone in the foreseeable future. We are now actively planning on closing the gap. 


5. In the end, as cheesy as it sounds, love was a huge factor. It sure isn't enough to keep a relationship and we both learned that in a very painful way. But that combination of attraction, friendship and wanting the best for each other is what keeps us close and engaged. 

So yeah, that is it and yes, it can still blow up. All I know now is that it works pretty damn good and not only for the sake of butterflies. There were several delicate situations already, but we managed them. 

What I learned too 

1. sunken coast fallacy is real. The more you fight and work for a thing, the more you cling onto it, no matter the coast. Even if it means riding a dead horse. Sometimes, letting go actually frees more resources. 

2. The first bump energy I had like two or three weeks after breakup was UNREAL. I never noticed how much energy I was draining in this relationship until I was almost literaly flying through my day with magic superpowers after it ended. I still remember this feeling and it is my benchmark to start reflecting on things whenever I feel too drained again. 

I think that's all. Yes there was a lot of luck involved and being in the right place at the right time. But I am also very positive this is  the outcome of a lot of work on both of us. So at this point, I'm really proud of what I have achieved coming from a pretty disfunctional family. I am planning to break even more of these patterns in the future.",6,1748940874.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False
1l26zq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/1l26zq4/has_anyone_lived_a_story_like_mine/,Has anyone lived a story like mine?,"**To start...**  
My husband used to be a wild one when he was younger. He's always loved adventure, moved city to city, and trying new things, partied a lot, drank a lot, didn't really care about consequences.

So when he told his friends and family he was going to settle down and get married, no one really believed him.

He came to my city 10 years ago. We've been together for 7 years, married for 3. Now we're 32 and 34.

During our time together, he's cheated on me multiple times. But in a strange way, each time was less bad than the one before.

I know that sounds weird. So let me explain.

**+++++**  
Back when we were still dating, he slept with a girl he met on Instagram before he knew me when she visited our city. I found out months after. We had a huge fight. He swore he'd change. After that, he let me check his phone whenever I wanted. He hated it, but he never changed his password, not even once.

**++++**  
After we got married, he didn't sleep with anyone (as far as I know), but I caught him dowloading and flirting with girls on Tinder when I went on a one-week trip with my family. Again, we fought. He admitted it was wrong. He deleted Tinder. I never see any dating apps on his phone anymore. (I checked his phone a few times a month).

**+++**  
Later, it turned into him going to ""happy ending"" massage places while drunk. Then chatting with bar girls or call girls on Telegram. He tried to hide the messages, but I still found them. Still, he never locked me out of his phone, never stopped me from checking. Starting from this time, he just kept silent. Whenever I confronted him, he just said what he did was wrong and he felt ashamed.

**++**  
Then, about a month ago, we had another bad fight. He came home drunk at 1 AM after going out with his boss. I noticed he kept his phone on him even when he went to the bathroom. My gut told me to check. So I did. He had been looking up call girl prices. He said nothing happened, that he was just drunk and messing around. At the end, he chose to come home. But after that night, we stopped sharing a room. I moved into the guest room.

**+**  
A week later, things cooled down a bit after we talked with some friends. We started opening up again, said he wanted to prove he was serious this time. One day, I casually asked to check his phone. He agreed. But this time, he forgot to delete a message thread that he stopped a few months ago. It was with some girl he met at a bar. They’d been flirting pretty heavily. I got angry again. We fought again. But this time, it was like something just broke. We stopped talking completely.

My friends and family all told me to leave. I started leaning toward divorce too.

**-----**

Then one night, he asked if he should move out. I said yes. He asked if we could have one last talk before he left. I agreed.

That night, we finally talked. After two weeks of silence. He said he really was trying. That he’d do anything to fix things, and that he would give me all the time, do anything I needed to heal. He said he didn’t want to lose me.

Two days later, we went to couples therapy for the first time as the last resort.

I shared my side of story like above and how it affected me that I’ve been depressed and finally lose my job.

He shared his side of story that the thing he did before our marriage was wrong. But after we got marriage, he tried to change. It was the pressure from work, the client meetings that made him drunk and did stupid things like flirting.

According to him, he did nothing wrong (meaning he thought flirting around was a wrong thing but not a serious problem).

Our therapist pointed out it was a big problem. Perharps, he's more suitable for an opended-marriage which can offering him freedom once more, but he declined. He maintained he was finished with that life, wanting only me and the family we planned to build together, committing fully to our relationship.

Funny thing is that at the end of the session, the therapist kind of hinted that maybe I should walk away. But the final decision is mine. No matter what comes after, the first thing I need to do is to love myself again and to prioritize myself.

That’s where I’m at...

I don’t know if this marriage can be saved. Honestly, I don’t even feel the energy to try anymore. But at least, I’m starting to feel like I’m coming back to life. I’m getting out of “survival mode.” Every day, I try to do one small thing just for me.

I feel lucky that the people around me have been so kind. My mom calls me every day just to chat. My younger brother texts me random stuff about his summer job. My best friend checks in every few days. Even that man, everyday he leaves me a motivational quote next to my morning coffee and shows me that he’s trying to work things out. He’s on a business trip now. We’re not talking, but a friend who works with him says he’s just been working, going to meetings, and sleeping alone in the hotel.

I don’t know if anyone out there has a story like mine. I’m not really looking for advice. I know every relationship is different. But if you’re still reading this, I want to say this one thing:

Please, don’t forget to love yourself.

I may never be the bright, energetic 25-year-old I used to be. All the hurt and stress from the last few years have changed me. I’m more quiet now. I overthink more. I get anxious. I feel things deeply. But I’m learning to love that version of me too. The one who’s been through pain and is still standing.

One day at a time, I’m learning to forgive, to accept, and to hope for myself again.

I'm feeling better bit by bit. Maybe that’s enough for now.",3,1748940861.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,2,1.0,False

(I had work to do so I insisted on staying up these nights)

Again, it happened with me in bed at about 5AM or so and I had a cup of coffee about 2ish hours ago. I put my tablet off to the side kind of forgetting about it before I quickly dozed off.

I then had some sort of dream where I was in a group of kids about the age of 10 or 11ish, wanting to ""escape"" or run from something. This dream felt like it lasted only for a good 30 seconds or so before there was a door at the end of the room. It opened and everyone ran out, except for me.

The door shut on me and here I felt I was conscious, and it happens regularly that I regain some sort of consciousness. I placed my hand on the door and prepared to be scared by said monster that kind of looked like a skeleton of the sort

It then made a loud ""HAAA"" and it really felt like it was out of a game. By then, I thought I'd just wake up normally before I saw a blocky avatar. Its skin and hair color was pale white and it seemed to wear a black sleek dress, and ""it"" kind of jumpscared me as well. Then came a black skeletal hand that emerged from the left side of my vision.

At this rate, I'm a bit shaken and I recognized I was kind of awake here. I was laying down on my right when I wanted to scream out of fear when my mind went ""**don't** scream, no one will hear you"", and I'm not sure if that was my inner monologue or pure instinct to not wake up the whole house (by now, it's like 5:40am)

I laid in bed frightened, not wanting to move after my mind said not to, my left arm numb and it would be about a good 2 minutes of me contemplating if I wanted to turn in bed (*to my left, as I was facing a wall to my right*), because I was scared that something would be behind me. I did anyways.

After that, I take out my tablet and scrolled on social media to get it off my mind... it was so quick and yet it felt like forever. I told a few friends about this but I'm unsure if this is a sort of sleep paralysis or not? Would be happy to hear from other people who may have had similar experiences, thank you

- Commutes via bus
- Turning a sterotyped unsafe weeded council house garden into a safe garden, which makes moving from here more desirable for others who may need this place
- Maybe a green bin
- No subscriptions
- No TV related bills
- No debt
- No drugs/alcohol/clubbing/cigarettes
- No takeaways
- No taxi's
- No excessive consumerism (minimalist)
- As little junk food as possible
- A couple coffees out a week
- Mininal and cheapest appliances/devices
- No/very few low cost brands
- Save £100pm so that when I do go back to work, the coming off benefits transition won't be so scary/hard/risky
- Occassionally a gym membership
- Activities > stuff for kid, so using this money to take them indoor play or parks or swimming
- Paid for therapy the majoirty of times I've been on benefits that has helped a ton
- Used the library or its app
- Second hand, as much as brought new
- Sleep early and rise early, like in a job, but also because it feels like a luxury I'm not taking for granted

Basically, I feel like this money isn't really mine and so I should make the most of it and try to make our home as safe, clean and us as healthy and happy as possible so when we do come off benefits, we stay off benefits forever.

I've been experimenting with different kvass recipes for the past couple of months, but so far I wasn't able to replicate the same taste that I remember as a child from 33 years ago from a kvass barrel in Kyiv. The closest one I came up with consisted of a kvass wort concentrate that I got from a Russian store and fermented with Safale US-05. It did have some very mild sour flavor due to citric acid that is included in the wort but the overall result was far from what it's supposed to be. 

Anyway, I have been growing a rye sourdough starter for the past month, and I believe it is ready to be used for kvass fermentation. What I want to try is to make my own kvass wort concentrate and use a sourdough starter to try replicating the classic kvass taste. I watched a bazillion YouTube videos of people making kvass, but none of them explained how to make a wort concentrate at home. 

Here is what I have handy:

1. Rye malt (half-milled)
2. Fermented rye malt powder (made in Russia)
3. Barley malt powder
4. Rye flour
5. Molasses 
6. Rye sourdough starter
7. Chicory powder (made in Russia)

Of course, sugar and water is a must so I didn't explicitly include them in the list. The last ingredient that is chicory powder is something I have no idea about, but a Russian store owner said that people in Russia often use it to make kvass and also coffee substitute...(?) 

Does anyone have any recipe for a kvass wort concentrate that I can make from the above ingredients? Doesn't have to be all of the ingredients mentioned above or maybe some stuff is missing? Any suggestions would be highly appreciated! ",1,1748940360.0,Kvass,0,1.0,False

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/iaMgO58MQQb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

I didn’t notice it at first.
Not through the late night calls,

or when you told me to go out and have fun
even though all I wanted
was to be near you,
quietly beside you,
doing my own thing while you did yours.

I didn’t fall.
I arrived.
Somewhere between choosing your kiss
over cheesecake,
tucking a note in your messy bag,
and smiling at red lights
because it meant more time with you.

I am in love with you.
Not from fireworks or fairytales,
but from the way your hand finds mine when you drive,
the way you teach me about whipped cream and drinks,
and the way you looked at me
when you said ""Happy Birthday, baby.""

There wasn’t a single moment—
just a quiet unfolding,
like a sunrise that doesn’t ask to be noticed,
but suddenly, the whole world is bathed in gold.

To the point that this morning I found a pest on the leaves and went at it with the energy of an army of a thousand men (top tip: surround your tomatoes with basil and rosemary plants, pests really don't like them - or so the internet says).

Somehow, the small routine I built around it - make coffee, grab water, water the plants, talk to them, finish coffee, start day - has become the most grounding part of my day (and also the clearest sign yet that I am 100% turning into my mum).

For context, there are 4 of us in the apartment and we are all students. Besides that, I share a bathroom with that flatmate.

I’ve been living with her since December 2023, but the first 9 months were pretty smooth, as I rented a room with a separate entrance and bathroom. But in October last year, everything went downhill because I had to move to a different room located nearby that girl’s one and started sharing the bathroom with her.

First, the issues were minor. For example, I once left a few apples in the fridge, and they were gone the next day. This can be either my hallucinations or her, as there wasn’t anyone else in the apartment that day. Of course, the first assumption must be the case, but with all the other things, I’m inclined to believe that she ate them. 

Also, my new bedroom has a door to the balcony as well as the living room. I’m not interested in staying there, but my flatmates are. Due to the endless loud talks, I have to constantly wear my headphones. Besides that, since the balcony table and chairs are situated just by my window, I’m always feeling like being watched so that I have to live with closed roller shutters. And last but not least, all the common areas are never empty. Going to the kitchen - even to get coffee - feels intimidating. Furthermore, when the kitchen is empty, they still leave their belongings on the table, and I have to eat in my room.

Yet, as mentioned, I’ve somehow gotten used to it. But this month, the situation became worse. Another flatmate - her friend - left the city, and she started inviting her friends over daily. Now I start feeling more uncomfortable and unsafe, as I don’t know those people or what to expect from them. Even if she is staying at home during the day, other girls arrive at the house in the evening, and their talks seem infinite. They laugh so hard that my headphones don’t help. What’s more, some of them smoke on the balcony, and the smell seeps into my room instantly.

Another problem is her boyfriend. Besides all of the above, they have sex, which I hear, of course. Additionally, I’m pretty sure that he uses my toilet paper and toothpaste. Of course, at first, I thought that it was my hallucination again. But in several instances, I noticed the toothpaste tube moving and getting exhausted faster. A few days ago, I put a bottle of cream on top of it to prove my suspicions, and later these two items were switched. 

Don’t get me wrong. I’m totally fine with inviting friends. But every day? I never feel safe at home, and constant noises don’t let me relax completely, especially since I work two jobs online besides my studies. 

Yet, the main problem is me, for sure. I understand that I have the same rights as her and may use all of the common areas as well. But when I decide to go to the kitchen to have coffee, I feel like there’s a stone in my throat and stay in my room instead. And when the laughter gets overwhelming, I just start crying or hitting my pillow. 

I’m afraid to confront her, as she doesn’t break any rules, and I don’t know what her reaction would be. And I’m not sure about how I would react as well because I sometimes get too emotional and can start crying uncontrollably, and I don’t want her to feel sorry for me. 

Thanks for reading my novel, I didn’t expect it to be so long but wanted to get it off my chest. I’d like to read your thoughts on this situation and some advice for the future. Hopefully, the issue will be resolved soon - in two weeks, I leave the apartment until October, and she is going to move out by then.

P.S. Sorry for any mistakes, as English isn’t my first language.

1l26p3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/HersWeightloss/comments/1l26p3o/kit_1_vent/,Kit 1 - Vent,"Hello all, 

I received my second shipment for kit 1 and honestly don’t feel motivated to continue. I’ve tried all the tips and nothing helps with the side effects. I’ve restarted my first shipment about 3 times. Giving time in between to let my body adjust and have had no luck. I’ve tried speaking with the doctor to help but all they do is prescribe anti nausea meds, which help a little with the nausea but not with the fatigue or brain fog. I’ve tried reducing my dosage, taking with meals, taking at night, and skipping one day extra between meds. 

I have two toddlers at home and work full time. The side effects make it extremely difficult to focus at work or be present with my kids and husband. When I’m on the meds I’m in a constant state of feeling very unwell. I feel like it’s unfair to my family. I do lose weight when I have taken the meds but I suspect it’s because I’m so nauseous I’m unable to eat very much. 

Side note, I’ve always been super sensitive to to meds. I’ve never been able to take things like Vicodin or Norco because they make me so nauseous. I’ve also never been able to be on hormonal birth control because the side effects feel so intense for me. Even most vitamins make me throw up, even if I take them with food. I’ve come to the conclusion that my body is just sensitive and has a low tolerance for literally anything. Even drinking alcohol will almost immediately make me feel a little nauseous. 

I’m so disappointed, I really had high hopes for these meds. Being postpartum and not having a lot of my old clothes fit me is hard. I was too skinny during COVID, right before I got pregnant with my first. I lost most of my baby weight after my first and was really pleased with the weight I kept. I felt really comfortable in my body. But about a month after I stopped breastfeeding I gained about 15lbs and then I got pregnant again. With my second, I lost maybe 10lbs after I gave birth and have been struggling to lose the rest. Today, I weigh 35lbs more than I did pre-kids and 20lbs more than what I weighed when I was comfortable with my weight gain. I practice yoga daily and try to get at least two cardio days in each week. This was my normal routine before I had kids so it’s pretty easy to stick to but no matter how active I am, my weight is pretty stagnant. I don’t eat horribly. Most of my meals are home cooked. I don’t eat too many carbs, I stay away from processed sugar and most dairy as I’m also lactose intolerant. I do have fast food, maybe once a week but my diet is pretty balanced. I only drink black coffee and tea on occasion. And I usually have 50oz of water a day. (With liquid in) I don’t drink anything else. Just liquid IV and black coffee. I don’t drink soda, or juice or any energy drinks. 

I think I have one more try in me but I don’t have hopes at all. I’m really just doing it because it feels like such a waste of money to just give up. If anyone can relate and was able to figure it out please let me know! 

I’m certain the second shipment will go unopened. Im still trying to get through my first Any idea what I can do with it? ",1,1748939607.0,HersWeightloss,0,1.0,False
1l26osf,https://i.redd.it/yymh14d6bo4f1.png,From Lottery Millionaire to Ninja Boss – The Birth of the Secret Commando,"Gábor K’s life was far from a Hollywood success story. He lived in a tiny rented apartment; his fridge contained only mustard and half a bologna sausage, and his greatest luxury was when he could afford two packs of instant soup for dinner. His only passion was playing the lottery—not so much for the hope, but for the ritual of scratching the tickets.

One Friday night, however, fate (and pure chance) decided to change Gábor’s life: he hit the Eurojackpot. Suddenly, his bank account showed a sum so large that even the online banking app crashed.

# The Big Idea

Most people would have bought a luxury villa, a sports car, or a private island. But Gábor had always loved superhero movies and, as a child, secretly dreamed of becoming a ninja. One evening, while munching on mustard-covered bologna, inspiration struck:  
“What if I used the money to create the world’s first secret, high-tech ninja commando to fight crime?”

# The Team

Gábor didn’t waste time:

* He hired an ex-soldier who only introduced himself as “Master” and who, rumor had it, once dismantled a tank using only a toothpick.
* He found a genius hacker who even ordered his morning coffee in encrypted messages.
* The third team member was a parkour champion who always entered buildings through the window instead of using the stairs.

Their headquarters was in an abandoned factory building, which Gábor bought online with a single click. Using his lottery winnings, they acquired all sorts of high-tech gadgets: night vision contact lenses, silent drones, and a self-reloading pizza box (the latter was Gábor’s personal favorite).

# The First Mission

Their first mission targeted a notorious salami-stealing gang that terrorized every grocery store in the city at night. The ninja commando glided silently across rooftops, the hacker disabled the alarms, the parkour champion snuck in through the vents, and Gábor… well, he was testing the pizza box at HQ, but gave orders over the radio.

The salami thieves had no idea what hit them: in seconds, they were all on the floor, tied up, with a slice of mustard-covered bologna in their mouths.

# Cleaning Up the World (with a Dose of Humor)

The commando carried out more and more missions: they busted an illegal photocopying mafia, foiled the city’s biggest chocolate egg smuggling ring, and once even took on an evil cat gang causing havoc in the park.

Gábor finally found what he was looking for: not only was he rich, but he became a real hero—even if it was in secret. And although the pizza box sometimes got stuck in his ninja suit and the hacker ordered encrypted coffee a bit too often, the world became just a little bit better.

Money alone won’t make you happy—but if you have a secret ninja commando, life definitely gets a lot more entertaining!",1,1748939571.0,DaillyAIStorys,0,1.0,False

I decided to write here to seek advice. I’m a 41-year-old single mom of three kids. Don’t judge me for having a heavy crush on someone who’s 10 years younger. Since the pandemic, I’ve been working from home and rarely go out. For the past eight years, I’ve been happy with my single life.

Lately, when I finish work at 4 p.m., I go to this small town coffee shop in Bulacan. There’s this cute barista who always greets me with a smile. I know it’s part of his job, and I’ve gotten used to his welcome since November last year.

I go to this coffee shop every single day, sometimes in the afternoon and sometimes before closing. I just sit there and relax. He doesn’t talk to me much, just the occasional small talk.

Two weeks ago, we moved houses, which is a bit further from the coffee shop. I tried going to a place closer, but the vibe was different. So, sometimes I drive 10 mins just to get there. Since then, I feel like every time I open the door, I’ll see his face light up. He even said that if I couldnt go there every day, he’d be willing to deliver, even if it’s a long way.

I’m feeling crazy thinking about him right now. I miss him so much. Don’t judge me. My kids are now college students, and I provide very well. I haven’t dated in the past eight years, so this feeling is foreign to me but it’s exciting and super kilig.

About 9 years ago, I bonded with an acquaintance in my friend group. We had a lot in common - outdoorsy, hiking, watersports, camping, photography, books, etc. We were “best friends” for several years. In this post, we’ll call her “P”



At one point, I had a falling out with one of my best friends since childhood (Calling her “Q”) and an additional friend in our group. It was traumatizing. In this story, the details don’t matter. P had backed me up but remained friends with the other girls. I couldn’t really be around the other 2 without having a panic attack for a while (I attended counseling and am better now). It’s been about 5 years since that happened. 

 

A year later, I moved away. So sad! I came home to visit often. When I was home, P and I always made it a point to hang out (and another best friend of mine, let’s call her “X”). 



After 3 wonderful years away, I went through a devastating breakup and decided to move back home. I left my career, the friends I made in my new home, and the lifestyle I had curated. But at least I had my friends and family while I looked for a new job.



I decided to take time off and travel as much as I could with my new boyfriend. Everyone loves him! I’m traveling about 50% of the time. P also got a new boyfriend too! He’s great! They’re so happy together and I make an effort to spend time getting to know him.



Fast forward to…. October. We’re all out drinking. My friend X mentions that they’re going to the city for Halloween and asks me to join. I say of course! I was going to be out of town, but I booked a plane ticket to come home to be a part of it. A week before the night out, I send a group text to X and P saying how excited I am to join. I’m met with a response from P… “Well I also invited Q so you guys need to figure that out”



OK…. I just respond with “Let me know if she’s going and I’ll take it from there”.



Never heard back. Am I crazy? She said she was invited, not that she was going… I didn’t want to text her if I didn’t have to. But I never found out if she had accepted the invitation or not. In fact, I found out after the night in question that she had accepted the invitation, then never showed up and ghosted all their texts that night. When my other friends asked if they should text me to come out instead, P said no. 



I confronted her about it on instagram. I told her that ghosting me like that really hurt my feelings. And she went off! She was so mad!!! She said she couldn’t handle being in the middle of us and it was so much easier when I lived somewhere else! I asked her if we could please sit down in person and talk it out. It took weeks until she finally had the free time to do so. I told her that It had been long enough since the incident and I can be in the same room with Q. She doesn’t need to pick between us, it’s not a big deal. I tried my very best to let her know she does not have to worry about animosity between Q and I. We’re adults now (we were only 23 when the falling out happened).



I don’t know if Q disagreed or if P didn’t believe me, because this behavior continued.



Soon after, P is engaged. Yay! We talk about the wedding, she says my boyfriend and I are invited. She texts me and asks his last name and my mailing address. Obviously for a wedding invite, right?



Last time I see her is December. I text her a couple times a month for 4 months asking if she wants to hang out. Get coffee, get wine, go for a walk, go to the lake, go camping…. She rarely responds. And when she does, it’s 2 days later claiming she was busy or out of service. She is planning a wedding and has a full time job and a daughter. I believe she’s busy and stressed out. I give her space. I still reach out once or twice a month. Completely ghosted.



Finally, I’m planning my summer trips. I haven’t received a wedding invite and I need to know if I have to book a flight home. I’d been planning for months to be home for her wedding. I send a text to ask if I’m still invited. I’m not. The reason I was given is that they’re keeping it small. I had asked her months prior if she was going to have a bachelorette party, she said no. I only found out I wasn’t invited when I saw people venmoing each other for her bachelorette party. (was checking my crypto, not snooping on purpose)



I’m sure you’re thinking “how did you not see this sooner?” Well, I’m an optimist. I give people the benefit of the doubt. I didn’t think she’d be such a chicken shit coward to ghost her friend of 10 years who had been making an effort to rebuild their relationship. I wish I could say I’m surprised, but I’m not. The signs were all there and I chose to ignore them. I can say this confidently because she had been hinting to X for months that she wanted her to tell me instead of doing it herself. I know it was hard for X to tell me the truth, but I’m extremely grateful she did.



I’m not necessarily sad…. I’m just so disappointed. She has put so many of our mutual friends in an awkward position by leaving me in the dark. They don’t deserve that burden. I have told her straight up that as long as she’s honest with me, I will understand. Instead, she chose to pretend like I don’t exist with the hope that I would disappear. I’m glad to leave the drama that she invoked in the past and move on. This last year has been pure bliss, with the exception of her behavior. 



I don't know why she did this. I will no longer bother her. I feel sad that our mutual friends are in an awkward position but I will never try and turn them against her or make them choose between us. I find it unfortunate to lose a friend I have so much history with, but it’s for the best. I mourn our friendship and writing this has been helpful in the grieving process. I’ve left out so many details but I think I captured the gist of it all. 



TLDR; Best friend uninvited me to her wedding. Ghosted me with the hopes I would just give up trying to be her friend.

I’m planning a solo trip to **Tbilisi, Georgia**, for my **birthday** and would love some advice from locals or experienced travelers.

I’ve found an Airbnb that I’m drawn to — it’s a spacious, beautifully styled apartment near **Liberty Square**. It’s a bit on the pricey side, but the **aesthetic, size, and location** seem worth it to me.

🛏️ **Here’s the listing**: [LINK](https://www.airbnb.ae/rooms/1343306454982850454)

* Great reviews
* Artsy interiors
* Walkable location near key sights

🔍 Before I book, I just want to double-check:

1. **Is this listing legit?** Any tips on verifying Airbnb listings in Georgia?
2. **Is it really worth the price?** Or are there similar options you'd recommend?

I’m mainly interested in:

* Exploring the **historic**, **artistic**, and **cultural** side of Tbilisi
* Local art galleries, museums, hidden cafes, creative spaces, traditional crafts, etc.
* Authentic local experiences over touristy ones

 I'd also appreciate a **rough estimate of daily expenses** for a comfortable solo trip — including food, entry tickets, and maybe a few treats.

Since I’m celebrating my **birthday solo**, I’m hoping to make it special:

* Any suggestions for **birthday-friendly spots** — rooftop dinners, wine tastings, art events, or something specific for birthdays?
* Anything **seasonal** I should look out for if I’m visiting in June end?

Thanks in advance! I’m so excited to experience Tbilisi’s charm — any help is truly appreciated. ❤️

1l26m8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1l26m8e/ive_never_even_been_with_an_attractive_guy/,I've never even been with an attractive guy,"So tired of the internet always telling me that women only date attractive guys. It's always ""you/women choose the attractive guy that every woman wants that give them tingles and they all ignore the ordinary guys"" or ""it's impossible for ordinary guys to find a girlfriend"". People have been saying this for 7 years.

I'm so sick of it!!! I've literally never dated an attractive guy. Ever. All my boyfriends were short, didn't gym, and were completely small and unremarkable. I don't even know what it's like to be with a hot guy. Will men ever stop bitching that all women have been with hot guys?

Not only that, but I never had any standards. I never minded if the guy was short, unemployed, poor, shy, introverted, quiet, unpopular, not smart and not successful, didn't have a car, didn't pay on dates, didn't organize dates, didn't give me gifts, didn't provide any lifestyle upgrade for me. I had zero criteria! And I always did things their way 100%, adapting myself to what they wanted in the relationship. And yet men are telling me that I need to lower my standards *further*??? Because everyone is bitching all the time that women have too high standards and that the poor men can't find girlfriends??? Are you kidding me???

And the most important part: the problem was never that a guy was too short, too ugly or didn't make enough money. I don't care about these things. There were OTHER things that made them shitty boyfriends. Emotionally and spiritually they were bankrupt, selfish and rude.

The internet (controlled by men) pushes only two scenarios: 

1. ""my boyfriend is literally the best person I know and he treats me so well but I'm just not attracted to him because he's too short and doesn't make enough money :/""

2. ""my boyfriend is horrible to me and doesn't care about me, but I don't want him to leave me because he's 6'2 and he makes a lot more money than me ToT""

I am here to tell you there's so much more than those two scenarios. For me it's always been that I don't care that the guy is short, ugly and poor, and the actual problem is that the guy treats me like shit and is a bad person. 

To give you an example of what I mean by treat me like shit, I could tell you about my first boyfriend. He was a shy unpopular guy who was friends with the other reject boys in school. Our first date was at a coffee shop and I got there myself because he didn't have a car and I paid for my own drink and he cried big rolling tears telling me failed classes and got held back. So much for the ""men must never cry"" bullshit. Then he interrupted the date to say his friend wanted to hang out. We ended up in their neighborhood with gin and they made me pay a third without leaving me a choice and I went to sleep on the couch and they carried me to his bed and he raped me. After that the relationship was so disrespectful. He only hung out with me to fuck me. Any time I planned for us to do an activity or spend an evening together, he would call me saying he ""forgot"" and he was with the boys and he couldn't bail on them now. Every. Single. Time. I'm not even a clingy girl. I'm super low maintenance and independent. We never went on dates and he never paid for me. But he kept pulling that crap on me. The activities I planned with him were absolutely free and it was stuff he liked. But it was just ""uncool"" to spend time with his girlfriend. So he spent every night getting drunk with his friends somewhere. He didn't invite me to invite with them other than the first date where he raped me. He only saw me to fuck me. And the sex was so traumatizing, painful and dehumanizing. He was always all over me, always horny, always forcing me to do stuff I didn't want to do, always pushing me until I was crying in fear and deep desperation. Then he would usually stop and laugh it off, like it was funny he did horrible things to me until I cried. Then he would do the exact same thing the next time. He didn't give a shit. But he always played the shy embarrassed boy act. Never any bad intentions. I was always there for him, helping him in various ways, preparing nice little gestures for him, being his shoulder to cry on (he cried a lot) and fucking him, but he was never there in return. He was selfish, never showing up when it mattered, and then showing up when it was inconvenient for me, like late before my exams. His combo of abusing me in the bedroom + never being there in a meaningful way eventually eroded me and eventually I just didn't care anymore and didn't want to be with him anymore. I felt nothing. You know what he did? He started saying I was the best thing that's ever happened to him and I made him so happy and he just couldn't lose me. Odd how when he felt secure and I kept making him feel loved and accepted he didn't give a shit, invented reasons to bail on me, laughed with his friends about it, raped me, never showed up for the important stuff, but the second I was done with it, suddenly he was trying to set up activities with me, he was offering several options where he'd be free, and he was saying how great I was. 

Anyway, it's always like this, and the guy is not even hot, and it feels a lot like I exist just to make some short working class guy happy, and it doesn't fly high. I'm someone who put maximum effort (being nice, fit, not clingy, understanding, supportive, loving, working out every day, getting professional bikini waxes done, dressing nicely, taking things well and not creating conflicts, getting a good career so we have money in the future) and maybe they also put maximum effort but their maximum effort was low! In the end just zero benefit for me. You can say I get sex every time they get sex, but if the sex is always exactly their choice, we have to do exactly what they like, and they always have orgasms and they like it, and for me it's just painful, humiliating, stressful, harmful, it's more of a negative for me. I'm not someone who counts in orgasms, but if you must know, of course they never gave me any. So what does a boyfriend provide? Occasional companionship. That was it. Very occasional, unreliable and unsupportive. Like sometimes we had times together were we laughed and had inside jokes. So that was that. A bit of laughing around / superficial friendship.

Emotional support? Never. My boyfriends have been completely emotionally unintelligent and incapable of providing the slightest emotional support. I had a boyfriend who said ""I don't like it when a girl cries, I feel like it's manipulative"". So with him, any hint of a sad demeanor would be met with a huge stink eye and disgust. I had to be bubbly all the time or he would punish me. Nevermind that he was a gloomy character himself. With another boyfriend, when I told him ""I've been feeling pretty bad these days"", he replied with a whiny and angry voice ""why are you telling me that, stop it, I don't want to hear that stuff, this is gonna make me feel bad"".

The thing is, people see the occasional coffee, sweets and alcoholic drink as a reward. You have to treat yourself now and then, right? It's the freedom of choice, it's the spice of life. 
But from my point of view these vices are what keep me anxious. I can't control myself when I'm around them and see them as literal poison now. These things are not giving me freedom, it's what keeps me chained to stress. 
I made a vow to myself one year ago that no matter what I'm going to reduce stress in my life and quitting is one of the ways in going about it.

I (27M) have been married to my wife (26F) for almost a year. I come from a very religious family, and I observed it seriously until a few years ago. She is not religious, period. 

My family (her in-laws) visited us in the country we are living in. It was nice to see the typical tourist destinations together but it was very tense. Here is why:

A year ago I brought up my feelings about how my father and mother raised me, to my father and mother. I felt like they were unnecessarily rough with me in a misguided attempt to discipline me. Honestly, it was scary growing up there and I realized many of my adult friends did not experience that level of roughness, and I realized it has negatively impacted my self-esteem and overall wellbeing. It was one of the reasons I gave up my faith.

Predictably, my parents did not respond well. I worded my concerns as gently as I could, focusing on our future which just meant I needed to see them acknowledge a hostile pattern that in many ways still affects the relationship today. They had good reasons to be stressed out during my childhood, and I bent over backwards to see things from their perspective. I had assumed they also felt their behavior was, at least on a moment to moment basis, shameful back then. But I was deeply wrong; this disconnect shook me to my core. 

I had built them up in my mind for over a decade as decent people who simply made mistakes, were too ashamed to admit it, but fundamentally still cared about me. Unfortunately, our discussion convinced me otherwise.

Back to the trip— (yes, it is an em dash in the wild, this is a real post and I have real feelings)

I wanted to cancel it immediately after the discussion with them. They (my wife and parents) had been planning it for ages, but my wife convinced me to cool down and just get through it. 

One of the reasons I actually faced our past head-on was to clear the air so the trip could be enjoyable, because I was afraid I would unload on them without control. Nightmares and rogue emotions had been growing more and more un-suppressable is the only way to put it. Curiously, since facing them, those emotions have gradually begun to settle and heal.

So they came. Okay. I was calm and polite and friendly. My father asked me on the second day if he could give my wife a holy book and I calmly told him not to do that because I wanted her to feel accepted in our family. Pushing their religion might make her feel ""not good enough"" ya know? And she's good enough. She's amazing. I'm lucky to even know her.

A few days later, when my dad thought I was gone, I overheard him trying to convert her. Going on about prophecies and how to pray. He uses a bizarre, pseudo-guru voice-whisper when he gets like this, as if he believes he's sent by heaven. Good for him! I was furious he attempted this with my wife. Yes, he offered her the bible but she did not accept it.

Again, she asked me to cool down, and I tried but it was noticable this time. I was very silent because I worried that if I spoke it would be harsh. She is a grown woman and she can handle her issues and she told me if she wanted him/them to be rejected more fiercely, she would have done it. Yes, my mother also knew about my dad's plan.

So we were out sitting together. A giant dead Jesus-on-the-cross (like 10 meters long and 3 meters wide) was being carried horizontally by some people outside our window, down the street. I made some crack about him looking like he needs some coffee or something (it was not offensive, they were not offended).

At that point, my dad starts having a side conversation with my wife referencing his earlier attempt to proselytize. Something about prophecies. He's basically winking at her as if she is ""in"" on it, but that is just because she was being polite and a good listener. She took her afternoon off with PTO to guide them while I did an essential errand and they took advantage of her graciousness.

So it's right in front of me and I am pissed again. I just said ""I think I'm feeling a bit tired I guess we can go home [to our separate places] and call it a night tonight"" and they all looked a bit disappointed but, my dad I guess instantly knew and started going ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, can you forgive me?"" I just curtly said ""no"" because I felt so fed up and obviously he was apologizing without understanding what/why on a deeper level.

We walk out on the street and he is all moody and asking ""why"" now, so, fuck it, I unloaded a bit. About how I gave them years of chances, about not wanting the trip to happen, about not feeling like I had a seat at the table like my sister and brother. At first he is denying the conversion attempts but then in his guru voice said *""she wants to know her creator""* and I was like ""no, again, she was just being polite and you took advantage of that. She's all I've got, I've had her less than a year. And what if she accepted it? We would not last together, but I know you didn't think about that because my happiness took second place to your spiritual goals."" 

I asked him if he understood why I'm upset, that was all I was looking for in that moment. I understood proselytizing was a way to offer something 'nice' from his POV but I had expressly asked him not to.

He started crying. He said yes he understood. Saying I should punch him. Saying how he's just been fumbling around his whole life. How much he loves me. I hugged him, said I loved him, and switched my tone and cheerfully asked if they wanted to come back to our place for ice cream. 

Honestly, it was like talking to a baby. He's getting older and his memory is starting to slip pretty bad. And the way his mind has been wrapped around one political or religious delusion for decades, I'm sure that hasn't helped his critical thinking or emotional self awareness. But that's not my job. My old man flew across the world, acted predictably, and I made him cry. I've been feeling guilty recently. So, AITA?",4,1748939133.0,AITAH,3,0.83,False

Wheatgrass kept popping up in wellness circles, juice bars, and even green smoothie kits I’d buy online—but I never gave it a real chance. People claimed it boosts energy, improves digestion, clears up your skin, and even detoxifies your body. Honestly, it sounded a little too good to be true.

So, I challenged myself to drink a wheatgrass smoothie every morning for 7 days straight. No skipping, no shortcuts. Just one full glass of green goodness each day. My goal wasn’t perfection—I just wanted to see if I’d notice any difference in how I felt, especially in terms of energy, digestion, and mental clarity. What happened over the course of those seven days definitely surprised me… and some of it wasn’t what I expected.

# [What Is Wheatgrass and Why Is It So Hyped?](https://moringawellness.org/wheatgrass-smoothie/)

Before I started my 7-day wheatgrass smoothie challenge, I wanted to understand what exactly I was putting into my body. Wheatgrass is the young, freshly sprouted leaves of the common wheat plant (Triticum aestivum). It’s typically harvested when it’s just a few inches tall—right at its nutritional peak. You can find it fresh, juiced, or in powdered form, which is what I used for convenience.

Wheatgrass is often called a “superfood” because it’s packed with nutrients like chlorophyll, iron, calcium, magnesium, amino acids, vitamins A, C, and E, and enzymes that are thought to help the body detoxify. Some wellness experts swear by it for everything from boosting immunity to clearing skin and supporting digestion. That hype definitely got my attention—and I was curious to see if it actually lived up to it.

# How I Prepared My Daily Wheatgrass Smoothie recipe

A glass of green barley grass juice, with freshly grown barleygrass in the background

I wanted to keep things simple and consistent throughout the 7 days, so I created a base smoothie recipe that I tweaked only slightly depending on what I had in my fridge. I used **wheatgrass powder** instead of fresh juice—mainly because it was easier to store, cheaper, and still packed with nutrients.

# My Go-To Wheatgrass Smoothie Recipe:

* 1 tsp organic wheatgrass powder
* 1 frozen banana
* 1/2 cup frozen pineapple or mango (for sweetness)
* 1 cup spinach or kale
* 1 cup unsweetened almond milk
* 1 tbsp chia seeds (for fiber and texture)
* 1 tsp honey or maple syrup (optional)

I blended everything together for about 30–45 seconds until it was completely smooth. I’ll be honest—wheatgrass has a strong, earthy taste, but with banana and pineapple, it actually became pretty enjoyable. Some days I’d toss in a scoop of protein powder or a few ice cubes if I wanted it extra cold.

Sticking to this morning routine helped me start each day with something green and nourishing—and it definitely made me more mindful about my health. I was excited to see how my body would respond.

# Day-by-Day Experience: What I Noticed Each Morning

# Day 1: First Impressions

The very first morning, I was a bit nervous about the taste. Wheatgrass is known for its strong, grassy flavor, and I wasn’t sure how my smoothie would turn out. Thankfully, the banana and pineapple masked the earthiness pretty well. After finishing the glass, I felt a slight boost of alertness, but honestly, I wasn’t sure if it was placebo or real. Still, it was a refreshing way to start the day, and I felt proud of myself for sticking to the plan.

# Day 2: Slight Boost in Energy

On day two, I noticed I wasn’t reaching for my usual mid-morning coffee quite as quickly. The smoothie gave me a subtle but steady energy lift that lasted longer than the caffeine buzz I’m used to. I also felt less bloated, which was a nice surprise since I sometimes struggle with digestion after breakfast.

# Day 3: Digestive Changes

By the third day, my digestion seemed smoother. I usually have occasional tummy discomfort, but this week, it was much less frequent. I felt lighter and less sluggish after meals. Plus, my bathroom routine was more regular, which is always a good sign. I was starting to believe the detox claims might have some truth.

# Day 4: Cravings and Mood

Midweek, I noticed my cravings for sugary snacks dropped significantly. I attributed this to the nutrient-rich smoothie filling me up and stabilizing my blood sugar. Mood-wise, I felt calmer and less jittery during stressful moments. It was subtle, but I appreciated the steadiness.

# Day 5: Energy Plateau

On day five, the energy boost was steady but not as noticeable as the first few days. I figured my body was adjusting. However, I still felt less fatigued in the afternoons, which made my workdays more productive. I also realized that the ritual of having the smoothie helped me stay mindful about eating healthy the rest of the day.

# Day 6: Skin Improvements?

I caught myself checking my reflection more often because my skin looked clearer and had a healthy glow. I don’t usually see quick changes like that, so I was excited. While I can’t say for sure it was 100% the wheatgrass smoothie, it definitely coincided with this experiment.

# Day 7: Final Day Reflection

By the last day, drinking the wheatgrass smoothie felt natural—a part of my morning routine rather than a chore. I had more consistent energy, better digestion, fewer cravings, and a positive mood overall. While I didn’t feel like a superhero, I did feel healthier and more balanced. This 7-day challenge gave me enough reason to keep wheatgrass smoothies in my rotation—maybe not daily, but definitely a few times a week.

# Physical & Mental Benefits I Experienced

After a week of drinking wheatgrass smoothies every morning, I definitely noticed some positive changes in both my body and mind. Physically, the first thing I felt was a more consistent energy level throughout the day. Unlike my usual energy crashes after coffee or sugary snacks, the energy from the wheatgrass smoothie was steady and natural. I felt less fatigued, especially during those mid-afternoon slumps, which made my workdays smoother and more productive.

Digestively, my body seemed to respond really well. My bloating decreased, and I experienced more regular digestion, which helped me feel lighter and less sluggish. I believe the fiber and enzymes in the wheatgrass played a big role in this. Another unexpected benefit was clearer, more glowing skin—I’m guessing the antioxidant properties of wheatgrass helped reduce inflammation and promote skin health.

Mentally, I found I was a bit calmer and more focused, especially in stressful moments. While I can’t say wheatgrass magically improved my mood overnight, it seemed to reduce the jitteriness I sometimes get from caffeine and helped me maintain a steady mental clarity. Overall, these combined effects made me feel healthier and more balanced by the end of the week.

# Unexpected Side Effects (The Good & The Bad)

While most of my experience with wheatgrass smoothies was positive, I did encounter a few unexpected side effects—some pleasant, some a little less so.

**The Good:**  
Around day three, I noticed a mild detox effect. I felt slightly more tired than usual in the evening and experienced a bit of a headache one afternoon. After some quick research, I learned this is common for beginners when introducing chlorophyll-rich foods like wheatgrass. It’s your body adjusting and flushing out toxins, which actually reassured me that the smoothies were doing something behind the scenes. Thankfully, this lasted only a day or two and quickly passed.

Another good surprise was improved hydration. Drinking a smoothie with water-rich ingredients like pineapple and almond milk combined with wheatgrass seemed to help me stay better hydrated throughout the day. I also noticed my breath was fresher—something I didn’t expect but definitely appreciated.

**The Bad:**  
On the flip side, the strong grassy flavor wasn’t always easy to handle. Some mornings, I had to add extra fruit or honey to make it more palatable, which slightly increased the sugar content. Also, on two occasions, I felt mild stomach discomfort shortly after drinking the smoothie. It wasn’t severe, but it reminded me to start slow when introducing new superfoods and listen to my body.

Lastly, wheatgrass powder can be a bit pricey and not always easy to find fresh, which might make it less accessible for some people looking to try this.

I’m f16 and I got my first job in last July because my mom made me get a job when I turned 16. Once I got a job my mom told me that I could afford to pay for things myself. It was a big change for me. My paychecks are biweekly and I make around 600 sometimes 300 (if it’s bad). But it drives me nuts. I am saving for a car and college right now but it’s impossible to save when i’m financially independent. My mom has me paying for my insurance, phone bill, groceries, food hygiene products. I barely have enough money to save at the end of the week. I know this sounds stupid but everything is so expensive. I constantly feel so stressed out about how i’m gonna afford things like I literally haven’t seen my friends in 3 weeks because i’ve been working to pay for everything as simple as a razor to shave.

Last week I spent 160 buying a dresser for my room because I had just been stacking my clothes on the floor for the past 2 years. But then after that I couldn’t even afford to save any money for my car. I was gonna spend time with my friends that week too but had to cancel because I knew I wouldn’t have enough money to pay the phone bill. I know it sounds stupid and I know eventually this is almost everyone’s reality. But it’s just draining i’m 16 years old in high school watching my friends not have to worry about simple things like affording a coffee or going out. While I scramble to make deadlines for school projects because I work late or can’t even afford a candy bar until friday. I seriously need saving tips, I can never buy anything I want it’s always constantly needs. 

Yeah the upside is that I don’t have to ask my mom for anything but the downside is that I feel like i’m losing my teenage experience. I have given up tennis and lacrosse two of the sports i’d been playing for the past 8 years of my life just to pay for everything. Don’t get me wrong my mom is an amazing parent but she’s just really heavy on me being financially independent.

I'm keeping this vague to avoid identification. Every year, my wife asks what I want for fathers day, and every year I'm surprised. First, some context.
I am the sole provider of income in our household. I do not make enough for this to be possible. Therefore I usually work overtime when it's available. My average work weeks are 50-55 hours. I go to school twice a week in hopes to change this. My household responsibilities are washing dishes, doing laundry, picking up/dropping off kids at school, and being a dad (spending time with kids). It does not leave a lot of time for myself. I maybe get 2-3 hours a week for my own hobbies, which lately is doom scrolling tiktok. My wifes responsibilities include getting the kids ready for school in the morning,(I work nights and get home just in time to take them in) tidying up the house, helping with homework, and spending time with the kids when they aren't with me. Cooking is split between us, but cleaning afterwards is always on me. For mothers day, her birthday, and our anniversary, I let her have the day to herself. If she wants to spend the day playing video games, the TV is hers. If she wants to read, the kids will be busy with me. If she does not get her way, I get comments from her, ""I just want one day to relax!"" Or ""why is it when you want a day, no one will bother you, but when it's my day, mom's always busy!"" I let her sleep in as long as she likes, and provided I don't need to run errands (I'm the only one who does the shopping) I'll make her coffee and breakfast, too. On my days off, I'm the one who gets up with the kids and makes them breakfast (always, without fail). When my wife asks what I want for my birthday or fathers day, the answers always the same. Nothing. I want to sleep in. I want to relax. I don't want to shoulder all the responsibilities for a day.
Every year it's the same.
Are the dishes done for me? No, the sinks always full.
Did the laundry get done? No, the hampers are always overflowing.
Do I get to sleep in? So far, in the last 10 years, the answer was yes, once, maybe twice.
But I do get gifts. Headphones for gaming. That's nice, but I don't really get to play much. Dungeons and dragons stuff, awesome but I never get to go and play with anyone. Unique trinkets and bits n bobs? Got plenty of those. Dinner will be on her, she'll ask what I want and typically it's ordered from my choice of restaurant. Do I get to play video games all day? Sometimes. If the kids don't demand my attention. Sometimes they get very insistent to play with daddy, and mom will never step in and try to do something with them. She'll tell them to leave daddy alone, and then complain when they get upset because they're bored, so I'll put the controller down, and sit and play with them. If I argue about it, I'm told ""you wouldn't be a father without kids so take the time to enjoy it with them on fathers day"".
What do I want for fathers day? A rest. A nap. Let me sleep in past 7. Let me close my eyes for a moment. Let me just breath.

The difference was, she was constantly wired. Like… jittery, anxious, snappy, barely sleeping. She drank 4-5 cups of coffee minimum every day and swore she “needed it” to function.

One night, after another fight over something stupid (she got mad that I left a spoon in the sink), I snapped. Not outwardly — I just made a decision. I started secretly switching her coffee with decaf. Every morning, I’d wake up early, clean out the grounds, and brew a fresh pot using decaf beans I bought specifically for this plan.

The first few days, she was crankier than usual. Then… weirdly calmer. Less anxiety, more sleep. She even started journaling and going for runs in the evening. Our relationship improved. She started calling her mom again. She even said, “I think I’m finally finding some balance.”

I should’ve felt guilty. But I didn’t. Not really.

After a month, I stopped. Went back to letting her make her own coffee. Within a week, she was a mess again. Shaky hands, snapping at everyone, sleeping three hours a night. She never figured it out. Still hasn’t.

I don’t know what that makes me — manipulative? Helpful? A monster with good intentions?

Sometimes I think about telling her. But what do I even say? “Hey, remember that month you thought you had your life together? That was just me playing God with your caffeine intake.”

Yeah… no thanks.

## Key Features Analysis

The overall quality and convenience of a glass drink dispenser is heavily influenced by its features. Careful consideration of these features is essential when exploring options.

**Capacity:** A critical consideration is the dispenser's volume. Glass drink dispensers typically come in sizes ranging from one gallon to three gallons or more. The ideal capacity depends on the size of gatherings you typically host.

A larger capacity dispenser is suitable for events with many guests, reducing the frequency of refills. Smaller dispensers are better suited for intimate gatherings or everyday use, offering a manageable amount of beverage without taking up too much space. Some dispensers are also stackable or come in sets offering multiple sizes.

**Spigot Material and Design:** The spigot is arguably the most crucial part of a drink dispenser. A high-quality spigot ensures a smooth,leak-free pour every time. Common materials include stainless steel, plastic, and chrome.

Stainless steel spigots are generally considered the most durable and hygienic, as thay are resistant to corrosion and easy to clean. Plastic spigots are more affordable but may be less durable and prone to leaking over time. The design should allow for easy operation, even with one hand, and prevent drips or spills. Some dispensers come with specialized spigots designed for specific types of beverages,such as those with pulp or fruit pieces.**Glass Quality and Durability:** The quality of the glass used in the dispenser determines its durability and aesthetic appeal. High-quality glass is less likely to chip or crack and is also more resistant to temperature changes.

Thicker glass provides greater insulation, helping to keep beverages cold for longer periods. Look for dispensers made from borosilicate glass, which is known for its remarkable durability and resistance to thermal shock. Pay attention to the seams and joints of the glass to ensure they are smooth and well-sealed to prevent leaks.**Base and Stability:** The base of the drink dispenser plays a critical role in its stability and overall safety. A sturdy base prevents the dispenser from tipping over, especially when filled with liquid.Materials like wrought iron, wood, or heavy-duty plastic are commonly used for bases as they provide excellent support. The base should also be designed to elevate the dispenser slightly, making it easier to access the spigot without having to bend over. Some dispensers come with non-slip feet to further enhance stability.

**Lid Design and Functionality:** The lid of a drink dispenser serves to keep beverages fresh and prevent contaminants from entering. A well-designed lid should fit securely on the dispenser without being too difficult to remove or replace.

Materials like glass, stainless steel, or plastic are commonly used for lids, with stainless steel offering superior durability and hygiene. The lid should also have a wide opening to facilitate easy filling and cleaning. Some dispensers come with lids that feature a built-in ice compartment or a ventilation system to prevent condensation.

Key Features of the glass drink dispensers include:

* Various Capacity options
* High-Quality Spigot
* Durable Glass
* Sturdy and Stable Base
* Functional Lid Design

My last guess was right (Id like to thank my friends, family, etc). I said ""he's lazy, I think he's going to stay in hotels"".
In his house he was staring at same walls each day and doing nothing but logging on. He can do that anywhere. Having L nearby would be horrible. IF he eg took walks or little trips into town he is at risk of seeing them. This would only go badly. 
I can see him starting a holiday style lifestyle staying in various hotels and 'spas', BUT it's a question of how he affords. 
When they first separated he vlogged that he didn't have two ha'pennies to rub together. He was pleading for people to buy him a coffee and then later to join Patreon. 
Does anyone reckon that L has been giving him an allowance? Does she for sure pay for 'his' house?
He is completely unwilling to ever listen to any 'authority' and I think he hasn't gone to court re houses because he just refuses to contemplate being told by anyone that 'this is the court order'. Same for the upcoming hearing.
He was/is probably entitled to half of their community property. He did have success as a composer, in the past. 
Hotel life seems to be a perfect fit for someone who has 'no friends' and who's very lazy.
