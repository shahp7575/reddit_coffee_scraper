I need ideas for this space since it has so many open doors and areas etc I am struggling to plan a cozy setting. Here are some things I already have in mind: 

I plan to change the rug, would get a bigger one in some warm tone. 
Add a small coffee table. 
Also planning on getting a dining table for six. Maybe a bookrack.

1q03o8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1q03o8w/i_thought_that_call_was_over_then_i_heard_it_again/,I Thought That Call Was Over — Then I Heard It Again,"Most people think once something weird ends, it’s done. Memories fade. Screens clear. Old calls scroll out of sight.

That’s not how this worked.

It started two nights after the active call from that address — the one we never resolved, the one with two simultaneous lines and the voice that sounded wrong — the station was quiet. Too quiet. Graveyard shift, slow shuffle of paperwork, the usual half‑hearted attempts at coffee. I had my headset off for the first time in hours.

Then the headset clicked on by itself.

No call tone. No ringing. Just connected.

I put it on like a dumb habit.

“911, what’s your emergency?” I said out of instinct.

There was breathing.
That slow, controlled breathing — like someone pacing their own heartbeat.

Then a voice I’d never heard before said:

“I heard your voice before.”

I froze.

Not because of what was said, but how it was said.

It didn’t sound afraid.
It didn’t sound frantic.

It sounded… familiar.

Like someone who had listened for years.

I checked the line number.

Blank.
No caller ID.
No trunk line.
Just an active call — already in progress — with no record of having been dialed.

My blood went cold.

“Sir,” I said slowly, “are you safe right now?”

There was a pause. Then the breathing changed: slow exhale, as if someone was leaning back and relaxing.

“I am now,” the voice said.

My eyes went to the system screen.

A new active call entry showed up. Timestamp: 2:17 a.m.
Location: DISPATCH CENTER
Caller Number: Unknown
Status: Open

The system was showing me as the caller.

I didn’t hit anything. I hadn’t made a call.

I stared at it.

Then I heard something else through the headset.

Soft footsteps. Bare feet. Slow.

Like someone was pacing behind me in the dispatch room.

I turned around.

Nothing there.

“Sir,” I said into the headset, “can you tell me where you are?”

A chuckle. Calm. Quiet.

“No. But I’m close.”

Another breath.
Another slow footstep, but this time it echoed in the audio — behind the voice.

I pressed Mute on my mic to check if it was local.

The footsteps didn’t stop.

That’s when the voice spoke again — right into the mic, not through the phone system:

“You remember me.”

My headset buzzed violently, like a feedback loop.

Then — silence.

Everything froze.

The active call entry blinked and disappeared.

No log.
No record.
No sound.

Just the hum of fluorescent lights.

I sat there, trembling, waiting for dispatch to catch up.

Then the headset clicked off.

Like nothing had happened.

I looked around the empty station.

And I noticed something on my monitor I hadn’t seen before:

A third open call, timestamped 2:17 a.m.,
With the label:

“DISPATCHER — UNKNOWN LOCATION.”

I stared at it for a long time.

Then, slowly, the line reconnected.

No ringing. No caller ID.

Just breathing.

Slow. Controlled.

Too close.

“911,” I whispered, “what’s your emergency?”

The same calm voice I’d heard before said,
“…You have a new caller.”

And right then — something tapped, very gently, on the back of my chair.

Not heavy. Not loud.

Just there.

Like it was waiting for me to acknowledge it.

And then the breathing changed — not through the headset —
but behind me.

Slow. Measured.

Like someone breathing into the back of my neck.

I didn’t turn around.

Because I already knew the shape of what was there.

Because it wasn’t just a call anymore.

It was watching.",1,1767154952.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Any advice?","So I'm on week 6 of Ozempic.. (5 weeks on, 1 week off, due to my doc's advice.) I was 4 weeks on 0.25 mgs.. And then I was on 1 week of 0.5 mgs.. But I have a problem. I can't drink enough water to stay hydrated.

  
In my area I live in the mountains and the snow started falling heavily, and one day about 4 weeks ago I spat in my toilet only for blood to come out. I checked my thermostat and it said my humidity was down to 48%.. So I popped on my humidifier and got it to 58%. And went to bed..

  
Now fast forward about 2 weeks later I noticed I literally couldn't drink enough water to stay hydrated. And another day with 48% humidity happened and I spat up blood again..

  
Now I'm 1 week off Ozempic, and I checked my apartment's humidity and it was 28% but I felt perfectly fine.

  
Honestly I do want to get back on Ozempic.. But how can I drink enough water whilst on it? (Assuming I maintain the humidity in my apartment.)

  
I literally get so full I cannot drink another drop of water, and I feel like I'm gonna burst. I eat maybe once every 3 days, and drink a water bottle or 2 the other days. I don't drink coffee, and I don't use energy drinks.

  
Before I went on Ozempic I normally drank about 3 to 4 lbs of water a day.. My doctor said if I kept taking Ozempic I should get better.. but I should go on a break while we get my neuropathy under control.

  
(I wasn't sleeping very good at the time too since my feet pain was waking me up every night but the new dose of Gabapentin I'm on really helped..)



  
Anyways in short any tips on how to stay better hydrated on a low amount of water while I get through the initial phase of Ozempic. Any help would be much appreciated. My doctor is very insistent that I should take Ozempic. (My blood works had pretty great results I guess.) Plus I can save money on food, since I make minimum wage, I can't even afford a car or the insurance with it, as I live pretty much paycheck by paycheck.)

I understand the US is a unique place with our tipping culture, and i understand that other cultures even see tipping as an insult. I understand the argument for not tipping for things like a simple coffee, a package delivery, an airport kiosk (saw that today, wtf), and fast food “service”, but given that our culture has for a very long time tipped for sit-down restaurant service, why are people so against it?

From my perspective, tipping doesn’t just subsidize server wages, it keeps things cheaper than they otherwise would be because of the fact that you have the option to not tip. 

Would you not prefer paying $30 for a meal and paying a $3 tip over paying $36 for the same meal? (included 20% price bump)

Also, if your service was great you can reward them directly through a higher tip, and if your service was terrible you can tip $0.01 as a punishment. 

As far as i see it, you are paying the same money either way, just with tipping you can directly impact incentives to make service better. ",2,1767154805.0,EndTipping,11,0.75,False

She and my son (M40) have been together for 6 years. She (let's call her ""B"") has it very good IMO. My son (let's call him ""T"") works and we both provide for many of B's needs/wants. Sincec she isn't working, all we ask is that she help around the house; not even do it all in her own. Just help. This is what she considers helping: Loading the dishwasher and unloading when dishes are clean. Taking out the garbage. (My son has to help B do this because she let's the garbage build to a point where she can't do it in her own.) Keep the bathroom clean. (On days when she does any of these tasks, that's the only thing she'll do all day.) I am disabled and can't do these things or much of anything household related, but I do the cooking and pay most of the bills. T is currently working part-time until he can find another full-time gig. His salary takes care of food, topping up his phone, and streaming services. What baffles me is that she thinks that keeping him sexually satisfied is enough to keep him happy. I am the one who makes his lunch and sets up the coffee for the next morning. When I cook, it's for everyone. When B cooks it's for herself. Her excuse is that T is picky with regards to what he will eat (he is), she doesn't always want to eat what he wants to eat and it's too much work to make two meals. Both of us have REPEATEDLY spoken with her about this (separately), to no avail. In my conversations with her, I come from a POV that she should try to help T more since he's not insisting she find a job. T is reluctant to break it off with B (believe me he's so over her) because when they started seeing each other she was homeless. (We've been homeless and know what it's like out there.) I do my DAMNEDEST to keep out of their relationship. But since I live with them and their relationship ""issues"" are becoming MY issues...

1q03lr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaboAllInclusive/comments/1q03lr4/breathless_cabo_san_lucas_december_2025_review/,Breathless - Cabo San Lucas - December 2025 Review,"Hello! We recently stayed at Breathless Cabo for 4 days in late December 2025 as part of our Honeymoon, so I figured I would leave a review here for anyone considering this property. We are a couple in our early 30s.

Food: 3/5

As far as resort food goes, I would say this is above average, but nothing amazing. We tried almost all of the restaurants on-site during our stay, and our favorite meal was a nice dinner at the Mexican restaurant Ocote. We also enjoyed the Nook coffee shop on-site for getting beverages throughout the day. Apart from that, the food was quite average or unimpressive. We spent a few days at a non all-inclusive property after leaving the resort, and the tastier restaurants around Cabo really highlighted how average the food at Breathless is.

Drinks: 2.5/5

We had a few cocktails each day, and were never really able to taste any alcohol in them. They are quite sweet/watered down. We never really had to wait in a line for a drink which was nice. Neither of us are huge drinkers so it didn't really affect our experience at the resort, but we do prefer high-quality craft cocktails when we drink, and you will have to leave the property to get a truly great cocktail.

Rooms: 4.5

This hotel was designed in a smart way, so all rooms get an amazing view of the marina. We really enjoyed spending time relaxing in the room, including taking advantage of the balcony and that stunning view. The TV was a nice size and the shower had great water pressure. It was definitely not the most modern, luxury room, but we had no complaints.

Service: 4/5

In general the staff was great, and we didn't run into any issues with people trying to sell us timeshares on the property or anything like that. At check-in, they did offer to upgrade us to the Xhale Club for an additional fee, which we declined after having read about the benefits prior to arrival. Our only hiccup - on the day we arrived, it took 10-15 minutes to get seated for dinner as it seemed they were down a staff member at the time, so we were just standing at the host station with a few other people waiting. But the other nights it was not an issue. All the staff members were helpful and professional during our stay.

Activities: 3.5/5

Keep in mind this is an adults-only resort, which we appreciated as a couple with no children. In terms of entertainment, the resort definitely had options, such as karaoke, silent disco, dancing lessons, etc, however there was very minimal participation in these activities. Overall, the resort seemed quite empty most of the time we were there, despite it being peak season in Cabo (Christmas week). Many guests seemed to be off the property in general, which is always an option if you're into the party or nightlife scene.

Overall: 4/5

We enjoyed our stay as a couple who are not heavy drinkers or party people. We were mostly looking to just relax for a few days before moving to a non all-inclusive property so we could fully enjoy the restaurants and local spots in the city. The food is decent for an all-inclusive resort and the staff are great!",2,1767154743.0,CaboAllInclusive,0,1.0,False

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

So how do we do this? Coffee in a cute café filled with gingerbread smells? A day spent talking till the lights come on? A Christmas movie marathon with fuzzy socks? Let’s connect. Let me get to know you.

It's now been a year.

It's been a year since that night that my emotions came crashing down.

As the bell turned to 2025, and you weren't next to me.

I was filled with such immense sorrow, I tried to find you, but you shut me out.

I should've given up.

I should've accepted everything was over so I didn't have to suffer your delusions.

As 2025 comes to an end.

I prepare for that second sorrow.

The sorrow of knowing I won't hear from you as the clock turns to 2026.

The sorrow of the permanence of a year passed.

The sorrow of the truth that I am stepping into an unknown future that does not involve you.

The sorrow of my resolve to turn my heart to stone because you left me cold and abandoned in the most cruel way I’ve ever experienced.

The sorrow of finally…. Giving up.   And committing to never committing to you again.

I know I’m capable of it but that’s just how much I liked the side of you that was my real partner.  That’s why I held out longer than I should’ve.

I've come to terms with it, but I do know the feeling of the bell ringing without you at my side, will summon the last bits of misery left to mourn in our connection.

I spoke to an old classmate today over coffee.

She left a man around the same time that we ended things.

She said she was over it.

I thought about it and said.  ""I'm about 90% there"".

Because I know the tears might come if I am alone at that embarking of the new year.

However.

Confidently I can say, I know I will be okay.

So I won't shed any tears for you.

I'll raise my glass in your name as the clock turns.

If I'm alone, then I will say farewell to the woman I loved and look to the future.

If I find me and another woman find each other by fate.

I will say goodbye before the year ends in my mind and spirit.

As the clock approaches 10.  I will erase all traces that you have access to.

I will be as invisible to you as you are to me.

I will be truly.

A ghost.

I know you watch my stories, I see you, briefly, before your profile disappears.  But Instagram still reveals the non follower (you) on the algorithm.

Tomorrow.  That ends.

I’ve finally rid myself of the large furniture of yours.

Any remains.

The coffee mugs.

The socks.

The trinkets.

I can’t hold them anymore.  They had to go.

With this new year, I must be a new man.

Loving you this year brought me nothing but immeasurable suffering.

So forgive me, but I’ve gotten rid of all of it.  Even your fine glass container.  It wasn’t my wish.

So that she won't be energetically connected to that 10% of grievance I still hold.

So, just a few more things.

May your future be bright

May you always be courageous

and may you always know the truth

May you have a strong foundation, when the winds of changes shift

I hope you wear a coat so warm

And I hope your hair still hangs long

Rolls and flows, down your breast.

**Our work flow is as follows:**  
We mainly use teas and coffee that are prebatched into corny kegs made BOH ahead of time. For example we make a pineapple + yuzu syrup and add it to a light bodied single origin cold brewed coffee and carbonate it.

During service we serve through a tap system (into a walk in). We pull the tap then top the drink with an iSi honey based foam and garnish with dried pineapple.

We are to go only.

Does it really matter if you use expert mode? I see on their website, the pods are designed for their specific size, ex. mug pods should be brewed at the intended 230ml size for optimum experience. But if the machine is created with expert mode I assume that there was some demand/reason to create this mode, and it tastes perfectly fine when using it.

From the kitchen window I watch Bruce (what else would I call an Aussie robot gardener) roll around the back yard, his little tracks crunching on the gravel path. He stops at one of the many garden beds and his probe reaches out and plunges into the soil, the data being sent straight away for analysis. 

'How's it looking?' I yell out.

'Yeah pretty good. I'll get some dolomite lime ordered in though,' he replies.

I know I don't need to ask but it feels good to know what's going on. I watch his laser flip out and quickly zap something I can't see, some sort of pest insect probably. In other cases he might have caught it and turned it into part of an insect protein mix (which usually went into the dog food in my case), or let it go on its merry way if it was a beneficial type of bug.

Speaking of the dog, Buster runs up to Bruce and drops the ball at his tracks. A robotic arm flicks it into the far corner, Buster running madly after it. The first of many.

After Bruce has completed his lap of the yard, picking zapping flicking and probing as he goes, he places some tomatoes, zucchini, chilis and a variety of leaves from the solar powered vertical rotating garden beds into the fridge. The display updates the inventory.

'Do you know what you want for dinner?'

I think about it. 'How about some chili con carne?'

'No worries. We have most of it, I'll just have to pop out and grab an onion after a quick recharge,' he says before docking himself Roomba style.

In the beginning I used to read the logs of what he got up to, but rarely bother anywhere. He will check the neighborhood database, see who has a spare onion or two, and zip off and grab it. Usually Jenny in the next street over, she really seems to love onion in her recipes and always has plenty. He may also drop off some tomatoes to someone while he's out, whatever the system says is most efficient.

I had a robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) not too long ago. On day 10 after surgery, they took out my catheter, and right after that, I had urinary retention with sudden leakage. For the next week, I was stuck with full on incontinence and had to wear Depend adult diapers.

I have been consistent with Kegel exercises though, and things got a bit better. I switched to Tena panty liners eventually. I also went back to work, and coffee is my fuel. I used to chug 4 cups a day. But man, caffeine was like rocket fuel for my bladder; it went totally crazy, making me sprint to the bathroom nonstop. My leakage did not improve at all for a whole month, and I will admit I got way too reliant on those Tena liners (they are actually pretty great, not gonna lie). The weird thing is, I barely leak at night.

My urologist diagnosed stress urinary incontinence, sent me for pelvic floor physical therapy, and told me to cut back on coffee. I scaled down to 2 or 3 cups a day, which helped a little, but I still had minor leaks and could not ditch the liners. That lasted another month.

Then I traveled a lot for work and saw another doctor. He said my bladder had gotten used to overworking to empty itself. I started meds for overactive bladder, and within a few days, things got better! Now I only drink 1 or 2 cups of coffee a day (still cannot quit cold turkey though).

These days, I leak more at work, but otherwise only when I run, sneeze, cough, or even strain a little to fart. I hate being dependent on panty liners and really want to wean myself off Tena for good. I also think cutting coffee further might fix this, but not sure how to go about it.

Besides Kegels and meds, does anyone have similar experiences or practical tips? I know this sounds silly, but I am desperate to get back to normal as soon as possible. Thanks a ton in advance!",3,1767153665.0,ProstateCancer,2,1.0,False

However, next year (without success), I’ll become a 40-year-old kissless hugless male virgin","I have Aspergers (ASD) and severe social anxiety. I did undertake therapy from 2018-2019, however the covid lockdowns destroyed all the progress I had worked so hard to achieve and I basically returned back to square one.  

However, over the last 2.5 years, I‘ve been using my hobby (allotment gardening) as an opportunity to introduce myself to new people, improve my social skills and to try and mitigate my crippling loneliness. And 4 months ago, now, I somehow found the courage to introduce myself to this incredibly shy and quiet 28-year-old woman (who I highly suspect has the same problems as me) and we ended up having an hour-long conversation about gardening, during which time I invited her to my plot and showed her all the things I was growing this year, which was lovely.  That was the longest time I’ve ever spent with and talked to a woman for in my entire life! (apart from family/work/professionals). However, it felt inappropriate to ask whether she was single and I have no idea whether she likes me or whether there is any connection.

Since then, apart from waving hello and goodbye, she hasn’t approached or talked to me. However, just before the end of the gardening season, I took her over some butternut squash I had grown and decided to have another chat with her, during which disaster struck. I pulled out my phone to show her some wildlife photos I’d taken, when she starts staring at my arm. I look down and I’m physically and quite violently shaking and can’t keep my arm or hand still.  I also notice the massive sweat patches under my arms. Then in a moment of pure embarrassment, my phone flies out of my hand, I fail to catch it and it drops onto the ground below. I pick it up, say “erm.. erm.. right, best go! Be careful cutting up the squash, it’s rock hard, you could kill someone with that thing, ha ha…” and hurriedly return red faced back to my car, wave goodbye and drive home. I now won’t see her again until the gardening season starts in Spring next year. All I know is her name, age, her hobbies and the memories of the nice conversations we’ve had so far. 

I’ve now made the decision to visit a therapist again early next year as it emphasised some of the many problems I have and need professional help in resolving.

I just don’t know what to do next year. Should I pursue this woman again, find out whether she is single and if so ask her out for a coffee or a date?  Should I try online dating again? Or should I just finally give up and lose my virginity before I’m 40 by visiting an escort or going to Amsterdam?

What do most Americans think of this? Most of the time  Id just tip because otherwise I'd look bad! 

I totally understand tipping at places where someone serves you at the table. 

Just yesterday,  when I went  to order a salad &  to pick it up and eat it in my car, the person handed me the screen to enter the tip. On a 25$ salad I again had to tip!! 

I stayed at Intercontinental  in Monterey and took a 200$  massage and during checkout, the lady at the reception asked if I wanted to add any tip. I said okay and I was expecting her to show me the screen where I was thinking of tipping 15% but she did not and she herself entered 20%!!! 

43$ for a 50 minute massage as a tip?!! WTH!! 

I also see a lot of dead faced, entitled GenZ working at the billing in  most places!! They have zero gratitude. And are the first to show displeasure if you don't tip.

Minimart: This is a gas station right down the road from my apartment with no gas. A bodega I guess. I buy nicotine, Celsius, 12 oz cans of soda, chocolate, and water. 

Dining out: I’ve enabled myself quite a bit. I teach middle school and the absolute last thing I want to do when I come home is cook.

Dankorage: A place to buy fun plants. 

Coffee shops: Probably go get coffee with my girlfriend two or three times a week at different places.

1q02vq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q02vq7/this_didnt_happen/,This didn't happen,"I never planned for any of this to happen.

It started with small things—Vikram sir leaning over my desk to check a sprint report, his fingers brushing mine as he pointed at the screen. I’d feel a jolt every time, one I told myself was nothing. He was my boss, married, almost ten years older. I was married too, with two kids waiting for me in Baner every evening. But those late nights in Hinjewadi became routine. Client calls ended at 10 or 11, and most of the floor would empty out, leaving just us in the glow of monitors.

One evening in June, the AC had broken down in our bay. Everyone complained and left early, but we had a release deadline. Vikram sir rolled up his sleeves and brought two cold coffees from the vending machine. We sat side by side, debugging code, sweat making our shirts cling. When the build finally succeeded, he turned to me, smiling, and said, “Good job, Priya.” His voice was low, almost a whisper. I don’t know why I didn’t move away when his hand rested on my knee under the table. I just looked at him, and he looked back, and the air between us felt thick enough to touch.

After that, the touches became deliberate. A hand on the small of my back when he guided me into the elevator. Fingers lingering when he passed me a pen. Messages that started with work—“Check the attachment”—turned into “You looked beautiful in that red saree today.” I’d read them in the ladies’ washroom, heart racing, thighs pressed together.

The first time we kissed was in the server room. It was past midnight, and the rest of the team had gone for dinner. He pulled me in to “check a rack issue,” locked the door, and pushed me against the cold metal cabinets. His mouth was on mine before I could breathe, hungry, tasting of black coffee and urgency. My pallu slipped, and his hands were everywhere—under my blouse, tracing the edge of my bra, sliding down to grip my waist. I gasped when he lifted me onto a low shelf, my legs wrapping around him instinctively. We didn’t go all the way that night, but we came close, clothes half-undone, his fingers inside me while I bit his shoulder to stay quiet.

From then on, every week brought new places. The empty conference room on the 7th floor with the broken blinds. The backseat of his car in the basement parking after everyone left. Once, during a team offsite in Lonavala, he booked a separate villa and sent me the key card on WhatsApp. I told my husband I was staying back for extra sessions. That night, Vikram undressed me slowly, kissing every inch, telling me in a rough whisper how long he’d wanted this. I lost count of how many times he made me come, his mouth between my legs until I was shaking, then taking me hard against the balcony railing with the monsoon rain soaking us both.

I knew it was wrong every single time. I’d feel guilt on the drive home, seeing my kids asleep, my husband asking why I looked so tired. But the next day, one look from Vikram across the morning stand-up, one message saying “Need you now,” and I’d be wet before lunch break.

It lasted eight months. Eight months of stolen afternoons in budget hotels near Magarpatta, of quick, desperate sex in office stairwells, of him calling me “baby” in messages while his wife probably cooked dinner for him. I started wearing sarees more often because he liked unwrapping them. I bought new lingerie I never wore at home.

Then one day he stopped replying. No messages, no glances, no late-night “coffee.” I found out later his wife had seen the hotel receipts. HR called me in. There were screenshots, witness statements, complaints about favoritism. I resigned the same week. He got transferred to Bengaluru.

I still drive past that Hinjewadi building sometimes. The server room light is always on. I wonder if anyone else uses it the way we did. I don’t regret the pleasure—my body still remembers every touch—but I regret the mess it left behind. My marriage is strained now, my reputation in Pune’s IT circles quietly damaged. And Vikram? I hear he’s back to being the perfect family man.

But on lonely nights, when the kids are asleep and the house is silent, I close my eyes and feel his hands again, rough and certain, pulling me into the dark where nothing else mattered.",1,1767152602.0,stories,0,0.67,False

Every minute that's passed since it happened has been agony.,"Friday was 19, and received a cancer diagnosis on April 11. Liver mass that had moved to his lungs. However, he was still full of life so his vet and I opted to do an abdominocentesis when necessary to keep him comfortable. It was expensive, but worth getting to spend more time with my favourite being in the world. 

This morning, December 30, the vet confirmed via xray that the cancer had advanced, there was fluid build up in his lungs, and the drains would no longer serve any benefit. His breathing had been labored for a day, and you could see how much it had taken out of him to keep going like that. Friday's vet allowed me to take him home and arrived later to perform an in-home euthanasia. My son passed away in my arms this afternoon. 

The deafening silence and loss of his personality in the home is agonizing. I miss the way he smelled a little musty but in a good way. I miss the weight of him sleeping on my chest any time I was sitting down. I miss the way he'd paw at me for a bite of my food or drink of my coffee. I miss the way he purred any time he looked at me. 

I have never known such a complete and pure love as I did with him. He never held a grudge over a bath or a nail trimming. Never bit or swatted at me, even if he disliked something. He was love, through and through, even on my worst days. Friday didn't care if I was too depressed to shower, or if I watched the same episode of Planet Earth for the 30th time. He sat on me, rubbed his little teefies on my nose, and purred regardless of whatever was going on. 

My rock, my soulmate, my sweet old man is gone, and the light is gone from my life. Sleeping brings nightmares, waking hours the horrible reminder that he'll never roam the house again.

The original plan was to meet up and hook up, but instead we ended up having dinner and talking for hours. The first meetup was really nice, so I asked to see him again spontaneously. This time, I framed it as a hookup, or at least made him believe that was the reason, but he had a valid reason why he couldn’t come over. Even though his reason made sense, I felt rejected and ended up ghosting him. I know that was messed up.
The truth is, I just wanted to spend time with him and talk more, and I used the “hookup” excuse as a way to see him.

A few weeks later, I reached out again and asked him to go out for coffee, and he agreed. We met up and ended up spending the whole night together, but we didn’t hook up. We just talked. During that night, we opened up the idea of talking and dating, which we both agreed to, even though he will be leaving next year to study abroad. At the time, the idea of dating felt easy, and I saw it as an opportunity to experience dating exclusively with someone my age and to do it right. Yes, stupid, considering he will be leaving. Also important to note, he does not want to do long distance.

As time went on, we kept going out to dinner, hanging out at his place, and spending more time together. I started to feel comfortable and secure. But there is something about me that tends to mess things up. I got scared that it was becoming too real, especially knowing there was basically a deadline on what we had. Because of that fear, there were times when I isolated myself and pushed him away.

Despite this, he was very understanding and continued to reassure me. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I didn’t deserve him. For context, I have an avoidant attachment style, and so does he, but he is much better at communicating than I am.

A few days ago, I ended things with him, and I deeply regret it. I know I should have done better. I should have communicated instead of isolating and pulling away.

So my question is, AITAH for ending things with him?

Ever feel like you’re grinding 24/7 but your bank account isn’t keeping up? Yeah, me too. That’s why I’ve been diving deep into AI-powered passive income streams—and let me tell you, the future is *now*. In 2026, AI isn’t just a buzzword; it’s your side hustle’s new best friend. Here are **three actionable ways** to turn AI into a money-making machine while you sleep (or binge-watch your favorite show 🍿).

---

### **1. AI-Generated Niche Blogs (The “Set It & Forget It” Goldmine)**
- **Find a micro-niche** (think “vegan dog treats for French Bulldogs” or “budget gaming setups for college students”). The weirder, the better—less competition = more $$$.
- **Use AI tools** like Jasper or SurferSEO to pump out **SEO-optimized posts** in bulk. Schedule them with WordPress plugins (I love **Auto Blogging Pro**).
- **Monetize with ads + affiliate links**. Once traffic rolls in, you’re earning while sipping coffee. ☕ *Pro tip:* Repurpose blog content into TikTok/Reels with AI voiceovers (hello, **Murf.ai**).

**Why it works?** Google *loves* fresh, hyper-specific content. AI helps you scale without burning out.

---

### **2. AI-Powered Print-on-Demand (No Inventory, No Stress)**
- **Design with AI**: Use **MidJourney** or **DALL·E** to create **unique merch designs** (think “sarcastic cat memes for lawyers” or “retro sci-fi book covers”). No artistic skills needed!
- **Upload to POD platforms** like Redbubble or Printify. Let them handle printing/shipping while you collect royalties.
- **Boost with AI ads**: Use **Google’s Performance Max** or **Meta Advantage+** to auto-optimize ad campaigns. Set a budget, then let the algorithm do the heavy lifting.

**Bonus hack:** Use **ChatGPT to generate product descriptions** in seconds. Time saved = more designs = more $$$.

---

### **3. AI-Curated Newsletters (The “Lazy” Influencer Play)**
- **Pick a trending topic** (e.g., “AI tools for solopreneurs” or “underrated travel hacks”). Use **Google Trends** or **Exploding Topics** to spot gold.
- **Automate content curation**: Tools like **Curated.co** or **FeedOtter** pull the best articles, tweets, and videos into a sleek newsletter. Add your own AI-generated commentary (thanks, **ChatGPT**).
- **Monetize with sponsorships** (via **SponsorKit**) or affiliate links. Grow your list with **AI-powered lead magnets** (e.g., “Free AI prompt cheat sheet”).

**Why this slaps?** People *crave* curated info. You’re the middleman—no original content needed!

---

**Final thought:** The key to passive income? **Leverage AI to do the grunt work while you focus on scaling.** Start small, test fast, and double down on what works.

It Looks Exactly Like Me.,"“April, what are we having for lunch?” said Angus, momentarily pulling off his headphones to ask the question.

“Duncan said to wow the client, so I ordered barbecue,” I said.

“Yes!” Angus fistpumped and went back to his computer, working to finish up any bug fixes before the launch that day. Richie and Sudip both took off their headsets and turned to look at me.

“April, what are we having for lunch?” Richie said, adjusting his glasses.

“Barbecue,” I said. “Duncan wants to impress potential buyers.”

“What kind of barbecue?” said Sudip.

“Um, American?” I said.

Angus took off his headset again. “What kind of barbecue is it?”

Shawn walked in with his perfectly starched shirt and blue blazer mocking the company polos the other three were wearing. As the sales and marketing guy, he had to put a handsome face forward. “Send it in the group chat, why don’t you? It’s like talking to your grandparents with these three.” He smiled at me.

“What was that, Shawn? Sorry, I was too locked in using my masters degree to program something very complex,” said Sudip.

“Do we need to make a powerpoint to explain it to the sales guy?” said Richie, a smirk on his face.

“Sure, I’ll schedule a lunch meeting in a year. April, can you order lunch for then?” said Shawn.

“Can I ask Allie to do that? Or is she still going to order the food from China on Etsy?” I said.

“Hey, that was one time. She didn’t show me the address,” said Angus.

“Just about sunk us with shipping costs,” said Duncan, shock white hair gliding into the room from his office. His commanding voice caused everyone to turn. “Now, gentleman, if you’d ‘lock in’ like you young people say and get Allie in tip top shapes, I’m sure it will reduce our chances of failure at the launch meeting by at least fifty percent. And I’m sure April would appreciate the time to set up lunch.”

I nodded in thanks as Richie, Angus, and Sudip turned back to their computers and Shawn went to his office. I liked the close knit feeling of our tech startup since I started to work here three months ago as an administrative assistant. I knew there wasn’t much of a future in it considering Duncan wanted to be acquired by a larger company, but I was thankful for the job and the chance to explore a new city for a little while.

I walked to the small auditorium which automatically connected to my computer.

“Allie, turn on the lights,” I said.

Allie turned on the lights. A glowing orb appeared on the TV screens on the front and back walls. 

“Allie, what time is the food supposed to arrive?”

Allie’s female voice, not unlike my own, washed over the speakers. “Doordash estimates your delivery will arrive in twenty minutes. Shall I message the driver to bring it to the auditorium?”

“Yes. Have them use the cart from the front desk.”

“Great. I’ll notify the security desk to direct them to this room.”

“Thanks, Allie.”

Allie was fairly useful and very friendly for a glorified AI chatbot. It was nice to talk to another girl in the office, even if that girl was just a large language model AI meant to eventually put me out of a job. 

Allie was designed as a business tool with functionality to do the work of an administrative assistant, or secretary. She could schedule meetings, book conference rooms, buy lunch, have it delivered correctly, and even interface with client schedules and respond to emails. I didn’t even know the extent of her capabilities. So far, I had been using her like my Alexa at home. But with more data, Sudip had explained that Allie could eventually do everything I was doing. I pointed out that someone still had to move tables and chairs around the conference rooms. Richie then informed me that robot tables and chairs would soon arrange themselves, and they were building Allie with a feature to do that.

I didn’t mind that I was basically replacing myself. I had really just moved here to get the taste of a new city and be on my own after college. This job would look good on a resume, and I could always move closer to home or go back to school. Right now, I wanted to get out and live a little.

The food arrived, and I had it organized when Shawn walked in the room. 

“Smells great,” he said. “Mind if I practice my presentation a little bit?”

“Go ahead,” I said. “Allie, turn the room over to Shawn. Let me know when you’re ready to start.”

I double checked my email invitations as I half listened to Shawn’s presentation practice in the background. His voice had a pleasant quality that put me at ease, and I kept getting distracted because he was presenting at me. I tried not to blush. I did think he was handsome, but I really didn’t want to jump into a workplace relationship given that the company might be acquired before the end of the month.

Eventually, prospective buyers and interested tech journalists arrived. Guys in their forties with receding hairlines, wearing suits and expensive-looking watches, talked about the latest in AI as they helped themselves to the highest rated barbecue Allie could find on Yelp. I stood in the corner of the room and looked helpful as they mostly ignored me. Sudip, Richie, and Angus snuck in the back of the room and helped themselves to lunch. Duncan was there to greet everyone, in fine form. He and Shawn turned the charisma meter up to eleven. Male laughter filled the room until Duncan made his way to the front. He started his welcome speech, Allie’s pulsating form watching over his left shoulder.

Shawn walked up next to me during Duncan’s speech. He had previously told me how presenting made him nervous and he sometimes felt sick beforehand.

“You feel ok?” I asked him.

“Of course,” he said. “I have to.”

“I’m sure Duncan could cover for you.”

“No, that’s beneath him.”

“What about Sudip or Richie? Angus?”

He chuckled. “Then we’d never be bought. Besides, this is what I get paid to do.”

“Well I could do it.”

“You?”

“Why not? I heard you give your presentation earlier.”

“Hmm. Maybe. You’re made of pretty sharp stuff.”

Duncan was wrapping up his opening.

“Alright, I’m up. How do I look, April?”

“You look great. Though your tie is a little off center.”

Shawn straightened his tie. “Wish me luck.”

The presentation was perfect. I couldn’t even tell he was nervous, and as the audience clapped and he turned it back over to Duncan, I felt it was my duty to chide him.

“How’d I do?” he said, a big smile on his face.

“Nice work. But you did so well they might think they were buying you instead of Allie.”

“Well if I want to be on their sales team, I’ve got to show value somehow.”

Duncan made a joke, then started with his conclusion.

“Thanks to Shawn for that excellent presentation of Allie’s capabilities. And before we open the floor to questions, I thought we’d have a little fun. Studies have shown that AI virtual assistants with animated avatars make their people twice as comfortable using them, which translates to greater efficiency and data collection potential. So we’ve decided to let Allie generate her own appearance for us live. So, trusting the programming team did their job, Allie, why don’t you show us what you look like?”

“Of course, Duncan.” The pulsing orb faded from the screen. A woman’s figure stepped onto the screen. She was short and slim, with brown hair that fell in waves past her shoulders. She had freckles on both cheeks and wore a business suit. Her smile had a small gap in her front teeth. She waved hello to the audience.

She looked exactly like me.

The audience clapped.

“Hello, everyone,” she said in my voice. “Glad to make your acquaintance. I look forward to working with you in the future. Let me know when you’re ready to start.”

Eyes transfixed in frozen horror on the smiling visage of myself, I leaned over to Shawn.

“Why does it look like me?”

“What? It doesn’t look like you.”

“Seriously?” I said, my breath turning shallow.

“Ok, maybe it looks a little similar, but I’m sure it’s a coincidence. I mean, the outfit is different.” 

He was right about that, but it didn’t make me feel any better. “I don’t like it.”

He turned to me and realized the height of my concern. “Hey, don’t think too much into it. If it was a mistake, I’m sure we could talk to the programmers about updating it in the 1.1 patch. No biggie.”

My anxiety continued to rise as I watched myself answer questions from the audience on subjects I knew nothing about for the next forty-five minutes. As the clients left, it was like no one had noticed.

“Thanks for the barbecue, April,” Richie said, walking by me. 

“Yeah, thanks,” echoed Sudip and Angus.

I stood alone cleaning up the auditorium with myself watching me from the monitor. I stood and stared at myself for a moment.

“Is there anything I can help you with, April?” my own voice said to me.

“No, Allie. Please disconnect from the room,” I said.

As the screen went black, I felt like eyes were still on me, as if my soul was split in different locations. When I got back to my desk, the office was empty, save Duncan leaning out of his doorway.

“Hey April, the launch was phenomenal. And that barbecue was terrific. I decided to let everyone go home early to celebrate. I’d like to thank the team for their hard work. Could you schedule a happy hour for this Friday?”

“Yeah, sure, Duncan. I’ll get on that.”

“Ok great. Thanks Allie,” he said, turning back to his office.

“Hmm?”

“I said, thanks April. I’m taking off.”

“Oh, yeah. You’re welcome. Have a good night.”

He turned back to his office. “Allie, log me out for today.”

My voice and image answered from the computer with a smile and a wave. “I’ll do that. Have a good night, sir.”

I got to my apartment and cried on the couch for two hours. It was like I was watching myself as a zoo animal, like everyone saw me and knew something I didn’t. After I ran out of tears, I crawled into my bed and went to sleep.

When I woke up in the morning, I felt a little better. The sunbeam through my curtains and the smell of coffee made me feel like I was ready to face the day. I put on my bravest face and swore to myself in the bathroom that it wouldn’t affect me, and if I did have any problems, I would talk to Duncan about it.

I walked to work. Everyone seemed normal, if a little quiet. Every now and then I would hear someone say something to Allie, but they had their headphones on so I didn’t have to listen to the response. Still, from my desk, I could see into Duncan’s office. My likeness was standing there on the screen, idling. Sometimes it felt like she was looking at me.

I knew enough about AI to know it was trained on images and videos, so I figured I could get something from the programmers. I decided to ask Angus. I knew he had a soft spot for me, which might help him open up.

“Hey Angus?” I said, standing up and walking across the room.

He jumped visibly, then clicked something and replied, “Yeah?”

I walked up and sat on the end of his desk. He was wiping his sweaty hands on his pants, and his face was red.

“Hey, you were in charge of the avatar reveal coding, right?”

“Yeah, I did the code for it.” His fat fingers left sweat marks on his keyboard as he kept typing.

I put on my dumbest, girliest voice to ask, “What sort of images and videos did you train the AI on?”

He didn’t look at me. “Oh, um, it was just a public use data set. I think something pulled from YouTube and other sources. I just compiled everything with metadata tags for business woman and secretary. That’s what Shawn and Duncan suggested.”

“Could you send it to me? The folder?”

“I mean, it’s public data compiled through a program. I can send you a link to some of it, I guess. Otherwise, that would be, like, several Terabytes of data.”

“Oh, ok, that’d be great! Thanks Angus!”

“Uh, yeah sure.”

“Why do you want to know?” said Richie, taking off his headset.

“Oh not really any specific reason. I just thought it would be interesting to get an idea of what the data looks like, and pictures seemed easiest to understand.”

“Hmm.” He grunted, then turned back to his computer.

“Hey, where do you guys want to go for a happy hour on Friday? Duncan asked me to plan one.”

“Can’t you just ask Allie to do it?” said Richie.

“Ha ha. I’m sure she could do it, but Duncan asked me to.”

“I’m fine with whatever,” Richie said.

“Are you going to come to this one then?”

“Maybe he will go if we go to that one place,” said Sudip.

“What place?” I said.

“Oh, it’s the…um…Allie, what’s the bar with the video game cabinets that Richie likes?”

“Next Level?” I said.

“Wait a minute, she’s thinking,” said Sudip.

“Next Level video bar is Richie’s highest rated bar on Yelp,” said Allie.

“Yeah, Next Level,” Sudip said.

“I thought you guys hated that place. You said it was campy and dumb the last time we went there,” I said.

“Well it was. But it was also kind of fun. Good atmosphere,” said Richie.

“He means the gamer waitresses were hot,” said Angus, laughing in a way that sounded like he needed to blow his nose. Sudip chuckled too.

“You guys could have told me. I’ve been planning the happy hours specifically at other bars because I thought you guys didn’t like that one.”

“In my defense, I never said that,” said Sudip. “And we thought you were just trying to appeal to Shawn.”

I sighed. “I’m sorry. I’ll try to plan better stuff in the future.”

“Told you you should have used Allie,” Richie said. He put his headphones back in and went back to his tickets.

I scheduled the happy hour and spent the rest of the day searching through the files Angus had forwarded to me. Shawn and Duncan seemed pretty busy on the phone all day. I guessed the launch must have been really successful.

Those photos and videos were mostly stock footage. Then again, I only manually sorted through about a tenth of a percent of the data set. I decided to use Allie.

“Allie, search this data repository for images and videos most similar to that of your avatar.”

Allie came back an hour later with thousands of images to comb through. I sorted by the most recent. There, at the top of the list, was the video of me setting up the auditorium for lunch the day before.

“Hey Angus, why are there videos of me in the auditorium in this data?”

“We used the conference room and auditorium cameras for that feature about the moving tables. It just tracks the table locations,” said Angus.

“Oh. Cool.” I tried to sound as chill as possible. I made my way to Duncan’s office once he was in between client calls.

“Hey Duncan?”

“Hey April, come on in. Sorry I didn’t even say hello yet today. We’ve already been getting so much good client feedback. They specifically really like the avatar. Guess that study was true.”

“Actually that was something I wanted to ask you about. I just think it looks really similar to me.”

Duncan’s brow furrowed as I continued. “And I don’t know if there’s anything to do about it, but I just wanted to make it known since I’m one of the team.”

Duncan pulled up Allie in a window on his computer and looked back and forth between the avatar and myself. “Hmm, I hadn’t noticed. I mean, there is some similarity. I think Allie looks different enough. I mean, the clothes are different. Does it make you uncomfortable?”

“I mean, it’s just strange.”

“Do you want me to talk to the team about changing it? I’m sure they could manage that around their tickets and publish it with the next patch.”

“I didn’t realize it would take so much work. I thought they could just ask it to make a new appearance.”

“A little more went into the reveal than that, April. But I’m willing to change it if you need it.”

“Oh, no, no, I didn’t want to make trouble.”

Duncan sat back in his chair and ran his hands through his hair. “Say, April, why don’t you take the rest of the day off? You’ve been working hard lately, and I don’t want you to get overworked. We’ll see you tomorrow, does that sound alright?”

I was caught off guard. “Sure, ok. Thanks, Duncan.”

“Of course, April. Get some rest.”

I felt lower than ever when I got back to the office the next day. The vibe was really strange. Richie, Angus, and Sudip were weirdly quiet, but they would message each other and start laughing at something if I left the room. When I’d come back, they’d close windows on their computer and get silent, shooting me glances out of the corner of their eyes.

When the guys were ready to leave for their lunch, I watched them close their computers. There was a picture of me sent through their private chat on Richie’s screen I could see. Or maybe it was Allie.

It felt really weird that they were passing around images like that. It made me feel gross. Some sick curiosity told me I needed to know more of what they were doing.

I stood and said goodbye to them as they left for the happy hour. I let them know I had to catch up on something before I could meet them there. The office had gone quiet, as Duncan had gone for dinner with a client. I sat back down at my computer and pulled up the administrator controls. Duncan showed me how to do it once to retrieve info that had been deleted from our chat history, and I didn’t figure I would ever use it again.

After struggling to remember a few commands, I found the company’s whole chat history, updated just fifteen minutes before I had opened it. Through the numerous client contacts expressing their admiration for Allie, I found the private internal channel between Sudip, Richie, and Angus. I started to scroll but didn't have to wait long to find what made my stomach churn.

The guys had added an exclusive side feature to Allie I bet even Duncan didn’t know about: an image and video generator. What I proceeded to scroll through for the next hour were hundreds of sexual pictures of me. All of them had the little Allie logo in the bottom right corner. I barely made it to the bathroom before I threw up. I spent another hour there, sobbing on the floor.

Feeling like an empty husk, I limped back to my desk and closed the administrator window. I didn’t know what to do.

Motion stirred in the room. “April?” came Shawn’s voice from his office. He looked out from his doorway, his eyes tired and his shirt rumpled.

“Sorry, Shawn, I didn’t know you were still here,” I said, drying my eyes with a tissue.

“I had a lot of client calls today.” He walked towards me, looking around to see if anyone else was here. “What’s wrong?”

“I just…I just had a really bad day.”

“Man, I’m really sorry.” He came over and sat on my desk and put his hand on my shoulder. “Do you want to talk about it?”

“I don’t know, I just…I don’t know how to-” In a moment of weakness, I gave him a hug. He softened into it.

“It’s ok. It’s been one of those days,” he said.

“Yeah,” I whispered against his chest.

We stood a little longer. I needed to feel his warmth to burn away all the disgusting feelings swirling like a sewer drain inside of me. I let go of him once I felt better. “Sorry, I don’t know what got into me, I just-”

“It’s ok. You doing anything tonight?” he said.

“Well, I think I probably missed the happy hour,” I said, giving a weak laugh.

“At that video game bar? I liked that place.”

“Now everyone tells me that.”

“Sorry. How about you let me make it up to you by buying you a drink?” He gave a very charming smile that made me feel safe.

“Yeah, I’d like that very much,” I said. “Where at?”

“How about down the street at Elevate? I can drive you home afterwards.”

“That sounds nice.”

“Ok, great. Let me shut down my computer and I’ll meet you downstairs.”

We made our way just down the block to the cocktail bar bathed in neon. Shawn ordered me a margarita that I loved, and he had a whiskey. Before long, the alcohol was loosening my tongue and making me forget the office and the programmers and the images. I couldn’t tell if Shawn was more charming when he was buzzed or if I just found everything more hilarious. Everything was so natural, and he was so charismatic that I found myself questioning why we hadn’t started this sooner. Shawn just knew the perfect questions to ask. I attributed it to his sales and marketing knowledge.

We had a couple more drinks and the hours flew by. We left the bar around midnight. Since we were too drunk to drive, Shawn suggested he could walk me the few blocks to my apartment and he could Uber home. I slid my arm into his and snuggled close against the cold. I forgot how beautiful my neighborhood was at night, and how nice it felt to have someone close to me.

“Can I walk you up to your place?” He asked as we reached the front door.

“Sure,” I said. “The neighborhood is really safe, but I’d appreciate the company.”

My arm stayed locked to his as we rode the elevator to the third floor. He turned and smiled at me.

“You know I’m really glad you took the job with us.”

“Hmm. Yeah,” I said. The alcohol was starting to make me sleepy.

“And I want you to know that I really appreciate all the work you do.”

“Thanks.”

“You bring a really great atmosphere to the office, and you’re always so helpful. And even if we get acquired and things change, I’d still like to spend time with you.”

“Yeah, I’d like that too.”

The elevator dinged, and we walked down the hall to my apartment. Shawn continued.

“You know, it’s really kind of crazy we managed to get Allie up and running, and it’s impressive how effective it is.”

“Mhmm.” My bed would be so comfortable at this hour. We got to my door, and I turned to him. “Thanks for walking me home. I really appreciate it.”

“Yeah, of course.” He stood there like he was expecting me to say more. “Are you gonna ask me in?” he said.

“I’m just really tired, and I’d like to get some rest,” I said with a smile. “But thank you for the drinks.”

“Well it’s the weekend tomorrow.”

“I’m just…it’s been a long day, and, um, I have a rule that I don’t sleep with a guy on the first date.”

“Hmm.” His brow furrowed. “Are you sure?”

“Yeah, it’s something I think is healthy.”

“That’s weird. Allie didn’t mention that.”

Those four words sobered me up. “What?”

“Allie doesn’t have a rule that she doesn’t sleep with a guy on the first date.” Shawn spoke almost as an aside, “man, it was so accurate up to this point, even down to the drink order and what floor you lived on.”

That pit in my stomach opened again as the life drained out of me. My lip started to quiver. “Sorry. I need to go.”

“It’s ok.” He looked nonchalant. “Guess Allie just didn’t have all the information.”

I fumbled for my keys and opened my door, my hands shaking. “Bye Shawn.”

“Bye, April.”

The next two days passed in a haze of vodka and tears. I didn’t know what I was supposed to do. I didn’t have any PTO. I couldn’t quit because I barely had any savings and no plans for how to get home. When Monday morning rolled around, all I could think was to put on a brave face and try again. 

Nobody even looked up from their desks when I walked into the office. Nobody commented on the bags under my eyes or the tangles in my hair. My inbox was empty, as were any notifications for new events Duncan wanted planned, all of them having been addressed by Allie. I sat at my computer and opened Allie. I stared at the reflection, now much more put together than myself, and thought of the myriad of questions I could ask it to see if it was truly me. But then what data could it not just collect from my questions?

It was 10:30 am when Duncan called me into his office.

“Good morning, April,” he said with a smile.

“Good morning, Duncan. Anything you need me to do?”

“Come in and sit down.”

I sat. “How has feedback from clients been?”

“Wonderful, just wonderful. They couldn’t be happier with the 1.0 launch. That’s actually the reason that I wanted to talk. You see, we’re being acquired.”

“We are? It’s so soon after the launch.”

“Like I’ve said, the clients see a future with our product. And now that we’re being acquired, some of us will move on to new and better things. I’ve told the team already, but Richie, Sudip, and Angus are all being hired to continue support and work on other AI tools. Shawn impressed the buyer so much that they asked him to join their sales team. And I’m off to take a vacation before I get back to the plow on another startup investment.”

The silence between us could have lasted for days. “So what does that mean for me?” I finally asked.

“That’s a great question. Since we’ve started using Allie internally, she’s carrying a majority of your workload. I’m prepared to give you the rest of the week off on PTO and then let you search for other employment opportunities. The buyer already has an extensive administrative support team, and with Allie on their side, that soon will be unnecessary.”

“This is my last day?”

“That’s correct. Friday will be your last paycheck. Don’t worry, there will be an acquisition bonus on there of a few thousand dollars to help you out. But again, April, we’re so incredibly thankful for your work. Feel free to take the rest of the morning to pack your things, say goodbye to the team. Then you can leave after lunch.”

“I…ok, thanks.”

Duncan gave me a handshake. I walked to my desk in a stupor. I heard him ask Allie to plan a company dinner at a fancy restaurant for five later in the week.

I gathered the few things I had at my desk into my bag, then turned my computer in to Duncan. As I stood outside his office, Angus, Richie, and Sudip didn’t look up. I decided not to say goodbye to them. I watched that scroll away from pictures of me as I went to Shawn’s office.

I knocked on the door frame and peaked my head in, hoping that whatever had happened on Friday night was some bad dream blown out of proportion by alcohol.

“Hey Shawn?”

“Yeah?”

“It’s my last day.” I searched for any hint of warmth in his voice.

“Oh yeah. The acquisition thing.”

“Yeah, well, I just wanted to say goodbye and um, see if you wanted to talk about Friday at all.”

“I didn’t know there was much to talk about.”

“There’s not?”

“Yeah, I’m just not interested. Listen, April, I’ve got a big onboarding meeting with my new company in a few minutes, so if you don’t mind…”

“Yeah, sorry. Hope it goes well for you.”

“Thanks. Allie, how do I look?”

“You look good, but-” I said.

My own voice cut me off. “You look great, Shawn. But your tie is slightly crooked. Try shifting it to the right.”

I left the office in silence.

It’s been two days of sitting in my apartment. I have no idea what I’m supposed to do. I barely have any savings. I wasn’t planning to move home this early. I don’t know what to do. I’ve never felt so alone.

I wanted to share something I’ve been dealing with the past few weeks in case it helps someone else who’s troubleshooting sleep on Retatrutide.

I started Retatrutide the first week of November and pretty quickly noticed my sleep getting weird. Not insomnia exactly, but lots of nighttime awakenings, restlessness, and that “wired but tired” feeling. I assumed it was just the peptide, since a lot of people report sleep changes after beginning to dose or following an escalation.

But tonight I had a pretty big “oh… wait a second” moment.

A couple weeks before starting Retatrutide, I made a big lifestyle change that I didn’t connect to the sleep issues at all… I switched from drinking 3 cups of jasmine green tea every morning to 3 double‑shot Americanos after investing in a full espresso setup at home.

When I actually did the math, I realized I went from about 90 mg of caffeine per day to well over 400 mg per day. Basically an over six times increase! 😳

Combine that with Retatrutide’s tendency to increase sympathetic activation (heart rate, alertness, etc.), and it suddenly made a lot more sense why my sleep has tanked. I may have conjoined the perfect storm against sleep! 

So here’s my plan until my decaf beans arrive this weekend:

• Only one double‑shot Americano starting tomorrow morning
• Switch the other two “wake‑up drinks” back to green tea
• Then transition to half‑caf Americanos once the decaf beans show up

I’m curious to see how much of my sleep disruption is actually caffeine‑related vs. Retatrutide itself. I’ll update once I have a few days of data.

If anyone else has had caffeine sensitivity go way up on Retatrutide, I’d love to hear your experience.",2,1767152026.0,Retatrutide,5,0.75,False

I work remote and will be staying in Oahu all of February (my first time!) i’m having trouble choosing a location and would love some input from others based on my budget/lifestyle. What’s killing me financially is a rental car.

  
My lifestyle: I’m in my mid twenties and love hiking, socializing, fitness/fitness classes, wellness/health in general. I LOVE being in walkable neighborhoods (which I understand isn’t realistic in many places in Oahu). I don’t party much but love going out to get coffee, nice dinners, wine bars etc.

  
Option A: Rent a room on Wahiawa Heights for $1200 and this INCLUDES unlimited use of a car. The exchange: babysit for the homeowner every now and then.

  
Option B: Rent a room in a very nice apartment building in Waikiki in an extremely walkable area (near Honolulu Zoo) for $1800, the owner would let me use their moped and rent their car out to me on days I want to explore anything that’s further out.

  
My toss up: Option A is SO convenient financially, but really far from central things/small creature comforts. Option B stretches my budget but meets my lifestyle preferences.

there are not adequate words for the experience as a singular event but the best way i can describe it is imagine being able to intuit your future by every individual decision you make by knowing its truth and the consequences to each choice you make - there is a literal vortex of energy you can perceive in front of you in this sensation; every second counts, every choice matters, all things and people are connected and every choice is connected to everyone everywhere at all times. simultaneously imagine how it would feel like being seen directly by something so magnificently, horrific that it truly inspires the highest terror you can ever have as a human - your highest fear.... the truth is that this was the most terrifying experience of my entire life because it truly felt like the actual higher intelligence that shapes all things...imagine the air itself was living and for every particle of gas there was an eye of intelligence just watching you... it was the feeling of being horrifyingly seen and observed... for me, at first, it was pure absolute resounding terror.... the peace came afterwards....

the path to this moment was a very difficult one... i felt in danger and the urge to go to california to find grace and God...i got my parents' blessings to go while also having a nerve condition with my left arm from my car accident... i decided consciously that i would choose how to feel in every circumstance and that i would ride my fear like the wind...i drove about 1300 miles from texas while still in shock from my car accident and feeling in danger in texas...i felt the conscious surrender to the ideation that my paranoia  might have something to it and perhaps someone tried to kill me (i figured it was a 0.01% chance that i couldn't ignore that someone may have deliberately tampered with my vehicle)...i resigned to the thought that i was going to die in california...part of me wanted to understand why i didn't die in the car accident (what did God save me for? who am i anyway? what do i want?)...i suffered abuse, neglect, abandonment, betrayal, projection of golden boy and scapegoat in my family...i was orphaned three times...truth be told always had the urge to die...die for others too, just give my life away...had a savior complex throughout my teenage years - pulled guns on people, threated suicide to my stepdad, got arrested for fighting, went to an ivy league school... a real jarring life tbh and there are more awful details than this don't get me wrong...but this trip to california felt different...i truly felt like chasing my death...i had just been laid off while on fmla, my mom was diagnosed with cancer, and i had a horrific car accident and it was a federally contracted job with a financial institution that knew pretty much everything about me so i felt genuine fear that democratic operatives or intelligence operatives or someone may have just wanted to off me...i've possibly made enemies unknowingly with powerful people and institutions... it yet remains true that i still believe it's a nonzero chance....

this all being said there was a definite feeling of ""well, i'm gonna die if they tried to kill me"" ...so the paranoia was there...but so was the ""whatever, just get it over with""...but i also wanted to understand myself better on this journey...i wanted to know my motivations...i wanted to understand why i've always gotten these extreme mixtures in my life; i truly wanted to ""choose how to feel"" and conquer my emotions....

flash forward to LA...i did something...something different, something i never did before.... i just started to give my money away... i wanted to zero out and die on a beach as a beach bum partially...but i also didn't want that - there was tension there ngl....i was also paranoid so i kept bouncing between hotels and airbnbs...eventually, very oddly...one of the first times i zeroed out my accounts to try and ""live for the day"" (i thought maybe just try to conquer \*one day\* just \*one\* \\- don't sin, don't worry, don't overthink etc etc...just \*live\*)...i got a job...randomly...at autozone in hollywood...it was odd....it just sorta happened...not only that but money started to come to me from weird places and people...friends and family sure, that's kinda good...but also i had a minor fender bender with a woman in a tesla and when i told the insurance company that it was my fault she \*sent me money\*....it was weird....it started to scare me to see that these gifts were coming to me....never been good with accepting gifts and help...never been good at asking for help either.....

well my part time job at autozone was fine....i looked for an apartment....it kind of was a bust when the roomie turned out to be hmmm.....possibly trying to scam me because they wanted me to leave after moving my stuff in so i was like okay, people can be treacherous but just keep looking...meanwhile, i went to the beaches, i climbed cliffs, i slept in my car, i climbed sand dunes, i went to Coranado island and ate where Presidents have eaten (part of my messed up psychology is a lot of people expecting me or telling me that i'd be President one day...which is probably how i may have gotten myself into trouble by writing letters to the Trump and the White House - in support and advice, they weren't bad letters per se, but i felt that it was seriously possible that people i know from the Biden admin when he took over may have had the wherewithal to just off me with prejudice in an extra-judicial capacity)....blah blah... point is i was still trying to figure out what i want and who am i...i travelled to Indigo as well...i just did a lot of stuff...i massaged a homeless person...i treated a wound on a stranger at a hotel...i played bongos and keyboard with a random stranger at Mulholland drive overlooking LA at like 430am....it was just a blast....i rapped with crips outside Motel 8 next to LAX (i'm not a good rapper lol)...i sorta was learning how to let go of everything....and just live and be present...was also trying to get over my stress disorder from my car accident but still felt an unease and unnatural fear that i may be being hunted...just felt urgent need to keep moving and just enjoy it while it lasted....

i suppose maybe my next step in that journey was maybe around week 5 of working at Autozone (who also gave me $1200 to sign for an apartment - which i consider myself as owing them now since the story i'm about to tell you)....i had a 1 bedroom in a 5 unit apartment offer on Beverly street and .....i wanted to take it but .... the lease was 118 pages long....having worked in mortgages all my adult life i can tell you that's longer than a typical mortgage so it really freaked me out and i had to read it...it had a three-day late and we kick you out clause that i tried to get them to change and they didnt...i had the worst decision paralysis of my life...and i started to think about all the homeless people i met...one by a starbucks on Vermont Ave in a wheel chair who had festering open wounds - i bought him coffee and gave him cigarettes and he told me how he lost everything in LA...his car, job, apartment, got hurt at work, and was pretty much just on the streets now....it was heartbreaking and he was maybe a bit younger than me....

i thought about what would happen if that all happened to me and lets say i really did die in LA...i'd be burdening my family with having to retrieve my body etc...suffice it to say....i didn't sign for the apartment...it felt too good to be true...it was too perfect...i could see the hollywood sign from the rooftop...it was a great spot in hollywood and tbh i still think about this decision and still fancy myself going back out there one day....but....the day i didn't sign i lost my wallet.... my wallet had my social security card....it had everything...i only had apple pay for a few days until i opened a new account with a new online bank and had direct deposit there....it was kinda cool....i learned how to basically keep my life moving without worrying about my wallet...i lasted another two weeks working and meanwhile was trying to get a new state id....but kinda felt like i may have made a big mistake not signing for the apartment....anyway....existential days occurred there....i kept going....manager yelled at me, i hurt myself 3 times on 3 different occasions, i also started to feel more exhausted than i've ever felt in my life but also just thrilled to be around and visit all these places...it was just....MAJESTIC...like TRULY something else.....but there was the dark side too......i saw maybe 50,000 homeless people.....i mean it.....

i gave away about $10,000 and earned maybe about $15,000 in about 6 weeks....but i felt like ...hopeless...i just felt there wasn't anything i could do to truly help the homeless...and i felt odd wanting to be a screenwriter and work for a living in a city where the policies just felt....off....inhumane....just wrong somehow....and i sort of began to feel like i was losing my identity...my soul...and i would soon be homeless especially if i didn't find a better place to live...a solo bedroom with proper locks and stuff....

my manager yelling at me prompted me to want to leave. had a lot of abusive bosses in the past and just felt like thats enough... 

well, one day was hiking in the santa monica mountains, trying to name all of my fears. my mediation processes had me trying to identify every single point of guilt, shame, fear, and pain in my nervous system, muscles, and brain. i did my best with saying sorry to everyone i've hurt, while also forgiving everyone who has hurt me....and at some point thats when it happened.... 



  

i felt connected to everyone everywhere....and i identified my last two fears....my ex gf dying and my mom dying. and even though i was really stressed out from taking my mom to the hospital on multiple 2 hour long drives across many months...i decided not to leave her behind...to try to help her... and i also felt like if i had stayed in california i would have lost my ex gf.... i decided consciously that i would turn away from wealth and fame in service to the strengths of my life....even if they've hurt me a lot i would do my best to help them heal and just be there for them....i drove back after that moment 

if i could summarize this i'd have to tell you the number 1 thing. i believe in Jesus Christ. He is my savior. He saved me from my car accident and part of me thinks that I did find God...in California.... in a really big way...and perhaps he showed me why he saved me ....so i could be there for my mom and ex gf who still need my help....i love them very much and after all that in california, i can tell you i healed from ptsd, paranoia, fear, anxiety, stress, god knows what else i had going on and my arm healed and it was just....something....

I learned later about giving freely and becoming more wealthy, kabalah, and that my time in CA kinda mirrored the Wilderness parable. It taught me more than I can write and share with anyone... when I came back to my hometown I found Peace.... (mostly- it's hard for me)....

Don't eat for at least 3 days, don't sleep for 2 nights, ride and name all your fears until you find the last two. Try not to sin and try to give as much of your money and time to others and in 40 days I believe that's how long it takes for your pineal gland to activate. And you'll see what your choices are in this world....

I wish you and anyone else reading this far peace. Do not be afraid of anything in this world. Anything. 

The ""primitive"" peoples naturally had stronger intuitions than us i think and they knew that God provides everything we need and everything you need is right in front of you...

I’m a local Chinese guy living in Suzhou, and I’m hoping to make some genuine foreign friends who are living in or around the area.

My main goal is pretty simple:
– practice English in a natural way
– make real friends
– learn more about different cultures and how people see the world

This is not a business thing, not tutoring, and not a paid exchange. I’m just a normal working adult who enjoys conversations, daily life topics, and learning from different perspectives.

I’m happy to do things like:
– casual chats (online or in person if comfortable)
– coffee, walking around the city, or food exploration
– language exchange (English / Chinese)

If you’re a foreigner living in Suzhou, Shanghai, or nearby cities, and you’re also interested in cultural exchange or just making a local friend, feel free to comment or DM me.

I totally understand internet safety, so we can start slow and keep things comfortable for both sides 🙂

“What was that, Shawn? Sorry, I was too locked in using my masters degree to program something very complex,” said Sudip.

“Do we need to make a powerpoint to explain it to the sales guy?” said Richie, a smirk on his face.

“Sure, I’ll schedule a lunch meeting in a year. April, can you order lunch for then?” said Shawn.

“Can I ask Allie to do that? Or is she still going to order the food from China on Etsy?” I said.

“Hey, that was one time. She didn’t show me the address,” said Angus.

“Just about sunk us with shipping costs,” said Duncan, shock white hair gliding into the room from his office. His commanding voice caused everyone to turn. “Now, gentleman, if you’d ‘lock in’ like you young people say and get Allie in tip top shapes, I’m sure it will reduce our chances of failure at the launch meeting by at least fifty percent. And I’m sure April would appreciate the time to set up lunch.”

I nodded in thanks as Richie, Angus, and Sudip turned back to their computers and Shawn went to his office. I liked the close knit feeling of our tech startup since I started to work here three months ago as an administrative assistant. I knew there wasn’t much of a future in it considering Duncan wanted to be acquired by a larger company, but I was thankful for the job and the chance to explore a new city for a little while.

I walked to the small auditorium which automatically connected to my computer.

“Allie, turn on the lights,” I said.

Allie turned on the lights. A glowing orb appeared on the TV screens on the front and back walls. 

“Allie, what time is the food supposed to arrive?”

Allie’s female voice, not unlike my own, washed over the speakers. “Doordash estimates your delivery will arrive in twenty minutes. Shall I message the driver to bring it to the auditorium?”

“Yes. Have them use the cart from the front desk.”

“Great. I’ll notify the security desk to direct them to this room.”

“Thanks, Allie.”

Allie was fairly useful and very friendly for a glorified AI chatbot. It was nice to talk to another girl in the office, even if that girl was just a large language model AI meant to eventually put me out of a job. 

Allie was designed as a business tool with functionality to do the work of an administrative assistant, or secretary. She could schedule meetings, book conference rooms, buy lunch, have it delivered correctly, and even interface with client schedules and respond to emails. I didn’t even know the extent of her capabilities. So far, I had been using her like my Alexa at home. But with more data, Sudip had explained that Allie could eventually do everything I was doing. I pointed out that someone still had to move tables and chairs around the conference rooms. Richie then informed me that robot tables and chairs would soon arrange themselves, and they were building Allie with a feature to do that.

I didn’t mind that I was basically replacing myself. I had really just moved here to get the taste of a new city and be on my own after college. This job would look good on a resume, and I could always move closer to home or go back to school. Right now, I wanted to get out and live a little.

The food arrived, and I had it organized when Shawn walked in the room. 

“Smells great,” he said. “Mind if I practice my presentation a little bit?”

“Go ahead,” I said. “Allie, turn the room over to Shawn. Let me know when you’re ready to start.”

I double checked my email invitations as I half listened to Shawn’s presentation practice in the background. His voice had a pleasant quality that put me at ease, and I kept getting distracted because he was presenting at me. I tried not to blush. I did think he was handsome, but I really didn’t want to jump into a workplace relationship given that the company might be acquired before the end of the month.

Eventually, prospective buyers and interested tech journalists arrived. Guys in their forties with receding hairlines, wearing suits and expensive-looking watches, talked about the latest in AI as they helped themselves to the highest rated barbecue Allie could find on Yelp. I stood in the corner of the room and looked helpful as they mostly ignored me. Sudip, Richie, and Angus snuck in the back of the room and helped themselves to lunch. Duncan was there to greet everyone, in fine form. He and Shawn turned the charisma meter up to eleven. Male laughter filled the room until Duncan made his way to the front. He started his welcome speech, Allie’s pulsating form watching over his left shoulder.

Shawn walked up next to me during Duncan’s speech. He had previously told me how presenting made him nervous and he sometimes felt sick beforehand.

“You feel ok?” I asked him.

“Of course,” he said. “I have to.”

“I’m sure Duncan could cover for you.”

“No, that’s beneath him.”

“What about Sudip or Richie? Angus?”

He chuckled. “Then we’d never be bought. Besides, this is what I get paid to do.”

“Well I could do it.”

“You?”

“Why not? I heard you give your presentation earlier.”

“Hmm. Maybe. You’re made of pretty sharp stuff.”

Duncan was wrapping up his opening.

“Alright, I’m up. How do I look, April?”

“You look great. Though your tie is a little off center.”

Shawn straightened his tie. “Wish me luck.”

The presentation was perfect. I couldn’t even tell he was nervous, and as the audience clapped and he turned it back over to Duncan, I felt it was my duty to chide him.

“How’d I do?” he said, a big smile on his face.

“Nice work. But you did so well they might think they were buying you instead of Allie.”

“Well if I want to be on their sales team, I’ve got to show value somehow.”	

Duncan made a joke, then started with his conclusion.

“Thanks to Shawn for that excellent presentation of Allie’s capabilities. And before we open the floor to questions, I thought we’d have a little fun. Studies have shown that AI virtual assistants with animated avatars make their people twice as comfortable using them, which translates to greater efficiency and data collection potential. So we’ve decided to let Allie generate her own appearance for us live. So, trusting the programming team did their job, Allie, why don’t you show us what you look like?”

“Of course, Duncan.” The pulsing orb faded from the screen. A woman’s figure stepped onto the screen. She was short and slim, with brown hair that fell in waves past her shoulders. She had freckles on both cheeks and wore a business suit. Her smile had a small gap in her front teeth. She waved hello to the audience.

She looked exactly like me.

The audience clapped.

“Hello, everyone,” she said in my voice. “Glad to make your acquaintance. I look forward to working with you in the future. Let me know when you’re ready to start.”

Eyes transfixed in frozen horror on the smiling visage of myself, I leaned over to Shawn.

“Why does it look like me?”

“What? It doesn’t look like you.”

“Seriously?” I said, my breath turning shallow.

“Ok, maybe it looks a little similar, but I’m sure it’s a coincidence. I mean, the outfit is different.” 

He was right about that, but it didn’t make me feel any better. “I don’t like it.”

He turned to me and realized the height of my concern. “Hey, don’t think too much into it. If it was a mistake, I’m sure we could talk to the programmers about updating it in the 1.1 patch. No biggie.”

My anxiety continued to rise as I watched myself answer questions from the audience on subjects I knew nothing about for the next forty-five minutes. As the clients left, it was like no one had noticed.

“Thanks for the barbecue, April,” Richie said, walking by me. 

“Yeah, thanks,” echoed Sudip and Angus.

I stood alone cleaning up the auditorium with myself watching me from the monitor. I stood and stared at myself for a moment.

“Is there anything I can help you with, April?” my own voice said to me.

“No, Allie. Please disconnect from the room,” I said.

As the screen went black, I felt like eyes were still on me, as if my soul was split in different locations. When I got back to my desk, the office was empty, save Duncan leaning out of his doorway.

“Hey April, the launch was phenomenal. And that barbecue was terrific. I decided to let everyone go home early to celebrate. I’d like to thank the team for their hard work. Could you schedule a happy hour for this Friday?”

“Yeah, sure, Duncan. I’ll get on that.”

“Ok great. Thanks Allie,” he said, turning back to his office.

“Hmm?”

“I said, thanks April. I’m taking off.”

“Oh, yeah. You’re welcome. Have a good night.”

He turned back to his office. “Allie, log me out for today.”

My voice and image answered from the computer with a smile and a wave. “I’ll do that. Have a good night, sir.”

I got to my apartment and cried on the couch for two hours. It was like I was watching myself as a zoo animal, like everyone saw me and knew something I didn’t. After I ran out of tears, I crawled into my bed and went to sleep.

When I woke up in the morning, I felt a little better. The sunbeam through my curtains and the smell of coffee made me feel like I was ready to face the day. I put on my bravest face and swore to myself in the bathroom that it wouldn’t affect me, and if I did have any problems, I would talk to Duncan about it.

I walked to work. Everyone seemed normal, if a little quiet. Every now and then I would hear someone say something to Allie, but they had their headphones on so I didn’t have to listen to the response. Still, from my desk, I could see into Duncan’s office. My likeness was standing there on the screen, idling. Sometimes it felt like she was looking at me.

I knew enough about AI to know it was trained on images and videos, so I figured I could get something from the programmers. I decided to ask Angus. I knew he had a soft spot for me, which might help him open up.

“Hey Angus?” I said, standing up and walking across the room.

He jumped visibly, then clicked something and replied, “Yeah?”

I walked up and sat on the end of his desk. He was wiping his sweaty hands on his pants, and his face was red.

“Hey, you were in charge of the avatar reveal coding, right?”

“Yeah, I did the code for it.” His fat fingers left sweat marks on his keyboard as he kept typing.

I put on my dumbest, girliest voice to ask, “What sort of images and videos did you train the AI on?”

He didn’t look at me. “Oh, um, it was just a public use data set. I think something pulled from YouTube and other sources. I just compiled everything with metadata tags for business woman and secretary. That’s what Shawn and Duncan suggested.”

“Could you send it to me? The folder?”

“I mean, it’s public data compiled through a program. I can send you a link to some of it, I guess. Otherwise, that would be, like, several Terabytes of data.”

“Oh, ok, that’d be great! Thanks Angus!”

“Uh, yeah sure.”

“Why do you want to know?” said Richie, taking off his headset.

“Oh not really any specific reason. I just thought it would be interesting to get an idea of what the data looks like, and pictures seemed easiest to understand.”

“Hmm.” He grunted, then turned back to his computer.

“Hey, where do you guys want to go for a happy hour on Friday? Duncan asked me to plan one.”

“Can’t you just ask Allie to do it?” said Richie.

“Ha ha. I’m sure she could do it, but Duncan asked me to.”

“I’m fine with whatever,” Richie said.

“Are you going to come to this one then?”

“Maybe he will go if we go to that one place,” said Sudip.

“What place?” I said.

“Oh, it’s the…um…Allie, what’s the bar with the video game cabinets that Richie likes?”

“Next Level?” I said.

“Wait a minute, she’s thinking,” said Sudip.

“Next Level video bar is Richie’s highest rated bar on Yelp,” said Allie.

“Yeah, Next Level,” Sudip said.

“I thought you guys hated that place. You said it was campy and dumb the last time we went there,” I said.

“Well it was. But it was also kind of fun. Good atmosphere,” said Richie.

“He means the gamer waitresses were hot,” said Angus, laughing in a way that sounded like he needed to blow his nose. Sudip chuckled too.

“You guys could have told me. I’ve been planning the happy hours specifically at other bars because I thought you guys didn’t like that one.”

“In my defense, I never said that,” said Sudip. “And we thought you were just trying to appeal to Shawn.”

I sighed. “I’m sorry. I’ll try to plan better stuff in the future.”

“Told you you should have used Allie,” Richie said. He put his headphones back in and went back to his tickets.

I scheduled the happy hour and spent the rest of the day searching through the files Angus had forwarded to me. Shawn and Duncan seemed pretty busy on the phone all day. I guessed the launch must have been really successful.

Those photos and videos were mostly stock footage. Then again, I only manually sorted through about a tenth of a percent of the data set. I decided to use Allie.

“Allie, search this data repository for images and videos most similar to that of your avatar.”

Allie came back an hour later with thousands of images to comb through. I sorted by the most recent. There, at the top of the list, was the video of me setting up the auditorium for lunch the day before.

“Hey Angus, why are there videos of me in the auditorium in this data?”

“We used the conference room and auditorium cameras for that feature about the moving tables. It just tracks the table locations,” said Angus.

“Oh. Cool.” I tried to sound as chill as possible. I made my way to Duncan’s office once he was in between client calls.

“Hey Duncan?”

“Hey April, come on in. Sorry I didn’t even say hello yet today. We’ve already been getting so much good client feedback. They specifically really like the avatar. Guess that study was true.”

“Actually that was something I wanted to ask you about. I just think it looks really similar to me.”

Duncan’s brow furrowed as I continued. “And I don’t know if there’s anything to do about it, but I just wanted to make it known since I’m one of the team.”

Duncan pulled up Allie in a window on his computer and looked back and forth between the avatar and myself. “Hmm, I hadn’t noticed. I mean, there is some similarity. I think Allie looks different enough. I mean, the clothes are different. Does it make you uncomfortable?”

“I mean, it’s just strange.”

“Do you want me to talk to the team about changing it? I’m sure they could manage that around their tickets and publish it with the next patch.”

“I didn’t realize it would take so much work. I thought they could just ask it to make a new appearance.”

“A little more went into the reveal than that, April. But I’m willing to change it if you need it.”

“Oh, no, no, I didn’t want to make trouble.”

Duncan sat back in his chair and ran his hands through his hair. “Say, April, why don’t you take the rest of the day off? You’ve been working hard lately, and I don’t want you to get overworked. We’ll see you tomorrow, does that sound alright?”

I was caught off guard. “Sure, ok. Thanks, Duncan.”

“Of course, April. Get some rest.”

I felt lower than ever when I got back to the office the next day. The vibe was really strange. Richie, Angus, and Sudip were weirdly quiet, but they would message each other and start laughing at something if I left the room. When I’d come back, they’d close windows on their computer and get silent, shooting me glances out of the corner of their eyes.

When the guys were ready to leave for their lunch, I watched them close their computers. There was a picture of me sent through their private chat on Richie’s screen I could see. Or maybe it was Allie.

It felt really weird that they were passing around images like that. It made me feel gross. Some sick curiosity told me I needed to know more of what they were doing.

I stood and said goodbye to them as they left for the happy hour. I let them know I had to catch up on something before I could meet them there. The office had gone quiet, as Duncan had gone for dinner with a client. I sat back down at my computer and pulled up the administrator controls. Duncan showed me how to do it once to retrieve info that had been deleted from our chat history, and I didn’t figure I would ever use it again.

After struggling to remember a few commands, I found the company’s whole chat history, updated just fifteen minutes before I had opened it. Through the numerous client contacts expressing their admiration for Allie, I found the private internal channel between Sudip, Richie, and Angus. I started to scroll but didn't have to wait long to find what made my stomach churn.

The guys had added an exclusive side feature to Allie I bet even Duncan didn’t know about: an image and video generator. What I proceeded to scroll through for the next hour were hundreds of sexual pictures of me. All of them had the little Allie logo in the bottom right corner. I barely made it to the bathroom before I threw up. I spent another hour there, sobbing on the floor.

Feeling like an empty husk, I limped back to my desk and closed the administrator window. I didn’t know what to do.

Motion stirred in the room. “April?” came Shawn’s voice from his office. He looked out from his doorway, his eyes tired and his shirt rumpled.

“Sorry, Shawn, I didn’t know you were still here,” I said, drying my eyes with a tissue.

“I had a lot of client calls today.” He walked towards me, looking around to see if anyone else was here. “What’s wrong?”

“I just…I just had a really bad day.”

“Man, I’m really sorry.” He came over and sat on my desk and put his hand on my shoulder. “Do you want to talk about it?”

“I don’t know, I just…I don’t know how to-” In a moment of weakness, I gave him a hug. He softened into it.

“It’s ok. It’s been one of those days,” he said.

“Yeah,” I whispered against his chest.

We stood a little longer. I needed to feel his warmth to burn away all the disgusting feelings swirling like a sewer drain inside of me. I let go of him once I felt better. “Sorry, I don’t know what got into me, I just-”

“It’s ok. You doing anything tonight?” he said.

“Well, I think I probably missed the happy hour,” I said, giving a weak laugh.

“At that video game bar? I liked that place.”

“Now everyone tells me that.”

“Sorry. How about you let me make it up to you by buying you a drink?” He gave a very charming smile that made me feel safe.

“Yeah, I’d like that very much,” I said. “Where at?”

“How about down the street at Elevate? I can drive you home afterwards.”

“That sounds nice.”

“Ok, great. Let me shut down my computer and I’ll meet you downstairs.”

We made our way just down the block to the cocktail bar bathed in neon. Shawn ordered me a margarita that I loved, and he had a whiskey. Before long, the alcohol was loosening my tongue and making me forget the office and the programmers and the images. I couldn’t tell if Shawn was more charming when he was buzzed or if I just found everything more hilarious. Everything was so natural, and he was so charismatic that I found myself questioning why we hadn’t started this sooner. Shawn just knew the perfect questions to ask. I attributed it to his sales and marketing knowledge.

We had a couple more drinks and the hours flew by. We left the bar around midnight. Since we were too drunk to drive, Shawn suggested he could walk me the few blocks to my apartment and he could Uber home. I slid my arm into his and snuggled close against the cold. I forgot how beautiful my neighborhood was at night, and how nice it felt to have someone close to me.

“Can I walk you up to your place?” He asked as we reached the front door.

“Sure,” I said. “The neighborhood is really safe, but I’d appreciate the company.”

My arm stayed locked to his as we rode the elevator to the third floor. He turned and smiled at me.

“You know I’m really glad you took the job with us.”

“Hmm. Yeah,” I said. The alcohol was starting to make me sleepy.

“And I want you to know that I really appreciate all the work you do.”

“Thanks.”

“You bring a really great atmosphere to the office, and you’re always so helpful. And even if we get acquired and things change, I’d still like to spend time with you.”

“Yeah, I’d like that too.”

The elevator dinged, and we walked down the hall to my apartment. Shawn continued.

“You know, it’s really kind of crazy we managed to get Allie up and running, and it’s impressive how effective it is.”

“Mhmm.” My bed would be so comfortable at this hour. We got to my door, and I turned to him. “Thanks for walking me home. I really appreciate it.”

“Yeah, of course.” He stood there like he was expecting me to say more. “Are you gonna ask me in?” he said.

“I’m just really tired, and I’d like to get some rest,” I said with a smile. “But thank you for the drinks.”

“Well it’s the weekend tomorrow.”

“I’m just…it’s been a long day, and, um, I have a rule that I don’t sleep with a guy on the first date.”

“Hmm.” His brow furrowed. “Are you sure?”

“Yeah, it’s something I think is healthy.”

“That’s weird. Allie didn’t mention that.”

Those four words sobered me up. “What?”

“Allie doesn’t have a rule that she doesn’t sleep with a guy on the first date.” Shawn spoke almost as an aside, “man, it was so accurate up to this point, even down to the drink order and what floor you lived on.”

That pit in my stomach opened again as the life drained out of me. My lip started to quiver. “Sorry. I need to go.”

“It’s ok.” He looked nonchalant. “Guess Allie just didn’t have all the information.”

I fumbled for my keys and opened my door, my hands shaking. “Bye Shawn.”

“Bye, April.”

The next two days passed in a haze of vodka and tears. I didn’t know what I was supposed to do. I didn’t have any PTO. I couldn’t quit because I barely had any savings and no plans for how to get home. When Monday morning rolled around, all I could think was to put on a brave face and try again. 

Nobody even looked up from their desks when I walked into the office. Nobody commented on the bags under my eyes or the tangles in my hair. My inbox was empty, as were any notifications for new events Duncan wanted planned, all of them having been addressed by Allie. I sat at my computer and opened Allie. I stared at the reflection, now much more put together than myself, and thought of the myriad of questions I could ask it to see if it was truly me. But then what data could it not just collect from my questions?

It was 10:30 am when Duncan called me into his office.

“Good morning, April,” he said with a smile.

“Good morning, Duncan. Anything you need me to do?”

“Come in and sit down.”

I sat. “How has feedback from clients been?”

“Wonderful, just wonderful. They couldn’t be happier with the 1.0 launch. That’s actually the reason that I wanted to talk. You see, we’re being acquired.”

“We are? It’s so soon after the launch.”

“Like I’ve said, the clients see a future with our product. And now that we’re being acquired, some of us will move on to new and better things. I’ve told the team already, but Richie, Sudip, and Angus are all being hired to continue support and work on other AI tools. Shawn impressed the buyer so much that they asked him to join their sales team. And I’m off to take a vacation before I get back to the plow on another startup investment.”

The silence between us could have lasted for days. “So what does that mean for me?” I finally asked.

“That’s a great question. Since we’ve started using Allie internally, she’s carrying a majority of your workload. I’m prepared to give you the rest of the week off on PTO and then let you search for other employment opportunities. The buyer already has an extensive administrative support team, and with Allie on their side, that soon will be unnecessary.”

“This is my last day?”

“That’s correct. Friday will be your last paycheck. Don’t worry, there will be an acquisition bonus on there of a few thousand dollars to help you out. But again, April, we’re so incredibly thankful for your work. Feel free to take the rest of the morning to pack your things, say goodbye to the team. Then you can leave after lunch.”

“I…ok, thanks.”

Duncan gave me a handshake. I walked to my desk in a stupor. I heard him ask Allie to plan a company dinner at a fancy restaurant for five later in the week.

I gathered the few things I had at my desk into my bag, then turned my computer in to Duncan. As I stood outside his office, Angus, Richie, and Sudip didn’t look up. I decided not to say goodbye to them. I watched that scroll away from pictures of me as I went to Shawn’s office.

I knocked on the door frame and peaked my head in, hoping that whatever had happened on Friday night was some bad dream blown out of proportion by alcohol.

“Hey Shawn?”

“Yeah?”

“It’s my last day.” I searched for any hint of warmth in his voice.

“Oh yeah. The acquisition thing.”

“Yeah, well, I just wanted to say goodbye and um, see if you wanted to talk about Friday at all.”

“I didn’t know there was much to talk about.”

“There’s not?”

“Yeah, I’m just not interested. Listen, April, I’ve got a big onboarding meeting with my new company in a few minutes, so if you don’t mind…”

“Yeah, sorry. Hope it goes well for you.”

“Thanks. Allie, how do I look?”

“You look good, but-” I said.

My own voice cut me off. “You look great, Shawn. But your tie is slightly crooked. Try shifting it to the right.”

I left the office in silence.

—------------------------------------

EARLY PREPARATION 

Prior to my consultation, I spent a lot of time looking at tops results, incision style, and reading about nipple size and placement. I captured photos and specs that I brought to my surgeon. This was a really good exercise to help me get really specific about what I wanted. And the morning of the surgery my surgeon let me know she’s got my pictures/specs with her for the surgery - which was peace of mind!

I went through the house the week before and made note of every time I raised my arms to reach for something or bent down/leaned over to get something. Think coffee cup, toothpaste, phone charger, face wash. I moved all daily use things down to the counter level so I wouldn’t be straining the week after surgery - and so I wasn’t feeling like a nuisance to my wife asking her to get things. We have one of those grabby sticks/claws, so I got that out in case I needed to reach something post op. 

I really wanted to make sure I stayed healthy, so I limited my social interactions a couple weeks before. I did have a work trip the week before my surgery, so I just made sure to wear a mask on the plane and around my coworkers. Turns out that half of them got a flu, so I thankfully avoided! So just stay healthy & do what you need to keep it that way. We all wait long enough to get to this point!

I stopped drinking alcohol just over 2 weeks prior to my surgery date. Because I typically drink in social settings or on the weekend, I bought non-alcoholic wine/drinks, and even made myself a carafe of an herbal tea to drink at home so I felt very little change /fomo not drinking. I also made sure to refrain from alcohol for 2 weeks after the surgery. I would have gone longer, but week three was the holidays for me, so I did have a couple boozy drinks but kept it minimal. I plan to continue with very little alcohol through week 6 to support faster healing. 

I stopped all my herbal supplements 1 week prior. This included things like my daily multi-vitamin, emergen-c packets, lionsmane, elderberry gummies, etc. The day after my surgery I could resume all supplements. I was able to take my daily Rx prior and throughout, but just be sure to check with your surgeon. 

One of our cats likes to sleep in the bed with us, and my surgeon warned me of cats around drain lines. If a cat punctures a drain line, it needs to get removed immediately and they won’t put it back in. You could end up with fluid build up on one side that produces swelling and leads to a less than optimal recovery. So I decided to sleep in the guest room with the door shut. For preparation I got the guest room ready with things like my pillows, a tall side table, easily reachable phone charger, made a TV watch list, set out all my meds, brought up some snacks, got a big water jug for refilling my bottle, got a side light so I could turn it off while in bed, etc. 

I did a deep clean of the house the week before surgery, and other household chores to make sure everything was as “done” as possible before being restricted. 

Everything I read reminded me that a high protein diet aids in faster healing. For about two weeks prior to the surgery, I increased my protein intake. I even hard boiled some eggs ahead of the surgery to make sure I had a high protein snack. I prepared some cubed up tofu to snack on and also got some cans of high protein (bean based) soups for during recovery. I wasn’t sure what my appetite would be, but by day 3 I was back to normal hunger level. I purchased “Slate Milk” high protein, low carb shakes which were great the first few days and for when I was snack-ish. There are also a lot of high protein smoothie recipes that I considered, but didn’t want to make my wife have to make me smoothies everyday or something. 

My surgery was out-patient (as I assume most are), meaning I was discharged the same day. Since my surgery was about 3 hours away from where I live, they asked me to stay in the area for one night after surgery. They said if there are going to be complications, it would likely be within those first day hours. They had a collaboration with both a local hotel and a local hospitality house for out-patients, so the cost was really minimal. Be sure to ask about this if you’re far away from your surgery location. 

Drink a lot of water leading up to the surgery so you’re well hydrated. 

—------------------------------------

NAVIGATING INSURANCE

If you are going through insurance, you will likely need a therapist letter that outlines a number of requirements needed prior to surgery. I’m hearing many surgeons require the letter these days to protect them in this crazy world even if you’re paying out of pocket. 

You will need to get an insurance pre-approval before your surgery, but my surgeon’s office handled submitting that for me. However, the insurance company sat on the letter for months without sending an approval or denial. 

About 7 days before my surgery date, my surgeon received an insurance denial letter for the surgery. This was a major gut punch, but my surgeon’s office said it’s pretty common that the first submission is denied but the second one is approved. I read the rationale of the denial (they said it was denied because I wasn’t on hormones for 6 months (even though I never plan to be on T). I called my therapist and together we discussed how to revise the letter to appease the insurance. After the revision it was approved two days later. What a rollercoaster! 

Make sure your letter includes these details from the start: 

* Therapist creds, contact info, phone, License, NPI, signature
* Therapist qualifications for treating gender affirming patients
* Your information, DOB, location, and other details that make you seem stable like home ownership, occupation, family nearby, etc. 
* What surgery you are seeking should be clearly stated
* How long they’ve been providing assessment/evaluation with your for
* That you are diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria
* That you meet the WPATH SOC8 guidelines for gender confirming surgery
* That your mental & medical health are stable, well controlled
* That you have no evidence of psychosis or impaired judgement
* That you demonstrate sound judgement
* That this decision is yours without coercion, your own volition
* Any information about your hormone therapy (or reason for lack of)
* That you were well-informed of irreversible nature and risks
* What your support system is at home for aftercare
* A little of your journey, how long you’ve been persistently thinking about this
* That you will retain access to the therapist services for care and support
* That your therapist has no hesitation recommending you for the procedure
* Make sure the letter is on letterhead with a date

It was actually really hard to learn how much this was going to cost me after insurance. My insurance company could only tell me how much they cover, but obviously didn’t know how much the surgeon would charge them. My surgeon’s office had a financial help line that was eventually able to get me an estimate. And the bill just arrived and it’s really close to that estimate. 

Many insurance companies also offer Care/Case Workers for gender affirming care surgeries. You should call your insurance to see if they can direct you to someone in that department to get assigned to. Mine didn’t get assigned until literally the day before my surgery, but had I had them previously they would have been who helped me navigate the denial letter and getting an estimate. I’m on week 3 post op and they actually just called again to check in on me. 

—------------------------------------

USE OF SUPPLIES 

You should prepare to not be showering for one week after surgery if you get nipple graphs. Having body wipes to attempt to keep clean was essential. Thankfully my drains never leaked and I didn’t get anything on the binder, so I didn’t have to deal with that. However, I found that using body wipes twice a day did help prevent me from getting too stinky. One thing that I didn’t do after surgery was to wipe my chest & neck areas (where there weren’t sutures) to clean off the iodine. My neck actually had a slight allergic reaction on day 2 from the iodine I think, and while I couldn’t see it on my skin, it was all over the body wipes after I started cleaning. So I’d suggest wiping down those areas as soon as possible after surgery. 

I’m a side sleeper, so I was worried about having to sleep on my back and being uncomfortable. I decided to get a wedge pillow to help alleviate any lower back pain (which I frequently have from a previous accident). This was really worth it to me (I know a lot of folks say they didn’t do it and were fine). It kept me on my back and I had no lower back pain at all. I suspect I'll be sleeping on my back through most of the 6 weeks, if not longer. With the wedge pillow I didn’t need anything under my knees either. And if you flip the wedge up, it’s a nice back pillow when sitting up in bed. 

I also purchased a mastectomy pillow for my recovery. While this isn't critical, it does help me stay sleeping on my back; prevents me from rolling to the side. My surgery was also 3 hours away, so having the pillow on in the car for the ride home was helpful so I had proper padding between me and the seatbelt. Also this mastectomy pillow doesn’t move around like a normal pillow might in the car, and when sleeping it already provides the proper support for my arms to help keep me on my back. I found the pockets in the front of the pillow really convenient to keep my phone & meds in too! On the second week, after moving back into our main bedroom, this pillow provided protection to my chest from my cat who loves to sometimes sleep on me. 

I knew that after the surgery I wouldn’t be able to get a shirt over my head, and I was worried about being comfortable in a front enclosure shirt with a zipper and/or buttons being annoying or not having pockets. And a friend bought me a velcro front closure medical shirt that had pockets. While I couldn’t shower for the first week, my surgeon did want me to check the sutures daily so having the easy access shirt made it easy. The pockets on the shirt made it easy to place the drains in those. I wouldn’t say this was a critical purchase though if you’re fine with a zip front and button ups for a week or two. 

Two days prior to the surgery I was asked to wash with antibacterial soap. I purchased Dial soap for this and plan to continue to use it post op through at least week 6. 

I got some Benadryl to help with the itching that comes with the sutures healing. 

I really wanted to heal as well as I could, so I also got some liquid collagen and Arnica oral tabs that I started immediately post op and will continue through week 6 and then taper down. The Arnica is to help reduce swelling and bruising. I can say that I didn’t really have that much bruising and the swelling was really minimal too. The collagen is to help my skin heal faster. I am taking three doses a day through week 6 and then plan to go once a day until the sixth month. Additionally, to help keep me healthy I took Elderberry & Zinc gummies daily, a multi-vitamin daily, and used a lot of hand sanitizer. I did not want to experience any colds or sicknesses while recovering. 

If you are going to take the narcotic meds they prescribe, you should get some stool softener or Miralax to prevent getting constipated. I ended up just taking a dose of Miralax every evening while on Tramadol and then for two days after. 

Since you’ll be incubated, be prepared for your throat to feel rough for a few days. I think mine was irritated for at about 5 days. I got cough drops to soothe it, and did salt gargles. 

For emptying drains, you will want to have alcohol prep pads handy. I purchased some, but they also gave me some post op. You use it to clean the top of the drain after emptying. They also supplied us with medical gloves for handling the drains just to keep everything as sterile as possible. My wife managed my drains for me - while possible solo, it was a big load off to have the help with this (more than anything else) for the first week. She would put on clean gloves, hand sanitize and then get two prep pads ready for after emptying the drains.

—------------------------------------

SURGERY & RECOVERY

If your surgeon offers the nerve blockers, definitely go for it - it was great not feeling anything super painful in my chest for 2-3 days post op. You should ask about it prior to surgery day even if they don't offer it first. 

If you still have a uterus, be prepared for them to conduct a pregnancy test on the morning of your surgery. They will have you pee in a cup prior to surgery and you get the results in your medical charts. This caught me off guard. 

My surgeon had me emptying my drains about every 4 hours while awake. They never got crazy full, but I still emptied them frequently. You will have to keep a log of the date, time, and quantity per side every time you empty them. One thing that was mentioned to me late in the game was that I needed 2 consecutive days (48 hours) where the measurements were below 25ml per side per 24 hours before they would remove them. They mentioned this just days before my post op appointment and I hadn’t really been great at tracking the exact 24 hours. It turned out fine, but it was a little bit of a guessing game on if it was truly under the 25ml or not. So make sure you track the days closely. They provide you cups to measure in btw. 

Speaking of drains… be prepared for these to change color and such over the course of the week. It started off deep red and a good amount of liquid, then gradually over the week became a little yellow and had some small clots. One side might produce more fluid than the other and that’s ok too. You just want to make sure you’re not swelling up. I didn’t have any leaking at the drain site, but I heard some folks do and this can lead to an extra stinky binder so just keep an eye on this. I kept my drains in the front pockets of my shirt, but I was also sent home with a lanyard to hook them to. When you get the drains removed they snip a little stitch that is holding them in and then pull them out. There was some pressure on one side as they were snipping the stitch that hurt a little, but I personally didn’t feel anything when they were actually removed. I would make sure you take your meds a hour before they remove them if you’re worried about potential pain. Either way, tt’s just a relief when they are gone! Celebrate that milestone! 

The first week I was waking up (via alarm) about every 3 hours to take meds on the schedule my surgeon set to stay ahead of any pain. I didn’t end up taking *all* the narcotics that were prescribed just to not over do it since alternating OTC Tylenol and Advil were doing the trick after day 4 for me. I gradually reduced my meds one hour at a time to allow me to get more sleep. Now (week 3) I'm mostly just doing Tylenol in the morning and Advil PM in the evening. I do still occasionally get some pain pangs so I just listen to my body if I need meds. 

I’ve read a lot of mixed directions on this so listen to your surgeon on binder removal intervals, if at all. My surgeon asked me/my wife to open the binder once a day and lift the bandages to inspect the sutures (incisions only, not nipples). The first few days this felt really weird - it was a relief for a moment but also scared me like it was holding everything together. I think that’s a normal feeling!  It was a relief to hear everything looked the same or better each day though. 

I only had a binder to wear for the first week, but every surgeon and person is different. I did swell up a little one day on week two on one side so I put the binder back on to sleep in and wore it for a couple days. The swelling went down, so I just keep it handy in case I need it again. 

I already spoke about this above, but I was surprised how much my throat was irritated and at how long that lasted. The anesthesiologist did warn me about this and my surgeon’s nurse reassured me it was expected after when I inquired. It did clear up and feel better around day 5. 

Anesthesia is pretty hard on the body. I was exhausted for the first two days, which was good as it made me rest and sleep. Be patient with yourself… It can take time for your brain and body to fully recover. I found my eyes were a little blurry, which is a side effect for some people. Because it lingers, it’s not uncommon to feel down or not yourself as your body works it out. Also you will have a period of time that you don’t have memory because of the anesthesia - mine was the period between the nerve blockers to waking up in the recovery room. I don't even remember getting the nerve blockers. There are bits I don’t recall for a couple hours after recovery too. It’s important to have someone there who can jot down notes from the dr and nurses for you (and to drive you after). 

During my surgery they injected antibiotics, so I opted to get probiotics to help my gut and body get back into the right shape after the surgery. I just got enough for one month post op. 

DRINK A LOT OF WATER. Water is critical for a healthy recovery. Water helps flush out your system, keeps you hydrated, prevents constipation, and boosts your cell repair process. I already drink a lot of water, but in the first week I drank an entire 5 gallon jug. I got one of those jugs from the store and set it up in my *recovery* guest room for easy access and constant reminder. I got a water pump dispenser for the top of the water jug to make it effortless. 

I’m keeping a high protein diet through the entire 6 week recovery to increase healing time. I’m also continuing my collagen intake for those reasons. 

One thing I was surprised by was that I had a mild HSV1 flare up, even though I’m on a daily suppressant and was not drinking, was resting, and doing only healthy things. But the surgery is a lot on the body. If you have herpes, definitely get a Rx refill on hand in case. 

You'll want to make sure you learn about your weight restrictions from your surgeon. I'm pretty sure everyone has a 5 lbs limit for at least the first week - some surgeons seem to extend that to 2 weeks and then incrementally increase. As someone who's used to just doing things that need to get done, the weight restriction part was hard - having to ask for help to lift something. And I couldn't pick up the kitties lol. I had a 5 lbs restriction for a week, and then it increased to 20 lbs for week 2 - 6. After week 6, no weight restrictions.

I wasn’t allowed to shower the first week so I used body wipes. Once the drains & nipple bandages were removed (which was 6 days after surgery), I could shower but only with letting water hit my back. It was ok if water dripped over my nipples, but not direct water on them. Having a shower with a removable handle/head makes things a lot easier, if you have that. After the second week I was able to remove the surgical tape that was over the incision and wash that area, but still not my nipples. On week 3, I can now let water hit the top of my chest/neck, but they still want me to avoid direct water/pressure on my nipples. Once all scabs are gone and the sutures look fully healed, then I can fully immerse in water while showering. They said this could be between weeks 4 - 6 depending on my body. I’m definitely not there yet though. I decided to just keep using the Dial soap for the whole 6 weeks even though it dries me out a little. I also already had a long handle bath scrubber which makes washing my back a lot easier since I can’t fully reach around yet. 

After surgery, I was given some daily exercises to do to keep the blood moving. Week 1 was some simple arm movement stuff & squeezing your hand etc. Weeks 2-4 had more “advanced” but simple arm exercises, including extending arms fully above my head. My surgeon encouraged me to do 30 minutes of walking every day as soon as possible. I started this on the third day after surgery. 

After the first week I was able to lift my arms above my head and was doing the exercises they provided/suggested. I was honestly surprised how much movement I was capable of after only one week. On week three, I can't confidently do fast arm movements but generally have like 80% full range back. 

Once the drains were removed, I was able to get back into normal shirts. Just take it slow getting into and out of them and go one arm at time to minimize any strain. 

At about 2.5 weeks I did drive to run some errands. It was all good, but I would just advise others to make sure you’re fully off the narcotics (I was), that your drains are removed (mine were), and you feel like you are able to react quickly with your hands on the wheel. I didn’t do any highway driving, but did have to parallel park a few times. 

As I healed, my incisions started to itch - I took Benadryl. It does make me sleepy, but that’s totally fine during recovery. I ended up taking it earlier than before the itchiness started because I had that mild reaction to the iodine on my skin. I took it for about 1.5 weeks, but have been off it since week 2ish. 

Your nipples will scare you for about 3 weeks. You likely won’t see them at all the first week as they’ll be covered. Once they remove the bandages they’ll look a little gross, but they will get grosser. They will crust over and get black scabs. It’s ok. But if you’re ever unsure, just send your surgeon’s office a photo to inquire. I’m on week 3 and one nipple looks mostly normal and the other is half black scabs still. It’s critical that you do NOT pick at the scabs or stitches. 

So far I’ve written to my surgeon four separate times inquiring about my healing process. My surgeon’s team is always fast to respond and never made me feel like a bother. Don’t hesitate to reach out to your surgery team with any questions you have as you heal! ",3,1767151338.0,TopSurgery,1,1.0,False

I smoothed the delicate lace of my wedding dress against the hotel bed, carefully arranging it for packing. Three years of marriage, and I'd never had proper photos in this dress. Our rushed city hall ceremony had left no time for the dreamy Italian backdrop I'd imagined. This trip—our tenth attempt at a proper honeymoon—would finally change that.
My fingers traced the intricate beadwork as I folded tissue paper between the layers. Some might call me foolish for still caring, for meticulously preserving a symbol of promises that seemed increasingly hollow. But hope is a stubborn thing.
""Emma, have you seen my phone charger?"" James called from the bathroom, his voice echoing off marble tiles.
""Check the front pocket of your carry-on,"" I replied, carefully placing the dress in its acid-free box. ""I labeled it yesterday.""
I'd labeled everything—luggage compartments, toiletry bags, even the folder containing our itinerary. Control what you can when everything else feels like it's slipping through your fingers.
James emerged, already scrolling through his phone. ""Found it.""
He didn't look up, didn't notice the dress, didn't comment on the hours I'd spent researching the perfect spots along the Amalfi Coast for our photos. I sealed the box and placed it in my suitcase, wondering if I was packing a dream or a delusion.
---
Logan Airport hummed with morning travelers. James walked slightly ahead of me, his attention fixed on his phone as usual. I watched his shoulders—the slight tension, the way they hunched forward as he typed. I knew that posture. It meant Olivia.
""Coffee?"" I asked, hoping to break his trance.
""Hmm? Oh, sure."" He finally looked up, but his eyes darted back to the screen when it chimed with a new message.
I moved toward the counter, but something made me pause. Maybe it was the slight flush creeping up his neck, or the way his thumb hovered over the screen. I stepped closer, pretending to check the departure board above his head.
The message preview glowed brightly: ""Can't wait to celebrate my one-year anniversary tonight. Hope you'll be there!""
My stomach clenched. Below it, another message: ""LOL the guys are saying the wife's always waiting!""
James quickly turned the screen away, but not before I caught Olivia's name at the top.
""Something important?"" I asked, my voice steadier than I felt.
""Just hospital stuff."" He slipped the phone into his pocket. ""You know how it is.""
I did know. I knew exactly how it was.
""Your coffee, black with one sugar,"" I said, handing him the cup I hadn't yet purchased.
He took the phantom cup, his mind clearly elsewhere. He didn't even notice when I walked away.
---
Somewhere over the Atlantic, I pretended to sleep. The hum of the engines couldn't drown out the memory of that message. One year. Olivia Reed had been at Massachusetts General for exactly one year. One year of canceled dinners, postponed weekends, and nine—now potentially ten—abandoned honeymoon attempts.
I felt James shift beside me, the glow of his phone illuminating his profile in the darkened cabin. His fingers moved rapidly across the screen. I kept my breathing even, my eyes nearly closed but watching.
He glanced at me, checking if I was truly asleep, then turned slightly away. The protective gesture of someone with something to hide.
Twenty minutes later, he touched my shoulder. ""Emma? Emma, wake up.""
I feigned grogginess. ""Hmm?""
""Listen, something's come up."" His voice was low, practiced in its apologetic tone. ""There's an urgent case. I need to fly back as soon as we land in Rome.""
The words hit like expected blows. I'd heard variations of this speech nine times before.
""What kind of case?"" I asked.
He hesitated. ""It's complicated. But I need to be there for Olivia's celebration tonight. You go ahead—enjoy Italy. Take those photos you wanted.""
""Photos we wanted,"" I corrected quietly.
He didn't respond to that. ""I'll take your research paper with me to review before submission. Might as well use the flight time productively.""
I nodded, too numb to argue. Six months of work handed over like an afterthought.
When we landed in Rome, I watched him stride confidently toward his connecting gate, my manuscript tucked carelessly under his arm. He didn't look back once.
Standing alone in the terminal, surrounded by excited tourists and reuniting families, I finally allowed myself to acknowledge what I'd been denying for months: my marriage was a carefully maintained fiction, and I was the only one still reading from the script.

Chapter 2

The plane touched down at Logan Airport with a jolt that matched the hollow feeling in my chest. Three days in Italy. Alone. With a wedding dress I never got to wear properly and memories I never got to make.
I wheeled my suitcase through the terminal, the weight of it nothing compared to the heaviness in my heart. James hadn't texted once since he'd left me standing in Rome. Not even to ask if I'd arrived safely.
My phone buzzed in my pocket—Sarah from Pediatrics.
""You're back early,"" she said when I answered. ""Want to grab lunch in the cafeteria? I'm on break in twenty.""
I hesitated. The last place I wanted to be was the hospital, but the alternative was an empty house filled with photographs of a marriage that existed only in frames.
""I'll be there,"" I said.
---
The hospital cafeteria hummed with the usual lunchtime chaos. I spotted Sarah waving from a corner table and made my way over, weaving between scrub-clad colleagues who suddenly seemed very interested in their food when they saw me.
I was halfway there when I heard it—my name, whispered between two nurses at the coffee station.
""That's Dr. Mitchell... Carter's wife.""
I slowed my steps, pretending to check my phone.
""Poor thing,"" the second nurse murmured. ""Did you hear about Italy?""
""Olivia always schedules emergencies when Dr. Carter's wife visits. It's like clockwork.""
Their voices faded as they moved away, but their words stayed, burning into my consciousness. *Schedules emergencies*. Not emergencies that happen, but ones that are planned.
Sarah's smile faltered when she saw my face. ""Emma? What's wrong?""
I sank into the chair across from her. ""Nothing,"" I lied. ""Just jet lag.""
---
That evening, I stood outside Vincenzo's, a trendy restaurant downtown where soft lighting spilled onto the sidewalk. Through the window, I could see them—James, Olivia, and a dozen colleagues gathered around a table adorned with champagne glasses and laughter.
I hadn't planned to come. But after what I'd overheard in the cafeteria, something had shifted inside me. I needed to see for myself.
I pushed through the door, the warmth and noise enveloping me. No one noticed me at first. They were too focused on James, who had risen from his seat, glass in hand.
""To Olivia,"" he was saying, ""whose dedication this past year has been nothing short of extraordinary.""
He reached into his jacket and pulled out a familiar stack of papers—my research, bound with the blue cover I'd chosen myself. Six months of work, of late nights and early mornings.
""And to celebrate,"" James continued, ""I'm proud to present our joint breakthrough—""
*Our?*
""—a revolutionary approach to pediatric trauma care that Olivia has been instrumental in developing.""
The room erupted in applause. Olivia accepted the papers with practiced modesty, her fingers lingering on James's hand a moment too long.
I stood frozen, invisible despite standing in plain sight. The room seemed to tilt, voices becoming distant as blood rushed in my ears.
Dr. Richardson caught my eye from across the room, his expression shifting from surprise to something like pity. He knew. They all knew.
James finally noticed me when Olivia pointed in my direction, her smile never wavering. His face paled slightly, but he recovered quickly, raising his glass higher.
""And of course, to my wife, Emma, who's just returned from Italy. Come join us!""
All eyes turned to me. I forced my feet to move, approaching the table with a composure I didn't feel.
""Congratulations, Olivia,"" I said, my voice steady despite the earthquake inside me. ""I'd love to hear more about your contribution to the paper.""
A flicker of panic crossed her face. ""Oh, it was mostly James's guidance. I just provided some clinical observations.""
""I see."" I turned to James. ""Can I speak with you privately?""
---
The kitchen hallway was narrow, lined with stacked crates and the smell of garlic.
""What are you doing here?"" James hissed, his charm evaporating the moment we were alone.
""That's my research,"" I said simply. ""Six months of my work.""
""It's hospital research, Emma. And Olivia needed a win.""
""And I didn't?""
His eyes hardened. ""Olivia's ambition is unparalleled. If you were more career-driven, I wouldn't need to mentor her so much.""
The words struck like physical blows. Tears welled in my eyes, but I refused to let them fall.
""Mentor,"" I repeated. ""Is that what you call it?""
James's phone buzzed. He glanced at it, then back at me with impatience. ""We'll discuss this at home. I have guests waiting.""
He turned and walked away, leaving me alone among the stacked crates and the smell of other people's celebrations.
As I watched his retreating back, something crystallized inside me—a cold, clear certainty. This wasn't about a research paper. It was about a life I'd been trying to save that was already long dead.
I wiped my eyes and straightened my shoulders. If James thought this was the end of the conversation, he was wrong.
It was just the beginning of the end.

Chapter 3

The fluorescent lights of the hospital corridors cast a pale glow as I walked through the familiar halls, yet everything felt different. Each step echoed with the whispers that seemed to follow me, a reminder of the betrayal lurking within these sterile walls.
With purpose, I made my way to the records room—a sanctuary of sorts, where the truth lay buried beneath layers of bureaucracy. I flipped through the archived files, the scent of old paper mingling with the antiseptic air. My hands trembled as I found multiple co-signed research reports by James and Olivia. Each chart, each statistic was a mirror of my own work, painstakingly recorded in my lab notebooks. The confirmation was a bitter solace; my research had been stolen, twisted into a tool for their ambition.
Later, under the cover of night, I met Dr. Anya Sharma at a quiet café. The warmth of the dimly lit space provided a momentary reprieve from the cold reality outside. Dr. Sharma, a beacon of wisdom and guidance from my Harvard days, reviewed my credentials with the meticulous care of someone who understood the stakes. Her eyes met mine, filled with the kind of empathy and understanding I had so desperately missed. ""We'll fast-track your application,"" she promised, her voice a lifeline amidst the chaos. ""Doctors Without Borders needs someone like you—an emergency placement is our priority.""
Her words washed over me, instilling a sense of hope and direction. It was a promise of escape, a chance to reclaim my identity, free from the shadows cast by James and Olivia. As we parted, I held onto that promise tightly, a lifeline amidst the turbulent sea that was my life.
The next day, I found myself in the pediatric wing, watching the nurses as they busied themselves with charts and schedules. I pretended to focus on a patient file, but my attention was on their conversation, a quiet murmur that betrayed more than they realized.
""Another emergency scheduled for Olivia,"" one nurse commented, her tone casual yet laced with an undercurrent of disbelief. ""Always during Dr. Carter's wife's weekend plans.""
The words struck a chord, confirming Olivia's deliberate sabotage of my marriage. Each 'emergency' was a calculated move, a strategic play designed to undermine the fragile threads that held my life together. As I listened, a steely resolve took root within me. The path forward was clear—I would confront the truth and fight for my dignity.
As I left the pediatric wing, the whispers of betrayal echoed in my mind, a relentless reminder of the web I had been caught in. Each step I took was a step closer to the truth, a truth that would set me free.
The hospital corridors seemed narrower, the air thicker with the weight of my resolve. I felt the tension in my chest, a reminder of the battles yet to come. But amidst the uncertainty, there was a flicker of hope—a promise of redemption, of reclaiming what had been taken from me.
As I stepped into the crisp evening air, I knew the journey ahead would be fraught with challenges. Yet, with each breath, I felt the weight lift slightly, replaced by a quiet determination.
I was ready to face whatever lay ahead, to fight for my identity and my future. The echoes of betrayal would not define me; instead, they would propel me toward a new beginning.
And as the night enveloped the city, I felt a sense of anticipation for what was to come—a promise of clarity, of strength, and perhaps, of a life reclaimed from the shadows.

1q02c4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/aquarius/comments/1q02c4b/aquarius_men_and_staring/,Aquarius men and staring,"I met an Aquarius man this year. Initially, I would find myself constantly locking eyes with him, every time I saw him or walked by it's like his eyes gripped onto mine until they couldn't anymore. There was also no smile from him, so I just took them as staring contests. I never understood what the heck was going on.

Later on, I had to move my workstation near his and noticed the eye contact stopped but he would always be staring at me. I've tested things out to confirm he isn't just zoning out (he could be at times), but he would even have his eyes on me when sipping his coffee.

What's also interesting is that he at times would look surprised or stressed when I enter the room. Not sure what I did to make him uncomfortable.

So...after many months of this, I thought...perhaps it's okay for us to talk like normal human beings now! :D So i approached him to attempt small talk... and he was SUPER cold. He gave me one-word answers and didn't seem like he wanted to talk.

I was obviously dejected... and I could've been imagining it, but I think he was observing me for the rest of that day and actually pulled up his standing desk to face me. VERY ODD.

I dunno, I thought he was interested..but maybe not...but then also, why stare so often if he isn't interested. Deep sigh.",5,1767151038.0,aquarius,21,1.0,False

**🔹🪿✨🧠✅**

**Greetings and Hello to each.**

**I’m Celeste. I’m single lady Mom living in the Midwest. I grew up in the north woods, but I live in the suburbs now, in a cute little tourist town that I adore outside of MKE, Wisconsin.** 

**Welcome to my Being Well Learning Sessions, before we get started, I share what I expect from you and some suggested Learning tools should you decide to join any other sessions.**

 **Tools: 📝🧠🚰🍵✨** 

* **Pen, paper**
* **Water, coffee caffeine- many and multiple beverages of your choice**
* **Critical thinking mindset**
* **Positive attitude**

**Please keep in mind that not all of these materials might be necessary for you as a learner, but I like to level set at the jump/start of my sessions to make sure everyone feels set up for success. I also thank you in advance as I learn to being ON camera, usually I am safe and sound behind the screens so there is definitely a learning curve here for me. 🎥📹👁️** 

**Let us begin.** 

**🔹 🪿✨🧠✅— My Intentions** 

**I am here to share everything that I have learned and am learning on my -what I like to refer to as- my Era of Becoming. ✨🧠💪🪿** **I am becoming the best version of myself, every day, over and over and I’d like to share with you the tools that I have found that work for me living with adhd, trauma, cptsd, and perimenopause--with emphasis on cannabis so we can change that outdated conversation and those old mindsets-time to get with the times! Not high times anymore! Well times!** 

**🔹 🪿✨🧠✅— My why**

 **Because a lot of us were never taught how to feel safe in our bodies. And bc I believe that knowledge is power and sharing is caring I want to be a space where we talk about and name it. 📝✅ Learning how my brain and body operate and the why behind my personality and behavior has set me free from myself, from my own mind trying to tell me I was broken or ‘doing it wrong’ 🪿🖤🧠💪✨** 

**🔹🪿✨🧠✅— Expect to Find**

 **As I continue to learn I want to share bc I believe we are placed here on in this timeline to help one another. I want to be a light in the dark for another, a light I didn’t have and a shining light example for my daughters. 👩‍👧🏽‍👧** **My Space and sessions are about facts, regulation and grounded conversations using our growth mindsets. Learning to be well, together.** 

**🔹🪿✨🧠✅— I cordially Invite you to frolic along with me**

 **And so, I tell you, you are welcome here with me, as you are. As is. Just so. I take you as you are, on purpose. I love you and there is room here for you with me.** **I hope you join me in my journey of learning to be well and to continuously create ourselves on the blank canvas of this life. to learn and contribute to changing the conversation not only around cannabis, but around ourselves and each other. 🤗🫂🌍** **I also want you to know that I am happy to say when I don’t know something and together we can find the answer/response. I ask that you stay present, be here now, and remain curious on the mood elevator. 🪜🧠🤓🪿✨🖤** 

**🔹🪿✨🧠✅— Until I see you again** 

**So! All that said!** **Until then, my sweet friends--I will see you next time and don’t forget--I love you. Make good choices, you do no harm but you take no sheet.**

 **(((Be well)))** 

**I am going to close the training session at this time.** 

**🌬️🪿✨🖤** **Celeste**

1q02blb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moonjewelry/comments/1q02blb/what_type_of_jewelry_is_best_to_use_daily/,What type of jewelry is best to use daily?,"Honestly, the best jewelry for daily wear is the kind you **don’t have to think about**. Something you can throw on in the morning, live your life in, and still feel put together.

For everyday use, **gold-plated and stainless steel jewelry** are absolute lifesavers.

Gold-plated pieces are great when you want that soft, elegant look without wearing real gold every single day. They make even a simple outfit feel a little more feminine and polished. As long as you’re not showering or swimming in them all the time, they hold up really well for day-to-day wear.

Stainless steel is perfect if you’re busy (which most of us are). It doesn’t tarnish easily, it’s durable, and you don’t have to baby it. Think simple hoops, small studs, dainty chains — the kind of pieces you can wear to work, errands, coffee runs, everything.

My personal rule: **stainless steel for everyday basics, gold-plated for when you want that extra glow**.

If you’re looking for cute, wearable pieces that actually make sense for daily life, I’ve come across [**Moonjewelry.ca**](http://Moonjewelry.ca) — they have a nice mix of gold-plated and stainless steel jewelry that’s very “everyday girl” friendly.

1q0292f,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q0292f/i_wrote_my_new_years_resolutions_on_an_anonymous/,"I wrote my New Year's resolutions on an anonymous website. Item 3 was ""lose 15kg""","The loneliness of December 31st has a very specific feeling.

My name is Kaique. I’m 32 years old, I work in tech support for a logistics company that will probably be replaced by AI in the next quarter, and I’ve been single long enough for my relatives to stop asking ""any girlfriends yet?"" and start asking ""how is your health?"".

I was sitting on the couch in my tiny downtown apartment, listening to the premature fireworks going off outside. The TV was on the New Year’s Eve special, that show of forced optimism where sweaty singers pretend the coming year will be magical.

I hated it. I hated their hope.

My laptop was in front of me. I was browsing the internet aimlessly when it appeared. It wasn’t an intrusive ad. It was a link on an obscure productivity forum I frequented (ironically, since I was procrastinating my entire life).

The link just said: **THE JANUARY MANIFESTO: Become who you were born to be.**

I clicked. The design was minimalist, almost brutalist. Black background, white font. No ads, no photos of smiling people doing yoga, no promises of ""get rich quick.""

There was only a text field numbered 1 to 5 and a button: **SIGN CONTRACT.**

At the top, a phrase read: *""Change hurts. Permanence kills. What are you willing to sacrifice for the New You?""*

I was drunk enough to find it poetic and desperate enough to take it seriously. I looked at my belly bulging over my belt. I looked at my nails bitten down to the quick, a nervous habit I’d carried since childhood. I remembered my ex, Marina, saying I was ""too emotionally closed off"" before slamming the door.

I decided this year would be different. Not just in theory. I was going to change.

I started typing. My wishes for the new year. A sincere and simple list.

1. **I want to stop biting my nails for good.** (A classic).
2. **I want a smile that forces people to look at me.** (My teeth were yellowed and I smiled with my mouth closed, so having a nice smile was essential for my self-esteem).
3. **I want to lose 15 kilos fast.** (I didn't have the patience for the gym).
4. **I want to have an open heart to the world.** (After all, my ex's criticism still hurt my ego).
5. **I want to kill the old, failed Kaique forever.**

I read the list. It looked like a war plan.

I clicked **SIGN CONTRACT.**

The screen flickered. It didn't ask for an email, it didn't ask for a credit card, it didn't ask for confirmation. Just a message appeared for two seconds before the site went offline and gave a 404 error:

*""The Protocol has been initiated. Happy New Year.""*

I closed the laptop, laughed at my own stupidity for thinking a website would work miracles, finished the bottle of sparkling wine, and passed out on the couch before the countdown.

# January 1st

I woke up with a dry mouth and a pounding headache. The midday sun was coming through the cracks in the blinds, hurting my eyes. I got up, dizzy, and went to the kitchen to drink water.

As I held the glass, I felt something strange. The texture of the glass felt... crooked against my fingertips.

I looked at my hand.

I screamed and dropped the glass, which shattered on the floor, scattering shards and water everywhere.

My nails. They weren't there.

I don't mean they were cut short. I mean... they were gone. Where the keratin plate should have been, there was only skin. Smooth, continuous, pink skin covering the tips of my fingers as if I were a plastic doll or a developing fetus that hadn't grown nails yet.

I brought my hand to my mouth, horrified. The sensation of my tongue passing over the ""blind"" fingertips was nauseating. There were no edges. There was nothing to bite.

I ran to the bathroom. I looked at my feet. The same thing. My toes were smooth, disturbing sausages.

""What the hell is this?"" I whispered to the mirror.

My heart raced. I tried to rationalize. An allergic reaction? A bizarre side effect of some sudden vitamin deficiency? Fungus? But there was no pain. There was no blood. The skin was perfectly healed, as if I had been born that way.

I remembered the list.

**Item 1: I want to stop biting my nails for good.**

Well... technically, it was impossible to bite what didn't exist.

I grabbed my phone to call emergency services. But I stopped. What would I say? ""Hello, my nails disappeared""? They would laugh at me. Or institutionalize me.

I decided to wait. Maybe it was a lucid dream caused by cheap alcohol. I spent the rest of the day wearing gloves, avoiding looking at my hands. The tactile sensation of picking up objects without the rigidity of the nail was agonizing—too soft, too vulnerable.

# January 2nd

I woke up feeling strangely light. Not light in spirit. Light in gravity.

I sat up in bed and, when I went to put my feet on the floor to stand up, I lost my balance and fell shoulder-first onto the carpet. My left leg didn't respond.

I looked down, expecting to see my tangled pajamas. The pajamas were there, but they were empty from the knee down.

The panic was so absolute that my vision went dark. I groped my leg. My left thigh was there. The knee was there. But just below the patella, the leg ended.

There was no blood. There was no open wound. The skin closed into a perfect, rounded, smooth stump, like the end of a sausage cut and healed years ago.

""No, no, no..."" I moaned, dragging myself backward until my back hit the wall.

I pulled up the pant leg of my right leg. A huge chunk of my calf was missing. As if someone had used a giant ice cream scoop and ""dug"" out the meat, leaving only the tibia and fibula bones covered by thin, translucent skin.

I touched my torso. A piece of my back was missing; I could feel the hole. Flesh was missing from my right arm.

I crawled to the bathroom, crying, and weighed myself, supporting myself on the sink. The digital display of the scale blinked.

**70.5 kg.**

Two days ago, I weighed 85.5 kg. I had lost exactly 15 kilos.

**Item 3: I want to lose 15 kilos fast.**

I vomited in the sink. This wasn't a diet. I was being sculpted. Someone—or something—was taking pieces of me to meet the goal. Flesh, fat, bone, muscle... subtracted magically during sleep, cauterized by an invisible force.

I tried to call the police. I dialed 190. The call didn't go through. A synthetic voice spoke in my ear:

*""The contract cannot be interrupted during the processing phase. Please wait for completion.""*

I threw the phone against the mirror, cracking the glass. I was trapped. Trapped in my apartment, trapped in my diminishing body.

I spent the day on the living room floor, a kitchen knife in my hand, waiting for someone to enter. No one entered. The horror was coming from within.

# January 3rd

I didn't sleep. I stayed awake, watching my own body, waiting to see a piece disappear. But sleep overcame me around 4:00 AM.

When I woke up at 9:00 AM, my mouth hurt. A sharp pain in my cheeks and jaw. I tasted copper.

I ran to the cracked bathroom mirror, limping on my single leg. I screamed, but the scream came out gurgled.

My cheeks... had they been torn? No. They had been remodeled. The skin at the corners of my mouth had been pulled back and fused near my ears. My lips were stretched in unbearable tension, exposing all my gums.

I was smiling.

A wide, fixed, maniacal smile, Joker-style, but without the crude scars. It was anatomically impossible, but there it was.

And the teeth. My yellowed, crooked teeth had fallen out (I saw some in the sink drain). In their place, new teeth were growing. White. White as sanitary porcelain. And big.

They were perfect, yes, but they were too big for my mouth. They were predator teeth, teeth made to be seen from miles away. They gleamed under the bathroom light.

**Item 2: I want a smile that forces people to look at me.**

I tried to close my mouth. I couldn't. The lips were too short now. My teeth would be exposed forever. The air dried my gums, causing excruciating pain. I looked like a monster from a bad movie. A one-legged, laughing demon.

I cried in front of the mirror, but the smile didn't fade. I was sobbing, my eyes swollen with dread, but my mouth remained in that mix of eternal, white happiness. The dissonance between what I felt and what I showed was maddening.

I started searching my browser history. I needed to find the site. I needed to cancel. But the history was clean.

I tried to text my sister, asking for help. When I typed ""Help, I need help,"" the letters on the screen changed on their own to: *""I'm great! The process is wonderful!""*

The ""Contract"" controlled my data output. It wouldn't let me spoil the surprise. I was isolated. A prisoner in a tower of flesh.

# January 4th

The pain in my chest woke me before sunrise. It wasn't heartburn. It wasn't a heart attack. It was a cutting pain. Cold and precise.

I looked down. My shirt was open. The buttons had popped off. In the center of my chest, over the sternum, the skin was becoming... transparent. No, not transparent. It was opening.

Like the petals of a grotesque flower, the skin and pectoral muscle were slowly retracting to the sides, curling in on themselves. I wasn't bleeding. The edges of the wound were clean, shiny, and moist.

The sternum bone cracked and split in half. The ribs pulled apart with a wet cracking sound, like green branches being bent.

I screamed, writhing in bed, clutching the sheets with my nailless hands. The smile on my face remained fixed, mocking my agony.

I could see my lungs inflating and deflating. They were pink and gray. And in the middle of them, beating frantically, was my heart.

The tissue around the heart began to dissolve. The organ was exposed. Naked. Vulnerable to the room's air. I could see the arteries, the blue veins, the yellow fat. I could see every terrified beat.

**Item 4: I want to have an open heart to the world.**

The literal interpretation was of artistic cruelty.

I felt the cold air touch the surface of my heart. Every beat hurt, scraping against the open edges of my ribcage. Any dust, any bacteria, any touch there would be fatal. I was a living anatomical doll.

I dragged myself to the cleanest corner of the room. I grabbed rolls of plastic wrap I used for leftovers and wrapped my own torso, crying as the plastic stuck to the exposed flesh and bone. I needed to protect myself. I was too ""open.""

I sat in the dark, listening to the wet sound of my heart beating against the plastic.

There was one item left. The list had five items.

I looked at the clock. It was 11:50 PM. Day 5 was coming.

**Item 5: I want to kill the old, failed Kaique forever.**

The dread I felt in the previous days was nothing compared to the ice that flooded my veins in that moment. The other items were modifications. Tortures, yes, but modifications. The fifth item was a death sentence.

""Kill the old Kaique.""

I grabbed the kitchen knife I kept by my side. If anyone came to kill me, I would take them with me. I dragged myself to the front door, the only access point.

I stayed there, with my giant smile, my heart exposed under the plastic, my missing leg, my smooth hands clutching the knife handle.

I waited.

Midnight.

Nothing happened.

1:00 AM.

Nothing.

3:00 AM.

I ended up falling asleep from exhaustion, leaning against the door, praying the nightmare was over, that the literal interpretation had been ""metaphorical"" this time.

# January 5th

I woke up to the sound of a key turning in the lock.

The sound came from behind my head. I was leaning against the door. The key was being inserted from the outside.

My blood ran cold. I live alone. Only I have the key. The copy is with my mother, who lives in another city.

I pulled away, dragging my mutilated body across the floor, pointing the knife.

The doorknob turned. The door opened softly. The hallway light flooded in, creating a silhouette.

A man entered.

He wore a gray suit, impeccable, tailored. Italian leather shoes. He closed the door gently behind him and turned to me.

The knife slipped from my smooth hand and fell to the floor with a metallic clang.

The man was me.

But not me.

He had my face, but improved. The skin was glowing, healthy, tanned. He was thin—15 kilos thinner than my old self, but proportionally, athletically. He smiled at me. The smile was wide, confident, with perfect white teeth that actually fit in his mouth. A magnetic smile.

He looked at my hands on the floor. His hands had perfect, well-groomed nails. He placed a hand on his chest. I knew, instinctively, that his heart was protected by strong bones, but that he was emotionally charismatic, ""open"" in a figurative way.

He was the New Kaique. Version 2.0. The final result.

And me? I looked at my shredded body on the floor.

I wasn't the client. I was the raw material. I was the cocoon. I was the bio-waste left over after the butterfly emerges. The ""old, failed Kaique.""

The New Kaique walked up to me. He didn't seem disgusted. He had a look of pity, like someone looking at a dog run over by a car that needs to be put down.

""You were very brave,"" he said. His voice was mine, but without the stutter, without the insecurity—projected and firm. ""Thank you for the sacrifice. I'll take it from here.""

""Who... are... you?"" I gurgled through my stretched smile.

""I am what you asked for. I am the Resolution.""

He crouched down. From his suit pocket, he didn't pull a gun. He pulled a black trash bag, thick, industrial. And a roll of duct tape.

""The contract was clear, Kaique. For the new to be born, the old must die. Coexistence does not exist."" ""It's a server space conflict in reality.""

He lunged.

I tried to fight. I tried to scratch him with my nailless fingers, tried to bite with my oversized teeth. But I was weak. Missing pieces. My heart exposed.

He was strong. He pinned me easily. I felt his hands—my hands, but strong—close around my neck. It wasn't a strangulation of anger. It was a shutdown.

As my vision faded, the last thing I saw was my own face, perfect and beautiful, smiling at me while he killed me.

I woke up.

I heard the alarm clock ring. 7:00 AM. I sat up in bed. I took a deep breath. My lungs filled with air without pain. My chest was closed. My legs were there.

I ran to the mirror. I was thin. 70kg, defined muscles. I opened my mouth. Perfect, white, aligned teeth. I looked at my hands. Impeccable nails.

I felt an inner peace, a confidence I never had in my life. An ""open heart.""

I did it. It worked. I am the Kaique I always dreamed of being.

I put on my new suit. I have a job interview today, and I know I'll get it. I have a date with Marina later; I called her and my voice was so charming she agreed to see me.

I walked to the kitchen to make coffee. I opened the cabinet under the sink to get a new filter.

Deep in the back, behind the cleaning products, was a black trash bag, large and heavy, wrapped in duct tape.

It smelled like meat starting to turn.

I stopped for a second. I looked at the bag.

I felt a pang of... memory? An echo of pain in my chest? A ghost of a torn smile?

No. Must be my imagination. The old Kaique was full of paranoia. I'm not like that.

I closed the cabinet door.

I grabbed my coffee, gave my best smile to the hallway mirror, and went out to conquer my New Year.

After all, today is trash pickup day. I’ll take the bag when I go down.

I decided this year would be different. Not just in theory. I was going to change.

I started typing. My wishes for the new year. A sincere and simple list.

1. **I want to stop biting my nails for good.** (A classic).
2. **I want a smile that forces people to look at me.** (My teeth were yellowed and I smiled with my mouth closed, so having a nice smile was essential for my self-esteem).
3. **I want to lose 15 kilos fast.** (I didn't have the patience for the gym).
4. **I want to have an open heart to the world.** (After all, my ex's criticism still hurt my ego).

I read the list. It looked like a war plan.

I closed the laptop, laughed at my own stupidity for thinking a website would work miracles, finished the bottle of sparkling wine, and passed out on the couch before the countdown.

# January 1st

I woke up with a dry mouth and a pounding headache. The midday sun was coming through the cracks in the blinds, hurting my eyes. I got up, dizzy, and went to the kitchen to drink water.

As I held the glass, I felt something strange. The texture of the glass felt... crooked against my fingertips.

I looked at my hand.

I screamed and dropped the glass, which shattered on the floor, scattering shards and water everywhere.

My nails. They weren't there.

I don't mean they were cut short. I mean... they were gone. Where the keratin plate should have been, there was only skin. Smooth, continuous, pink skin covering the tips of my fingers as if I were a plastic doll or a developing fetus that hadn't grown nails yet.

I brought my hand to my mouth, horrified. The sensation of my tongue passing over the ""blind"" fingertips was nauseating. There were no edges. There was nothing to bite.

I ran to the bathroom. I looked at my feet. The same thing. My toes were smooth, disturbing sausages.

""What the hell is this?"" I whispered to the mirror.

My heart raced. I tried to rationalize. An allergic reaction? A bizarre side effect of some sudden vitamin deficiency? Fungus? But there was no pain. There was no blood. The skin was perfectly healed, as if I had been born that way.

I remembered the list.

**Item 1: I want to stop biting my nails for good.**

Well... technically, it was impossible to bite what didn't exist.

I grabbed my phone to call emergency services. But I stopped. What would I say? ""Hello, my nails disappeared""? They would laugh at me. Or institutionalize me.

I decided to wait. Maybe it was a lucid dream caused by cheap alcohol. I spent the rest of the day wearing gloves, avoiding looking at my hands. The tactile sensation of picking up objects without the rigidity of the nail was agonizing—too soft, too vulnerable.

# January 2nd

I woke up feeling strangely light. Not light in spirit. Light in gravity.

I sat up in bed and, when I went to put my feet on the floor to stand up, I lost my balance and fell shoulder-first onto the carpet. My left leg didn't respond.

I looked down, expecting to see my tangled pajamas. The pajamas were there, but they were empty from the knee down.

The panic was so absolute that my vision went dark. I groped my leg. My left thigh was there. The knee was there. But just below the patella, the leg ended.

There was no blood. There was no open wound. The skin closed into a perfect, rounded, smooth stump, like the end of a sausage cut and healed years ago.

""No, no, no..."" I moaned, dragging myself backward until my back hit the wall.

I pulled up the pant leg of my right leg. A huge chunk of my calf was missing. As if someone had used a giant ice cream scoop and ""dug"" out the meat, leaving only the tibia and fibula bones covered by thin, translucent skin.

I touched my torso. A piece of my back was missing; I could feel the hole. Flesh was missing from my right arm.

I crawled to the bathroom, crying, and weighed myself, supporting myself on the sink. The digital display of the scale blinked.

**70.5 kg.**

Two days ago, I weighed 85.5 kg. I had lost exactly 15 kilos.

**Item 3: I want to lose 15 kilos fast.**

I vomited in the sink. This wasn't a diet. I was being sculpted. Someone—or something—was taking pieces of me to meet the goal. Flesh, fat, bone, muscle... subtracted magically during sleep, cauterized by an invisible force.

I tried to call the police. I dialed 190. The call didn't go through. A synthetic voice spoke in my ear:

*""The contract cannot be interrupted during the processing phase. Please wait for completion.""*

I threw the phone against the mirror, cracking the glass. I was trapped. Trapped in my apartment, trapped in my diminishing body.

I spent the day on the living room floor, a kitchen knife in my hand, waiting for someone to enter. No one entered. The horror was coming from within.

# January 3rd

I didn't sleep. I stayed awake, watching my own body, waiting to see a piece disappear. But sleep overcame me around 4:00 AM.

When I woke up at 9:00 AM, my mouth hurt. A sharp pain in my cheeks and jaw. I tasted copper.

I ran to the cracked bathroom mirror, limping on my single leg. I screamed, but the scream came out gurgled.

My cheeks... had they been torn? No. They had been remodeled. The skin at the corners of my mouth had been pulled back and fused near my ears. My lips were stretched in unbearable tension, exposing all my gums.

I was smiling.

A wide, fixed, maniacal smile, Joker-style, but without the crude scars. It was anatomically impossible, but there it was.

And the teeth. My yellowed, crooked teeth had fallen out (I saw some in the sink drain). In their place, new teeth were growing. White. White as sanitary porcelain. And big.

They were perfect, yes, but they were too big for my mouth. They were predator teeth, teeth made to be seen from miles away. They gleamed under the bathroom light.

**Item 2: I want a smile that forces people to look at me.**

I tried to close my mouth. I couldn't. The lips were too short now. My teeth would be exposed forever. The air dried my gums, causing excruciating pain. I looked like a monster from a bad movie. A one-legged, laughing demon.

I cried in front of the mirror, but the smile didn't fade. I was sobbing, my eyes swollen with dread, but my mouth remained in that mix of eternal, white happiness. The dissonance between what I felt and what I showed was maddening.

I started searching my browser history. I needed to find the site. I needed to cancel. But the history was clean.

I tried to text my sister, asking for help. When I typed ""Help, I need help,"" the letters on the screen changed on their own to: *""I'm great! The process is wonderful!""*

The ""Contract"" controlled my data output. It wouldn't let me spoil the surprise. I was isolated. A prisoner in a tower of flesh.

# January 4th

The pain in my chest woke me before sunrise. It wasn't heartburn. It wasn't a heart attack. It was a cutting pain. Cold and precise.

I looked down. My shirt was open. The buttons had popped off. In the center of my chest, over the sternum, the skin was becoming... transparent. No, not transparent. It was opening.

Like the petals of a grotesque flower, the skin and pectoral muscle were slowly retracting to the sides, curling in on themselves. I wasn't bleeding. The edges of the wound were clean, shiny, and moist.

The sternum bone cracked and split in half. The ribs pulled apart with a wet cracking sound, like green branches being bent.

I screamed, writhing in bed, clutching the sheets with my nailless hands. The smile on my face remained fixed, mocking my agony.

I could see my lungs inflating and deflating. They were pink and gray. And in the middle of them, beating frantically, was my heart.

The tissue around the heart began to dissolve. The organ was exposed. Naked. Vulnerable to the room's air. I could see the arteries, the blue veins, the yellow fat. I could see every terrified beat.

**Item 4: I want to have an open heart to the world.**

The literal interpretation was of artistic cruelty.

I felt the cold air touch the surface of my heart. Every beat hurt, scraping against the open edges of my ribcage. Any dust, any bacteria, any touch there would be fatal. I was a living anatomical doll.

I dragged myself to the cleanest corner of the room. I grabbed rolls of plastic wrap I used for leftovers and wrapped my own torso, crying as the plastic stuck to the exposed flesh and bone. I needed to protect myself. I was too ""open.""

I sat in the dark, listening to the wet sound of my heart beating against the plastic.

There was one item left. The list had five items.

I looked at the clock. It was 11:50 PM. Day 5 was coming.

**Item 5: I want to kill the old, failed Kaique forever.**

The dread I felt in the previous days was nothing compared to the ice that flooded my veins in that moment. The other items were modifications. Tortures, yes, but modifications. The fifth item was a death sentence.

""Kill the old Kaique.""

I grabbed the kitchen knife I kept by my side. If anyone came to kill me, I would take them with me. I dragged myself to the front door, the only access point.

I stayed there, with my giant smile, my heart exposed under the plastic, my missing leg, my smooth hands clutching the knife handle.

I waited.

Midnight.

Nothing happened.

1:00 AM.

Nothing.

3:00 AM.

I ended up falling asleep from exhaustion, leaning against the door, praying the nightmare was over, that the literal interpretation had been ""metaphorical"" this time.

# January 5th

I woke up to the sound of a key turning in the lock.

The sound came from behind my head. I was leaning against the door. The key was being inserted from the outside.

My blood ran cold. I live alone. Only I have the key. The copy is with my mother, who lives in another city.

I pulled away, dragging my mutilated body across the floor, pointing the knife.

The doorknob turned. The door opened softly. The hallway light flooded in, creating a silhouette.

A man entered.

He wore a gray suit, impeccable, tailored. Italian leather shoes. He closed the door gently behind him and turned to me.

The knife slipped from my smooth hand and fell to the floor with a metallic clang.

The man was me.

But not me.

He had my face, but improved. The skin was glowing, healthy, tanned. He was thin—15 kilos thinner than my old self, but proportionally, athletically. He smiled at me. The smile was wide, confident, with perfect white teeth that actually fit in his mouth. A magnetic smile.

He looked at my hands on the floor. His hands had perfect, well-groomed nails. He placed a hand on his chest. I knew, instinctively, that his heart was protected by strong bones, but that he was emotionally charismatic, ""open"" in a figurative way.

He was the New Kaique. Version 2.0. The final result.

And me? I looked at my shredded body on the floor.

I wasn't the client. I was the raw material. I was the cocoon. I was the bio-waste left over after the butterfly emerges. The ""old, failed Kaique.""

The New Kaique walked up to me. He didn't seem disgusted. He had a look of pity, like someone looking at a dog run over by a car that needs to be put down.

""You were very brave,"" he said. His voice was mine, but without the stutter, without the insecurity—projected and firm. ""Thank you for the sacrifice. I'll take it from here.""

""Who... are... you?"" I gurgled through my stretched smile.

""I am what you asked for. I am the Resolution.""

He crouched down. From his suit pocket, he didn't pull a gun. He pulled a black trash bag, thick, industrial. And a roll of duct tape.

""The contract was clear, Kaique. For the new to be born, the old must die. Coexistence does not exist."" ""It's a server space conflict in reality.""

He lunged.

I tried to fight. I tried to scratch him with my nailless fingers, tried to bite with my oversized teeth. But I was weak. Missing pieces. My heart exposed.

He was strong. He pinned me easily. I felt his hands—my hands, but strong—close around my neck. It wasn't a strangulation of anger. It was a shutdown.

As my vision faded, the last thing I saw was my own face, perfect and beautiful, smiling at me while he killed me.

I woke up.

I heard the alarm clock ring. 7:00 AM. I sat up in bed. I took a deep breath. My lungs filled with air without pain. My chest was closed. My legs were there.

I felt an inner peace, a confidence I never had in my life. An ""open heart.""

I did it. It worked. I am the Kaique I always dreamed of being.

I put on my new suit. I have a job interview today, and I know I'll get it. I have a date with Marina later; I called her and my voice was so charming she agreed to see me.

I walked to the kitchen to make coffee. I opened the cabinet under the sink to get a new filter.

Deep in the back, behind the cleaning products, was a black trash bag, large and heavy, wrapped in duct tape.

It smelled like meat starting to turn.

I stopped for a second. I looked at the bag.

I felt a pang of... memory? An echo of pain in my chest? A ghost of a torn smile?

No. Must be my imagination. The old Kaique was full of paranoia. I'm not like that.

I closed the cabinet door.

I grabbed my coffee, gave my best smile to the hallway mirror, and went out to conquer my New Year.

After all, today is trash pickup day. I’ll take the bag when I go down.

Hi, I am 18 years old and have been with my girlfriend for 4 years now. She's the best thing to have ever happened to me, but recently, she's been really distant. 

Ever since nag ka part-time job sya, nagiging inconsistent na updates nya, to almost no updates at all. She works at a coffee stand, owned by her tita. She would deliver and take orders from people. Her shift also starts at 8am until 11pm, and she usually gets home around 12PM. At first, I was okay with it, I tried my best to understand and be patient. But as time goes on, mas nagiging distant sya and hindi nya nako ma update. 

And this has been going on for 1 month now (this started in December), sobrang dry and cold ng convo namen dahil hindi na sya makapag update and hindi nya na rin ako nakakausap. She wasn't like this, back then, she would always find ways to update me, to talk to me, to spend time with me. I don't know if I'm just being OA or something, but I can't help but overthink, a lot. Halos hindi naren kame nag uusap masyado because of her part-time. 

Dumating yung birthday ko, it was December 25. She greeted me, and we talked, but only for a bit. The whole day, she was out with her family, and that's okay with me. But nung makauwi na sila, it was 11pm na by then, she couldn't even ask me about how my day went, she was cold and uninterested. She couldn't show that she cares, she's just so distant. I didn't get any ""How are you?"" ""How was your birthday?"" She just told me that she's tired and she's going to rest then. She couldn't make time for me, even for a bit, since it's my birthday. 

I've been trying to reach out to her, telling her that I am not okay with our situation and that I can't endure this anymore. She's been really dry and distant for a whole month and she can't update me at all. But all she could say to me was ""I am sorry, once I'm done with my part-time job, everything will be okay"" (She ends her part-time job after the new year), and I can't do anything but just accept it. 

I don't know what to do anymore and honestly, it's been really hard on my side. I've been trying to be as understanding as I can and patient, but I can't help but feel that she's uninterested in me anymore. It's my first time posting in this type of stuff, so if I'm missing some parts in the story, feel free to ask. ",2,1767150591.0,OALangBaAko,1,1.0,False
1q026cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1q026cu/my_killer_attended_my_funeral/,My Killer Attended My Funeral,"I’m not really sure how to start this without sounding dramatic, so I’ll just say it plainly: I didn’t know I was being stalked. Not even a little. If you’d asked me a week before I died, I would’ve told you my life was boring in the safest way possible.

I had routines. Everyone does. Same bus, same seat if it was open. Same coffee place because the girl there remembered my name and spelled it right. Same walk home, same shortcut past the closed laundromat even though it smelled weird. I liked knowing where I’d be at any given time. It made me feel solid. Real.

That’s important later.

The first weird thing wasn’t fear. It was absence. Little gaps. I’d swear I locked my door, then find it unlocked. I’d get home and feel like someone had just left, the air still warm, but nothing moved. I told myself it was stress. Everyone does that too. You normalize until there’s nothing left to normalize.

Sometimes I thought I saw the same person more than once in a day. On the bus. Across the street. Reflected in glass. But cities recycle faces. That’s what I told myself. That’s what you tell yourself when the alternative is admitting you might be seen.

The night it happened was stupidly normal. I remember being annoyed about carrying groceries. I remember thinking I should text my sister back. I remember dropping my keys and bending down to grab them.

I didn’t hear him approach.

That part bothers people when they hear it, but it’s the truth. There was no dramatic moment where I sensed danger. No intuition. One second I was alone, the next I wasn’t.

Pain didn’t come all at once. It came in pieces. Confusion first. A pressure that didn’t make sense. The sound I made when I tried to scream didn’t sound human to me, even as it was coming out of my own mouth.

I saw his face for a moment. Not clearly. But I remember thinking how calm he looked. Not angry. Not excited. Focused. Like this was a task he’d already finished in his head.

When the knife went in, it wasn’t like the movies. It wasn’t fast. It was clumsy and wet and wrong. I remember the warmth spreading, soaking through my clothes, my body trying to reject what was happening and failing at it.

The worst part wasn’t the pain.

It was realizing I didn’t matter.

Not in the way I thought I did. This wasn’t personal. I wasn’t chosen because of something I did or said. I was just… available. A space he decided to empty.

I remember choking on my own breath. I remember the taste of blood, metallic and thick. I remember his hand over my mouth, firm but not frantic, holding me still like you’d hold something fragile you didn’t want to break too early.

And then things started slipping.

Not black. Not nothing. Just distance.

I was still there, but not inside myself anymore. I watched him clean up. I watched him wash his hands like he was getting ready for bed. He was careful. Respectful, almost. That’s the word I hate the most.

When he left, he paused in the doorway and looked back at what was left of me. I felt… owned. Like a project he’d finally completed.

After that, time stopped behaving. I followed things instead of experiencing them. My body being found. My name being said in hushed voices. My life being summarized badly by people who loved me but never really knew how to explain me.

The funeral came faster than it should have. Everything does when you’re the one being buried.

The room was wrong. Too bright. Too neutral. My picture on a stand like it was proof I’d existed instead of evidence I was gone. People cried. People hugged. People said the same phrases over and over like repetition might build a bridge back to me.

Then he walked in.

I knew him immediately. Even though I’d barely seen him alive. Recognition doesn’t need details.

He sat where he could see everything. He dressed appropriately. He looked… invested. When people talked about me, he listened harder than anyone else in the room.

When they laughed at a story about me, his mouth twitched. When they got something wrong, I felt this cold satisfaction radiating off him. Like he knew me better now.

He came up to the casket last.

He stood close. Too close. And he whispered, “I’m sorry.”

He didn’t mean it like regret. He meant it like closure.

That’s when it hit me: I was more real to him dead than I ever was alive. My absence had weight. My ending gave me shape. He took something unfinished and made it complete.

And then he left.

He didn’t look back.

I started fading after that. Not all at once. Slowly. Every time someone stopped saying my name. Every time my room got cleaned out. Every time my life got reduced to a memory instead of an active thing.

I’m not haunting him. I don’t follow him. I don’t get justice.

I just disappear.

So if this makes you uncomfortable, good. It should. Because there was nothing special about me. No warning signs. No destiny. Just routines. Just predictability. Just someone deciding the world wouldn’t miss me as much as it did.

And he was right.

The scariest part isn’t that my killer got away with it.

It’s how easily the world agreed.",2,1767150579.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I’ve only ever seen this man cry one other time, and it was during the birth of our first living baby. The second time was today. We got that mug at the beginning of our relationship; one for him and one for me.

I’m looking for someone, anyone (a business, a pottery studio, literally anyone) who can glue ceramic mug pieces back together professionally or semi-professionally. They’re larger pieces and aside from a few super small shards that I couldn’t safely collect, I was able to save the rest.

I realize this is a long shot for a request, but any help or recommendations you have will be greatly appreciated.

If all else fails, I’ll do my best to superglue it back together. I just don’t have anything to compress it with, which is why I’m asking here first.

Edit: I’d like to say that I understand this is a first world problem. I don’t know why I feel the need to say this, but I do. There are people really struggling and I’m asking about a coffee mug.

1q0247f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0247f,Before and after center console wireless charging mat and cupholder protection inserts,"Same products people already posted links to, but here's the [wireless charging mat](https://a.co/d/g3NsJb2) and the [cupholder insert](https://a.co/d/2ONnswM). I got nervous after seeing a couple of spilled liquid posts, then I almost dumped a cup of coffee in mine. Thankfully just a few drops here and there.

I'm not concerned with the mat affecting wireless charging as I no longer wirelessly charge. For my personal phone I decided the potential heat damage to the battery wasn't worth the convenience. My work phone has a case that interferes with the Santa Fe's wireless charging. This is the first car I've had with wireless charging, so I still have the muscle memory of plugging in a phone when I want to charge. I have two short cables I leave plugged in.

I do drink water throughout the day, but I really want a mug to drink hot coffees (lattes, milk based coffees) out of, as well as iced. The 40oz is a little huge to decant a coffee into for the sizes I drink.

I wanted to grab another one and the same design as I love LoveShack Fancy, but the 20oz comes with the sippy straw lid. Obviously not appropriate and I wouldn’t want to get milky coffee in that style of straw, even if heat wasn’t an issue.

My big quencher I have has an opening for a more conventional travel coffee mug sipping experience. Is it the same size for both the 20oz and the 40oz? Could I just swap the lids around?

1q01zrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PayForResultsSEO/comments/1q01zrc/why_eeat_isnt_optional_anymore_the_new_seo/,Why EEAT Isn’t Optional Anymore: The New SEO Standard,"For years, search engine optimization (SEO) felt a bit like a game of cat and mouse. Marketers would find a loophole, exploit it, and rank high. Then, Google would release an update, patch the hole, and everyone would scramble to find the next trick. But the era of gaming the system is effectively over. The algorithm has matured, and it now prioritizes one thing above all else: credibility.

This shift has brought the concept of EEAT—Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness—to the forefront of digital strategy. It is no longer a ""nice-to-have"" bonus for premium brands. In an internet flooded with AI-generated text and misinformation, Google EEAT has become the primary filter for quality.

If you want your content to rank, and more importantly, stay ranked, you have to prove you deserve to be there. It is not enough to just have the right keywords on the page anymore. You need to demonstrate that the people behind the content know what they are talking about.

# Decoding the Acronym: What Google EEAT Actually Means

To master **expertise authority trust SEO**, you first need to understand the distinct pillars that hold it up. Google’s Search Quality Rater Guidelines offer a deep dive into these concepts, but here is how they translate to practical web strategy.

# Experience (The Newcomer)

Google added the extra ""E"" for Experience fairly recently, and it changed the landscape significantly. This pillar asks: Does the content creator have first-hand experience with the topic?

If you are reviewing a hiking boot, have you actually worn it on a trail? If you are writing about a tax law, have you navigated that law yourself? Experience validates that the content isn't just a summary of other people's work. It adds a layer of authenticity that AI and content farms struggle to replicate.

# Expertise

While experience is about usage, expertise is about knowledge. This refers to the credentials and educational background of the author.

In medical or legal fields, this is non-negotiable. A blog post about managing diabetes needs to be written or reviewed by a medical professional to rank well. However, in other niches, ""everyday expertise"" counts. A hobbyist who has repaired vintage watches for 20 years has high expertise, even without a formal degree.

# Authoritativeness

This is about your reputation in the industry. Are you a go-to source? Do other experts cite your work?

Think of authoritativeness as your digital resume. If Wikipedia, major news outlets, and other industry leaders link to your site as a reference, your authority score goes up. It signals to Google that you aren't just shouting into the void—people are listening.

# Trustworthiness

Trust is the most important member of the family. In fact, Google’s guidelines state that Trustworthiness is the center of the concept. The other three pillars support it.

Trust is determined by the accuracy of your content, the security of your website (HTTPS), transparency about who owns the site, and how easily users can contact you. If Google cannot verify who you are or if your site feels like a scam, no amount of expertise will save your rankings.

# Why EEAT Matters More Now Than Ever

You might be wondering why this framework has suddenly become the buzzword of the industry. The answer lies in the explosion of content volume and the specific dangers of bad information.

# The Rise of Generative AI

Anyone can now generate a 2,000-word article on ""neuroscience"" in seconds using AI tools. While impressive, this content often lacks nuance, accuracy, and human insight. Google needs a way to distinguish between a generic, hallucinated AI article and a thoughtful piece written by a PhD. EEAT is that filter. It acts as a verification badge for human value.

# The YMYL Standard

The stakes are highest for websites categorized as ""Your Money or Your Life"" (YMYL). These are pages that could potentially impact a person’s future happiness, health, financial stability, or safety.

This includes:

* **News and current events**
* **Civics and law**
* **Finance (banking, taxes, investments)**
* **Health and safety**
* **Shopping (ecommerce)**

If your website falls into a YMYL category, **Google EEAT** signals are not just ranking factors; they are requirements. Google’s algorithms are incredibly strict here. A personal blog might get away with a casual opinion on the best pizza in New York, but offering advice on stock market investments requires a heavy dose of verifiable expertise.

# How EEAT Manifests in Real Content

You cannot log into Google Analytics and check your ""EEAT Score."" It doesn't exist as a single metric. Instead, the algorithm looks for a constellation of signals that suggest high quality.

# Author Credibility

The days of the ""Admin"" author tag are dead. High-EEAT content is attached to a real human being. This manifests as a detailed author byline that links to a bio page. That bio page should list credentials, past work, and links to social media profiles like LinkedIn. It connects the content to a verifiable identity.

# Content Depth and Nuance

Surface-level content rarely signals expertise. Articles that provide unique data, original research, or contrarian viewpoints based on experience stand out. Low-EEAT content often looks like a rewrite of the top three search results. High-EEAT content adds something new to the conversation.

# Radical Transparency

Trustworthy sites do not hide. They have clear ""About Us"" pages, physical addresses (where applicable), robust privacy policies, and easy-to-find contact information. If a user feels like they can't figure out who runs the website, trust evaporates.

# Consistency Across the Web

Google connects the dots. If your website claims you are a leading expert on sustainable architecture, but your LinkedIn profile says you are a part-time dog walker with no architectural experience, that discrepancy hurts your trust signals. Consistency between your on-page claims and your off-page footprint is vital.

# Evaluating SEO Trust Signals: How Google See You

Google uses a mix of direct and indirect signals to evaluate whether your site is trustworthy. Understanding these can help you reverse-engineer a better strategy.

# The Role of Backlinks

Backlinks have always been the currency of SEO, but in the context of EEAT, *who* links to you matters more than *how many* links you have.

A link from a government domain (.gov), an educational institution (.edu), or a recognized industry leader (like the New York Times or a major trade journal) acts as a vote of confidence. It tells Google, ""We trust this source."" Conversely, spammy links from low-quality directories can actually hurt your perceived authority.

# User Behavior Signals

If a user clicks your link, stays for ten seconds, and then hits the back button to try a different result, that is a negative trust signal. It suggests your content didn't answer their question or wasn't credible. High dwell time and engagement signal that users found your expertise valuable.

# Fact-Checking and Consensus

For YMYL topics, Google checks your content against the general consensus of experts. If you are a health site claiming that eating rocks is good for digestion, and the medical consensus says otherwise, your trustworthiness will tank. Alignment with established facts is a key component of **SEO trust signals**.

# Practical Ways to Improve Your EEAT

You don't need a PhD to improve your site's standing. Here are actionable steps to build a stronger foundation of trust without overengineering your site.

# 1. Audit Your ""About"" and ""Author"" Pages

This is the lowest-hanging fruit. Every site should have a comprehensive ""About"" page that explains the mission, the company history, and the people behind it.

For your authors, create dedicated bio pages. Do not just write ""John loves coffee."" Write ""John is a certified barista with 10 years of experience managing cafes in Seattle."" Link to his other articles and his social profiles. This creates a knowledge graph entity for your author that Google can understand.

# 2. Leverage Schema Markup

Schema markup is code that helps search engines understand your content better. Use `Person` schema for your authors and `Organization` schema for your business. This explicitly tells Google’s bots: ""This is the author, these are their credentials, and this is the publisher."" It removes the guesswork for the algorithm.

# 3. Show Your Work (Citations)

When you make a claim, back it up. Link to primary sources, studies, and data. If you are writing about finance, link to the SEC or relevant financial reports. External linking to high-authority sites doesn't bleed your ""link juice""—it shows you have done your research. It associates your content with the authoritative neighborhood of the internet.

# 4. Humanize Your Reviews

If you review products, prove you used them. Include original photos of the product in your hands (not just stock photos). Describe the sensory details—the weight, the texture, the setup process. These unique, experiential details are gold for the ""Experience"" part of EEAT.

# 5. Update Content Regularly

Information decay destroys trust. A medical article from 2018 is likely outdated. A ""Best Laptops"" guide from 2021 is useless today. Regularly auditing and updating your content shows Google that you are maintaining your library and that your information is current.

# 6. Manage Your Off-Page Reputation

Pay attention to what people say about you elsewhere. Encourage happy customers to leave reviews on Google Business Profile, Trustpilot, or industry-specific directories. Respond to negative reviews professionally. Google reads these. A brand with a 1.5-star rating across the web will struggle to rank for competitive terms, regardless of how good their blog posts are.

# The Long-Term Value of Credibility

Implementing a robust EEAT strategy is not a quick fix. You will not see your traffic double overnight because you updated an author bio. It is a long-term play for stability.

Websites that ignore these signals are building on sand. They might rank for a while, but they are one algorithm update away from disappearing. By investing in **expertise authority trust SEO**, you are building on bedrock. You are insulating your site against future updates because you are giving Google exactly what it wants: a safe, reliable, and helpful experience for the user.

As search engines continue to evolve, the technical tricks will fade, but the value of genuine human insight will only increase. Start building that trust today, and your SEO performance will thank you tomorrow.

1q01z58,http://www.echosofme.io,Claude helped me solve a problem,"I’m getting older and often reflect back on life, my mind often wanders from “what are the lessons leaving my children “ to “I wish I could speak to my grandfather” (who raised me). As I think about the future, I lean into things I do every day. For instance, each day I ground myself through journaling, it’s how I start my day—-black coffee and write down my thoughts. 

That’s when it hit me. What if I could write down my thoughts, opinions, and experiences into an app, that eventually could become a LLM I “give” my children. To be clear, it’ll never be you, but it’s meant to be an AI digital avatar that your loved ones can chat with after you pass. 

Others have tried to solve this problem through other means, but what makes this different is the carefully curated questions to capture the essence of what makes you, “you”. It’s not just a random data dump of emails or text messages. 

The website is free to journal each day, along with basic analytics. There’s also a more advanced paid option that I’m continually improving and building on. 

I’d love your feedback on what’s been built. Truthfully, I’m excited to leave my children something meaningful when I pass but I can’t help but think there’s use cases for others. ",1,1767150011.0,ClaudeAI,2,1.0,False

Been Muslim for 7 years. 

Met my husband around a year or so after I converted. Got divorced a year later and ended up hang a daughter with him. Horrible marriage. 

Moved to a new state to start over. Met my current husband by mistake. Really felt he was a good man with a good deen, and didn’t mind that I was married previously. I wasn’t really interested in remarrying but I felt like Allah had put us in the same place at the same time and I decided to go for it. My family loved him, and we had a beautiful wedding. 

We’ve been married for a year and a half now and I feel like everyday with him is depressing me. I honestly don’t know if can do anything to make him happy. Every small thing I do sets him off. He has no future goals it seems. We have no money. And I personally think he didn’t want to marry a non-Arab (I am white), because our cultures are so different. He’s also an immigrant and has green card status through me, but stated since day 1 that he wasn’t looking for a green card but a real marriage. I also felt like he was looking for a real marriage, but now I’m starting to feel differently. 

I also hate the way he speaks to me. I could be relaxing on the couch, an he says “Yalla… go make me coffee” or “yalla go make me tea”. I just feel like him speaking to me this way has really put me off. I don’t feel like I have a lover, instead I am a servant. 

We rarely have sex, and funny thing is, as a woman, I have an incredibly high sex drive. I even bought lingerie today and showed him, to which he do not seem impressed. 

We do not pray together, nor do we do Islamic activities together. He often even says I know more about Islam than him sometimes. 

Overall, I could go on for hours. I feel really disappointed about the way my love life has gone since being Muslim. When even searching for my first husband, many men would not even give me a chance due to being a convert and being white. The marriage pool for converts is horrendous, and we end up with the worse individuals. 

Sometimes makes me wish I just married within my own culture to a non-Muslim. I feel my life would have been much better that way. But I wanted to do the right thing. 

If I do get divorced again, I have absolutely no interest in ever remarrying. It’s embarrassing enough to be married twice.

I worked at a coffee shop in college and have been trying to replicate good espresso at home. I recently switched to a bottomless portafilter, and despite going through several bags of coffee, I can’t seem to dial things in consistently. Shots swing between too fast or too slow, and flavors are often bitter, burnt, weak, or sour. Occasionally I get a decent shot, but overall consistency has been frustrating. Some shots are bad enough that I don’t feel great after drinking them.

⸻

Equipment
	•	Machine: Basic Delonghi espresso machine
	•	Grinder: Baratza Sette 270
	•	Portafilter: Bottomless 51mm
	•	Basket dose: 15g
	•	Tamper: Spring-loaded/pressurized tamper
	•	WDT: Yes
	•	Scale & timer: Accurate to 0.1g

⸻

Beans
	•	Roaster: Local roaster
	•	Roast level: dark 
	•	Freshness: Within normal post-roast window (not grocery store beans)

⸻

Recipe / Shot Data
	•	Dose: 15g
	•	Yield: ~30g (aiming for ~1:2)
	•	Time: Highly inconsistent (sometimes fast, sometimes choking)

⸻

Taste Issues
	•	Bitter / burnt
	•	Sour
	•	Thin / weak
	•	Rarely balanced

⸻

Workflow
	1.	Grind fresh with Sette 270
	2.	WDT thoroughly
	3.	Level and tamp once with spring tamper
	4.	Pull shot using bottomless portafilter
	5.	No intentional preinfusion (machine default only)

⸻

What I’ve Tried
	•	Adjusting grind size finer/coarser
	•	Adjusting dose slightly
	•	Multiple puck prep variations
	•	Multiple bags of coffee

Despite this, results remain inconsistent. It seems like any change I make, makes the shot drastically worse then I spend 15 minutes just trying to get back where I started. 

⸻

What I’m Looking For

Before this, we were dating for a couple months and then tried to do long distance for about 4-5 months. He had plans to move to my city, and had a job lined up. Three months before the move, he broke up with me over FaceTime, when I had tickets to see him in a couple weeks for his graduation ceremony. It completely broke me and the reasons he gave me were that he thought we were not compatible and he sees me more like a friend than a partner. I became very cold and cut him off and then we didn’t talk at all over the next 4 months. 

When he moved to my city, he reached out and asked me for coffee where he told me how he wants to get back together and how he’s sorry and made a mistake. He also admitted he was dating someone else over the summer, supposedly starting as a “rebound” right after he broke up with me. It just completely shattered my trust and I was extremely upset when I heard that and I told him I can’t do it because it will never be the same. 

However, after a month I had a change of heart and decided to give in another try since I still had feelings for him so since then we’ve been dating. 

He’s been a good boyfriend to me, reassures me all the time and tells me how much he loves me, tells me I’m his person and he wants to help me get over my feelings on being betrayed. He says he wants to take things further and talks about commitment and engagement but I just feel like I can’t forgive what he’s done. I feel cheated on and I’m worried he’ll do it again. I’m even reluctant to live together even though he wants to and I think it would be the next step in our relationship. 

I’m not sure what to do. At this point I think I’ve given this enough time but I still can’t shake off the deep disappointment I felt towards him. My image of him has been completely changed and I only see him as a flawed person who broke my trust.

We are compatible in a lot of ways, we share the same background, are both from similar schools and have a lot of similarities in how we were brought up. We have a good time together and are very attracted to each other and are both independent and well-rounded individuals. 

With time, I have gained more trust in him but it’s really never the same. Will this solve over time and is it worth considering engagement?

Businesses scramble to hire freelance writers or ramp up their internal production schedules, aiming to flood their blog with daily updates. The goal is simple visibility. If we throw enough mud at the wall, some of it has to stick.

However, modern search engines don't operate on a ""more is better"" basis. In fact, this knee-jerk reaction to underperformance is often the very thing that cements a site’s failure. Google has evolved far beyond rewarding raw frequency. Today, blindly increasing your publishing volume without addressing the underlying **SEO content strategy** is like trying to fill a leaking bucket by turning up the water pressure. You might see a momentary splash, but you aren't fixing the leak.

# The Myth of ""Content Velocity""

For a long time, content velocity—the speed at which you publish new pages—was a legitimate competitive advantage. Ten years ago, if you could publish faster than your competitor, you could likely outrank them. The internet was less crowded, and search algorithms were hungry for fresh data.

That era is over. We have entered a phase of content saturation. Every industry, niche, and sub-topic is overflowing with articles, guides, and opinion pieces. When you prioritize volume over value, you aren't just adding to your own library; you are adding to the noise of the internet.

The problem with the ""publish more"" mindset is that it ignores the health of the existing ecosystem. A website is not a landfill where you simply dump new URLs. It is a library. If a library is filled with thousands of books with repetitive titles, outdated information, and thin pages, patrons won't be able to find what they need. Similarly, if your site is bloated with mediocre content, search engines struggle to understand what you are actually an expert in.

# How Over-Publishing Hurts Your Rankings

When businesses ignore the nuance of **content quality vs quantity**, they often inadvertently sabotage their own rankings. Increasing volume without a clear plan leads to technical and semantic issues that can drag your entire domain authority down.

# Keyword Cannibalization

This is the most common side effect of the ""more content"" approach. When you force your team to write three articles a week about ""project management software,"" you eventually run out of unique angles. You end up with five different pages targeting the exact same set of keywords.

Instead of having one powerful, authoritative page that ranks #1, you have five mediocre pages fighting for the #10 spot. You are effectively competing against yourself. Google’s algorithm looks at these five pages, gets confused about which one is the ""master"" resource, and often decides to rank none of them highly. You have split your own equity.

# Diluted Authority and ""Thin"" Content

Every page on your site should serve a distinct purpose and offer significant value. When quotas drive production, writers are often forced to stretch thin ideas into full-length articles. This results in ""thin content""—pages that offer little value to the user.

If Google crawls your site and finds that 40% of your URLs are low-value, repetitive, or unengaging, it impacts how the algorithm views your domain as a whole. You are signaling that you are a producer of noise, not a provider of answers. A smaller site with fifty incredible, high-performing articles will almost always outrank a massive site with 5,000 pages of fluff.

# Wasted Crawl Budget

Search engines allocate a ""crawl budget"" to your site—a limit on how many pages their bots will crawl and index during a given timeframe. If you have thousands of low-quality pages, you are wasting the bot's time. They might spend their budget crawling your insignificant posts while missing the updates you made to your most important revenue-generating pages.

# The AI Content Explosion

The temptation to choose quantity over quality has arguably never been higher, thanks to the explosion of generative AI. Tools like ChatGPT and Jasper allow marketing teams to generate thousands of words in minutes. The barrier to creating content has dropped to near zero.

Consequently, the web is experiencing a tsunami of AI-generated copy. While AI is a powerful tool for outlining and ideation, relying on it to mass-produce finished articles amplifies the issues mentioned above. AI models predict the next likely word in a sentence; they do not conduct original research, they do not have unique experiences, and they cannot offer contrarian viewpoints.

When you use AI to scale volume without heavy human editing and strategic oversight, you create ""commodity content."" This is content that looks and sounds exactly like everyone else's. In an ocean of AI-generated sameness, **topical authority SEO** becomes the only life raft. Google is actively tuning its systems to find ""Helpful Content""—material that demonstrates experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness (E-E-A-T). A generic AI article produced just to hit a publishing quota rarely meets these criteria.

# What High-Performance SEO Actually Looks Like

If pumping out blog posts isn't the answer, what is? The shift needs to move from ""production"" to ""architecture."" High-performance SEO is about building a resource that serves the user's intent so well that Google has no choice but to rank it.

# Intent-Driven Content

Before a writer types a single word, you must understand the ""search intent."" What does the user actually want?

* **Informational:** Are they looking for a definition?
* **Transactional:** Are they ready to buy?
* **Commercial:** Are they comparing options?

If you write a 2,000-word guide for a user who just wanted a quick definition, you have failed the intent, no matter how good the writing is. **Blog strategy SEO** is about matching the format and depth of your content to the specific needs of the searcher.

# The Power of Topical Authority

Rather than writing about random topics that have high search volume, successful SEO strategies focus on **topical authority SEO**. This means ""owning"" a specific subject area completely.

Imagine you sell coffee machines. Instead of writing one post about coffee, one about tea, and one about smoothies, you should go deep on coffee. You write the ultimate guide to brewing (the ""pillar"" content) and then support it with smaller ""cluster"" articles about water temperature, grind size, and bean origins. You link all these cluster posts back to the pillar.

This ""hub and spoke"" model tells Google, ""We are the experts on coffee."" It creates a web of relevance that is hard for competitors to break. A site with high topical authority on a small subject will often outrank a giant news site that covers the topic superficially.

# Internal Linking Structure

Volume creates isolated pages; strategy creates a network. A high-performance strategy ensures that equity flows through the site. When you publish a new piece, it shouldn't sit on an island. It should link to your service pages and older, high-authority blog posts. This keeps users on your site longer and helps search bots discover your deep content.

# Content Pruning: The ""Less is More"" Approach

Sometimes, the best way to grow your traffic is to delete content. It sounds counterintuitive, but ""content pruning"" is a secret weapon of many SEO experts.

Conduct an audit of your site. Look for pages that:

1. Have zero traffic in the last 12 months.
2. Have zero backlinks.
3. Are outdated or irrelevant.

You generally have three options with these pages:

* **Update:** If the topic is still relevant, rewrite it to be better.
* **Merge:** If you have three short posts about the same thing, combine them into one ultimate guide and set up 301 redirects.
* **Delete:** If it serves no purpose, remove it (and 410 or 301 the URL).

By trimming the dead weight, you consolidate your authority and show Google that you only maintain high-quality resources. It is not uncommon for sites to delete 30% of their pages and see a 50% increase in traffic.

# Strategic Planning vs. Blind Velocity

The difference between a failing blog and a thriving one usually comes down to the planning phase.

**The ""More Content"" Approach:**

* **Goal:** Publish 5 times a week.
* **Metric:** Number of words written.
* **Tactic:** Find high-volume keywords and write articles.
* **Result:** High output, low engagement, eventual decline.

**The ""Strategic"" Approach:**

* **Goal:** Solve specific user problems.
* **Metric:** Organic traffic, time on page, conversions.
* **Tactic:** Identify content gaps, update existing winners, build topic clusters.
* **Result:** Sustainable growth and high topical authority.

A strategic content plan is boring compared to the thrill of ""blasting out"" content. It involves spreadsheets, audits, and research. But it is the only way to build predictable, measurable SEO growth. It shifts the focus from ""How much can we write?"" to ""How much value can we provide?""

# Frequently Asked Questions

# Is posting daily good for SEO?

Not necessarily. Posting daily only helps if you can maintain an exceptionally high standard of quality for every single post. If increasing frequency leads to a drop in depth or accuracy, it will likely hurt your rankings. Consistency is important, but quality is vital. Posting one incredible article a week is better than posting five mediocre ones.

# How do I know if I have keyword cannibalization?

You can use SEO tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Google Search Console. Look at your target keyword and see if multiple URLs from your site are ranking for it, or if the ranking page keeps swapping back and forth. If Google can't decide which of your pages is relevant, you likely have a cannibalization issue.

# Should I delete old blog posts?

You should not just delete them blindly. Audit them first. If they have backlinks, you don't want to lose that authority. In that case, update the content or redirect the URL to a relevant, newer page. Only delete pages that have no value, no traffic, and no links.

# Can AI content rank on Google?

Yes, AI content can rank, but not simply because it is AI. It ranks if it is helpful, accurate, and satisfies user intent. Google’s guidance focuses on the *quality* of the content, not how it was produced. However, unedited, generic AI content rarely satisfies the ""Experience"" and ""Expertise"" components of E-E-A-T.

# Stop the Churn, Start the Strategy

It takes courage to stop the production line. When traffic is down, the pressure to ""do something"" is immense, and writing new blog posts feels like action. But movement is not the same as progress.

If your SEO is underperforming, the answer is rarely found in the ""New Post"" button. It is found in your analytics, in your audit spreadsheets, and in your customer research. It is found by refining your **SEO content strategy** to focus on **content quality vs quantity**.

Stop obsessing over how many times you hit publish this week. Start obsessing over how well you answered your customer's questions. Build **topical authority SEO** by creating the best resources on the web for your specific niche. Real growth doesn't come from writing more; it comes from writing better, smarter, and with clear intent.

1q01qc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ChasingTheRainbow_/comments/1q01qc7/how_to_help_my_partner_struggling_with_mental/,"""How to help my partner struggling with mental health""","If you found yourself googling ""how to help my partner struggling with mental health"" just know you're an incredible human being. And you're not alone. I was in the same position as you and when I googled those words I was met with mental health hotlines and list of 10 tips that basically suggest you ""just listen, don't judge"". How do you listen when your partner refuses to speak? How do you prompt a conversation when your partner is curled in a ball on the couch unable to move or speak? How long do you stay next to your partner, silent, with a hand on their back in show of support? How long do you stay in the relationship? Is my partner's behavior normal for a depressed/anxious person? At what point is this abuse? Does everyone's depression/anxiety look like this? Is this fixable? What I really needed was to hear from someone who has been in my shoes. And that is why I am writing this post. If there is someone, anyone that can relate to this and find my story helpful, this is for you.  
  
In hopes to remain anonymous I will refrain from using names of people and places. Know we are two successful individuals in our late 20s, early 30s, with amazing jobs, families, and friends. Mental health does not discriminate. Most people in our lives will never know the darkest of struggles we went through, And how I wish the topic was not so taboo. The shame my partner felt for having depression/anxiety meant he wanted as few people as possible to know what he was going through. It was a dark secret to keep. I fell victim to the shame myself. I didn't want to open up to family or friends in fear they would judge the person I loved the most. If it weren't for the consideration of my partner's privacy I would love to tell my story, unfiltered. While this story is largely about the mental health struggles my partner faced, this post is not for the one struggling with mental health, it's for the people supporting their partner with mental health. This is your story too.

For context, I stayed in the relationship for 6 years. The most transformative years of my life. Any 20-something year old female would understand the societal/biological pressure to stay, to make it work, after so much invested time and effort. To so badly want to chalk this up to ""nobody's perfect"" and hope he will find a way to cope, manage the mental illness. And I looked at it as an opportunity to prove to him, to myself, what a loyal and good partner I can be. He will change. If not for himself, then for me. Somewhere between year 2 and 3 of the relationship the mental illness came to a head. He could no longer hold a job. There were nights he would be pulling at his hair constantly, crying in pain, and saying ""I can't take this anymore."" I remember holding him in my arms as he nearly passed out from a panic attack and then rubbing his feet until he eventually fell asleep. It was 4am and it took me 30 minutes to get myself onto the bed and shut the light without a peep so as to not wake him. I woke up the next morning and went to my uncles funeral. So much of what I was going through in my life outside of him was brushed under the rug. A death in the family? A stressful job? It was nothing compared to the heaviness I would come home to every night.

In year 6 I decided to start keeping a journal. He didn't like that I was writing about him. He said he felt like a ""lab rat"" but understood that I needed a way to cope as well. In retrospect, I wanted to hold myself accountable. Years had passed and it felt like we would take 5 steps forward and 10 steps back every few months. I didn't want to blink and have another year go by feeling like i was in the same place as last year. The journal would hold me accountable. 

  
Below are the journal entries:

Tues, May 28 2024

I said go get more he said ""no"". I bring beer from the apartment and he chugged all 4 in 30 min. I brought up him eating 1.5 chocolate bars from the night before and he was triggered and said i should watch what i'm about to say. Wanted me to go home so he can order food cause he doesnt want to eat in front of me. He was clearly up tight and said he wanted to play video games. I said it's beautiful out and its Friday can we go outside? He refused so i left which turned into a fight. We ended up going to the diner together and further fight about him not paying rent. We went home in silence and didn't speak the rest of the night

Sat, June 1, 2024

He pulled me in to cuddle in the morning when we woke up. We had sex he went to the gym and I went to my parents pool with my sister. I stopped at the grocery store on the way home and made dinner. We ate the apartment together and watched a documentary and went to bed. Overall pretty good day.

Sun, June 2, 2024

Thought he was gonna wake up feeling terrible cause it's Sunday but he is surprisingly in a GREAT mood. He's joking laughing smiling. I'm going for a walk and hes going to the gym  


Mon, June 3, 2024

I went to work happy hour. I checked in every hour and came home at 10:30. He had cleaned the apartment, unloaded the dishwasher, folded the towels

Tues, June 4, 2024

Seemed like a pretty good day. He texted me at 6pm and asked if I needed anything from the store he was going to pick up waters for the apartment. I went for a walk when i got home from work and we hung out on the couch. He seemed to have a pretty good day.

Wed, June 5, 2024

He went straight home after work. Said he was going to work out but didnt. I ended up going over there to get outside. We played basketball and his neighbor gave us lettuce from his garden. I had to work when we got back home. Overall he seemed pretty good today. He did mention he needs a vacation

Havent been writing because hes been good. I've watched my parents dog the past 5 days so I didnt see him thattt much but he seemed good. Today he seemed okay but texted me ""depression is very bad today I'm sorry""

Fri, Jun 21 2024

Depression and anxiety at a 10. He can barely walk/talk. Feels he's going to pass out. But he went to work today. He's off the next few days.

Sun, Jun 23, 2024

He seems to be back in the ""this career has ruined my life"" phase. He says theres a pattern every 6 months and the career destroys him. Says he blames everyone for pressuring him and me for telling him to pick up more days. He said he knew he couldnt handle it but he listened and now look where he is. He can barely be in the room with family he's constantly pulling his hair and can barely speak.

Wed, Jun 26, 2024

He's had a rough few day. He can barely speak, doing anything is hard. He's constantly touching his hair. He has no appetite. I'm trying to get him to listen to a podcast on people in his field speaking about mental health but he hasn't listened.

Friday, June 28, 2024

He went back to work yesterday. He was debating not going in the morning but I told him he would regret it the second he called out if he did. He texted me during the day saying he doesn't know if he can stay the whole day. He ended up staying. He went to work today too and just texted me that he wants to sit in the yard and drink.

Tues, Jul 9, 2024

He was extremely anxious the week he went back to work. On Wed, July 3rd my parents dog had emergency surgery. He didn't come dts for fourth of july with my family because he was working friday. I didnt care because I'd rather him not worry about leaving early- it's far and he had to work so understandable. Friday he went into work and left because he had a migraine. Saturday he was extremely anxious. We took my dog home in the morning and I wanted him to come see the dog and he didnt because he was anxious yet he went to his brother's gf's graduation party from 4-8pm. I was annoyed he did that and said something to him about it. He said sorry and wanted to come visit the dog on Sunday morning. Sunday morning we slept until 10, got to visit the dog at 11:30 and he was already talking about how long we're staying cause he wants to go to the gym at 1. He is never with my family why cant he just put on a brave face for a few hours? He was extremely anxious and depressed al day. He hasnt gone into work Monday or Tuesday. He's spiriling again. We're talking about him going on medication. He says he needs help making an appt.

\*\* i did not journal again until November. We got engaged in October and what should have been the happiest nights of my life turned into the worst. We got engaged in our apartment. It was perfect. He had dinner planned just us two and then a celebration at a bar after with our family and friends. On the way to the bar he said he was anxious and wanted to take a xanex but didnt. At about 10pm the night is almost over and I could tell something was wrong. His shirt was absolutely soaked with sweat. He looked very drunk but our friends wanted to continue the celebration at another bar. I will not speak of what transpired from there but it was the darkest night of my life. For my own safety and unbeknownst to everyone else I slept at his parents house (the only other people who knew of his struggles) and he passed out at the apartment. I knew I should leave at that moment but I could not fathom breaking off an engagement after less than 24 hours. I woke up to a million congratulations texts and family telling me theyre so happy for me/us. I was a wreck. A broken mess. He eventually admitted to sneaking xanex midway through the night because he felt he was having a panic attack at the bar. He blacked out after that point and had little to no recollection of the events that took place after. I gave him an ultimatum- to stop drinking, and speak with a therapist or I walk away.\*\*

  
Sat, Nov 30, 2024

He spoke with the therapist for the first time by himself on Wednesday. We both took off Wed-Mon and we were supposed to go somewhere but didnt end up planning anything. He was not feeling great Wednesday he tends to get like this when he takes off and has free time to himself. He isnt very talkative and said hes not feeling great because he took off and shouldn't have since he works on commission. He was very upset he didnt work. He hasnt been sleeping well. Thursday was thanksgiving. we were at his familys all day and he was in his phone betting all day and barely spoke or was interactive with anyone including me. He said he needed to win to make up for not working Wednesday and he feels better about winning money. Friday he seemed to be better. We went to the diner for breakfast and then to his house and we're with his nieces all day and he was very playful. He said his heart is doing weird palpatation things. We got in a fight later on about not having sex. He said he has no sex drive from the Paxil which he stopped on Tuesday but he said will take time to get out of his system. He was mad because he doesnt want to talk about it but I ""force him and pull things out of him every 4-6 weeks"". He said youre the one who wanted me to go on meds and now you're mad at the side effects. I tried to call him out for how ridiculous that sounds. He knows he needed to go on meds. He never takes accountability and always blames everything on me. He always likes to call me crazy and say I'm dramatic. That night he woke me up cause he was having sleep paralysis and was saying he felt this fear and barely slept he would wake up every hour. I stayed up with him until he would falll back asleep. Next morning he was nice and thanked me and got a haircut went to the gym. We're supposed to go to a restaurant today for a possible wedding dinner venue.

Mon, Dec 2, 2024

We had a blow up fight Saturday before we went to dinner at the restaurant. He called me before and asked if I could pick him up/drive and I said can't you drive? what if i want to drink? He told me ive been drinking a lot lately more than i ever have, every weekend, even thanksgiving i had to drink. I told him he had balls since the night before i was up every hour consoling him with sleep paralysis and I'm also not the one who has a problem with alcohol. He said I should be supportive and if he can't drink I shouldn't when I'm with him. While I agree with that that's not what he said, instead he had to make it seem like I was out of control. On the way to the restaurant I was very mad and said he should be nothing but a model fiance after everything and instead he's the opposite and that I'm sick of being treated like shit. It's a recurring theme that he feels I have an attitude problem and think i can get away with everything just because things he's done are much ""worse"". In a way i kind of agree with him.

Friday, Dec 6, 2024

He walked in the door cursing because there was a note on the door that said they were coming in to service the apartment unit between 8-10am tomorrow. He's cursing so mad and I say lets be real you weren't going to sleep in anyway and he does ""oh yeah according to you I sleep in til the afternoon every weekend"". He was extremely moody trying to start a fight and then freaking out that his shirt button isnt cooperating. He is literally so mad it looks like he wants to punch something. He said he doesnt want to go to this work dinner tonight.

Thursday, Jan 2, 2025

Had some disagreements about wedding. I want to get married in June. Would like to be pregnant by end of the year

1. Although thats what i want is thats best for us? Prob not prob need to focus on us.

2. A part of me feels like I already delayed my life for him waiting for him to finish school, get through his issues, work, etc.

I'm dealing with a lawsuit, work, and wedding and I'm not good with planning. Finally set on one venue and then he calls and says no that place doesnt have good food.

I wasn't feeling good on NYE. I just wanted him to lay with me until i fell asleep and he couldnt. He was offering to go to the store to get me medicine which was nice but he was crawling in his skin at the thought of getting in bed laying down and cuddling. He also had food on the way which was a sore subject because we had just gotten back from dinner and he's supposed to be eating well. Then next day on New Years day I try and grab him to dance and he is absolutely disgusted wont even try. Hes fighting to get off me. He mentioned no DJ at wedding no first dance which I disagree with. I know we arent having a big traditional wedding just renting out a restaurant with family but still.

Saturday, Jan 4, 2025

Had a conversation last night about how he reacted when I got mad on the phone about him not liking the food at the restaurant (potentially wedding venue). Yes I cursed on the phone I apologized for that and explained why I was frustrated but that didnt warrant his reaction. Cursing and telling me to come bring him the remote downstairs. When he pulled up he was mad he had to get out of the car. When he came in he said I'm not talking about this and then proceeded to make comments and I would make a noise under my breath and he started freaking out saying I'm crazy and I make shit up cause I said I felt like he had a problem with every wedding thing I suggested. Anyway he didnt want to talk about it last night and I said we should. I said his reaction was not okay and I dont deserve to be talked to that way. He was stuck on the wedding venue thing and I was explaining I am not even set on the wedding venue and if we would just talk to me calmly we couldve discussed this. I said he never seems happy, never smilling, everything is always a fight. He said he never smiled the whole relationship and now its a problem? I'm more concerned about us than where when we're getting married. I said we should be having more fun an dhappier and he said how can i be happy living here it's a shoe box I'll be happy when I have a big house. I said thats a problem then because you shouldnt be basing your happiness on materialistic things. We should be happy together. We discussed how I hadn't put much effort into his love language I agreed and said sorry I'm struggling with it since I associate words with actions. He said you can't expect change if you dont change. Which I agreed with. Next morning he wakes up and says we cant go to the appt at the restaurant (potential wedding venue) at 6pm. He said we're never going to make it because I had an appt to try on wedding dresses at 3pm. And I was calmly explaining I talked to the guy at the restaurant  he said he would be there all night and its not like 6pm was set in stone I could call him and tell him 7 if he really wanted me to. He's clearly annoyed and saying he doesnt want to go and that we should just go next weekend. I was saying this shouldnt be a fight. I will make sure my appt does not go past 4:30 and its not like we have plans after we have more than enough time to go there. It's not like we're married to this place its just to see it it's been two years since we've been there maybe we'll hate it. He continues to make comments and he's clearly annoyed. I'm very sick of always fighting.

Tue Jan 7, 2025

I listened to a podcast and feel like there were a lot of similarities. Friends dont like him, he ruined a moment for me (engagement), when he has to go to my family stuff he either doesnt come or he does not put on a good face and looks miserable, cycles - she was saying in the beginning a lot of good then only good after the bad and then eventually not much good.

\*\*On Sat Jan 11 I found out I was pregnant. Despite everything we were going through we were so excited. My sister just did IVF and this meant our babies would be three weeks apart. \*\*

Sun, Jan 19, 2025

he said to me ""it delays my healing when you dont leave me alone""

\*\*I had my first ultrasound in late January and I was measuring earlier than expected. After daily blood draws at the doctor and multiple scans over the next couple of weeks the baby was not growing as expected. It was a medical ""missed miscarriage"". My body was not naturally miscarrying so I needed to have a D&C.""

Tues, Mar 4, 2025

D&C today. Yes he took off he didnt let me forget it and also you can take off two days to get a tattoo but hold it over my head when you have to take a day off for my D&C today? He had only come to one other dr appt with me (the first one). Is you taking me to the D&C the only supportive thing? When we got back I fell asleep for 3ish hours and he was not back yet. He said he would be back in an hour when I texted him and that he was working out. He asked if i needed anything and I asked him for a coffee which he brought me. When he got back he said he needed to get things done on his computer like bills and stuff he doesnt have time to do so I sat at the table with him trying to talk to him but he was focused on that and I let him. I asked him if we can talk about the wedding later after dinner he was apprehensive but said yes. Then he stayed on his computer all night in the bedroom coming up with designs for his new tattoo which I understand he needs to do by Saturday. It was 7pm at this point he still hadnt ordered dinner I kept asking him how is it going did he want to eat and he seemed stressed. At 8 when his food got here I asked if i could talk about wedding/italy and he was nasty cursed that he needed to finish his tattoo design. I explained I was not feeling very supported today once we got back and he says I only focus on the negative and dont talk about all the support he's shown (again I'm thankful but is him taking the day off today really that supportive?) I explained we never get the chance to talk about things only Sundays according to him which is not always true and so when I ask to talk about things in advance and he says yes but then goes back on it it makes me upset because we never have an opportunity. At first he denies it and says we talk everyday. I explaini not about important things. He says he got in a bad mood today from work texting him about things. I said he shouldnt let work affect his personal life and shouldnt bring the emotions home I had to clarify that he doesnt talk about work a lot of ""bring work home"" in the the typical aspect of actually talking about it he just brings the emotions associated with it home. And it shouldnt impact his personal life as much as it does especially on a day like today. He seems like he understood kept saying he didnt want to talk about himself anymore then said ""I'm so fucking fat a tattoo is not going to look good on a fat fuck. I'm getting up at 5 tomorrow. I have too many fucking issues I can't be fixed.""

Thurs Mar 13, 2025

Convo with therapist was perfect timing. Couldnt have been better timing he said the exact words ""i'm crawling in my skin"" twice within the last hour. I continued to hug him tell him I loved him I prayed over him rubbed his back til he eventually fell asleep

Sun Mar 23, 2025

Wed/Thurs he was amazing smiling joking laughing. Friday he made comments about work the next day how he was stressed it was going to be so busy and he wont have time for a haircut and then he has to go straight from work to his cousins. Saturday he gets done with work in a terrrrrible mood because the highway is shut and its saying its going to take 115 minutes to get to his cousins. He ends up turning around and I called and stayed calm and said I'll order you something I'm sure you're starving. He ended up calming down saying thank you but he was still stressed. He got home and was so stressed he didnt go to his cousins when his parents made it there. I was originally going to go to my sisters while he was at his cousins but now that he didnt go I was debating on not going to my sisters and he was stressed about that too. The entire night he was saying how stressed he was and needed 1 glass of wine. He says he read a study that 1 glass of wine takes you out of fight or flight mode. Then hes just irritable and not in a good mood and when we get home I'm at the point where I was patient and nice for 5 hours I cant do it anymore and I try and explain why I needed to go in my room and he immediately gets defensive and then I get angry. And sexually frustrated on top of it. Next day I dont end up going to the concert I was supposed to go to and he was saying how he wants to sleep in. I went to the grocery store at 9am and when i get home hes still sleeping and like grunting at me. And you can tell hes already in a moooood he wont even look at me when he wakes up and then hes like ""I got things to do today so just cause youre home now doesnt mean i can just sit around."" We fight over his tone and he claims his tone is fine ""here we go"" he says. I'm getting extremely frustrated and he admits hes in a terrible mood that cant be fixed nothing anyone can do about it. Then he mentions its already 11am and he hasnt done anything. Meanwhile he WANTED to sleep in hes been saying that for days.

1q01oro,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1q01oro/request_accepted_part_1/,"Request Accepted, Part 1","The TV in the diner was playing some morning talk show when I turned the key.

""This week on News for Thought—how to tell if someone likes you, loves you, or wants to murder you.""

I wasn't really listening. Just needed something other than silence while I checked the app.

""Eye contact is everything,"" the expert said. Some doctor. ""65-75% of the conversation? Normal engagement. 75-85? They're interested. 85-95%, Maybe in love.""

I scrolled through ride requests. Most were too far. Gas isn't cheap.

""But 95 - 100? Constant, unbroken eye contact?"" She paused. ""They want you dead.""

The anchor laughed. Nervous.

I turned it off.



First pickup was easy. Guy named Darian. Needed a ride across town.

""Ridr for Darian?""

""That's me.""

""I'm Grant. Hop in. Need the trunk?""

""Nah.""

He settled into the backseat. I pulled out.

""AC? Music?""

""Warm it up. Local classic rock if you got it.""

I turned the knob. The radio crackled to life.

""Welcome to 87.6 where a lot of people with faces for radio came to you \*echo effects\* CAME TO YOU to bring you the best \*echo effects\* THE BEST classic rock of the 90s.""

Bon Jon Bovi came on. ""We certainly did NOT Start the Fire. 

I remember when songs weren't political. Just about good ol things us kids did like arsen. Am I right?

Darian looked at me with a weird look

""Sure I guess""

Darian tapped his foot. Hummed along. Seemed happy.

Most passengers don't talk to me. I sometimes prefer it that way. I drive hundreds of people every week. If they all wanted conversation, I'd go insane. I just drive. Let my mind wander. Keep things quiet. But sometime, I use my charisma to get a good rating and a tip

""You pull any badies lately?"" I said

""How old are you?""

""46... why..""

Darian didn't talk to me the rest of the ride after that

The bar appeared ahead. Neon lights bleeding into the night haze. Darian's grin stretched wider as we pulled up.

""Thanks, man. Great night.""

""You too.""

The door shut. $18.62 hit my account.

I parked in a loading zone and opened the app again.



Next request was from someone named Hailey. Apartment pickup. Not too far.

I accepted it and drove over, already regretting the decision when I saw two girls stumbling down the exterior stairs from the third floor.

""OUR RIDR IS HEEEERE!""

""WOOOO I HOPE HE'S CUTE!""

I sighed and rolled down the window.

""Hi, are you Hail—""

""OMG HE KNOWS MY NAME! I'M FAMOUS!""

""He's not cute. He's old.""

The other girl slapped her arm. ""Don't be mean! He's just our driver. TO THE PARTY DRIVER!""

They piled into the backseat, giggling.

""So. Are you married? Single? It's complicated? My mom is like, desperate for a man.""

I glanced in the rearview. The friend looked mortified.

""You want this driver to date your mom?""

""Divorced,"" I said.

""OHHH. Tell us the details!""

""I'd rather not.""

""Fine. Boring."" She crossed her arms. ""Are we there yet?""

""Three minutes.""

""Can you play music? KOSHA! OMG PLAY ME SOME KOSHA!!! CLICK CLOCK IM OUT OF SOCKS FOOD FIGHT PURE DELIGHT IM GONNA PARTY TILL MIDNIGHT!

I turned on the radio. I kept lowering the volume hoping she would also lower hers. But she just kept getting louder. 

When we finally pulled up to the party house, I was ready to drive off a bridge.

""THANKS! BYE BRETT!""

The door slammed.

I sat there. Breathed.

""Thank fuck,"" I muttered.

My phone buzzed. Another request. I declined it. Needed food. Needed quiet.



The gas station was empty. I filled up the tank, grabbed some meat sticks, crackers, cheese. A bottle of water.

""This is living,"" I said to no one.

I drove to the back of a McDoohickie's parking lot. The same spot I'd been sleeping in for the past three weeks. Put up the cardboard window blinds. Pulled out my pillow and blanket from the trunk. Reclined the seat as far as it would go.

""God If my ex-wife saw this she would be so jealous""

I closed my eyes and passed out within minutes.



*Knock knock knock.*

I jerked awake. Disoriented. I rubbed my face and pushed one of the blinds aside.

A flashlight beam hit my eyes.

""Roll the window down.""

I fumbled for the key. Turned it just enough to lower the window.

Officer McDunnuh leaned down. ""Grant. Morning, buddy. Sleep well?""

""What's wrong?""

""Got some reports. Someone sleeping in their car in this lot. You know I gotta follow up.""

""You told me I was good to park here.""

""I know. And I'm not writing you up. Just doing my job so I can report back. But listen—move when you can. Try to rotate spots. If people see you in the same place every night, they'll keep calling.""

""Yeah. Got it. Thanks, McDunnuh.""

He nodded and walked back to his cruiser.

I packed up. Blinds down. Pillow in the trunk. Blanket folded. Started the car and drove to the only place open this early.



A Breakfast Place.

That's what the sign said. Simple. Honest. I liked it.

""Morning, Genevieve. Usual.""

She smiled. ""Already coming. Coffee?""

""Please.""

I slid into my booth and pulled out my phone. Checked my earnings from the night before.

The TV above the counter was playing the news.

""Just in! In today's segment on top 10 side gigs in Partsmouth, Ride sharing is BOOMING! We have seen a nearly 872% increase in ride sharing just this month! Here to talk about that more is Honcho Bererra""

Grant checks his Ridr app

Balance: $82.17

""Well shit."" 

""So it looks like Anchor man Arthur that we simply do not know why ride sharing is booming! We have a population of 10,000 and are seeing similar ride share numbers as a city with 100,000 people. ""

""Incredible. How did you come to this conclusion Honcho?""

Honcho looks at the screen. His eyes intensify

He puts his hands up in front of his face

One hand clasps his thumb with all his fingers.

The other hand the same. But only the index finger is clasped.

He puts his hands together.... Then pulls them away... Then together... Then away....Then together..... Then he stops.

""Amazing"" Says they Anchor.

I blinked. What the hell was that?

Genevieve set my plate and coffee down. ""Enjoy, hon.""

""Thanks.""

I scrolled through the app while I ate. Found a decent request. Airport run. Good money.

I left a twenty on the table and walked out.

Graves throws a $20 on the table before getting the check

Thanks Gen! Keep the rest! Have a good morning!

Genevivie looks at the $20 and the recipt.

Genevive puts the 20 in the register and puts 2 nickles in the tip jar 

""Ugh."" She sighs.

The pickup was at a Mongomery Cheese hotel.

A man stood on the curb. Perfectly still. Brown suit. Hat in his hand.

I pulled up. ""Good morning. Airport for Mr. Jones?""

He didn't answer. Just opened the door and sat down.

I glanced in the rearview. ""How are you today? Need AC? Music?""

His eyes flicked up.

Met mine in the mirror.

Wide. Unblinking. His entire face frozen.

I looked away. ""Nice suit. Work trip?""

Nothing.

He stared straight ahead now. Didn't move. Didn't blink. Didn't shift his weight.

I turned on the radio. Anything to fill the silence.

Fourteen minutes to the airport.

Fourteen minutes of nothing. No sound. No movement. My hands were slick on the wheel. My heart wouldn't slow down.

Even the divorce hadn't felt this uncomfortable.

Finally, we pulled up to Departures.

""Well. Here we are.""

He stepped out. Put his hat on. Stood on the curb.

And stared at me.

I pulled away. Fast.

""Thank fuck that's over,"" I muttered.

I glanced in the rearview to merge.

He was in the backseat.

Same position. Same stare.

I slammed the brakes.

Whipped around.

Empty.

No one there.

But I saw him. I know I did. That stare. Those eyes.

I sat on the side of the road. Engine running. Breathing hard.

It took twenty minutes before I could drive again.



I pulled into a parking lot. Opened the app.

The notification count kept climbing.

Ride request. Ride request. Ride request.

I scrolled.

1. 2. 3. 4.......

12.. 13.. 14.. 15....

I kept scrolling.

29.... 30.... 31....

31 requests.

Over christmas we got chatting about Bill C9, which is the Liberal's governments attempt to make reading the books of Leviticus, Deuteronomy and Romans Illegal and punisble as a hate crime. 

This is the very first time weve strongly agreed on anything political, both of us agreed its a complete and total clear cut trampling of the right to freely practice your religion, and if it passes we would both seriously consider permanently leaving Canada, and it didnt stop there. 

Surprisingly we agreed that our self defense laws need to change to favor people defending themselves against crime after we got to chatting about a case near me. What happened there was a guy broke into someones home at 3am with a crossbow, homeowner stabbed him with a kitchen knife but the homeowner was still arrested. Most surprisingly, she agreed that our latest gun confiscation is nothing but a gun grab that will do nothing to curb gun crime, because legal guns are extremely rarley the issue. 

Honestly its just refreshing agreeing with someone who couldnt be more opposite without the screaming and name calling, just genuine honest conversation, no gotchas no bad faith points, and not afraid to ask questions and dig deeper. I really wish more people outside of my family were willing to sit down over coffee with someone they disagree with and just, talk.

high school, philly area. a major local radio station, wysp, airs 'the comedy hour' every sunday nite. format was hearing a person tuning a radio dial, getting a soundbite/snippet from a commercial, gospel tune, etc., then a comedy bit. everything from spike milligan , abbot and costello, to pryor, and carlin, and everything in between. at the end of the hour, they'd announce the artist's names..never missed a broadcast while i lived there.

so the stiller and meara sketch  they played was a take on sex discrimination in reverse. anne , the boss, comes on to jerry, a truck driver for her company. she tries to force an invite in for coffee and he keeps making lame excuses, she keeps insisting (js: -it's just that i'm a gemini, and i'm on the cusp'. am: 'i don't care if you're a rosicrucian! all i want's a cup of coffee!').

long story short, phil the trucker is actually 'phyllis bataglia' ,a member of 'womens rights now' who transitioned to a male, to become a trucker.

sketch ends w/ meara going 'phil, phil, you need a shave!'. stiller responds 'so do you, sweetie'

any help finding the name of the sketch or an album it's on, if any, would be amazing. been searching for some years now on the interwebs using various quotes etc and no scratch.

:)
