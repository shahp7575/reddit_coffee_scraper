We also both play Marvel Rivals so we chatted a bit about that. Although, she had a complete lack of knowledge about Marvel characters. So I had to school her a bit lol.

On her profile she lived relatively close and I figured we'd hit it off so why not suggest we chat in person? I asked her if she wanted to get coffee sometime and chat ""IRL"". She said she wasn't interested. And that's when I called her a skank.",1,1753179209.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

Accommodation: Stayed at Zostel 2.0 and honestly, I totally get the hype. Property is quite big with multiple dorms. There's a lot to do in the common area like games, books, activities and location is perfect.

**Day 1:**

Took a direct night bus from Chandigarh to Bir and reached by 11 AM. Had breakfast at June 16 Cafe - the cutest cafe there and their bakery items are absolutely delicious. Highly recommend it. After that, I checked into the hostel rested a bit and then went to explore Chokling Monastery and Nyingma Monastery. Later, I stopped by Cafe Cloud Door for a quick bite.

In late evening, I did hang out in the hostel common area with other travellers. As it was a Saturday night, there was a fun singing/karaoke session too. Had dinner at cafe which is in hostel.

**Advice** : I highly recommend visiting at least one monastery between 4‚Äì6 PM to attend the evening prayer - it was such a peaceful experience.

**Day 2:**

Went to Pahadee Cafe for breakfast and ended up chatting with another solo traveller. Then headed to Bir Main Road to catch a local bus to Andretta Pottery. Spent the day exploring Andretta. Highly recomment to go Dhauladhar Cafe there, it is running by ladies, and I never felt this welcoming at any cafe before.  

Unexpectedly got invited to a house party in Palampur by some locals - such a unique and warm experience! Met many interesting people, all running their own businesses. They dropped me back at the hostel late at night.

**Day 3:**

Woke up early and went to Barot Valley on a scooty with another solo traveller from my dorm. Explored the valley, had breakfast, and chilled at the hostel. Later, grabbed evening snacks at Cafe 360, and then took my bus back to Chandigarh.

# 4. The One‚ÄëSize Nudge

**Scene:** ‚ÄúUpgrade now!‚Äù banner screams at a first‚Äëday tester and a power user alike.  
User‚Äôs head‚Äëvoice: ‚ÄúEasy, I just got here.‚Äù

**Fix:** Gate the upsell behind usage (30‚ÄØ% of plan limits). Annoyance down, upgrade clicks up.

Team‚Äôs head‚Äëvoice: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only a 2‚Äëminute ticket, move on.‚Äù

**Fix:** Every canned reply opens a ‚Äúdoc gap‚Äù card. Three clones in a week = tweak copy or add an inline tip. Loop disappears.

No redesigns. No new features. Just gremlin hunting.

Any advice?,"Hi all, (this is my very first Reddit post!) my bf and I have been together for nearly three years and have been living together for almost 10 months. I love him dearly, his calm and relaxed nature is great as I tend to be anxious, and the place we have together is in a good neighbourhood, has vintage features that I really love, and is really a step up for both of us. But since moving in together, I have been stressed out to the point where I'm constantly in a rather bad mood and borderline depressed all the time. This is because, while I am meticulously organised, tidy, and put things away after I use them, my bf leaves messes and piles of things wherever he goes. 

Thinking back to when we started dating, I should have paid more attention to the signs that he was like this. His old place was tiny and he shared it with multiple roommates, and it was always a mess and very dirty (I even developed a dust mite allergy from staying over at his). He would leave all his clothes on the floor, use the same towel for months without washing it, and every single surface was completely covered with an assortment of trash and personal items, and absolutely coated with dust. I did bring it up at the time, saying 'yo, this is pretty bad, you should take better care of your things and yourself' and he would say he knew and that he had no choice but to be messy because of how little space he had. I believed this I guess, and I also thought that maybe he wasn't doing well mentally for a while, so I cut him some slack. 

But now that we have moved in together, and have much more space and ample storage, things have not changed. I keep finding mouldy coffee and tea cups all around, he keeps all his things in piles (and complains when he cant find anything lol), and doesn't clean up spills or crumbs in the kitchen. It's just driving me crazy, partly because I feel compelled to clean a mess  when I see one, so I am constantly cleaning up after him. It's feeling like I'm being a mother to this grown ass man. 

We have talked before and he's basically said to let him know what he should do when it comes to chores, tidying up, etc, but this has not helped the situation. I really don't want to just keep saying, 'clean this, clean that' because I will get so sick of it and it takes so much energy from me. I really just want him to make an effort to be more conscious of his surroundings, because when it boils down to it, I think he's just not 'here' in a sense. He's not observant, an dit doesn't register when things are messy because he's up in his head. Whereas I am hyper observant (maybe too much) and things like messes and clutter really bother me and prevent me from feeling relaxed or being able to focus. 

Does anyone have advice for how to deal with this? How can I make him see things from my perspective? Am I being unreasonable? Any advice on this situation would be very greatly appreciated! 

TLDR: My BF is very messy and it's stressing me out. I have talked to him about it, but he is failing to grasp why it bothers me and has not changed his ways. What can I do to help him improve his cleanliness and see things from my perspective?

Sprinkles, chocolate shavings, fruit pieces, and sauces can be added to each petal or to the center of the flower, allowing for further personalization. This feature encourages creativity and allows consumers to tailor their Ice Cream Daisy to their individual preferences.

**Variety of Flavors:** Ice Cream Daisy is available in a wide array of flavors, ranging from classic favorites to more exotic and innovative options.

Popular choices include vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, mint chocolate chip, and cookies and cream. However, many ice cream shops and manufacturers are also experimenting with unique flavor combinations, such as lavender honey, salted caramel, and spicy mango. This extensive flavor range ensures that there is an Ice Cream Daisy to suit every palate.

**Unique Presentation:** The Ice Cream Daisy offers a visually appealing and Instagram-worthy presentation.

The flower shape, combined with the colorful array of flavors and toppings, makes it a standout dessert. This aesthetic appeal is particularly important in today's social media-driven world, where food presentation is often as important as taste.

The individual petals can be easily broken off and enjoyed, making it a convenient and mess-free dessert option. This ease of consumption makes it a popular choice for both children and adults.

**Social Media Appeal:** In today's visually driven world, the Ice Cream Daisy's unique presentation makes it highly shareable on social media platforms.

1m69xp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalMarketing/comments/1m69xp8/why_your_google_my_business_gets_zero_calls/,Why your Google My Business gets zero calls (5-minute audit checklist),"I‚Äôve helped multiple local businesses fix their GMB profiles this year. Same problem every time.

You think your profile looks fine. It doesn‚Äôt. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs killing your calls:

The 5-Minute GMB Audit:

‚ñ° Business hours showing correctly?
Check on mobile, not desktop. If hours say ‚Äúmight be closed‚Äù or show wrong timings, customers won‚Äôt risk calling.

‚ñ° Phone number clickable and working?
Call your own number from the GMB listing. If it doesn‚Äôt connect immediately or goes to voicemail, fix it now.

‚ñ° Photos uploaded in last 30 days?
Stale photos = dead business in customers‚Äô minds. Upload SOMETHING weekly. Even your morning coffee if you have to.

‚ñ° Services section filled out completely?
Blank services = customers don‚Äôt know what you actually do. List everything, even obvious stuff.

‚ñ° Reviews responded to?
Unresponded reviews signal neglect. Reply to every single one, even 5-star ratings.

‚ñ° Posts published recently?
Last post from 2023? Customers assume you‚Äôre closed. Post weekly updates, offers, anything.

The killer insight: Most businesses have 1-2 star reviews at the top because they never respond to negative feedback. Google shows unresponded bad reviews first.

Quick fix that works: Respond to your worst review professionally today. Watch it drop in visibility within days.

Common mistake I see: Perfect 5-star ratings with zero details. Looks fake. Ask customers for specific, honest feedback about their actual experience.

It took me months to figure this out. Anyone else notice weird GMB ranking patterns lately?‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã",1,1753178108.0,DigitalMarketing,1,1.0,False

**Wake Up With Intention**

Starting your day with purpose can significantly impact how productive and balanced the rest of your day will be. Rather than diving into emails or scrolling through social media, dedicate the first hour after waking up to a personal routine that grounds and energizes you.

Suggested morning practices:

* Set a consistent wake-up time.
* Get exposure to sunlight or fresh air.
* Hydrate before consuming coffee or tea.
* Try light stretches, meditation, or writing.

1m69ter,https://www.reddit.com/r/SwipeHelper/comments/1m69ter/i_just_dont_understand/,I just don‚Äôt understand..,"So, I‚Äôve been talking with this girl for a few months off of Hinge. We chatted pretty much every day or so. She works in law enforcement and it had been difficult to schedule a meet up but we finally set up a coffee date(her idea)for last Thursday. We decided to meet at the Starbucks near my gym between 3:30 and 4. I was really nervous about meeting her as her profile pictures weren‚Äôt great.  But not only did we have good conversations but physically she was the type of woman I really like and I rarely ever meet. She was a bodybuilder. I took a leap and just hoped she looked better in person. 

I got there early and had a coffee which probably didn‚Äôt help my nervousness. She showed up a few minutes after 4 which is fine as she text me that she might be a little late. She came in and I was happy as her pics really didn‚Äôt do her justice. She looked great. We hugged and then she went to order a drink.  Now when I ordered there were 2 baristas but one had just gone on break. The line was now a bit busy and it took like 10 minutes to get her drink which they got wrong so she was not too happy. 
We sat down and she told me that it had taken her 45 minutes to get there as she was elsewhere getting her hair dyed.  I told her that she should told me and we could have rescheduled. She did say that she almost canceled. I thanked her not canceling. 
We started talking about lots of things like our jobs and how she wasn‚Äôt happy with hers. We bonded talking about our families and how shit our dad‚Äôs are. We chatted about traveling , nutrition, supplement science and just basic getting to know one another fare. We joked and laughed. It all seemed like we were both having a good time. 
Then after an hour and a half she went to the bathroom. When she came back, she said that she had to go to get ready for her shift. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. So we hugged our goodbyes. She said that she had a good time and said she would text me to let me know she got in okay. 
So I left thinking we were all good. I get a text a bit later that she was home. I left her a voice note expressing that I had a good time and that it was great to finally meet. She said that she also had a good time and good chat. I text her a good night later on as we usually do. No reply which is fine. The next day I text her to have a good day at work and will chat later. Now mind you she always replied before but this time nothing. I left it alone for a few days but heard nothing back. 
I‚Äôm a bit confused so I message her to see how she was. I realized that maybe me being nervous put her off so said it took me a bit to warm up and ",1,1753177656.0,SwipeHelper,1,0.67,False

The title is pretty self-explanatory. 
I tried the Oura gen 3. It didnt work for me because it thought I was dead 1/3 of the night. During daytime it would generally pick up on a heart rate tho. But compared to my garmin watch, it would often be way of.

I should mention I don't actually have a medical condition, at least not one that's threatening. It's been checked. My heart rate just fluctuates a bit more than that of a general human being. And when I stress (happens a lot) or drink coffee (happens even more often) my heart often skips beats. 

Oura's support team and techs were really kind and tried their best to find a solution, but in the end they just refunded my purchase, saying the only thing their ring couldn't deal with was an irregular heartbeat.

So my question is, is there a ring that will still provide accurate data? Or do I just have to accept that for now I will remain smartringless and am stuck to a watch?

P.s. I don't use my watch during sleep. I just cant get used to it and it's enoying enough to keep me awake. Thus the search for a smart ring.",1,1753177579.0,SmartRings,0,1.0,False

First of all, I want to say a **deep, heartfelt thank you** to everyone who has contributed to this community. Your thoughtful replies, encouragement, and support kept me going when I doubted myself. Honestly, I wasn‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd ever get here, and I didn‚Äôt want to share my story until my endorsement was officially complete. So here it is ‚Äî my experience, from one hopeful to others who might be struggling. I truly hope it helps you keep going.

# üë§ My Background (for Context)

* Experience: 12 years in IT (Engineering, Change Management, Operations, Helpdesk, Desktop Support)
* Prior Certs: A+, Network+, Security+, PMP, ITIL, ISC2 CC

I say this upfront for transparency ‚Äî studying how ISC2 expects you to know the content was a grind despite having the necessary experience.

# ‚úÖ Free YouTube Resources

1. Prabh Nair

* ‚ÄúCoffee shots‚Äù and domain-specific prep.
* Great for exposing yourself to different question styles.
* I‚Äôd use these toward the end of your study plan to test retention.

2. Destination Certification Mind Maps

* Free on YouTube.
* At first, it felt like a wall of meaningless words. But after I studied, those words clicked ‚Äî they were tied to scenarios in my head. Great for reinforcing your mental framework.

3. Technical Institute of America (Andrew Ramdayal)

* 50-question sessions with mindset tips.
* Free on YouTube.
* Same deal ‚Äî use these near the end for variety and brain-flexing.

4. Kelly Handerhan ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhy You Will Pass‚Äù

* Just one video, but a solid mindset boost.
* I had taken her full course years ago but never sat for the test. This video helped mentally ‚Äúclose the loop‚Äù before committing.

# üìö Online Question Banks (The Core of My Studying)

1. Sybex Practice Tests, 4th Edition

* Hosted at [study.learning.wiley.com](https://study.learning.wiley.com) 
* 8 domain exams (100‚Äì105 questions each)
* 4 full-length exams (125 questions each)
* Register with your PDF or book to access.

2. Sybex Study Guide, 10th Edition

* Also on Wiley‚Äôs site
* 21 chapters with 20 review questions each
* 4 full-length exams included

# üí° How I Studied the Questions

When going through Sybex, I didn‚Äôt just memorize correct answers ‚Äî I studied every choice (A, B, C, D) and figured out why it was right or wrong. Then I‚Äôd ask:

* Why would I be doing this in a real job?
* What‚Äôs my role or title?
* Where am I in the process?

This approach made a huge difference ‚Äî especially in disaster recovery, incident response, and operational scenarios.

I also started breaking down questions like a lawyer: one or two words can totally change what‚Äôs being asked. This helped me filter out fluff and focus on the real goal. Think of yourself as a consultant: get in, get what matters, get out.

# üß™ Quantum Exams

hosted at: [https://quantumexams.com](https://quantumexams.com)

These aren‚Äôt actual exam questions, but the style really helped sharpen my focus. They trained my brain to:

* Spot key words
* Filter out irrelevant info
* Think situationally ‚Äî ‚ÄúWhere am I in the process?‚Äù

If you don‚Äôt have hands-on experience in SOC, ops, change management, or engineering, I highly recommend mentally placing yourself in those roles. Ask:  
Am I in planning? QA? Implementation?  
Am I approving something or building it?  
Same goes for testing ‚Äî do you understand when you'd use black-box vs white-box?

# My Quantum Scores:

45  
80  
60  
60  
80  
80  
60

After bouncing between 60‚Äì80, I didn‚Äôt feel ready. But after 8 months of non-stop studying, I was exhausted. I finally said screw it ‚Äî scheduled the exam, sat down, and passed at 100 questions.

# üéØ What Made the Difference

The key for me was variety and depth. I didn‚Äôt rely on one source. And I didn‚Äôt skim. I dug deep into every question bank I used. If you can handle different styles of questions and explain your reasoning ‚Äî you‚Äôre on the right track.

# ü§î What I‚Äôd Do Differently

I‚Äôd probably buy LearnZap. It‚Äôs similar to the Sybex question bank, but the analytics are way better. You can target your weak areas faster instead of grinding through everything blindly. I went full ‚Äúcover to cover‚Äù out of pure fear I‚Äôd miss something if I skipped a domain or chapter due to overconfidence. It worked‚Ä¶ but it wasn‚Äôt efficient.

# üèÅ Final Thoughts

Even with a strong background, I never felt totally ready. That‚Äôs normal. At some point, you have to trust your prep, block out the noise, and go for it.

If you're just starting out or don‚Äôt have much real-world IT experience, don‚Äôt get discouraged ‚Äî just give yourself more time, lean hard on scenario-based thinking, and make sure you know the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind every answer.

You‚Äôve got this. ‚úåÔ∏è

When I was 19-24 (a few years ago), I was a barista and had quite a few regulars. Loved the job and worked closing shift quite a bit. There was a guy that would frequently come to the stand around 7:45 on weekdays (we closed at 8) and would hang around to ‚Äòchat‚Äô while I closed down. Unfortunately he would order a 32oz redbull italian soda w/alternating flavors so this meant I could close down the coffee machines and clean them while he was there. 

The conversation went to what I was looking to do next and I mentioned the type of job I had been looking for and had found a few to apply. He ended up mentioning his local company was hiring for that particular job and that I should apply. Ended up telling him thanks and that I‚Äôll look into it with no commitment to apply. 

I ended up finding out that the company did indeed have a job posted for what I was looking for, and in these days we could still take a resume to drop off, hopeful to have a meeting or make a personal impression for the opening, so I dropped mine off and though I couldn‚Äôt meet with the hiring manager, resume was accepted!! 

The guy comes back that evening and naive me at the time confirmed I‚Äôd applied when he asked if I had submitted my resume or looked into it. All is fine, he orders his drink and is on his way, quicker than usual which made me happy to close by myself!! That same evening, I get a text on my phone asking ‚Äòhey what are you up to‚Äô and some comment on how I looked that evening. I didn‚Äôt recognize the number and at first thought it was a friend after hanging out. 
After a bit of face-value conversation, I asked who it was, and lo-and -behold, THE CUSTOMER, whatever his name was‚Ä¶ said it was him, redbull guy. 

First of all, GROSS. Second of all, I asked how he got my # and he said that after their receptionist went home, he swiped my resume and got my cell off the submission to his company since he knew I applied and was so excited to potentially work with me. 

Needless to say, I blocked him and called the company to report him - only caught his name by the card he used to pay for his gross double redbull drink. They were happy that I called and shocked that was the case. He stopped coming to my stand after then and I quit shortly after for a much better job. 

I know this isn‚Äôt as creepy as others on here, but it was creepy at the time, being a 20 yo trying to figure life out and working at a stand alone on a highway. Things can get creepy and people crossing boundaries thinking it‚Äôs okay is something I just can‚Äôt comprehend. 

TY for reading if you made it this far!!!

If swiping through Bumble is working, I wouldn‚Äôt be writing this. 

I badly wanna retire from short-term dating, empty talking stages, and intimacy without commitment. They say if we force the spark, it fades but if we build the fire slowly, it lasts. So why not take a step back and start with solid friendship first? Maybe love starts with a slow burn, not a firework show.

Possible set-up:
- I‚Äôll accompany you and keep you entertained on your PMS/Carwash days, but you‚Äôll take me to Makati for my burger fix when the 10PM cravings hit
- I‚Äôll watch your football games with you, you‚Äôll watch my F1 races with me while drinking beer and munching on fries (Watchparties!!!)
- We can run errands together: groceries, dog food restocks, haircuts, you name it!
- We‚Äôll share hobbies: golfing for you? painting and reading for me? you name it! I‚Äôll be your kaladkarin buddy
- We can go clubbing together: we‚Äôll drink and dance, and no making-out involved

- Single

So my first three books I've written to market, rapid release and playing into semi-spice, instalove, and funny banter. Tropes, mountain men, etc. So far I've found success and quite good reviews and feedback.
But in my heart, I have a passion for literature... I love a well-executed thought, random conclusions, leaning on the absurdities. I've studied English and read most of the classics, so I really have a deep love and appreciation for literature. 

I'm NOT saying my writing is anywhere near good or like classic writers, but I just enjoy it so much. And that's the point, right?

So I've written a short story, about 18,000 words, stand-alone.
The title is Summer & Fainting Goats - A tale of romance, but even the cover is really random.

The point is, maybe I won't make a fortune from this book, maybe no one will understand my particular humor... but maybe there will be a few people who really enjoy and appreciate my work.
Sometimes, between the hustle, we should remember why we do this, where our passion lies, and write the damn book of our hearts.

Here's a little excerpt from the book if you want you can read it and tell me if you found it entertaining:
~~~
She looked at me dead serious, eyes stormy, as if I‚Äôd done something unforgivable. Then she said, ‚ÄúThere is no escaping destiny,‚Äù and waved a rusty screw in the air like it was supposed to mean something.

‚ÄúThroughout my whole life, my mother‚Äôs family always spoke in hushed tones about the Great Screw Moment, and this is it‚Äîit finally came for me. It is my time!‚Äù And then a huge smile formed on her already magnificent face.

I knew she was about to get lost in one of her destiny speeches, but I was standing there, dripping and barely clothed, putting us both in a very vulnerable position.

I put up a hand to stop her mid-speech. ‚ÄúJamie, there is nothing on Earth I could want more than to listen to your reasoning about the magnificence of a screw and how deeply indebted your family is to all screws that have ever existed, but, alas, I must first get decent. Why don‚Äôt you make us a cup of coffee, and then we can discuss this further on the porch with Waffles as a witness?‚Äù

At this point, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that it‚Äôs best to play along, because showing resistance might make her so upset she would pack up and leave‚Äîand that would put us both in dire straits.

When I‚Äôm clothed and mentally prepared for whatever she‚Äôs going to tell me now, I join her on the porch with a steaming mug of coffee.

‚ÄúThanks for the coffee. It‚Äôs delicious,‚Äù I say, plastering the biggest smile I can muster on my face.

She rolls the screw between her thumb and index finger, her eyes glossed over, a tiny smirk on her face.

I place a hand on hers, the one holding the mug, and carefully draw her attention back to me.

She registers my presence and then starts to speak, full of enthusiasm.

‚ÄúMy mother died when I was just a little girl, and my grandparents always said she never had her screw moment. How tragic that must be.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, you have to first tell me what a screw moment is,‚Äù I pry.

‚ÄúOh, a screw moment is one of the biggest moments in a Johnson‚Äôs life. It‚Äôs the moment you know your destiny is upon you. It‚Äôs the moment you step into what you were sent here on Earth to do.

‚ÄúYou see, it all started with great-great-great-grandfather Nicholas Johnson. When he was a little boy, they were very poor. They lived on a farm near Charleston. Then the Great War came, and there was an army training camp nearby. Great-great-great-grandfather Nicholas climbed up a tree to see the troops march through the town one day. The whole surrounding area came to see the big event.

‚ÄúBut Nicholas was always busy with tiny little things. Great-great-great-great-grandmother always scolded him for getting distracted by small, unimportant details and missing the big picture. He would always say, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs the small things that keep the world together.‚Äô Then she‚Äôd whack his head and tell him to go keep himself busy.

‚ÄúBut on this day, he saw the small things again. He saw the beautiful carriage that Corporal Smith was riding in, the fine leather reins of his horse, the cold embroidery on the corporal‚Äôs uniform, and the way the corporal‚Äôs shoes were so polished they almost hurt his eyes to look at.

‚ÄúWhat he also saw was a screw‚Äîa screw that was loose on the spike of the carriage wheel. In that instant, he knew nobody else cared about the small things and that he was the only one who could save the corporal from falling and possibly breaking his neck, which could have meant America would lose a hero and Russia would win the war.

‚ÄúHe jumped off the tree, ran to the carriage, and stopped it by throwing a fig in front of the horses, because he‚Äôd heard horses are afraid of mice, and a fig looks very close to a mouse.

‚ÄúThe horse whinnied and stopped. By that time, Nicholas was already next to the corporal. With a grand gesture, he took off his hat and bowed, because he didn‚Äôt know what else to do in front of greatness.

‚ÄúThe corporal asked, ‚ÄòWhat is it, boy?‚Äô and Nicholas pointed to the screw, which was almost completely unscrewed by that point. It was only moments away from collapse.

‚ÄúThe soldiers quickly fixed the wheel spike and secured the screw. The corporal was so impressed by Nicholas‚Äôs bravery, quick thinking, and attention to detail, they gave him a Medal of Honor. It was his greatest achievement.

‚ÄúFrom that day on, everyone remembered him as the boy with the loose screw.‚Äù",1,1753177260.0,RomanceWriters,0,1.0,False

I'm still trying to land on a good middle of the road bean to use at home, and everything I have learned (and am continuing to learn) is that the machine should be adjusted depending on the beans to maximise their flavour. 

I have experimented with a few different brands, and different settings for each bean to ""dial in"" the right settings.

But.. 

The more I read, the more I test, and the more I taste, the more I realise that I can barely taste a discernible difference between all the settings, especially because I like a good milky brew that covers a lot nuances between each setting. That's before playing around with manually pulling each brew over the automatic settings. 

If you use this machine, have you found a successful ""one setting suits most"" option for your daily brew? One that you can just set up and use for most beans out there? What grind size, manual grind and pull, or dose size and manual pull time?

I‚Äôm working on scraping text data into JSON for a directory site I am building.

Initially, I used an Cursor agent with Playwright MCP). It worked well for about a page and a half of data‚Äîthe scraping completed successfully. But then it suddenly started throwing 404 errors on URLs that I can open perfectly fine in a regular chrome or any other browser.

To troubleshoot, I wrote my own Playwright script from scratch and explicitly configured it to open the *actual* Chrome browser on my system (not the default Chromium or Edge Playwright opens by default). Despite this, I still get the same 404 errors when visiting the URLs programmatically, whereas they load fine when I open them manually. The 404 it was throwing still had the website, presumably wordpress or something,  css as opposed to the chrome developer error page.

When I used cursor with the MCP I got ‚Äúunsupported command-line flag --no-sandbox. Stability and security will suffer‚Äù banner in the chrome browser. At least the the script doesn't give this error in either the chromium browser (blue chrome logo in taskbar) or when I made it use normal chrome.

It's a coffee recipe website I am scraping. It can open the page of recipes page fine ie [https://example.com/blogs/recipes-1](https://example.com/blogs/recipes-1) but it only throws the 404 when it visits or clicks the url of the specific recipe page in that.

I then resorted to Firecrawl MCP agent with Cursor‚Äîand on the same data and URLs, it scrapes perfectly fine without any 404 errors or issues.

This makes me think that **the common factor causing these persistent 404s is Playwright itself** or its specific way of launching and interacting with pages.

My current theory is that either:

* Some stateful thing like session cookies, auth tokens, or browser fingerprinting that Playwright isn‚Äôt replicating fully is required to avoid those 404s, or
* Some subtle difference in how Playwright triggers requests or handles headers is causing the server to block or reject automated access with a 404 status.

Has anyone else encountered a scenario where Playwright-based scraping initially works but then suddenly returns 404 errors on pages still accessible manually? Or where switching to a different scraping engine (not Playwright) fixes these issues entirely?

Any advice on how to debug or work around this kind of 404 behavior, especially when scraping text data to JSON, would be greatly appreciated!

If you're looking for professional carpet cleaning in Auburn, AL, you've come to the right place. Whether you're dealing with pet stains, high-traffic wear, or just routine maintenance, finding a reliable service is key to keeping your carpets fresh and spotless.

# Why Carpet Cleaning Is Essential for Auburn Homes and Businesses

Auburn‚Äôs warm climate, combined with seasonal pollen, dust, and southern red clay, means carpets in the area are prone to absorbing all kinds of dirt and allergens. Even regular vacuuming won‚Äôt reach the deep-set grime and bacteria that collect over time. Here are a few reasons why investing in professional carpet cleaning matters:

# 1. Improves Indoor Air Quality

Carpets act as air filters, trapping dust, allergens, and pollutants. Over time, without deep cleaning, these particles accumulate and can circulate through your home, triggering allergies and respiratory issues. A professional carpet cleaning removes those deep-seated contaminants and purifies your space.

# 2. Extends Carpet Life

Replacing carpet is expensive. Routine professional cleaning helps maintain the integrity of the carpet fibers, prevents matting, and extends the lifespan of your flooring investment.

# 3. Removes Stains and Odors

Whether it‚Äôs spilled coffee, muddy shoes, or pet accidents, stains can be stubborn. Professionals use specialized equipment and solutions that penetrate the carpet backing, not just surface-level, to remove odors and stains completely.

# 4. Enhances Appearance

Clean carpets brighten up a room and make your entire home or office look better maintained and more welcoming.

# How Often Should You Get Carpets Cleaned in Auburn?

How frequently you need professional carpet cleaning depends on your lifestyle. For Auburn households, here‚Äôs a general guide:

* **Every 6‚Äì12 months** for homes with pets or children
* **Every 12‚Äì18 months** for homes with light foot traffic
* **Quarterly or semi-annually** for high-traffic commercial properties  

The climate and soil conditions in Alabama can introduce more dirt and allergens into the home than other regions, so being proactive about your cleaning schedule is crucial.

# Tips to Keep Your Carpets Cleaner Between Professional Visits

Even with regular professional cleaning, keeping your carpet clean daily is important. Here are some expert tips:

# 1. Vacuum Regularly

Aim to vacuum high-traffic areas 2‚Äì3 times a week and the rest at least once a week.

# 2. Use Rugs and Mats

Placing rugs at entry points helps trap dirt and reduces the amount of debris that reaches your carpet.

# 3. Clean Spills Immediately

Blot (don‚Äôt rub) spills as soon as they happen using a clean cloth and cold water. If needed, use a gentle cleaning solution.

# 4. Remove Shoes Indoors

Shoes track in dirt, bacteria, and even pesticides. Having a shoe-free policy indoors can significantly reduce carpet soiling.

# 5. Groom Pets Regularly

Pets shed dander and hair, which gets embedded in carpet fibers. Regular grooming and vacuuming help reduce this.

I‚Äôve only told one person about it. A therapist. I‚Äôve been divorced since December. I was emotionally and mentally neglected and manipulated for 7 years.

To start, I met my ex in 16. It was a year after I graduated high school and I was not in a good place. I was a driver and bodyguard for some drug dealers. We met on a dating site, and she was initially into me for my height. We decided to be friends with benefits at first, but after the first hookup, I caught feelings. I had never been in a real relationship. No one had given me a chance. I was tall but I was heavy set for high school. Went on date with one girl that I liked, and she admitted to liking my twin brother. A common thing. But back to before. We started to date, my ex and I. She lived 40 minutes away from me. We both lived with our families. I constantly drove to pick her up and bring her back to my families house. She didn‚Äôt like driving all that way. She would say her tires weren‚Äôt good. Got her new tires through my job. Said her car battery was bad. Helped her buy a new battery. Tried to do it, but I didn‚Äôt know how to then. Took it someplace and they dropped it in for us. Not long after we started dating, she convinced me to quit my job. I made good money and I loved the work. She convinced me that I deserved more money and they were overworking me. I did work a lot, but I loved the work. The real problem was I had a female manager. She was jealous of all women. She had been cheated on in the past, so she didn‚Äôt trust her partners or other women. I didn‚Äôt quit at first but not long after, she stayed the night. I had work the next morning and she turned off my alarm during the night. I woke up an hour late for work. She told me she had turned it off and I should just quit. So I did. Got a new job. Got paid much less. A couple months of that, and my transmission on my hand-me-down car died. Decided to get a new car. Father said he would co-sign. Ex came with, and decided the car I should get. It wasn‚Äôt what I wanted, but she decided that it would be good for ‚Äúcar seats when we have kids.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt fit in well because of my size, but I went with it. Tried to give it a name, a feminine name, and she turned it down. My car had to have a boy name. I ignored her and called it ‚ÄúDonna‚Äù. Not too long after that, I was fired. Took a part time job. At four months together, she suggested we move into an apartment together. My parents thought it was too soon. I did not heed their advice, and we found an apartment. The apartment was 15 minutes from where she was living and 50 minutes from where I was. I wanted to find something half way. She said no, because it was close to her job, and she didn‚Äôt want to be far from her friends. But it was an hour from my job and I wasn‚Äôt going to be close to my friends. When I mentioned this, she said my new car has better gas mileage and I can find new friends. So I abandoned my friends and moved to the apartment. Then the cheating allegations started. She went through my phone while I slept. Saw dms I had while I was in high school or after. She was the only one I had been talking to since we started talking. She monitored my phone every day, my social media too. I could only post approved pictures and they had to put her in good light. I got a new job not too far away and her first concern was if I‚Äôd be working near any women. Now, she could have male friends and coworkers. She had three male best friends. Two were gay and the other was trans male. I couldn‚Äôt have female friends. I should ‚Äúfight‚Äù any female coworkers. I had tried to go to school two times by then. She had been supportive, up until I was about to start college when she would convince me not to. Money, eventual kids, me being near women. This continued for years. Then her love became conditional. She hated my love languages and would show me love when I showed her love the way she wanted it. I was all about physical touch, gift giving, and words of affirmation. She liked gift giving, but wanted quality time. The quality time was only there when I wanted to do something by myself. I want to play video games; no we should watch a twitch stream of a game she likes. I want to watch this anime from where I‚Äôm at; no start it over from beginning, or put this show on for us. I only got personal time while I was at work. I was the breadwinner, I worked full time and made more. Now if I wanted to spend quality time with her while she was doing her own things, she would tell me no and to leave her alone. But I had to watch her stream her video games. Then I found Discord. Made friends in servers. She hated that. Checked my phone on every server every day and accused me of cheating even more. She hadn‚Äôt approved my new friends. So I had to constantly promote her streaming and talk about her anytime I could. I did anyway, because I loved her. On long stretch of her not giving me love, even if I was bringing home coffee and snacks for her after work every day, I messaged a woman to talk. The only way I could, was to start vaping again. She forced me to quit, since the smell made her sick. I vaped in the garage. I was constantly vaping for hours just to talk to people and new friends. She found out rather quick. She was very mad. I slept on a cot in a different room for a week. Then she told me that if never do it again I could sleep in the bedroom. I agreed. Then we got married. I bought a tailored blazer, she bought a white dress on Amazon. She returned it the day after. A quick side note, my ex is child of divorce and thought marriage was dumb. She got married to me because her grandparents promised to buy her a car as a wedding present. They offered her more if she gave them a great grandchild. Luckily for me, due to genetic condition passed down, I‚Äôm essentially infertile. I wanted kids at first, but not anymore. After we got married, everything stayed the same. Except I could never take my ring off and demanded I consistently post wedding photos. Wedding photos were only pictures she liked and approved of. She never wore her ring. I became numb to everything being the same. The intimacy was gone. I eventually realized that she would never love me as I loved her. I cheated again. I bought nudes through Discord. She found out and gave me an ultimatum. Disable my Discord or divorce. I gave up discord but gave my friend my email. We kept in touch. My discord friend was the only friend I had during the last leg of my marriage. I started seeing a psychiatrist to become a better husband. I believed I was the problem. My ex believed it to. She believed that nothing was wrong with her, and she didn‚Äôt need therapy. My sessions helped change my perceptions, and ideals. My psychiatrist recommended I see a couples counselor with my ex. I set up an appointment with them. I told my ex about it and she said she didn‚Äôt need therapy. I had the problem and she didn‚Äôt. I convinced her, with the promise of going out for breakfast and lunch. On our way there, she said she wanted a divorce. She appreciated me going to therapy, but didn‚Äôt think I would change in the manner I did. We made it to the couples therapist and told her of the divorce and left. My ex told me, I was always a better friend than a husband. Told me we could be best friends now. I wanted to kill myself. I had done everything for her, just to be her friend. I was lost, I cried every night, I lost my job. She was happy. I established full contact with my friend and got back on Discord. After separating our home into different parts, I decided to go out for a hookup. I found out, the semi hard way, I had developed ED due to anxiety. I got diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. While living there, separated, I began talking to my friend in a flirty way. We decided to meet up in person. We started to date. I decided to move in with my parents again. My ex begged and cried for me to stay. She couldn‚Äôt cover the bills by herself, and we could lose our friendship if I left. I moved out anyway. Deciding that I would have nothing to do with her, unless I had to. I spent a lot of time with my new girlfriend, and she cared for me. It was so different from my ex. It was beautiful and magical. It was difficult not to fall in love with my girlfriend. Then December had it. My ex and I were separated for 6 months, everything ‚Äúdivided‚Äù, I just let her have what she wanted. No lawyers. It got finalized by a judge. It was over. My family and friends told me how much they hated my ex. My family told me she had a group chat with them, without me, to tell them how horrible I was. They never believed her. My mom still tells me she would fight her.

Now, I am still with girlfriend. We live together. She loves me like nothing I‚Äôve ever felt. It‚Äôs unconditional, and it makes me still tear up when I think about it. We have the same love languages, she has unwavering support in me. She is everything I deserved and needed. I am the same too with her. But I‚Äôm not completely healed from everything. I‚Äôm still nervous and anxious around women. I still have some ED. I still vape. I still feel like if she hit that‚Äôd be okay, I probably deserve it. I still flinch at being touched. My girlfriend would never hurt me. She‚Äôs gentle with me. 

I am loved in every way that I‚Äôve needed. I am happy. Even when we aren‚Äôt being treated right by someone we love, there is someone out there who will love you in every way you need and deserve. If I had to do everything all over again, I would. Take the same steps back to where I am. 

(PS: I did have a story about my ex. At one of my jobs, a female coworker of mine was sexually assaulted by two male coworkers. I was on lunch at the time. I told my ex about it. She said my coworker deserved it. Being a female in a male dominated job. I got so mad at her. No one deserves that.)",2,1753176248.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False

My wife and I finally managed to move out of my dad's house and buy a 4 bed forever home, we pick up keys on 30th and will move on that evening and have the day off to finish moving on the 31st.

We rented a 2 bed flat before so have a double mattress, single mattress (in storage), bedding, kitchen stuff and clothes, and a sideboard and coffee table.

We're trying to get ahead of the game on making moving as efficiently as possible as both of our jobs are international project based with travel everywhere, and with current projects we only have that one day (Thursday) off to move out and in, and back to work Friday.

We've got a whole bunch of stuff being delivered as we got a crap ton of deals during prime week (appliances and kitchen gadgets are covered). We don't have much stuff so got a cousin with a van to take our minimal possessions over, and will slum in on the mattresses and shop for sofas and bedframes once in.

We've forward dated virgin package, water, energy and council tax for the move in date. But would appreciate the collective wisdom of the thread on what we can do to make the initial move easier (should we get a professional deep clean?!) or wisdom on going about furnishing and filling the house from mattress on the floor to lovely furnished home!

Thanks so much in advance.",2,1753176086.0,HousingUK,1,1.0,False

In the desert of Lindsahr, under the scorching glare of an angry, red sun, the sands shifted beneath Nimrod's feet. It was the alarm, but out of time.
He grabbed his spear and bag of poisons, wrapped the old, torn cloth around his head and face, and set towards the movement.
The heat was unbearable, as searing as any open flame, but constant, unyielding to wind and never out of kindling.
""Gods dammit, why are they shifting now? What's wrong with these things?"" He hated the day, but keeping sandworm patterns required following their schedule, and recently, they'd been all out of whack.
He passed his hand along his chin, stubble lightly scratching his fingers. ""I don't like this; the trails are uneven, scattered, like they don't know where they're going."" He tried to understand the recent change, but nothing lined up on the timeline, nothing except...
His gaze turned to the horizon, to the desert's edge, closer by the day. There, the sands slowly gave way, replaced by fertile blood soil. Most people cherished it, but Nimrod felt.. differently. He'd, of course, eaten from those fields; hell, he'd cried his eyes out at being full for the first time...

 But the desert was dying, a part of them was dying. Could the others not see it?
He trekked back to his tribe. Well, it was a village now. They had enough food for it, and wood.

 ""Gods, I don't think I'll ever get used to these creaky things,"" he complained as he dragged his feet across the floorboards.  Inside a small room, well-lit by candles and marked by strewn maps across the small table and floor, he found a familiar scene: Kalil, she was hunched over the maps, dusty glasses upon her pointy nose, tongue slipping out as she analyzed the maps with the intensity of a grandmother checking a shirt for stains.
Nimrod smiled, sneaked up on her, and tapped her shoulder lightly. ""I'm back. Found anything good?"" Kalil jumped like a startled cat. ""DON'T!..."" 

"" Oh, it's you, Nimrod. Sorry, I've just been locked on these tracks you mapped. I can't for the life of me understand them. It's like we're not looking at the same creatures anymore."" Her gaze turned to the small, curtained window, a small cloud in the distance, under the always watching blue sky. ""No surfacings yet either, I assume?""
""No,"" he shook his head.
Kalil replied, ""So getting one's still impossible. God, how am I supposed to do my job without a specimen? I'm a cataloguer by her sake! Ughh!""

 She threw her hands up wildly, knocking over papers and a cup of the Empire's new commodity.

Nimrod chuckled, picked up the papers and mug, and kissed her head. ""You'll figure it out. If not, then even the moon couldn't answer."" He nestled her hair. ""Got to get some sleep, okay? You've been at it for two days now. I don't think this coffee thing's good for you."" 

""It keeps me up. And I need to think. If we don't figure this out, the whole desert could...""

""Shhh, I know, but a brain on fumes is good for no one,"" he said, quoting her own words.

She finally relented, and both headed off to the strange new framed bed at their ""house."" God, that'd take some getting used to, thoughts in unison.


Nimrod turned in bed, dreams filled with images of twisting sands and dark shadows. Beside him, Kalil seemed deep asleep, exhaustion finally catching up to her.

He stirred a bit more until deciding to get up; sleep wasn't any good right now, and he could go over today's charts again. He made his way down the corridor, but when he touched the handle, his feet trembled. He felt a familiar shiver, and smiled.

Not long after, the alarm system confirmed his thoughts. The rocks attached to ropes in the underground openings started rattling. A worm, a big one by the sounds of it.

Nimrod quickly turned it off before Kalil could hear it. What better gift than a worm and breakfast in bed? He made his way outside, then he stood at the center of a clearing in the sands, and started stomping.

""Tu. Tututu.tutu.tu.""

Seconds of silence, then, the sand under him shifted, mounds rising and falling like angry waves in a granular sea. In what felt like an instant, it emerged.
Nimrod smiled, at least until he took a look at it. His knees shook for the first time since he was a child lost in the night desert, and that had been from cold.

Before him stood the biggest... worm? He ever saw. Easily seven palm trees high, but instead of the tanned creature he expected, it was pale, almost translucent. Inside its see-through body, dark veins pulsed ominously. Its mouth, now a gaping hole of darkness, had no teeth in sight, and the most disturbing part: at its bottom, sewn in like some shaman's twisted joke, were hundreds of... spider legs? Nimrod recognized them. Dune horrors, but never left their sand dungeons, waiting to snap whatever came up.

""None of this makes sense!"" He ran inside to wake up Kalil; he needed help. But before he could reach her, an inhuman screech blasted through his chest. He actually lost his footing for a moment, ears ringing. When he looked behind, he lost all color.

In a wave of horrible, unnatural movement, the segmented worm body pushed itself forward while the spider legs tried wildly to rule their actions. And it was coming, too fast. The void-like mouth was right on top of him. The rotten meat smell he had come to expect was gone, replaced by the light, sickly-sweet smell of the Empire's new fruits. 

Nimrod braced for the worst, his eyes shutting so his last thought would be Kalil, but then... he felt it, right under his elbow. A rope.

Nimrod pulled on it, hard. The base of the observatory tower shrieked and tumbled on top of him and the worm, straw and dry wood burying the two.

The worm thrashed and squirmed; it was a matter of time before it found its way out. Among the wood cracking and tumbling, Nimrod heard her. 

""Nim! Where are you! Moon damn you, answer me!"" Her voice was angry, slightly desperate but trying to keep it together. He smiled, she sounded like she did in their first visit to the capital.  
 
Nimrod screamed, ""The tower, Kalil! It's no worm, it's a monster! I got it trapped but not for long!""
He looked at her through the debris. She scouted for him, and the shine of his emerald eyes in the moonlight drew her in. In that moment, he smiled, and said, ""love you Evelilly"" 

Nimrod then struggled through the wood to reach his pocket, to reach his flint and steel. Kalil noticed; the worm started getting itself through the debris. Twisting, angry spider legs poking through the holes, pushing the giant worm body up. The structure started crumbling.

A giant piece of a cracked beam bore down upon Nimrod. He tried to roll to the side, but he didn't have room. The javelin-like dry wood stabbed through his shoulder. He cried in pain, his hand opened, and his flint fell through the cracks.

""Fuck!"" he thought. There was only one way now, and he hated it. ""Kalil, do it. Please!""

He stared through the crack. He couldn't hear her clearly anymore. Her eyes were filled with tears thicker than scorpion's blood; her words reached him in chunks.

""What?... idiot....can't I...you too...""

Then, a flicker in her hand. She turned away. Nimrod smiled. There was blinding light, and darkness. ",1,1753175884.0,writingfeedback,0,1.0,False

The Child We Unmade

by Ahmad Gul

A child plays in his backyard,
barefoot, laughing,
his pockets full of pebbles
and the unspoken names of friends
who will not stay.

He doesn‚Äôt know what a border is.
He doesn‚Äôt know
that his best friend‚Äôs name
curdles like milk
in another‚Äôs mouth.

He grows.

School divides the world
into rows of desks,
then rows of the worthy and the wept-for.

At first, he only sees faces‚Äî
Aarav‚Äôs missing tooth,
Samira‚Äôs braid,
the crescent scar on Elias‚Äô knee.

Then the lessons begin:
The map bleeds new lines overnight.
‚ÄúProgress,‚Äù the teacher says,
her pointer tapping the scars of nations.
At home, his father stirs sugar into tea‚Äî
the same way ‚Äúthose people‚Äù do‚Äî
and whispers,
‚ÄúNever trust a tongue
that licks the same spoon but prays sideways.‚Äù

He learns to measure:
caste by the starch of a collar,
faith by the twitch of a wrist,
love by how a flag dyes the sky.

One day, he blots out Aisha‚Äôs name
like a mistake in a holy book.
He tells himself it‚Äôs just ink.

He grows older.

The anthem cracks the air.
His chest swells with its fever.
The news unspools its red script.
His fists learn their algebra.

When the bombs fall, he calls it ‚Äúa correction.‚Äù
When the bodies are shown, he says,
‚ÄúSee how they fold? Like bad origami.‚Äù

The child who once split his mango
with the beggar‚Äôs son
now splitscreens memes of cleansing
between coffee sips.

And you‚Äî
you who swallowed your tongue
when they joked about ‚Äúthose animals,‚Äù
you who let the textbook‚Äôs lies
ferment into facts,
you who stepped over blood
to keep your shoes clean‚Äî

tell me:
Was his hate a seed in the soil,
or did you water it every time
you chose the weight of silence
over the risk of sound?

This creep still approached me.,"Sitting in an all night coffee shop, clearly minding my own business. EarPods in, face buried in my screen. I can FEEL this guy staring at me. Then doing circles around the area I‚Äôm sitting in. I ignore him completely, make sure I don‚Äôt accidentally look at him.

Doesn‚Äôt stop this guy. Stops to stand right next to my seat and just starts talking. Fine. I inwardly sigh and pull out an EarPod. He repeats himself, asking me a stupid question about my tattoos. What‚Äôs worse, the only one really super visible is on the back of my neck which, for some reason, creeps me out even more.

Disheveled, unkempt, bad teeth, maybe late 20‚Äôs or early 30‚Äôs and a wedding ring on his finger. Even mentions he‚Äôs there picking up a drink for his wife and in my head I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúThen why the fuck are you talking to me?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt say it out loud though, I just want him to get the hint and go away. I answer his questions and even go to put my earbud back in, face to my screen but does this guy take the hint? Of course not, just keeps asking more questions about my tattoos, how many I have, so on.

Now I‚Äôm getting to the point where I want to get up and leave. He‚Äôs setting off my instincts and I‚Äôm fucking uncomfortable. I do not feel safe. But I also know leaving while he‚Äôs anywhere near me is also not a smart idea.

Finally his order is ready. He says goodbye and leaves. And here I am, an hour later, still not sure if I should leave in case he‚Äôs still out there, even though I know he probably isn‚Äôt.

I will definitely be walking to my car with a key between each of my fingers. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs out there, not really, but now I can‚Äôt take that chance.

I don't want to be her friend anymore,"My ‚Äòfriend‚Äô Claire was the first person to introduce themself to me when i moved to my city. I was so flattered and grateful. It turned out she had a sweet little girl in my daughter‚Äôs class, and they lived nearby! I was so happy!

But over time, as we walked to school together every day The conversation was always forced and her answers were flat ‚Äòyeah / no.‚Äô I began to find we didn't really connect.

Over time, Claire would constantly text asking me to have her daughter over, I didn‚Äôt mind at first But she never reciprocated the favour. Plus her daughter was a nightmare to feed so I would have to buy special food in for her.

Not once in 2 years that I‚Äôve known her has she asked me for or offered me out for even a coffee.

When she finally had another baby with a man she had (purposely) fallen pregnant by after dating for 2 weeks I had to have her daughter for 48 hours. I didn‚Äôt want to, but she has 'no one else.'

My kid asks me why Claire never invites us over. I brush it off saying Claire likes her daughter to come to us because we have a bigger garden to play in, but secretly I feel pissed off and USED.

Recently I‚Äôve been unwell so my other half has been doing the school run. But for the last day of term, I joined him and went to school.

As soon as Claire saw me she ran over and burst into tears apologising for her baby daddy‚Äôs behaviour and if he was ever rude to me. But he never was, genuinely I was just unwell.

As she was in such a state I asked her to join us for a bbq that evening as she clearly needed cheering up. When she was there she told us all about the trouble with the baby daddy and how the police came and took him away. I listened patiently and offered comfort. I was relieved when she finally left as she has put a downer on everything that night.

The next day I got a text from her, I thought oh nice! She‚Äôs going to thank me for last night! (Not to mention all the free booze and food she consumed, she didn‚Äôt even bring food for her kid and baby - muggins here had to supply it all).

Well, I was wrong. ‚ÄòMy daughter wants a play date with your daughter.‚Äô There wasn‚Äôt even a fucking ‚Äòplease‚Äô or thank you! Just a manipulative message asking me to have her kid at my house AGAIN!!! I say manipulative as she always has a way of phrasing it so that if I say no, I‚Äôm saying no directly to her sweet little girl.

Call it a death by a thousand cuts or the straw that broke the camels back but I think I am done with this one way friendship. I get she‚Äôs having a hard time but I feel like she drags me down and uses me because I have a steady home and a husband, and I‚Äôm convenient to dump her kid on.

I 30 M, am an immigrant in Europe. I met my current long distance gf in August 2022, and we started dating in October, we live like 120 km apart in neighboring countries. We met on Tinder and we were friends at the beginning and then i asked her out and we have been in a relationship since Nov 2022.  I want to describe the problems i have and i am desperate to find a solution to this. 

I was working in the IT tech sector and was laid off recently. She was born in Eastern Europe and has lived there pretty much all her life. She was previously married, but divorced due to her husband's fault , not hers. She worked as a freelancer from home and recently got a job that allows full time work from home. 

When we started dating, i had saved up some money for some nice spendings like dinners and so on, and i was happy to pay initially, but when we were in a relationship, i expected to split the bills, as i am starting my life in europe and need to build my wealth as the currency of the country i come from would make me a nobody here. I have 2 parents, both 65+ of age with medical complications. They have insurance covering their medical bills, to a certain extent, but the rest i need to support. 

I will inherit pretty much nothing from my parents, so i need to build my wealth to give my self the future i want. However, my gf was adamant in the saying "" I am not saving money other than my emergency expenses of 6 months. as we have not agreed on what we are saving towards"" This was a big blow to me, as houses in europe are like bare minimum 200k+. this is not factoring into emergency gadget expenses, travel, food, medicine, job loss, deaths etc. She wanted to have a house with a garden and a dog and a cat , with a car, a typical american dream, albeit, european dream. 

I have no issues with this, and she deserves the world. But I think it is fair of me to ask to do her fair share of it as well. I have about 5 years left till i can apply for citizenship, and then buying property is much more safer for me. But a person in 2025, by themselves, cannot afford to buy any property unless, they are inheriting it or a crazy tech bro or having a business or something like that. 

Not only property, wishing for a car, vacations, trips in nature, maintenance of said car, having a garden implies maintenance, having a dog / cat implies medical bills and food bills, all of this needs to be factored in and still says that there is no goal that we agreed on so i am not saving. 

I asked her to find a job in my city so we can move in together. it has been 1.5 years, and despite having a knowledge of the language of my country where i reside, she keeps deflecting with so many excuses like ,i am not confident in my ability to speak said language, i dont want to go to an office, i dont want to be around people, i dont want to be in urban areas, i want to be in nature, etc etc etc. 

Her income allows her to stay afloat, with zero net increase in her wealth over the course of the last 2 years almost, and bringing her savings down to 50% of what it was. I did everything i could, as ked her to do a course for her career shift , as she was thinking that AI might derail her career. I asked her to apply for financial aid in coursera to do a course, which she said she will pay because "" it is too complicated"" and ended up doing a 60 hour course over the course of 8 months, and then complaining she lost money because the only reason that she is moving cities is for me. 

Wanting a good life , but zero movements towards it. I , on the other hand , worked my ass off, and will have around 100,400 Euros at the end of september , give or take 200 euros. This is living well below my means, not taking major vacations, no bars, clubs, supermarket discounts, saving aggresively, investing, all the while sending money to my parents when they need it. I have seen my mother go 2 meals a day JUST to make sure i had money for my education. So yeah i think they deserve to live life stress free for the last few years of their life. 

Now i am not saying she should have the same amount. But i dont see any steps taken towards the right direction. Every topic i bring up - it is complicated, it is exhausting, i dont like it, i dont want to do it, all the while romanticizing a dream that she will NEVER achieve on her own and likely we cannot do it together as well. Based on her salary now, it will take her a year, to save her 6 months emergency savings and THEN only start saving towards anything she wants.   
  
If i talk about increasing her income she equates it to more working hours, even for the shorter duration and says i am prioritizing my health and time over this. Her prioritization is sitting and listening to podcasts about health, mental awareness, psychology , nutrition for hours. how to think successful and so on. This also gives her the ability to constantly quote the podcasters and tell me that i am not living my life properly. I am a olympic weightlifter, amateur who is training 4 times a week, for the last 3 years. i eat clean 70% of the time and on weekends i like to have some chips or pizza or something of that sort.   
  
She hates it , but at the same time loves coffee, cheesecake , crossaints etc in cafes. Yet demonizes carbs when i eat them . She is prediabetic and blames me for feeding her sweets, when we were dating and i was bringing her green tea in cans which were sweetened and she was drinking 3 cans a day that equated to 45 grams of sugar. She is against all processed food, including airfryers , microwaves , frozen veggies, despite evidence proving otherwise. i cant have a rational conversation with her even once, as she spirals into , i dont want to do this and thats it.  I asked her to eat good protein and exercise, as she must do it to take care of her health and these are basics and she uses them as an excuse to advice me on fringe topics like 20 minutes of sunlight a day and so on. i dont have time to sit on the sun and do nothing. i walk to my office and get the sunlight i need in the meanwhile.   
  
She is extremely controlling about how much butter i use when i am at her place, how i shower, how much water i use to wash the dishes, all these tiny little things. She needs to go to bed at sharp 9.00 PM otherwise she has migranes and wakes up whenever she wants, say 7 - 8 am. But on the days she wants, to watch something, she will go to bed as late as she wants.   
  
She gets angry over the tiniest of things and does not take into context of what happens. Like she hates when i dont pay attention to her on video calls, and she spirals quickly, even though i was reading a message from her that popped up on my screen. Nothing bad happened. she CHOSE to be angry. 

I dont want simple emotional support from my partner, it feels like i am dragging her through life, and in this dragging i am losing myself and my potential to live my dreams. I understand, to a certain extent the complex economics that are shaping the world today for all of us and i am doing my very best to protect me and the people around me. It feels like she constantly views me as a villian. 

I dont know how to deal with this.

I just moved into this apartment (photos below) and I could really use some help figuring out how to decorate it. I‚Äôm not set on any particular style. Honestly, I‚Äôm open to anything as long as it looks good and feels kinda balanced.

So far I‚Äôve got:
a small beige (almost white) sofa
a small orange pouf
and a TV

That‚Äôs it for now.
I was thinking of going with the usual setup, like a TV stand, coffee table, dining table and chairs, but if someone has a better idea I‚Äôm totally open. I just want something that makes sense visually and feels nice to be in.

I‚Äôm mostly not sure what kind of furniture to go for, like color-wise or style-wise. Especially with the TV stand and the dining table. The floor is a dark wood-like material and I don‚Äôt know if I can add more wood without it clashing or feeling too heavy. Should I go with a different material altogether? Or is there a wood tone that could work well with it?

Recently engaged (wohoo!) and attended a pre-wedding course with my partner. It was required but ended up being quite helpful. Really liked one of the exercises where we had to express appreciation for each other ‚Äî it was simple, but surprisingly powerful.

It got me thinking...

I'm exploring the idea of building a **shared gratitude journal app for couples**.  
Each partner writes one thing they‚Äôre grateful for about the other, every day.  
Once both submit, the entries unlock ‚Äî so you both get to read what the other wrote.

It‚Äôs private, simple, and designed to bring couples closer through daily appreciation.

Would you use something like this with your partner? Open to thoughts and feedback üôè

1m68x8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m68x8w/choosing_myself_he_ended_our_5year_relationship/,Choosing Myself: He ended our 5-year relationship out of nowhere and left me to deal with everything,"My ex (42M) and I (40F) had been together for 5 years. Two months ago, we moved into a new house together. We shared a life, a home and a dog. I thought we were working on aligning our future goals and that we were in it together. I had supported him during his studies and it was finally my turn... Now I'm left trying to figure out how to recalibrate.   
Don't worry - I am in therapy and even though I thought I had been very adept at working on relational self-awareness. I am putting my *emotional* needs first for a change. I know things weren't always perfect but we were a stellar team. I've started realising just how much of the emotional heavy-lifting I had been doing. 

Last Friday morning, while having our usual morning coffee in bed, he calmly said: *‚ÄúWe need to break up.‚Äù* Within 24 hours, he packed his bags and left. Not just the house, he left the country.  
For clarity: we were living together in my home country but he's from a different one. 

On the practical side: We have a two-month notice period on the lease, so he‚Äôs still legally and financially tied to this place. But since walking out, he‚Äôs pretty much ghosted me. He initially agreed to ‚Äúhave a conversation to honour what we shared.‚Äù When I asked him *when* would suit, he left me on 'read'*.* Month end is looming.

So, here I am, picking up the pieces of a life we built, taking care of our dog (who was also *his* responsibility but he chose to discard), dealing with bills and practical fallout, while he‚Äôs probably living it up, ‚Äúfree‚Äù, single and unbothered. 

I know this man. This is his classic avoidant behavior. I tolerated it for years because I loved him deeply. But I see it for what it is now: cowardice. Selfishness. No real emotional growth. Hurt that he will continue to inflict on others. He was never going to step up. I already know he's the type to ""get over someone by getting under someone"".

I need him to contribute financially for the remainder of the notice period and take some accountability for the commitments he made. Not to me, but to our dog and the house. I don‚Äôt want to be the ‚Äúnagging ex,‚Äù but I refuse to let him dump all of this on me because he wants to live his new single life. 

Part of me still wants to be his friend because he was my confidant and best friend for 5 years. But another part of me is disgusted by how callous and selfish he‚Äôs been. Good riddance to a spineless, selfish person who hurts people when they care about him.

Has anyone been through this? Did you manage to get your ex to take responsibility, or is it better to cut your losses and focus on moving forward?

TL;DR  
My ex (42M) ended our 5-year relationship out of nowhere a week ago, just 2 months after we moved into a new house together. He left the country within 24 hours, ghosted me after promising a conversation and I fear he may avoid his financial and shared responsibilities (dog, lease).

I see that with Ambassador status, repairs are free for me. I think that's really nice. And then I see that they're sending me a new machine, and I think: Perfect. All that money I've spent over the past 5 years will finally be useful to me.

I contact support via chat, and everything goes well. They tell me exactly what I read, and that suits me perfectly.

The next morning, I send the requested information. And then disaster strikes.

The agent behind the chat tells me that my coffee maker model is no longer sold and therefore no longer repairable.  And so they can't send me a new machine.

After several minutes of discussion, I'm unsuccessful. I'm told to buy a new coffee machine.

# üåø Self-Care and HALT

First of all, a note on self-care: in DBT, drug recovery programs, etc., there is an acronym called ""HALT"". This is a useful tool for anyone.

**HALT: [Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired](https://files.catbox.moe/51wku9.png)**

If you feel acutely unwell, halt! Stop and reassess. Check in with yourself. Did you eat a healthy meal? Are you well-hydrated? Did you get enough sleep? Did you seek a positive interaction with people or environment (even if it's something passive like sitting by yourself at a coffee shop or park)?

Give yourself treats, in moderation. Video games, blasting bicep curls or whatever, ice cream or other sweet (or savory) treats, or whatever else. Don't overdo it.

# üå± Trusting the process and grieving a Lost Future

Here's a cliche, but it's true: ""trust the process""

You won't forget them, and will probably think about them again during a ""[dark night of the soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Night_of_the_Soul)"". During these times, you will feel pangs of grief for a lost future, but they will dull over time as your mind fills with new experiences.

For the philosophically inclined, check out the concept of [hauntology](https://old.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/alomyc/what_is_hauntology/effpf1n/). [Here's a video about it explained using the game ""Fallout"" and 80's nostalgia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSvUqhZcbVg)

Do not run from the future you lost, but try to integrate it into your life as a way to move forward. Do not allow the lost future to colonize you and use you to relive itself.

Many people spend some amount of time living in the future, which is also normal: humans are one of the few animals with enough brain capacity to think on very long time scales. When you were with them, you naturally planned for a future, and expected to realize that future as a team. Unfortunately, your teammate turned out to be unreliable and unfit for the task at hand. 

The good news: there are many potential teammates out there who can, and will, enthusiastically join you in your quest.

There are many lost futures in this world, but each day we can make decisions that lead us to new better futures. There is a whole world out there. Billions of people! Billions of futures!

# ‚öì Accountability and Self-Reflection

People with BPD tend to believe that *life happens to them*, because they cannot take accountability for their mistakes nor realize that they are steering the ship that is their life. They cannot tolerate failure or setbacks or self-reflection, but you can. 

Since you're reading this, you already are.

# üåé Re-engaging with life, deprogramming yourself, and rebuilding trust in the world

Fill your mind with new experiences, new people, new interactions. Allow good things to live in your brain. Don't let your ex live in your head ‚Äî they're not contributing anything positive in there (not even paying rent)!

Don't rush into a new relationship ‚Äî a simple friendly interaction with a new friend or a stranger you just met can be one of those new experiences. Maybe a comment here that resonates with you. Keep track of these things and note how you feel as a result.

When separating from my ex, I was basically incapacitated with grief and shock. I reached out to my neighbors asking for help finding a new place to live. These people were almost strangers, but what shocked me was that they were so fucking supportive in a way that the person who called me ""the one"" and ""the love of [their] life"" would not even attempt to do!

Get rid of everything that reminds you of them if possible.

Allow yourself to be out in the world despite your pain. Right now you are raw and in agony. Your emotional skin is still regrowing after being torn off. You will encounter many good people, friendly people, supportive people. Do be careful not to reveal too much, but do notice kindness and accept it.

Being out in the world doesn't even have to be actually outside. [I like co-op online games, for example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdsU6xC3Np8)

Keep seeing friends and staying active, mentally and physically (ideally both). Keep going to the gym if you're into that. 

[Touch grass](https://files.catbox.moe/cnwcnn.jpg). 

Please avoid alcohol and other substances, because they only delay healing.

# üòµ‚Äçüí´ Navigating mental fog as well as the FOG

Right now you're in the thick of it and it's impossible to see what lays ahead because you're surrounded by mental fog and emotional [FOG](https://outofthefog.website/toolbox-1/2015/11/17/fog-fear-obligation-guilt), which is completely normal after what you've experienced.

Be thankful that you have this ability, and realize that you can project your mind into *many alternative futures where you are happy and take action to make them a reality!*

Our former partners cannot do this. They live in a fantasy world that's filled mostly with pain and darkness and fear. They are stuck, often forever chasing a horizon that they believe will heal their core wounds: new relationships, new identities, drugs, etc. It is tragic. You don't have to live like that!

Don't demand this of your mind right now, because it is busy processing trauma, but do try to visualize some blurry futures where you are simply okay.

Think about being [Barry in the pond](https://files.catbox.moe/4rzd2g.jpg). Look at how content he is, just sitting in the water! 

One day you too will be unbothered, moisturized, happy, focused, in your lane, flourishing. It might be by yourself or with someone else.

# üî• Acknowledging Emotions

Allow for anger (to a degree) and other feelings to simply exist. Sit with them, watch them. Anger is a mechanism that exists to protect you, but do not let it consume you. Feel your feelings, acknowledge them, and put them away for a while.

Say to your anger: ""thank you for protecting me from danger. you did your job. good job, anger! the danger is gone now.""

Say to your pain: ""thank you for letting me know something was wrong. good job, pain!""

Say to your grief: ""thank you for reminding me that I was hurt, that I deserve better, and that I was truly invested in my partner. good job, grief!""

Some people like to write unsent letters. Maybe write them down and burn them, or use them for future journaling material.

# üí≠ Handling Rumination

Rumination is also totally normal. You just experienced a deeply traumatic event and are disoriented on many levels. You can imagine it like a car crash (I would actually argue that car crashes are easier mentally, because the circumstances are much simpler to decipher).

Don't let rumination suck you in, but tame it: set aside time to ruminate. Make it a thing on your calendar. If you like to take walks and are stuck on some topics, make a short list of things that you feel compelled to ruminate about, write them down, and actively ruminate while walking. Bring a journal or just some paper or your phone if needed to take notes. After the walk is done, reflect on your ruminations, and write down realizations underneath those bullet points. Then put the journal away for another day.

During the bad moments, get the journal out and re-read your realizations.

You can also choose to sit down and read other people's stories, post your thoughts, and receive support here. After your rumination time is done, close the browser tabs and go focus on something else.

# üß© Understanding (But Not Solving) Their Mind

I'm on the autism spectrum and, stereotypically, an engineer. Something that helps me is figuring out how things work, and in the case of my relationship the thing I wanted to figure out was my ex's mind. Do not attempt to *rationalize* their actions or put yourself in their shoes: it is an impossible task since you do not have this disorder. Be thankful you cannot understand many of the things they did or why.

[The ""why"" is an incomprehensible swirling mess of chaos and pain.](https://earthbound.fandom.com/wiki/Giygas#Personality)

Do not try to solve the puzzle that is them. It is an impossible task and will only drive you mad. They are as they are. Just analyze the behavior like you would an alien mind (because their minds are truly alien to us).

Remember that BPD stems from core wounds. These people hate themselves on a level you cannot imagine. Eventually they project this self-hatred onto you in order to ease their pain. Be thankful that you cannot fully understand.

# üìì Journaling and Pattern Recognition

I journal a lot and try to extract broad patterns from specific events (e.g., ""they did X, which hurt me because [my needs were being ignored/I was not being heard despite doing my best to communicate well/I did not receive a proper apology/There was no behavioral change/There was no accountability]"".

I labeled each event I ruminated about (""lack of accountability"", ""distorted thought patterns"", ""[distorted reality perception](https://old.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1m211zs/reminder_communicate_via_text_archive_everything/)"" etc). Keep track of how many times you encounter each label. You'll eventually start to see trends emerge.

Eventually I was able to write a short list summarizing the major themes of our relationship: repeated broken promises, future faking, ex's emotional dysregulation, neglect of the relationship, self-neglect, neglect of the future we were supposedly building, gaslighting, DARVO, being forced to manage my ex's emotions/life plans/etc, not being heard, being ignored, being abandoned, etc.

# ü™® Releasing responsibility and putting down the impossible weight

I love my ex, but I am thankful the burden has been lifted. I am angry about how they slowly sabotaged the relationship and let it fall apart through inaction and outright refusal to take responsibility for their life and growth as an adult. I am angry and hurt at how they turned me into an evil caricature. I am angry they rewrote reality despite overwhelming evidence.

But then I realize: I know who I am. I know what I did and did not do. I know what I said. I know the reality, and *I have receipts*!

My ex is not my responsibility any more. In fact, they were never my responsibility, but I fell into that role, begged them to not put me or keep me there, but in the end I still became their [pseudo-parent](https://old.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/10u6lpg/is_it_normal_to_feel_like_a_father_figure_to_you/).

Your ex is no longer your responsibility. The relationship is gone. Put that weight down and walk away from it, because it was always an impossible lift.

# üß≠ The power of choices

Every day is an opportunity for choices. Choices build up to outcomes.

Every day my ex woke up with the opportunity to make better choices, including choices that would move the relationship forward, choices that would improve both our lives... but they chose to destroy and neglect me and us until everything broke down. They did not want to grow and actively resisted it. I ended up carrying them far too much.

My choices were: enabling, [JADE](https://outofthefog.website/what-not-to-do-1/2015/12/3/jade-dont-justify-argue-defend-explain), poor boundaries, [overfunctioning](https://dralexandrasolomon.com/disrupting-the-over-functioning-under-functioning-dynamic/), and self-abandonment.

I will not make such choices again, because they lead to annihilation.

Their choices were: inaction, self-sabotage, relationship sabotage, lying, etc. 

I cannot control their choices nor could I convince them to choose differently, but I can control mine, so I chose to walk away.

It was deeply painful, but you must realize that throwing lifelines to people who do not want to get better will only destroy you. [You are not qualified to save a person drowning like this. Amateur attempts will drown you as well.](https://old.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/mqc2bz/lpt_when_rescuing_someone_who_is_drowning_always/)

# üçÄ Final Words

You *will* get over this. No, you will never be the same, but do you really want to be? Our BPD partners are often unable to grow, but we can. You will grow and come out of this a changed person, a stronger person. You just went through an advanced crash course in severely dysfunctional human psychology.

I recently took the Circle Island Tour with Waimea Waterfall through Go Tours Hawaii, and it exceeded all my expectations. Let me break down why this particular tour stands out from the rest.

First, the efficiency is unmatched. In just 8 hours, you get to see practically everything worth seeing on Oahu. Our guide knew exactly when to hit each spot to avoid the crowds, which made a huge difference in the experience.

The tour starts with convenient pickup from Waikiki hotels around 7 AM. Our first stop was Diamond Head, where we got incredible photos of the coastline. The timing was perfect - early enough to avoid the harsh midday sun and tourist crowds.

What really impressed me was the variety of experiences packed into one day. We went from watching the powerful Halona Blowhole to sampling fresh Kona coffee and macadamia nuts at Tropical Farms. The Nu'uanu Pali Lookout offered breathtaking views that no photo can truly capture.

The highlight for many (myself included) was Waimea Valley. The botanical garden is stunning, but the real treat is the waterfall swim. Tip: Definitely bring your swimsuit - it's an experience you don't want to miss.

The North Shore portion was perfectly timed for lunch. We stopped at the famous shrimp trucks (bring cash!) and had time to explore the legendary Sunset Beach. The guide shared fascinating stories about Hawaiian culture and history throughout the journey.

What sets this tour apart from others I've taken:
- Small group size (max 24 people)
- All entrance fees included
- Knowledgeable local guides
- Perfect balance of activities and driving time
- Strategic timing to avoid crowds
- Comfortable air-conditioned transport

At $154 per person, it's excellent value considering everything that's included. I've paid more for tours that covered less ground and offered fewer experiences.

If you're planning to book (which I highly recommend), I found the best deals through this link: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island

They offer free cancellation up to 24 hours before, and you can reserve now and pay later. Just make sure to book in advance - the best tours fill up quickly, especially during peak season.

One last tip: Bring a light jacket for the morning, cash for lunch and tips, and don't forget your camera - the photo opportunities are endless.

After trying various tour companies on Oahu, this Circle Island Tour consistently delivers the most comprehensive and enjoyable experience of the island. It's perfect for first-time visitors or anyone wanting to maximize their time on Oahu.",1,1753173102.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False
1m68n5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/RentPH/comments/1m68n5e/thoughts_on_electric_bill_sharing/,Thoughts on electric bill sharing?,"Helloo. I just want to ask for insights on how our electric bill is being divided. 

For context, I'm currently bedspacing. 2 rooms, 2 in a room. Each room has a submeter so for the electricity, each room's bill is divided into two then the common area's bill is divided into four. I'm relatively new here so I don't know when this started (the landlord did not make this. Hinahayaan nya lang ang tenants lol) but they have this rule na if someone's out for 5 or more days, di nila babayaran yung days na yun sa electric bill and will be divided by the remaining tenants.

Now, my concern is the two ladies in the other room are in a hybrid setup so sometimes, they go to office but most of the time, they are in the house and they work in the common area. Then uuwi sila sa province nila for 5-10 sometimes 15 days which means di sila babayad ng kuryente for those days. Now one of them pa started using the hot shower which scaaares me coz I know it can be expensive. Meanwhile, my roommate and I rarely go to the province kasi working onsite kami buuut we're usually in our room lang kasi nga may gumagamit ng common areas for wfh. So for the days na wala yung dalawa, sinasalo namin yung electricity sa common area. For reference, ang appliances sa common area ay ref (non inverter i think), microwave, washing machine (manual), electric fan, and electric kettle. I use the kettle once everyday for coffee and of course the ref. Pero other than that, wala na. Microwave, I have only used it twice or thrice in my 2 months here kasi I rarely eat in the house. Literal tulugan at liguan ko lang halos.

I'm not sure if the division is fair. Nalalakihan kasi ako sa bill namin and I know halos kami ng roommate ko ang sasalo kasi umuwi ulit ng province yung dalawang housemates. Should we make adjustments on how the bill is divided? Share your thoughts pls :)

Elara Langton had just finished her global journey and arrived back in Egeorto at 2 AM. Instead of heading to her apartment, she caught a taxi straight to the swankiest hotel in downtown Landblic.

She hadn't slept a wink the night before and was completely drained. When she got to the hotel, exhaustion hit her like a ton of bricks. She swiped her key card and let herself into room 2201 on the top floor.

Too tired to even glance around the suite, she tossed her suitcase into the entryway, unzipped it right there on the floor, and pulled out a black silk nightgown. Then she made a beeline for the bathroom.

The presidential suite had a bathtub right by the window, perfect for soaking while taking in the dazzling night views of Landblic. The one-way glass added a thrilling sense of privacy.

Suddenly, her curiosity was sparked‚Äîthere was a small cabinet next to the tub. Most people wouldn't know what was inside, but Elara knew exactly what to expect‚Äîshe'd seen these setups in plenty of local hotels.

She slipped out of her white dress, opened the cabinet with a flick of her fingers, and her eyes narrowed as she picked out something tempting, tore open the packaging, and stepped into the tub.

\*\*\*\*\*

Three in the morning, and Adrian was deep in sleep‚Äîuntil something tugged him back to the surface. It was a woman's voice, soft and low, like a whisper in the dark. At first, it was just a gentle hum, barely there, but with an undeniable pull.

He was half-asleep, but the sound wrapped around him, dragging him in. He let himself drift, caught in a hazy half-dream, until the hum grew more insistent and urgent...

His heart started racing, and he jolted awake, every nerve on edge. The moment he opened his eyes, the sound hit a high note and then vanished into silence.

Adrian blinked, trying to focus. The hotel room was dark, the only light coming from the dim yellow glow of the bathroom. Everything looked the same as when he'd drifted off. He started to doubt it was just a dream.

He shook his head, feeling a strange mix of confusion and frustration. He'd always been the type to keep a tight rein on his desires. This kind of dream was new territory.

It had to be the stress, the nonstop work for the past month, his mind and body stretched to the breaking point.

He decided a cold shower might help clear his head. Throwing off the covers, he got out of bed, naked.

The bathroom door was wide open. He stepped inside, his long legs carrying him forward. A white dress on the floor caught his eye, and he frowned, puzzled. He moved closer, and then his gaze landed on the bathtub.

There, a naked woman was lounging inside, her eyes half-closed, her face flushed, and her lips parted as she breathed softly. She looked like a dream, but in the most intoxicating way.

Adrian's face remained impassive, but his heart skipped a beat. He stood there for a moment, making sure this wasn't just another strange dream. Then he spoke, his voice calm but firm, ""Who are you?""

Elara was still in a daze, her mind foggy from the afterglow of her little escape. She was halfway to sleep when Adrian's voice startled her. She jerked upright, her eyes wide with surprise as she saw him standing there, his expression unreadable.

He was naked, having just come from bed, and this sent a jolt through Elara. She instinctively covered herself, turning away. She shouted, her voice soft but tinged with panic, ""Hey! You creep! Get out.""

Her voice was just the same as the one in his ""dream""‚ÄîAdrian's eyes narrowed slightly. ""You saw me first,"" he said, his voice low and gravelly. ""And now you're telling me to leave? This is my room.""

Elara rolled her eyes, her voice dripping with sarcasm. ""How shameless!""

""Me, shameless?"" Adrian raised an eyebrow. ""Who's the one in the bathtub, acting all self-righteous while doing something so indecent?""

# Chapter 2 Sexual Harassment

Elara huddled in the tub, feeling like she was about to burst. She was just doing what any woman would do, so she was furious that Adrian was making a fuss over it. She snapped, her voice trembling with anger, ""Get out!""

But Adrian didn't budge. He stood there, unimpressed. ""This is my place. Why should I leave?""

Naked and exposed, Elara felt her anger bubble over. The humiliation of being caught, the frustration of being overruled, and the fact that he was still there‚Äîher chest tightened. She took a deep breath, trying to keep her cool.

After what felt like forever, he still hadn't moved. Elara closed her eyes, took a steadying breath, and softened her tone. ""Sir, have you seen enough? Could you please step out so I can get dressed? And maybe put some clothes on yourself?""

Adrian snapped out of a daze and didn't want any argument with her now. He turned and walked out of the bathroom without another word.

As soon as she heard the door click shut, Elara leaped out of the tub. She grabbed the black silk nightgown, pulled it on, and then tiptoed out.

Right then, Adrian was now sitting on the couch, wrapped in a hotel robe, a cigarette between his fingers.

Before they could even think about another showdown, the doorbell rang.

Adrian stood up, his tall frame looming over her. As he walked past, she felt a strange sense of intimidation wash over her.

Elara crossed her arms, her eyes still flashing with anger. ""Pervert! Where are you going?"" she snapped.

Without turning around, Adrian replied coldly, ""Who's the pervert here is still up for debate. Since we can't seem to sort this out, let the hotel handle it.""

He opened the door to reveal a woman in a grey pantsuit, her makeup flawless and her smile professional. She was the hotel's VIP manager. ""Mr. Hartley, you mentioned someone broke into your room?"" she asked.

Adrian's expression was grim as he stepped aside to let her in. He pointed to Elara, who was standing by the couch. ""That's her. She broke into my room at night and sexually harassed me.""

Elara froze. 'What? Broke into his room? Sexually harassed him? Me?'

Already seething, she exploded. ""Do you have some narcissistic problem? Think you're Brad Pitt or something? Why would I even want to harass you?""

""Isn't it obvious?"" Adrian retorted. ""Who was naked in my bathtub, enjoying‚Äî""

Elara cut him off sharply, her voice rising in panic. ""Shut up!""

Adrian didn't continue, but he didn't want to let her go. He said, his tone biting, ""So this isn't harassment?""

Elara knew she was no match for this silver-tongued man. Her face burning with frustration, she marched to the entryway, grabbed her key card and ID from her suitcase, and thrust them at the manager.

She said, ""Here's my key card and ID. I used it to get in here, just like anyone else.""

Her face was now flushed with anger, her delicate features twisted into a scowl that somehow made her look more exasperated than intimidating.

She pointed a slender finger at Adrian and snapped, ""The real creep here is him! He sneaked into my room in the middle of the night to spy on me while I was bathing. I'm calling the police.""

The manager glanced at the right key card and frowned. Hearing Elara's threat to call the police, she started to panic. That was the last thing the hotel needed.

""Ms. Langton,"" she said quickly, ""there must be some misunderstanding. Maybe the hotel system glitched and gave you the wrong room, or the front desk handed you the wrong key card.

""It's late now. Let me arrange a new room for you. I'll give you a full explanation in the morning, okay?""

Elara was exhausted, but Adrian's harsh words still rankled her. She retorted, ""Why don't you check him first? Did he check in under his own name? Does he even have a key for this room?""

""Ms. Langton,"" the manager explained, ""Mr. Hartley is a close friend of our boss. This room is reserved for him permanently and isn't available for rent. Technically, he can't be considered an intruder.""

# Chapter 3 Beware

Elara was stunned into silence. It seemed she was really supposed to just take this. She glanced at Adrian, whose lips curled into a self-satisfied smirk, as if he was daring her to come up with a comeback.

But she just couldn't bring herself to back down. ""So you're saying I just have to swallow this and call it a night? Even though I was seen naked for no reason, and now he's accusing me of harassment?""

The manager looked apologetic. ""I'm really sorry. Please stay in another room tonight. We'll sort this out first thing tomorrow morning‚Äî""

Elara didn't want to hear more. She grabbed her phone from her bag and started dialing 911.

The manager's eyes widened in panic, and she glanced nervously at Adrian.

Before Elara could finish, Adrian grabbed her wrist and yanked the phone away. ""Miss, looking at someone naked isn't a crime. Calling the police won't change that. Besides, I was in the room first. If anyone's at fault here, it's you for barging in.""

His expression was cold and menacing, his eyes hard and unyielding. He had that air of someone used to being in control.

He didn't want to cause trouble for his friend's hotel, and as their regular lawyer, he knew a police report would only make things worse for him.

Adrian took another step closer, his cold gaze meeting her frightened one. His words were a clear threat. ""If you call the police, I'll sue you for trespassing and harassment.""

He tightened his grip on Elara's slender wrist, holding her so tightly that her skin turned red.

Elara winced, her eyes filling with tears. ""How dare you‚Äî"" Her voice was barely above a whisper, trembling with rage, and even the manager felt a flicker of sympathy.

Adrian's relentless approach also made the manager start to worry. She quickly stepped in. ""Mr. Hartley, let's calm down. Let me talk to her first and see if we can sort this out.""

Adrian released Elara's wrist, but his stern expression remained unchanged.

Elara frowned, her eyes glistening with tears as she rubbed her reddened wrist. Her usually confident voice wavered. ""Give me my phone back.""

Adrian tensed, thinking she might call the police. His grip on the phone tightened.

Elara lunged for her phone, her face streaked with tears. ""You'll regret this."" She tossed over her shoulder, her voice shaking. She spun around, grabbed a camel coat from her suitcase in the hallway, threw it on, and yanked her high heels back on. Then she stormed out.

Adrian raised an eyebrow. 'She's scared off just like that? I haven't even gotten a chance to question her yet, and she's already acting like the victim?'

\*\*\*\*\*

Elara gritted her teeth, dragging her suitcase out of the hotel. She pulled out her phone and made a call. ""Ruby, what kind of dump did you recommend? This place is trash!""

Her friend Ruby sounded surprised. ""Wait, what? It's the top-rated hotel in town.""

""Is it the kind where you end up getting arrested?""

Ruby, back home and sipping her coffee, frowned in confusion. ""What are you talking about?""

""I'm posting about this on my social media. This hotel is a disaster.""

""Hey, don't! I'm trying to get in good with the owner. Don't mess this up for me.""

""You're so blinded by this guy. You have no idea how much I've been through today.""

Ruby didn't know what happened exactly and sighed, trying to smooth things over, ""Can't you just let it go? You haven't seen how hot this guy is. I finally got him to agree to dinner this weekend by having you promote his hotel.""

""No way. I can't take this. I'm exposing him. And I'm getting my influencer friends to share it.""

Ruby laughed, ""Elara, calm down. Was it bad service? Or was the place dirty? Once I've got this guy wrapped around my finger, I'll get back at him for you.

""Oh, and he's got this super-hot friend. I'll introduce you. This top lawyer guy‚Äîwell, if I weren't into Victor, I'd never let him go.""

""Thanks, but I'll pass. You can keep those two for yourself.""

""Elara, seriously, are you just going to stick with Alex forever?""

""Hey, you're right. Alex is the hottest guy ever.""

After hanging up, Elara quickly drafted a tweet, then set up her phone tripod at the hotel entrance and started filming a video. Her fingers tapped away on the screen and soon, the tweet was posted.

\[Beware! Dolphin Bay Hotel owned by Montgomery Group ($3,000/night) is a scam. A creep broke in, and the manager silenced me, no cops allowed. The creep, a lawyer, blamed me for trespassing‚Äîall threats, no solutions! Avoid it, girls. It's pricey and ruins trips.\]

# Chapter 4 Is It A Big Deal?

In Room 2201 of Dolphin Bay Hotel, Adrian sat on the couch, still wearing his hotel robe and smoking a cigarette.

He had just wrapped up a major case here. Last night, he'd hung out with some friends, drank until he was tipsy, and stumbled back to the hotel around midnight. Too tired to do anything else, he'd taken a quick shower and crashed into bed.

At 4 a.m., his grogginess vanished after the incident. He grabbed his phone from the bedside table, padded back to the couch, and poured himself a drink. His phone had died somehow, and he turned it on and started scrolling through his unread messages.

Victor: \[Crash in my room tonight. 2209, y' know. I got to hook up with this top influencer for a hotel staycation promo. She's a big deal‚Äîhard to get. Last-minute arrangement, no spare rooms, and my place is cluttered‚Äîso she's staying in yours.\]

After reading the message, Adrian frowned and quickly typed back: \[I pissed her off. Is it a big deal?\]

Victor was back home, playing golf with friends. When he saw the text, he was stunned. \[Huh?\]

Adrian: \[Saw your text too late. She was in the tub‚ÄîI walked in.\]

Victor: \[What? You!\]

Adrian: \[Troublesome for you?\]

Victor: \[Yeah... So? Did you apologize? What did she say?\]

Adrian: \[I didn't apologize.\]

Victor: \[What? Man!\]

Adrian tossed his phone aside and didn't reply. Not only did he not apologize, but he even said something threatening.

\*\*\*\*\*

Elara took a cab back to her place and fell asleep almost immediately. She woke up naturally at 1 p.m. the next noon. She glanced out the window at the warm sunshine. It was her last time in this apartment, and she felt a pang of sadness.

Recently I got the idea to share a simple passion of mine and make it sort of a community.

Once a week I try to go for a walk with my trash picker and a garbage bag to pick up trash around my house area.

I believe we are all responsible for cleaning our own livings spaces, even if it is cleaning someone else's trash.

my IDEA is however to grow this into more of a community event style where on a week evening or weekend day we go for a group cleanup of an area in or around eindhoven, afterwards it can be enjoyed by some coffee I will make.

I want to inspire others this way to take accountability for cleaning their streets, and hopefully make a cleaner nature around and in Eindhoven.

How would people here react to this, would you be open to join this once in a while? If it takes just 60-90 minutes of your day?

This made me realise how real this is, and I think about this once in a while to encourage myself. 
So, a few months, maybe close to a year back, I learned about manifestation.
Back in the day they told me to try and manifest something small, something I have no resistance towards, to make my believe around it grow. A lot of people recommended manifesting a free coffee. To me this wouldn't work because I have a client who gives me free coffee a few times a week. So I needed to do something different. But I also wanted it to be very specific, so I couldn't tell myself it was a coincidence. 
So that's when I told myself I would manifest a purple football. Specifically purple, because I never saw one. Nor do you ever see it anywhere.
The only thing I did was envision it a few times, whenever I thought about it, and believe I would find/see it somewhere.
I take my dog out twice a day, we go for a walk in the forrest behind my house. 
Not a lot of people go there, it's mostly known by the locals. So I barely ever see anyone there...
Let's say about a week later, I go for a walk, like I usually do. My dog is well trained and is mostly off leash... 
Suddenly she goes right into the forrest, between some bushes and trees... I followed her, and there it was, a purple blown-up BALLOON! (Nope not a football tho)
Mind you, no one was around, there was no sign of life... 
Can you imagine this? In the middle of the forrest, no one around, one single purple balloon, and my dog found it. I wouldn't even have seen it, if she wasn't off leash!
That's when I realised this is all real, tears started flowing, because this was the sign I needed...
You could say that this isn't specific enough, since I wanted a football. But maybe this is how it works sometimes. You ask for something, you get it, it might not always go or be the way you imagined it completely, but you still get it.
I was certain this was it. This was my turning point... I took the balloon home, and kept it as a reminder.
I hope I inspired some of you, who have doubts about this to try this out for yourself. Be specific, but it must be something, you don't actually care about. Something you would be fine with, if you didn't find it. But be certain you will. I guess this is exactly how bigger manifestations come true. Trust you will find it, but don't have a need for it. 
This is one of the many small things I manifested, but this one was the one that made my belief rock solid. Find something like that for yourself, it will give you so much encouragement!

I take my dog out twice a day, we go for a walk in the forrest behind my house. 
Not a lot of people go there, it's mostly known by the locals. So I barely ever see anyone there...
Let's say about a week later, I go for a walk, like I usually do. My dog is well trained and is mostly off leash... 
Suddenly she goes right into the forrest, between some bushes and trees... I followed her, and there it was, a purple blown-up BALLOON! (Nope not a football tho)
Mind you, no one was around, there was no sign of life...

1m68gbl,https://i.redd.it/zp4otxnaxdef1.png,PC black screening post BIOS update,"Hey everyone,

  
I flashed my BIOS yesterday to version 7B98v1F for the Z390-A PRO motherboard. Since then, I've had a few instances upon booting up games that my computer will black screen and I have to initiate a hard re-boot.

  
I updated my graphics drivers in line with the BIOS update, but it just seemed to happen to me just now upon booting Resident Evil 4 remake, but before that I was playing Session Skate Sim with no issues for about an hour, so I can't seem to pinpoint what the issue could be.

  
Any ideas or help would be greatly appreciated, specs attached are my own, if that helps?

  
Thank you!",1,1753172302.0,pchelp,1,1.0,False

1m68f6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1m68f6b/zp6_users_in_the_uk_bean_recommendations/,ZP6 users in the UK: bean recommendations,"Morning all,

As title says I need some recommendations for beans that you have tried and work really with the ZP6. 

I bought the ZP6 a month ago and had really good results with the leftover naturals I had from Skylark coffee. 

I then ordered two washed process bags from Scenery coffee and have spent nearly the whole two bags trying to dial in. I had a chest infection and realised a couple of days ago my zero point drifted to 1! So all my dialling in notes I made were futile üò≠ I‚Äôll include the specific bags I got below in case someone has got specific tips for the few cups I have left. The cups I have had were flat and muted. But I was probably grinding way too coarse. 

When I was going mad thinking what is wrong it occurred to me that my beans may have defects hence this post. 

I‚Äôm looking predominantly for washed coffees as this is what I have read work really well with the ZP6. Any general tips etc are more than welcome üôÇ

Edit: forgot to mention that I have now calibrated the zero point (burr lock) correctly and ground 250grams of beans I managed to get from a coffee shop and can see the zero point has remained in place. ",1,1753172179.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
