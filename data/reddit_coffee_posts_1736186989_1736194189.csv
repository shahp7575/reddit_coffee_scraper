1hv8d4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1hv8d4i/home_decor_ocd/,Home decor OCD,"Wondering if any of you can relate to this. I'm obsessed with my apartment. I fuss over every little detail, everything has to be in its perfect place at all times, everything is placed at a certain angle and position, messes (even a hair tie on my coffee table for example) is unacceptable, everything needs to match and coordinate just so. I have spent savings and racked up credit card debt when I decide that my apartment's design no longer suits me, and I WILL NOT rest or stop spending until every little itch is satisfied. My therapist thinks I have OCD because I'm ""obsessing"" over my apartment, creating in my mind all of these little problems (ie - this candle should be over there actually, or I need a different area rug) and ""compulsing"" by rearranging constantly and shopping until I find the ""perfect piece"". In my mind it feels like I'm putting together a jigsaw puzzle, and it always feels like I'm just one or two pieces away from being complete. But the completeness feeling doesn't last for very long until I start generating new ""problems"" to ""solve"".  


I have always had some symptoms that I guess would be considered classic OCD, like I have always liked things neat and tidy even when I was a kid, my room was spotless and my stuffed animals were aligned from shortest to tallest. I tap and rub my fingers together pretty much constantly. I get very uncomfortable in messy, and especially dirty environments.",1,1736193964.0,OCD,0,1.0,False

However, I disagree and reflected on my own experiences and others. Asking for a date leads to failure more likely than asking to meet-up or have dinner. Asking for a date directly implies romantic intention from the beginning and if you don't meet the checkboxes for having a spark, being super attractive, building rapport, you won't get a date. Asking to grab dinner together or meeting up opens the opportunity to build any natural connection and allows other dynamics to develop, such as a friendship, fwb, relationship, network. I've had dating experiences only from asking out girls to grab food together or coffee and I'm thinking of going back to that. I've had zero success from directly asking for a date because I'm not 'perfect' or attractive enough to develop a spark that leads to romance, but have alot more ""inside my book"" versus the cover upfront that allows me to have an opportunity.",1,1736193706.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**

I have to say, watching the Spurs go toe-to-toe with the Denver Nuggets was impressive. Victor Wembanyama has been on fire lately ‚Äì but Chicago has won 3 of their last 4 outings, including the 2 home games against the NY Knicks and the MIL Bucks in that stretch. I think it‚Äôs very likely that the Bulls pull off the upset here, but I have no doubt that even if they take a loss, they‚Äôll keep the game close and at the very least cover the spread. I‚Äôm on Chicago to keep it within 3.¬†

1hv85jc,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1hv85jc/am_i_being_played/,Am I being played?,"Almost two years ago I (25 M) met this guy (35 M) at my gym. We started off as friends, but slowly developed feelings for each other. What used to be occasional text messages and coffee dates eventually became daily messages (e.g., wishing each other good morning and good night; talking frequently throughout the day) and frequent coffee dates, lunches, and dinner. I've come to realize that I really like this guy-- he's smart, attractive, and so kind. I have never felt this way about a person before. I could also tell that he felt the same way about me.

Now, two months ago, we finally confessed feelings for each other. He said that he was extremely attracted to me (both physically and emotionally) and could not stop thinking about me. However, there was (and still is) a problem: he has a husband that he's been with for 10+ years. During this conversation, he said that he and his husband have been having **major issues** for years. He's been unhappy, and unfulfilled with his current marriage, but still loves his husband and cares for him. He wanted to make it work with his husband even though he felt like he couldn't.

We decided to take a one week break from talking to each other. However, this did not work. We are so obsessed with each other. We still ended up talking daily, and still went on coffee dates. His husband realized that I was in the picture now, and ultimately this situation resulted in a choice for him (the 30 M): choosing to leave for me or choosing to stay with his husband.

He decided to spend time apart from his husband and spent more time with me. We went on dates, work out classes together... it was great. We even started talking more intimately. Several times he's made comments such as ""I've made my decision"" or ""I need to tell my husband that I've made a choice"". However, he is finding many reasons to postpone making this decision. This is also partially due to his husband (who now hates me) saying that he has not given them a fair change to fix things. He and his husband spent Christmas and NYE together.

A month ago he told me he needed one week to be sure about his decision. Now, today, he is still taking time to decide. He decided to spend time alone this week to reflect on everything. I've always wanted him to take time, but it seems like he is finding reasons not to make this decision. The wait is painful.

What hurts the most is knowing that if he chooses to stay with his husband, his husband will make him cast me aside and remove me from his life. It's unfortunate, because I would not do the same-- I would still let him support his husband if we ended up together. 

Ultimately, I wonder if I am being played. Am I just this side piece who is just here as an option while he tries to make things work with his husband? Or am I being unreasonable? ",1,1736193480.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False

Choo Choo

When I ask him why I am deeply saddened by his absence he says ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in love‚Äù ‚ÄúI love you, baby. Just like that, too.‚Äù

And his voice sounds like the resonance of a church choir finishing a hymn about life and death. About the prosperous and the unfortunate. I kneel to pray, but at his feet. I am ravenous and a slave to his scent. I am intertwined in the way his back feels against my breasts when I hold him at night. I have never been brought to tears by the thought of a man, but they fall from my eyes like rain. He says my name and it pours out in buttery soft sounds as if he knows that he can make love with his voice; a spell that has wrapped me so tightly I can‚Äôt surrender to thoughtful action.

I lift my shirt to reveal my breasts to him. Most times he lifts his shirt to touch his chest to mine. He has the most incredible hair on his chest; I adore my face pressed into him. I fear that my intensity of love for him is due to my feeling of him leaving me, for another. I am going to be 37 soon, he is 51. I know that the age gap might seem great, but I am blind to it now. When I first met him in person it was obvious, but now, I feel ancient with him. We‚Äôve known each other before in another life.

This is what I tell myself, this is the blanket my heart weaves that keeps me warm at night when I‚Äôm not with him.

I‚Äôd tell you here and now that I know a lot about obsession and a hearts deep yearning. I‚Äôve been to this familiar ground many times before... and I‚Äôll likely be here again until some underpaid asshole shovels dirt on my expensive box.

You must think ‚ÄúHow do you know that you love him?‚Äù All I know about this love is the tie that happened during intimacy. May as well have strapped a concrete block to my feet and pushed me into the Chicago River. Make it green like St. Patty‚Äôs Day. Green like envy. Green like yeast infections and money. For some time, I held interest in tarot and the metaphysical. I threw all my decks out and cursed the day I‚Äôd ever get my hands on one again. I had fallen into a spell of bad luck. No pun intended. But I watch it on YouTube, because I‚Äôm a hypocrite.

Hours upon hours upon hours of zodiac sign monthly pulls.

‚ÄúWow! You won‚Äôt believe this Aquarius!‚Äù January 2025 Tarot - and the bitch of it is that there are people, me included, who believed and still do believe that it‚Äôs true. I watch them and wait for confirmation of what I want to hear. You guessed it, love. I want to hear about love. If I don‚Äôt resonate at all ‚Äì well ‚Äì I click off until I find something that speaks to what I want.

If they even so much as mutter the sign of the man that I‚Äôm pining over ‚Äì I watch diligently until my eyes burn from the screen. Countless thieves roam the internet waiting for pathetic people like me to fall for their droll and sweep themselves away into paying for a personal reading. They collect on the pain sad people feel.

News flash. We are all sad.

When I was a young girl, my father always told me to ‚Äúshut the fuck up and stop whining‚Äù; it didn‚Äôt do anything for me other than make me sorry. To everyone and everything. Sorry for reacting appropriately, sorry when I don‚Äôt. Sorry when it has nothing to do with me at all. Sorry for sharing the same air in the same room on the same planet. Well, I‚Äôm an adult now and so much of that life is gone. I cut ties with the only relatives I have left recently, and I feel no sorrow. Nothing. Not a shrivel of a tear. I‚Äôve cried them all. Sadness has become me and is no longer a feeling that could touch me like kissing cousins on a prepubescent hunt.

I was married for 13 years before I announced I to the father of my children that divorce was imminent, and I didn‚Äôt feel a single thing other than relief; call me cold-hearted. I was tired of living a lie. I had been lying to myself mostly.

The challenge for me now is that I am bombarded with debt. Financial, emotional, physical debt. I owe everyone something and I can‚Äôt get my bearings on any of it. From Lawyers to work to my apartment and my kids ‚Äì I‚Äôm a damn mess. I spoke with my therapist about ditching my parents and the guilt I feel with it; she says they are toxic people.

They are without a doubt toxic people.

My Fathers birthday just passed like a freighter‚Äì and I looked back for a moment in recollection of the fear I had harnessed as a little girl not knowing if her mother was coming back. I was dropped off and told by my mother:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just for a couple of weeks Mandy. I‚Äôll be back before you know it.‚Äù

Choo ‚Äì Choo. She sang ‚ÄúMama comes back, she always comes back‚Äù in her sing song voice with her wretched stink breath and I knew then that I‚Äôd likely not see her for a long time.

Choo ‚Äì Choo.

She lost custody of my sister and I after her then boyfriend ‚Äì turned husband several years later ‚Äì beat the shit out of me for slamming the front door of the house as we ran in and out over and over and over

Choo ‚Äì Choo. Playing outside with our friends. I was in first grade. I remember the sting of the slotted spoon and the sound of the scream from out of my mouth like I had been struck by a million buzzing bees. He wet the spoon before he beat me black and blue to make sure he flew the point straight home.

Funny, only his anger landed. Funny, only realizing later in life that I am the train.

I had to attend school the following morning, I showed the girl that lived next door to me what happened. Barbara was her name. My mother entrusted her to walk me sometimes in the morning.

Unbuttoning my pants and pulling them down to reveal my black and purple legs she took me to high school instead. I was interviewed by the nurse and taken from my mother and placed under my father‚Äôs care. He was a better option by far, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I am grateful that he did, but I didn‚Äôt like him. He was mean and didn‚Äôt carry an ounce of warmth in him that my little breaking heart needed. He wasn‚Äôt kind or compassionate to me - even then as a small broken girl.

My aunt told me when I was a bit older that I used to call him ‚ÄúIcky Black Face‚Äù because he worked on a dock and was dirty all of the time. As I type this, I feel the guilt for my words ‚Äì but I‚Äôm cloaked in outrage for a life that wasn‚Äôt for me. I couldn‚Äôt have what other people had.

The welcome I got to his house when he took custody was a shitty handmade mobile hanging off the ceiling fan. He got his just desserts when I pissed the bed nearly every night out of fear. I was reeling still from the pain of my mother leaving and the physical/sexual abuse I had endured while under her care. The same man who beat me to a bloody pulp also touched my little body as much as he wanted ‚Äì my own mother bearing witness.

My father would wrap me in my blanket in the middle of the night so I wasn‚Äôt cold and wouldn‚Äôt feel the urine seeping through the sheets I just soiled. Night after night like clockwork I‚Äôd wake up to the damp cold until the damp cold became me.

You know, through the years I have heard in order to be a writer you need to read. I don‚Äôt read, though I try. Day to day I have many things going on ‚Äì so many that if I sat down to read, I‚Äôd have time for nothing else. I live in the Midwest and it is winter. I should be hunkered down and cozy in this beautiful couch that my boyfriend got me snuggled up with a book; or should I really? I‚Äôd rather fight the middle-aged woman norms and instead pace around the floor staring at everything I need to do

Laundry? ‚ÄúFuck you‚Äù I say to the pile staring at me in the corner.

Scrub the bathroom? ‚ÄúSoap scum thicker than the walls of my pussy‚Äù I say staring into my face in the mirror, shocked at my own audacity.

Breakthroughs ‚Äì not breakdowns! Progress doesn‚Äôt equal perfection. Fuck the police coming straight from the underground. And on and on are the nonsense thoughts swirling around a manic brain full of bloody kneed heartache.

I do all the cleaning simultaneously so that none of it actually gets completed to its potential. I have been counting the days until the warmth and the sun graces my back again, but it‚Äôs pained from being railed by the man who will be the death of me. He will be the death of me.

It‚Äôs hard to believe that I have been in this new apartment for almost a month. It‚Äôs nothing to gaff at really, it‚Äôs tiny. It‚Äôs location leaves little to be desired but it‚Äôs not quite the worst parts of the city. I am dreaming of a Lake Michigan home somewhere near the Upper Peninsula in Michigan and wishing on every star that one day my dream will turn into a reality. I want to wake up to the sound of the wind sending waves crashing to the shore. I want to have my coffee on a humid morning staring out into the expanse of blue green heaven. I want to smell the fishy air and stick my tongue out as far as it can go so the falling rain drops aren‚Äôt jealous of my own squinty eyed anticipation. I close them and wait for the burst to come, and when it does I have to stop myself from gagging.

I can‚Äôt figure out sometimes if he‚Äôs coming or going.

In reality, I want to build a web and stay in it. I want to spin and spin and spin until I can catch anything I want. I want to continue to lie to myself and say that I‚Äôll write the book someday and maybe someone who is anyone will read it and think I‚Äôm not a wasted humanoid taking up space.

I am only a moment away from spontaneous combustion. Not until he is finished, first.

1hv820s,https://www.reddit.com/r/timbers/comments/1hv820s/axe_photos_an_experiential_review/,Axe Photos: An experiential review ,"Stats: Reservation window (3-4:30).  Time entered line: 3:15pm.  Out of the Stadium: 6:15pm.  Parking: $4.25 on a Sunday.  Consumption: One coffee, Two hot chocolates, 4 colored pictures, 5 restroom breaks (I gots 2 kids).  Results: 36 pictures with definitely some keepers. 

So, this is the third time I‚Äôve done Axe pictures, 2011, 2015, (skipped 2021, sorry-not-sorry had an 18-month-old right then), and now 2025.  Man has it grown.  I remember a lot of old heads in 2011 commenting: ‚ÄúCome by my garage, I‚Äôll take some pics infront of a white sheet and call it a day.‚Äù  But by head count, it is absolutely a staple of this little football community.  Kinda crazy to think it was just a photog and assistant in a downtown store front prior to the MLS jump, and now its 4 studio stalls in Tanner Ridge.  But hey, Portland has changed in that time as well.

A little encouraged by the reports of fast-wait times and the addition of reservation slots (for STH), we thought we‚Äôd give it a chance.  Here are some particulars:

Set-up (4/5): Can‚Äôt think of much to improve here.  Enter in Gate D, wind around on the first floor for 25 minutes before getting in the escalator up to Tanner Ridge.  Shop open and one food stand that did not seem highly patronized. 

Amenities (4/5): Again, can‚Äôt complain.  Had what they needed and the newer side of the stadium definitely has nicer restrooms than the OG side.  Some of the FO merch actually looks pretty cool.  But I‚Äôm not of the sort to pay $135 for a white (!) bowling shirt, as cool as it is.  Hey, they got to capitalize on the fanbase some how, but the amount of swag the team cranks out ‚Ä¶ surprising.  Nice that a food stand was open.  Once upstairs, coffee! Some Swag!  Coloring tables for the kids!  NICE!  I guess I coulda gotten a beer downstairs (I think?) but I‚Äôm on a dry January, so didn‚Äôt investigate further.  Swag was unexpected, some enamel pins, newly designed RCTID stickers, and Chara ticket stubs (Ironic, as there are not actual game stubs for 10+ years) but didn‚Äôt expect any of that, so it was nice to see.  (Oh!  And I see on that side they added a lactation station.  That is something I‚Äôve kinda bitched about 5 years ago when we were going through it.  At the time, options were the EMT space or at guest services, which is weird!  I know its something that immediately effects only 1% of the population at a given time, but nice to see.  Thank you.)

Wait Times (0/5):  Dammit.  I feel fooled again.  3 frikken hours with my little kids, whom I love, but damn if waiting in line just sucks.  Via the Social Meds, I see folks reporting 45-minute wait times on day 1, so I was optimistic.  Fool me.  Lesson learned: earliest in the day as possible.  I guess its like airport timing: later in the day everything is going to push back.  I‚Äôd guess the last group in would have been about 7:30 on Sunday night.  But that was mitigated the best as possible by:

Staff (5/5):  Awesome, awesome job guys.  THANK YOU for being so cool, engaging with fans in line.  HAVING A COLORING STATION TO DISTRACT KIDS.  Coffee (and leastways decent stuff).  Hot chocolate.  Everyone we interacted with was top notch.  A+.  Quick note: this event in its 4th regular cadence, is produced by the Front Office.  Top notch photographers aren‚Äôt free.  Set ups, equipment, space (well, maybe the space is free, or at least paid for), personnel all paid for.  This was done for the fans to be part of the community.  Yes, there are problems with the FO.  I won‚Äôt list them here, check all the other threads.  But for producing this event that connects team with community ‚Äì Thanks.  That‚Äôs it.

Photographer (8/5):  So, in 2015, we had the original photographer from 2011 who remembered me at first glance.  I *think* there were two stations if I remember right.  We waited for our slot, got posed a bit, took our picture, and we were outta there in 3 minutes.  THIS time ‚Äì damn.  36 shots, about 20 that are definitely worthy and it honestly felt like a professional photo shoot.  Great work posing the family, having patience with my kids, getting us all in sync (smile or game face).  Took a bit of suggestions as to what would work for us.  Even matched us pose-for-pose with our 2015 picture.  Nicely done.  Just cannot say enough. 

Outcome (infinity/5):  Awesome artwork that is reflective of the time we all put into this team.  As weird as it is to say, the Timbers take up too much of my mindshare, and having a photoshoot on that theme is kind of a physical representation of that.  I appreciate it.  I honestly can‚Äôt stop reviewing them the day after.  Great artifact.  Which brings me to:

Digital Interface (0/5):  Frustrating waiting for all our dang pictures to load!  =).  I know 100% of folks were hitting the website last night, but that took f-o-r-e-v-e-r.  Fortunately something clicked at about 10:30 pm and pages were loading faster then.  Pro-tip: as soon as you can, find your pictures and favorite them for quick recall.

i feel like i‚Äôm in such a mess i can‚Äôt get out of it - but im also extremely empathetic and hate to see people down and hurting so im hopeful here i can receive some clear level minded un-involved advice or encouragement. 

i met my partner just over 2 years ago on bumble (i know, sigh). coming off the pandemic was hard for me, week before the world shut down i‚Äôd ended a four year relationship with the person i thought id spend my life with. it had become dull, stagnant and more of a friendship. no hard feelings to him still cheering him on from afar 5 years later. 

i pretty much avoided men and dating for 3 years after that. i started to casually see someone in mid 2023, and i really had a thing for him. but sadly he was not looking for anything super serious and our long term goals did not align so when i met my current partner i broke things off with him because this guy seemed more in alignment with me and my long term goals. 

things were realllllly good reallllly fast. i see now i was definitely ‚Äúlove bombed‚Äù. i don‚Äôt think that‚Äôd always a bad thing but that‚Äôs what happened. 

he had shared with me that he had been in a 5 year relationship until march of 2022 and that the girl he was with cheated on him and then just left without saying anything. my heart hurt so bad for him. he seemed so great and i couldn‚Äôt hardly believe someone could do that to him. 

well. lolll. it‚Äôs now early february. one day he told me i could jsut head to his house and hangout and he‚Äôd meet me there once he was off since he worked about an hour later than me and we lived about an hour and a half apart. i get there and there‚Äôs a package on his porch, so i pick it up because that seems like a normal thing to do. well. the package is addressed to his ex ü§° i don‚Äôt say anything until he gets there and he seems shocked and thrown off as well. says he will take it to his moms where she can pick it up there. he assures me he is only talking to me and i‚Äôm the only person he‚Äôs interested in. i brush it off. 

about a week later. one of my closest friends mom (who i counted as a second mom of my own) passed away tragically and very h expectedly. the funeral was quite a ways away so i stayed with my mom the night before who was also going to attend so we could travel together. that night he was so strange. barely texted me. said goodnight at like 8pm. very unlike him. 

a few days later we hangout. he goes to do something outside and it‚Äôs jsut felt so off and weird and even his space feels like different as in a bad energy is existing there. he left his phone on the coffee table where i was sitting and i see he receives a text from his ex. i am so ashamed but yes i picked up his phone and i looked. and i see they‚Äôve been texting the entire time we‚Äôve known eachother. he was begging her to come over the night i spent with my mom before the funeral. i get up and i leave. i do not say a single word. i leave. 

he finally realizes this and begins to call me non stop. i answer and he‚Äôs like hey what‚Äôs going on? and i say i saw you‚Äôve been texting her xyz. he swears repeatedly he has not been. INSANE. i said i saw it so can you please stop lying. silence. he convinces me he‚Äôs trying to be nice to her so she will come get the rest of her stuff in his garage. i‚Äôm so stupid i believe it and go back. ugh. 

for about a month things are good again. just going through the motion. then again i have to leave town to attend a concert with my friends and he goes fucking weirdo again. he is into biking so i downloaded an app called strava that‚Äôs used to track rides. and i see they‚Äôve been riding bikes together while i am away. i also see that they did not stop dating in march instead it was late october, a month and a half before we met. i would have never entertained it if id known it was such a fresh break up. i say enough is enough. i‚Äôm done. we go our separate ways. 

a month later he reaches out to me. full of apologies. saying he never got closure from her bc she just left without saying anything and that was hard for him (i have confirmed this to be true. this is indeed how she left and she did cheat on him). i am strong for maybe a week and then i give in. we hangout. things are going so well again. my lease ends in another month or so and we move in together. u. g. h. 

so we move in and it‚Äôs fine. we stayed in his area because he refused to go elsewhere. i‚Äôm now driving over an hour to and from work a day when my commute was ten minutes. 

i‚Äôm happy. i think? this is great, right? 

no. things never get better. this girl refuses to leave us alone and he won‚Äôt make her. she has continued to randomly text him throughout the entirety of our relationship.

one example being we went on a bike trip to snowshoe wv, and were having dinner after a wonderful day. he‚Äôs showing me pictures from the day. i say hey can i send that to me. he said yes. i hit the message button to send it to me and why is she the most recent contact listed. i say go to your messages. he does. sure enough there‚Äôs a text from her there. at this point i‚Äôm losing my mind in public. the text is phrased as a reply saying miss you too wish i was there with you blah blah. 

he said he didn‚Äôt text her so i keep asking how she knows where we are at and why she would phrase it like that and he can‚Äôt answer me. i start to call her from my phone bc at this point girl what are you even doin we both look dumb. she won‚Äôt answer. she instead has her mom send me a threat on fb messenger. 

i am states away with nowhere to go. this isn‚Äôt an isolated incident. she has ruined every trip we‚Äôve gone on. he also tells me she has texted him recently asking him to buy her a phone and a new bike. 

i was going to leave but he promised things would get better. he finally texted her and her mom and told them to fuck off and i saw the messages. but i feel like it‚Äôs just too far gone. this happened may of 24 and it‚Äôs now january of 25 and i think about all of this everyday. 

i do have love for this person but im not sure im in love anymore. i‚Äôm also not someone who can continue to forgive and forgive because i don‚Äôt forget and it‚Äôs drastically hurting my quality of life. 

i‚Äôve tried to leave many times and he just breaks down so hard it‚Äôs so hard to watch. i honestly know why she left th way she did because it‚Äôs so hard to have a conversation to end it where i don‚Äôt end up feeling guilty or pressured to stay in fear he may hurt himself or something. he hasn‚Äôt said that explicitly but the way he acts it is scary. 

the last time i was about to leave and was convinced to stay he went and adopted two puppies a few days later. i hate him for this. i am so attached to these dogs but i cannot afford anywhere alone where they can be and he knows that. i feel like he did it to trap me. 

he has hit me about three times and said some really awful things to me. i also replay these instances in my mind almost daily. 

i‚Äôm in a lot of pain but the biggest pain i feel is thinking about causing him pain. 

what‚Äôs wrong with me. please don‚Äôt be unkind i know i probably sound incredibly stupid and naive and maybe i am but cruelty won‚Äôt help me. i need encouragement that i deserve to live a happy life and sadly that‚Äôs not happening right now. i feel so insane for doing this to myself. i honestly think im happiest alone. the amount of gaslighting, manipulation and emotional abuse ive endured over the last two years are incredibly damaging to my self psyche and wellbeing. i don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs real or fake anymore.

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm a 26M who moved to Victoria 4-5 months ago from the US. Canadian American dualie.

I used to attend NA meetings and really liked the ability to just share whatever was on my mind, whatever was troubling me to a group. However, the crowd was generally a bit older and there was a general bleakness in the atmosphere just due to the nature of the meetings. There‚Äôs also a strict template to the program and a high degree of religiosity that can drive people away who have a different take on spirituality.

Being on Reddit, I see how bleak the current state of the world seems to most people within 10 years of my age. I am a highly social person and know that the drastic decrease in socialization in my life since COVID began has been a huge net negative. Everyone is consumed by our social media doom spiraling now, gender wars and culture wars, tensions due to immigration and identity politics. There‚Äôs a myriad of issues we‚Äôre facing right now and it seems worse than ever before.

But it‚Äôs likely the same as ever before. Problem I see now is we don‚Äôt get together to talk about these issues in person. Or talk about anything in person! We nowadays often tend to exist within these online platforms that quickly become pessimistic echo chambers, and online people do not pull their punches. In real life, you don‚Äôt act cruel to someone‚Äôs face. We are social creatures and we‚Äôve forgotten how we are supposed to treat one another because on the internet it‚Äôs so easy to attack others with no fear of repercussions.

The first step in the right direction regarding this issue, in my opinion, is to start meeting up and talking to strangers. We‚Äôve had our third spaces taken away and everything is too costly so we just stay home. I aim to provide a solution to this issue, akin to AA or NA but without any specific affliction at the root of it. Just a free weekly meeting in a public space where we can voice whatever we feel the need to in the presence of a group of our peers. These sessions will not be argumentative: we will hear one another our civilly, and try to only provide our own opinions in a helpful discourse aimed at solving problems, not creating them.

First meeting I am thinking will be held at the Centennial Square Plaza this coming Saturday (Jan 11th) at 2 PM PST. 

I am hoping that once this group develops some traction I can start booking communal spaces and providing coffee, like how AA does.

This idea is a work in progress but I would greatly appreciate the involvement of any locals who are interested in something like this, if you‚Äôre curious please DM me.

Initially I was thinking it should be for people age 18-30 but I now feel it should be open to adults of any age as we‚Äôre all suffering the collective problems shared by society the same.

About a week ago, I started to get a sharp pain in my back molar (tooth with arrow in the photo) when I bit down really hard. Sometimes I get a bit of sensitivity when I eat or drink super sugary or acidic foods and don‚Äôt swish water afterwards but it usually goes away in a couple of days if I brush normally. My tooth has been hurting for a week now though so I‚Äôm a little worried. It also hurts a lot more than I‚Äôm used to with normal sensitivity. 

I brush twice a day, but I‚Äôm admittedly bad about flossing often. If I get something stuck in my teeth I do it but I don‚Äôt do it daily. I haven‚Äôt had a cavity in over a decade and my dentist always comments on how great my teeth are when I go in for my cleanings every six months especially since he also treats my mom and she doesn‚Äôt have the best dental genetics. 

I don‚Äôt smoke, drink alcohol maybe twice a month, and drink coffee 3-4 times a week. I do miss a brush maybe once a month if I‚Äôm traveling during my normal brushing time or if I accidentally fall asleep before doing my nighttime routine. I try to swish water after eating or drinking sugary/acidic foods.

I recently moved and am two months overdue for my biannual cleaning because I‚Äôve been trying to get into a new dentist‚Äôs office. I have an appointment coming up in a week where I plan to ask about my molar. 

Does this look like a cavity? 

If it does, can the dentist fix it / fill it during my cleaning or will I need to make another appointment? Is missing a brush once in a while a huge deal? Is there anything I can do before my appointment to make it not hurt?

Well I realized something by accident, it's because I'm sticking to my regular Intermittent fasting routine (Skipping breakfast) and my carb cravings keep winning, even when these specific carbs aren't even too impressive. 

When I started I did what I named the ""Stuffa yo face"" method. I ate a ton of eggs, bacon, beef, and bulletproof coffee. The fact that it was rich and decadent helped my brain not feel like it was missing out. 

Eating this much food might cause a person to gain weight! It seems like we're 5 pounds lighter but that's only because glucose is attached to water. So I say to myself ""Gain 2 pounds to lose 10.""

She was told it helped with adhd symptoms, which I struggle with and don‚Äôt like adderall. I fell in love and became Feel Free‚Äôs biggest supporter telling everyone about it. My dad and uncle both started using as well. I felt like my life was declining about a year ago and I‚Äôve never felt so depressed/ anxiety filled. I would drink a bottle a day as my ‚Äúmorning coffee‚Äù and it was the only thing giving me some type of relief. I also started experiencing extreme physical pain around 2 years ago and completely lost my period. I thought my mental was a cause of the physical pain I was experiencing and that the outside world was causing all of these problems. It got to a point where the voice inside my head was not my own, but I had yet to put the blame on FF as it was only the thing getting me through the day. It was once I got a hold of a huge supply of Tramadol. I would take one every 2 weeks as a treat, but I quickly lost that control and began taking them everyday. One tablet was 200mg and I was taking 2 a day so 400mg which is a lot. I did this for a month and I knew I was killing my self as I was tempted to start taking 3 tramadol a day (deadly amount). I decided to quit the tramadol as I have so much to live for.. I used FF a lot to get through the next 2 week, drinking 2 a day to just help with the suicidal thoughts. After 2 weeks of this, I decided I wanted to take my life back and quit FF cold turkey right then and there. That was the hardest thing I ever had to do. The urges are uncontrollable and the voice in my head trying to reason why we should go get one was so loud. It‚Äôs been 30 days and my life has changed. I wake up looking forward to my day, my body pain is almost fully gone as my body isn‚Äôt in a state of stress at all times, my period came back, and I started to enjoy the little things again. Some things that have really helped me is cold plunging and suana. The extreme conditions keep me in my body and give me a rush that is much better than that of FF. 

However, I still struggle with the voice in my head telling me to go grab a blue bottle. The reason I decided to share my story today is because all I want is to have a FF. The days leading up to this one have been great, but there are still some days that it is all I can think about.

I never thought it about that way, but she probably is. Does she make these snarky comments because she‚Äôs unhappy?

For context, my husband and I have been married less than two years and are in our 30s. No kids yet. Very much in a happy, lovey-dovey phase in our marriage. I‚Äôm enjoying it. 

I also know MIL disliked one of my husband‚Äôs brother‚Äôs wives. MIL was vocal about not liking her and blamed her for everything (e.g., ‚Äúshe keeps the house so messy‚Äù when her son lives there and could be cleaning too). BIL and ex-SIL separated before I was in the picture, and I heard from mutuals it‚Äôs because ex-SIL and MIL didn‚Äôt get along. I 100% believe it. 

In way, I feel better thinking of her as an unhappy person and that‚Äôs why she is the way she is. I‚Äôm still keeping her at arms-length, of course.

‚ÄúMust be nice‚Äù in a sarcastic tone when DH and I said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to each other. 

Mentions she wanted DH to marry his ex from 10 years ago when we were out shopping just the two of us. I decided after that we are no longer socializing without DH there too.

Edit: I did not intend this to be this long! Please be patient.

TL;DR Me (30F) and my BF (32M) are together for 5 years. We were work friends before we got together, we are still workmates now. We dated for about a year before making things official. At first we're okay.. but along the way there were issues that we are, i don't know, trying hard to resolve, but it looks like we cannot resolve them no matter how much we talked about it. and now, I'm here in this position where I'm not sure if I want to continue this or not.

Here are some things I think about:

* **He does not like my family.**¬†Family is important to me. I am close with his, and he is not with mine, they are more like acquaintances for him. He gives an effort to come to our family events, gives gifts on occassions¬†*(he piggybacks on my gifts)*¬†but i'll still count that as effort. But on occassions, he does not like them. Mostly because he does not like their type of jokes. Sometimes they do make bad jokes (ex.: they joke around saying¬†*""are you sure with my daughter?"" ""ahhh you should change your partner"")*¬†as someone (me) who is with them for a long time, I get their type of jest; but he does not. I understand his perspective on feeling bad on those jokes, I tried explaining to him that they are not serious with what they are saying, it's just their way of joking and to not take things to heart. I also understand he is not the type of person to let things like that go, which is why i'm constantly saying sorry to him on behalf of my family. But this is getting tiring for me, most likely for him too.
* **He does not like my friends.**¬†I have friends which go way back uni. My friends and I hangout from time to time, and everytime we hangout, they always ask me to bring him along - he does not want to come; and it is tiring to come up with excuses for him everytime. When I asked him why he does now want to come, he just told me that he does not jive with the stuff that me and my friends like (we like going to board games, mini games and the likes); sometimes we meet up for birthday dinners , but he does not want to come also, saying he does not connect with them. It frustrates me that he is always like that; I do not bring this up to him, since when we talked about it, it looks like there won't be changing his mind. Although he does not want, one time he went with me on the wedding of my friends, but it looks like it is a one time deal as whenever I asked him to come he always goes on saying ""I already indulged you when I came to the wedding"".
   * Maybe one factor is in that friend group is my ""ex"" (is it counted if we were not official? We tried but we did not work.) however, before we got together I already explained that situation with him. Somehow he accepted it, but with reservations. So I am trying to appease him, i have already put distance with myself and that specific friend of mine. and also now, that friend is already in a relationship, and I am also friends with his partner -- all in all we are okay, except for him (bf)
   * He seldom hangs out with his own friends, but when he does, he does not ask me to come. I would have if he asked. I don't know, the overthinker in me thinks that maybe that's his way of making me back off on asking him to come and hangout with my friends.
   * He does hangout with our friends with me -- these friends being our work friends.
* **He does not want to go out.**¬†He likes spending time with his computer, even his family tells me does he does not bond with them. I personally would like to go on dates, explore cafes, foods, places. I often send him links on things I want to do together, and he just says yes, but does not follow through. Whenever I asked him to go do those things, there is always reason not to. Or he always says, oh i want to rest. Weekends are the only days I can rest. (mind you we were working from home)
   * 2 years back, I opened up to him saying that I want us to go out and do stuff together, that I envy our friends with partners who goes out. I felt bad for myself having to say that to him.. those things, I should not have been feeling it. But if I don't tell him nothing will happen. After I told him that, he asked me to go out, we did. I thought, ahhh finally - but nothing followed.
   * We do go out. On our anniversary, on valentines day... when his family goes out, and invites me. When we have planned hangout with our workfriends.
   * I also told him that, we should hangout on other days, but he still goes ""but we see each other when we go to work"" (thats once a week, and we hardly talk as we're busy with our own work - we only bond when we get dinner or coffee, but not alone)",3,1736192062.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

## Rancilio Silvia Pro X: A Deep Dive into Espresso Perfection

The Rancilio Silvia Pro X isn't just an espresso machine; it's a statement.  For serious home baristas and small caf√© owners seeking professional-grade results, this dual-boiler marvel promises espresso perfection. But does it deliver? This in-depth review examines its features, performance, and overall value to help you decide if the Silvia Pro X is the right investment for your coffee journey.

### **Unpacking the Dual Boiler Advantage: Why Two Boilers Matter**

The core of the Silvia Pro X's appeal lies in its dual boiler system. Unlike single-boiler machines that struggle to maintain consistent temperature during both brewing and steaming, the Pro X excels.  Its two independent boilers, controlled by precise PID temperature controllers, eliminate the temperature surfing common in single-boiler models. This means consistent brewing temperatures for optimal espresso extraction and ample steam power for velvety microfoam, all simultaneously. The 0.3L insulated brass brewing boiler ensures rapid heating and stable temperature, while the 1L steam boiler, conveniently switchable off to save energy, provides the power needed for professional-quality latte art. This is a significant upgrade from the original Silvia, making it a compelling option for those seeking enhanced performance and control.

### **Precision and Control: Key Features of the Rancilio Silvia Pro X**

The Silvia Pro X is packed with features designed to elevate your espresso game:

* **PID Temperature Control:**  The precise PID controllers allow for meticulous temperature adjustments, essential for dialing in the perfect espresso shot. This level of control is often found only in high-end commercial machines.
* **Soft Infusion:** This innovative feature pre-infuses the coffee grounds before the full pump pressure is applied. This gentle pre-soak allows for even extraction and reduces channeling, resulting in a more nuanced and balanced espresso.
* **Professional-Grade Steam Wand:** The stainless steel steam wand is powerful and responsive, allowing for effortless texturing of milk and creation of stunning latte art.  Its robust build ensures longevity, a key factor for frequent use.
* **Brew Pressure Gauge:** The built-in pressure gauge provides real-time feedback on brewing pressure, allowing baristas to fine-tune their technique and achieve consistent extraction pressure. This is invaluable for understanding the relationship between grind size, dose, and extraction.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Despite its advanced capabilities, the Silvia Pro X boasts a surprisingly intuitive interface. The digital display and clearly labeled buttons make navigation straightforward, even for beginners. Features like the automatic shot timer and automatic backflush simplify the process and save time.
* **Hot Water Tap:** The inclusion of an independent hot water tap adds versatility, allowing you to easily prepare Americano or simply have hot water for tea.
* **Chromed Brass Portafilter:** The sturdy, chromed brass portafilter is designed for durability and provides a comfortable grip. Its capacity accommodates up to 21 grams of coffee, perfect for larger double shots.


### **Performance and User Experience: Real-World Impressions**

The Rancilio Silvia Pro X‚Äôs performance lives up to its promises. The dual boiler system consistently delivers stable temperatures, leading to more consistent shot quality. The 15-bar vibration pump provides the necessary pressure for optimal extraction, and the pressure gauge allows for precise monitoring.  The soft infusion feature noticeably improves extraction, resulting in richer, more nuanced espresso.

Ease of use is another strong point.  The machine‚Äôs intuitive design and automatic features make it accessible to baristas of all levels.  Even beginners can quickly master the basics and produce impressive results. Cleaning and maintenance are relatively straightforward, further enhancing its user-friendliness.

The build quality is excellent. The brushed stainless steel housing is both durable and aesthetically pleasing, adding a touch of professional flair to any kitchen.

### **Comparing the Silvia Pro X to the Competition: Is it Worth the Price?**

The Rancilio Silvia Pro X sits in a competitive price bracket, around $2000.  While this is a significant investment, it's justified by its superior performance and features compared to many competitors.  Machines in a similar price range may offer some overlapping functionalities, but the combination of dual boilers, PID control, soft infusion, and a professional-grade steam wand sets the Silvia Pro X apart.  Consider other high-end home espresso machines like the Rocket Appartamento or Profitec Pro 600, but carefully weigh the features and functionalities against your specific needs and budget.


### **Addressing Common Concerns and Misconceptions**

* **Price Point:** The higher price tag might be a deterrent for some. However, considering the machine's longevity, consistent performance, and advanced features, it represents a long-term investment rather than a mere expense.
* **Maintenance:**  Regular maintenance is crucial for any espresso machine.  However, the Silvia Pro X's design makes cleaning and descaling relatively easy.
* **Learning Curve:** While user-friendly, mastering the nuances of espresso extraction still requires practice and experimentation.  However, the machine's features, such as the pressure gauge and PID control, aid in this learning process.


### **Conclusion:  A Worthy Investment for Espresso Enthusiasts**

The Rancilio Silvia Pro X delivers on its promise of espresso perfection. Its dual-boiler system, advanced features, and user-friendly interface make it a top contender for home baristas and small caf√© owners who demand consistent, high-quality espresso. While the price point is higher than entry-level machines, the superior performance, build quality, and long-term value make it a worthwhile investment for those serious about their coffee.  If you're ready to elevate your espresso game, the Rancilio Silvia Pro X is a machine worth considering.  It's an investment in quality, consistency, and the pursuit of the perfect shot.

Don't get me wrong, we're having fun and it isn't all bad, but we definitely approach the issue of chores differently. And they're gluttonous. I'm trying to ration the food out correctly so that we have enough for our stay here, but they seem to be like bottomless pits when it comes to eating. They finished the coffee in like 3 days when it should've lasted us more than a week. It seems like they're trying to finish up al our food as soon as they can just for the sake of eating.

But im also just coming to the realization that I might be to high strung for this. I feel more comfortable when I'm at home with my family because we've lived all our lives together, but here I find myself getting a bit too irritable when they don't do stuff without me having to direct them in some way. I won't lie and act like they've been the absolute worst , but I think I like having things done a certain way and if it isn't done that way, I feel wronged.

To start off I‚Äôm MtF with 6 months on hrt. Whenever I look at my reflection as a whole I can‚Äôt help but see my agab, however I‚Äôve been recently noticing that when I look at myself in separate pieces I can kinda see more feminine traits.

Today I was having dinner with my dad and I was sitting in front of the microwave, which has a mirror door, however I could only see from my neck down unto around where my ribs end and when I looked at that reflection I could genuinely see a female shape, my shoulders looked curved and gentle, my neck looked soft, my arms looked nice and I could barely see the hint of my growing chest. I‚Äôve had moments like that too, where I see just the top part of my face and think that I could pass as fem; or at my legs and see the more typically traditional feminine figure. My issue is that whenever I see the full picture I can‚Äôt see any of that, I see the opposite with broad shoulders and a cube body and a more masc face.

This has been quite an issue for a while now and it‚Äôs becoming a bit distressing. People keep calling me ma‚Äôam or lady when I go out and buy a coffee or pay at a register (until I speak and hear a still not fem voice), but my mind keeps telling me otherwise and that I‚Äôm not fem at all. I don‚Äôt know how to help my mind make that change and accept that I‚Äôm starting to get feminine traits and to fully see myself in that light rather than only being able to in segments.

A bit recently though, I think I did something wrong. I‚Äôm overthinking probably; to them, they‚Äôre probably not thinking much about it, but to me, I feel like they think I‚Äôm weird and that they hate me now. I asked if they were gay.
We were talking about how some guy looked really similar to this character. And I said ‚Äòmen are so beautiful‚Äô, and they agreed. I took this as a chance, not even thinking, to ask if they were gay. I asked it exactly like this: ‚Äòthis is gonna sound so out of nowhere, only answer if you want (are you a boykisser?).‚Äô I tried asking in an indirect, polite tone and I tried giving them the option to just ignore the question if they‚Äôre uncomfortable.

It took a while to encourage her to seek treatment in the first place. I also spent a lot of time trying to empathize with and listening to her problems. Sometimes I even picked up her calls in the middle of the night in case she was struggling. I would try to take her out for coffees, dinners, etc. without expecting anything in return. I would also often excuse some of her negative behaviors. For example, she didn't have the capacity to really empathize with me as frequently and I accepted that given her mental health. I knew it was a more one-sided friendship where I am the more nurturing/caring friend. However, there were times where things would get difficult. I would discover she wasn't always completely transparent with me and I realized she was sort of using me in a way. She also sometimes threw jabs at me that hurt at times to even lead me to tears but I ignored it. My last straw was when she kept calling me after I told her I am dealing with an emergency to share something I had repeatedly advised her to distance herself from for her own good. It seemed to me at a point that she was really creating her own problems by going back to things that weren't good for her, not taking her medications and refusing to get proper treatment on multiple occasions. Then act entitled and say ""well I will get fixed when I want to, that's my right"". I think I was in disbelief when she called me that day because she knew I was in a bad situation and she only thought of herself and decided it was more important to share her minor issue that I felt she brought upon by herself while I was in the middle of a dilemma. I really lost it at that point and asked her why this couldn't wait? Her response was that because it was important for HER. Just FYI that she called me multiple times before I picked up. I only picked up because I was worried she was in an emergency herself only to find out she was not sharing anything urgent or life threatening. I told her I couldn't do this anymore and have distanced myself from her since that day. I know she wants to use her OCD and psychosis as an excuse for her behavior and I really do feel bad for her mental health struggles but I just felt I couldn't do it anymore.

ü•ë **Fantastic Fats:** Avocado, nuts, or seeds for long-lasting energy.

* **Cheese & Nut Clusters:** Crunchy, salty, and satisfying.

* **Chia Pudding:** A pudding that fuels and cools‚Äîlike dessert with a purpose.

# What to Skip

üö´ High-sugar treats (sugar rush = sugar crash!).

1hv6xah,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1hv6xah/2025_this_is_the_year/,"2025, this is the year. ","Long story short, in 2023 I ended a 6 year relationship my girlfriend. We were unhappy for a while and the arguments were increasing by the week. I finally got the guts to move out of the apartment we had together. 

I didn‚Äôt even own a car, all I had when I moved in was one of my luggage‚Äôs and a 4-5 black bags of miscellaneous stuff I had. The first week I slept on the floor until I got a mattress delivered. Got a bed frame some time after that. I vividly remembering moving in and having nothing in my place. 

I was still working my white collar job, but I started to grow a strong distaste for it. The area I was working in was not interesting nor were my skills being properly used. I always considered myself a hard worker, but as the days went by, my effort dwindled and I wanted a change. In two separate occasions with management, I expressed to them that I wanted to change teams or practice areas. I was told a switch was not possible but they‚Äôd try their best to give me assignments that aligned with my skill set. Of course that never occurred and I took it upon myself to find a job that I wanted. 

Slowly but surely I started purchasing this for my apartment. I started dating for fun again and met a lot of wonderful girls. After having some fun, I wanted to get serious and start dating with purpose. After doing the dating thing for sometime, I met the most beautiful and genuine girl in the world. I think the absolute world of her. 


Summer 2024 my gf and I were discussing moving in together. I was still at my current job and my job search was futile. I had one off interviews that never really materialized into follow up interviews or offers. After one interview over zoom early in the morning, I went in to the office of my current job. I noticed I had a calender invite with the partner, completely random out of the blue. Because of industry experience, I knew it was probably a meeting to let me go. I rescheduled the meeting for a couple hours later and prepared myself mentally for the news. Sure enough, on the call later that day, the partner was with HR and I was told I would be let go. July 15 was my last day. 

I felt a sense of relief to be out of the job I did not want, but I also felt stressed knowing I did not have a job aligned and I might have to settle for something that I did not want ultimately. Miraculously, from the interview earlier that morning, I was followed up with two additional interviews with team members the following week. 

About a week later I was told the interviews went well and the company made a verbal offer over the phone. I was elated and I felt a huge sense of accomplishment and relief. Unfortunately, the company recruiter got back to me a week later saying that the position was filled internally and that information was not shared with her until very recently. 

I was distraught and at a loss of words. I was at my gf‚Äôs house and she asked what had happened. I told her that I don‚Äôt have the job offer anymore and she genuinely thought I was playing a game on her. Once she saw the emotion in my face, she understood me to be telling the truth. While on the phone with the company recruiter, I remained calm and respectful at all times. She sounded genuine in saying sorry and I did not think for one moment she set me up. 

The next two weeks I was all over the internet and LinkedIn grinding out job applications. I sent many job applications, cold call messages to recruiters, contacts, old coworkers, and people in industry hoping to get a lead. 

After sometimes, the old company recruiter emailed me asking if I wanted to chat about a similar job opportunity. By now, this is around end of August, give or take. I took her offer to chat and I learned that a position I originally interviewed for in March, was currently seeking someone to fill the position. I expressed my interest and availability to interview. After two casual interviews, one over coffee and another over lunch, I was offered in writing, a job that I have been trying to get for 6+ months and was offered nearly $60K more than my old employer. Best believe I signed that contract within 24 hours and returned it to the company. 

I started my new job October of 2024, a week after my gf and I moved in to our own place together. Ever since then, everything has been great. My new job can be challenging at times and the days can be long, but the work interests me as it is something that aligns with my skill set and interest. The relationship is going strong and is definitely a long term thing. 

After the difficulty in 2023 with respect to ending a relationship and moving out, to getting fired in 2024, I just feel those trials and tribulations have set me up to be successful in 2025. Extremely grateful for the opportunity to live a healthy life and have healthy relationship. I‚Äôm grateful to be employed and have the chance to work in area that interests me and compensates me fairly. I do not care that some days can be challenging or hard, because those days have nothing on what I felt in my lowest of lows.

I'm not really a new year resolutions gal but my partner and I were inspired by a few friends to do the Hard 75 challenge, not specifically for the new year but the timing works out really well to get us in shape for Coachella. Starting today, we'll be done with the challenge on March 22. For those who haven't heard of it, it involves multiple daily goals: 2 workouts (one outdoors), a healthy diet (which you can pretty much define for yourself), no alcohol, reading non-fiction, water intake, and a progress picture. We are starting today. There are some free Hard 75 apps you can download to help you track things. There are also ""medium"" and ""soft"" versions that are more lenient if that feels more realistic for you. I'm a big proponent of setting realistic goals so I modified my daily non-outdoor workout goal to be at least 30 mins instead of 45 mins. I'm also doing 75oz of water instead of a gallon. My definition of ""healthy diet"" for the purposes of this challenge will be no nutrition-less snacks, maximum 1 sweet drink in a week (which I will probably use on getting a Viet Coffee on the weekend or something), and eating out max 3 meals per week. Hopefully some of y'all find the idea of this challenge interesting and can join in on it :)

* Vibe: Equal parts sarcastic and sweet, like a candy cane dipped in that espresso.
* Hobbies:üé¨ Binge-watching TV shows until Netflix asks, ‚ÄúAre you still watching?‚Äù (Yes, I am, stop judging me.)üéß Making playlists with songs that feel like main-character energy. üç≥ Cooking experiments that sometimes result in genius‚Ä¶ and sometimes result in delivery.üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Attempting yoga poses that my body clearly wasn‚Äôt built for but laughing through it anyway.

What I‚Äôm looking for:Someone who can make me laugh until I snort (bonus points if it‚Äôs over a bad pun). If you love music, movies, or gaming, we‚Äôll get along just fine. A little sass, a little banter, and a lot of fun‚Äîthat‚Äôs the dream, right?
Oh, and if you like deep conversations one day and arguing about whether pineapple belongs on pizza the next (it does, fight me), we‚Äôre probably a match made in meme heaven.

Why you should message me:
* I‚Äôll send you random, funny memes at 2 a.m. because sleep is overrated.
* I‚Äôll absolutely hype you up like a personal cheerleader when you need it.
* I know exactly how to ruin perfectly good New Year‚Äôs resolutions, and I‚Äôm more than willing to share my secrets.
* Let‚Äôs face it, life‚Äôs more fun with a partner-in-crime.

There are this little wooshes and wabbles the coffee does as the cup is moved a certain way and it sloshes around. 

I remember learning about some of this kind of stuff, and I always try and picture it when I drink my coffee, what exactly is going on down there? I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs entirely mundane, though I find the mundane magically entertaining to think about.

Can anyone provide their best description of events within a cup of coffee as I lift it, sip from it, and set it back down? 
How does friction play a role? 
What is the heat doing? 
Is the steam I see just water molecules? 
Do the liquid molecules slide over each other or are they more like rolling over each other? 

Bonus question: what makes for the best kind of thermos?

We became fast friends, and I later quit my software engineering job to help with this new community named Around The Corner ([www.aroundthecorner.today](https://www.aroundthecorner.today/?ref=rcn)).

I had built an online community for talking to strangers which was a huge part of the previous 5 years of my life. With my experience being overwhelmingly positive but challenging, I equipped myself with a grocery bag full of books to lend, and met this internet stranger at a neighborhood cafe (shoutout Blue Hummingbird).¬†

We both held a fundamental belief that humanity is filled with good, and uniquely fascinating people. That our lives are enriched by sharing our stories with those around us, and we were driven to share our experience with as many people as possible.

It turns out we were not alone. Over 2,000 people have since registered, with 700 coffee matches to date. We‚Äôve thrown 15 social events, with many more planned in Orange County and the San Francisco Bay area (where the project originated).

This month marks the 1 year anniversary since the launch of our website.¬† üéâ

So there‚Äôs a guy I met via Instagram that I thought was extremely cute. I had asked him about his band and ended up being a little flirty towards the end. 2 weeks passed with no reply and I chalked it up to him either not being interested/ or because he didn‚Äôt know me. He randomly asked me out for coffee which then turned into a 3 week talking period where we got to know each other, talked about dates we were going to go on, flirted, he gave me his number, etc. We had plans for me to attend one of his bands shows later in the week and I was so excited. 

Randomly he sent me this message: ‚ÄúI feel really embarrassed by this but I had some realizations this weekend about where I am mentally when it comes to getting to know you in this flirty  and expectant way. This is definitely stemming from the fact that I got out of a relationship not all that long ago. It‚Äôs been a few months and when I messaged you I thought I was done and moved on from it, but I was just hit with a ton of emotional bricks this weekend while I was driving to and from DC. That‚Äôs really why you haven‚Äôt heard from me too much the last few days. I truly was occupied all day and late into Saturday night, but I was also trying to process things amidst it all. Maybe this is way too long winded than usual necessary with how little we know each other, but I didn‚Äôt want you to think there was anything personal about these feelings. I‚Äôm actually really bummed because you‚Äôve been so fun to talk with, you ask good questions, appear to be  genuinely interested in things that I do, and seems like we would have a lot of common interests. I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm feeling comfortable continuing getting to know you in this way while I‚Äôm having these feelings because I don‚Äôt want to ignore them and just end up leading you on too long and playing with your emotions (or worse‚Ä¶ steal your secret thrifting spots). I think we‚Äôve all been in that situation and nobody deserves that. So to put it plainly I think there‚Äôs some stability I need to find within myself before I start trying to put myself back out there. I‚Äôm really sorry :/‚Äú

It seemed very sincere and genuine. I told him in my own message all was good and I understand that he needed time. He told me to still come to the show. We met at the show, had a few nice friendly conversations, and I left. Over the past 1.5 months or so, we‚Äôve texted a couple times but the last two texts I sent were left on read so I haven‚Äôt said anything else. On New Year‚Äôs Eve I attended one his bands shows with some friends and he ended up waving at me and we ended up talking for over an hour. His friends left to go to another party and he stayed back. My friends left and then he and I talked awhile longer and then he gave me a ride home. I asked if he wanted to come in and meet my cat but he said he was really tired which was legitimate and it was very late anyway so I understood. Since then he has not texted me, it‚Äôs been about 4 days. 

My dilemma is that I really like him and am super attracted to him. He seems to like me at least platonically and obviously found me attractive at one point since we were in a talking stage. On nye he was smiling and laughing a lot and we got along great. I want to respect his boundaries and not continue to persue him or initiate texting but I‚Äôm also becoming very impatient and would like to know if there‚Äôs any chance for the future if I stay in his orbit or if I should just give up and move on. What do you think is the best route here? I‚Äôm still keeping my options open but I tend to hyperfixate on one person at a time and I‚Äôve never been in a situation like this where it‚Äôs kind of a gray area. Guys either reject me straight up or they like me and we see where it goes. Not sure how to handle this. ",1,1736189217.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1hv6d9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1hv6d9a/the_holidays_shouldnt_be_a_drain_on_your_marriage/,The holidays shouldn't be a drain on your marriage.,"But sometimes they are.

My wife (32f) and I (33m), have 3 kids (11m, 9f, 7f). We are truly madly in love. We can't keep our hands off of each other after 12 years of marriage. We have sex daily, often for hours. We're religious about dates and weekends away, we can talk forever, it's truly wonderful and it gets better every year.

Her parents live 1500 miles away, and they stayed with us from Christmas Eve through New Years Eve. My wife has a good but often tenuous relationship with her parents, and being near them stirs up a lot of emotion, not even to mention the fact that it's difficult to let go for sex when your parents and in-laws are in the house. It was a nice week, the kids enjoyed it, I'm glad we did it, but we missed our time together and  the space to process the feelings her parents were stirring up. We clung to each other as much as we could, but it was straining.

It's notable as well that when her parents arrived she was wrapping up her period, and she had particularly rough PMS this month. We had some challenging moments, and while we maintained intimacy, it was just a difficult week. So by the time her parents left and she was fully post-period, feeling great physically and emotionally... we were pretty ravenous for each other.

They leave on NYE and then we celebrated with friends and family, making New Years Day mostly a recovery day. When we woke up on Thursday I basically said hey. We have 4 more days of ""holidays"" here. We have no plans, no more Christmas parties, nothing. I'm claiming these days. Let's end these holidays on the best note.

And so commenced 4 days of chatting, coffee on the porch, hot tub and cold plunge, extended sessions of yoga, massages, ordering in, and hours and hours and hours of soul-bending, heart-changing, mind-melting sex. The kids got more screen time than normal and we found a nearby friend to take them for awhile each day, but also found time to do puzzles, play video games and connect with them. I feel so full, so content, so ready for whatever the week brings. I feel like we're completely different people than we were a week ago, way looser and goofier and jelloy-er. I'll remember this holiday season with so much more fondness after this, such a nice ending note.

Don't forget each other during vacations, holidays, special occasions. Don't just pour out. Care for each other. Fill each other up. If you and your partner just poured out over this season, find some time in the next few weeks to reconnect. Your families don't want you killing yourselves to make the holidays happen at the expense of your marriage.

I want to get a TV but currently the room isn't that comfy/ nice to spend time in so it feels like a waste.

Basically I'd really appreciate some help on the best way to layout this room to fulfil dual living & dining room roles. I want to move the sofa nearer the TV stand as they are currently fairly distant but then one thing or the other ends up lost in the middle of the room - how do i avoid this?

There's a small budget for buying other things (maybe coffee tables) but I don't really want too much as i'm not hugely settled where I'm living right now.

Sorry the pictures suck!

The cake is pretty tasty but my friend hates coffee and always has. Despite knowing his coffee-hating son his (the son's) entire life, boomer dad has sent him mocha cakes for the last 4 Christmases.

ETA: The first Christmas he received a mocha cake, my friend did remind his father he hates coffee. A year later when he received *two* mocha cakes, my friend explained that it isn't worth the effort to try and get his father to stop, since he can just give the cakes to people that will eat them (like myself).

SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM FOR THE POLL. REDDIT USED TO PUT IT AT THE TOP


Best of luck to us all!


[Bonus section: 2024 Monthly accomplishments related to voice acting. It's a long read but if you need some motivation, and work a day job like I do, you might just feel like you aren't alone on this journey.]

Jan '24: Let friends, family, and coworkers know that I am doing this as a career, not a hobby. 

Feb '24 Moved to a new location, same town, quieter neighborhood, better for recording at home. (Also buying normal house essentials like a coffee maker and bookshelf etc.)

Mar '24 Research Microphones, and home recording spaces, at an affordable cost. (Save money during this month.)

Apr '24 Build home booth (under $200). Used one of those metal closet clothes rack frames, where you just screw each pole together. Easy to undo when moving next time. Bought 3 moving blankets from big hardware store. Also bought clamps for .99c to hold them up. Bought LED lights that stick to the metal, with a removable, rechargeable battery. 
Decided a shotgun mic was probably the best way to mitigate sounds from neighbors. I asked, live, on the VOBS show ""What mic should I get"" without enough info and George was able to refer the Audio Technica AT875R. It was $170 at the time, and it is a great mic, for me anyway. Also, from watching VOBS, I learned of the Irig Pre HD. It is an inteface that lets you connect to your mic, and to your phone.Android and Iphone. (If you buy one, make sure it's the right one, because some are usb, and some are a 3.5 mm jack.) It has a gain knob and also allows you to plug in headphones to direct monitor what's coming out. Good for testing your sound environment to find the best place to setup. Lastly, I got a mic stand from a  local music store for $15. It bends and turns so I don't need to readjust the mic itself.

May '24 Do free trials of DAWs on my phone, as well as on my laptop.Took alot if time finding the right ones that work for me. I hate to say it, but as complicated as it is, adobe audition makes the most sense to me, on PC. (I considered an ipad or Mac, this is just the equipment I had at the time.) On the phone, USB Audio Recorder PRO is the app that had a trial but only cost $4 to buy permanently and it works, currently in 2025. I also can practice in the car on my lunchbreak. I am able to fit the mic, and the interface,into my glovebox. The mic even came with a sock on it.

Jun '24 Practice reading any copy on mic. The goal was just to get used to the sound of my own voice, and to be more mindful of any things that came up performance wise. Such as general mic technique, speaking off axis, or using the ASL letter ""Y"" method. (You put your thumb on your lip, and pinky at the mic.) That's typical distance for me at least. Also, on the site iwanttobeavoice actor, there are many free articles of copy, in different genres of acting that I was able to try out. 

Jul '24 Took a vacation. While on vacation, listen to voice acting podcasts while driving, (and while doing chores in general or running errands). However, while doing actual vacation activities, and spending time with love ones, I made sure to turn my acting brain off and enjoy life. Only used phone for GPS and essential texts between family. And photos of course, lots of photos.

Aug '24 Not gonna lie, this month was busy with my day job. I wasn't practicing as much as I should have. I did make an effort to listen to voice acting podcasts, or browse this subreddit to see what's going on in the world. In general, work and sleep.

Sep ''24 Another busy month at day job. Could have also been the hot weather, but in general, it was hard to stay focused on voice acting when so much was going on IRL. However, something inside me needed to keep going, so, at least on weekends, I dedicated my mornings to practice copy, and listened to more podcasts while doing chores and errands.

Nov '24 This month was super busy at my day job until Black Friday. After that, it was like a clearing between the fog. Suddenly, I was free, to get back to doing what I loved. Back to scipt practice and mic technique. Also, should have mentioned I have been playing around with different characters on copy. Trying to extend my instrument, find out what characters I could do, and find out what accents were easy for me to do, and to see if I sounded similar to any videogame or sitcom characters. I started having fun again.

Dec '24 
First two weeks of the month were busy, but fine at the day job. Once holiday break started, it was a voice acting vacation for me. I was diligent, every morning and evening dedicated to practicing. I visited family and friends, and they all politely asked ""how's that voice thing going?"" and I said ""Great! 2025 is going to be my year.""

And so, here we are, Round 2. If you read this far, I say thanks, and if you are at the same stage I'm at, I say, let's do it! Here's my goals, and I hope you can accomplish them too!

1. Take a class, get coaching, and or join a workout group. (I feel like I have learned enough from free resources that I am ready to start taking direction and learning whatever else I have been missing. )
2. Find my signature sound. (My goal is video game voice acting, but commercials seem like fun. I want honest opinions about what I sound like. Young, old, dad, teen, chill, energetic, mellow, annoyed etc. Once I know what people think of my natural voice, I will be better equipped to approach certain pieces of copy.) This doesn't mean to pigeon hole myself, but rather, save time and not audition for things that I don't sound like. For example, I don't think I can sound like an old man, except as a joke. But maybe people think I do sound old.
3. Launch a website, and YouTube channel. On top of that, have a business card. People can't find you or send you auditions, if you aren't putting yourself out there. I know demos go there, but I don't feel like I am ready to make a demo yet. I need more training and coaching. At least having a business card with my website on it can let people know I am willing to work.

These 3 are a good start. However, long term goals also include:
4. Take an improv class.
5. Take a singing or similar vocal performance art class. (I hear the head voice and chest voice difference can save you vocal strain or stress, and allow you to perform sounds easier.
6. Look into local studios and start making contact.

And even longer term goals:

1.Demo made when I am actually ready, and have a roster of characters I can do with ease. (This could be end of the year or even next year.)
2. Consider all other performance options (Try to avoid P2P unless they aren't scammy A.I. stuff. It has to make sense and not a job for $5. Kind of a last resort)
3. Eventually get an agent so I can have a chance to audition for those video game jobs.


And that's everything I have to say, today. Thank you.

See it wasn't always this way, and I'm not even in my 30s so don't assume that I must be ancient.

No, in just a few years *things* can change. 

Bali used to be this unexplored, lush jungle where you could hostel or even get a villa for a few dollars a day. 

Now it's beaches are filled with trash, and the air quality is horrible due to excessive amounts of trash burning. Not just from the tourists or digital nomads mind you, but the entire renewable energy scam.

No dummy, don't jump to conclusions, i don't mean that i don't believe in renewable energy, just that the Energy complex sends a bunch of trash overseas just to end up burned.

So Bali is probably fuqqed in a few years from now, unless excessive change is made to combat air pollution and overall pollution.

But I doubt its as bad I make it out to be, the earth is resilient and so are it's people.

But its for this reason that I dislike people. I'm not a misanthrope but people can be really stupid, right?

People will always put their selfish needs, needs that hurt others or hurt their bottom line first. It's not a benevolent sort of self care, its selfish and greedy.

Anyway, Bali is still mostly cool, I have a friend visiting there right about now, he likes to hop between Dubai and Bali. 

I'll probably be making the move to Dubai myself, but I've got a few things to wrap up first.

And yeah Dubai gets a bad wrap. Like being a super conservative islamic country(it's loosened up), plastic city(in the sense that its soulless), and that the people who intentionally go there are soulless.

This is stupid thinking. 

See the majority of people who go there do so to *not pay taxes*. If you're financially illiterate you probably don't realize that as an American you probably pay at least 1/3 of your paycheck to the government.

More if you make more, so essentially you perform free labor for uncle sam. 

This wouldn't be an issue if the government fulfilled it's end of the social contract. You know, that thing you learned in government or history class(if you were paying attention). 

in case you forgot, it means you give up some of *your* rights( like vigilante justice) to the government so *they* can arrest people.

It's a lot more nuanced than that but you're free to read up on enlightenment era thinkers.

It's *supposed* to be an equal value exchange but year after year, personally, I feel scammed. Like the government are just gangsters asking me to run my pockets after I worked hard in the office.

We have inferior education, healthcare, safety, and a shyt political climate, on top of the insane taxes.

It's nearly impossible now to build wealth unless you make six figures and live in these flyover states. 

A notable figure always says ""go where you're treated best"" and it's a true statement.

It means go to the country with *less taxes, with more freedoms, with more safety.*

Look at **Monaco**, its extremely wealthy and they pay no taxes. a tax Haven for the super rich.

You think those guys want to move anywhere where they're taxed?

I've got friends all over the middle east and one in Dubai is right now doing $20k per month tax free!

He's got a private clientless community with a focus on programming. Makes 6 figures from the community and 6 figures from his job, combined around 20k USD per month.

He has very little expenses besides rent(which is cheap $1-1.5k) and a meal delivery service for his food at $200 per month. He's from the U.K as well so he isn't doubly taxed.

Oh did i not mention? YES, the united states will tax foreign earned income. It's the only country besides Eritrea and fuqqing NORTH KOREA, you know, that fuqqing DICTATORSHIP? 

There is a slight loophole where if you make under 110k(adjusted for inflation) and live outside the country you can quality for tax exclusion.

Imagine how much further you'd be ahead though if you had no taxes, great healthcare and a great education. Its time to reevaluate your loyalty to any country if it taxes you and can't provide those things.

Thats why I disdain diehard patriots, who are loyal for loyalties sake. What are you a dog? Even when their country has bent them down to take it from the back with no lube, they allow it to happen.

Why the hell did we fight the British for? More taxes? lol.

Anyway, this was all prompted by this guy i know who went to Bali a little over a decade ago, when again, Bali was undiscovered and these instagram losers didn't pollute and overrun the place.

I couldn't imagine going to canggu now unless I was an investor. Or unless they fix their fuqqing roads and expedite traffic. Just too much overcrowding right now to make it meaningful.

Like Paris, a lot of the allure is gone.

If you ever think of going to Bali, don't got to Lombok instead. Its Bali 10 years ago. quieter, cleaner with less people, and cheaper to boot.

The guy i was mentioning went to Bali with like two thousand dollars in his bank account, a camera and nothing else but the clothes off his back.

Today he's a multimillionaire and of the biggest youtubers in the travel space?

I'm not going to name drop him cuz i don't like doing that. But he's doing well for himself today.

How'd he do it? Remember, Bali was dirt cheap then, you could rent a whole villa for a month for a couple dollars a night, with breakfast and lunch. 

Don't believe me? Read this following excerpt from the new York times dated 1998(tbf a little more than a decade). 

*""I LEANED back lazily in my hammock and surveyed the panorama from my private veranda: coconut palms and mango trees in sizzling jungle greens, cascades of purple trumpet vines and pale-yellow frangipani, a tropical explosion of foliage that would have kept Gauguin working overtime for a month. While waiting for breakfast to arrive, I mulled over the day's options: A massage and body scrub? Shopping? My thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of a mug of industrial-strength, locally grown coffee and a big plate of juicy pineapple and papaya. It was all impossibly sweet and delicious, but for a frugal traveler there was something even sweeter about this cottage in the central hills of Bali: the price tag. It was $2.85 a night, breakfast and tax included, at the prevailing rate of 14,000 rupiah to the dollar"".*

$2.85 dollars per night for bed/breakfast and a villa! Today you'd be a lucky to get a hostel bunk bed for 30 dollars per night. 

And to be fair, that is still quite cheap and people still go to Bali.

The guy i mentioned by the way became that way because of his mindset. He went to Bali with the intention of going Monk mode, decreasing his expenses so that he could focus on filming and being an influencer. 

By the time his money(that $2,000) ran out, he was making enough from the Bali bubble back in like 2015. 

He took a chance, put his effort into filming and bought his one way flight determined to change his life.

When was the last time you wanted something this bad? Not even enough to uproot your whole life, but just to give yourself a chance at something better?

What will it take for you to bet on yourself when everything is on the internet to be learned *for free*, and can be learned part-time?

The answers probably as simple as the fact that you don't want it bad enough.

That's why guys that are poorer than you, not as smart as you, and not even as decent looking, lap you.

I'll be damned if I let that happen to me.

1hv652v,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXADHD/comments/1hv652v/what_can_i_expect_from_a_formal_diagnosis/,What can I expect from a formal diagnosis?,"Hi all!

I‚Äôve been lurking on Reddit for quite some time on various subs, including this one. I‚Äôm wondering what a formal diagnosis could provide and what that journey looks like? Should I go the psychiatric route or just to my GP? I have various reasons to believe I do have ADHD.

HEREDITARY - I know ADHD can be genetic or hereditary, and I definitely am predisposed to it given certain things I‚Äôve seen my father do throughout the years. How he handles the unexpected situations and his moodiness are some areas I try to tone down or bring more awareness to so I can be in control of how I react.

ADHD + ANXIETY - Of course people of my father‚Äôs generation do not believe in therapy or medicine to treat behavioral ailments so he definitely medicated with nicotine for a long time and caffeine with like multiple cups of coffee a day. For me I had to give up coffee. I stick to tea and people think I‚Äôve done some gargantuan feat. While the truth is, coffee only contributed to my anxiety, and I had to cut down on my caffeine intake significantly to keep my anxiety in check.

SKINPICKING  + ANXIETY - For as long as I could remember, I had an overwhelming sense of anxiety, social anxiety, and skinpicking tendencies. In my teenage years, my acne lent itself well to my skinpicking habit which led to alot of acne scarring. Now that I‚Äôm older and my acne has subsided, i have scabs in my ears where I suppose no one can see which i can pick away at. And sometimes in addition to the picking, the burning sensation is oddly satisfying. When the stress or anxiety gets to be too much, I definitely pick out my hair from the crown of my head but i try to keep that to a minimum.  

I‚Äôve been labeled a daydreamer and through many of the different transitions in my life I have faced them with great difficulty. I‚Äôve overcome them with a great amount of gumption and nothing else whether it was transitioning from school to school or the high school to college transition, those were always difficult. I just chalked it up to - well aren‚Äôt those transitions just difficult for everyone?

BINGE-EATING - Added to this I‚Äôve always had binge eating as one of my self-soothing tricks. of course that‚Äôs contributed to a roller coaster of a relationship w/weight where I can be super focused and take off a lot of weight which amazes everyone, myself included. And then on the flipside, I gain a lot of weight as well. 

I have a niece through marriage, who reminds me a lot of myself, and she‚Äôs on Vyvanse and managing a little better. I haven‚Äôt discussed it with her because honestly I don‚Äôt really want my personal information being broadcast to that side of the family, understandably. I‚Äôm wondering if a formal diagnosis will give me coping mechanisms or perhaps you know going the prescription route which I‚Äôm not entirely sure of, could help me as well.

I know this is more of a stream of consciousness type of post, but with all these thoughts in my mind, will a formal diagnosis help me? How could it help me? any words of advice or wisdom on what managing this more actively could look like ? Truly appreciate the help and insight. üíï",2,1736188604.0,TwoXADHD,2,1.0,False

After weeks of trying to sleep with the Air Mini, I finally have a solution that works for me.

I constantly was battling ultra-dry sinuses and keep waking up due to it. Those little pucks do nothing, but after much trial-and-error, I finally found a method that works. 

First, I soak the humidx plus puck into a cup of distilled water. Before, the puck would dry out
completely within an hour and I‚Äôd always wake up with sore sinuses and in complete pain because it just hurt to breath. The next step prevents it from completely drying out.

I also drape a clean damp towel over the intake of the Air Mini and all my woes disappeared. A room humidifier does nothing. I actually placed the air mini right on top of the humidifier and i thought I broke it. I couldn‚Äôt breathe as the complete opposite happened (mask filled with water, and the air mini operated oddly with inconsistent pressure and the auto functions stopped working).

That damp towel fixed it all. (will use a clean towel soaked with distilled water every time now).

No more dry sinuses. I woke up today after a restful sleep and I wasn‚Äôt in pain for once. I woke up automatically and was in disbelief that I woke up before my alarm and just completely alert. My fitbit app says I got 1.5 hours of deep sleep with full cycles of sleep. I had very low O2 variations for the first time (lower the better meaning my o2 levels were constant all night), and had a clean graph of the 4 cycles of sleep. 

I got a 100 score on the airmini app.

I saw u/researcherofcoffee 's post about EXP001 (THANK YOU‚Äîwould you mind posting it here?) in r/pourover and saw another person mention they might write a review.

I started Experimental with the aim of building a community of coffee drinkers who could engage in a feedback loop with farmers. The general idea is that **we** taste coffee and connect with farmers to give them our feedback. I wanted to do this for a few reasons, one of the main ones is that my time in the coffee industry has taught me that professionals' and consumers' preferences for coffee are sometimes very different. But it's often only the professionals who inform what goes on via cupping, scoring, and relationships with farmers. I wanted to disrupt that. And I think the time is right with how much experimentation is going on at farms. This is also a way to directly support farmers.

So, with that context, I'd love if you posted a review (good, bad, ugly, it's all welcome‚Äîespecially feedback on our packaging, which is a work-in-progress, and the website, etc.). And I'd also really like to invite you to a Zoom call where we taste the coffee and talk about it.

1hv5wjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hv5wjr/blind_shakers_are_like_magic_for_shot_consistency/,Blind shakers are like magic for shot consistency!,"Ever since I got my full setup, I've had such inconsistency with channeling and sprays (even when I thought I finally got really decent at WDT). At that point I had come to the conclusion that it was just going to be the case maybe with my setup/machine/etc... and I would have to live with it (unless maybe if I dialed-in my WDT so good that it would incredibly difficult to spend that same time and replicate it shot to shot).

Before I got my full setup, I was already aware of the existence of blind shakers, but I wasn't using one just yet as I was still waiting for a very specific brand blind shaker to come back in stock before I could order it; and I didn't want to settle for a lesser one as I knew that was going to ultimately be what I end up using in the end once I got it (it is basically the most expensive one but, in my opinion, the best one on the market that alleviates all the little workflow annoyances/accidents that folks mentioned having with other blind shakers - including the Weber one as well).

Anyways, continuing on my journey of experimenting and dialing-in shots while I waited (and continuing to have sprays and channeling, even with some decent tasting shots), it finally came into stock around mid-December and I had immediately ordered it and was looking forward to using it when it arrived (as an alternate/replacement for my WDT). But what came out as a result of using it I never would have imagined...

Now I knew (based on studies and evidences) that the shaker would certainly slightly improve extraction and ease puck distribution as well (compared to WDT). But after pulling like 20-30 or so shots with this thing since I got it, I am shocked to say...  

...I haven't had channeling or spraying in any of my shots even ONCE since I started using it properly (just after about the 3rd attempt or so)...

Like no joke...I actually still find it hard to believe. But I know I had changed absolutely nothing else about my setup, and have been trying several different coffees, baskets, doses, and grind sizes since then and, even the worst shot I pulled after getting the blind shaker (being a little quick/sloppy on the shaker for that shot too), absolutely NONE of them sprayed or channeled even close to as bad as they used to before (even with my best shot) when I used the WDT tool. And really, by the end when I had almost received my blind shaker, I had felt quite confident in my WDT ability by that point, so I felt any improvements in my technique further there is no way it would have made enough of a difference to make the channeling almost completely go away and consistently shot to shot as well.

That being said, I am sure I still may have been able to do more to improve my WDT tool technique. But what I can say for certain is, the amount of effort and practice required to get good at WDT appears to be SIGNIFICANTLY higher than the level of effort to get good at a blind shaker. And even if you do get good at WDT, it is a much much higher chance of inconsistency between shots (at least for risk of channeling and spraying) than it appears to be with blind shakers. In fact it's known that if you WDT really poorly you can even introduce more issues/channeling than if you hadn't done it at all.

Now to be clear, I definitely have not tried other more common/less-expensive blind shakers (as I had already determined for myself, based on earlier research, that blind-shaking would be the best for me in the end, so I might as well invest in the best one as long as the price is at least remotely acceptable). So I can't vouch for if other folks would notice the same kind of improvement on shot consistency and decreased/lack-of channeling/spraying with their setups and the blind shakers they would go with. But considering how much of a beginner I am, how much trouble I had with WDT, and how quickly I got good at using the blind shaker, I am more than certain that if anyone is having similar troubles with channeling or inconsistency between shots, it is definitely at least worth giving blind shakers a try to see if they will help you out (especially for beginners).

For reference, I am using the **SworksDesign Shaker Funnel** - https://sworksdesign.com/Shaker-Funnel-p657013013  
  
Some photos:

https://i.imgur.com/bREx0g6.jpeg (inside showing the stem/plug and inner body)  
https://i.imgur.com/aKAIDk3.jpeg (under the lid)  

A couple of tips/comments I can make about this model in particular:

1. Compared to the folks that complained about lots of grounds retention issues on other blind shakers (including the Weber one), I 'm not doing anything special and I can say for certain that I don't to be having any significant noticable retention issues on this one at all (very very little if any and it's super easy to clean off too). Maybe considering it's a much different material than other shakers.  

2. Having the silicone seals in both the lid and plug are exactly as great as I had imagined them to be. Compared to other shakers that some folks complained about occasionally giving up on them because they often had accidents if they didn't hold the lid completely tight while shaking (or accidentally push the plug up), I can say for certain these silicone seals make ALL the difference and, if you ensure they are seated all the way before shaking, it is very difficult to have an accident where grinds fall out while shaking. The little bit of extra effort to install/remove the lid is absolutely worth this piece of mind in my opinion.  

3. I found that shaking it for 10 seconds horizontally (side-to-side), rather than vertically or tumbling it all around, produces slightly better tasting shots (in my opinion at least), and it even more so decreases grounds retention (making it super minimal at that point). Here is a video referencing where I got this idea from and deciding to test it for myself on my blind shaker as well - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73uQ1vSdUZg  

4. In my case I don't use any of the fines filters that it comes with but it's still nice to have to experiment with in the future.  

5. Releasing the grounds from a very small height (about 1-2 inches) leaving a gap between the bottom of the shaker and top of the portafilter is important to allow them to fall and funnel into the portafilter properly for more even distribution (this was confirmed by Lance Hedrick as well).  

Now to be 100% clear, I am not AT ALL telling folks to go out and get a blind shaker and replace everything you're already doing for puck prep. Not at all. But I do hope all this information and sharing my own experience might at least be helpful to some to make their own decisions. If anyone has any more questions for me about how I shake, this model blind shaker in particular, or the rest of my setup, please don't hesistate to ask and I'll be happy to answer. Please feel free to share your experiences as well. It will be interesting to see if anyone else had similar improvements in their experience.

**TLDR**: Blind-shaking alleviated almost all of my shot inconsistencies and channeling issues compared to when I just used WDT. This is coming from someone who is a beginner but had already got well accustomed to their setup and done tons of research on all the fundementals of espresso-making and what benefits their tools can provide to get to where they are now.

I'm really at a loss on what to do here. My best friend Ethan (18M) and I (18F) knew each other from kindergarten - 4th grade, and reunited by coincidence in college last semester. I think we may be working toward an eventual romantic relationship, but we're both content with a slow burn, so to speak. Still, we're finding little ways to flirt and appreciate each other.

He had a difficult holiday break, so this morning I texted him not to get coffee before class because I had one waiting for him. I left it in front of his usual seat and went to go talk to our professor. When Ethan got to class, I went and sat down by him and to our surprise his coffee was gone. We both expressed our confusion.

Enter ""Ashley"" who a couple people think crushes on Ethan pretty hard. She heard us talking and fessed up that she ""accidentally threw it away"" because she thought it had been left out.

A few holes in her story... this is our first day back from holiday break, so did she think it had been sitting there for 3+ weeks? I left that point alone because I didn't want to infer that she was... not smart. But I did point out to her that the coffee was hot, and I let some frustration seep into my tone.

She replied, ""It wasn't when I grabbed it so it probably was sitting out too long and got cool.""

Minsan nasa mall ako lalo na nung Christmas and pag nakakakita ako ng something na hilig nya -- shoes, bags, etc. naiiisip ko ""sayang kung kami pa siguro mas bongga regalo ko this yr"". Sometimes I even think of him everytime may itatry akong bagong resto, coffee, etc. 

I know na hindi ko na dapat sya mamiss or panghinayangan. Its just weird that after 4 years tsaka ko sya biglang mamimiss. Could it be that I'm just giving him the benefit of the doubt na ""maganda nadin naman ang life nya now"" kaya naiiisip ko na nagbago na sya? I know I have plenty of options and time to meet someone new, I just can't help but miss him every now and then. 

Or is it because I'm just longing for a relationship? Being single for yrs is a choice. Wala nadin kasi halos matinong guys my age so napagod nalang ako makipagdate. ",2,1736187850.0,MayConfessionAko,0,1.0,False

My coffee beans are the exact same. My original pull with the stock accessories were delicious, even my husband that can‚Äôt stand coffee tried it and said it was really good. 

These ones are flat, no crema and they are so insanely bitter I can‚Äôt even drink it, I love bitter things. 

These are pulls like 3 and 6.

Since my mid thirties I began to vomit out of nowhere. Constantly nauseous and fatigued. Was always worse if I had drank alcohol. Acid reflux was persistent. I‚Äôd go to the ER when it was out of control and was always told I had gastritis. About 5 years ago I went from 194 lbs to 175 lbs so had upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. They biopsies many lesions as the Gastro Dr. suspected celiac but that was negative. I was given sucralfate and pantoprazole. 

Symptoms subsided enough to function better. 

The same thing is happening again except I recently vomited what looked like coffee grounds and then another few times was foamy mucus. 

I‚Äôve started having trouble swallowing in the last few months and my appetite has greatly increased. When I can eat I get full very fast most of the time. 

I‚Äôm nervous to see a gastro again. The endoscopy was so painful I couldn‚Äôt forget if I tried.

She works evenings and neither of us were able to take annual leave. So we decided we would celebrate her birthday on the weekend instead. We went for a walk on Saturday morning (about an hour, a little shorter than she had hoped due to the conditions) then she went for coffee with her friend in the afternoon. In the evening we got take-out from her favourite place. On the morning of her actual birthday, prior to work, I gave her the gifts she had requested. 

The week prior a friend who is in the country for a couple of months texted me about meeting up for a coffee and asked if the day of my wife's birthday suited. Knowing we were planning to celebrate on the weekend, I said it was fine. We didn't agree a time. On the morning of my wife's birthday my friend asked if 3pm would suit - I said it was fine (I have flexible working hours). She complained a little and we joked about how it was to be such a  neglected spouse. Initially she said she would walk with me to meet him but in the end when I was leaving just before 3pm she said she had work to finish and would meet me for a walk on the way back. She asked when I thought I'd be back and I guessed I'd leave around 4pm - expecting to meet my friend for around an hour.

In the end, I didn't leave until 4:45. I knew time was marching on but I didn't feel like 45 minutes was a bit deal and I didn't want to be rude to my friend. When I left, I texted my wife so she would know I was on my way if she still wanted to walk to meet me. She didn't reply. 

When I got home at about 5pm my wife was just plating dinner and had a meltdown about how late it was. She would have to leave for her work in 45 minutes. I guess she had intended to meet me based on my initial (estimate) of when I would leave and still have time to make dinner. She asked why I hadn;t agreed to meet my friend in the evening while she was out to work. Honestly I was just trying to be accomodating to my friend so I just accepted his suggestion. 

I took it on the nose and just apologised to her for being later than I had thought and offered to walk her to work instead. Still don't really think it as big a deal as she made out given we had agreed to treat Saturday as her birthday and I am pretty rarely out and certainly don't make a habit of being late.

If you're considering making the switch, here's my best advice:

1. Setup a real business. Whether it's an LLC or an S-Corp, do it sooner rather than later. Use it to setup your business bank account where invoices will be deposited to and a solo-401k for you to save for retirement (and on taxes).
2. LinkedIn is king. 80% of my business referrals came from LinkedIn in 2024. If you're ignoring LinkedIn, you're missing out on a huge pool of business opportunities. As marketers, this is even more important. People doing business with us want to see what kind of content we're putting out into the professional world. Get active on LinkedIn NOW.
3. Personal brand means a lot. This is sort of related to the above point, but I've had people work with me because they've...well...wanted to work with me. Your reputation as a solo business owner is everything. Sometimes, people just want to work with you because you're a trusted partner in the space.
4. Tap your existing connections. Getting those first few clients is going to be difficult. Instead of blasting cold outreach, tap your existing connections. They may be working at a company that needs marketing help right now. Even if it's on a short term contract, you need to get your reps in and start flexing your freelance muscles. This will create more opportunities down the road.
5. Find your core business. When you're in-house, being a generalist is great. You learn the systems deeply, what influences sales, how to contribute across several departments. When you're solo, you need to niche down. People will hire you because they have a SPECIFIC marketing problem. They need expertise now, not a jack of all trades. Find your primary and secondary marketing value props, and hammer them again and again. Offering too much at once dilutes your service.
6. Create systems, not playbooks. Systems will help keep you organized as a business owner. These can be systems to help with project management, systems to help onboard clients, etc. But playbooks are what *some* marketers use to apply to every new client they get. I can tell you right now that no two clients are the same. Each have their own unique marketing issues, and they need a partner that'll genuinely dive in deep to resolve them. Mass applying a playbook approach can make clients resent signing you.
7. Retention over sales. It's going to be hard to make much of an impact if you're always focusing on acquiring more clients. You don't have the luxury of onboarding like a new hire with 3-6 months of ""ramping up"". Clients hire you for quick impact. If you're spending your weeks selling instead of doing, you're going find yourself always chasing new business. I have a client book of 4-6 at any given time, you really don't need more than that.
8. AI is your best friend. I use AI to take notes and transcribe every client call and provide actionable next steps. I use AI as a content repurposing tool for when I'm creating my own content across LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok, etc. Getting acquainted with AI and how it can vastly speed up your productivity is paramount. Now, I'm not saying use AI to churn out cookie-cutter content, I'm saying it can be used as the perfect virtual assistant.
9. Make room for partnerships. I've referred tens of thousands of dollars worth of business, and I've had the same referred to me. That's because I have a strong community of other solo business owners. We help each other with ideas, referrals, gut checks. You need to find your community otherwise burnout will set in. Solo life can be very isolating.
10. Don't be afraid to spend. Upgrade your office with new equipment, go to that marketing conference in California, create your own networking event at a local coffee shop. I know it's cliche, but you have to spend money to make money. Create an expense budget for your business, and use it! You have to keep pouring into your own cup, otherwise growth will be very hard to come by (and the IRS will be happy to take what you don't spend).

Can you give your perspective, if you were in my shoes?","Sorry, I'm not as eloquent as I want to.. but I'll try my best.

Edit: I did not intend this to be this long! Please be patient.

Me (30F) and my BF (32M) are together for 5 years.

We were work friends before we got together, we are still workmates now. We dated for about a year before making things official. At first we're okay.. but along the way there were issues that we are, i don't know, trying hard to resolve, but it looks like we cannot resolve them no matter how much we talked about it. and now, I'm here in this position where I'm not sure if I want to continue this or not.

Here are some things I think about:

* **He does not like my family.**¬†Family is important to me. I am close with his, and he is not with mine, they are more like acquaintances for him. He gives an effort to come to our family events, gives gifts on occassions¬†*(he piggybacks on my gifts)*¬†but i'll still count that as effort. But on occassions, he does not like them. Mostly because he does not like their type of jokes. Sometimes they do make bad jokes (ex.: they joke around saying¬†*""are you sure with my daughter?"" ""ahhh you should change your partner"")*¬†as someone (me) who is with them for a long time, I get their type of jest; but he does not. I understand his perspective on feeling bad on those jokes, I tried explaining to him that they are not serious with what they are saying, it's just their way of joking and to not take things to heart. I also understand he is not the type of person to let things like that go, which is why i'm constantly saying sorry to him on behalf of my family. But this is getting tiring for me, most likely for him too.
* **He does not like my friends.**¬†I have friends which go way back uni. My friends and I hangout from time to time, and everytime we hangout, they always ask me to bring him along - he does not want to come; and it is tiring to come up with excuses for him everytime. When I asked him why he does now want to come, he just told me that he does not jive with the stuff that me and my friends like (we like going to board games, mini games and the likes); sometimes we meet up for birthday dinners , but he does not want to come also, saying he does not connect with them. It frustrates me that he is always like that; I do not bring this up to him, since when we talked about it, it looks like there won't be changing his mind. Although he does not want, one time he went with me on the wedding of my friends, but it looks like it is a one time deal as whenever I asked him to come he always goes on saying ""I already indulged you when I came to the wedding"".
   * Maybe one factor is in that friend group is my ""ex"" (is it counted if we were not official? We tried but we did not work.) however, before we got together I already explained that situation with him. Somehow he accepted it, but with reservations. So I am trying to appease him, i have already put distance with myself and that specific friend of mine. and also now, that friend is already in a relationship, and I am also friends with his partner -- all in all we are okay, except for him (bf)
   * He seldom hangs out with his own friends, but when he does, he does not ask me to come. I would have if he asked. I don't know, the overthinker in me thinks that maybe that's his way of making me back off on asking him to come and hangout with my friends.
   * He does hangout with our friends with me -- these friends being our work friends.
* **He does not want to go out.**¬†He likes spending time with his computer, even his family tells me does he does not bond with them. I personally would like to go on dates, explore cafes, foods, places. I often send him links on things I want to do together, and he just says yes, but does not follow through. Whenever I asked him to go do those things, there is always reason not to. Or he always says, oh i want to rest. Weekends are the only days I can rest. (mind you we were working from home)
   * 2 years back, I opened up to him saying that I want us to go out and do stuff together, that I envy our friends with partners who goes out. I felt bad for myself having to say that to him.. those things, I should not have been feeling it. But if I don't tell him nothing will happen. After I told him that, he asked me to go out, we did. I thought, ahhh finally - but nothing followed.
   * We do go out. On our anniversary, on valentines day... when his family goes out, and invites me. When we have planned hangout with our workfriends.
   * I also told him that, we should hangout on other days, but he still goes ""but we see each other when we go to work"" (thats once a week, and we hardly talk as we're busy with our own work - we only bond when we get dinner or coffee, but not alone)",1,1736187388.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

Hello, friends!

I've started to fall down the Peat rabbit hole, and I've even do a bit of what I suppose is ""fake Peating."" Even not fully dipping my toe in the pool I feel really good. Just avoiding PUFAs and MUFAs as much as I can alone makes me feel pretty good.

I thought I'd come here for some recommendations for Peating for someone who tends to workout in the evenings, as currently I don't live close to a gym that fits my exercise needs and don't have the space for a home gym at the moment. 

I've been doing more powerlifting/strongman stuff for awhile now, and I gotta say, the recommended diets *suck*. I never feel like I've had enough energy, and I never feel good from eating. It's most like I *have* to eat, as opposed to I want *and* have to eat.

I'm mainly a little overwhelmed about what I should eat and when I should eat it. A very general overview of my schedule is:

- Wake up
- Wash face, fix hair, shave, deodorize, etc.
- Take care of some stuff around the house
- Getting ready for work
- Work
- Head to gym
- Workout
- Head home
- Get ready for bed
- Sleep

# Current ""diet""

The ""fake peating"" I've done is as follows

## ""Breakfast"": 

I don't usualy eat breakfast, but what I consume in the morning is usually a smoothie with 

- Berry, bananas and greens (I know I know) smoothie mix from Costco with whole milk + coconut oil + stearic acid + protein powder + sometimes honey

During the week I sometimes have a couple of slices of a no PUFA bread. Sometimes on weekends I'll have some eggs cooked in tallow or ghee, maybe some no PUFA bread toast with ghee.

I'll also (usually everyday) have some coffee with lots honey and some coconut oil + stearic acid. For about the first two or three days I did this, I did end up running to the bathroom a few times, but after doing it consistently that doesn't happen anymore.

## Lunch

PuraVida Fire-Roasted Root Vegetable mix from Costco with either lamb or beef cooked in ghee or tallow (that I've enhanced with stearic acid). 

## Snacks

Usually cheese and/or cured meats, maybe some more coffee and tea with the honey and coconut oil + stearic acid mix. 

## Dinner

Usually something carb-y. I can't do a ton of protein before I leave work to go workout. It's never consistent, sometimes I've gone without having anything for dinner, although that doesn't really work for me and I feel my stomach get upset with me for not giving it anything before a workout.

## Supplements

[Elite Multivitamin from GorillaMind](https://gorillamind.com/products/elite-multivitamin?_pos=1&_psq=Elite&_ss=e&_v=1.0)

[GorillaMind's Smooth (non-stim)](https://gorillamind.com/products/gorilla-mind-smooth?variant=42945873739821)

[Disodium succitate](https://fire-in-a-bottle.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/disodium-succinate-800mg-120-capsules)

[Desiccated Bovine Thyroid](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C6FSJP5T?psc=1)

To clarify, I've had back-to-back days where I've taken not all or even none of these supplements and I've felt good. Not the most energized, but still feel good. Most of these I take to ""fill in"" some gaps.

Pre/Intra-Workout is [Nitric](https://gorillamind.com/products/gorilla-mode-nitric?variant=39431090176045) from GorillaMind

(I promise I'm not trying to simp for GorillaMind here.)

I can't do caffeinated supplements before an evening workout, otherwise I'm up all night.

# Thoughts 

Generally I'm thinking of removing the berries and greens, but I'm a bit skeptical of it. I know both have a lot of good stuff in them (phytochemicals, some vitamins, antioxidants, etc.), but I know it's not really ""Peat-y"". The smoothie to be truly ""Peat-y"" would have to be like

- Orange juice
- Bananas
- Raw eggs
- Whole milk
- Protein powder
- Coconut oil
- Stearic acid

Which I'm fine with, but I'm still a bit iffy on whether or not I'm missing out on some antioxidants. I know Peaters usually recommend tropical fruits, so maybe it's fine.

I'm a bit off put by processed sugars, because I love honey and fruits, but I know it's not discouraged by Ray Peat.

I usually buy meat in bulk and freeze it, but sometime I'll get something from the store. I've found that the 0.5-0.7 grams per pound of body weight to be **plenty** of protein for me, and pushing it to 1 gram per pound of body weight means I've stuffing my face to where I don't want to eat anymore.

I'm a tad off on when it comes to no or minimal black pepper on meats, as I do know black pepper does have some evidence of being anti-inflammatory, but I know it's not exactly ""Peat-y"".

Adding gelatin into stuff is the thing I don't really care for. Gelatin isn't a meaningful source of protein as, IIRC, it has a poor amino acid profile compared to just...eggs, milk and meat, which I already eat. I've taken collagen in the past and since getting it out of my supplement stack I don't feel or see any meaningful difference.

I have some aspirin coming (I could've just gotten it at a convenience store, but whatever) but I don't know if that's a hard requirement of Peating or not.

Yes, I will eat the carrot salad before any of you meme about it, although I'm a tad worried about consuming too much vitamin A.",1,1736187335.0,raypeat,4,1.0,False

I did not got and itch so much, so I just stopped and did not bother for months.

2 months ago I decided to go to a local casino. Free drinks ,  nice atmosphere , relaxing. I loved it. Started with 10 bucks and the bet was 0.10 . Was playing Multi Wild 90% of time. Having a coffee in the morning , some sweets and if I lose I go. Then I start going with 20 bucks . Still not big deal . Until I start reaching for my bank card and start withdrawing money. Kind of like a junky. One day I lost 80 bucks . Few weeks I go I lost 150. Then I start going everyday in last 10 days.  

Yesterday I decided to go for a last time with 30 bucks . Again  multi wild . Made them 120 in 30 minutes. Could not believe it! Was unbelievable feeling. Having 120000 points. Lost them untill 20 down, then but again high and made them 80. All took place like in 4 hours. But I did not stoped and went home with 0. At 2 AM and I am at work next day.  Swear to not play again , 20 minutes later I put 20 euro in online casino and for 10 minutes they became 140. Shock! Yes! I could stop now and finish clean and happy and not play again! But no. Went down to 60 and than stopped. 10 minutes later but 20 more . Lost them . 15 more lost them. And went to sleep with 2 hours sleep for work.
