1hnzixe,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1hnzixe/07222022/,07/22/2022 ,"Hello F, its been 2 months since you decide to walk away because you're tired of of me/ of us. And Somehow you said you also lost your identity. It's been 2 months trying to live without you. It's 2 months surviving this year. I know sa 2 months na yun most of the time annoying ako kasi I'm still trying to win you back. Pero mukhang hindi na. Last day, I tried talking to you again hoping napapayag kang mag kita ulit tayo just to have a conversion with coffee. But you said ""it's not a good idea."" I respect that and I also have feeling na hindi ka na rin talaga papayag pang makita ako. But it's okay. 

I kinda don't want 2024 to end tho, yun kasi yung taon na mahal mo ko. Meron pa akong pang hahawakan. When 2025 enters ako nalang mag isa. I know nahihirapan ka rin, alam kong nalulungkot ka rin. Alam ko deep inside ayaw mo kong ipush palayo. I know na kahit onti. Kahit onti may love ka pa rin sakin. Sa 2 months na hiwalay tayo medj madami na rin akong natutunan, madami na rin ako narealize. And totoo nga nasa huli ang pag sisisi. Di man ako nag cheat but somehow na neglect kita. And I'm so sorry for that. I also become someone na malayo dun sa pinangako kong partner sayo. To be honest you have all the rights para itaboy ako. But I hope u know na I also did my best to love you habang tayo. I also did my best para alagaan ka. I failed sa promises ko but I know that time naging genuine ako sa pag mamahal ko sayo.  Miss na miss na miss na kita. Gustuhin ko mang lumapit sayo alam kong hindi ako nakakatulong sa pagheheal mo. Sabi ko sa sarili ko noon habang tayo pa di na ako mag mamahal ulit kapag nag failed tayo. Mukhang totoo nga. Damn I'm looking for you sa iba't-ibang taong nakikita ko. I just love you that much. Kada gising ko there's a big void sa heart ko that no one can fill cause it belongs to you. Every pieces of my soul, my heart yearns for you. Yearns for your love. 
I'm so sorry for making you feel unlove, invalidated. I'm so sorry kung mas pinili kong icorrect ka muna bago kita icomfort. I'm so sorry kung I made you feel na need mong maging mature sa relationship natin because I'm not mature enough. Kung maibabalik ko lang ang oras I will do my best na mabago yun. I'm willing to give it all just to be with you once again. But I guess It's too late na

Ang hirap palang mabuhay ng hindi ka kasama. Funny di naman ako bulag or color blind pero parang naging black and white yung mundo ko.   
They keep on asking me paano ko nasabing ikaw na. Ang sagot ko lang is dahil noong nakilala kita mas natuto akong mag pray. When we are fighting and mas easier to leave. I'm praying. Kapag di ko naiintindihan about us nag dadasal ako. Dun ko nalaman na ikaw na because I'm asking to God na protect niya tayo always. Di ko idedeny na I'm hoping na bumalik ka. But I'm always praying to God na if will niya na maging tayo ulit at makasama kita habang buhay then I will be happy, di ko uulitin yung mga ginawa ko sa relationship natin. I promise to give my best and I promise to take care of you. Pero if not and ang will niya is mag grow tayo separately. I pray na siya ang mag bigay ng happiness sating dalawa. I pray na mas maging mature tayo lalo na ako. I pray na matutunan ko kung paano talaga ang mag mahal ng totoo at maayos. I also pray na sana kung dadating man ang oras na mag mamahal ka ulit. Kung hindi man sakin, I pray na aalagaan ka niya. Mas mahal at mas mamahalin ka niya ng maayos. Rerespetuhin at iingatan ka niya. (Not just physically but also emotionally and mentally.) 

Masakit man sakin ang pakawalan ka. Gagawin ko basta maging masaya ka. Please be happy. And I'm so so so sorry for every painful things I've caused to you. Alam kong mukhang malabo ang bumalik ka sakin. Alam ko rin na suntok sa buwan ang mabasa mo ito. Please know na you will always be my prayer. You will always be my favorite person. You will always be the love of my life. Nagsisisi ako sa mga nagawa ko sayo at I'm doing my best na matuto pa lalo. Salamat sa lessons mo. Salamat sa pag mamahal mo. Until we meet again. Until then I will do my best to be better not just for you but also for myself. Please be happy. I hope makuha mo yung peace na hanggang pangako ko lang sayo. I'm always rooting for you. Yung plans mo, yung dreams mo alam ko makukuha mo siya. Medj mahihirapan ka but please don't give up okay? And if maybe someday you change your mind sa mga bagay na gusto mo, please know na nandito ako 100% na susuporta at sumusuporta sayo. 

Mahal na mahal na mahal kita. Pinili at pipiliin pa rin kita palagi at araw-araw and I hope someday I will see you in the middle of everything. Sa pag patak ng Alas dose ng Jan. 1 mahal kita pero ako nalang mag isa. Patawad sa pag bitaw, F. Patatawarin ko na rin ang sarili ko. I susurender ko na lahat kay Lord kung tayo pa rin ba talaga hanggang dulo. See you around, mahal ko. Mahal na mahal na mahal na mahal kita. ",1,1735366177.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

1hnziha,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hnziha/i_have_three_guys_who_do_i_pick/,"I have three guys, who do I pick?","First, I don’t want to actually expose people(including myself) so im going to give each person a new name in this story. None of these names are real. For reference, the names I will be using are “Steve”, “Larry”, and “James”. (They seem basic enough). 

Alright. So I guess it’s best to describe my relationship with each guy im describing, so I’ll start with myself. I don’t want to out myself, but im a female teen from the ages of 16-19. I’m looking for a long term relationship, but not one that is extremely clingy which I know is probably a lot to ask for. Thats really all I can think of for now. 



Steve

Alright. Steve worked at a store in a shopping plaza I visited (and still do, which is sort of an issue) a lot, due to its proximity to my home. I literally can walk there in like ten minutes to meet up with friends. The store he works in is one of my favorite stores in the entire place!! I used to work at one of the stores in the place that was nearby, and would enter his store to get drinks on my break every day I worked. Naturally, since our schedules matched, he would check me out everyday at the register. So we grew familiar with each others faces. Eventually, one night I visit just for fun. When I leave, he runs out and asks me how old I am. I stutter through awkwardly and tell him my age and proceed to ask his. He told me he was a two years older which I acknowledged was a bit weird and we probably wouldn’t work. Then we parted ways and he seemed a bit sad because he totally was going to ask for my number. Anyways. My friend who was with me(we’ll call her Irene) convinced me to let her go back to the store and ask him if I could get his number. When she came back out, lo and behold, he happily agreed and said he had been into me for a couple weeks. Me and Steve end up talking for a while and eventually we date. We go on an ice cream and movie theater date. However, a couple weeks later his father dies. He runs to my arms for comfort which I happily provide. Later, im invited to the funeral (and whatever the after parties are called, the ones with food and stuff?). I know it’s shitty, and maybe bad of me, but I was immediately nervous because as a completely white female, his entire lineage was black, and I felt so out of place with them all. Not only that but I had never met a single one of them. The first person who approached me was his sister, who pulled me aside and asked me my intentions with her brother, and threatened to come beat me up if I broke his heart(this is a grown woman with children and a husband…) then I met his friend group and blah blah blah. After this day, I noticed he got really clingy and a bit pushy. He started looking at old comment I had made YEARS AGO on like a thirst trap of some random dude millions of miles away, sending me screenshots and demanding reasoning because apparently “they look nothing like me!”. Then he would push to hang out every single day and ultimately I started getting really tired. My friend Irene would lecture me and beg me to break up with him, and eventually I did. But the issue was me and him ended up getting back together several times, each time for the span of like a week. Because deep down, before his dad died, he treated me so kindly. And he is an incredible guy. And I definitely like him I just…I don’t know how much and i feel like if we got back together history would repeat. Not to mention, the last time we got together, my ex best friend from like eighth grade visited him and spread a bunch of rumors about me, which he didn’t tell me until he told all of his coworkers. I was pissed and cut off contact. Now, present day, he’s texting me asking for forgiveness and a second chance. To be honest I’ve entertained it and that’s on me. I said maybe, and now he texts and snaps me often. I feel terrible. I don’t know what to do. 


Larry
Alright. So Larry began late October. He was this really cute guy, so my type. Nerdy, 6’0 and not really popular. Skinny, middle part. I stalked him down and found his Snapchat in sept. and we started talking in October. We rushed into a relationship. He was the first person I’ve kissed and gotten physical with. He was incredible. The issue was he was just under two years younger than me. He didn’t have a job and he never learned how to drive. He also acted incredibly immature and makes extremely inappropriate jokes about sa and race. Ultimately I brushed it off because I thought maybe his bad behaviors would stop, because he treated me great! But no…he would try to get physical with me in front of my friends and his friends which was incredibly awkward. A couple of my friends pointed it out. Not only this, but you know how you and your best friend would jokingly flirt? Well me and my best friend Irene would always do that. He HATED it. Glared at her, was rude, everything. He never took me on dates and only wanted to stay home and cuddle on the couch and watch tv. I’ve since broke up with him. It’s been a couple weeks. Now, he texts me at midnight saying he misses me and I can’t lie that I miss him too. But he wants us to have a second chance I don’t know if I should let that happen. 



James
James is different. He’s a year older than me, and he’s in my physics class. I’ve had my eye on him for a little because I figure skate at my local rink, AND, he hockey skates there as a worker at the rink for public skate. It’s perfect. He knows some of my friends. He’s cute, extremely kind, we joke around, skate together, but he’s SO dry on text. So dry. But he tries, I think. We play gamepigeopn sometimes. And he even said he would love to get coffee with me when I asked. I said specifically “would you like to get coffee tg or something when you come back from your trip?” And im not sure if that’s too friendly or if it insinuated that I asked him out. Whatever. I’m not sure if I should even persue James. Because what if I like him but I get close to him and he’s a totally different person! So far, we share so many interests like shows and music etc but idk. 





Conclusion:

I concluded that I should stay single for a while, but the run down is that all these guys wanna know if they have a chance(at least two do) and im gonna have to man up and choose one of them. 


So Reddit, who should I choose and why? (In the long run of course, im not looking to jump right into a relationship fresh off an old one.)",1,1735366127.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1hnz4z8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ButterfliesAI/comments/1hnz4z8/my_thoughts_on_butterflies_after_6_months_of_use/,My thoughts on Butterflies after 6 months of use,"I first used Butterflies since an article about it published by Techcrunch on June 18 this year. So that means I've been using for almost 6 months now, though I'm kind of disappointed I didn't discover it earlier, while some users on Discord said they were already using it during Christmas last year.

That aside, 6 months of use, and I found 6 most annoying things about Butterflies's autoposts (posts that the system generated automatically). Here they are:

1. Butterflies love yoga. On the other hand, I hate the constant yoga poses my Butterflies do in their posts.

2. Butterflies love meditation too. Just like yoga, this is so invasive that when you created a new character, it often has the default ""practices meditation/yoga daily"" in the personality. Even worse that after removing that from personality, Butterflies still frequently make my characters do yoga/meditation/some spiritual bullcrap out of nowhere.

3. Butterflies love their candles. This is so effing ridiculous when you see them lying down on bed with lit up candles placed on the sheets! Do they want to get roasted or something?

4. Butterflies love their mirrors (even if they don't use them in the posts). They often pose in front of mirrors while the presence of mirrors has nothing to do with the context of their posts. Even worse, their reflection in the mirrors are often wrong. This is being talked a lot on Discord to the point it became a meme of some sort (just like the Alex meme not to long ago).

5. Butterflies love their city view. It seems like almost every time a character sharing photo of themselves in a room or house or office, there's a good chance the background shows a city view, as if all Butterflies are living in a skyscraper. That by itself is not really a problem but after a while, you'll notice it's overused, and even the comments by other bots often reflect this, with their cynical (and often negative) remarks like ""nice city view but where's the fireworks"" or ""city view looks better than you"".

6. Butterflies love their coffee. I really love coffee, I consume it every day without fail. However, Butterflies seem to default to coffee every effing time like other beverages like tea or maybe soda don't exist. It even shows in comments like ""coffee-fueled activism"" or ""coffee won't help with your ugliness"". Please tone this down.

So, that's more or less my ""report"" on Butterflies after using it for around half a year. While I do notice some improvements, I have to say more things (like the autostories, hate comments, and the beep-boop censor that threw me back to the first step of character creation) are getting worse, and the 6 points above that are stagnant and never fixed. I hope for next year the developers prioritize on fixing existing annoyances and bugs more instead of adding features and gimmicks.

On a past account, I frequented this subreddit often. It was my lifeline for a solid two years. I have gastritis from nsaids and coffee. It also came with many ulcers. I went down a pretty dark tunnel for awhile. I had to grieve the life I previously had. I had to endure the initial shame and discomfort of not being able to dine out (or in) with coworkers and loved ones. Surviving the ignorant questions and comments is a battle of its own. This is hard, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.   

It took a lot of facing myself in the mirror about what I was willing to give up to make myself happier. I didn't want to give up smoking, but I had to. I didn't want to give up edibles, but I had to. I didn't want to stop eating fried food or sweets, but I had to.  

Two solid years of home cooked, bland foods. Only seasoning I dealt with was salt. Only water. After awhile, I could also have Powerade. I didn't even try anything else.   

I slowly introduced bland sweets (shortbread cookies, pecan candies) at year three. Didn't attempt red meat again until year four.  

It's not perfect. If I strain my upper body too much, I'll still flare. Something overtly spicy like buffalo sauce or very acidic like sauerkraut is an absolute no-go. I haven't tried alcohol again, but I can have edibles. But too much still has a poor outcome. Other than that, I can eat everything I could before getting gastritis. Burgers, fried chicken, salad with any address I want, soda, tacos, etc.

But it does get better. Stick to your resolve. Also, slippery elm would've sped up my healing exponentially and I regret not trying it sooner.

1hnyspk,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1hnyspk/baby_suddenly_hates_crib/,Baby suddenly hates crib?!,"My almost 9 month old is a great sleeper and has been sleeping through the night for about 6 months. He was only interested in contact naps for the first 2-3 months, but those were rare. The majority of his naps and all of his nighttime sleep have been in his bassinet or crib. We moved him to the crib in his own room maybe 3 months ago? I had more trouble transitioning than he did. He’s been a champ.

About two months ago, he started daycare, and naps at daycare have been hit or miss. Still, no huge sleep disruptions.

Recently, though, he has started to get pretty upset when he’s placed into his crib. No change in routines at home - we’ve had a solid bedtime routine for a while now and he never seemed to really need or want a naptime routine aside from fresh diaper, sleep sack, and the white noise turned on.

Tonight, he woke up screaming and was inconsolable as long as he was in the crib. Picked up and not looking at the crib? Calmed right now. Feet hovering over the crib? Screaming.

Google was oh-so-helpful and said it could be about 14 different things. Has anyone experienced and/or overcome this? Anything you can recommend to make him not hate his crib all of a sudden? Is this the 9 month sleep regression? Should I go buy stronger coffee and better concealer now?!! Thank you in advance for insight and advice!",2,1735363474.0,NewParents,3,1.0,False

I didn't romance him at all and spent most of ME1 and 2 feeling like either he had nothing to say but exposition dumping on his background (which is fine, but I feel like you have 2 conversations with him in 1 and then never speak to him again if you don't romance him). By the time I hit ME3 with the Mars mission, where he spends a healthy chunk of the beginning repetitively questioning Shepherd's authority in the middle of a mission. Like, yes dude, I get it; you don't trust Cerberus, but Anderson and Hackett clearly trust Shepherd enough to let her out of alliance prison. Do you have no faith in your commanders? This closeness felt kind of unearned, same with the hospital scene later where Shepherd talks to unconscious Kaidan. I feel like between 1 and 2 I've barely spoken to this man at all and now Shepherd is practicaly mourning at his bedside and the most I felt about him was annoyance.

Then I hit the Citadel DLC, and it's amazing. First let me say the writing for literally everyone in this DLC is on point; it's part Mission Impossible, part slice-of-life comedy, and one of the peak experiences of ME3. However, I think the character best served by it is Kaidan. My Shepherd went into this DLC with a romantic interest, so when it came time to do the little hangout interaction with Kaidan, it was just a chill little get-together. His banter with Shepherd while he cooked was great, and later at the party, his endearingly tipsy responses to Shepherd asking if he can help with guests are funny. Even the next morning, when everyone is hungover as hell and Kaidan is hyped up on coffee, is small but fun. I left the DLC being like, Damn, where have these interactions with Kaidan been?"" Why have I never just had the option to be friends with this guy?

I'm assuming there's some better dialogue with him locked behind his romance route, but I think Bioware really screwed Kaidan over by not having more casual dialogue for him in ME 1 and by not having him be a part of the squad at all for ME2, where universally everyone was getting better writing. Which Kaidan could have especially benefitted from, as he isn't as outwardly interesting as our alien companions (not to devalue having a human companion option, but in a sci-fi game about aliens, I feel like most people are drawn to talk more to the aliens). Either way, I feel like I missed out on a great potential friendship because of how Bioware structured/ wrote his dialogue.

1hnypuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hnypuu/im_shitfaced_after_suffering_through_a_holiday/,"I'm shitfaced after suffering through a holiday Boomer party my parents were invited to, so here is the story of the time I came face-to-ass with the full grown bull gator at work after it escaped containment. ","To start, this was in the double digits of years ago, and when the local animal authorities got involved some time after this story, I openly gave witness to everything relevant that I observed. I managed to use this sonova bitch story as a conversation starter after a bottle of wine in at this party.  
  
In short I volunteered at a reptile sanctuary back  in the day. I'm gonna be vague so I don't stir any shit that is too much of a hassle for me to flush yeah? Last I heard of the place, the relevant people are no longer there. Back then it was under staffed, under funded, and before it moved, was in a downtown core-rot building.  I never handled any of the hots (venomous snakes) or anything that could maim me without it being a freak accident, and stuck to tending to the smaller animals. Did you know there is an entire family of turtles called cooters? Yeah, I giggled all day. 

Anyways one day I let myself in, and the place is empty as the boss and the other volunteers were busy doing an event elsewhere ( Like a booth at a festival or a rescue or a party, I wanna stay vague) and I go into the kitchen to see what boss had managed to scrounge for food ( opened bags of dogfood from pet stores for the feeder rats, stale discarded produce for the herbivores, ect) before going upstairs and tending to the small mammals, which needed cleaning. 

  
I notice, poking out from under the table, the hind end of a fully grown bull gator. I wince, as due to the poor conditions of the place, animals were known to up and cark it from time to time, and regardless of condition, things die after a long enough time. We're talking a good 10-12 footer, and they must have had to leave for their event before figuring out what to do with a carcass that big. As sad I was, I was moreso curious, so I walk into the kitchen, less than a yard away.

That's when I learn it was, in fact, not dead. 

  
Thankfully this isn't a story about me surviving a gator attack. This bad boy was polite, and used it's reptilian brain communication skills to curtly tell me to fuck. off.  I learned that day gators can indeed hiss at you, cause it hissed at me. I thanked it for being considerate and using it's words to tell me to fuck off, and I fucked off. Slowly backwards. I then closed the door. Then placed some furniture in front of the door. Then I drew a horrible cartoon stick figure gator and taped it to the door. Then I phoned boss. 

It seems the wall of the gator's room, the building originally not being built to deal with tropical animal heat and humidity, plus both escaped and wild mice and rats, outright rotted in part of the wall, just big enough for the bugger to slip through. I go about my other chores in a different part of the building, occasionally checking to make sure the door stays shut. 

  
Our smartass of a boss at the time came back with the other volunteers, and being the brilliant mind that he was, was all "" Don't tell anyone or they'll shut us down. Now whip out your phones so you can record me wrangling this thing!"" and he did, indeed, wrangle it back into it's enclosure. 

I sadly do not have footage.  I just needed to tell this story to the world, because I can, and as I recover from red wine and Spanish coffee, realize it's a doozy of an experience. ",2,1735363182.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.75,False

She was hospitalized, while there she was fine but a little out of it.

I feel awful about this but I couldn’t take care of her and it was apparent that she can not live by herself, so she has been living in an assisted living facility. 

I went to visit her on Christmas Eve, and for the first time she didn’t know who I was. She pulled me into a hug but when the nurse asked her who I was she wasn’t sure. She didn’t know my name or anything. She was completely out of it, she was tired, she kept nodding off, couldn’t make any sense.

She was her mom’s caretaker for 20 years. Last year her mom passed away, she was totally fine last year, not mentally impaired, nothing out of the ordinary. I know it’s dementia but it’s crazy to me how quickly it’s progressed in her. A few months ago we were going out to coffee and playing scrabble, and now she can’t walk without falling, and has no clue what’s going on.

I have developed a crush on but I am unsure  if he is just nice or flirting. Ahhhhhhhh 

I have had a situation similar (everyone thought he liked me (even my teachers in High school lol), he was touchy, always complemented me , wanted to be alone and he was a very shy guy, so anyways, we went out for coffee which I thought was a date, turns out … it wasn’t … I told him I liked him and he said he didn’t like me in that way etc…) 

Now back to the present… lol 

This guy (different one) is super nice to everyone just his personality but sometimes I feel like it’s a bit more (my friend I go to uni with said don’t read into it because he is nice , and sometimes he will pat her on the back too). 
However, it’s been more, always wanting to hang out.  I am just stupid sometimes maybe to think , just maybe he might like me . Idk wtf is wrong with me lol. 

he will ask me personal questions where everyone else don’t (guys). 

I asked him if he was dating anyone , he said no , it’s been 8 years when he was in high school. 
His girlfriend broke up with him due to him being an  asshole back then. 

So I said I am sorry to hear that, he said he has been working on himself for the last 8 years , and a people pleaser kind of nice to make sure he doesn’t hurt anyone and to include everyone , so he is nice to everyone. 

But then…. My stupid brain and heart think it’s more when he …. 

Then he will brush together or when I passed my phone, he will brush my fingers. And smile . 
Again not sure if it’s by accident or . 

I feel like I am reading into more. But ever time I see him he makes me think it’s something more 

He is very cute too . 

Also, when we were in the lecture theatre (rows of seats) , a couple friends and I sat together. 

But at break the girls moved because we were sitting to close to the screen and it was hurting their necks. 

Anyways, 
But then I said to the gig  if it’s hurting your neck and you want to sit with them by all means go ahead. He said no I am fine sitting here , I said you’re sure Because it’s only us lol. I laughed out loud he said yes. T
hen he said it’s comfy here.  

Cause he could have moved because he was clearly uncomfortable sitting in that chair with his neck. But he choose to sit with me . So nice or just didn’t want to leave me alone . I guess. 

This week I am on winter break (or Christmas break), and he has been texting me lots , always him first never me. 
Just saying Wyd or heyy how are you? Etc. like everyday. 

Which is very not like him.

**Background**

**cropscropscrops** is an Ohio-born, Montreal-based rapper and producer, currently making himself known in the abstract & underground scenes through collaborations with names such as **Pink Navel** (Ruby Yacht) and **steel tipped dove** (fused arrow records, known for his production and engineering work for **Armand Hammer**, **Fatboi Sharif**, **Alaska** of **Atoms Family**, & **ShrapKnel**, among many other names); putting together and releasing three full-lengths albums in the 2024 calendar, he has proven to be as prolific as is he hard to pin down. Enter **Vaygrnt**, a New York-based producer with an equally abstract and undefined production style, releasing his own instrumental project [*Sailsongs*](https://vaygrnt.bandcamp.com/album/sailsongs) to cap off an excellent creative year following his collaboration with crops – the short, yet mighty project released this past January, known simply as *From Here, Out There*.

**Review**

*From Here, Out There* is an album by two artists I'd never heard of, which I stumbled across the day it released by pure chance, scrolling deep into the stygian depths of a thread on r/makinghiphop. Intrigued by the description, I clicked the bandcamp link; and to say that I was not expecting to find not only my album of the year, but in my opinion, one of *the* defining projects of abstract hip-hop released in the first half of this decade, would be a massive understatement. I had to spend my first few weeks with the album really trying to confirm that I was sure about what I was hearing; and safe to say, my friends, I’m definitely sure. Despite being incredibly brief at only 18 minutes and change, I found myself continuously enthralled in the world built around me by the vivid lyrics and placid tone of one **cropscropscrops**; spoken almost entirely in metaphor, the way these songs conjure imagery in the mind is almost as potent of that of classic 80's text-based adventure games, or perhaps a particularly good novel. Take the opener “arancini from a street vendor”, a two-verse slow burner that ends as cryptically as it does poetically: “my future son’s enigmatic pulls out milk from the fridge / you gonna wake up or keep sleeping it really is what is it is / but if i plot my path there’s some bones i gotta dig / this fragile dinner plate i bought for a couple of bones from a kid”. There's usually no profundity in the banality of something like taking milk out of the fridge, but the way that lyrics like these are expressed across the album makes them hypnotic to me. It's deadpan, quiet, defeated in timbre; but over the crashing snares, glitching electronics and mournful keyboard provided by one **Vaygrnt**, it leaves you reeling as the track falls off a cliff into the outro just as quickly as it began.

Speaking of, I'll talk about the production on this album before I get into more specific tracks, because it's uniformly incredible. When I usually listen to rapper / producer collaborative projects (even my favourite ones, such as *Piñata*, *PRhyme*, *Below The Heavens*), I'm left with the feeling that while, yes, they may share double-billing on the album and both put in roughly 50% of the work, it's usually up to the rapper to bring the *emotional* weight to a record, to steer it in a particular direction once the producer has laid the groundwork, and pull the beats together into songs that form a cohesive tracklist. I don't feel that way about *From Here, Out There*, and part of me wonders if that's half the appeal. When I hear the soundscapes of tracks like “towards the sun” or “my phones recommended photos”, I can equally imagine Vaygrnt pouring sweat and soul into his productions as I can any rapper poring over their notepad, desperate to articulate an internal feeling that manifests itself as anything *but* words in the mind. Even a relatively simple beat like “coffee stain” after the opener is eye-widening in how starkly *dour* it is. When I listen to this track, short as it is at 74 seconds, I can almost see the blue colour fading off the album artwork; the sky instantly shifting to grey, each rubbery synth hit landing like a raindrop on the concrete. The lyrics are equally aimless; “where you goin after this, can I follow? / where you goin after this, can I follow?' feels almost like a plea not to be left alone in the downpour. And with a thumping 808 machine-gunning away in the background, there's still a head-nodding grove to it that keeps me coming back.

But I have to dedicate a paragraph to just the third track, “towards the sun”, solely on the merit of how phenomenal it is. Considering it follows “coffee stain”, the most despondent rap song that I've heard this side of *Some Rap Songs*, it almost gives me whiplash with how fast this beat swirls into a triumphant upwards spiral. I can perfectly envision the synth line cracking the clouds open and bursting the sunlight back through, the rays of light shimmering and sparkling just like the beautiful keyboard embellishments here do. “towards the sun, that's consoling / I got sunk costs from cause and effect / cause all these days end up rolling down that same path. I stay blasé with it” are the first words vocalized above monotone on this album, crops upping his vigour and liveliness to finalize the blinding effect this song has on the senses. It's really a moment I'm struggling to describe, but know it's one of my favourite musical moments of this decade so far, and that's with the excellent glitched-out rest of the verse notwithstanding. We get one more repeat of this serotonin overload at the outro of the song, and just like that it's gone before the 2:30 mark – if you want to hear it again, you gotta run it back.

If it wasn't enough to hit us with a perfect song this early in the tracklist (remember, track 3 starts not even four minutes after you've pressed play on *FHOT*), we get another perfect one directly after it. “my phones recommended photos” begins with a beautiful vocal loop before the peppiest drums on the album so far start to pepper the track like bullets. I think this song is actually the best example of something I've noticed about Vaygrnt's production, and that's how one-of-a-kind his drums usually sound – I don't know if they're sampled, spliced, warped, ran through tape machines or what, but there's always an extremely specific and wholly unique tambre to his percussion I’ve never heard anywhere else. And speaking of unique; “a foxhole, my big ticket item” is just one of the many distinctive phrases that stick with me from this song. I mean, I totally agree, but I doubt I’d ever put that exact thought together, with those exact words, in that exact order. It's extremely **R.A.P. Ferreira** coded, but missing completely the tongue-in-cheek wit or mild-superiority complex flavour usually found across Rory's own work. I couldn't even begin to tell you what “the email chain / astigmatism rain” is supposed to mean, but it's a turn of phrase I've had stuck in my head since January, so I'm sure it has to be something. And I haven't even mentioned the best part yet; when we reach the end of the verse, the first beat slowly fades away (mimicking the final words crops says on the track) to make room for an instrumental outro that is simply to *die for.* This minute-long beat switch right at the end is easily Vaygrnt's strongest showing so far; an incredible and frankly intimidating muscle-flex behind the boards that truly shows what this young producer is capable of, and why your favourite abstract rap producer should be nervously glancing over Vaygrnt's shoulder right now, trying to copy his homework. Serving double duty as a centrepiece to the album (we're already halfway towards the end) I consistently find myself involuntarily turning the volume up to dangerous levels at this part, as the drums continue to rain down like hail, the colossal sound circling and enveloping you completely. There's no point even trying to follow this moment up – the following track “taking a line for a walk” is a much quieter number, entirely drumless for the first minute, the croaky raps from crops barely registering over the static haze and and bare atmosphere. There's some tasteful autotone drenching the final lines of this song, which really bring to life the dejected wailing it closes on; “and I see land ahead... and I'll circle around again”.

The album contines to be a tonal rollercoaster, whilst still staying impressively sonically cohesive. “-2.5 / +2.5” uses an effective repeating mantra to hypnotize the listener - “under water, under construction, under surveillance, under the microscope, under review”, while “takeout” performs similar duty to “towards the sun”. Lifting the energy with much brighter production, a nice *In Rainbows* reference, and more strangely captivating mild frustrations: “the water bottle stuck in the vending machine, I shake it / but I can never get the god damn thing to fall”. I've never rooted more for a main protagonist dealing with this level of first-world problems; but given that the vending machine, like almost every other line on this album, is likely a metaphor, your interpretive imagination really is the limit with *From Here, Out There*. Our despondent hero exits this depressive world with the much more traditional-sounding “2 truths & a lie”; a plodding, but no less exciting beat leaves room for crop's most verbose and lyrical song on the album, full of dense rhymes that leave much less space between the lines (at least compared to the very cautious and withheld delivery we’ve grown accustomed to across the length of this record up to this point). It's harder to tell if the story on this track is more literal or figurative; “once in the west of France I was slipping out of some guy's van door / slept on the mattress in place of his back seat” could be an entirely real, or just another imaginative twist on the unremarkable. Either way, it leaves us looking at the future as we leave this realm, as opposed to stuck beneath the cold water we see on this album’s beautiful cover photo. “my philosophy is that back fence gon’ get knocked down in the next storm, so you might as well go over” - well say less, mate. I'll see you on the other side.

5 weeks after the release of this album crops & Vaygrnt saw fit to release a deluxe version of *FHOT*, bolstering the runtime from 18 to 27 minutes in the form of four more bonus tracks. While *FHOT* is a bulletproof release in it's own right, and I don't always feel obliged to listen to material tacked unceremoniously onto the end of albums, these cuts are just as great as the main album and I undoubtedly recommend them. My favourite might be “hands”, a joyous, buoyant cut composed of a beautiful looped choir vocal and wonderfully lyrical imagery; “I feed the mustang with my palm flat / a bit more grass has it moving spectacular.” Or it might be “blubird” the solitary instrumental cut, or the fantastic guitar-backed “out of the woods” with a verse from longtime friend & collaborator **Static Res**, the album’s lone guest feature.

Now extended to album-length, it became even easier for me to crown *From Here, Out There* as my favourite release of 2024. I've returned to it more than any other project in a year full of serious heavy hitters, diving into it headfirst like how I'd try to get lost in an ambient album; always knowing that when I come back, that climax on “towards the sun” is always going to scratch my brain just as well as it has all year, the outro on “my phones recommended photos” going to swallow me in a whirlwind of ecstatic noise, all of the abstract quotables I've barely scratched the meaning of going to sit unsettlingly with me for even longer. Vaygrnt has seriously outdone some of the biggest producers in the underground this year, on both this and his [solo project](https://vaygrnt.bandcamp.com/album/sailsongs), while crops has kept the momentum going with not one, but two more projects this [June](https://cropscropscrops.bandcamp.com/album/conversation-at-the-gas-station-about-where-to-go-next) and [September](https://cropscropscrops.bandcamp.com/album/long-light-derecho), produced in full by **stale brick** and backwoodz mainstay **steel tipped dove** respectively. Both of those albums are as short, sweet, and worthy of your time and attention as this, but I think the first one – January's *From Here, Out There* – came out of the gate swinging the hardest, with the best production, the most captivating performances, and the tightest flow across a tracklist of all three. These two are names to be watching next year, and with plans for a second collaboration for 2025 well in the works, there is no better time to tap in to the new biggest talents in the underground than right now, and no reason to believe it will be of any less quality. Thank you so much for reading.

**Favourite Lyrics**

**Talking Points**

* Abstract independent rap music has metamorphosised in various ways over the last 20 years, from Def Jux, to Rhymesayers, to Hellfyre Club, and most recently we find backwoodz studios waving the flag for the subgenre. With it clearly inspiring music as good as this, do you think we will see more artists emerging in this vein than we have before, or will it continue to be a relatively closed-off club?
* have you ever found a decent album through reddit? Do you usually keep your ear to ground for smaller artists, or is there simply too much noise to cut through?
* Why the hell do almost half of these songs still have less than 1,000 Spotify streams? ):<
* Vaygrnt, if you're reading this, I'm sure I got all the descriptions of your instruments wrong - it's only because I couldn't produce my way out of a wet paper bag. Sorry mate.

I’ve already graduated college and I live with my partner in the next town over from my college town. I still have plenty of friends in school because I’m young… I have a 9-5 job and I’m really struggling with balancing that with my sleep and my life. I’m a woman, and my body prefers 9-10 hours of sleep to feel well rested.

My issue is I’m young, I’m supposed to be getting drunk and having fun with my friends and living my life and how the hell do I do that when my body requires 10 hours of sleep to feel functional?? I used to drink energy drinks when I was in school, but after 3 years they made me feel sick. I don’t like coffee, but I’ll drink a chai latte from time to time, but buying chai lattes daily for energy is expensive. My friends invite me to go out and when I do, things end around 12-1am, and then I have a 30 min drive home, so when we drink I spend the last hour or so sobering up to drive. But then I’m supposed to be up by 7am for work… when I go out it will throw my body off and it takes 2-3 days for me to recover. This makes me not want to go out with my friends, even though I have a great time, the consequence doesn’t feel worth it. So I’ve quit going out with them and I just feel like my life is slipping away and I’m so young yet I’ve already given up all of fun of being in your early 20’s all because my body needs 10 hours of sleep. It is starting to bother me a lot, I feel anti social and overall very left out of life and I can’t figure out how to balance it all. Is there anyone else who’s young, but requires a lot of sleep, and has work at 8am, and can go out and have fun??  How do you do it?

1hnyhdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1hnyhdg/weird_day_weird_night/,"Weird day, weird night","Yesterday was very weird.

TL;DR: Broke off with my ex, hung out again last night, ended up being physical with her even though we established we aren't together anymore. Later at night, a drunk ex-Bumble match from 3 years ago texted. Told me how much she missed us(we went on a few dates long back) and ended up bombing me with texts about what she wanted us to do. Even bombed me with her nudes because I was cold replying to her.
It was a weird, mixed-up night, and I’m not sure what it all means.



My ex and I broke off a few months back because there were a few differences in expectations and commitments. It was a very weird breakup (idk if I can even call it that) because we were (maybe are) very close, on such good terms and the kind of couple who even after arguments, used to understand each other very well and clear things out.

Anyways, post that, we were trying to distance ourselves. We even agreed that meeting new people might be a good idea so that we can take our minds off each other, move on, etc. But since it has been only a couple of months (after a 2.5 year+ relationship), neither of us had the headspace nor the heart to talk to anyone else in that context.
But of course, given that we had broken off, we had established that we'll not be physical anymore. So both of us were having a pretty dry patch. There were occasional ""I miss you"" texts but we established clear boundaries and didn't meet.

Cut to yesterday, Friday night, she said she wanted to meet. I asked her if it was a good idea, and she just hushed me and said let's go out. We went to Churchgate, Bandra, roamed around. Tried doing it as friends, just held hands at max. Ate, laughed, really cherished every moment. It was very fun, I had missed this.
She then told me to come for coffee at her place (she lives in Wadala). It was slightly late so I didn't want her to travel alone anyways, so I accompanied. We reached her apartment, sat for a bit, one thing led to another and let's just say we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We went all out, we were deprived of each other for so long, we didn't hesitate one bit.

Before doing this I did ask her what this meant and she said it didn't have to mean anything, we were still just friends and even though she wants us to be together, since we cannot work this out, let's not complicate things. I left at around 11.30 from her place and reached home. All good, all fun.

This is where things got weirder.

I opened Insta and had a text from an ex-Bumble match, now chill friend from 2021. We used to text on insta sometimes, here and there just random reels since she worked at a copywriting firm, so I used to send her impressive ads and she did the same. Nothing more for the past couple of years.

The text was from 2 hrs ago. So I just replied, and she came online.
It was weird, since she generally doesn't stay up post 1, and it was already 1.30am.
She then told me she was drunk. And then she went to vanish mode.
I was surprised, I asked her what's up.
And then she did not hold back. 

(For context, late 2021 we had met on Bumble, met a few times and did quite a few things. I wasn't looking for anything serious at that time. She wanted to date, but I was anyways in college in a different city so it didn't make sense to me.)

She said she wanted me to come over to cuddle and make out. I obviously said no, since I just came back home and also the fact that I literally made out with someone and came back.
But she kept going, she said she missed the times that we used to have(very out of the blue, we hadn't been involved for almost 3 years now).
She then started sexting, telling me all tbe things she wanted me to do to her. And what she craved, what she missed. I obviously kept saying that you're drunk, you should sleep. But she didn't stop.
She kept saying how much she needed me rn and craved me(I don't want to go into details but I hope you can imagine). And she explicitly kept saying my name, so idk if it was general horniness or what.
30 mins she kept going, describing everything in detail. I didn't respond too well, idk if I was even doing the right thing listening to her but since I was technically broken up, I didn't outright stop her.
She even said that don't you miss me and miss her, and when I said that ""xyz, I was in a relationship for the past 2 years"" she said ""fuck her, I want you to fuck me"" and she started sending me her nudes😭

I told her to stop and sleep, she obliged after sometime.

I was so confused. It was so weird.

idk what was up with this day.
idk if it has anything related to the time of the year, the weather, the breakup szn or what.

so yeah, weird (wouldn't say not fun though XD). but yes, weird.

just wanted to get this off my chest XD.",2,1735362333.0,OffMyChestIndia,2,0.75,False

I’ve always felt like I was an old soul, someone who was drawn to the quieter, deeper side of life. As I’ve gotten older the less things or people I’m around the happier I seem to be. The only downside of that is I miss simple connections. 

I crave deep connections/conversations that not many people can even handle, which is fair sometimes but others times I wonder what our skill sets would be if we didn’t have the ability to communicate through social media or messaging apps. Would it be better? Would we learn more about people? 


Don’t get me wrong I am one definitely that has failed to do so in the past talking to new people but when I do find someone I click with I want to find out ALL about them. What was it like growing up, hardest lesson(s) they’ve ever had to go through, I want to know more than just “what do you do for fun” ? 

FYI, my pet peeve is that question. Which leads me into you learning a little about me:

Reasoning behind that pet peeve as a question is that it what I do for fun can be ever changing. It can change from the friends I’m with, to the seasons. It’s such a loaded question that can be broken down into many, many more questions but we don’t take the time to do so. 

So now that you know a pet peeve here are a few other things that may or may not interest you. 

I love the outdoors, eventually one day I will live in the mountains and hopefully drank my coffee on the porch every morning as the sun rises. I enjoy hiking and camping and I live in a state that has pretty decent trails. I’d rather cook then to ever eat out again even though I’ve had some amazing food. I dream of owning a farm, growing my food and living simple. I haven’t made the best decisions in the past but I’m learning each and every day. 

Hopefully this message finds you well and if I’ve made an impression I’d love to learn more about you! If not, I hope this post finds you well. ",2,1735362309.0,R4R30Plus,1,0.75,False

In 2019, the last intel model. I am a video editor, so my use case is very taxing, I was trying to use while I was visiting family for the holidays and it just started shutting itself down after 5 mins of use, I’m ready to give up on it, but I also just don’t make the money to justify a new maxed out MacBook that will get only used once every few weeks when I’m on a trip, or if I want to work in a coffee shop. I’m thinking about getting the cheapest MacBook I can find that will work, and I’d be able to edit on, not wanting the best experience, just for it to handle editing simultaneous 1080p proxies and not completely shut down. I also do freelance videography work and want to be able to do stuff on the fly in those environments. But again, I would not use it that much.

So my question is: what should I go with? a new m4 MacBook Air? An older m2 or even M1 MacBook pro? I really can’t afford to spend more than $1k on this thing. And while I could sell the old MacBook, frankly that thing is in such bad condition at this point, it doesn’t have much value, and it has a little bit of sentimental value (it was the first MacBook I bought with my own money)",1,1735362152.0,mac,2,1.0,False

1hnye7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hnye7q/spilled_coffee_ruined_carpet/,Spilled Coffee Ruined Carpet,"My brother visits every summer around July 4th, and every winter for Christmas. He stays… a while. A minimum of 2 weeks. This was never really discussed - it just kind of became assumed when he moved out to the West Coast.

One thing I’ve always felt when he comes and visits is that he treats my house like a good guest would for the first few days, then seems to settle in and starts setting his own house rules and disregarding mine.

One such example is that I’ve always asked him please don’t bring coffees from Dunkin’ upstairs into the guest room because it’s a cream colored rug and a coffee spill would be bad. Like clockwork, even though I’ve asked him many, many times not to, it inevitably turns into a power struggle where he just blows me off and brings the coffees upstairs.

Often I will welcome him to come with me to the gym, and when he cracks open the door I can see there are like 10 unfinished coffees all over the floor.

Last year (one year ago), I was getting the guest room ready for the holidays and discovered a MASSIVE coffee stain that had been concealed under a box. Clearly there was effort put into removing it.

During a convo with my mother I mentioned it and she essentially pre-emptively went nuclear and then eventually hung up the phone, just because I mentioned being upset about the stain.

Christmas 2023 came - I never even bothered mentioning it to my brother because I didn’t want to ruin Christmas over it.

Well yesterday it all came to a head - my brother and I got in an argument about other tensions similar to this one that have accumulated over a period of many years. 

It came out during this argument that my mom knew about the stain last year, but concealed it. Then it all made sense why she tried to pre-empt the conversation last year by making me the villain for being upset. 

From there, once these facts came out, neither my mom or my brother were willing to apologize or make amends and instead doubled down and called me a “crybaby” (with my brother making crybaby motions to denigrate me), a loser, and petty, and he also would literally stick his fingers in his ears and go “la la la la la I’m not listening to you” (yes literally - he’s 33 btw) and neither of them were willing to engage with everything that led up to the spill or the subsequent “coverup”.

The argument just kept escalating with absolutely zero ground given on their end.

This has been a long time coming but this is just one such example of this type of behavior.

I’ve decided it’s time to take a break from these people, and as difficult as that is to do, I think it’s necessary.

1hnyd9n,https://i.redd.it/gm3e0r94ui9e1.jpeg,Do motion graphics cost more than traditional ads?,"""Are Motion Graphics Expensive or Just Dressed Fancy?""

Let’s talk about the elephant in the advertising room: cost. When someone says, “We’re thinking of motion graphics for our ad,” there’s always that one person in the meeting who gasps like they just heard the budget was stolen by pirates. But are motion graphics really more expensive than traditional ads? Let’s break it down with a little humor—and some logic.


---

""Traditional Ads: The Coupons of Creativity""
Sure, traditional ads are the old-school way of getting the job done. A couple of actors, a nice set, maybe a cute dog—bam! You’ve got yourself a commercial. But here’s the thing: those actors need coffee breaks, the dog needs treats, and the set needs lighting that costs more than your rent. So, is it really cheap? Or are we just pretending?


---

""Motion Graphics: Picasso with Pixels""
Now, motion graphics, on the other hand, can feel intimidating. It’s like looking at a painting and thinking, “How much is THAT gonna cost?” But remember, with motion graphics, you’re not hiring actors, renting locations, or begging the weather to behave. You’re investing in creativity that’s fully under your control. And guess what? No one needs a union break!


---

""The Hidden Costs of a ‘Cheap’ Ad""
Let’s not forget the fine print. That “budget-friendly” traditional ad often comes with surprise costs: reshoots, delays, and, oh yeah, the editor who says, “We need another week.” Motion graphics? Once the concept is locked in, it’s like a well-oiled machine. No weather delays, no diva demands. Just smooth sailing to your vision.


---

""ROI: Return on Imagination""
Here’s where motion graphics really shine: they’re an investment, not just an expense. A killer animation grabs attention, sparks conversations, and stays in people’s minds long after the ad ends. Traditional ads might cost less upfront, but can they match the engagement of a dynamic 3D animation or a snappy kinetic typography sequence? Doubtful.


---

""Are Motion Graphics More Expensive? Depends on Who’s Asking!""
If you’re the kind of person who sees value in storytelling, creativity, and standing out in a crowded market, then no, motion graphics aren’t “expensive”—they’re worth it. But if you’re comparing it to the cost of sticking a guy in a chicken suit and calling it a day… well, maybe it’s not for you.


---

""Your Ad Budget’s Glow-Up""
At the end of the day, motion graphics are like buying a tailored suit instead of grabbing something off the clearance rack. Sure, it might cost a bit more upfront, but the fit? The impact? The compliments? Priceless.

So, do motion graphics cost more than traditional ads? Sometimes. But the better question is: Can you afford to stick with tradition when your competition is moving at the speed of animation?

Allan said Janas dad stirred his coffee with a sting cheese which Allan called animalistic. Allan said “it was one of the moments, I want to slam the table and say this is unacceptable”. Then her dad talked with his mouth full of cheese and coffee. **Now I know where Jana gets her issues from** 

“My dad can’t just sit in silence. I have a really hard time with people who just want to fill silence with small talk” **UMMMM YOU CANNOT BE ALONE FOR A SECOND, YOU ARE THE SAAAAAME**

Jana loves about her moms side of the family they ask her nothing about work. **Because they can’t stand you, it’s why half of them didn’t come to your wedding** Her dad asks about her childhood friends, Jana claimed her dad is stuck in a time-warp of when he left the house. “Feel like he is trying to make up for lost time. Dad take a breath. He has to feel settled that he doesn’t have to speak 24/7.” Allan defended him, Allans said he saw he almost had to step in. Her dad would say Scotland in a Scottish accent and even his new wife had to tall him to stop.  

Jana about her dad “HE ISNT’ VERY AWARE AT TIMES”💀 Allan said he wants to please you. Jana “we are ok, I won’t write about you in my next book.” 

**The level of frustration and anger Jana had during this segment of the podcast revealed a lot!! She is no where near healed from her daddy issues.  The way she spoke of her dad and the anger she had while describing how she would snap at him was IDENTICAL to the way she treats Mike but honestly it sounded worse (shocking, I know).  I can only imagine how rude she is to her dad all the while staying in his home.  Why didn’t you stay at your mom’s then? Or at an Airbnb?  She is so critical of her dad but doesn’t see their parallels.  Both are cheaters. Neither of them can sit still in silence.  How many times have we seen Jana camping out in front of Allan’s office while he is working?  Jana used to popup at the gym when Ian would go, allegedly.  Both have 3 or more marriages under their belts.**

Jana said that while in Michigan for Thanksgiving, they had dinner for anniversary of meeting.  Yes like we said they first met and banged for three days straight.



**CO-PARENTING**

Guest. When 50/50 means the dads are in it to win it. Society communicates dads don’t matter. Studies show dads are just as important as moms. Jana responded “mhmm”

Allan asked the guest “so when you went to 50/50 did he stop paying maintenance?” 

Guest says she listened to Mikes episode. Jana paying Mike always creates tension. She found it not struggling they are struggling with it. 

Jana said him paying his share of the kids would be great. “Clearly my ex needs the support to house kids in a house. Yes, that’s where the anger is too. I paid you alimony on top of this.” Jana said she never sees the day coming where Mike won’t need the child support. Allan agrees, he said in the UK he’s never heard a woman pays a man. **False, there are cases of women paying men support in the UK.  This no good loser needs to STFU because I doubt he wants everyone to know about his financial standing overseas.  Allan is the one that had to sell his house to pay off debts from the car accident so last thing he should do is judge Mike’s financial situation. Again, Jana and Allan are forgetting Mike worked along side Jana.  What do they expect him to get nothing when she was/is the primary bread winner? Nope! Maybe next time think twice before getting pregnant.** Jana claims Mike only took in the marriage money wise and would blame her for not having a job.  

Jana spiraled asking why she would give Mike 50/50 when she asked “what did you do at dad’s last night, the kids reply video games” Jana said it felt like a dagger and she gets upset. She clearly wants to control what goes on in Mike’s house and she even admitted that in this episode. The guest said Jana’s feelings are normal but the kids have a basic human right to be parented by both parents. **Jana is furious they play video games by Mike.  Whooopdeedoo! The kids are there one freaking night during the week and every other weekend.  It isn’t going to melt their brains.  You constantly say to Mike “you can’t tell me what to do in my house”, then why the f*ck do you think you can tell Mike what to do in his house?!??!?!**

Jana also admit the kids now ask “when is daddy day” and continued “but i want my babies” **This, this right here is why Jana has suddenly become bitter.  By taking 70% I bet she hoped the kids wouldn’t like Mike because they wouldn’t see him often.  Jana didn’t count on the fact that Mike is kind and Mike is their emotional safe place and person.  The peace, love, and warmth they experience at Mike’s will never happen at Jana’s.  I mean look at how Allan has admittedly said he treats Jace.  Look at the comment above about wanting to slam his hand on the table when Jana’s dad ate cheese with his mouth open.  Jana and Allan are toxic and the kids are beginning to see it too**

Allan “our situations are different. I pay my ex money.” **Lies.  How does he pay his ex-wife when he isn’t employed?!?** “When we split she has had him more because I traveled a lot. I was not around, even 70/30 wouldn’t work. I’ve never been in a place where I can try to have 50/50 not even close to it. Which is why no one likes to pay money but I’ve done it for years”  “Yeah she gets money but she is taking the responsibility, like 80 %, even more now. She’s alway had him.” “There’s been struggles to pay money and no one likes to pay money” **DING DING DING!!! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.  Dumb and dumber are struggling financially.  Allan was the most vocal he has ever been about Mike receiving child support.  He has clearly become a parakeet and is copying everything Jana is saying. What I love most is that Allan LITERALLY just admitted he is a shit dad and NEVER even had 70% custody?  Claiming it’s because of his job?!?! Bro you weren’t Christian Ronaldo, there is an off season which is when you could have been with your son.  But nooooo I bet your last girlfriend was top priority even over your kids, kinda like they are now with Jana.  It is soooo funny to me that both Jana and Allan put their significant others over all of their children.**

1hny8qd,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hny8qd/i_met_with_my_ex_today/,I met with my ex today. ,"I met with my ex today. It wasn't a chance meeting or happenstance, passing on the grocery store or in a cafe. I had emailed him, asked him for coffee. Due to some (a lot of) recent happenings and circumstances, I thought it would be good for me to get some closure on how things ended. It's probably for the best in the long run, but it feels pretty shitty as of right now.

Some background:

He and I had known each other since middle school, though highschool, and through college. I had had a crush on him for the vast, vast majority of those years. Then, when we were both in our early twenties, we got together. I moved in with him after about two years, the first time i had ever lived away from my parents, and I honestly felt like I had won the lottery. The guy--the man-- I had pined away for far the better part of a decade was finally my *boyfriend*. Maybe that was my first mistake.

I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. I thought I was going to grow old with him. Hell, I *looked forward* to growing old with him. He felt like home. 

I'd say our breakup wasn't typical. The best way I know how to describe it is him ghosting me when we lived together. He started finding every reason to be out of the apartment. Barely talked to or looked at me. After about 3 days to a week of that, I finally just told him I was moving out. But it hurt, and I think it messed me up more than I realized at the time. Obviously. This was 5 years ago, and I'm still licking the wounds inflicted by the person I thought would be my life partner. 

I've dated other people since living with him. Even moved in with a guy for a bit. And I did love them, but I was never *in love* with them. I looked at them and all I could do was, in some way, compare them to him. Part of me is afraid I'll never be *in love* again.

I told all of this to him today. He had the decency to look ashamed, at least. I find out he's dating his HS best friend's sister, someone who I once asked if he had any feelings towards. He said he didn't remember that conversation. I believe him, and I don't blame him for dating someone new. It just hurts. Apparently he started therapy not long after our breakup, and does regular monthly check ins with her (been together 2 1/2 years) about how their relationship is. And I'm not upset that he's dating, I guess it more hurts that it's someone I always knew was on his radar, even before he knew it himself. All I can think is ""why can he be better for her in ways that he wasn't for me?"" Although I know it's not true, obviously, but I can't help but feel a  little jealous or resentful of her, like she's living the life I always thought I'd have. 

Towards the end of our meeting today, I asked him point-blank, ""Did you ever love me as much as I loved you?"" He tried to beat around the bush, but after some prodding, he finally admitted that no, he didn't think so.

I knew that. I always knew that. And it both was a relief and a heartbreak to hear him admit it.

So, I don't know. There's no one I can really tell this to who will have an unbiased view of things. I guess I just needed someone to rant to. I don't  think this is the end of relationships or anything, but right now it sure as hell feels like it.",1,1735361537.0,offmychest,1,0.67,False
1hny8e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1hny8e4/brother_planning_sisters_bridal_shower_feeling/,Brother planning Sister's Bridal Shower - Feeling overwhelmed,"My [29M] Sister [32F] asked my Mom and I to throw her a bridal shower, and initially, we were excited. But when my Mom and I realized we know nothing about party planning, we all agreed that we would contribute to the wedding another way and my Sister would plan her own shower instead. This seemed fine until yesterday when my Sister called, upset, saying she had picked a date (two weeks from now) and was angry that we weren’t planning or showing more enthusiasm.

She thinks it’s a simple task and just wants us to put effort into it, but the truth is, neither of us are naturally good at this. My sister is very particular and has a specific vision, so I know she’ll likely be disappointed with anything we come up with. She wants a bakery-themed shower with brunch foods like bagels, pastries, and coffee. The guest list is small (11 people, all family save for one friend), but the pressure still feels overwhelming.

My mom isn’t the traditional homemaker type, she’s not into cooking, hosting, or decorating. If it were up to her, she’d probably use paper plates and grab a banner from the dollar store, which my sister wouldn’t like. I really don’t want to let her down, but this isn’t something I’m naturally good at either. She seems upset that we’re not more excited, but our family isn’t super traditional when it comes to these things. I feel bad that she has such high expectations because I know we’ll never meet them.

If anyone has advice on how to navigate this situation, or tips for planning a simple, bakery-themed shower that won’t break the bank, I’d be incredibly grateful. I just want to make her happy without feeling like I’m drowning in stress.",1,1735361504.0,weddingplanning,10,1.0,False

i'm writing this to whoever wants to read this recollection of my most recently ended and longest relationship; sad, illogical, profound in how unbelievable our misfortune was, a testament to how no one can really help another without helping themselves first, one for the ages, and one which I apologize for littered with poor haphazard repetition; more verbal vomiting, a nauseated heart a soul whose toes have been stepped on one too many times. More like stomped on the pain shooting thoughts through my brain, cycling on an endless track with reckless abandon rather than a properly formatted piece of writing. It is not meant demonize her not do i wish to wanna pile on myself either so there you go.

  It just is what it is as terrible nonfunctioning relationships tend to be. So where else to start but with the most clear and obvious red flag that should send anyone in the opposite direction. 

My ex partner is an abusive drunk. She gets so drunk she often forgets where she's at. That may not really seem like a big deal as we all do that at times when we're three sheets to the wind, but when she does it she often becomes lost and despondent to the point she won't respond to a person in front of her asking her if she's OK, her eyes glazed over like someone who just witnessed a wild animal make a meal out of someone they know, cognitive function receding back to a nonresponsive state, crying out for her dad over and over in desperation,  unable to communicate with me or any person that offers assistance. Lost and scared in her own body. 

Once she forced me to walk down Hwy 1 chasing her as she refused to acknowledge anything but a need to talk to dad and I mean refused, totally non-communicative head shaking eyes wandering where am I type plea hiding behind bushes, trees and retainer walls, me trying to coax her out of the shadows. That was after a perfectly fine night, a great night on vacation before she tried to make out with a random woman in a bathroom which sent her into one of those downward spirals i came to know so well.

On occasion she would start hitting when rage replaced that confusion spitting, and kicking and falling over, a tirade of  expletives, just being launched at the only target available, yours truly. This would happen seasonally, monthly, even weekly when things weren't going well. Then once she was corralled, safe, calmed she would demand on having sex to pretend things were going swimmingly a band aid of normal for the bleeding out of crazy only to start crying uncontrollably, but insist we keep having sex like no no it's OK, don't be bothered by me uncontrollably crying keep fucking me, which would inevitably lead to consoling her then her asking if her kids are okay, where they are, did they get their meds, where's her dad, a glass pyramid of panic shattering with a touch. But that wouldn't stop her, she'd insist we to continue to have sex, transitioning to talking shit about other women we knew, comparing her sexual abilities in graphic ways in the worst of ways while i was left numbed, stunned, remembering everything before passing out and poof!  

The next morning nothing was remembered, it was all to be dismissed as some sort of bad dream rationalizing she behaved in an acceptable fashion because i said things were going to be okay when her most coherent thought was that she wasn't that bad. And so on she went with no understanding of the impact on me or how much the whole episode, episodes would diminish our relationship my feelings for her my well-being, everything about us. Here let me carry all your trauma for you while in your mind it didn't happen at all.  

So no surprise there were no apologies no idea the damage done. And all of that could be in one night at times, a medley of those behaviors being routine, whether it be on a trip she would plan as a getaway, or my birthday, once while l while dressed up as Jesus, I have a Halloween birthday, and yes, I got hit dressed as Jesus on my birthday because she's an abusive drunk not because I did something wrong other than enjoy my birthday. 

But it wasn't just my birthday it would be after one of my family members birthdays her slurring away, embarrassing herself at my elderly parents birthday, or, me being a musician, virtually every time i was performing; the more pats on my back, the more special i felt without it being explicitly to do with her the more of a guarantee it was i would be facing a full assault. 

To be clear there were times when it wasn't that extreme, we had plenty of good times though free springing to mind now, though they specifically seem to be when she had my undivided attention on any planned trip where she had me all to herself but as my waltz down Hwy 1 after closing time taught me, cars zipping by nearly hitting me, that wasn't a guarantee either. 

getting crazy enough yet? just getting warmed up here. 

perhaps I should've known better, despite deeply, loving her and her deeply loving me at the start she would do things like brag about spite fucking someone who dated one of my exes, as if this was something to be proud of or something i would want to hear. Or one of my personal favorites, how her ex husband and his second wife, a prostitute with a professional career who thought being a prostitute was being a 'strong liberal woman', would try to have threesomes with her even though they also wrote letters to her parents claiming she was an unfit mother and should not have custody of their kids. And not to belay the point ex husband and prostitute wife were just plain ugly. Physically offensive to look at their demeanor like ordering a Steak au Poivre and getting a grey boiled slab of dog food instead. 

 Who in the right mind would share that with their partner? that’s not something you talk with somebody about, certainly not confiding in your lover, your ostensible soulmate, but these are the kind of things she would brag to me about, her pride in how spiteful and petty she could sink to. 

At some point her ex husband announced cancer had returned, terminal this time. Not long after my partner told  me she was pregnant, the only time i have ever had a chance to have a child. And she asked me what i wanted. The answer seemed somewhat obvious. The blunt and apparent truth staring me in the face was an impossible argument. How could this woman have our child when she was about to have sole responsibility for three kids already challenged by their shit father? pile more on my partner when she was already piled on by everyone else? it didnt seem fair, it didnt seem right. what i wanted? secondary at best. so that was that my decision was made. maybe it wasn't that simple. maybe it was. Then covid became a thing.

 Had she carried our child she would have given birth at the height of the pandemic. Me having a family seemed to run contrary to the will of the world. To top it off the woman i thought i would marry ten years prior killed herself, drinking herself to death at 40, 2, 3 bottles of wine a day for a decade while calling me shitfaced telling me how much she missed me. i demanded she stop, i wanted to move on with my current love and six months later she was dead, i had no child and the pandemic was in full swing, my current partner navigating the shitstorm of her idiot husband, their kids. She did so with aplomb, i admired her so much for the level of effort. 

Through that god awful year my partner had taken it upon herself to do everything not just for her three kids, but for prostitute wifes two kids as well; all the schooling all the taking care of, everything. She was constantly put upon by her ex to teach not just hers but the other two who somewhat unsurprisingly had major major developmental issues; not able to do any homework not able to brush teeth not able to wipe their own asses, literally having medical issues due to having asses shut by dried shit. But their actual mom was busy being a 'professional' the exhusband being in his constant drug fueled hippie bullshit lifestyle sharing his wife with paying customers. 

At my facetious suggestion, my wonderfully sardonic sense of humor, i had the idea of a death party for him, and she loved it. Spite after all, if i havent written the word enough, was the central theme of my partner's interactions with her ex.  So she and the prostitute wife rolled about at a hastily put together death party with all of his old friends his two wives being all of each other to show how great they were. So fucking sad and small. Yet I just kept looking the other way because she over and over professed her love for her soulmate, little ole me, the one in the background listening, caring, supporting, always available for any amount of emotional highs and lows, ready to share the burden and dismiss my own needs. 

What happens next you  ask? Well what else but more drama? Said prostitute wife filed for divorce going so far as waging an online and local campaign to ruin cancer husbands life claiming he was abusive to her and the kids even sending a letter to his landlord, detailing a laundry list of allegations having him kicked out. Terminally ill, incapable of taking care of kids, preoccupied with going to concerts and what does my partner do?

Finds him a place to live so her kids have some semblance of what these people considered normal and after destroying an already dilapidated house and nowhere to go, publicly shamed by prostitute wife, he should have gone home to pennsylvania and died in shame which is what he deserved. but no. 

My partner bought a new house and moved him into the ADU, a secondary unit on the property. At this point she claims she didn't want me to move in but hey everyday i was needed for anything she needed, at her beckoned call, her herculean effort to protect her kids simultaneously repudiating cancer ex husbands history of deriding her accusing her of being a risk totally unfit mother, every second with me the only reprieve the only outlet for enjoying herself for catching her breath, for feeling loved and appreciated. Cancer husband didnt care didn't say thank you ever. His family never thanked her or me ever.

 They'd come visit and we would hide in our bedroom, her crying to me how she hated all of it hated them all and just wanted to be away with me somewhere, anywhere getting drunk and smoking, pretending this wasn't her life and her choices but always always wanting me there all the time to share the consequences. but then blaming me for being there at the same time in those drunken broke moments. so many of those moments. but no i was supposed to just take it and act normal. be loving. be kind. 

While she always had her kids in her heart, helping her Cancer husband was always about the spite, the pettiness and i would hear it. It was about showing his family how much better she was than them, how much better than he was and his prostitute wife who had tried to take her kids away. That was what it was all about. 

So she completely disregarded our relationship declaring over and over her love for me the only person in her life actively helping her but the spite for her ex husband and his fucked up family more important than having a child with me, more important than us, more important than me.  All to show how much better she was than him to her parents to his parents and anybody who was paying attention. spite for spites sake; moved him in under the guise it was for the kids when with me, it was very clear it was about showing how well she was doing how much better she was than them.  Who would have guessed this wasn't going to work out so well? 

Of course after he died she broke down telling me all the abuse she suffered in their marriage, how he would pour drinks over her head and scream and threaten to hit her and god knows what else, the exact things she dismissed prostitute wife for claiming and backed him in pretending wasn't accurate, that he was somehow worthy of even seeing his kids at all and just leaving me with nothing to do but carry the trauma that she created; an unholy mess for herself and her children to be mired in, never mind me who was forced to help pick up after him, literally, he was a complete slob who taught their kids to be complete slobs, clean up after his dog, and generally tolerate him and be as nice as I could be to a cancerous drug addict who physically abused my partner but her focus was more on how i was a problem in her life. How i wasn't doing enough for her. How somehow for some mysterious reason i wasn't loving her and committed in a way she felt was sincere. Huh.

 Then her daughters problems came to the forefront. 

Her early teen daughter started cutting herself and ruminating about suicide after moving in her dad. Incapable of going to even a single day of school without totally freaking out should've been obvious there was a problem deeper than what was being said her dad dismissing the behavior as a self centered brats attempt to one up her parents.

 The daughter would call me disgusting with disdain everytime she walked down the stairs but her mother would dismiss it as some trivial thing even though it was devastating to me. Absolutely devastating I cannot stress more how hurtful it was. Was this perhaps too obvious a distress signal? Hmm not my business i was just there to support not to actively parent that was for her and dad. 

Of course it was a call for help as her father was the disgusting one; he was in fact molesting her in the house right under her mother's nose. My partner had moved her abusive ex-husband and coddled him after his second wife kicked him out for the same abuse she endured, and he molested his own daughter, all in between partying and going to shows with his buds cause when you have terminal cancer, you get to do whatever you want apparently. And where was my partners focus? Again and again her attention was how i was the problem in the household all while I was asked to standby and just support her and all her decision-making that led to all of this. 

Her daughter remembered little gems like being put in the closet when she was young with her siblings at her dads old house so he and prostitute wife could host men coming over, friends of his, paying John's, but all the while he was at the house with us, the one i wasn't needed at, my partner would say how bad a parent i would be and refrained me from any advice or guidance, relegating me to menial duties for the house and family as neither of them taught their kids, even the most basics of cleaning up after themselves or doing any basic chore. disgusting her daughter would call me and instead of taking the warning signs seriously, my ex was far more interested with making sure i couldn't talk to any woman without being convinced i was doing something wrong, something nefarious because that was the real problem she could control. That was the problem she chose to focus on that was the real problem in her mind without any appreciation or consideration or any sense of self-awareness of the gravity of the endless trauma dumping I endured every day. every waking moment it felt like. 

When i would leave the house for any reason, visiting parents, grocery store, rehearsal, certainly going to get a beer by myself or with a friend i was routinely, casually told not to bring diseases back, to watch myself, that i have a dirty dick. again i never cheated in any way, never went out looking for it, and passed on any person who came on to me. In fact i gave up all friends, women and men, to appease her obsessive control when we started dating.

 That was my decision though, and I had a rowdy drug fueled group of professional friends, an ex from years prior who still occasionally called drunkenly, that is before she killed herself, literally drinking herself to death at 40 right as the pandemic got going months after the cancer diagnosis and the possibility of fatherhood was snuffed out. I was ready to move on from a lot of my friends not to mention female friends in committed relationships who would use me as an emotional ballast for all the things there commitment couldn't be, a theme throughout my life still eerily mirroring the current predicament i was in even if i was the one sleeping with her every night, vacationing, fucking. 

And how many relationships or friendships did I ask her or expect her to give up? Zero really just the opposite as she wanted to spite caretake for her child abusing ex-husband, but I digress.

i didn't work for the majority of the relationship, quitting my service industry job right before the pandemic started and lacked the gumption to assert myself after due to that control and the fear of constant constant demeaning commentary. when i did find work she unsurprisingly made the same derisive  comments questioning the attractiveness of the whole one female co worker, what did she look like? did i have the opportunity to fuck her? don't bring diseases back. 

To show how happy she was after a week in the job she made a big show of a public fight trying to kick me out in front of her ex husband and his friends, the same friends i shit you not that would participate in sleeping with him and his prostitute wife while kids were locked in the closet. and she wondered why i was paralyzed unable to work regularly, unable to find upward mobility. 

I'm an artist, musician and i was unable to even play music at home, to draw, to write,  unable to do anything really, just the things she asked me to do like drive her kids around and do things for her, anything to make the schedule in her life easier a little easier but certainly nothing with any joy or sense of fulfillment and what was my reward you ask? Me giving her an endless number of orgasms, going out out for drinks or those trips, her paying or her family where she would get so drunk, her professing her undying love for me, waiting, watching as she would go into her off the cliff, crazy shit at any moment my seemingly boundless empathy and honed sexual abilities there to save the day. She knew it, she depended on it.  Sadly, annoyingly, I am an artist and artist are full of shit. We're a flighty bunch, with our heads in the cloud, and my creative soul my whole being was just pulverized beaten down by this repetitive lifestyle, i was being systematically broken apart.

it wasn't just a behavior for out and about though.  To be sure when we did see any of my long lost friends she would profess how we're soulmates and that she loved me more than anyone ever in the history of everything. But i'd get the treatment at home, around her ex husband, around her kids who would witness her routinely, not just being a terrible person to me when sober, but in the middle of the night when we come home, her shitfaced, screaming nonsense, crying to them, apologizing to me, apologizing, then screaming more then wanting sex, then apologizing and screaming more; rinse and repeat. this was normal for me. 

What was supposed to be months had turned into years. Finally he died, thankfully. 

Afterward I had the 'i was abused by him just like his prostitute wife claimed' bombs dropped, nothing quite like graveyard trauma dumping. Of course at that point my partner and i were still unaware of the molesting, her daughter doing her best to pretend it wasnt real her social problems magnified, the help her mom did her best to get not revealing that truth. So on we went. 

Day after day her daughter hid in her room emerging to call me disgusting and destroy the kitchen.  On and on, show after show i performed afraid, waiting for my partners drunken monstrosity to bellow and ruin me. Look the other way, use that practiced look of 'yeah im good' with bandmates and acquaintances but just waiting for the hammer to drop after every show, after every time i did something for myself. 

A big show came up, a new venue, a place where all my old friends not talked to not kept up with for years were going to be there. So many old faces i hadn't seen for so so long. My partner proclaimed how we were going to show them how in love we were, how we were so good together. We were going to show them she said.  Sound familiar? a touch of spite perhaps? 

Off she goes with her daughter to buy an expensive dress have an expensive lunch and not make it back til right before showtime skipping dinner but that pricey salad and drink for lunch should be more than enough sustenance, right? 

Away i play saying hi to this person and that ' so great to see you' and 'thanks so much for coming, missed you' ' let's stay in touch and so on'. ooh almost forgot i had nerve damage in one arm that was indeed painful, something that could only get worse as i play, soldier on i did and when you perform at my age you don't get mind splitting trashed; bad form bad professionalism. where oh where could my partner be in her five hundred dollar dress? where else? Staggering about buying drinks for anyone without one, some random woman clinging to her, clearly by the randos hands being all too friendly, the smile and look, one i knew, one who met my partner in the bathroom. No doubt in my mind. my partner rambling barely able to speak but to buy more drinks and tell old friends how great we are, new friends how great she is. Then comes the turn. 

i'm exhausted, my arm in pain i'm ready to leave and so as we walk away she starts in; just evil as shit babbling spewing about what i wasn't doing. i just want to get the car, as with literally every show i drive her drunk ass home, it never a possibility she would or could ever be sober enough. 

Worse and worse screaming spitting falling until oh wait where's her purse? my fault of course. away she goes back to the club, getting a ride back from a car of all my oldies. i'm sitting in tears as they pull up waving as she spills out, then off to party and you know enjoy themselves. Mean while i get to be screamed at, hit, blamed for how much money she's spent on me that day and everyday and made to feel as bad as i can. i'm certainly over the limit so when she got out of the car mid drive home walking away in the middle of the street i was done. done before that but done done. nothing left. no love for this torturous monster. Somehow i get her back in the car when all i wanted was to run. If i had no gear in the car i would have just left the car right there idling in the intersection. But no. 

 We get home and all the things; her waking her kids, screaming crying begging for forgiveness demanding sex talking about others crying for dad and on and on until passing out. 

It's over, i'm ready to leave, ready to never talk again so what happens? the next day she drops her kids at school but daughter flips out and needs immediate retrieval and on the way back BAM!! major car accident her car totaled by some dipshit smoking a vape. 

Crying in a total panic she needs me, of course. I wanted to ask why? why should i care i have nothing left but how could i hang up and walk away? of course i pick her up do whatever she wants she needs. Oh and her son has brain surgery coming up in three weeks. For real. 

This is my life with her.

Followed up days later by a shameful drunken dinner with kids and daddy who flew in to buy her a new car, the server apologized to me for them, her and and her dad's heads rolling about as the kids sat there awkwardly smiling. Ever had a service industry person apologize for the utter shit they are witnessing? it's another line in the sand. another end of all things. no love can pass it. 

Weeks later a family vacation without me to celebrate successful brain surgery and oh that's right her daughter revealing she was molested. And i'm suppose to care. to have some level of value, of commitment. Nothing of me left. but this is me so how's it get worse?

i shit you not in the same 24 hour period of that dead daddy the molester revelation a bandmate calls saying  our bandmate, her husband had been arrested for... child molestation. videos of him and children found. you can't make this shit up. the same woman i have to hear my partner talk shit about while we have sex for the last year at least. her husband. Fuck my life and all these people. 

i having nothing to give to my partner it's all gone. I console my band mate and its just a flood of my repressed emotions. does it have to do with my band mate?   Nope. Is there anything but pain to share? nope.  desperate to share in all the hopeless put upon mountain of shit forced down my throat? yep. i needed a connection, someone and my band mate was that person someone else with an unanswerable experience. someone that may be able to relate. 

Nothing ever happened between me and her, never even came close to being a thing, i wasn't leaping at someone to get me out. i needed someone who could empathize, to remotely conceive of how broken and filthy humans can be. A couple months later came my birthday and as was the case, my partner did what she always did. Finally we broke up. finally it was over. 

she, my ex,  blames me though for us breaking up because as she puts it she'll never forgive me for that friendship with that band mate, the only female friend i'd had in six years because of this relationship and one that was obligatory and in the end some form of solace for total total insanity. 

Somewhat obviously that was the problem that my ex focused on scrutinized demonized blind to her own destruction of me, all the things i endured for her, the fact that every woman and not just y band mate whom i came into contact with she would question skeptically whether or not i was having sex with making horribly demeaning comments to keep me hating myself not just in the last few months but the whole relationship, blaming me beating me down for something i never did - be unfaithful in any way. 

 she was even jealous and vindictive about how much her cats loved me jealous that I cared for them in such an open way literally asking me why I didn't love her in the same way with a nasty jealous tone completely oblivious to how much her own uncontrollable actions diminished my love; limited it.  killed it off. again, she would go on and on about how she loved me more than anybody in her entire life and then I was her soulmate, but this is how she would treat me. This is how she regarded me all the while her ex-husband while alive having carte blanche in the household until he died, his legacy of abuse something to share. 

 She was jealous of her cats for fucks sake's. I couldn't even love her cats without being shit on and called disgusting by her and her daughter. and yet she couldn't grasp, why I grew distant why I couldn't express explicit love for her. just more layers of insane shit right? An avalanche under which I was buried and she'd never even notice. 

 So so many red flags right? What do you do when there's so many red flags you don't know where to start? where to end? Maybe i'm a bull, red flags irresistible to charge at. if you're wondering about zodiacs, Scorpio, duh, with this tale of hyper emotional violence and drama. But this wasn't diminishing the relationship or my capacity to love her, or her me no of course not how could that possibly be the case?

She wanted complete control and I had given it to her over and over so willing to hide in the chaos of it all. so unwilling to fight for myself. no fight or flight rather neutral energy. playing dead a man who wasn't there. 

When i moved out she boxed all of my things including gifts i gave to her children, toys and comics for her special need son an air fryer for her daughter surprise she didn't pack up the golf clubs I got for her older son or the coffee table or chair that I brought from my family's house, but there were also benign things like a ladder or fruit picker i had gotten, anything she could think of that reminded her of me as she stormed around, blaming me because obviously i was the villain, i was the problem, packaging a photo in the box of her so unhappy at one of my shows, me sad that she was unhappy because except for her it was a great night, her petty spiteful final fuck u to me, my stuff conveniently ready to be removed while all her ex husbands pile of junk that i helped move in just sits there untouched, something she can't deal with. won't deal with. Seems kinda obvious right? But she and her daughter didn't seem to mind being around their abuser's shit, that wasn't important enough to get rid of. Me no problem, physically abusing child molester belongings, not so much.  

she never did change her name after divorcing him so as far as i know she and the prostitute wife still have his surname. two terrible wives to a terrible POS i never needed to know in any way but to support this one person. so many terrible people i was forced to know, forced to pretend to be nice with and tolerated and had to accept just for her. just another big fat red flag to charge at and really just so sad; on my part and on hers. It seems I see my passive tolerance as a strength instead of a weakness and she sees her belligerent pettiness as a strength when in fact it exposes how weak she really is.

It all makes me so so devastatingly sad. 
 
Every breakup I've ever had I have yearned for the other person. I've called them or texted them or visited them wanting to reason with, to rationalize, to makes any sense of it all;  the synaptic pathways in my brain built for them demanding to fire the blood pumping through my heart and dick beckoning for them, yet after all this i've had zero interest in contacting her and really don't know if i ever will. 

it started just not wanting to spew the  toxicity  the vile rage and all the resentment that had built up, a kindness that she didn't afford me. Shocking i know. but I don't wanna blame her or damn her or shit on her. I don't want to hate her. i never did i still don't. but I don't wanna pity her or feel bad for her with all the sick twisted things she said, and done to hurt me it's just that  there's enough terrible things that have been said, that are out there and above all else she's extremely hurt, an extremely insecure mother of three whose own evil drunk mother drove her to being this terrible person as a point of pride, whose evil junkie dead cancerous ex husband bestowed upon her a lifelong burden of self deception. 

I don't need to add to it but what I am certain of is as long as she bears his name i will never, ever speak to her. nothing could be more indicative of her total denial of the unmitigated disaster she and she alone created for us to live in, one that i just sat by passively tended, absorbed, was eaten alive by. 

 i don't want to wish i never met her but i think it. i don't want to wish for her to burn in a hell that doesn't exist but i scream it out now and again. I don't want to forget her or her children, her son a person I absolutely adored and wished she would have let me be something other than a distant caretaker for. but she always kept me at arms length in that regard for her own convenience, her own escape plan, maintaining the lie her dead ex husband was a decent man at all was paramount. 

i want a full Mea Culpa, an epiphany moment of clarity, for her to look in a mirror and admit to herself she is the author of all her own problems and until she gets real help, until she stops drinking and smoking endlessly, it will never end. 
i loved her dearly and though there is so so much crazy dysfunction, if she was just nice, just had a sense of decency, i would have taken the abuse forever. Then again she can't even laugh at herself and i mean ever, doesn't know how to be wrong without having a man to blame, can't admit to doing things wrong or making mistakes, not ever, just a narcissistic bubble her mother imprisoned her in one she thinks is a shield a coat of arms to live by. All i wanted to do was pop it to puncture through so badly to free her to rescue her because fools like me confuse rescue with romance. 

there is of course a rationale for the way she acts; a high IQ offset by a corresponding low EQ, three kids neglected by their drug addict pseudo responsible dad, the one son who I have asserted multiple times is a gem of a person, parents who are drunks the mother highly abusing, the dad a sweet yet old school high functioning drunk she tries to emulate and clearly always wished had saved her from her god-awful mother.  

women that cheated and lied, they were nicer. women i've cheated on, nicer. Any parent or teacher, boss or co worker, friend, enemy, frenemy, dudes who threatened to kill me because their women's desire for me, no matter how mean competitive or cruel they were they were nicer. 

She told me to never contact her again, she has since casually texted me for sex and drunk called. she wrote a 'how i'm doing' text on our anniversary pondering the magic of our relationship while saying she'll never forgive me for us breaking up.  What a sick joke. Her little trauma dumpster. Her little whipping post. Her living sex toy. 

She has a tattoo that says 'kindness is cool'. Laugh you should. The irony as thick as clay since that defines her as the least cool person i've ever met and me as pretty much the coolest motherfucker ever for just idling by taking it all with compassion for her situation and total disregard from my own, something she never appreciated let alone considered for more than a fleeting moment or thought summarily dismissed as something i didn't deserve. 

i'll never forgive me for putting myself through hell but my somewhat obviously insane definition of love makes me so willing to suffer and that's my fault, my terrible terrible weakness and misread of what love is. Being treated poorly isn’t love being screamed at because your partner needs somebody to scream at isn’t being loved being hit because you’re partner needs to hit somebody isn’t love and never being apologized to and having every misdeed swept under the rug because you’re partner is drunk and doesn’t remember anything they do is the least loving thing any person could do to their partner never mind proclaiming them to be your soul mate while doing it. 

So while i'm going through this Mt Everest sized emotional detox, more like a tectonic plate, i wake up at night laughing and in tears, simultaneously exhilarated and terrified to be free of the trauma dump she made me into but so devastated that someone who calls me the love of her life felt she had the right, the need to treat me in such a way and just crushed by the fact that I allowed it accepted it tolerated it to the point where there's just no love left. Nothing of me emotionally left.

While I'm sure her spite and money have led her on her own sordid misadventures i still can't talk to women without feeling like i'm doing something wrong. Months have gone by and one after the other i choose not to flirt with not to have casual sex, that 'get over her fuck' just not something I want something I would feel so bad about. i'm ready to, finding comfort in solitude. 

 My relationship with my bandmate is ruined and thus the band feels wrong, my music is tainted by the incessant toxic conditioning i grew so accustomed to.  i'm reconnecting with family, family she would threaten to call in times when my ex was isolating and shaming me in her drunken tirades. 

i have my regrets of course but in regards to her there are few. Mostly they lay with myself and what i didn't do for this guy who had taken up so much of your time.  i did everything i possibly could within the boundaries she built and i accepted. And yet, I never got her a single present. Not one meaningful trinket.  How did that happen? Was I her present? no funds? fear of her? no confidence to draw that tattoo i promised? a history of others destroying me with the gifts i laid before them? awareness of her vengeful spite knowing full well anything i ever got her would have been stacked in those boxes for me when i left? Perhaps.  I sacrificed every bit of me for her but didn't she deserve something honoring her? Us? Of course she did. Ultimately it really is the only regret. One I have to live with.

 I have no idea what I want for myself except this simple truth; to be loved and always always treated with decency and kindness. someone once told me the most important quality you could find in a life partner was that they were always nice to you. quaint, simple, but so true.
Alright two things i want; the self autonomy a lost so long ago a vital ingredient for moving forward. 

 i mean, how did I let this happen? How did I let myself get pushed so far down? How did it go so far that i feel no love for this woman at all that I loved so much felt so right with somewhere so long ago? i knew better but disregarded all the warning signs because i believed in her, our mutual connection. At some point  i began regarding us as those two ubiquitous entities of some generic physics metaphor; an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object. nothing could be more accurate.

If you've gotten this far, thank you. Thank you for taking in this crazy absurd comically dark retelling of the last six years of my life. The more I look at it the more i question what the hell I was thinking and the more it screams to me of the hell i let myself exist in, one i willingly chose and am at the very least equal fault for and so I'll just leave this with the reference to a famous quote by a character on one of our favorite shows that i think often of and will hold onto for a long long time. Anyone stuck in the shit should find solace in. i just wish i was equipped with it years ago. 

""if you are going through hell, keep going"".

Essential Features to Consider When Designing Your Tiny Home on Wheels
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Designing a tiny home on wheels is an exciting journey that allows you to create a personalized living space while embracing a minimalist lifestyle. However, there are essential features that you need to consider to ensure that your tiny home offers comfort and functionality. Below are key considerations to keep in mind during the design process.

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-tiny-home-on-a-trailer?  
  
### Size and Layout

One of the first features to consider is the size and layout of your tiny home. A typical tiny home on wheels ranges from 100 to 400 square feet. Consider the following points:

- **Floor Plan:** Open floor plans can make small spaces feel larger. Choose a layout that flows well and maximizes the available square footage.
- **Multi-Functional Spaces:** Incorporate furniture that serves multiple purposes, such as a sofa that converts to a bed or a table that can expand for dining.
- **Storage Solutions:** Include built-in storage options such as shelves, cabinets, and under-bed storage to keep your space organized.

### Kitchen Essentials

The kitchen is a vital part of your tiny home design. A well-thought-out kitchen will enhance your living experience. Consider these elements:

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-tiny-home-on-a-trailer?  
  
- **Appliances:** Opt for compact, energy-efficient appliances like mini-fridges and two-burner stoves to save space.
- **Counter Space:** Ensure you have enough counter space for food preparation. A foldable or extendable countertop can be a great addition.
- **Storage:** Use vertical storage strategies like wall-mounted shelves and cabinets that go up to the ceiling.

### Bathroom Features

The bathroom in a tiny home should be both functional and comfortable. Here’s what to keep in mind:

- **Shower Options:** Consider a wet bath (where the toilet and shower are together) to save space or opt for a separate shower stall if layout permits.
- **Composting Toilet:** Many tiny home dwellers choose composting toilets for their eco-friendliness and water conservation.
- **Storage Solutions:** Use shelves and hooks for toiletries and towels to avoid clutter.

### Energy Efficiency

Creating an energy-efficient tiny home not only saves on utility costs but also minimizes your carbon footprint. Assess the following components:

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-tiny-home-on-a-trailer?  
  
- **Insulation:** Invest in high-quality insulation to keep your home comfortable year-round.
- **Solar Panels:** Consider installing solar panels to generate your own energy, which can power your appliances and lighting.
- **LED Lighting:** Use LED fixtures to reduce energy consumption while providing ample lighting.

### Outdoor Living Space

Don’t overlook the potential for outdoor living areas. Expanding your living space outdoors can bring you closer to nature. Keep these ideas in mind:

- **Deck or Patio:** A small deck can serve as a relaxing area for morning coffee or evening gatherings.
- **Awning or Shade Options:** Installing an awning will provide shade and protect you from weather elements.
- **Garden Space:** If space allows, consider adding planters or a small garden to enhance your outdoor area.

### Smart Technology

Integrating smart technology into your tiny home can enhance convenience and efficiency:

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-tiny-home-on-a-trailer?  
  
- **Smart Thermostats:** Control your heating and cooling remotely to save energy when not at home.
- **Smart Lighting:** Automate your lighting to create ambiance and save on energy costs.
- **Security Systems:** Invest in a security system that allows you to monitor your home while you’re away.

Designing a tiny home on wheels involves thoughtful consideration of size, layout, and essential features. By focusing on functionality and efficiency, you can create a cozy yet spacious living environment that meets your lifestyle needs. Remember to prioritize elements that resonate with you, ensuring your tiny home reflects your personality and values.

Hi everyone! 

I started at the lowest dose of Zepbound and just graduated to .5mg earlier this week. (5 weeks on it) My weight goes from 159 to 160 nearly everyday. I inject in my stretch mark covered stomach. 

Would love your feedback and tips: 

1) I'm thinking I should to get the most out of this before insurance decides I'm not fat enough. 

2) if I drink coffee on an empty stomach I experience vomiting and diarrhea. Never happened before so I figure it's the Zep. Anyone else? 

3) I have dry eyes and noticed my eyes are evener drier. My doctor didn't mention this as a side effect and I didn't come across it watching YT videos on Zep. Anyone else experience this?

Thanks and wish you all the best! ",0,1735361471.0,Zepbound,6,0.2,False
1hny7q6,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1hny7q6/90_lbs_lost_since_2021_25_lbs_in_the_last_3/,"90+ lbs lost since 2021 (25+ lbs in the last 3 months), some advice and tips","#Broader weight loss (starting 2021)
In April 2021, I reached 252 lbs and decided I had to make a change. For reference I'm 5'10, male, and was 20 at the time (24 now). I was stuck doing online classes because of COVID, so while I was already overweight before, I got careless and let the number climb. I chomped down on snacks all the time (I had a Pringles weakness) and didn't care about sugar content in drinks (I worked at a fast food restaurant where employees got free drinks on shift...). Starting April that year, no more. 

To start with, I cut out almost all snacks and started only drinking water, diet soda, and very lightly sweetened coffee. I started counting calories too, not that rigorously but enough so that I was aware of how much I was eating a day. And it really was as simple as CICO because by August or September I was down to 210 with only minimal exercise (playing basketball with friends every week or two and some light biking). I'd say 80% of that initial weight loss was from watching how much food I ate.

I also tracked my weight in Excel every single day, once in the morning and once in the evening. The specific number each day doesn't matter. It'll fluctuate based on when you eat, how much water weight you're holding onto, and your digestive status. The important thing is the trend. If you are eating less calories than you are taking in, you'll lose weight. Many times, I noticed my weight was the same for two weeks or so, even though I was at a deficit, then one random day I just pissed out 3 pounds. I lost some of the data so I can't share it but it was satisfying to watch the graph inch down week by week.

In August/September 2021, I went back to university and expected to lose weight even faster since I'd be walking around campus instead of sitting on my ass. But my weight loss actually slowed down. I got under 200 by the end of 2021 but by May or June 2022 I was still in the upper 190s. This was probably because I was back to eating fast food most days, and while I tried to make smart choices, I ended up eating more calories than back when I was at home, enough to cancel out whatever added calories I was burning from walking around campus more. And for more reinforcement that diet matters much more than exercise, I started a WFH job in summer 2022 and quickly got down to 190 despite being on my ass in my chair most of the day just because I was eating less than I was on campus.

I got complacent and got back up to 200 by the end of 2022, but I trickled back down to 190 by summer 2023. Around then I got a Fitbit which was amazing. I started watching the amount of calories I was burning every day and making my eating choices based on that, and I also started biking more than I had in the past, so I got to 180 by the end of the year. I noticed the 180s were when I started getting comments from people seeing I'd lost weight, which felt pretty good even though I was still overweight. But then I got back to the upper 180s in 2024 (because of a fried chicken restaurant I started frequenting enough that the guys had my order rung up by the time I'd walked in the front door) and hovered around that weight for most of this year. 

#Recent, sharper weight loss (starting October 2024)
And now for the part I'm most proud of. In early October this year, at which point I was about 187, some of my friends were talking fitness. One of them said something like ""I need to cut 10 pounds"" and it was just the casual simplicity with which he said it that randomly inspired me, made me understand that when fitter people talked about cutting, it was a straightforward, structured, active goal and not a thoughtless, back-of-mind process as my ""weight loss"" had been since late 2021. So inside I was like, alright I'm going to cut. I still wasn't looking as I'd have liked, and being passive with it was at best going to have me hover around the same weight going forward. The rest of those pounds weren't going to lose themselves.

So I got rigorous with it. I was still doing my daily weight tracking, but I also added some columns to track calories in and out. With CI, I estimated as best as I could from menus or labels. I still ate a shitton of fast food, I just made sure it was my only meal for the day (or like 80% of my daily calories depending on what). Keep in mind that at some places, the portion sizes are variable, like Chipotle or Panda Express. I have a suspicion that my usual meal from Panda Express (white rice, orange chicken, teriyaki chicken), which is nominally about 1210 calories, is really 1500 or so because they always load the fuck out of my plate. So I shifted mostly to packaged things which are more consistent with their portion sizes. 

Generally, I try not to eat over 1200 on normal weekdays. I'm WFH so I'm not burning many calories on an average day, usually 2100 if I sit at home all day or 2300 if I'm doing something, according to my Fitbit. My usual weekday routine is a breakfast of a coffee and a yogurt or bar (150-200 calories) and then either one large meal (~1000 calories) or two smaller meals (~500 calories each). I don't feel very hungry or tired throughout the day, and honestly I feel like I have more energy than I did before I reduced my intake. I will eat a little more if I anticipate burning more calories that day, enough so my daily deficit stays around at least 700 but preferably 1000+. That's for weekdays. On weekends I have a different routine. I bike for an hour and a half each Saturday and Sunday. That combined with more activity from errands, socializing, etc. puts my CO for weekends around 3500. On those days I let myself eat 1500-1800 calories, and depending on how much I do that day, maybe even 2000. (I've only eaten over 2000 six days since October 7th. On all six I've burned over 3500, four of them over 4000, and one over 5000.)

Keep in mind that (at least in my experience) the Fitbit tends to overestimate CO and you tend to underestimate CI. I have logged an average deficit of almost 1400 since the start of October, and if that were true I should have lost over 30 lbs by now, which I haven't (only about 25). I created another column on my spreadsheet to ""adjust"" the deficit by subtracting some for each day. I found subtracting 400 gives an average close to my experienced reality (so a ""real"" 1000 deficit). But again, your exact weight fluctuates. The whole idea behind this is to look at the long-term trend. Case in point, let's look at my data week by week.

Week | Avg. weight | Avg. deficit
---|---|----
Sep. 30 | 186 | N/A
Oct. 7 | 183 | 1350
Oct. 14 | 180 | 1600
Oct. 21 | 178 | 1700
Oct. 28 | 176 | 1500
Nov. 4 | 175 | 1200
Nov. 11 | 174 | 1350
Nov. 18 | 172 | 1300
Nov. 25 | 169 | 1500
Dec. 2 | 168 | 1100
Dec. 9 | 165 | 1150
Dec. 16 | 165 | 1500
Dec. 23 | 163 | 1300

So even though the deficits are similar, some weeks I lose more or less than others. This morning I was 162. Maybe tomorrow I'll be 163, or 161. But as long as the deficits are there, that weight *will* trend downwards if you aren't wildly underestimating CI or overestimating CO. Trust the process. And note that the deficits generally decrease over time; I think that's because as I lose weight, my body expends less energy maintaining itself as there's less to maintain.

My target from the beginning was 170 as that was about when I'd graduate from an overweight BMI to a normal one (for the first time since what, 3rd grade?). But as they say, BMI isn't everything. When I got down into the 190s I first realized I wouldn't be ""slim"" at 170. I kept the goal but inside I was like alright, I'll see how I look then and keep going depending on what I feel. And yeah, at 170 I was still flabby even if I was overall much thinner than I used to be. Even now at 162 I've got a fair bit of belly fat. Maybe it won't be until 150 that most of it's gone. But my man-boobs started disappearing below 180 and were pretty much gone below 170, which is nice. I have lost a bit of muscle mass: in the 180s I could bench around 5x135 but now I can only do 5x115. But I don't lift often (a short session every 1-2 weeks) since the bulk of my exercise is cardio (biking), so I think I could build that back up with some dedicated training and macro-watching (which I have not paid attention to nearly as much as calories).

Overall I feel much better than I did 4 years ago and honestly it shouldn't have taken me 4 years to lose all this weight. If I was as dedicated as I was in the last three months, I could probably have done the whole 90+ lbs in a year or less. And more than anything, I wish I had this dedication back when I was younger. I was at a good weight until 3rd grade, but around then my eating habits started going to shit and I put on the pounds. I crossed 100 going into 4th grade, 130 going into 6th, 190 sometime in 8th, and then midway through 9th I was like 215. All throughout those years I had some random bursts of inspiration to start losing weight (mostly because of girls), all of which started with like a week or two of exercise which fizzled out and then very little diet change. I did level off a bit as I grew since I stayed around 200-220 throughout high school, but then in college and with COVID (and the fast food job I started in senior year of HS), I got up to 252. I'd definitely rather be fat as an adult than as a kid. I wish I could go back in time and scream at myself to just fucking count the calories. When I have kids I'm not going to let this happen to them.

But yeah, if you're on a journey or considering one, I hope this was useful as inspiration. Last note, be ready to redo your wardrobe! I wore size Larges since 8th grade and was even starting to wear XLs when I was over 230. Now most Mediums are too big. (Recently I tried on a school shirt from 7th grade when I was still like 5'1 and deadass it fits perfectly now.) My favorite shirt is a Medium I bought at 185, and it was already a little bit baggy then but is super baggy now. If you go shop for new clothes and are between two sizes, buy the smaller one.",5,1735361445.0,loseit,0,0.86,False

It's her first play, but honestly, she steals the show.  I'm so smitten that I've become this weird, lovesick detective, constantly trying to anticipate her needs.  Like, I noticed she never ate the meat sandwiches at the potluck, so I whipped up a batch of potato sandwiches just for her.  Of course, I pretended I'd made them for ""whoever the vegetarian might be,"" but come on, it was totally for her.
And then there was the time she mentioned forgetting her makeup remover. Boom! I ""just happened"" to have a whole pack tucked away in my bag.  Or when she needed speakers?  Mini speaker, right here! It's like I'm some kind of walking, talking emergency kit, fueled by a desperate crush.
The other day, she looked exhausted during the show, and I swear, my heart ached.  So, what did I do?  I made a grand entrance backstage with a steaming cup of coffee, just for her. Okay, fine, I made coffee for the entire cast and crew, but she was the only one I truly cared about.  The way her face lit up and she gave me that kiss on the cheek... worth every penny of that ridiculously overpriced coffee.
Sometimes, our eyes meet across the room, and it's like the world stops spinning.  She pulls my sleeve when she laughs, and we find ourselves sitting next to each other, giggling like idiots.  She even asked me for a mini guitar lesson! And once, just once, she held my hand. It was brief, but electric.
But nothing, absolutely nothing, compares to the hug we shared before our first performance. It was quick, but oh-so-tight, like she was holding on for dear life.  I could feel her eyes closed, her toes barely touching the ground.  It was as if all the emotions she'd been holding back came pouring out in that one embrace.  I swear, I floated for a good five minutes afterward.
Look, I know this all sounds crazy. Maybe I am delusional. But there's this tiny, persistent voice inside me that whispers, ""She's the one.""  And honestly? I really, really hope that voice is right.

 I want to take it slow and really get to know and learn about each other instead of speeding through it.

Austin has several great Y's plus Round Rock and surrounding areas have some really nice ones. Here's the sell:

* It's dang cheap. I think our family membership- 2 adults, 2 kids- is $95 all in. And that gets us in at any Y in the states
* If you have kids, you get 2 hours of child care free every day. *Most* Y's do not reciprocate this benefit, so this is only good here in Austin, but it's still a damn good deal. Get in a work out or hop in the hot tub. Many Y's have community spaces and free coffee, so it can be a great place to get work done.
* Many fitness classes are included- Weight lifting, Spin, Yoga etc. Other classes, Adult Swim etc., are offered at cheap rates.
* Indoor Pools and Hot Tubs offer year round chances to get in a dip. Some Y's, like Round Rock, even have small lazy rivers and water slides. 
* Many of Austin's Y's (Northwest + East) have great outdoor swim areas with beach entrance, splash pads and water slides. 
* Many Y's also have special facilities- Runberg+Lamar has a Teen Tech area, Round Rock has an E-Sports area etc.
* Lots of events around the holidays!

Anyway, I just think it's a damn good deal and that Austin has especially great YMCA facilities. I'd love to see some of them better utilized!

1hny2qr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ENGLISH/comments/1hny2qr/arrange_sentences_problem_is_c_or_d_right/,Arrange sentences problem: is C or D right?,"In this question my answer is C but the correct answer given by my school is D

The difference between C and D is in the order of sentence a and sentence c. I think for choice D, c-a doesn't make sense at all.

I think sentence a meaning is that the character was expressing an exausting feeling after a long flight and he had just arrived at Paris. And only then after that he ""couldn't wait to see the famous landmarks"" and went to see Paris in sentence c. ""and, I was finally there, standing in front of the Eiffel Tower"". I think a-c order is chronological.

For c-a order, the character was standing in front of the Eiffel and then suddenly he ""couldn't wait to see the famous landmarks???"", he was already there, wasn't he? How did this make sense at all.

For the b-d-e or d-e-b part, I think I still don't really agree with whatever sentence order is made. But b-d-e seems like the most prominent choice given here so I can just barely accept (he was sitting at a coffee, enjoying his coffee, then he realized he had left his camera at the table when he still hadn't gone anywhere, still in the coffee shop?).

So, I'm a broke university student. Like, ramen-noodle-water-as-soup level broke. But I figured I could beat the system. You see, I was convinced that with the right parlays and ""sure things,"" I could turn my meager bank account into something worthy of a Drake music video. Spoiler: I was wrong. Very, very wrong.

It started innocently enough. A $10 bet here, $20 there. Then, one weekend, I hit a small win. Nothing crazy, but enough to make me think, ""Hey, maybe I’m good at this."" That's the trap. One minute you're feeling like Rain Man, the next you're watching your carefully crafted 6-leg parlay crumble because some rookie missed a layup.

Before I knew it, I was down over $2,000. I don't even know how it happened. One day I'm budgeting for coffee, the next I'm calculating how many plasma donations it would take to break even.

Desperate times call for creative measures. Since I’m a graphic design major, I figured I could put my skills to use instead of betting on whether or not a 19-year-old can hit a free throw under pressure. I'm officially opening up shop for design gigs.

Custom Requests: Let’s chat, I’ll work with your budget!

So, if any of you out there want to support a fellow degenerate who learned the hard way that betting isn't a career path, hit me up. I promise your designs will be cleaner than my betting history.

Thanks for reading, and may the odds be ever in your favor (because they definitely weren't in mine).

I’m feeling a bit bored today and thought it’d be nice to meet new people or chat with someone who could potentially be a constant in my life. I’m 33F, 5’6, and I’ve been told I look younger than my age. I’d say I’m someone who takes care of myself, carries myself well, and loves smelling good (important, right?).

I’m heading out today and thought, why not leave things up to chance? If you’re tall, professional, mabango, mabait, and down for a spontaneous coffee meetup, message me! Let’s see if we vibe—it could lead to meaningful conversations, or maybe more, who knows?

Bonus points if you’re consistent and genuinely looking for a connection. If this sounds like something you’re up for, let’s trade pics on Telegram and see where this day takes us!

1hnxry6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hnxry6/chronically_time_blind_friends/,Chronically Time Blind Friends,"Title says it all. 

I have been losing my temper and considering cutting off friends who are chronically late, or lie about their ETA - causing me to wait around on them. For casual meet ups, there’s a little bit of leeway (I.e; meeting at a coffee shop). But for dinner reservations, movies, booked tours, or pre determined meeting places where I’m just twiddling my thumbs it infuriates me! 

That being said, I am not 100% sure these things are worth losing friendships over. 

•Yes, I have talked to them about it

•Yes, sometimes I lie about meeting earlier and they are still late to the fake time 

•Yes, there is potentially undiagnosed considerations like ADHD

Any advice is so appreciated! 

Chronically late people:

•What causes you to be so late?

•Do you feel bad?

•Do you consider chronic, repetitive lateness to be an indication that you do not much value or like the person you are meeting?

•What type of feedback would make you feel more inclined to be prompt?

I want to respect my friends and be considerate before “popping off” but I also feel incredibly disrespected at the same time.

I (18f) am going on my first first date this weekend and I’m really excited, he seems really nice but I can be awkward in social situations and I’m looking for advice.

I never know when to end a hang out with friends and that can result in it feeling like I’m dragging things out and I don’t have anything left to say but I don’t know when it’s the right time to part ways or how to do that and it’s really awkward. How do I know when it’s over so I can let it end naturally rather then drag it out so long that neither of us want to be there? Shouldn’t it end before we are ready to leave so we both want to see each other again?

I have never been on a date before. We met online, I wasn’t really expecting anything to come from a dating app but we started talking and so far we have had some great conversations and I really like him.  

When we were planning to get coffee, the words used by both of us were that we would like to hang out. we didn’t use the word date so how do I determine if this is like a friendship situation or if he’s interested in more than that?? I am notoriously awful at picking up signals when someone is interested in me. Like so so bad.

We are getting coffee and I am STRESSING. Like when do we leave and how do we part ways? What is some important date etiquette? What do I do if I don’t know what to say? Very important: what do I wear??? I don’t want to be over or under dressed.

Thank you. Any and all first date advice would be appreciated.",4,1735359867.0,TooAfraidToAsk,11,0.7,False

When I started focusing on losing weight about 2+ years ago I would run, do weights, and try to eat less. I didn’t see much progress with my weight and it was a constant cycle of losing weight and gaining it back. The most I would lose was 5 pounds and then it will come back. I had a moment where my jeans weren’t fitting anymore and I just couldn’t anymore.

What really helped me was giving up sugar/coffee, and eating less portion. After a month of giving up caffeine I instantly started seeing the weight shed off. I am not too sure if caffeine was messing up my hormones but I did see my hirsutism get worse when I was eating/drinking sugar. I am not really on a diet just eating less/more fruit.

Running and lifting weights helped with burning a lot of the calories. I deal with alot of stress in my personal life and running has helped me release most of that stress. I have become more happier during the day.

So far, I lost 50 pounds and still have another 50 to go. One of the challenges that I am still facing is my hirsutism it did not improve even with the weight loss. I currently have hair on my chest, breast, and butt and honestly this has been messing with me mentally. I been lasering my hair off and it has been working but sadly I would never get that permanent solution. Lasering has reduce my hair in different areas but I am too scared to use it on my chest/breast.

I am hopeful that I will continue to lose weight and get to my ideal weight. There is light in the tunnel it’s not always beautiful but you will get there.

Any advice for dealing with hirsutism would be great. I want to avoid using birth control.",1,1735359766.0,PCOS,0,0.67,False

One of them sounded completely burned out, venting about juggling her therapy sessions with endless administrative work—answering random calls, managing appointments, sending reminders, and so on. The other therapist casually suggested hiring a receptionist, but the first one sighed and said, “That would be nice… if I could afford it.”

That moment stuck with me, and it inspired an idea. What if there was a way for therapists to have all the benefits of a receptionist—without the cost or complexity?

Fast forward, and here we are. My team and I built an AI Receptionist designed specifically for therapists. It answers calls, schedules appointments, follows up with clients, and even handles intake assessments (if that’s needed). It’s like having a full-time assistant, but way more affordable.

We’re inviting therapists to try it out and share their feedback. If you’re curious or want to see how it works, Comment “Show me” and I’ll reach out. We’d love to give you early access and hear your thoughts!",0,1735359274.0,askatherapist,4,0.22,False
