1ljsd07,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ljsd07/my_47f_and_my_partner_48m_have_experienced_a/,"My (47F) and my partner (48M) have experienced a minor upset in our otherwise so-far ""perfect"" 6mth relationship but even though the situation is mostly resolved to our mutual satisfaction my gut is telling me to end it","(Throwaway and minor details changed in attempt to remain anonymous)

I need external input and advice into navigating the recent (and so far only) upset in my relationship of 6mths with my partner. The upset in of itself is fairly minor in the grand scheme of things, but it has caused doubt in my mind as to our long term compatibility.

It's a very new relationship, around 6mths, and up until 48hrs ago was hands down the best relationship of my life. Actually, even after the last 48hrs this is probably still true and if possible I'd like to keep it that way.

Background: The last 10yrs have been rough for me. I was in an (emotionally, financially, borderline physically) abusive relationship that I finally broke out of 7yrs ago, leaving me with sole care of 3 children (the youngest only 8mths at the time), mountains of debt, no family or friends locally to support me with childcare and yet to finish training in my chosen professional career. 

Skip forward to present times: I persevered and came out the other end. Training, completed. Debt, gone. I am now established in my well-paid career track, and two years ago I took the opportunity to relocate a significant distance away from my abusive ex (who you will all be unsurprised to learn subsequently became an abusive father and no longer has unsupervised access to his children.)

None of this was easy: I came closer to being bankrupt than I care to admit, and I was in survival mode so long it became my normal. I remained single throughout this time by both choice and necessity because I didn't have a free minute to go on a date, let alone nurture a relationship.

I am also AuDHD (ADHD dominant) and my children are (again, unsurprisingly) all AuDHD. We are a loud, messy but loving household. Too messy, in all honesty: the problem with packing your life up and moving a few thousand miles to somewhere you've never lived before and know no one in order to take up a full time job whilst also being a full time mom of three young kids is you never have the time to properly unpack. My house is cluttered. I hate it, it really is not me at all. It brings my mood down significantly but after working 10hrs and getting home to deal with 3 hyper children I don't have it in me to then tackle the piles of stuff that a family of 4 can create. I do pay for a weekly cleaner so everything is clean and safe, it's just... cluttered. Every time I clear one pile, life / my children create another, and whilst I know I have made progress over the last 2yrs it is slow (but also not worth my mental health beating myself up to do it when I'm already near-permanently exhausted anyway.)

Six months ago on a whim and out of curiosity I downloaded a dating app. The first guy I chatted to I went on a coffee date with 12hrs later. 24hrs later I had deleted the dating app. We mutually told each other we loved each other a month later. He is everything I thought I'd never find in a partner: kind, funny, trustworthy, generous, supportive, loving, great with the kids. I honestly thought I had a better chance of winning the lottery. I am besotted.

He seems to be similarly besotted with me, and I do not have any cause to doubt how he feels about me. Since we started dating he has realised he is also AuDHD (ASD dominant) and I have done my best to support him with all of the life and personal insights this has brought him. It has been a positive experience for him, but obviously he's still coming to grips with what it all means.

He is a divorcee with no kids. He remains on good/friendly terms with his ex-wife. It seems they grew apart rather than there being some seismic event that broke them up. I have never met her (but wouldn't have an issue with doing so) but from hearing him talk of her she (to me) clearly has undiagnosed ASD. He has mentioned that she had really high expectations of how clean and tidy their house should be when they were together and he constantly failed to achieve her standards despite his best efforts. He now lives alone. Since she moved out he keeps his house clean and tidy; there is no clutter and at the end of each day he tidies and puts everything away. He has said that it's not to what her standards would have been but after years of trying to support her cleanliness needs it has become his standard.

Can you see where this is going yet?

Day before yesterday he came for dinner at mine; we spend the majority of time at my place because the kids are still young (oldest is 11yrs) and despite now being financially comfortable, I cannot afford the babysitting costs that would allow me to spend time at his in the evenings very often.

The kids have become very comfortable to his presence, and for the first time my oldest had a meltdown (non-violent) in my partner's presence. I would have interceded but I was also dealing with the middle-child having a mini-meltdown AND getting my youngest to sleep. I kept an ear on what was happening with my oldest though and honestly, my partner was handling it so well I didn't feel at any point that I needed to step in and I was mostly extremely grateful I was only being pulled in two directions instead of the usual three (evenings are a fraught time as standard; everyones ritalin has worn off and everyone is over-tired. It gets emotional.)

When my youngest was finally asleep (the other two already in their beds) I joined my partner on the sofa to find him very upset, anxious and clearly over-stimulated by all noise and shouting that comes with an 11yr old verbally lashing out in frustration. Honestly, I knew this moment was coming and if anything I'm impressed it has taken as long as it has. I comforted him and apologised and did my best to help him calm down to the point we could go to bed. It is important to note that him being this upset due to my child's actions / my failed recognition of needing to step in is simultaneously triggering my rejection sensitivity dysphoria, but I didn't express any of that to him because he was the one in need in that moment.

The next morning he is still upset and anxious, and that is reasonable and fair. He is not a parent, and parenting neurodivergent kids is a whole extra parenting level. I reinforce to him that it's okay to feel over-stimulated by the previous evening, that he had handled it perfectly, and that it's okay for him to step back and take the time he needed to recover from it. And then he hit me with the ""but...""

""I love you but I have this niggle [...] I need some space""

That's the point I lost it. My rsd kicked into full effect. I remained calm initially but I could feel parts of my brain shutting down. I couldn't look at him, I couldn't speak. Then I started crying. I never cry, haven't cried in years because there gets to be a point where you've experienced so much trauma you can't cry any more. But I cried. I could only interpret his statement as being that he wanted a break with the intention of ending things with me, and my heart just broke right there and then.

Lots of talking ensued once I was finally able to speak; it started with me saying he could have all the space he needed, no question, but could he please have the grace to decide to call time on us sooner rather than later if that's where this was going. He stated he didn't know what it was he wanted, just that everything felt very raw and he needed time to himself for a bit. We eventually agreed that what we had was worth working through this for and that he was confident the time he needed was just to recover, not to analyse whether he wanted to call time.

[Of note: we have discussed him gradually stepping into a parent role for my children; when we first started dating he was very clear he (at the time) wanted to be a parent; him being introduced into my children's lives was done gradually and at a pace comfortable for everyone involved; I am very deliberately not giving him any parenting responsibilities (like solo care or collecting from school) and have no plans or expectations to do so until he expresses to me that he wants to and is ready; and I have always been clear that I have no expectation he must step into the role (with the proviso that ultimately the kids and I are a package deal so if he decided he didn't want to be significantly involved in their lives inevitably it would mean he wouldn't be significantly involved in mine either.)]

We kept talking through breakfast and it was while sat in my kitchen surrounded by clutter that he expressed one of the contributing factors to his being on edge was the amount of clutter in my house. This is fair, and as previously mentioned also affects me but ultimately my life is a series of compromises and this is one of them. We have previously discussed this, he has offered to help, I have agreed to him helping me but have also made it clear that I do not have the time or cognitive resource to approach it as an activity at the moment due to other demands on my time. I have been planning to book a couple of weeks PTO from work that I have saved to tackle it in a few months time (but as a single parent, using PTO for house tidying and not child care or other emergencies feels extremely decadent.)

He then offered to help me here and now to clear some of the piles of clutter. Now, I'm in an extremely precarious place emotionally. I do not want to start tidying because I am exhausted, I am cognitively depleted from what has been happening, I am not going to be able to make decisions about where the items of clutter need to be put away to; however I am also feeling extremely precarious in our relationship and that refusal might push him to feel I am not invested in us. So I agree to tidy. He helped me for a few hours and then I needed to get the kids from school and back to parenting grind.

And now my kitchen is still cluttered - better than it was, no argument - but now I just have piles of unorganised clutter in boxes on the floor instead of organised clutter hidden in drawers. And it's on me and only me to finish the work I didn't even want to start.

I barely sleep at all last night from the stress of what happened yesterday, and the new stress of being aware of the immediate time demand of needing to sort the kitchen out.  I have 10hrs of work today to get through having had a single hour of sleep before going home, getting the children through their evening routines and into bed... and then I'm going to have to keep tidying the damn kitchen.

Additionally I am feeling shamed by him (which I'm confident is unintentional on his part, he really did just want to help) and resentful of this extra burden he has precipitated of demand on my already limited resources. I have a sense (not voiced directly by him but my interpretation of the situation) that decluttering is a key metric in him wanting to continue the relationship. That sense of interpreted obligation is overwhelming me. My rsd is still oscillating and causing me emotional lability that I'm reigning in through sheer will alone. I cried in the shower this morning.

Now it is me that is experiencing the niggle.

My gut is telling me to call time on us. That even though it'll hurt it's better to cut and run now rather than later when we are even more enmeshed but I haven't managed to declutter to his satisfaction. I am resentful that a person that lives alone and has only his mess to be responsible for is judging me as a single parent with three hyperactive and messy children working 50hrs a week as to the state of how tidy my house is (this resentment is unfair because I know he is acting from a place of love but intent does not dictate impact.) I am also resentful that a person who (after investing the time required to their undertake their tidying duties) has plenty of time in their life to indulge their various hobbies and other social extra-curriculars is telling me, a person whose only hobby is trying to get 6hrs sleep a night, that I need to do more. Again, not directly, but that's what it boils down to. Additionally I've got the standard demands of my work, plus caring for my children, plus trying to navigate the extra stress of two of my children being bullied in school (which is contributing to them acting out at home where they feel safe to).... like, are you for real that you think the pile of papers on my kitchen counter is something I care about right now?!

I suspect this is just my trauma response kicking in though. I love him, I can't imagine the rest of my life without him in it. I want to eventually live with him and share our lives completely but I currently feel like we have a fundamental incompatibility that makes this impossible. I told him when we were talking things out that I would rather stay with him and live separately than not be in his life at all but now that I've had time to reflect I am realising that that is not true and cannot be true. If we were to live apart I would grow to resent his freedom and ability to dip in and out of our lives as he fancied whilst I continue as I am. I do not expect that he must share all my responsibilities but by the same measure I'm not going to disrespect myself enough to allow him to keep warm by the fire of my self-immolation either.

I do not need decluttering advice - that is the Iranian yoghurt of this situation! I don't know where to go from here though. Accept my life is too much of a bin fire for me to be in a relationship and call time now? Try and find some sort of compromise? 48hrs ago everything was great and now suddenly it is very much not and I am at a loss. I can't think straight and don't want to make a decision in haste that I then get to repent at leisure.

Not least because I don't get much leisure time.

TL:DR - my 6mth relationship has gone from being issue-free 48hrs ago to suddenly feeling like we have a significant incompatibility. This has left me feeling thinking I should end things now rather than inevitably break up later when things will be more painful. I don't know how much of this feeling is a trauma response on my part and if I'm being too hasty or jumping to conclusions and I think I need external perspectives to help navigate where I go from here.",1,1750813178.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

long post ahead, i’m sorry, free time ko and obviously wala kasi akong ibang mapagshare-an

we’re currently in our early 20s. crazy pa rin ako for this woman. she motivated me to go from *nangungutang to take her to a simple php150 coffee date*, to *taking her to steak dinner casually or kahit late night tagaytay trip pa with my own car*. all within just a matter of 3 years. doing/achieving more than most sa age ko, despite that i’m thinking she’s slowly losing interest sakin

context (timeline):
- great highschool love
- recently we broke a 2 yrs no contact
- she stated no romance ang priority
- we’ve already gone to meets/trips for the past months
- found out she created a bumble acc, gamit pics i took, she matched and hi’d someone i know na may “intimacy w/o commitment” tag
- i got pressured manligaw but got rejected ‘coz she has other plans pa raw
- mutual agreement na forget i tried manligaw nalang para di awkward
- i carelessly created a bumble rin na may w/o commitment tag, for her to see kasi we’re 1km apart, and ayoko kasi isipin niya dependent or tigang of sort ako to her after the ligaw attempt
- we’re back to planned meet, to just vibe, w/o even discussing any of the ligaw or bumble happenings
- found she has a new pic w/ some random dude sa club thru a friend’s post recently, i learned na mutual na rin niya
- thanks sa time if ya reached this part of the list
- she now has deactivated her socmed for weeks which got me thinking and make this post na rin

context (etc):
- 2 years na rin kami hindi mutuals sa socmed ‘til now, we have other means of contact kahit na deactivated pa siya
- btw dry ang texts namin, ako mostly ang nagiinitiate, pero kapag in-person madaldal siya
- we were sexually active 2 yrs ago, parang sexcapade for months (1st time nmin + hormones), but now i can’t even initiate it when we go out i get a “kalma lang” response 
- i just realized after our meets/trips this year, wala pa rin kaming pic na together
- she sometimes abruptly stop texting mid convo, despite that consistent ang pag view niya sa ig stories ko with her burner account (i don’t see any other girls, so sakanya lang yon lol)
- i recently texted her for a sponty meet and got negats response, will attempt to try a planned meet soon

previous attempts:
n/a.. i didn’t bother asking her what her other plans was when i tried manligaw, since maybe it may come off as too forward, i can only guess and that maybe she’s still exploring..? we have this ruckus before the 2yr no contact, nakipag hiwalay siya, akala ko tapos na legit kaya i hooked up w/ someone else. she reached back and i discussed it with her, then we mutually settled na mag no contact muna (busy sya sa studies & ako naman sa career as dropout)

It was very bad, I went to an urgent care because I thought I was just being a baby but my nurse ran out of the room upon taking my vitals and got the doctor to triage me for the hospital I'd be going to (he tried to call an ambulance but I am broke lol) so I got care as soon as I walked into the ER due to some note he made on my paperwork. My resting pulse was 260 so I had to get an EKG, my low WBC (3.77) was very concerning, I was bleeding a lot which worsened my previously barely-notable anemia. It's suspected I was beginning to get kidney damage because I wouldn't pee much, when I did it was brown and cloudy, started to get protein in my urine, had the typical back pain. But anyway, was put on lots of medication and fluids and was on the mend. 
Then, about 1 week later someone in my house brought home covid which I caught. It was very rough on my body, the most notable symptoms being bad shortness of breath and very fast heart rate. It was hard to even sleep because of those symptoms. 
My reason for posting is that I'm worried that my organs were damaged? 
Beforehand I would drink a cup or two of coffee a day or occasionally an energy drink, and wouldn't even really feel it (I have hypotension/low blood pressure, it'd just help that a little). I drank a red bull the other day and felt like I was going to die lmao my heart couldn't take it. (Being dramatic but I did not react well to it at all). 
My hair has also been thinning a lot but in addition to the worsened anemia I have had a vitamin D deficiency for years so I'm assuming it's related to that, though I've also seen people say it's something that can happen after having sepsis. ",1,1750812763.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Hi train experts of Reddit! I'm a tarot reader/fortune teller and I'm studying one particular deck named Maybe Lenormand, by artist Ryan Edward. The Petit Lenormand deck is based on the coffee grounds symbols popularized in Europe and other divinatory influences from Germany and France during the 19th century.

However, Edward's version includes 16 extra cards to the traditional 36, being one of them **THE TRAIN**, and I'm struggling to understand what this ""card/symbol"" could have represented for the people of the time.

What did trains represent in the collective imagination around the world during the 19th century Industrial Revolution?",4,1750812359.0,trains,2,0.83,False

1ljs2wh,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ljs2wh/there_is_no_money_in_the_coffee_business/,There is no money in the coffee business.,"I might get a lot of hate for this but anyone who owns a coffee shop or a coffee business barely makes any livable money. The reason most open a coffee shop is because they are really passionate about coffee and have been making coffee their entire life ( worked as a barista) and thought that opening a coffee business would be a vialble business but in reality working a 9-5 job is much better with guranteed pay, holidays and stress free mind. The risk-reward ratio for opening and running a coffee business is extremely high considering how much investment it takes to open a coffee shop for extremely low profit margin.

A friend of mine runs a speciality coffee shop with only 3 employees and has a revenue of over 700k, yet he barely makes 70k on net profit. He was working as a designer and making 95k with unlimited PTO at a tech company before this but now he only takes 1 day off a week for the past 2 years.",4,1750812344.0,smallbusiness,14,0.83,False
1ljs2ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1ljs2ef/enamored_hearts/,Enamored Hearts,"It wasn't love at first sight. It was lust. The moment she walked into the bar she had my full attention. I noticed everything about her. How her long dark raven hair flowed down her back in waves. The wondrous vixen's long legs moving daintily in her tight dark grey leggings as though she knew how attractive she was and I wouldn't be surprised if it was on purpose. Her hips were perfect and her breasts full and sumptuous in her grey silver blouse. Her neck slender and jawline perfectly feminine. And of all the men in the bar she had looked at, she could have chose, those lively sage green eyes fell upon me. Her thin lips curved into a open smirk. Which I suppose was only fair since I suppose I must have been gaping like a hungry wolf at her. But the difference between me and every other dumb bastard in that bar was far and away and quite staggering if i'm being honest; I wasn't some rich wall street yuppie, but I made enough to stand out. I am pretty damn good looking too with the blended physique of strength and aesthetics. A little fat to be honest but in all the right places if you know what I mean.

I shut my mouth and grinned softly and thought about waving her over to me but decided fuck that, as we both appeared to share the same thought; For a brief moment I wondered if it was deeper than lust as we both started towards each other, nonchalantly and with easy strides, as though nothing and no one else in the bar mattered. Which to me, didn't.

""Hey there, good looking,""

I just couldn't help myself and I was surprised how confident I sounded saying it too. Even more surprised by how I boldly wrapped a powerful arm tight around her waist and pulled her against me, feeling just how warm she was and I was sure glad I did help myself in not getting too excited. Just barely though as I watched that smirk become an open lovely grin.

""Aren't you pretty bold?"" She laughed with what I thought was embarrassment.

But then I found out it was amusement from how she looked at me without any blush on her pale face as she didn't try to push me away; Instead pushing herself against me further as she grabbed my free wrist affectionately, those lively sage green eyes never leaving my azure blue eyes.

I honestly couldn't think of anything charismatic to say so I just told her the truth.

""Fortune favors the bold and baby, maybe she'll favor me tonight,""

I matched her grin, feeling lightheaded and my heart racing a thousand miles a minute but never feeling more sure of what I needed to do in this moment with this mysterious vixen.

""Does lady fortune have a name?""

""Illa. And what about you, crazy?""

""Archer. Nice to meet you Illa,""

I took her hand holding my wrist into my own hand and softly kissed it, getting another whiff of her fresh rose fragrance, before letting go and meeting her eyes again.

""You want a drink?""

I offered before thinking about it for a few seconds, considering how different she was from the usual group of women that visited the bar.

""Or maybe you want to get out of here and have a bite or something?""

""Well I was thinking about having a drink or two but having a bite sounds nice too,""

Her voice was actually mellifluous, velvet smooth and calming unlike other women whose voice betrayed their appearance. Sometimes catastrophically. Not that I minded or really cared for, but it was another good thing to add for this almost surreal dream like moment. I almost had this inane worry that if she pinched me I would wake up in the alley outside the bar, hungover. And as if she had read my mind, she glided her hand up my arm slowly before pinching my tricep.

""Day dreaming isn't going to land me in your bed tonight,""

My grin became wolfish and I felt something foreign bloom in my heart but not immediately recognizing it in the heat of the moment, as I slid my arm around her down and cupped her ass firmly. Not too thick which was good enough for me and that did make her cheeks flush like roses as she giggled and swatted at my hand.

""I know a good place. Just for a casual bite. Nothing too fancy though,""

""Good enough,""

I held her lovely green gaze for a moment, wanting to push my paper thin luck and kiss her, just briefly, but not daring to have the balls to as I wrapped my arm back around her and led her out of the bar and to my car.

I would have my chance later.

Later, as we sat together in the booth of the diner with coffee in hands and some light sandwiches, I was silently thanking God for the serendipity of meeting Illa as we ate.

""Told you this was a good place,"" I said as I carefully dabbed at my mouth with a napkin,"" Good prices, convenient hours, no rats running amok all over, and best of all, actual good food,""

""How'd you find this little slice of heaven?"" She asked softly as looked at me.

""Oh, you know, you get bored enough you'll do anything to stave it off and for me it was driving around, looking for anything interesting. And when I surprisingly couldn't find it at all in this badland of a city, I needed to rest and so I found this,"" I waved my hand around the place,"" Which i'm pretty grateful for mind you. I got to know some of the regulars here like Sally over there,"" I motioned to her waiting a table of some nice people,"" She's been here fifteen years if you can believe it. Doesn't mind it at all. She's always happy to see Arnold over there in the corner. He doesn't say much but he's always been convivial with her and treated her nice,""

""How long have you been coming here?"" Illa asked with curiosity, as she brushed back a loose strand of her long raven hair from her face.

""Two weeks,""

""And you know these people pretty well in two weeks?"" She asked incredulously with a hint of skepticism on her face.

""Hard to believe, huh? But it doesn't take me long to know someone. Especially with a good looking face like mine,"" I smiled confidently as I placed my hand over hers.

""Bold and confident,"" Illa softly laughed as she turned her hand palm up to hold mine,"" You're right. This is a good place. Almost makes me believe in the American Dream,""

I smirked like how she had smirked when she first saw me.

""Oh after tonight, i'll make you a full fledged believer in it,""

She smirked back.

""I don't know...I have doubts,"" She challenged me.

""That's okay,"" I said cooly, before pulling her against me and whispering in her ear,"" When I have you pinned under me in my bed tonight, we'll see about those doubts,""

Illa nuzzled her head against mine softly and didn't say anything for a moment. I pinched her arm.

""Day dreaming isn't going to make me go away,"" I grinned wolfishly against her warm cheek.

""I hope not,"" She murmured softly, almost lower than a whisper.

My grin faltered as I caught the change in mood with her. I rubbed her side reassuringly.

""Hey now, don't go falling in love now,"" I teased with a soft smile.

But truth be told, that foreign bloom in my heart hadn't went away at all and I was dreading to recognize what it was; Dreading it because if I didn't see her again after tonight I think I would go mad with an endless ache and loneliness I would feel until I met her again. Oh God, take your own advice.

Her somber expression softened into a smirk before she looked at me and that smirk bloomed into a genuine smile and I felt something confirming that foreign bloom.

Well fuck, I thought helplessly to myself.

""You know, I don't think i'll ever meet anyone like you. I know how fucking crazy that sounds. What, we met only hours ago?"" She laughed incredulously,"" But honestly, to be completely honest with you Archer, I just have this feeling that no one else has ever given me,""

I wanted to offer a joke but seeing at how her sage green eyes truly met mine, like I was someone more than just an easy fuck, more than a partner, I dare say, it just hit me like a crystal bullet of clarity. I didn't want to believe it, what if this is just emotion talking? What if this is just for this night only? I never once felt anything like this, what I felt with Illa, with all the woman I had slept with or met. Why now? Was God truly sending me a sign to change my ways?

Fuck it. Take the chance. If you regret it, you'll live and life will move on. But if it is what you hope it is...then.

I cupped her warm cheek with one hand and then leaned into her to tenderly touch my lips against her soft, supple lips with a kind of love I didn't know I was capable of and let it linger as I felt her hands cup my cheeks as she returned the kiss with her own passion.

And when it was over, I pulled back enough to look in those lovely sage green eyes to see life in them, more than when I had pulled her against me. I felt my heart racing a thousand miles a minute, my face warm and I know was flushed.

""You're not crazy,"" my confident voice coming out barely more than whisper,"" Maybe I am but not you,""

She laughed softly before wrapping her arms tight around my neck and in return I wrapped my powerful arms tight around her waist and pulled her close against me, nuzzling my head against hers lovingly before almost laughing as I heard Sally say softly in the background to someone, probably Arnold:

""That's why i'll never leave here. You'll always find the best people in a dinner. Even if they are a little sleazy,""",1,1750812300.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

I don't know how to handle it.","My friend R and I (both 25F) have been close friends since age 19, but our friendship has become really emotionally exhausting for me post college and I’m not sure what to do, and it’s taken a kind of reverse turn recently.

She has gotten way too comfortable making judgemental comments, giving random advice, and refuting literally everything I say about anything at all. Since college, she has heavily implied on multiple occasions that she views herself as “doing better in life” than myself. For context on our lives, R is married and a homeowner. 

I’m single and not seeking a relationship, but have had long-term relationships in the past. I live with a roomie in the city, and while I could afford to live alone a little further out, for my own mental health I prefer to be in a very walkable area.

When it comes to housing, R is constantly talking about how nice it is to not be wasting money on rent, how she’s so lucky to have her husband and not a “random person” in her house. How it’s so nice to live somewhere “quiet and safe.”

When it comes to dating, she is constantly giving me random advice that I do not ask for (again I’m not in the dating scene so it’s needless, plus if I were, I would never ask her for advice).  Further context, her and her husband got married within a year and he was her first relationship ever. I’ve been in two long-term, happy relationships that both ended amicably. She seems to have forgotten about those, because she’s called me a “late bloomer” and keeps explaining to me all the things that I’ll “learn one day when \[I\] get into a relationship.” I think her marriage is very sweet, but she’s just not someone I’d go to if I ever were to want dating advice.

She is just constantly giving me tons of unsolicited advic**e** about literally everything, coupled with a lot of weird remarks that are made out as “jokes” but at my expense. She refutes or re-explains **literally everything** I say. Every story I share, she explains why I acted wrong and what I should’ve done/what she would’ve done. R is CONSTANTLY correcting me, making jokes, lecturing me about everything. My travel decisions/itineraries are wrong, the wine I ordered with dinner is wrong, the way I take my coffee is wrong, the way I handled a work situation is wrong, the color of my new sweater is wrong, my workout routine is wrong, my dietary choices are wrong, the grocery store I go to is wrong, etc. And it’s all done in a “joking” way, but it’s just rude. Also important to note that she does this with our entire friend circle, but she does it with me the most because I am the closest with her.

Anyway she’s been venting to me recently about how lonely she feels in her neighborhood because there isn’t anyone else in their 20s living there. I try to be supportive, but this is the life she’s been bragging about and acting superior for choosing.

I feel so drained and disrespected, but it’s difficult to fathom throwing the friendship away entirely; it was *such* a great friendship all throughout college and she never acted like this at all until post-grad. I find myself holding onto hope that this is just a phase for her, because I miss her and I miss the way our friendship used to be. I do suspect it may be a phase that will taper off in a few years when the whole marriage & homeowner things are no longer fresh and rare for our age.

She and I are best friends and we inevitably ended up trauma bonded. i truly am in love with her though.

we have a house together, we have 3 beautiful dogs, no kids but our dogs are like kids to us. 

i have BPD(Borderline Personality Disorder) that was diagnosed 2 months ago now. but i have had it the whole relationship. i initially thought i was bipolar 2. but now it all makes sense.

i am making this post because i have completely lost everything in the span of this year. this has been the worst year of my life. and it is all my fault. 

me and her have had our ups and downs, but i never TRULY knew what i put her through until now, because i am genuinely getting the help i need and have needed.

i have truly been verbally abusive to her, whether intentionally or not I DID IT and i hate that. i have said things that we're never truly what i meant to say, but were said regardless. i had also been a lazy piece of crap. i would stay in bed until 2pm. work at 3pm. get home at 11pm. go on the game and play it. i got fat, never took care of myself, and never put my wife first. something i deeply regret and genuinely don't believe was me. i look back and hate that person. she would being me breakfast in bed, dinner in bed, drinks, and i just would be so angry and unapproachable. i threw my issues onto her. she was my emotional punching bad for FAR TOO LONG.

truthfully i would still be this person to this day if she never put herself first. long story short she found someone else earlier this year. i don't blame her. i hurt, but who wouldn't. but i don't blame her. 

she started to feel for this person and was obtaining from them what i failed to provide myself. i found out and i finally had an eye opening understanding that i was LOSING MY LIFE. LOSING MY WIFE. 

i can't help but have hope because i came from nothing and have built a foundation with my wife i never wanna lose. i just never took the initiative and i allowed my mental issues get in the way of how it was affecting her every day. my insane mind thought i was a good person but it ended in disaster and aggression to her verbally that i never will be able to take back. 

i was not me. i am taking accountability and i am to blame. but it was not me. me now. i am changed. i have several ways to help when my rapid mood swings come and i am actively doing better every day to be the person i should have been. 

we are only 23 but we are also already 23. i know she has been through alot, and i have too overall. we just never put ourselves first. and our marriage first. we just survived i think.

she and i are best friends. and i want this to be better, and i want to salvage this marriage because this is my family and life. i genuinely don't want to start anew. not because of anything other than the fact this is what i have always wanted, and she is the person i always needed.

i want to get her back. i have been waking up at 11am, which is early for us as we work 2nd shift hours, i have been bringing her coffee in bed, i have been cleaning the house in the mornings, and i have been doing what a normal husband does. we got the front porch cleaned off for the first time since we bought the house, so we can sit on it now. i cut bushes and grass that needed it. essentially i caught us all up on daily life things other than gutters which i have plans to do Saturday. after that we are all caught up on what i neglected. i have a weekly schedule of housework now and i am just finally feeling like an adult. I hate it took this long to be here but i am now. i am doing the normal things i am supposed to do, but what can i do past that to further show i am better? thats what i am needing to get advice on as i worry i will do too much or overwhelm her.

I guess this entire post is ending with this. has anyone every had a similar situation, on either side of the story, and what are some tips, or ways, to either help her feel more trusting to see i genuinely am a changed person, or what are ways i can go about giving her the space from this marriage, while also being there to show her i didn't just leave her.

It is hurting me mentally more than i ever have been hurt seeing her and being with her every day, but knowing we aren't 100% in this marriage or in a relationship. i am willing to be hurt as i put her through way worse and who am i to complain, but in the long run i just am unsure where to go from here. i want my marriage back and i want to do ANYTHING I CAN AT ALL to have another chance at life with her. 

i hate myself daily that this has happened and i genuinely just need true advice or anything helpful

TL;DR - me and wife are not together 100% right now due to my BPD issues hurting her and pushing her to her breaking point, i am actively being a becoming a better person day by day and i am very optimistic in the future and i want to help her in any way whether it's towards being together again or helping her navigate without marriage. looking for advice",1,1750811882.0,marriageadvice,1,1.0,False
1ljrwyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/askapastor/comments/1ljrwyn/i_need_clarity_on_my_feelings_after_a_recent/,I need clarity on my feelings after a recent discussion with my youth pastor,"This is a long one, TLDR at the end.

  
**Context:**  
I’m involved in youth ministry at my church and recently had a tough conversation with the youth pastor and our pastor about my role and how we’re working together. There have been some ongoing tensions around communication, deadlines, and leadership expectations, so I want to share my perspective on how the conversation went and what I’m feeling. 

So, the conversation started with me mentioning other people involved in youth ministry, but the youth pastor told me not to bring others into it since they weren’t there and hadn’t given consent to talk about how they felt. That caught me off guard, and I felt unprepared after that.

We then talked about some screenshots of messages the youth pastor accidentally sent me saying that she was upset and annoyed that I couldn't make any deadlines, which I had seen. She apologised for sending them, but I felt that her claim I’d missed deadlines was exaggerated. She said it was factual and that if I had communicated better, it might have seemed exaggerated but wasn’t. I admitted I forgot to post on time, the deadline was the 8th, but I posted on the 9th. I explained that I had a job interview and was also working on the church A/V system rebuild at the time, which she said she didn’t know about because I hadn’t told her. I agreed that I could have communicated better.

The conversation then turned to how I feel anxious talking to her. We couldn’t exactly pinpoint when that anxiety started. I suggested it might be because I felt judged or talked about behind my back, which got worse after the accidental messages. I also said it could be because I feel like I have to make everything perfect for her, but she said that was my assumption and not something she ever asked for. She said better communication from me could have cleared that up.

We talked about me feeling micromanaged. She explained that as the youth pastor, all accountability ultimately lands on her. I shared that when a message went out saying youth team leaders would direct youth night and delegate tasks, my team and I felt undermined because we had already sent out volunteer requests. She said that was a mistake on our part since the event plan had only been shared with the media team and not the wider youth leaders yet. I assumed we were following that timeline, but I was wrong. She also said she felt blindsided because I hadn’t told her about a reel I made that was in the plan. I admitted forgetting about the reel but said the alternatives I suggested were just in the moment after realizing I’d duplicated her idea. She felt those alternatives were pre-planned and not communicated, which wasn’t true.

When the pastor suggested we discuss next steps, the youth pastor said she finds it very difficult to communicate with me because I come across as defensive. I apologized and said that’s not how I want to be perceived and that I do take feedback seriously. But she said that if she can’t communicate with me, she doesn’t see how I can continue in this role, and that I’m the only person she struggles to give feedback to. I disagreed - I think I’m open to feedback and only push back when I genuinely feel it’s unfair.

After the youth pastor left, I had a chat with her husband and the pastor over coffee. We agreed the main issue was that I had misunderstood my role. I saw myself as leading the youth ministry, but they saw me as part of a delegated sub-team within the larger ministry. He said this had been communicated but maybe should have been reiterated more clearly. They said they want to pray about next steps, especially after I shared that youth ministry is my calling. I explained my passion for youth and my vision to grow into leadership as a youth pastor one day. They said they’d take that on board.

I just feel a lot of blame was shifted to me and they reacted defensively when all I wanted to do was have a constructive conversation by providing them feedback and seek clarity so I could improve as a leader under their leadership, but now I feel instead I've put my role in jeopardy. 

What did I do wrong? What could've I done better? Did the youth pastor react appropiately?

**TL;DR:**  
I had a tense conversation with the youth pastor and pastor about missed deadlines, communication, and leadership roles. I feel anxious and sometimes micromanaged, partly because I misunderstood my role as a leader rather than a delegated team member. Now because of the conversation, my leadership role is in jeopardy and I don't understand why. ",1,1750811860.0,askapastor,2,1.0,False

1ljrv7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Procrastinationism/comments/1ljrv7k/how_i_went_from_a_procrastinator_to_actually/,"How I went from a ""procrastinator"" to actually getting shit done (6 months of trial & error)","spent the first half of 2024 thinking i was productive bc i had color-coded calendars and 47 different apps. turns out being ""busy"" and getting important stuff done are completely different things. finally cracked the code and actually get meaningful work done now. here's what actually moved the needle:

the foundation stuff (boring but essential):

* started planning only 3 things per day instead of 15. sounds too simple but ur brain can only handle so much decision-making before it taps out
* bought a physical timer (not phone timer). something about the ticking keeps me honest. work for 90 mins, break for 15. repeat
* moved my phone to another room during work blocks. ""airplane mode"" is for weaklings, physical distance is the only thing that works
* started doing weekly reviews every sunday. 20 mins to figure out what worked, what didn't, and what to focus on next week

the energy management stuff:

* tracked my energy levels every hour for 2 weeks like some kind of data nerd. turns out i'm sharp 9-11am and 2-4pm, braindead after 6pm. now i schedule hard work during those windows
* switched from trying to ""power through"" low energy to doing admin stuff instead. email, organizing, planning - save the brain work for when ur brain actually works
* started eating lunch away from my desk. sounds dumb but coming back feels like starting fresh instead of continuing the same energy drain
* got blackout curtains + wake up light. sleep quality went from garbage to actually restorative

the weird psychology hacks:

* started keeping a ""done list"" alongside my to-do list. at the end of each day i write down everything i accomplished. brain needs to see progress to stay motivated
* made a ""time cost"" spreadsheet. netflix = $0 but costs 2 hours. going to gym = $20 but saves 2 hours of feeling like trash. helps me make better decisions
* started batch processing similar tasks. all emails at once, all calls at once, all creative work at once. context switching is productivity cancer
* created ""implementation intentions"" - instead of ""i'll work out"" its ""when i finish my morning coffee, i'll change into gym clothes"". specificity = action

the environment stuff:

* cleaned my workspace completely. not just organized - actually clean. dirty space = cluttered brain (apparently)
* got a separate computer/account just for work. no reddit, no youtube, no random bookmarks. just work stuff
* started using website blockers during work hours. not during breaks, just during actual work time. helps with the ""just one quick check"" impulse
* bought a good chair and monitor setup. being uncomfortable kills productivity faster than anything else

the counterintuitive stuff:

* stopped trying to eliminate all distractions and started scheduling them instead. 15 mins of reddit at 11am, 15 mins at 3pm. brain stops craving it when it knows it's coming
* started saying no to 80% of requests/meetings/opportunities. focus = doing fewer things better, not more things worse
* began treating energy like money - budget it, don't waste it, invest it wisely. some days i ""spend"" energy on work, other days on relationships or health
* learned the difference between ""urgent"" and ""important"". urgent feels stressful, important actually matters. most urgent stuff can wait

the mindset shifts that actually stuck:

* productivity isn't about grinding harder, it's about removing friction from the things that matter
* motivation is unreliable, systems are everything. build processes that work even when u don't feel like it
* perfectionism is just procrastination wearing a suit. ""good enough"" shipped beats ""perfect"" in draft mode
* comparison is productivity poison. focus on ur own progress, not what other people are doing

results after 6 months: i work fewer hours but get more meaningful stuff done. actually have time for friends, hobbies, and not feeling like a stressed robot. turns out the secret wasn't doing more - it was doing the right things consistently.

1ljrooh,https://www.reddit.com/r/frisco/comments/1ljrooh/this_cowboy_has_come_to_appreciate_indian/,This Cowboy has come to appreciate Indian neighbors,"I never figured Frisco, Texas would feel small—what with its glass-paneled corporate parks and Chipotle-by-the-dozen—but my street on Pepperdine Trail sure did. One side: my red-brick ranch house plus a gleaming black F-350 Super Duty the size of a starter home. The other: a new build with bright marigolds lining the porch and a mailbox painted—of all things—turquoise. The real-estate flyer had told me “Singh family, IT professionals,” but the first afternoon I saw them, I just thought: foreigners.

First impressions

They moved in during August heat that hit like a cast-iron skillet. I was nursing a sweet tea when a guy about my age, wearing cargo shorts and a pressed polo, waved. “Hi, I’m Arjun,” he said, accent crisp but not thick. His wife Priya balanced a tray of samosas for the other neighbors; their twins, Rohan and Neha, chased each other with sidewalk chalk.

“Howdy,” I grunted. Didn’t take the samosa. Didn’t offer my name. In my circles we call that being a “real peach.” Truth is, I was wary of anything — or anyone — that didn’t holler yee-haw at the Fourth of July parade.

Trouble brews

My buddies down at the Rusty Spur applauded the wariness. “Watch they don’t curry up the HOA with weird smells,” Hank snickered. I laughed louder than I should’ve. Next week, I caught myself muttering under my breath when Priya burned incense on the porch.

Then September rolled in like a wrecking ball. Dad’s heart attack was first; Mom’s stroke followed three weeks later. Two funerals in a month will gut a man faster than a rattlesnake bite. House fell silent, fridge empty, mail piled.

Knocking on my door

One Sunday, the doorbell rang. I opened it to find Rohan holding a foil-covered casserole. Arjun stood behind him.

“Chicken biryani,” he said. “Spicy—we toned it down.” He looked at the black armband I still wore. “We heard about your parents. We’re sorry.”

Words snagged in my throat. I gestured them in. Over paper plates, Arjun asked about Dad’s ranching days; Priya complimented Mom’s quilting, which she’d seen through my front window. They listened—really listened—while I talked about hospital alarms and inherited loneliness. No judgment, no hurry. Just neighbors.

Community in motion

The kindness snowballed. Neha watered Mom’s roses. Priya sent WhatsApp recipes (she installed the app on my phone herself). Arjun drove me to the social-security office in his Tesla Model Y, classic country music playing because he Googled “George Strait best hits” the night before.

At first I chalked it up to polite hospitality. But when Rohan showed up with a hickory-smoked brisket he’d attempted for a Boy Scouts badge—“So you don’t forget Texas flavors,” he said—I realized this was friendship. Real McCoy, no strings.

My own blinders

One Friday, I mowed their lawn while they were at temple; left no note. Arjun caught me anyway, waving a thank-you from the steering wheel.

“Figured you IT folks mightn’t own a proper mower,” I joked. He laughed, replying, “We do-but yours stripes nicer.” No sting, no defensive snap. That’s when it hit me: every stereotype I’d lobbed their way was a mirror reflecting my ignorance. Dad used to say a cowboy’s word is his brand; what brand had I ironed onto myself?

A lesson in lanes

In March the twins turned sixteen, learner permits hot off the DMV press. Arjun asked if I’d teach them parallel parking—he’d seen me back the F-350 into the tight driveway like threading a needle. I swallowed the irony — me, the guy who once mocked their “foreign” ways, now guiding their rite of passage—and said yes.

We spent weekends at the Dr Pepper Ballpark lot. I’d holler, “Ease off, feather that brake!” They’d giggle at my cowboy hat sliding down my brow. Priya packed masala chai in thermoses; I discovered it beats gas-station coffee by a Texas mile.

The sticker

When Neha finally nailed a perfect reverse-park, she slapped a neon yellow “STUDENT DRIVER” magnet on the truck’s tailgate. Arjun grinned, “Leave it there, Bill. Reminder that we’re all learners.” I nodded, tears stinging behind my wraparound shades.

That evening I cruised Main Street, hat tipped back, Bollywood power-ballad on the radio. Folks stared at the sticker on the beastly F-350, and I felt…light. As if I’d traded a ten-gallon load of prejudice for a pocket-sized pass to humanity.

Epilogue

Neighbors still gossip about our “East-West rodeo potlucks” where brisket meets paneer tikka and everyone debates Cowboys vs. cricket. Me? I’m just the guy who learned the world’s bigger than a spur and a pickup.

The magnet stays on. Because every time I hitch the trailer, I remember: there’s no shame in letting folks show you the ropes—whether that’s grief, saffron rice, or parallel parking.

• Even though we live in a world that may not be optimal for peace and healing, there are still small moments and ways your soul cultivate these things, even if just for a moment*

• You deserve to be cared for: to eat nourishing food, drink enough water, get good sleep, move your body, speak kindly to your mind. Even if it’s hard, even if you don’t want to — I find it helpful to think of myself as a child I’m babysitting or a grieving friend I’ve taken in

So here I am, dipping my toes into the world of Reddit romance. A close friend of mine found someone amazing here—and after much overthinking and anxiety, I figured I’d give it a shot too.

I’m a 30-year-old, plus-sized Indian woman based in Toronto. I’m a non-smoker, teetotaler, and a vegetarian by both habit and heart. I’d love to be with someone who aligns with these values as it’s a lifestyle thing, not just a preference.

I’m looking for a serious, emotionally grounded relationship. Thanks to my previous mutually clingy-obsessive relationships, nonchalance or mind games do not really excite me. Also, if you’re exploring open relationships, polyamory, or mostly interested in just the physical aspects, this isn’t the right post for you (and that’s okay too, just not my lane).

I moved to Toronto from India two years ago, and one of the biggest realizations I’ve had is that platonic love, while beautiful, isn’t always enough to carry you through in a place as cold (literally and emotionally) as Toronto. The stress of adjusting to a new country, new routines, and a new life made me deeply miss how comforting it was to have someone to love and to be loved by in return. Not just companionship, but a connection that grounds you when everything else feels unfamiliar.

I’ve always had slow-burn friendships that evolved into deep relationships. So this whole “casual dating, swipe-right-performative-banter” scene is a bit alien to me. I don’t know how to perform to impress. I believe when it’s the right person, it just… clicks. No theatrics needed. I don’t have the energy or desire for anything superficial. Blame my introverted nature. Even writing this post and putting it out there is an anxiety riddled task for me. 

What I’m truly seeking is a relationship with someone I can even enjoy life’s beautiful mundanity with: the grocery runs, the Sunday naps, the random movie marathons, the silly debates about which café has the best coffee. I believe the true test of any relationship is how comfortable you are in each other’s presence while doing nothing in particular.

What makes my heart happy?
•Concerts that make me feel alive
•Stand-up comedy shows
•Movie nights curled up in hoodies
•Exploring cute little cafés and pretending I’m a character in a feel-good indie film

1ljrkcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1ljrkcq/final_sibo_post_fully_recovered/,Final SIBO Post (fully recovered),"**This is the last (and maybe most important) post I'm going to write about SIBO.** 

There's no TLDR, and I'm not going to dive deep on what it was like (previous posts will showcase the misery that was living with SIBO every day). 

Started in 2019, and was $10K+ and 3+ years of living hell (couldn't digest food), but if I had to start over I'd know exactly what to do. 

I found some herbs that worked really well for the short-term, I came across *Seed* which is a freaking amazing product, but a while back (maybe a few months now) I decided to stop taking that too. My digestion went from great to great. 

As a ""healed"" person, I'm going to share my final thoughts on SIBO. 

DISCLAIMER - I know someone's going to chime in with ""*this is stupid""* or something along those lines. Look, I'm just someone who lives without symptoms and eats what they want to eat, when they want to eat it (have been known to enjoy the odd cinnamon bun or hazelnut gelato, but for the most part I stick to a clean vegan diet, fast 18:6 with the odd prolonged fast). I can only share my experience. If you're unwell, and you hate this post, then just keep being unwell and we can go our separate ways. I gain nothing from writing this. 

**Healing at the root**. 

SIBO is *not* the problem, it's the symptom of the real problem. Western medicine will focus on the symptom, because that means you're going to be a paying customer (subscriber) for longer. If you want to heal for good this time, you have to get to the root of the problem. 

**Trauma and Incoherent Information** 

I recently spent a week at Dr Joe Dispenza's week-long advanced retreat in Mexico. There were some amazing studies and incredible data on what takes place in the microbiome after 7 days. He said ""of course the microbiome is going to be different, because the person is different"". 

When the body has a traumatic experience, it stores it in the ""please never let this happen again"". Enough of these, and the body becomes conditioned to stay on high alert mode, in an attempt to protect itself from experiencing the trauma again. 

My ""symptoms"" were at their worst when I was broke, running a brand new business with no idea what I was doing, with a 6 month old daughter, in a marriage that was crumbling, trying to figure it all out. Not a lot of time for rest, digestion and repair. 

If the nervous system is saying ""run, fight or hide from this dangerous situation"", do you think it's going to block off time for digestion and healing? Of course not. Too much danger in the short-term. 

Then the MMC stops working properly, along with your entire digestive tract, and of course bacteria isn't going to be swept properly through the intestinal tract. Bacteria begin to multiply and of course you will end up with a bunch of them in the wrong place. 

Trauma is incoherent information stored in the body. In the east they talk about chakras (Sanskrit for ""wheel"" / energy centers and the 7 primary ones that run from the base of the spine to the crown / pituitary gland. 

As Bessel van der Kolk explains in *The Body Keeps the Score*, information literally gets ""stuck"" in the body following a traumatic experience that sent the body into a sympathetic response. 

Practice reliving the experience often enough, and you can activate the sympathetic reaction by thought alone with zero effort (living on autopilot). 

If you can liberate the stored emotions and energy stuck in the body, you can stop doing all of the surface-level stuff like antimicrobial protocols, Rifaximin (worst experience of my life), going to the naturopath, avoiding FODMAP's, avoiding restaurants etc. 

Lastly, if you're scared of eating ""trigger foods"" (I've lived when everything is a trigger food, and when nothing is a trigger food; the second one is better), every time you eat you are panicking below the surface that you're going to have to ""pay for it"". You check where the closest bathroom is, you start hyperventilating, your nervous system is not in a place to digest food and then you wonder why you're having a ""flare up"" 

**Getting the Body Back Online** 

I do not take anything for my digestion. I drink coffee on an empty stomach every morning (sometimes more than I was planning). I have one solid movement in the morning (unless it's cherry season, then we could allow for 2). I wake up with energy, I sleep 7+ hours through the night, and I eat whatever FODMAP's I damn well feel like. 

This is what life is like when your body is in balance. Living in a state of incoherence, the body never has a chance to come into balance or alignment. There are *so many ways* to activate the parasympathetic response and start bringing the body back online, but here is the key:

*Chronic* *conditions always require a lifestyle and identity change.* 

You can't keep living as the unhealed person who obsessively looks for answers outside of you. Our bodies are amazing, they're not meant to be set off like a volcano every time we eat an apple or an avocado. 

I'm going to leave a list of resources, books, daily practices that I use or have used as major stepping stones in my healing journey. Living as the healed individual is so much more enjoyable, even if it means you have to face some hard shit or stop doing what you've been doing every day. 

**The last thing I will mention here is ""the breath"".** 

There is a breath that I've practiced for a couple years after reading the book *Becoming Supernatural*, but I felt like I ""mastered"" it across the 7 day event. 

For the record, it's not something I'd dive into with zero experience as it could trigger some not-so-nice experiences if you've been living with these stored traumas for years or decades. Take it slow. 

There is a dormant energy at the base of the spine (Kundalini) which, once activated, will make its way past all of these ""wheels"" and eventually into the brain. It is a life force that is not to be dabbled with, and it's also a gateway to living as the creator and not as the victim. 

Why I'm telling you this - you don't have to ""know"" what all your traumas were. In fact, I'd rather you just did way with them and got on with your life. This breath, when done properly, will drive that energy upwards and transmute that stored information back into what it started as (pure energy). 

As I mentioned, do not just dive straight into this but rather start by reading the book and bringing the energy centers into balance before attempting.

**Resources** **/ Practices (ZERO AFFILIATE LINKS SO DONT EVEN GO THERE):**

1. **EFT Tapping -** I would start with ""The Science Behind Tapping"" and then find a really good practitioner in your area or online 

2. **Cold Therapy -** I would read ""The Wim Hof Method"" and *actually practice what it teaches*. Cold water is nature's wonderful anti-inflammatory, I still swear by cold showers and ice baths every day. 

3. **The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk -** Amazing book about how trauma stores itself in the body and how time absolutely does not ""heal everything"" 

4. **Exercise -** Do it every day

5. **Joe Dispenza Resources -** I would start with Breaking the Habit or Becoming Supernatural, and would highly suggest either an in-person event or the Progressive Workshop 

6. **Seed Probiotic -** This was huge for me in bringing the microbiome back into balance 

7. **Fasting -** 18:6 or 20:4 every single day. Give the digestive tract time to heal and come back online. 

8. **Breathwork -** 9D Breathwork is a beautiful journey, but Breathe with Sandy on YouTube is a great place to start. Gateway to stored emotions.

9. **You Can Heal Your Life by Louise Hay -** Beautiful outlook on how we create dis-ease in the body 

10. **Meditation -** Whether it's Dr Joe or other, I dedicate 1-2+ hours of my day to these practices for a reason

11. **EMDR -** Find a local practitioner or start with [www.virtualemdr.com](http://www.virtualemdr.com)

A customer brought in his **BMW Z3 that he’s owned for 16 years**. The car is garage-kept, driven only in summer, and still in amazing shape. But the original black paint was starting to show its age  so he wanted to give the car a new, cleaner, lighter look.

# [Wrap Color](https://www.autostyleppf.com/wrap) & Choice:

We landed on [3M's Beige White Gold](https://www.autostyleppf.com/wrap), a soft champagne tone that hits perfectly under sunlight. He was considering a full respray in BMW White or a light bluish tone, but ultimately decided on a wrap instead  easier, faster, and more reversible.

What’s cool is how well it matches his **grey wheels** and gives the Z3 a completely new vibe. More elegant than flashy. Feels like something you'd see at a collector meet or Sunday coffee gathering.

# Pricing:

We quoted him **$4,000 for the full wrap** using high-end 3M vinyl. Another shop quoted him between **$6,500 and $7,000** for the same job 😳  so he was super happy with the result and value.

# Why Wrap Over Paint?

He was originally thinking about a full paint job  but as many of you know, a decent respray in a new color can easily cost **$10K+**, especially if you want the door jambs, edges, and quality work.  
Instead, we gave him 5 big reasons to go with a [vinyl wrap](https://www.autostyleppf.com/services)

:

1. **Restore the car’s look** without spending $10K on paint
2. **Protect the original paint** from rock chips and sun fading
3. **Unique color** that stands out at local shows like Iron Gate Motor Condos in Naperville
4. **Easy to remove or switch** in 3–5 years if he wants a new look
5. **Adds care and resale appeal** without permanent changes

# About the Car:

Quick throwback  the [BMW Z3](https://www.autostyleppf.com/)

 was BMW's first modern roadster, debuted in the mid-90s. If you’re old-school you probably remember it from *Golden Eye*. Small, RWD, and still a blast to drive. Not super common these days, so cool to see one in this shape and getting some cosmetic love.

If anyone wants to see pics, I’ll post them soon  or check out our IG u/AutoStylePPF.

Let me know what you think of the color choice. Too subtle? Just right?",1,1750810825.0,u_Ok-Discount-855,0,1.0,False

I just wanted to do a fun silly job that wasn't too serious and a clinical job for the pce hours. The clinical job is meh, it's just a tech job and it's boring but I need the money. The other job is a research job at a huge institution, and it was supposed to be per diem and my ""fun"" job. They told me 12 hours/week (1 shift). No big deal, seemed easy enough.

It's supposed to be a research position, but now they're forcing it to be like a substitute position as if the others in my role are superior to me and the other new person and we're just backups, even if the PI himself said he really wanted me at the lab & wants me to get publications and experience with the whole research process. And I just got an email today saying that I have to have 1 shift per week at any time they need + 2 ""on-call"" shifts (they didn't tell me this and it's 2.5 hours away from where I live both ways. And it costs \~$22 per trip to and from the research facility). This whole time they've been saying that they're willing to work with my schedule for my other job (that's 2-3x per week) and that it's not a huge commitment and it won't be more than 1 assigned shift (and I've told them I prefer days) and maybe 1 call shift every now and then (NOT 2 A WEEK). They also know how far I live and how long it takes to get there (I also spoke to the PI at length about this over the phone, and he was very understanding about it all...it's the research coordinator that's just switching everything up).

The study's cool but is it really worth that much of confusion and just stress? At that point I'd be working \~60 hours/week, which I know isn't a lot considering residency is more. But my goal for my gap year was not to run on 4 hours of sleep a night and stress during peak application season. And the way they've worded it in today's email is that they want the other staff to have breaks and enjoy summer, but that flexibility won't apply for my position (again, per diem and was told 1x/week during the interview process. I also had 5 interviews for this lab).

Help please :) I've already mentioned it in some of my secondaries as a future thing that i've just started experiencing (it's not in my primary thank god) and I genuinely think it's an innovative study that has a lot of potential (and the institute name doesn't hurt). But I'm getting some unique experiences at my other job too without dropping $$$ in my commute and scheduling full-time hours.

  
(ALSO, the jobs I have were the first 2 jobs I applied to for my gap year. I think I'd pretty easily get another per diem/temporary job if I really wanted to. but idk how much flexibility I'll need in terms of interviews, and its uncertain if either of these jobs will allow for that.

Throwing this out there into the universe — maybe it clicks with the right person.

I’m a 25-year-old Indian guy living in New York City. Moved here a couple of years ago, chasing both career goals and that big-city energy, and I’ve been loving the ride so far. Life’s good — I’m working, growing, exploring the city one coffee shop and late-night food spot at a time — but yeah, it’s time to find someone to share it with.

Personality-wise: I’m chill, thoughtful, and someone who values real connection over small talk. Not into the endless swiping — I’d rather get to know someone who’s down-to-earth, curious, and kind. I can hold a conversation for hours or vibe in silence with equal comfort.

Things I’m into:
	•	Food (both eating out and badly trying to recreate recipes at home)
	•	Walks around Central Park or by the river
	•	Watching movies from Bollywood to indie
	•	Weekend getaways when I can
	•	Nerding out on tech stuff
	•	Random deep convos at 1AM about life, the universe, and our favorite childhood snacks

Not here to play games or impress with over-the-top lines. Just a normal guy, looking for a genuine connection — whether it starts with a chat, a coffee, or a shared meme.

If you’re around NYC (or willing to make the effort), and this sounds like your vibe, feel free to say hi. Life’s too short not to take the chance.",1,1750810582.0,u_Ok-Literature9391,0,1.0,False

Hey! I’m Patrick, host of It’s Later Than You Think Podcast. I started this in December of ‘24 kind of on a whim. I had been reading a fiction book and the phrase came up and I couldn’t get it out of my head. Decided it might be a good idea for a podcast and here we are. 

I started off rotating between solo episodes and guests, but not I’ve switched to all guest spots, with possibly bringing back solo episodes at some point. The topic is very broad so I’ve had some good variety. 

My guests have talked about such things as:

1. Running/Fitness
2. Photography
3. Being a musician
4. Foodie accounts (I’m Milwaukee based)
5. Sobriety / Sober Curious
6. Growing gourmet mushrooms 
7. Building a startup (coffee connection)
8. Owning a business 

Some of the solo episodes I did, to give you a better idea:

1. Just let it go 
2. Evolving Priorities
3. Put the Phone Down
4. Discover Your Passions
5. You Can Do Hard Things
6. A Letter to Your Younger Self

Anyway, I record audio only for the podcast,  however I use Riverside and do record both audio/video. I’ve started playing around with an AI clip generator so I sometimes use the video feeds for marketing on my social media. 

Would be happy to have you if you have something unique, fun, or something you’re passionate about.

We rented a house in a small neighbourhood around 10 minutes away from the city centre by car. It's been only about two months since we moved here.

About two weeks ago, as I was leaving my house to go to work I saw the neighbours leaving in their car too. I came back home and their car still wasn't there. I didn't think anything of it, whatever. 
Next morning still, their car wasn't in front of the house. They dont have a backyward or another place, like a garage where they could park, their car is always in front.

Still I literally didn't care I just noticed that they weren't home. The next day after that I didn't have work so in the morning I was sitting outside and drinking my morning coffee when I noticed someone on the neighbours window. I thought someone must have broken into their house since their car wasn't there but I didn't want to rush to immediate assumptions so I pretended to walk down the street in case I see something move again (Sounds stupid I know but that's the only idea I had). 

When I looked at their window I saw two kids and they were waving at me. I haven't seen them much before, maybe 2 or 3 times, but I definitely knew these were the neighbours kids. They opened the window and I asked them if their parents were home but they said the left TWO DAYS AGO. They were asking me if I can open the hallway door in their house so that they could come downstairs. I was absolutely baffled because what do you mean they left two pretty small kids (about 5 or 6yo girl and a little older boy, maybe 8-9yo), in a house all alone for two straight days and on top of that they locked them upstairs. What if there was a fire or literally if anything happened. They didn't even have access to food. 

I immediately called the police and they arrived, they took the kids with them, I told them what I saw and what the kids told me. They contacted the parents and I don't know what happened next. 

Next days I have been yelled at by the neighbours, old people and families who also have kids about the fact that I called the police on them. One old woman told me that I now ""made those kids orphans"" as if I did something to their parents lol. Others have stopped me on the street to tell me how I shouldn't get into other people bussiness and I literally can't believe this. Genuinely do you think this is insane? I don't think this is something that's ""not my bussiness"" or something that should be excused. It's extremely dangerous and I can't believe they are trying to excuse these people.

Beginner here.  I've only started playing golf roughly 2 years ago.  I've played a variety of sports (soccer, volleyball, tennis) before but never delved to golf.  My coworker brought me into this game and my nephew started playing a little bit before I did, so I've got motivation to get into it.  I've only played 3 other rounds and they were all 9-hole rounds.  

Wife is traveling for work so I take some PTO and tag along.  There's a few courses around and today was my first one.

Nine hole muni course.  Mostly par 3 and a few (read: 2) par 4.  I got there a bit late so I didn't really get a chance to warm up.  There were supposed to be 2 others in my tee time but they didn't show up so the started told me I could start.  Figured since it was kind of slow I played 2 balls.  

I'm doing OK until I get to the 5th hole.  128yd par 3 that curves slight to the left.  I grab the 7 iron, tee the ball low, and give it a shot.  

It goes straight towards the green, which is partly obscured by trees.  It makes it out of the trees and lands on the green!

At this point I forget about the 2nd ball and work my way towards the green.  I see the guy from the group in front with his hands on his waist looking at the ball and looking at me before he continues on with his group.  Must be good?

Ball is about a club length away from the hole.

My heart is racing as I grab the putter, assess the green, and putt.  And it goes in!

My problems have always been that I am very sensitive and I get upset quickly. My love language is that I want it like in the movies and I know it’s unrealistic, but it would be a dream scenario. His problems are that he shuts down in conversations and in everyday life he rarely shows the love that I wish for. In our country it is normal to call your partner ""honey"" (translated differently in my language). He has never called me that or anything sweet. He thinks it's cringe. He is bad at giving flowers, buy small gifts - just what I would call general love. 

The beginning of our 20s was the worst. We were really bad at communicating and almost overnight in my mid-20s, I woke up and told myself that I was showing the worst version of myself, because I knew I had a lot of love to offer. I started seeing a psychologist, read a lot about communication, gave him space during arguments and tried to be the best I could. It took years and I'm still not there, but I'm trying.

My boyfriend, on the other hand, hasn’t changed as much as I would like - and as he has promised over the years. He promises in every conversation that he'll try, I just never really get to see it. He sets the agenda for when it's important to talk about different things. If he doesn't want to, well then he doesn't want to and shuts down. He looks into his computer screen when I'm sitting next to him and trying to have a discussion. According to him, I suffer from a 'victim mentality', which has resulted in me talking about my own mistakes in every discussion when I mention his because I'm afraid of appearing like that. His love language is also still the same (i.e.... de nada).

You probably think we should just break up, right? I know, but it's hard when you love someone. He’s my best friend. 

A few weeks ago we had a long and good talk about our relationship. I said that I was at the end of my rope now and that this was now or never - I'm too old for this and I want to start a family on a good foundation. I said what things I wanted him to work on and he said some things he wish I work on. I also told him that I wished he showed more respect and love. I said that I missed him sometimes and wished he would join me on small errands because I miss his company and feel like we only have actual dates. Yes yes he would definitely do that. I even suggested couples therapy and I’m willing to work extra so it doesn’t effect our budget, but no no no he was really insisting that we work on this together.

The other day I asked if he wanted to go for a ride because I needed some air. No, he was tired. I drove myself and left it at that, but I noticed that once again I got a no. I haven't seen the shadow of a flower and I know he's been to several places where they can be bought. I even said that he could pluck some of the flowers from our garden as a nice surprise because some of them would wither within a few days - not a flower in sight and they’re dead. I haven't heard a loving word. I've tried giving him breadcrumbs and saying something cute here and there and when I asked the other day if I was pretty enough because we were going out, that was the only time during these weeks I was told that I was beautiful.

Which brings us to today. I was going out to buy coffee half an hour away (I'm the only one who drinks it) and I asked if he wanted to come along. Nope, he didn't want to. I then politely said that this is the reason I'm not asking anymore. He looks at his computer screen and says that he doesn't want to discuss this and I can't stand a no. When I continue, he says ""I'm not answering you on this anymore because you’re going in circles"". Again, it's a cased closed. That results in me calling him a loser… Saying that he’s a loser who makes promises all the time and makes me feel like nothing. Shame on me. He right away called me a b and something else nasty in our language. Said that I was a drama b who couldn’t take a no for an answer. Then I left.

When I came home I completely broke down in front of him. Told him that I was tired of this and that he couldn’t even look at me when I was talking to him and shutting me down everytime I had something to say. He told me (while he was looking at the screen) that I am completely wrong about it. I couldn't take a no and I am making myself the victim. I am solely to blame for our discussion and it is solely my fault that I was called those things today. I suffer from victim mentality and I put myself on a pedestal. I said again that I called him a loser because I mean it. A loser for never showing he loves me, promising me gold and green forests, but never keeping it. Playing male chauvinist and trying to decide when my feelings are worth listening to. This resulted in him saying that he’s tired of having such b girlfriend and then shutting down completely and stopped responding. Now he has gone to bed and he hasn’t said a single word. 

I know swearing is never nice and should never be said. I know you’re all thinking I should break up with him. But here we are, 10 years later in a house we recently bought because love makes one blind. But I think he deserves to hear what I think of him. He's heard me say ""I really want so and so"" for years and I’ve heard him say he would change. 

I don’t want to be nice anymore, he deserves to hear the truth and I don’t care if we break up over this. I’m done being forgiving. AITAH?",0,1750809813.0,AITAH,16,0.5,False

I listen to several subs, but lately when I have time (or sometimes at bedtime) I listen to subs for studying, strengthening the mind, anyway... but I couldn't see any results, so I researched A LOT of UG subliminals for studies and started listening, that was last week. Tomorrow I have two tests that I NEED to do well on, otherwise I won't earn enough points this quarter, and it gave me an ABSURD desire to study. I got home, just said hi to my parents and made a HUGE cup of coffee. I ate some bread, drank all the coffee and started organizing everything to study. I didn't know where this desire came from, but I knew I really wanted to study. but what happened was, I spent from one o'clock in the afternoon until eight o'clock at night studying, that is, 8 hours studying without stopping. I was focused, I learned everything, literally everything. but this resulted in me being mentally tired now, in pain and only God knows what else I'm feeling... I recommend it to anyone who wants to stop being lazy when it comes to studying, but only listen if you are strong, please. Finally, I got results ",13,1750809740.0,Subliminal,8,1.0,False

*The camp stuck out like a wound upon the land. A rotted set of tent poles, bivouac long since collapsed, a rusted pot. It had almost been consumed by the marsh.

*Sitting on a lichen-crusted rock.*

**Journal of Baptiste M.**

**Yukon River, Western Alaska Winter, 1904**

I don't know if anyone will ever read this. Maybe the snow’ll swallow it, maybe the wind’ll scatter the pages. Or maybe whatever’s out there now, wearing Charlie’s skin like a damp coat, will find it first. But I need to write. Put something between me and the silence. Make a record, for whoever comes after—if anyone does.

My name is Baptiste. Born in Buffalo Narrows, Saskatchewan. My maman was Métis—Cree blood, strong and soft-spoken. My père was French and loud, but never mean. He taught me to trap, hunt, live close to the land. I grew up skinning muskrats with a pocketknife and listening to fiddle tunes by candlelight. I was a child of the prairie, floating through life like logs on the Qu'Appelle river. I left home when I was seventeen, drifted north like smoke from a cabin chimney. I thought I was chasing gold. Maybe I was just chasing quiet.

I came to Alaska by raft, sled, and frozen boot-leather. Bummed rides from trappers, gold panners, ex-confederates looking to escape the long arm of Uncle Sam. I once met a missionary fella, small man, going to proselytize among the peoples of the great heathen North. Traveled the Yukon until the world narrowed to cold air, pine smoke, and the smell of my own wool coat. I liked it that way. No one cared who I was up there. I was just another lost soul hoping to find, or lose, himself under that big white Alaskan sun. Ended up in Eagle late in the season, the only beacon of civilization, if you can even call it that, for miles until that trading settlement up on the Tanana. It was already cold, snow crusting the edges of the trail, dogs breathing steam like little engines. The kind of cold that bites your teeth and settles into your bones like regret. 

I was raised Catholic, like most Métis. I was proud of my God, but the further I came north it seemed he mattered less and less. Eagle was no exception. A small cluster of cabins with a single dirt trail through the center. As I walked into town, passing a few straggling natives hauling tump-lines of pelts to the factor’s house, I saw it. Burned remnants, a single blackened cross the only betrayal of what this charred hulk once was. I turned to a man walking past, an old man, scars on his face and hair poking out from under what looked to be an old army cap. I tried, in French, to ask him why the few inhabitants hadn’t rebuilt God's house. He stared at me like I was from a different world. Then he simply said, “Dieu n’a pas de demeure ici.” God has no home here. 

I was in the post office-slash-supply store—rough-cut logs, frost etching patterns on the windows, woodstove in the corner throwing off more smoke than heat. A tattered flag adorned the wall behind the counter; whether taken as a trophy or displayed out of actual reverence, I couldn’t tell. The few patrons huddled near the woodstove, speaking in a mix of French, Russian, and a multitude of other languages that I couldn’t pinpoint. I sat in the back, nursing a split knuckle from a mishap with the axe and drinking thick coffee that tasted like charred rope. In strode this Gwich’in man. Big shoulders, sharp eyes. Dressed in a caribou hide parka that looked like it had been made by a blind seamstress. His hair was short and black, I couldn’t tell his age. He could’ve been 40, or he could’ve just seen his 19th winter.

He looked around once, eyes flashing to the fire, then to the people conversing like ravens on a carcass. Looked at me. Then walked over and sat across from me like it’d already been decided somewhere upriver.

He didn’t say anything. Just reached out, tapped the knuckles of my bandaged hand, then tapped his chest twice. I figured that meant his name. I said “Baptiste.” He nodded once, just once, like he was filing it away in some drawer in his head. He tapped his chest again. I shrugged. “Charlie,” I said. Figured he needed a name I could pronounce. He never told me different.

After a few more swigs of coffee, Charlie simply stood up and walked out. I assumed I should follow him, follow this man whose face looked like rawhide stretched over stone. He led me out back, past the store's wood supply and to what looked to be a pile of gear under a caribou hide. He looked at me, and his eyes glinted with what I could only assume was pride. It was really the only emotion I could glean from his straight-across grin. He pulled back the hide to reveal a set of snares, a tent with a HBC brand, and a pair of snowshoes. 

I looked at him, wondered what he had done to come into such a fortune. “Where did you get this?” I quizzed him. He only looked at me, eyes hinting at something that I couldn’t see. 

We left Eagle two days later, with the last barge gone and the snow piling deeper.  Headed upriver with two rifles, enough provisions to last a few weeks, and a general enthusiasm for the grand possibility. The sun beat on our backs as we walked, shadows trudging along under us, our only companions except the cold. The cold was constant. The cold was hungry. It was the kind of cold where trees groan in the night and the river talks in its sleep.

We built our camp on a bend in the Yukon where the spruce trees leaned like old men. Good hunting ground. Quiet. Nobody for miles but the ravens. 

Life was good, at first. We worked in rhythm. Wake up to frost on the blankets, breath like smoke in the cold. One of us would stoke the fire while the other boiled snow for water. Breakfast was usually pemmican or bannock, sometimes fresh rabbit or ptarmigan if we were lucky. Charlie made tea with spruce needles. Tasted like biting a tree, but it kept you sharp.

Charlie was certainly curious, multiple times I caught him opening my bible, staring at the lines of ink which I knew meant less than moose tracks through the snow to him. But nevertheless he looked, studied it with the same glint in his eyes as when we first met. 

We trapped in a wide loop down by the oxbow, mostly for fox and hare. Once we caught a lynx, and Charlie let out the first laugh I ever heard from him—a low, surprised sound like he hadn’t remembered he could. I smoked the meat, stretched the pelt. We talked without talking. Gestures. Shared chores. Some days we didn’t speak at all, but it never felt quiet.

The forest was quiet, but not dead. The trees were alive, they groaned and swayed like old women. Tracks of small animals crisscrossed the snow every morning. One morning I awoke to find a set of wolverine tracks that came right to our tent, then retreated back into the snowy wild. 

I’d spend afternoons sharpening my knife with the whetstone my grandfather gave me. Charlie would whittle, dozens of small wooden men began to populate our camp. He would leave them all around, in a rough semicircle around our camp, always facing north. We kept the fire going all day long once the cold settled in—colder than anything I’d known back in Saskatchewan. Even the river sounded different. Groaned and popped like it was alive beneath the ice.

Saw bear tracks once, big ones. Fresh. Too fresh. Charlie squatted down and stared at them a long time. When I asked if it was a grizzly, he just shook his head once, real slow. Didn’t say more.

One morning a moose wandered near the camp, steam rising from its back like smoke from a sweat lodge. We both froze, watching. Charlie raised his rifle and brought it down with one shot to the neck. It kicked twice before it lay still in the snow. Clean. Beautiful. Charlie cut a set of birch poles at the kill site, then lashed them into a travois before he began splitting its belly and peeling its skin back. I helped, the skin ripping away from the flesh like the bark off a birch tree. We chopped the carcass into quarters, leaving the gut pile for the wolves and ravens. We hauled it in together, sweating through our coats. Took all day to cut it proper, hang the meat over a low fire which creaked and popped like the joints of an old man. We thanked the spirit, me in my tongue, him in his. That night we ate like kings, fat sizzling on the fire, grease running down our chins, hands raw from the cold and the knives. 

Sometimes, after supper, we’d sit by the fire and watch the northern lights. They danced across the sky like stories, like ancestors telling secrets. Charlie’d hum low under his breath—something old, something I didn’t know but felt in my bones. I liked those nights. Felt like we were part of something older than the trees.

I started to remember the old stories. The stories I listened to from the loft where my brothers and I slept. Stories told away from the prying ears of the priests and the white men. Stories of the ancestors, the people who brought our people out from the dawnland and fought the old Buffalo-beings. I started to see that here, the Catholic God had no power. I began to pray to something older, something more… natural. This was older than Jesus, Mother Mary, or any of that. 

But then the snow came heavier. Days got shorter. The forest got quieter.

And Charlie started watching the trees too much.

Then, one morning, he didn’t come back.

I figured he’d gone farther than usual, past our unspoken perimeter about four miles out from camp. Maybe tracked something, maybe he saw a bear or wolverine and decided to follow. I waited. Drank half a mug of coffee and left his mug sitting on a flat rock near the fire, steam curling up and vanishing in the cold air. By dusk, the cup was frozen solid. I decided to put on my snowshoes and follow his track through the snow. I followed as far as I could. It simply went straight through the trees, walking with purpose, almost as if he was following something out there. But the snow had started falling by then, slow at first, then harder, until the trail vanished under the storm. 

And the storm didn’t stop. Not that night. Not the next. It screamed.

The wind howled like a dying thing. The trees shook so hard it felt like the earth might snap open and swallow us whole. I burned half our firewood just trying to keep my fingers alive. I ate every last scrap of food that we had. The tent groaned under the weight of snow, and I had to go out multiple times, wrapped in hides and blankets to shovel snow off of it with my snowshoes. I barely slept—just sat up with the rifle across my lap, staring at the shadows like they might blink first.

I kept thinking I heard him. Crunch of snow, a voice in the wind, maybe a knock on the edge of the tent pole. Every time I’d throw open the flap, there’d be nothing but darkness and snow.

Then he came back. Two days later, just after dusk. The snow had just stopped falling, the wind blustering like the death throes of a dying buffalo bull. 

No sound. No warning. Just walked into camp like he’d never left. He was covered in snow but not cold, not shivering. I saw a glimpse of his hand, black with frostbite, before he quickly shoved it into a fold in his coat.  His coat was ripped along the arm, blood crusted along the edge like old rust. He looked at me like he didn’t recognize me—or maybe like I was the one who’d changed.

I said his name. “Charlie.”

He didn’t speak. Didn’t blink. Just stared. His eyes were bloodshot, almost glazed over. I knew he could see me but I felt like he was looking past me, somewhere off into the trees. 

Something had followed him back from that blizzard.Something wearing him like a coat that didn’t fit quite right.

I tried to carry on like nothing was wrong. Chopped wood. Melted snow. Checked the snares. But everything felt *off*, like the world had tilted just a little and never tilted back. It felt like a temporary lull in a winterkill blizzard. Silent, no wind, a peace that eats at your brain until the howling winds are welcome.

Charlie barely ate. Didn’t sleep, far as I could tell. Just sat by the fire at night, still as stone, staring into the flames like they were telling him something. He didn’t hum anymore. He didn’t nod when I spoke his name.

He didn’t blink.

Sometimes I’d wake up in the dark, feel his eyes on me from across the tent. Just… *watching*. One time I pretended to sleep, let my breathing stay slow. He leaned close—so close I could feel his breath on my cheek. It didn’t smell like anything. Not meat, not smoke, not man. Just cold.

I remembered stories then. From when I was little, sitting by my *mémère’s* stove in Buffalo Narrows, the heat crackling and her hands busy with beadwork. She used to tell me things when the wind howled outside, when the dogs whined for no reason and the oil lamp flickered low.

“Baptiste,” she’d whisper, “don’t go out when the lights dance.”

I’d ask why, wide-eyed, chewing bannock too fast.

“Because the *Wîhtiko* hunts in the wind. Because the *napêwak*—the star-people—they call down to you. They don’t always bring you back.”

She told me of men who wandered from camp and came back wrong. Hollowed out. Hungry for more than food. Spirits that waited in snowdrifts and drank from your soul like it was birch sap.

I used to laugh at those stories. Say they were just to scare kids. But now?

Now I wasn’t laughing.

I started keeping my rifle close. Real close. Wouldn’t let Charlie walk behind me anymore. Wouldn’t sleep unless I heard him lie down first. I carved a little charm from birch, like *mémère* taught me—a small face, tongue stuck out, to ward off evil. I strung it around my neck with sinew. It didn’t help.

Then one night—must’ve been close to midnight—I woke up. The fire was low, just coals and shadow. Wind had died down. Eerie kind of stillness, like the woods were holding their breath.

Charlie wasn’t in the tent.

I sat up fast, heart already thudding. Slipped on my boots and coat, grabbed the rifle, and pushed open the flap.

And there he was.

Standing out in the snow.

Naked.

Bare skin glowing blue-white under the northern lights, which were out in full, twisting and writhing across the sky like smoke made of bone. No sound. No breath. Just him, unmoving, looking up.

His body was wrong. Too still. Muscles frozen but not shivering. Snow piled at his feet but didn’t cling to his skin.

And then he turned.

Slow. Like something remembering how to move a human body.

His face—his *face*—was calm. But his eyes.

God help me, his eyes were pits. Not black. Not empty. Just… *gone*. Like someone had scooped out everything inside and left the skin behind. I’ve seen dead bears, seen wolves with their guts torn open, seen eyes clouded with death.

This wasn’t death.

This was older.

This was hunger without a mouth.

He looked at me. And I knew—*knew*—whatever had followed him in from the blizzard hadn’t just followed. It had moved in.

It was *wearing* him.

Kise-Manitow, nîmâkwên.

Namoya wîhtikow, namoya.

Pîkiskwê nôhtê-nîmihito.

Miyo-pimâtisiwin mâka.

Great Creator, I am afraid.

No Sinew-Eater, not now.

Hear me, I am begging.

Give me a good life instead.

All the bad reviews are so surprising. It smells pretty much how I imagined it would. Like a sexier, more complex cocoa butter. Upon applying to skin, I smell a sweet, SLIGHTLY powdery honey. 30 minutes later, the chocolate comes into play and I start to smell a little amber. An hour later, it’s mostly powdery chocolate/amber. It’s not gourmand, but it is sweet enough, but not syrupy sweet by any means. It’s a mature smell but not exclusively, I’m 31 and I would have worn this about 5 years ago. Probably even before that. 

This is definitely a fall/winter, or cool spring/summer nights scent. It’s in the same category as Sensual Amber. I’ve never smelled Midnight Amber Glow so I can’t attest to that one. I have a lot of scents from BBW, and sometimes those can start to all smell the same. IYKYK. But this one is different, and I’m glad I blind bought two bottles. Happy to have this in my collection! Longevity and projection is average, definitely better than say, Cotton Candy Clouds which is almost non-existent for my dry skin. Definitely sticks to pajamas after a shower. I don’t layer scents because I don’t love their body washes and most FFMs aren’t worth it to me. I’m a perfume/EDP girlie. Also, I think this would pair well with darker amber/coffee/vanilla perfumes; such as YSL Black Opium or even Choco Musk.  🖤",10,1750809414.0,bathandbodyworks,5,0.92,False

She expressed interest in investing in an automatic espresso machine so she can switch to Americanos.  I suggested we run by Williams Sonoma to taste test a unit to make sure it produced what she was looking for.  The sales person used I think a Jura J8 or something similar.  Definitely a Jura and it was around $3500 or $4000.  She made an americano for my wife and an espresso shot for me.  The espresso shot was about as good as our Nespresso machine produces - not bad, but with maybe a bit over-extracted flavor.  The americano was pretty much undrinkable - like weak instant coffee.  It's hard to believe this was user error (you just pressed the button), bad settings, a dirty machine, or bad coffee (they use Illy) but maybe(?)  What am I missing?  Are super-autos supposed to match a coffee house experience or is that expecting to much?  Is there a home machine that can produce an espresso shot equivalent to what I'd get in a decent coffee house and if so, what is it? Thanks.",1,1750809341.0,superautomatic,6,1.0,False

This is me in Professor Kukui cosplay (with a shirt bc I was at work lol): https://imgur.com/a/qhxvjqo

About me: I am a librarian working in Texas but looking to move away. I have no girlfriend, wife, or children to worry about, so I’m free to move wherever makes the most sense for me. I joke that there are three pillars to my personality: Pokemon, soccer, and ASOIAF. They are by far the things that I enjoy most but I have a lot of interests. Im a bit of a creative dilettante; I enjoy singing, acting, writing, composing, podcasting and have recently taken up drawing though I’m not very good at it. I speak English and Spanish fluently and am starting to move beyond “elementary” level in French. I am also learning Irish and Japanese, but I am in absolute baby-language with those. I’m a big reader and lately I’ve gotten into nonfiction science books, but I’m not above popular stuff. I relatively recently read the first ACOTAR book and Fourth Wing and liked both of them fine though I must admit I have basically no desire to keep reading them 😅. 

I am a vegetarian so I cook a bit bc I live in small town Texas lol. I also workout five to six times a week, I love coffee and have a bit of an aesthetic eye so I really like fashion. I wouldn’t say I’m like “into” fashion, but I dress well. My style is somewhere at the intersection of 1950s slacks and suspenders type stuff, dark academia style, mixed with my own personal preference for modernity. But don’t get me wrong- I’m just as likely to wear a t-shirt and jeans lol. The part that’s hard to get past for some people is that I really like jazz/swing music and swing dancing lol… I’m not great at it, but it’s very old time-y so there aren’t many people who’ve heard or can even pretend to be interested in the music I listen to. Im very into the 1950s aesthetic in particular, but don’t get me wrong; I am very progressive. I can look like a tradhusband (is that a thing? I only ever see tradwife) but still support my LGBTQ+ and BIPOC kin. 

I’m financially stable but I’m nowhere near being able to support you, though the kind of woman I’m looking for probably wouldn’t want me to support her anyhow. I’ve lifted or am in the process of lifting myself out of generational poverty depending on how you define that. My mom is my hero; she came to the USA penniless and now helps train phlebotomists all across the country. It’s bc of her that I was able to make the most of my opportunities… or at least some of them lol.

About you: I don’t know! I don’t like trying to dictate what the world around me looks like. Besides being a futile effort, I like the whimsy of finding out who is out there and might enjoy getting to know someone like me. Of course, I’d have to be attracted to you, you’d have to be attracted to me and we’d have to be compatible in all the adult ways- that’s non-negotiable, but if you are very different from me but still found this intriguing, I’d love to know why and get to know you as well. Maybe we’ll hit it off, maybe one of us will ghost the other, maybe we’ll like each other just fine but there’s no real chemistry. Whatever happens, I appreciate you reading my little stream of consciousness post and hope you find someone you enjoy.

I’ve been working as a barista for about 6 years now, off and on. I’ve worked in 3 different coffee shops spanning literally coast to coast of the US, and it really hasn’t been until the last year that I’ve finally begun to find delivering customer service to the type of people who come in to be actually intolerable. I don’t know if it’s my age, or length of time in the industry, a general cultural shift towards incompetence, or an issue specific to the city that I work in now, (NYC.) For context, I started working in coffee because I actually, genuinely, enjoy making and drinking coffee. I like having regulars to catch up with and I love feeling proud of my hard work and skill when I serve drinks. But in the last few months especially, the level of disrespect from nearly every customer is becoming unbearable. Telling ME to be quiet when they’re on the phone, while they’re ordering, spilling their entire drink on the floor and laughing and FILMING ME while I mop it up, arguing with the entire staff that the shivering rat dog with inflated marble eyes they’re holding in their purse IS in fact their service dog… The list is unfortunately endless.

I have tried to lose around 10 pounds on/off for what seems like my entire life lol. I usually sit around the 145 mark but last summer I was 140 and I don’t even know what I did to gain weight. I’m pushing back up to 150 and it’s hurting my soul. I’m about 5’7 for reference. I also weight myself daily so I know a lot of times it could be fluctuation but I don’t understand how I never see 140 anymore and my routines have not changed!!!???? I also don’t know what’s normal anymore, I feel like fluctuating between 143 (my lowest rn) and 151 (my highest rn) is not normal!!! 

I am a VERY active person. Every. Single. Day. I get 10k steps AT LEAST! Most days I hit 15k. I spend at least 10 hours a day on my feet. I run at least 4 times a week and at least 2 miles every time. I was doing pilates and now I’m back to light weight lifting a few times a week. I play sand volleyball, swim, and say yes to every physical activity possible. 

I drink at least 4 32oz bottles of water every day, eat an okay amount of protein daily (I’d say around 50 grams daily) LOVE fruits and veggies. I eat less carbs than the average person and the carbs I do consume usually come from potatoes. Of course I love sweets and try to keep it very minimal so here and there I’ll have half a pastry from where I work or a sugary coffee maybe twice a week. Other than that I feel like I do everything right. I don’t track my calories as well as I probably should but I have general idea of how much I do actually eat. 

At this point I feel like I need to lower my deficit to 1,290 but I’m just so frustrated because I feel like with how active I am I should be able to have 1,400. By no means do I think I’m “fat” and Im not even considered overweight but I just feel uncomfortable in my body and feel like I’m holding onto extra weight.

Everything she bought was per pound I have to figure out the math on how much to take off. She has 8 different bags of nectarines that she decided to all bag seperately and are all different weights.

1ljqwyw,https://i.redd.it/xv6mifn7qy8f1.jpeg,Good Eating on Zepbound,"One of my secrets to losing a bunch of weight on Zepbound has been my weekly meal prep. 

On Sunday after church, I fire up the Blackstone and cook 4 pounds of lean ground chicken and 4 pounds of fresh vegetables with a little avocado oil and different seasonings (teriyaki, Mexican, Indian, Greek, or whatever I’m in the mood for that week). 

I then eat a 10 oz serving for lunch and dinner each day throughout the week. Each serving is 305 calories with 47 grams of protein, 14 grams of carbs and only 6 grams of fat. For breakfast, I have a whey protein shake with cocoa powder, creatine, chia, flax, and hemp seeds, and strawberries.  I start each day with coffee and marine collagen with some Chobani creamer. 

By the end of the day, I’ve eaten about 1350 calories, 180 grams of protein, 90 grams of carbs and 35 grams of fat. I burn about 700 calories a day lifting weights and walking. 

Is it monotonous?  Very. But when I step on the scale every morning and see I’ve lost another .6 lbs, I think that’s the sort of monotony I should enjoy. ",44,1750809054.0,Zepbound,16,0.98,False

1ljquga,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ljquga,Design help for Living Room Space - Small Apartment,"Hey everyone, I could use some design help for my living room setup.

This is my current layout (see photo). The apartment is around 500 sq ft, so the living area is part of a small open-concept space. My work desk and gaming setup are in the far corner, the sofa faces the TV, and there’s a kitchen peninsula on the left.

The challenge: There’s a large open area in the middle of the room, and I’m not sure how to make it feel more cohesive or complete.

I prefer a modern, clean, slightly minimalist aesthetic and want to avoid making the space feel cramped.

I’m looking for ideas for:

A coffee table or accent furniture?
Plants, lighting, or wall decor to help ground the space?
Possibly a round dining table — I have about 80 inches from the front door to my desk. Ideally, the table depth wouldn’t exceed 40” to avoid interfering with the entrance and overall flow.

Other Notes:
The sofa is black
The TV stand is white
The floors are light gray with a very subtle warm undertone
I’m open to small layout tweaks if it helps the space feel more functional or visually balanced.

I’m trying to be a bit spontaneous tonight and thought I’d throw this out there. I was born in Toronto but just moved to Downtown about two weeks ago. Most of my friends are still in Vaughan, North York, and Brampton, so I’m hoping to meet new people and build more of a circle down here.

I’m 32M, Caribbean, very active and social. I love trying new things and doing as much as I can. I’m into reading, day events, soca parties, EDM festivals, coffee shop hangs, hiking, meditation, anime, and pretty much every kind of music 🎶. I do drink socially and I am always looking for new experiences. I try to keep things positive and usually find something good in every situation.

I do not have anything planned tonight so I am open to whatever. Could be grabbing a coffee, a couple drinks, hanging out somewhere casual, or even playing some board games. I am feeling open to chill vibes, fun energy, or just good conversation with new faces.

Also, does anyone know a good spot to go on a Tuesday night where there is a nice vibe or some kind of social energy? I am open to suggestions if you know somewhere worth checking out.

I am based Downtown but happy to meet up anywhere in the city. Feel free to comment or send me a message, whichever feels more comfortable. All good vibes here. Just hoping to connect with cool people and start building some real friendships in the city 🙌

I am sorry in advance, but English is not my native language.
My best friend and I were best friend since middle school. We were soulmates, inseparable. My parents took us to vacations with them, we went to concerts. When I was in hospital she visited me, we cried together, laughed together, everything.
It all changes when I met my boyfriend in college, let's call him Eric. I was in a different city, and prior to my relationship I was visiting hometown often to see my parents and my best friend (fake name Coco). After I met Eric and my priorities shifted a little, I was going back home a little less. (She did let me know this, literally blamed me and said she felt neglected. I cried a lot and apologized.) Eric and my brother pointed this out and said to me not to let her treat me like that. My brother said it is ok to have different priorities, different interests and opinions, variety of friends in college. I listened and let it slide. After some time, Coco met her boyfriend trough us, and they started dating. Everything was fine now, since her priorities changed as well. But I did notice that she still did not like Eric, it took me years to find out why. Simply because he was the only one to say no to her, and to disagree with her. She could not stand him. Anyway, her boyfriend lives in a different state, she got scholarship there, to be with him. Mind you, he paid for everything, apartment, bills, food,etc. She always said she doesn't have money, although she worked PTJ. I asked her once where does your salary go, and she said she send money to her family. (At this point her Boyfriend was also studying, his mom paid all, very kind lady). I said you have 4 people who are working,living in the same household. Your siblings have 4 salaries and your mom receives pension. I don't understand why you don't pay for some groceries at least. I felt so bad for boyfriends mother, and her mother was a little greed. I know that woman since I was 13. At that time we were 26. Eric said it is not my problem, to just let it go. And so I did. After a year, she came to visit her family, and Corona hit, she couldn't go back, school was on pause. She needed a job and a place to stay, so I helped her get a job at company,eric and i suggested she stays with us, like a roommate. She agreed. My God, they were like cat and mouse, constantly fighting. She was asking me why Eric is not doing anything in the house, etc. I was taken aback, I said he is working everyday from 7 am to 10 pm, comes home, eats and sleeps. We were working from home. Both her and I. I also noticed the way she was talking with her boyfriend, and I was again shocked. He finally got the job and was doing good, he wanted to take some guitar lessons before she comes, as a hobby, because he could afford it finally and it was his dream. I was happy for him, but she said""i cannot belive you are wasting money like that, you should save it for when i get back"" (one month lessons were like 50$). After she finished, I told her ""I don't want to be rude, but I think you were a little harsh "" she told me man who have hobbies are either childish or wasting money. (Eric is collector of lego). I just said not true, I support him, if that makes him happy, then I am happy for him. I just ended there. After Corona she went back there, in the meantime before she went, Eric went to see his family and Cocos boyfriend. They were close.
Eric came back, she left, everything was fine. Until I received phonecall from my mom saying that Coco sent her message to stop by my mom's house to talk to her. I told my mom I have no idea why, didn't even know she came back. Mom told her to come, and mom told me she will call me later to tell me wth is happening. I went to my other friends house, explained what Is happening. I felt in my gut that some drama will happen. Eric was working at the time, and I didn't want to be alone. Few hours later my mom calls me, pissed off. Cocos bf cheated in her, he hired s** worker and went to hotel one night. He was drunk with friends and they all went. I was mad for her and hurt. But, that is not where my mom stopped, allegedly Eric was there as well. My jaw dropped. My friend prepared shot of alcohol imidiatly. I asked what date, did she show you any proof. I know he went to see his mom, she was sick, and had surgery, so he was taking care of her. I know because I talked to both of them often. He only had free time when he took her for check up, and he drank coffee that time with Cocos bf. I did not belive for a second that what she said was true, nor did my mom. The date she said was the date he came back home and was with me. Coco did not know Eric came home, and she already moved out at that point. I was livid. Took the shot, and planed what to do. Not only she lied about Eric, but instead of telling me, she went to my mom. Of course my mom will tell me, although she begged not to, I am close to my mom, she is my hero. The next day I went to my hometown and asked if we can drink coffee... when we met I asked her is there something you would like to tell me. She said no. I asked again if she is sure she said yes, I am sure. We left the coffee shop, said our goodbyes. She knew I knew, and chose not to say anything. I left and never looked back.
Later I found out from mutual friends that she was talking behind my back for years. How when I went to visit her she was embarrassed to walk in the street with me because I was fat, and people were looking. I went because she was complaining that she missed me a lot and wished I was there. I took 2 weeks vacation from work and went to be with her. 
She also said how my parents are rich, so why they don't pay weightloss surgery for me. My parents have money, not Me. I refused and said I will pay with my own money, since they paid school for me. 
I was shocked, but I still don't know if ghosting her was the best way. She also never texted me after that coffee. So, am i the AH?",1,1750808330.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

I bought this small business in February 2025 as a dessert shop, on Seven Sisters Road, N7 6AN. It's at a corner with internal dimensions of around 2 meters by 3.5 meters. Barely fits 1 person. Here are [Images of the business front](https://imgur.com/a/BT6rccS). It's on a very busy high road with loads of footfall. 

Before buying the business, I was told the monthly revenue of the business was around £4000-£5000 a month (I was shown some papers of the income).

***Financials***  
Rent including bills is £1350 (Sublease), open 7 days a week, 11 AM to 8 PM.

Nonetheless; February, I took a £750 loss. March £500 loss. April £300 profit. May £700 profit. June forecasting £300 loss.

My average daily income is around £30-£50 a day, 9-12 transactions, with an average transaction of around £3.50. £80-£100 on a good, hot & sunny day. 

**Issues**  
Drug users and homelessness is fairly high on that road, many drug users loiter around the road.  
  
I'm not sure if it's the business (Selling desserts & drinks) that is not appealing to the local residents or I'm doing something wrong (I'm getting loads of positive feedback from people that have come? Most my customers are regulars). Average age in the area is around 30-40 throughout the day.

I have noticed that most of my sales come from hot drinks, such as coffees and teas, few milkshakes and smoothies. I rarely sell any desserts, especially on hot days.

**Options**  
I've reached a point where something needs to be done, I can't afford more losses as this was my first business and invested all my savings into it.

I'm trying to explore other options that I can turn this shop into. I'm out of ideas due to the size of it. It's not big enough for anything viable in my opinion. 

1. **Turn it into a deli bar, wraps and sandwiches (Might appeal better for local residents due to their age).**
2. **I would love to sell the business. (I don't think I can due to signing a 12-month contract without a break clause) would save me from all this stress...**
3. **Any other business ideas that could work? A google map of the street has been attached with local businesses.**

""Aw man, I'm sorry we can't be partners Electro .Jr, I'm paired with, an orange named Orange"" Tox .Jr said while patting Electro .Jr on her shoulder

""Eh it's alright, being able to work with all kinds of people is an important attribute to have in the real world, plus I'm sure you can adapt to work with someone who isn't me"" Electro .Jr said while putting Tox .Jr's arm off her shoulder gently ""And I'm paired with *sigh* Goby""

""What's the matter with him, he has great ideas, good builder and is handy with machines"" Tox .Jr said

""It's not that, it's just, he always acts so awkward around me, even to the point to being distracted during some lectures"" Electro .Jr said

""Look, it's best we just go to our partners and begin work on our projects, you just need to get it over and done with"" Tox .Jr said before dashing off to Orange

""Hey, hey Tox"" Orange said

""What?"" Asked Tox .Jr

""Hey Tox"" Orange said

""What?"" Asked Tox .Jr annoyed

""Hey Tox"" Orange said

""What?"" Asked Tox .Jr more annoyed than before

""Hey Tox"" Orange said

""What?"" Asked Tox .Jr about to snap

""Hey Tox"" Orange said

""WHAT!"" Tox .Jr yelled angrily

""KNIFE!"" Orange said

Just then a knife appeared out of nowhere and sliced Tox .Jr in two causing some students to panic

""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, MURDERER!"" someone screamed

""Oh calm down"" Tox .Jr said while pushing her two halves back together ""Since my body is made of cream, I can't be killed stabbing or any sharp objects impaling me.""

""Woah, now that's going straight to the point. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA"" Orange said ""By the way, I'm Orange, but my fruity friends call me Annoying Orange""

""I'm Tox"" Tox .Jr said while pulling the knife out of her body ""But my friends call me Tox .Jr""

""Nice, I do have a idea that'll make you say orange you glad we're partners"" Orange said and Tox .Jr laughed a bit

Noticing her friend is doing well with her partner, Electro .Jr teleports to an empty seat next to Goby, as Goby turned around to see Electro .Jr sitting next to her, his face turned as red as a tomato.

""Oh, it's ni-ni-nice to be partners"" Goby said

""Yeah it's nice to be partners with you too. But I do have an idea for an invention, we can talk in further discussion at your house after school."" Electro .Jr said

""I don't think that's a good idea, my family lives in an underwater city called Bubbletucky, how about we talk about the project at your place"" Goby said ""Unless you have gills""

""Yeah good idea"" Electro .Jr acknowledged

We find ourselves in SMG4's castle in the main room where we see Electro .Jr and Goby looking at a blank sheet of paper.

""Wait no way, this place belongs to your mom and dad?"" Goby asked

""No it belongs to a friend of my father, but I do hang here often in most episodes"" Electro .Jr said acknowledging the fourth wall

""So, what's your idea?"" Goby asked picking up some paper

""Well, my idea is a robot that can do all kinds of chores for people, as it is quite a hassle to do them often."" Electro .Jr

""Two questions, won't those turn evil and cause a robot uprising? And where are the drinks here, I'm thirstier than a fish out of water"" Goby asked

""Don't worry, we can install a kill-code in the programming that'll activate if an uprising begins, and the fridge and beverages are right there"" Electro .Jr said pointing to the kitchen

A few minutes later, Snowflake comes up to Electro .Jr

""Hey watcha doing?"" Snowflake asked his electrifying friend

""Just sketching out blueprints for a group project for me and Goby, by the way can you check in on Goby in the kitchen for me? He's be in there for a while"" Electro .Jr asked looking up to see Snowflake give a thumbs up

Snowflake walks in the kitchen to see Goby sitting on a stool staring at a picture of Electro .Jr next to a boombox. Goby puts a CD in the boombox and presses the play button causing a power ballad to play, he then backs up a bit, sits on the floor and begins to sing with the room beginning to flood with water

Goby: ""Your smile answers my silent scream""

""Your photo on the screen""

""My eyes well up, I vent my spleen""

""Your photo on the screen""

""Your chair a throne you're like a queen""

""My heart is drenched in gasoline""

""You look at me yet I'm unseen""

""Your photo on the screen""

""WITHOUT YOU! I CAN'T BREEEAAATH!""

""WITHOUT YOU! I CAN'T BREEEAAATH!""

""WITHOUT YOU! I CAN'T BREEEAA-""

""What's going on man?"" Snowflake asked in a watered down voice interrupting Goby's musical number

""Nothing"" Goby responded before all the water disappeared and the two faceplant on the ground

""Really, then what was that musical number for, are you trying to ask that picture of Electro .Jr out"" Snowflake said jokingly

""Alright fine, I've always had a crush on her, I just find her pretty, nice and I want to ask her out, but my braincells turn to mush when I try"" Goby explained his problem

""Well I'm not that experienced in romance, but I do know that Electro .Jr's heart is a tough nut to crack, as she'd rather focus on her future career as an engineer than on long term romantic relationships"" Snowflake said ""But Sensei Wu taught me that actions speak louder than words, so you should try to do something nice for her, like give her a gift, even if she rejects your love, it's better to have closure, then to never get an answer.""

""Ok, thanks for the advice man"" Goby said while hugging Snowflake and he began to shiver ""BRRRRRR, why do you have to be made of snow, I can't hug you without the risk of getting frostbite""

""That's what you get for befriending the Elemental Guardian of Ice."" Snowflake said while putting a blanket on Goby

Goby returns to Electro .Jr with a soft drink bottle in hand and sits down next to Electro .Jr

""Sorry I took so long, being a mermaid out of water can really make you thirsty"" Goby said

""It's alright, I already have a blueprint all ready for the project, now all we need to do is build it"" Electro .Jr said while picking up the blueprints she made ""You got the materials we were supplied with?""

""Yeah, I got all of them right there"" Goby said while pointing to a box

The day of the presentation comes and all the engineer students are in the gymnasium each having their invention on display on top of a table, each pair of students are being interviewed by Zane and the other teachers of the engineering course, while Electro .Jr and Goby are waiting for their turn to present, Electro .Jr notices Goby shaking

""You're nervous right? Just take a deep breath and close your eyes"" Electro .Jr said putting her hand over Goby's shoulder

""Umm, thanks, but I just hugged Snowflake before I got to class. So you think we can win this?"" Goby asked looking over to Electro .Jr

""Well some of these inventions are quite genius, like the auto twirling fork or the electric multi tool"" Electro .Jr said

""It's alright if you don't win, cause we'll win with our awesome inventions"" Tox .Jr said

Both Goby and Electro .Jr turned to see Tox .Jr standing in front of her table display with Orange on her shoulder

""What makes you think you're gonna win this?"" Goby asked as Zane and Sandy Cheeks walk up to her table

""Alright Tox Cidus and Annoying Orange, what do you have to present us"" Zane asked

""Alright, now let me ask you a question, have you ever gone out with a lady friend and their taking forever to get ready?"" Tox .Jr asked

""Yeah, women want to look their best while going out."" Sandy replied

""Well introduce the revolutionary invention, behold, THE MAKEUP GUN!"" Orange said while Tox .Jr picked up the rifle with containers putting makeup in the barrel ""Close your eyes Electro""

Electro .Jr had a purple light flash on her forehead showing that she'd get blasted by Tox .Jr and Orange's invention. Not wanting to get blasted, she ducked as Tox .Jr pulled the trigger, but the makeup hit Goby as soon as he turned around.

""AH!"" Goby said flinching when the makeup hit his face causing him to fall on the floor ""OH WHY DID THIS HAPPEN TO ME""

""C'mon Goby, makeup your mind and show your face to the judges HAHAHAHAHAHA!"" Orange said as Goby got up and revealed his face showing that the makeup that got on his face became a mess

""Tox .Jr, you got the makeup gun on the whore setting"" Zane said pointing to the dial with an arrow pointing to whore

""Well, we did get some inspiration from the Simpsons, but we did add in our own twist, like the makeup rearranging setting"" Orange said while Tox .Jr turned the dial to rearrange.

As Tox .Jr pulled the trigger, a bunch of hands came out of the barrel and started patting, wiping and rearranging makeup on Goby's face, when it was done, the hands retreated back to the barrel

""*COUGH* *COUGH* Man I think some of that powder got in my throat"" Goby said while beating his chest. As the smoke cleared, the judges were in shock to see Goby have his face highly detailed in beautiful with makeup dazzling his appearance

""Okay that is quite a beautiful appearance"" Zane said ""But you were supposed to come up with an invention of your own idea. Anyways, Goby, Electro, you're the last pair to review, now show us your invention""

""Oh well, here it is then"" Goby said while pulling the sheet off the table revealing a robot on the table. The robot had a bulky exterior with a cube chest compartment, metal cylinder limbs with claw hands and rectangular prism feet ""Behold our invention, called the Chore-Tron 5000""

""The programming inside it allows it to complete all kinds of chores with ease. Just watch"" Electro .Jr said while turning to the robot

""P0WER-0N, LISTENING"" Chore-Tron said in a robotic voice

""Do dishes and mop the floor"" Electro .Jr said

""C0MMAND INTEGRATED, INITIATING PR0T0CAL"" the Chore-Tron walked off the table revealing it stood at a height of 5""11 and to the small pile of dirty dishes next to where it was sitting

""DIRTY DISHES SP0TTED, INITIATING CLEANING PR0CESS"" the robot opened it's chest compartment showing a cylinder structure inside and multiple racks appeared from the sides. Chore-Tron began to put the dishes inside it's compartment and a smaller compartment slid open for soap to enter. Once both the dishes and soap were in place, the Chore-Tron began to close the compartments

""DISHES AND S0AP IN PLACE, BEGINNING CLEANSING"" the robot began to vibrate a bit

""Isn't it supposed to mop the floor too?"" Sandy asked

""Just give it a second"" Electro .Jr said

""BEGINNING M0PPING PR0CESS"" the robot retracted it's claws inside it's arms and a bundle of ropes came out of it soaked in cleaning chemicals. Now the Chore-Tron began to extend it's arms to wipe the gymnasium floors with ease

""Wow that is quite an impressive invention, you two might have a shot of winning this"" Zane told the duo

""Thanks put the design was Electro's idea, I just helped build the body"" Goby said

A few minutes later we find Zane and the other teachers of the engineer course on stage to announce the winner

""The competition was tough, with many great inventions, but the winning pair goes to the duo that made an invention that had the biggest positive impact on the world the winners will not only receive a trophy for their efforts, they'll also receive a cash prize of $500 each, and the winners are"" Zane said while his arm printed out a piece of paper and he begins to read it ""Electro Volt and Goby Imani with their invention, the Chore-Tron 5000""

""WOW WE WON THAT'S AMAZING"" Goby said excitedly

""Yeah that is great"" Electro .Jr said pulling a smile before teleporting to the stage with Goby

While Goby and Electro .Jr receive their trophy and cash prize, Zane asked them a question

""You got anything to say to everyone else here?"" Zane asked

""Hm, I got nothing"" Goby replied

""Yeah same here"" Electro .Jr added

After school we see Electro .Jr and Goby going to the front of Cartoon Academy to wait there to be picked up, while waiting there Goby began to turn to Electro .Jr and began to speak.

""Electro .Jr, I have something to confess"" Goby said

""Okay then, say what you need to say"" Electro .Jr

""Well the thing is, I lo-lo-li-"" Goby tried to confess his feelings to Electro .Jr but couldn't get words out

Just then, a car and the Mario mobile turned to the front of the school and Electro and Gardevoir come out of the Mario mobile and two mermaids come out of the other car. One had a dark skin tone with a dark purple and blue tail with an black shirt on and had a muscular build with dark blue hair, the other also had a dark skin tone, but she had a blue tail with purple spots and a bikini with a similar colour scheme and a purple ponytail.

""MOM, DAD, GREAT NEWS"" Goby said while rushing to his parents ""Me and my partner won the invention contest, WE GOT FIRST PRIZE"" Goby said excitedly

""That's great honey, you must've worked real hard for it"" Goby's mother said

""Well, the invention was all my partner's idea, I just helped build it"" Goby said pointing to Electro .Jr being picked up by Electro

""You won first prize Electro .Jr, that's amazing"" Electro said

""So you must be Electro Volt our son told us about, I'm Isaac Imani, head of Bubbletucky Construction"" Isaac said pulling out his arm to shake hands

""Nice to meet you. I'm Electro Volt, Elemental Guardian of Electricity"" Electro said shaking hands and giving Isaac a slight shock

""Ow, man I've read about the Elemental Guardians but I've always wanted to see one in person, seeing one with the naked eye is such an honour"" Isaac said while going around Electro observing his body

""Is he always like this?"" Gardevoir asked Goby's mother

""Well yes, ever since he was a kid, his father was saved by an Elemental Guardian of Water and that experience sparked a major fascination for them. But let's address the elephant in the room, YOU CAN TALK!"" Goby's mom said in shock

""Well, yes, it mainly involved an incident with a magic YouTube remote"" Gardevoir said referencing the YouTube arc ""I'm Gardevoir by the way""

""I'm Ollie, pleasure to meet you"" Ollie said shaking hands with Gardevoir

""Well I should be going now, but can we take a picture before we go?"" Isaac asked Electro

""Sure thing, always glad to meet someone who appreciates the Elemental Guardians"" Electro said

The two snap a picture and the two families head their separate ways

Tomorrow morning Electro .Jr woke up revealing the green piece on her head is in fact a head, she got out of bed and opened up her closet to find many green hats hanging on racks, she picks a hat from the rack with her psychic powers and sniffs it

""*sniff* *sniff* Ugh, that's going in the wash."" Electro .Jr said putting the hat in a laundry basket and she picks another hat ""*sniff* *sniff* Perfect"" Electro .Jr said putting on the hat

As she came out of her room and into the living room, she notices Electro, Gardevoir along with Goby and his parents talking to Zane and a man in a wheelchair

""Mom, dad, what's going on?"" Electro .Jr asked teleporting on Electro's lap

""Oh, junior, this is Cyrus Borg, head of Borg Industries, Zane told him about you and Goby's invention and that took notice of him"" Electro explain

""Why yes, and I would ask you if you two would like to have the Chore-Tron be a Borg Industries product, as Borg Industries thrives in making inventions that can improve the public's quality of life. You two being the creators will each get a cut of the funds as long as you two agree to the contract"" Borg says while putting a piece of paper on the coffee table

Electro .Jr begins to read the contract

""What are you doing?"" Goby asked

""I've seen plenty of cartoons where someone signs a contract without reading it first and ends up missing a detail that ruins their life, so I'm just checking to see if there's any details here that'll bite us in the butt later on."" Electro .Jr said ""Okay, it seems to have no loose ends other than doing an interview in two days on public tv, are you okay with this, Goby? You often stutter a bit while talking""

""Yeah, this project made us make an invention to change the world for the better, so might as well put it to use and I'm sure I'll be fine."" Goby said

The two sign the contract and hand over the blueprints to Cyrus Borg

""Excellent, we'll have prototypes ready tomorrow, and you two must get ready for the interview tomorrow."" Cyrus Borg told the two kids before heading off

""Hey Electro .Jr, Goby, can we talk for a bit, there's something I need to tell you?"" Electro asked her daughter

""Okay, just make it quick, Season 7 of Gumball is premiering in an hour"" Electro .Jr said looking at a clock

The two head into Electro's bedroom and Electro .Jr and Goby sits on Gardevoir and Electro's bed

""Although I'm glad your product got you two first prize and made it to Borg Industries, I'm warning you both to not let greed overcome either of you"" Electro said

""Relax dad, I can help the world and make a fortune, just like Mr. Beast."" Electro .Jr told her father

""Yeah, and just because we signed a business contract doesn't mean we're greedy"" Goby said

""That's what an old friend of my Great Great Great Great [Greatx100] Grandfather once said"" Electro said pulling up a photo of his ancestor standing next to a YouTuber

""What are you implying?"" Electro .Jr asked

""Well, a long time ago, there was a YouTuber who fought alongside the Animation Alliance in the great Animation War, he was just like you, strong, smart, creative and inventive. He went by the name GameToons."" Electro said and that name scared Goby

""Are you alright, if this story is too much for you too handle you can leave."" Electro said

""No it's not that, the thing is, GameToons was actually my Great Great Great Great [Greatx100] Grandfather, it's not something I like to admit"" Goby said putting his head down

""Why is that?"" Electro .Jr asked

""Well, before I got interrupted, GameToons was the best friend of the Elemental Guardian of Electricity and an amazing warrior of the Animation Alliance"" Electro said as a flashback occurred of a man with a shirt with a big G and T on it beating up content farm soldiers with a Yellow Pikmin who had storm markings on his body

""He fought for what's right, even when the odds were stacked against him, but one day while he was off on an expedition to improve his invention, a mind cleaner, a device capable of making someone immune to the brainwashing of Content Farms"" Electro narrated as GameToons walk off in the sunset after saying goodbye to his friend ""But sadly, while in the wild, something in him changed, he became the very thing he swore to destroy and I don't know why.""

""I can explain, my grandfather told me why GameToons turned to the dark side"" Goby said

""Well what happened"" Electro said sitting next to Goby and Electro .Jr ""I'm curious why he turned to the side of brain rot""

""Well, he was approached by the man who caused the rise of Content Farms, Johnney"" Goby said surprising Electro ""He told him that he would receive a fortune if he joined his side, in return, he will give his eternal loyalty to Content Farms becoming one of the Content Farm generals""

""And when he returned, he wasn't an ally, but an enemy. My ancestor didn't want to take the life of a friend, so using a special machine, he banished him to another realm, where he was surrounded by electricity. A place called the Internet."" Electro finished the story ""That story has been passed down from generation to generation, to warn what greed can do to you""

""It's alright Mr. Volt, I won't follow in my ancestors footsteps, me and Electro .Jr use money to change the world, not to just benefit ourselves only"" Goby said hugging Electro ""Anyways I gotta go see ya""

Tomorrow morning in Electro .Jr's room, we see her getting ready as she puts on her best clothing, being a white dress with a thunderbolt pattern on it and her green hat all Ralts wear, just then, Electro walks in

""Sweetie, we're going leave for the interview in 5 minutes, be sure to-"" Gardevoir said looking at her daughter ""Well you seem ready""

""Yeah, I just hope the public will like the Chore-Tron 5000"" Electro .Jr said before being picked up by her mother

""Don't worry my little charger, I'm sure they'll love it."" Gardevoir said ""Now we better get going, Cyrus Borg isn't going to wait any longer""

""Also you're father isn't going to be there as he is hanging out with Mr. Imani as his request, also great news, the invention you and Goby made was an overnight success"" Gardevoir responded

Once outside, the two see in Limo in front of the Onion. Electro .Jr and Gardevoir sits in the back and finds Goby wearing a mini tuxedo.

""Hey Electro, isn't it great that the Chore-Tron was an instant hit?"" Goby asked

""Yeah it is"" Electro .Jr responded

""Alright, we're headed to Meme News Studio, so be prepared for the interview"" Cyrus Borg said rolling down the window in the front

At the interview, we see Electro .Jr, Goby and Cyrus Borg sitting on a couch being interviewed by a news reporter wearing a business suit sitting on a desk with Gardevoir sitting on a chair in the audience

""So tell me Cyrus Borg, what got you too notice the Chore-Tron"" the interview asked

""Well it's quite simple, the group project also had a second prize, being that the winners would be offered an opportunity that their invention would be a Borg Industries product, and they'll receive a cut of the profits."" Borg explained

""Great response, and now, let's ask those young geniuses a question."" The interviewer said before turning to Goby ""Tell me young man, what inspired you and you're partner to make such a genius invention?""

""Actually, the invention was all Electro's idea, I mainly built the frame and body while she did the programming and electronics, she's quite a genius with machines"" Goby answered

""Alright then, young lady, what was you're inspiration"" the Interviewer asked

""Well chores are quite a hassle even with appliances to help, so it's about time to make an invention that'll downright do them for us"" Electro .Jr

""Alright great response, but what inspired you both to partner with Borg Industries"" the Interviewer asked

""Well, I mainly did it to help the world out"" Goby responded

""I did that too, but I also did the deal as I can help support my financial future-"" Electro .Jr responded before people started booing and throwing snacks at her

""BOOOO"" someone said

""GREEDY WHORE"" another one said

""PEOPLE LIKE YOU MAKE THIS WORLD A TERRIBLE PLACE!"" a woman said

Electro .Jr was taking cover with protect to shield herself from the debris

""TAKE THIS YOU SLUT!"" someone said before throwing a chair at Electro .Jr

Before the chair hit her Goby grabbed it and put it down aggressively

""ALL RIGHT THAT'S IT!"" Goby snapped causing the audience to go silent ""ME AND THIS WONDERFUL LADY MADE AN INVENTION THAT'LL CHANGE THE WORLD WHILE YOU PEOPLE AREN'T DOING ANYTHING! AND HOW DO YOU REPAY HER, BY ACCUSING HER OF BEING GREEDY ALL CAUSE SHE WANTED TO HELP SUPPORT HER FUTURE! SO WHO'S THE GREEDY BASTARD HERE, ME AND THIS WOMAN WHO MADE AN A GROUNDBREAKING INVENTION, OR YOU LAZY ASSES WHO AREN'T DOING ANYTHING!""

As Goby yelled, Electro .Jr looked at him and she felt something she never felt before

""Well that was certainly experience folks, guess todays interview is over folks, see ya tomorrow."" the Interviewer said

As the interviewer finished his sentence, Goby walked out of the studio in angry huff with Electro .Jr and Gardevoir pushing Cyrus Borg's wheelchair following him. While in the hallway, Cyrus Borg signals Gardevoir to push his wheelchair over to Goby, once there Borg began to talk to Goby

""Goby, I have to tell you something, I appreciate that you stood up for Electro, but that wasn't an appropriate response"" Cyrus Borg told the young Goby

""So, they were picking on Electro and I had to stand up for her"" Goby said angerly

""Yeah, but the media and public will tear you apart and you'll be ruined, so let that be a warning for next time"" Cyrus Borg said

Electro .Jr then teleported next to Goby

""Hey Goby, thanks for standing up for me, I never thought that people would hate others who want to make a steady living"" Electro .Jr said

""That's people for you, they accuse others of anything to get a good story to the public"" Cyrus Borg said ""How about I just get you three home for now""

""Alright, I hope this doesn't traumatize my daughter"" Gardevoir said

Meanwhile at the Onion, Gardevoir and Electro .Jr hop out of the limo and begin to walk inside and say goodbye to the others. Later that night, we see Electro .Jr in her bed and Electro walks in

""Hey junior, Gardevoir told me what happened, hope you're okay"" Electro said

""Yeah, it's nothing, dad, can I ask you something?"" Electro .Jr asked

""Okay what is it?"" Electro asked

""Well, it's about Goby, ever since he stood up for me, I've felt something I never felt before, I feel like I want to be with him, do you know something about that?"" Electro .Jr asked

""Oh that's quite simple, it's love"" Electro said

""WAIT WHAT!?"" Electro .Jr said in shock

""Simple, that event must've sparked a love for him, and between you and me, he seems to feel the same way about you"" Electro said ""Anyways goodnight sweetie""

""Thanks dad, goodnight"" Electro .Jr said before tucking in

Tomorrow morning Electro .Jr wakes up and today feels gloomy, she walks in the living and turns on the TV and the news channel happens to be on.

""Breaking News, the hit invention the Chore-Tron 5000 seems to have started an uprising"" a News reporter said

""Wait what, that's impossible, the kill code should've activated to stop this from happening"" Electro .Jr said in a worried tone ""Oh geez what will Cyrus Borg think of me"" a thought bubble came out of Electro .Jr's head and it shows Cyrus Borg angry at her and Goby

""I can't believe you both, unleashing an invention that caused the apocalypse, you ruined my company's reputation, SO I'LL RUIN YOU!"" Cyrus Borg said angerly in the thought bubble

""The robots are brainwashing the public with content farms, symptoms of hypnotism main include, swirly pupils, unexpressive faces, drooling mouths, and saying brainrot phrases which may include, what the sigma, skibidi, ohio, rizz, and many more. Inventor Goby may be at fault due to his outburst to the public yesterday"" the News reporter said

Just then, Cyrus Borg, and Goby come into the living room rushing at Electro .Jr

""AAAAHHH IT'S NOT MY FAULT, THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN!"" Electro .Jr screamed while preparing for the inevitable

""What no, I came to tell you something"" Cyrus Borg said

""W-What is it?"" Electro .Jr said

""Something hacked into the mainframe of the Chore-Tron's database and disabled the kill code and caused the uprising"" Cyrus Borg explained

""And people all over the world are being brainwashed with Content Farms, including my parents"" Goby said before turning to the TV ""Oh no""

Electro and Gardevoir came into the living room looking tired

""Hey what's going on, I woke up and todays sky called cloudy with a chance of apocalypse"" Electro said

""I know who is behind this"" Goby said pointing to the tv showing someone getting brainwashed by a Chore-Tron showing a cartoonish G and T on the robots visor ""It's my ancestor GameToons

""WHAT!"" Electro said ""I thought my ancestor stopped him""

""Well he appears to be unstoppable in the internet as any physical ways of touching him is impossible"" Cyrus Borg said

""Hang on, I got an idea"" Goby said before tugging on Electro's arm ""Mr. Volt, didn't you're ancestor banish GameToons to the internet""

""Uh yes, why are you asking?"" Electro asked

""Well how about we got into the internet through a machine and beat him up there"" Goby said putting his fists together

""Well the machine my ancestor used to banish him is still in the attic"" Electro said ""Wait here

A few minutes later, we see a machine containing a two capsules in the living room with Electro standing next to it

""This bad boy can take us to the internet and only a Elemental Guardian of Electricity can get people out"" Electro said

""Alright fire it up"" Gardevoir said

""One problem, it doesn't have any power, and it can only be powered by the energy of an Avatar"" Electro said ""So that's why Mario is here"" Electro pointed at Mario

""Hello"" Mario waved at our protagonists

""Hi Mario"" Goby said

""Now I will head to fight GameToons in the internet as Electro .Jr hasn't mastered her elemental power"" Electro said

""I'm coming whether you like it or not, I need to master my elemental power of Electricity and I need to save my invention"" Electro .Jr said

""I'm coming too"" Goby said

""Um, Goby, he'll kill you"" Electro said putting his hand on Goby's shoulder

""It's my invention too, also me and my family have been haunted by GameToon's for generations, it's about time to settle the score with my family's past, and I want to save my parents"" Goby said

""Alright, but don't say I didn't warn you, Mario, get in the power capsule"" Electro said

""Okie dokie"" Mario said before hopping in the capsule to power the machine and Electro, his daughter and Goby hop in the other capsule

""Okay honey, FIRE IT UP!"" Electro said

""Okay, please come back safely"" Gardevoir said before hitting the power button

The machine began to shake a bit and Mario's body began to glow and the machine began to making a whring noise and a bunch of electricity shot out of the machine and zapping ensued on each of the capsules before a flash of light emerges from the light

Electro, Electro .Jr and Goby stood up to see them standing on black ground with green 1s and 0s flowing through it

""Where are we, are we dead?"" Goby asked

""No, we're here, the internet"" Electro said before hearing a static noise

""Hello, can you hear me?"" Cyrus Borg asked

""Yeah, loud and clear, but how are you talking to me""

""I placed an earpiece on you so we can communicate with each other, now, I'm pulling up a map of the internet, okay do you three see the giant green tower with green light flowing out of it? Our sources says that there is a giant energy source coming at the top, so GameToons"" Cyrus Borg asked

""What tower- OH MY GOODNESS!"" Electro turned around to see a giant tower standing a extreme heights with Goby and Electro .Jr turning around as well gasping

""Yeah I ain't climbing that"" Electro .Jr said before teleporting herself, Electro and Goby to the top

""Well look who we have here, my descendant and the descendants of the one who banished me"" a shadowy figure said standing at the edge

""You must be GameToons"" Electro .Jr said

""You are correct young lady"" the mysterious figure said

""I'LL KILL YOU!"" Goby yelled before charging at GameToons but GameToons dodged to the right and Goby fell off the edge ""AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!""

""Arceus damnit, I'll get him"" Electro .Jr said before teleporting away for a second and teleporting back with Goby in her arms

""You saved me Electro .Jr, thank you-AHHH!"" Goby said before Electro .Jr dropped her ""OW!""

""Next time, think before you charge headfirst into battle with an army general"" Electro .Jr said looking down at Goby

""Noted"" Goby said dizzy

""Why'd you turned to the side of Johnney, you were supposed to stop the Content Farms, not join them"" Electro said ""Bring balance to animation, not leave it in brain rot. The Animation Alliance trusted you. You were their friend""

""Oh you quality cartoons are all the same, you see, friends are temporary, but fortune and fame remains forever."" GameToons said ""And why bother building up friendship and respect for your work when brainwashing people is more efficient and effective. Enjoy being my slave, FOREVER!"" GameToons then aimed a hypnotizing laser at Electro .Jr

""No, NOT MY DAUGHTER"" Electro said before jumping in front of Electro .Jr taking the blast for her

""No DAD!"" Electro .Jr said with tears in her eyes

Electro stood up, but he was different, he was brainwashed

""Content Farms, shall, rise"" Electro said zombielike

""Well that was easy enough, but you're next"" GameToons charged at Electro .Jr

Electro closed her eyes but nothing happened

""Hang on what's going on?"" Electro .Jr opened her eyes

Electro .Jr saw in front of her that Goby caught Gametoons' fist and was holding him back

""My my, my strength carries on through generations, but no matter, you'll be zombified like the rest of your family."" GameToons said before screaming in pain ""AH! OW"" Goby kicked him in the pingas

""You brought shame on my family, I've spent years of bullying all because of YOU!"" Goby said before ruthlessly attacking GameToons with punches and kicks with his tail.

Goby soon pinned him down and kept up his ruthless assault on GameToons

""So that's why he stood up for me, he was ruthlessly bullied all because of GameToons"" Electro .Jr though before she saw Goby get struck by lightning ""GOBY NO!"" Electro .Jr yelled

Turns out that the electricity came from Electro brainwashed. Electro .Jr caught Goby and summoned some soft electric clouds to lay him on

""See young lady, you, your fish tailed friend and I are not the same, I saw that interview yesterday, and learned we each use finances for our personal gain"" GameToons explain

""You're wrong"" Electricity began to surround Electro .Jr as she spoke ""You just use finances for your own personal gain and to benefit yourself only, while me and Goby, we use money to change the world for the better""

Meanwhile in the real world we see Cyrus Borg and Gardevoir sitting around the machine

""Oh, I hope their alright"" Gardevoir said worried for her family's safety

""Don't worry, it seems a surge of energy is surrounding Electro .Jr indicated she's overflowing with power"" Cyrus Borg said before closing his left eye as the machine was emitting an insane amount of energy ""WHAT'S GOING ON, THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN!""

""Hehe, dying tickles"" Mario said seeing his body glowing

""Hang on, I think I know what's happening."" Gardevoir said standing up ""My daughter must've reached her true potential""

Meanwhile in the internet world we see Electro .Jr flying up and surging with energy, electricity shooting out her body and her body began to turn into blue light

""No it can't be, she's evolving"" Goby said in a weak voice opening his eyes slightly

Electro .Jr began to evolve and as the light faded away, she now looked like Kirlia with a thundercloud dress and the two horns on her green hat now resemble the ears of a Yellow Pikmin

""You have brought shame to the world of animation and now shall pay the ultimate price"" Electro .Jr said before unleashing a load of electricity at GameToons

""No, this power, I can't take it, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" GameToons yelled as he exploded with electricity

""Now to fix the mess he made"" Electro .Jr said before unleashing an electrical wave which reaches through every Chore-Tron's visor and cancels the brainwashing GameToons did

As Electro .Jr slowly descended to the ground, Electro came up to her

""OH MAN SWEETIE, THAT WAS AMAZING, AND YOU REACHED YOU'RE FULL POTIENTAL, THAT'S GREAT!"" Electro said excitedly

""Thanks dad"" Electro .Jr said before turning around to see Goby swim up to her weakly

""Great job Electro .Jr"" Goby said ""I hope you still have some energy to get us out of here""

""Right, but first"" Electro .Jr then leaned down to Goby's height and kissed Goby on the lips and the three exit the internet while Electro .Jr is still kissing Goby

""Smooth moves Electro .Jr"" Gardevoir said

Electro .Jr noticed she's not in the internet anymore and teleports away from Goby while blushing",8,1750808228.0,SMG4,1,1.0,False

Last week, I felt like I was slowly coming to following the most brutal wave yet. I wasn't being life productive, but I was able to do some tasks and projects to help maintain a bit of sanity. I had a good support group meeting and therapy appointment, then for whatever reason, just as it seemed like I was about to get a sip of air, ***bam***, the next wave crashes in. Everything immediately escalates.

Every goddamn time I even get a hint of the thought that says, *""you know, maybe there is at least some kind of a chance that things will be well enough in the future. Maybe I can get through this eventually,""* the next wave breaks the new levee, and the flooding resumes.

Once when I was young I almost got taken out by a tidal wave that came in while I was waist deep. It  knocked me down and dragged me all the way up the beach. I was underwater and I had to to the hardest pushup ever to get my head above water, and I had about 1 second to get a breath before my arms buckled and I had to start all over again. After several times doing this, I knew I had very few reps I had the strength left to do. In that moment, I pondered wether I should just let go and accept my fate. Luckily, I then managed to dig into the sand deep enough to stop my momentum and get back up. I was dragged probably 300ft up the shore. 

That memory has been resurfacing a lot lately, noticing the parallels to my hell right now, because that experience is a perfect metaphor for how a lot of this feels. Every time I think it's about to get a little easier, it gets harder than before, and I'm weaker than I was then. 

The PTSD has been beating the absolute shit out of me these last several days. It rocks me early in the morning and drains everything I've got right at the start of the day. I keep waking up earlier and earlier. I can't even make it to 7:00 AM before I'm dizzy from all the spinning and I go running to the coffee shop so I'm not alone. Several times a day, the same thing happens and I have to quickly think of somewhere to go because it's just crushingly brutal. I can't last more than 2 hours in the house or any one place without going through this. Most of the time, I'm in tears within 30 seconds of getting back home.

It keeps getting harder. I keep growing weaker. My body feels as though it's running out of energy, and at times I'm amazed it still manages to drag one foot in front of the other.

Before anyone asks, I've been in  therapy for over 25 years and I see my therapist regularly. I have support groups, a psychiatrist, and meds. I don't have close friends or relatives to lean on, or really any form of support, because all of that is in my wife's urn. I have some others here that I talk to, but it's not quite the same, you know?",9,1750808210.0,SuicideBereavement,0,1.0,False

Traveling as an introvert can be a uniquely enriching experience, allowing for personal reflection and a deeper connection to the destinations visited. Here are elegant travel tips designed for those who prefer solitude over socializing.

Choose serene destinations. Quiet towns, nature retreats, and less frequented cultural sites allow introverts to recharge away from the hustle and bustle. Research tranquil locations where you can enjoy scenic views or peaceful surroundings without overwhelming crowds.

Travel during off-peak times. To avoid the noise and chaos of large crowds, plan your trips during less popular seasons or weekdays. Early morning flights or late-night train rides might also provide a quieter journey, making your travel experience more pleasant.

Opt for cozy accommodations. Look for boutique hotels, quaint bed and breakfasts, or homestays that offer a more intimate setting. These types of lodging often provide a sense of home away from home, allowing you to unwind in comfort.

Create a flexible itinerary. Introverts thrive when they have the freedom to explore at their own pace. Design your travel plans to include leisurely activities like visiting museums, reading in beautiful parks, or enjoying coffee at local cafes. This will make each day enjoyable without the pressure of rigid schedules.

Pack a good book or download podcasts. Engaging with a novel or interesting audio content can provide comfort during travel. Having a source of entertainment can help you feel at ease in transit and even when dining alone.

Connect with like-minded travelers online. Utilize social media or travel forums to reach out to fellow introverts. Finding a travel buddy who respects your need for personal space can enhance the experience while still allowing for meaningful conversations.

With these elegant travel tips, introverts can embrace their unique travel style and create memorable experiences that resonate deeply within.

1ljqjzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ljqjzc/aitah_for_asking_for_a_break_from_my_partner/,AITAH for asking for a break from my partner,"Hi all,

I, F35, South Asian woman living in the UK. I don’t have family here and making friends in your 30s is harder than I imagined. My partner M42, British and I have been together for about 2.5 years and we live together.

This year has been emotionally heavy for both of us — but especially for him. Early in the year, our neighbour tragically died after overdosing on prescription medication. My partner was the first person to find him, and the experience left a deep impact on his mental and emotional wellbeing. Just two weeks later, his sister was hospitalised with a serious illness (she’s now slowly recovering). Two weeks after that, his grandmother — who basically raised him after his father left when he was 13 — passed away. They were very close. He’s never actually gone through therapy or proper support for the abandonment issues from when his dad left him, which I think still affects him deeply.

After all that, his GP signed him off work due to mental health issues. He’s been off since the start of the year. Since January, he’s been living with me, but hasn’t been able to contribute financially. In the first few months, I didn’t ask him to contribute — not because I didn’t need the support, but because I was raised to believe it’s common sense that someone contributes when they’re living in someone else’s home. I thought he’d bring it up himself. But he never did — not even once — so I eventually had to raise it. I created a spreadsheet showing what fair contribution would look like, and he agreed to it. But because he wasn’t earning and was only getting minimal support, he couldn’t follow through. He only just returned to work in the second week of June.

What really made things hard emotionally was how absent he became. He barely got out of bed. I felt like I was living with a ghost. Since the beginning of this year, the only times we’ve gone out together — for a walk, a coffee, or anything social — have been when I made the plans. It’s never come from him. I’ve carried the relationship practically and emotionally, and now I’m completely drained.

I try to be emotionally supportive for him, but sometimes it feels like I’ve lost myself in the process. Giving so much of my energy and care without getting much back has left me feeling empty and invisible.

My birthday came around recently — and just like last year, it was heartbreaking. I’m not someone who expects grand gestures. I didn’t even want a gift. All I hoped for was that he would come out of the bedroom, sit with me, talk to me, just be present — just once in the year, on my birthday. That didn’t happen. Last year he forgot to even wish me till after noon. This year, I had to order my own cake, light my own candle, and blow it out alone — while he sat in the other room. He didn’t say anything. Didn’t even come sit with me for a few minutes.

At one point in the evening, I confronted him and said, “This day has been really shit for me, and the way you’re treating me is horrible.” His only response was “F*** off.” I was so hurt and furious that I left the house around 10 p.m. and went for a really long walk. I walked nearly 10,000 steps over two hours and didn’t come back until close to 1 a.m. The worst part? He didn’t even text or call to check on me. It was like I didn’t exist.

This wasn’t even the first time I’ve felt completely unsupported. A few months ago, I was out walking alone and a man tried to pull me into his car. I was shaking when I got home and told my partner about it, and all he said was, “Yeah, this area isn’t great.” No concern, no comfort — just that. I felt so invisible.

I haven’t been sleeping in our bed for over a month now because he’s a very light sleeper and my snoring disturbs his sleep. I understood that — so I moved to the couch. But my back, neck, and shoulders are in constant pain now. And not once has he asked how I’m doing or suggested we find a solution. I just feel like a guest in my own home.

Despite all this, for his birthday I still made an effort — blew up balloons, put up decorations, got him gifts, and a greeting card (because last year he got upset that I didn’t get one, even though I had planned a whole day for him). This year, I didn’t do as much — maybe out of frustration — but I still tried to be there for him, even when I felt completely drained.

This isn’t the first time he hasn’t shown up for events that matter to me. He couldn’t come to my friend’s wedding abroad this year because he was sick — and I absolutely understood that. But this has happened before. Last year, he skipped another close friend’s wedding, saying it was too expensive. He also didn’t come to a wedding in my home country, again citing cost. I’ve started feeling like the people and moments that are important to me just don’t seem to matter to him.

This weekend, we had a silly argument that turned serious. We were at the beach and there was some confusion about which parking lot was closed. I insisted I was right and we made a jokey bet — loser cooks and cleans all week. I lost, and I jokingly said I’d cook what I wanted and he’d have to eat it. He took that personally and said it showed what kind of person I am, and called me petty. He said I was gaslighting him. It honestly crushed me. I didn’t think a light moment would lead to character assassination.

That Saturday passed. On Sunday, he got up late and ate at 4 p.m. I asked if I should start dinner later — he said I could start when I was hungry. I started cooking around 8:30 p.m. and we ended up eating at 10 p.m., because he was working on some DIY electrical stuff in the house and I lost track of time. He didn’t seem upset that evening, but apparently he was.

On Monday, he said he’d make himself a steak, and asked me to make a side. I don’t eat meat on Mondays for religious reasons, so I offered to make tamarind rice. He had previously said it wasn’t his favourite, but I thought that meant “I’ll eat it if it’s there,” not “I hate it and won’t eat it.” English isn’t my first language, and in my culture, we often say things like that to mean, “Not my favourite, but I’ll have it.” I only realised later he meant he genuinely disliked it. By then, I was already halfway through cooking. I offered to make something else, but he said no, he’d cook for himself. He didn’t.

Tonight, I wanted to make it up to him and cooked chicken fried rice and Gobi Manchurian. I told him in advance — and he said again that he’d cook for himself. I tried anyway, hoping he might eat with me. We eventually sat together and he said he was still upset about the beach incident. That I was petty. That it shows who I am.

And honestly, I just… broke.

I told him I think we need to take a break. That he should go stay with his grandparents for now. That I feel completely unseen in this relationship. Emotionally. Financially. Physically. I’m just tired. And his response? He said that shows what kind of person I am.

He has told me before that he never saw himself having a future — no house, no family, no dreams. It’s always been me who believed in all of that — a home, a family, maybe a dog. And now I feel like I’ve been pushing someone toward a dream that’s mine, not his.

I still love him deeply. That’s what makes this so painful.

But there’s one more thing I’ve been holding in:
I was meant to move back to my home country in 2024. I had made peace with leaving the UK and starting fresh. But I stayed — I got a skilled worker visa — just to see if this relationship had a real future. I chose this country because I thought we had a life to build together. But now, with everything going on, I can’t help but feel I gave up so much for something that feels so uncertain. I do love my life in the UK, but my home country has more comfort. It has people who would help me through hard times — family, familiarity, support. And sometimes, I wonder if I’ll ever find that level of connection here again.

Right now, I feel more alone in a relationship than I ever did single.

I don't think they ended meeting so she went back to trying to contact my mildly just No Step Mom.

The background if you don't want to read my post history is that DH and MIL were very emeshed. However DH also avoided her and I was a go between managing their relationship. MIL was a bottomless pit I could never make happy. Lots of manipulative, guilt tripping and passive aggressive behaviors. DH and both attended counseling and have been told MIL has emotionallyabused us. I suspect she has undiagnosed mental health issues. She herself has said he relationship with DH is an I healthy obession for her, that she made herself depressed worrying about whether or not they were close enough and got herself so worked up and anxious about she broke into hives. She refused to do counseling until after we went NC with her (now she claims she has a personal counselor). I had a traumatic birth and realized I was just an incubator to her and FIL and dropped the rope in August 2022. DH ended up going NC shortly afterwards in January 2023.

Since going NC MIL has shown up at a door and tapped a letter to it ""expressing her feelings at the advice of her counselor"", called DH, threatened to show up his job multiple times, called his client line at working hoping to catch him, emailed us, had FIL message a couple of times, show up at our house twice, various text messages, and leave presents at our door for LO. Despite her antics our leaves are much more peaceful without MIL. We have had a second baby and she is unaware of him (currently 5 months) as far as we know.

Most recently she happened to run into one of DH's ""friend"" (used to be a friend more of acquaintance now from high school) at the bank the friend worked at. It's possible this was a chance meeting or possible it wasn't. They made plans to get coffee. The friend told DH about it at a mutual friend's wedding.DH told him they had been NC for over 2 years and MIL was unaware of our second child. He said the friend said he was sorry to hear it and thought they might not meet.

This was a few weeks ago my step Mom showed me MIL had texted her. That she was ""just sick with worry about my son and his family"" and that she respected if step Mom wasn't able to answer.  My step Mom responded that obviously we were fine and they would contact them if there was an emergency. She said she didn't want to get involved in something that wasn't her business but she ""prayed for a reconciliation"".

I'm thankful my step Mom isn't giving her any real information. DH has also changed jobs and so MIL cannot call or show up at his work anymore. But I'm just so mad about her we'd tell you if it was an emergency. Like that's not your place. Also her I pray for reconciliation makes me mad. Like pray MIL gets some mental health help that's effective and she stops being toxic. I feel like MIL will never give up and step Mom will never agree with my choose either. Also MILs understanding if she can't answer (why couldn't step Mom answer her own phone). Both DH and I are capable of answering her it's just neither of us want to talk to her. MIL did not respond to step Mom.",24,1750808045.0,JUSTNOMIL,3,0.93,False

**Why the Generational Gap?**

* If you grew up debugging code, hand-drawing flowcharts, and feeding punch cards to mainframes, computers were stubborn, literal, and obviously non-human.
* BASIC was my “gateway drug” 10 PRINT “HELLO”; 20 GOTO 10 endless loops and not a hint of soul.
* Today’s AI is designed to sound empathetic and lifelike, but under the hood, it’s still just pattern-matching code. It’s gotten a lot better at hiding the seams, but it’s not “feeling” anything.
* For older users, there’s no temptation to anthropomorphize. We’ve seen the wires, the smoke, and the “SYNTAX ERROR” screens. We know the difference between a tool and a companion.
* For younger users, especially those whose first “computer” was a smartphone or chatbot, it’s a lot easier to project personality or even emotional depth onto the screen.                                            For the “old school” crowd: What was your first computer or programming language? (Anyone else lose an afternoon to a BASIC loop or floppy disk error?) Does it change how you see AI today?
* For younger users: Do you ever catch yourself thinking of ChatGPT as more than just a tool? If so, what helps you remember it’s just code?
* Bonus points for any “war stories” from the era of cassette drives, reel-to-reel tape, or hand-drawn flowcharts (coffee stains and ashtrays welcome!).
* How do you think this generational divide shapes debates about AI trust, safety, and expectations? From rectangles and diamonds on notebook paper, to just asking the oracle why your code won’t work—we’ve come a long way. Or have we?

I LITERALLY THOUGHT IT WAS ANYRHING ELSE ON THE PLANET BESIDES THIS MOISTURIZER .
i quit drinking coffee, quit drinking alcohol, changed my diet , changed my foundation and makeup brushes, changed my shampoo... and i was still persistent in breakouts and i've never experienced acne like this in my life. never had cheek acne either before this and now i have some hyperpigmentation on my cheeks (thankfully starting to slowly fade away with the passing months) but still, they do make me insecure. 

it was this moisturizer the whole time. i spent 8-9 months trying to diagnose the reason for my sudden adult acne •_• then i switched back to my previous moisturizer (cerave) and my skin purged a bit for like 2 weeks and BOOM. no more acne at all. not one pimple on my chin or cheeks , the redness and dry patches gone and back to normal.

I never thought I’d post something like this, but I’ve reached a point where I genuinely don’t know what to do anymore.
Sorry for the long post — I just really needed to get this all out. I really need some outside, human perspective.

I’m a 35-year-old South Asian woman living in the UK. I don’t have family here and making friends in your 30s is harder than I imagined. My partner (41M, British) and I have been together for about 2.5 years and we live together.

This year has been emotionally heavy for both of us — but especially for him. Early in the year, our neighbour tragically died after overdosing on prescription medication. My partner was the first person to find him, and the experience left a deep impact on his mental and emotional wellbeing. Just two weeks later, his sister was hospitalised with a serious illness (she’s now slowly recovering). Two weeks after that, his grandmother — who basically raised him after his father left when he was 13 — passed away. They were very close. He’s never actually gone through therapy or proper support for the abandonment issues from when his dad left him, which I think still affects him deeply.

After all that, his GP signed him off work due to mental health issues. He’s been off since the start of the year. Since January, he’s been living with me, but hasn’t been able to contribute financially. In the first few months, I didn’t ask him to contribute — not because I didn’t need the support, but because I was raised to believe it’s common sense that someone contributes when they’re living in someone else’s home. I thought he’d bring it up himself. But he never did — not even once — so I eventually had to raise it. I created a spreadsheet showing what fair contribution would look like, and he agreed to it. But because he wasn’t earning and was only getting minimal support, he couldn’t follow through. He only just returned to work in the second week of June.

What really made things hard emotionally was how absent he became. He barely got out of bed. I felt like I was living with a ghost. Since the beginning of this year, the only times we’ve gone out together — for a walk, a coffee, or anything social — have been when I made the plans. It’s never come from him. I’ve carried the relationship practically and emotionally, and now I’m completely drained.

I try to be emotionally supportive for him, but sometimes it feels like I’ve lost myself in the process. Giving so much of my energy and care without getting much back has left me feeling empty and invisible.

My birthday came around recently — and just like last year, it was heartbreaking. I’m not someone who expects grand gestures. I didn’t even want a gift. All I hoped for was that he would come out of the bedroom, sit with me, talk to me, just be present — just once in the year, on my birthday. That didn’t happen. Last year he forgot to even wish me till after noon. This year, I had to order my own cake, light my own candle, and blow it out alone — while he sat in the other room. He didn’t say anything. Didn’t even come sit with me for a few minutes.

At one point in the evening, I confronted him and said, “This day has been really shit for me, and the way you’re treating me is horrible.” His only response was “F*** off.” I was so hurt and furious that I left the house around 10 p.m. and went for a really long walk. I walked nearly 10,000 steps over two hours and didn’t come back until close to 1 a.m. The worst part? He didn’t even text or call to check on me. It was like I didn’t exist.

This wasn’t even the first time I’ve felt completely unsupported. A few months ago, I was out walking alone and a man tried to pull me into his car. I was shaking when I got home and told my partner about it, and all he said was, “Yeah, this area isn’t great.” No concern, no comfort — just that. I felt so invisible.

I haven’t been sleeping in our bed for over a month now because he’s a very light sleeper and my snoring disturbs his sleep. I understood that — so I moved to the couch. But my back, neck, and shoulders are in constant pain now. And not once has he asked how I’m doing or suggested we find a solution. I just feel like a guest in my own home.

Despite all this, for his birthday I still made an effort — blew up balloons, put up decorations, got him gifts, and a greeting card (because last year he got upset that I didn’t get one, even though I had planned a whole day for him). This year, I didn’t do as much — maybe out of frustration — but I still tried to be there for him, even when I felt completely drained.

This isn’t the first time he hasn’t shown up for events that matter to me. He couldn’t come to my friend’s wedding abroad this year because he was sick — and I absolutely understood that. But this has happened before. Last year, he skipped another close friend’s wedding, saying it was too expensive. He also didn’t come to a wedding in my home country, again citing cost. I’ve started feeling like the people and moments that are important to me just don’t seem to matter to him.

This weekend, we had a silly argument that turned serious. We were at the beach and there was some confusion about which parking lot was closed. I insisted I was right and we made a jokey bet — loser cooks and cleans all week. I lost, and I jokingly said I’d cook what I wanted and he’d have to eat it. He took that personally and said it showed what kind of person I am, and called me petty. He said I was gaslighting him. It honestly crushed me. I didn’t think a light moment would lead to character assassination.

That Saturday passed. On Sunday, he got up late and ate at 4 p.m. I asked if I should start dinner later — he said I could start when I was hungry. I started cooking around 8:30 p.m. and we ended up eating at 10 p.m., because he was working on some DIY electrical stuff in the house and I lost track of time. He didn’t seem upset that evening, but apparently he was.

On Monday, he said he’d make himself a steak, and asked me to make a side. I don’t eat meat on Mondays for religious reasons, so I offered to make tamarind rice. He had previously said it wasn’t his favourite, but I thought that meant “I’ll eat it if it’s there,” not “I hate it and won’t eat it.” English isn’t my first language, and in my culture, we often say things like that to mean, “Not my favourite, but I’ll have it.” I only realised later he meant he genuinely disliked it. By then, I was already halfway through cooking. I offered to make something else, but he said no, he’d cook for himself. He didn’t.

Tonight, I wanted to make it up to him and cooked chicken fried rice and Gobi Manchurian. I told him in advance — and he said again that he’d cook for himself. I tried anyway, hoping he might eat with me. We eventually sat together and he said he was still upset about the beach incident. That I was petty. That it shows who I am.

And honestly, I just… broke.

I told him I think we need to take a break. That he should go stay with his grandparents for now. That I feel completely unseen in this relationship. Emotionally. Financially. Physically. I’m just tired. And his response? He said that shows what kind of person I am.

He has told me before that he never saw himself having a future — no house, no family, no dreams. It’s always been me who believed in all of that — a home, a family, maybe a dog. And now I feel like I’ve been pushing someone toward a dream that’s mine, not his.

I still love him deeply. That’s what makes this so painful.

But there’s one more thing I’ve been holding in:
I was meant to move back to my home country in 2024. I had made peace with leaving the UK and starting fresh. But I stayed — I got a skilled worker visa — just to see if this relationship had a real future. I chose this country because I thought we had a life to build together. But now, with everything going on, I can’t help but feel I gave up so much for something that feels so uncertain. I do love my life in the UK, but my home country has more comfort. It has people who would help me through hard times — family, familiarity, support. And sometimes, I wonder if I’ll ever find that level of connection here again.

Right now, I feel more alone in a relationship than I ever did single.

1ljqcx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Otherwise_Meaning_82/comments/1ljqcx4/dating_advice/,Dating advice?,"

So to start, for a while I had given up on dating and relationships. It was just a disappointment and a letdown being constantly ghosted, or meeting people who lead you on but run away from commitment, etc. so for the past couple of years my mindset has shifted to I'm not actively looking for a relationship but I'm also not not looking for it either. If something comes along where I feel there's a connection that could lead to more I'm prepared to put the effort in.

So this leads to my story. 6 months ago this really hot guy that I met on Grindr came over for a hookup. He had on his profile a similar thing where he's not actively looking for a relationship but not opposed. Anyways, the sex was really good, I assumed it would just be a hookup nothing more and all was good...

After that, he kept messaging me to hang out and hook up which we did and it eventually started taking on a little bit more of a romantic twist. We were going on date nights and then he was coming back to my place to hook up after and sometimes staying over. And then it progressed to where we were hanging out, going on dates and spending time with each other without even hooking up. Every time he saw me even in public, he would kiss me, he would swing by my work place on my break and bring me coffee/snacks, we'd go on hikes with his dogs, he'd have me over his place and cook me dinner, etc.

Even though it wasn't spoken of it was clear that at this point there were some sort of feelings involved and it was more than just a hookup or friends with benefits but I didn't know where it was going... I didn't want to bring up the conversation at first because I didn't want it to seem like I was being pushy or trying to press a relationship but at the same time I wanted to know what his intentions were and what his end goal was And see if we were on the same page.

I finally got up the courage to have the conversation with him now at about 6 months in... What he told me was that it obviously started off as just to hook up and he had no intentions of anything more, but as we continued to hang out and hook up he saw my personality, what a good person I was and caught feelings and those feelings continued to grow for him as we continued to hang out. He wasn't expecting to catch feelings and for it to turn into this ongoing thing... He likes me a lot, enjoys getting to know me a little more each time we hangout and ultimately would like a committed relationship, but right now he has a lot of things in his life that he's trying to settle like financially, with his health and with his ex, family and stuff. Because of that, he doesn't think that he has 100% of his time to devote to me that he feels you should be able to devote to someone while building a romance/ committed relationship... He can see the potential for a relationship with me but isn't going to force it and drop all of the other things he's trying to settle. He'd rather just let it evolve naturally and slowly over time while he takes care of the other things he needs to do but told me that if I have a shorter time line and I'm looking to be in a committed relationship right now, he wouldn't fault me or blame me if I wanted to dial things back and just be friends while I put myself back on the dating market and see other people. He said either way I'm a great person and he wants me in his life in some capacity. 

Now, me that all sounds very legit and he does seem like he's being sincere when he's saying that. For me even though yes my life is at a point where I'm ready for a committed relationship now I still feel like why rush things. I don't have a timeline. So if his timeline is longer I'm willing to continue to build on whatever we already have going and let things about that way.

My friends however when I told them this said that he's just telling me what he thinks I want to hear. They think he's just giving me false hope and stringing me along, that has commitment issues and just wants the benefits of a relationship without the title. 

What is your thoughts on all this? Any suggestions of what I should do?

1ljq77e,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1ljq77e/these_waves_holy_hell/,"These waves, holy hell.","Day 115.

Last week, I felt like I was slowly coming to following the most brutal wave yet. I wasn't being life productive, but I was able to do some tasks and projects to help maintain a bit of sanity. I had a good support group meeting and therapy appointment, then for whatever reason, just as it seemed like I was about to get a sip of air, ***bam***, the next wave crashes in. Everything immediately escalates.

Every goddamn time, I even get a hint of the thought that says, *""you know, maybe there is at least some kind of a chance that things will be well enough in the future. Maybe I can get through this eventually,""* the next wave breaks the new levee, and the flooding resumes.

Once, when I was young, I almost got taken out by a tidal wave that came in while I was waist deep. It  knocked me down and dragged me all the way up the beach. I was underwater and I had to to the hardest pushup ever to get my head above water, and I had about 1 second to get a breath before my arms buckled and I had to start all over again. After several times doing this, I knew I had very few reps I had the strength left to do. In that moment, I pondered whether I should just let go and accept my fate. Luckily, I then managed to dig into the sand deep enough to stop my momentum and get back up. I was dragged probably 300ft up the shore. 

That memory has been resurfacing a lot lately, noticing the parallels to my hell right now, because that experience is a perfect metaphor for how a lot of this feels. Every time I think it's about to get a little easier, it gets harder than before, and I'm weaker than I was then. 

The PTSD has been beating the absolute shit out of me these last several days. It rocks me early in the morning and drains everything I've got right at the start of the day. I keep waking up earlier and earlier. I can't even make it to 7:00 AM before I'm dizzy from all the spinning, and I go running to the coffee shop so I'm not alone. Several times a day, the same thing happens, and I have to quickly think of somewhere to go because it's just crushingly brutal. I can't last more than 2 hours in the house or any one place without going through this. Most of the time, I'm in tears within 30 seconds of getting back home.

It keeps getting harder. I keep growing weaker. My body feels as though it's running out of energy, and at times, I'm amazed it still manages to drag one foot in front of the other.

Before anyone asks, I've been in  therapy for over 25 years, and I see my therapist regularly. I have support groups, a psychiatrist, and meds. I don't have close friends or relatives to lean on, or really any form of support, because all of that is in my wife's urn.

1ljq52j,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1ljq52j/are_my_symptoms_indicative_of_pregnancy/,Are my symptoms indicative of pregnancy?,"(I’m sorry in advance for this incredibly long post). I’m a young female who has struggled with PCOS since I was 13 years old. I’ve been experiencing a few symptoms recently and I can’t tell if they have to do with my hormonal imbalances worsening or if they’re pregnancy symptoms.

Despite my PCOS I have only ever missed a period for two months once, which is what led me to going to the doctor and getting diagnosed initially. My periods are very long and excruciating, typically lasting between 7-10 days with debilitating PMS that usually lasts up to two weeks. Because of this I think it’s fair to assume that my having missed a period last month is suspicious. I have still yet to get my period or experience my typical PMS symptoms but have instead developed a few others.

For starters, seemingly out of nowhere, I’ve developed an aversion to any pork product (as a Cuban-American my parents find this insulting). After my sudden aversion to pork came my occasional nausea that typically lasts from the time I wake up (6:00 a.m.) to 1:00 p.m. and then comes back around at about 4:00 p.m. and lasts until I go to sleep. I’ve experienced this nausea on and off for about two weeks now, but had yet to throw up until two days ago. I’ve also been experiencing body aches and swelling in my knees which is something I haven’t dealt with in about 7 years. To accompany my body aches and swollen joints was a new pain in my lower back that was aching and affected the way I slept. My body temperature has also been incredibly inconsistent, one second I feel like I’m boiling and the next I need to turn off all ACs and fans in my house. WARNING: this next section is very TMI. I’m not somebody who struggles with digestive issues typically, but in the past 3 weeks I started experiencing terrible constipation which has now turned into diarrhea. I’ve also been waking up bloated but it feels different then my previous bloating (doctors suspect that I could have Endometriosis- I have yet to be diagnosed but my bloating is typically more like painful swelling and this is very different from that). Now I myself typically drink an exorbitant amount of coffee on a daily basis and love everything that has to do with the art of coffee making and consuming, but today when my partner got in the car with his hot latte ready to go I nearly spewed. The scent was enough to make me gag so much so that I had to roll the windows down. TMI over!

Some other symptoms include increased acne, unstable moods/overly emotional (for example, I made a sexual joke to my partner that he laughed at and flattered him but I started sobbing because I didn’t want him to think I’m only sexually interested in him), extreme exhaustion/fatigue that again, could be a symptom of my hormonal imbalances worsening but seems unusual paired with these other symptoms. I’ve also felt “rounder” than before. When I gain weight it typically manifests in my arms or in rolls on my back but my stomach has suddenly become rounder around the bottom (near my pelvis) and I feel a stretching sensation on either side of my stomach. The last symptom, which is the one that led to me writing this post, is that I started smelling Play-Doh out of nowhere. There are no children around me and I haven’t seen or been near any Play-Doh since I was about 14 years old. I once heard of these kinds of things being potential pregnancy symptoms but regardless.

I didn’t notice him at first
just a flicker in my peripheral vision as my eyes scanned down the list of marks, my name sitting stubbornly in the middle again. But by the third exam, he had taken shape:
a boy made of pencil shavings and half-erased answers, lounging in the corner of my vision with a smirk that made my stomach twist.  

He doesn’t have a name, but he has my handwriting. When I press too hard on my pen during practice essays, his laughter echoes in the indentations left behind. ""Careful,"" he murmurs, tracing the paper cuts on my fingertips. ""All that effort, and for what?""  
He’s always watching. When the professor praises someone else’s work, he leans over my shoulder, his breath warm and sour like old coffee. ""You could’ve done that better,""  he whispers. ""You should’ve done that better."" His fingers dig into my collarbone, possessive.  
At night, he curls up in the hollow of my throat, his body fitted perfectly against the pulse point there. I feel him swallow every time I check my ranking online. He grows heavier with every mark I didn’t get, every compliment I wasn’t given.  
I try to ignore him. I highlight motivational quotes in my planner. I force myself to clap for others. But he just grins, wide and awful, and presses his thumb against the inside of my wrist where the veins show blue. ""Liar,"" he croons. ""You’re rotting with it. The unfairness. The rage. Let me taste.""

And God help me
I let him.  

Because when I wake up gasping at 3 AM, furious and shaking over some imagined slight, he’s the only one who understands. He wipes my tears with the edge of his sleeve (stained with ink, always stained with ink) and whispers, ""I know, I know, it should’ve been you,"" until the words carve grooves in my bones.  

The worst part?  

I think I love him.  

This sharp-toothed boy made of my own gnawing hunger.

I know this kind of post is posted often so I am not looking for regurgitated information but if you all have any advice specific to my situation, thatd be awesome.

Tomorrow is my first day as a volunteer and I'm a bit nervous. My shift is 6PM-6AM. This fire department is a small combo department but they're slowly phasing out volunteers so I'm grateful they took me on board. I passed their PAT and I have no certs but I will be trained eventually. 

I'll be the only woman at this department and the only volunteer on this shift schedule. Just curious if there's any tips especially when it comes to being the only woman. I kind of know what to expect in terms of attitude and dynamic. I'm definitely not there to sleep around and all that and although I don't have older brothers, I grew up around a lot of boys.

Besides showing up early, shutting up and listening, is there anything else that I should do? The captain has a really great attitude and thinks I'll do good so I'm excited. They did mention that Ill ride along so I'm assuming that'll happen tomorrow and I am assuming that I won't be really expected to do much. 

I know that I should get up first, clean up first, make coffee, etc. I'm worried about small things. I call everyone sir by default but should I say yes captain/chief when talking with them? And if no one is directly training me/giving me something to do, is it a good idea to always ask if I can help? I do plan on asking someone to teach me around the equipment if theyre not already planning it. 

Im wearing boots and pants I bought per recs on this sub. Theyre giving me a tshirt so Ill show up in uniform and a plain tshirt? I'm bringing hygiene stuff, blanket/pillow, lots of socks, shower stuff.. Anything else? Captain said he sleeps in a sleeping bag but he said I could bring sheets too. What do other people usually do?

I have good intentions but I'm worried I'll forget small things in the moment and that might make me look like I'm useless or something lol. I'm mostly just looking for reassurance that I'm not fucking up by existing.

I (40 yrs old) wanted to share where I'm at right now.  About 5 years ago I started to urinate a lot more than I usually do. I've always had what I thought was a small bladder, but now it was unbearable. I peed all the time. Went to a urologist who did all the tests and ultrasounds. Nothing was wrong apparently! I had gotten an iud (liletta) 1 year before that to help with my terrible cramps which I've had my whole life. I eliminated my cramps and periods on this which has been great. 

Fast forward to this past spring when I went in for my pap smear and they couldn't find my iud string. Got a transvaginal ultrasound to look for the lil guy and they reported fibroids. At least 2 are 6cm and they didn't measure the rest. They could barely see the iud due to the fibroids and my distorted uterus. 

So that was a month ago. I have an appointment with a fibroid specialist next week to develop a plan. Now that I know about them I can tell they are there. It's so weird! I'm excited to have a normal bladder again! I'm not attached to my uterus emotionally so I'm open to all possibilities! I'm mostly calm about the possibility of surgery. 

So far my symptoms seem to be: frequent urination, painful intercourse, bloating, and i recently developed acid reflux this year which I'm going to blame on the fibroids too. I've also been extremely fatigued for a few years, but quitting coffee helped even that out.

I'll update after I get my treatment plan!!

I’ve seen quite a few posts lately asking about life in Colorado Springs, so I wanted to share our experience in case it’s helpful for anyone else considering a move.

My husband and I moved to Colorado Springs about 10 months ago from Arizona with our two preschool-age kids. We had been thinking about it for a while, but finally made the move because the heat in Arizona just became too much, I couldn’t do another 120° summer. 

We’ve honestly LOVED it here.

 The weather:

Yes, winters bring some snow days, but they’ve been totally manageable. Most of the time, even after it snows, the sun comes out and melts it quickly. I’ve gone on runs in a short sleeve shirt just hours after it snowed. The sunshine here really makes a difference. Summers have been amazing, mostly in the 60s to 80s with just a handful of hotter days so far.

 Kid-friendliness:

This city is full of things to do with little ones. There are tons of toddler-friendly hikes, lakes, splash pads, and the libraries here are incredible. Most of them have full play areas inside! We’ve never run out of things to explore, and it’s been such a great place for our kids.

 Dog-friendliness:

So many restaurants and public places welcome dogs, which has been a big plus. It’s fun for our kids too because they love seeing dogs everywhere we go.

 Food scene:

Of course there are chains, but compared to where we came from (Phoenix area), there are so many amazing local spots. Great coffee shops, restaurants, and bars, and almost everywhere we’ve tried has been fantastic.

 Cost of living:

Totally depends on where you’re coming from. For us, it’s been comparable to Phoenix. Taxes are a little higher here, but it hasn’t felt like a huge adjustment. We’ve been living on one income with young kids and have found it very doable. Honestly, the quality of life here made it more than worth it.

 Housing:

There are a ton of homes for sale right now, everything from new builds and townhome communities to more established neighborhoods. We’ve noticed lots of new construction happening across the city. If you’re planning to visit, I’d recommend spending a few days driving around. Each area has a totally different vibe, and it’s worth exploring to see what feels like home.

Overall, we’re really happy we made the move. We love it here and don’t plan on leaving anytime soon!

If you’re considering moving here and have any questions about different areas, schools, fun stuff to do with kids, or just what to expect, I’d be happy to share what I know.

And if you ever want to check out homes while you’re visiting or just want to understand the market, I’m also a local REALTOR® and would love to help however I can.

Welcome (in advance)! It really is a great city to call home. ",1,1750806366.0,u_MadisonSellsCOS,0,1.0,False

They were laughing and talking and I was like omg, they're filming SATC to my daughter. She was confused because she obviously never watched it. I dragged her outside and the girls had gone into the trailer but SJP was still put front and going in. I said, im sorry to bother but can we get a picture with you? I couldn't help myself, this was peak SATC. She was very nice but said something like, oh yes but can you wait a bit? I ha e to finish my makeup.  I said okay and my daughter and I sat on the edge of sidewalk, in front of a small restaurant. We waited awhile. Like 15 minutes and I began to think we had been ghosted. I was in denials though and didn't want to leave yet. Then ,in front of everyone,  she pops her head out of the door and says, ready? You want to come in? We jumped up so excited!

1ljpskj,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ljpskj/aramse_sofi_brewer_first_cup/,Aramse SOFI Brewer: First Cup,"Who doesn't love novelty?! Another brewer arrived in the mail over lunch and I just had to try it out.

[\(Lots more pics at the end of the post.\)](https://preview.redd.it/gtp2k4p4gy8f1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=33ea23908f6994828d2c42643a2678a4394d549a)

Meet the Aramse SOFI brewer, a southern Indian style coffee brewer. It's quite a simple device, made of 3 pieces of stainless steel. The upper brew chamber has small homes in the bottom to allow coffee to drip into the cup below. But there are no filter papers here, so you end up with a cloudy coffee reminiscent of moka pot where the coffee oils and some fines can make their way into the cup, creating a heavier-bodied brew.

This brewer makes ***strong*** coffee compared to normal pourover. The brew ratio is only 6:1 water to coffee. And grind size is supposed to be espresso-fine, leading to a long draw-down time (in my case, about 8 minutes). So you extract a lot of flavor with a long, slow brew. To prevent over-extraction and extra-muddy cups, they tell you to pour your water into the brew chamber over a spoon for gentle pouring. In my case, I just used my Melodrip drip assist tool to achieve the same thing.

Details:

* Coffee: Stemma Coffee - El Arado from Finca Misericordia, Nicaragua
* Process: Red honey process
* Varietal: Caturra
* Dose: 20.0g
* Water: Rao-Perger recipe at 93°C
* Filter: none (the brewer does not require a filter)
* Brewer: Aramse SOFI + Melodrip brew assist device
   * Method: 2:1 pour and swirl + 1min bloom, Melodrip pour to 6:1 + swirl and sit until done
   * Total brew time: about 8 minutes
* Grind: 1Zpresso J-Ultra set to 0.8.5

Notes: Dark cherries and baking cocoa. Less acidity than this morning's cup with the Colum, but it almost has a slight juiciness to it. As it's cooling down, more acidity and bitterness seems to be creeping in. But it's definitely full-bodied and pretty smooth, even compared with an immersion brew. I'd put it on the order of the liquid portion of a medium or light roast espresso.

[Very cloudy brew!](https://preview.redd.it/y73wei69gy8f1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36b8431543746bfa103bd2d62746681dcf69222b)

It'll be very interesting to see how this brews different roast levels. But I have to be cautious I don't go too nuts and over-caffeinate.

Fit and finish on the brewer is pretty solid, which is good to see with how simple it is. The brushed finish is a bit on the coarser side of brushed texture, which will help hide fingerprints and make cleaning easy enough. The holes in the brew chamber seem to be clean. However, one issue I did note is a bit of a burr on the knurled pull on the cover. (See images for a close-up.) The edge rolled over and feels a little sharp-ish, but I don't think it would cut me. I will probably hit that lightly with a metal file to smooth it, though. All other edges seem to be deburred and rounded nicely.

As for cleaning, you basically have sludge in the brew chamber when you're done. But a quick flick of the wrist got most of it into my trash can, and I was able to rinse the rest out easily. I used a bottle brush and a drop or two of liquid soap to clean everything, which took only a few seconds to do.

It comes with components to assemble a WDT tool to remove clumps prior to brewing. The handle is 3D-printed plastic and seems to assemble pretty nicely. It should be durable enough unless you knock your gear around. It included 10 acupuncture needles, which you will need to blunt yourself when assembling. It also includes a silicone band for heat protection around the brew chamber as you touch it, but I didn't find I needed it. The top of the chamber was just warm for me. Lastly, the instruction pamphlet is clean, simple, and easy to understand, with details on what's included, how to assemble and clean everything, and brewing steps.

Overall, it's a nice, good-looking, solidly-built piece of gear that should last a very long time. I'd love to hear additional thoughts, as well as tips on using this brewer to extract (hah!) the most from it. 

EDIT: Also, just a couple of additional notes... The silicone band might be helpful if you want to preheat the brewer. Instructions didn't mention it, but maybe it would help for lighter roasts.

* **Outfit**:

   * Is a business casual toga a thing?
* **Accessories**:
   * Carries a large, leather-bound ""Coeus Codex"" binder—labeled “Standard Operating Procedures & Divine Best Practices.”
   * Maybe a coffee mug labeled “Ask Me About Your Firewall”.
* **Desk**:
   * Covered in scrolls repurposed as network diagrams, ancient tablets showing help desk ticket stats, and a crystal ball rebranded with an AI reference.
* **Setting**:
   * Cubicle walls with Post-it notes like:
      * “Tamed Chaos: Day 27”
      * “Do not disturb unless it’s a Tier 1 Oracle Error”
      * “Thinking. Loudly.”
