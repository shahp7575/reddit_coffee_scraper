Due to health issues, reselling recently became my sole source of income. Even though I really love and enjoy it, I'm hardcore struggling with motivation and consistency, 2 things I really need right now, ha!   
  
I've always done reselling entirely by myself, but I want that to change! I'm looking for a fun reselling community where we can be pals, share tips, and motivate each other. I'm so curious, has anyone found/created a community like that? Either in person or online? I'd really love some reselling friends to drink coffee with while we work on our listings etc. :) 

Thanks in advance, happy weekend! ",1,1729311066.0,reselling,0,1.0,False
1g70sv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1g70sv1/is_there_a_specific_type_of_dentist_for_figuring/,Is there a specific type of dentist for figuring out what is causing staining?,"I have been dealing with very persistent grey tooth staining for the past 3 years that appeared all of a sudden. I currently see my dentist 4 times a year for a cleaning, and within weeks the staining reappears. I've tried narrowing it down to dietary reasons, but nothing changed diet-wise in the first place to cause the staining so I'm at a loss. Don't smoke/drink coffee/wine etc., brush twice daily for probably too long cuz I never feel like my teeth are actually clean after 2 minutes.

My longtime dentist is clueless as to the cause and I'm looking for other options. I've been reluctant to go to another dentist and just be told to make sure I'm not smoking or whatever. Should I just try anyway, find a local university dentistry program, or some other option I'm not thinking of?",1,1729310912.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False
1g70sjs,https://i.redd.it/uvdm6eb31nvd1.jpeg,"Substrate, Spawn, Culture & Agar Recipes ","These are simple recipes that I use. I add peptone to all of the spawn recipes because peptone is a protein hydroxylate that is used to enhance the growth of mycelium but it's optional.

Let cool for a few hours or until the next day and make sure it's mixed well.

🔹 Spawn Recipe - Drippy Corn + Peptone

- 4 lb Popcorn
- 40 ml Karo Corn Syrup 
- 2 g Peptone
- 2.5 Quarts Distilled Water

Heat the water in your pressure cooker, and stir in the Karo and peptone. Add popcorn and PC for 30 minutes at 15 psi. Dump corn into a colander, strain out the water, and let cool for 30 minutes.

We exchanged a few messages and I felt that she's interesting so I sent a message suggesting we should continue the conversation over coffee in-person, which she agreed. I sent her my phone and we set up a date.

Turns out that she lives a lot further away than I thought but I figured should just follow through and go see her which I did. Drove about 2 hours and met up with her. She was definitely more beautiful in person and we had a nice vibe going. We talked about work, life, traveling, etc. and throughout all of this I didn't really get a chance to compliment her but she did very briefly during one of our discussions. 

We were also sitting outside and it was getting colder so I wasn't necessarily very comfortable but after we are we switched to indoor seating which was much more comfortable. We continued taking and throughout the night she seemed very engaged, interested based on her body language (leaning in) and the vibe was going good. I paid the bill then walked her back to her car and mentioned that it was nice to meet her and that we should remain in touch. 

After this I shared this with my friend and he highlighted the fact that I should've been more forward with my attraction towards her by making compliments and talking about previous relationships, what she's looking for in a partner, etc.

I texted her when I got back that I had a lot of fun and that she was very beautiful in person. I also expressed my attraction to her and that if she felt the same, I can schedule something for next week.

I would like some constructive feedback here on what I could do to improve going forward because I feel like I tend to have a hard time verbally expressing my emotions and feelings to people generally. I don't know if I get shy or afraid or what exactly but I just tend to keep it casual which ruins it I think.

1g70r5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1g70r5w/anyone_else_have_a_stubbornly_wrong_sense_of/,"Anyone else have a ""stubbornly wrong"" sense of direction? ","So I have a terrible sense of direction. Just in every way I'm bad at figuring out where to go. I get disoriented walking out of public bathrooms and don't know which direction to go to get back. I have a hard time with maps. Took me until I was like 16 to reliably be able to tell my left from my right, it's just bad. Obviously some sort of learning disability but never formally diagnosed. 

So last night I asked a friend somewhat rendomly to remember a room we had been in about an hour away and compare it to the room we were in last night. Like, which of the four walls was the sofa against, relative to the sofa we were in then. He didn't understand what I meant at first then when I continued to explain in different ways, he said that his internal feeling was that it was on the same wall as the one we were currently on. I was a bit surprised because I had the very distinct feeling it had been on the opposite wall. He seemed to mentally adjust his sense of direction so that he was always in the like, first person position like in a video game. I had an unshakable orientation of that room with the sofa facing a specific direction. I feel this way about everywhere. I have a firm sense of what direction my childhood home faced, and which direction we drove to get to the grocery store. Like I could stand anywhere and point to which direction. I have a strong sense of which direction my 1st grade classroom was oriented towds. The direction that coffee shop I went to that one time faced. 

These direction impressions are not based on anything real. Like I don't have a superhuman north/south/east/west sense or anything like that. If I have to change this perspective, like if I absolutely have to use a map or something, it takes a huge amount of mental effort to change this orientation, but it is possible. Me with maps is like Joey on Friends ""So I was in the map..."" 

You can probably see how the arbitrary direction impressions can mess me up. Like I leave a trailhead for a hike and then when I'm trying to find my way back, I'm like ""well it definitly feels like it was this way..."" 

So now I'm wondering if anyone else has this internal, stubbornly wrong fixed directional orientation. I never really considered that my problem is not that I don't have a sense or direction, but that I have an overly-inflexible one that is not based on reality in any way.

this is a long story but i rlly need advice because this girl is giving me so many mixed signals i'm at a loss...

CONTEXT:

i have a coworker that i've known for a good while now and i've recently started being more intentional with my interactions with her because i have developed feelings. she has given me a lot of signs that have indicated interest, so i began to reciprocate. 

some of her signs:

- initiating texting and having long text conversations (always replies in a timely manner)

- singing karaoke duets with me and mentioning wanting to sing with me 

- bringing up our inside jokes 

- giving small compliments about my clothes

- laughing at my jokes and talking to me a lot at work

- giving me rides and then pulling into a parking spot so we can talk longer in front of my house

etc...

sure some of these things can be harmless, but what really confused me is what happened last night. side note, this was our first time just hanging out 1 on 1. 

i invited her to go read with me at a coffee shop (around 7) and she agreed and didn't invite anyone else or try to bail. we ended up talking the whole time and laughing which was really great. we stayed at the shop until after they closed  (like 10-11pm) and we were the only 2 ppl left. we then went and got food and ate it in her car and talked. she took me home to drop me off and pulled into a spot so we could talk for longer. she also wore lipstick which she normally doesn't. i got home very late.

now this part is important. she told me last night that she had plans this evening while it came up in conversation. i didn't realize those plans were her going on a date with someone until tonight when she posted that she was on a date on her story. i am very confused because we just spent a great time together last night and she has alluded to being interested, yet went on a date still?

sure i understand that everyone has mixed opinions on exclusivity and there was never any clear communication on our hanging out being a date, but still it came off as she is not interested in me. 

at least for me, being interested in her, i wouldn't go on any dates personally with other women because i have found the one i want to get to know better, which is her. i believe i may have given mixed signals as well over time because i've tried to ""play the game"" and not wear my heart on my sleeve like i've mistakenly done in the past. i'm just overall very confused.

everyone is different in how they interact with friends, but i would not meet a friend who is a woman 1 on 1 too late in the evening, especially if it is our first time doing something like that. idk where to draw the line between what is friendly for her, and what is her being interested.

also she had her date scheduled in advance before i made a bold move to invite her to hangout last night, but i don't get why she would go on a date with someone else if she was interested in me. 

either way i'm going to tell her how i feel about her very soon because i know it's the best way to figure this stuff out. i would just love some feedback and also to hear if this has ever happened to anyone else.

Let’s introduce the cast of characters and hopefully make things clearer. 


There’s me and and my SO 


There is my cousin (1) their SO and their 2 children ranging in age from 7-9


My aunt 


My other cousin (2)


My other cousin (3) and his son who is 18


Cousin 2 and 3 are siblings 


We are all 40 and over. All have jobs except for the kids, the 18 year old and the aunt (who is retired)


We’ve decided to plan a family reunion for 4 nights 5 days. 


Cousin 2 paid $1500 for the cabin and left the planning and buying of food to me and cousin 1


Cousin 1 has not helped financially at all. 


That has left me and my SO to buy the food. Because I knew it would fall on us for several months now we’ve been buying food little by little when we buy our groceries. We estimate we will spend close to $1000 when it’s all said and done. 


We aren’t planning elaborate meals, but buying food for 10 people for 11 meals adds up. 


Cousin 2 is well aware cousin 1 isn’t helping with the food and that it’s just me and my SO paying. 


Cousin 2 continually reminds me that we have an 18 year old man coming and ‘he eats a lot’ and that we need to make sure we have enough for him. 


I explained I bought a package of 40 hamburger patties. Even if all 10 people eat 2 hamburgers a piece there will 20 hamburger patties left. I also said we’re planning on 5 pounds of ground beef for spaghetti and another 5 pounds for chili. There will also be sides like rice or salad or cornbread or garlic bread. I’ve planned like that for every meal. Plus there will be bread and peanut butter and jelly and cereal. 


I can’t imagine there won’t be left overs that he can eat if he gets hungry. 


He’s still insisting that’s not enough food and we should buy a couple of rotisserie chickens and cousin 3 suggested we buy ramen for his 18 year old son. 


Cousin 3 and his son haven’t not financially contributed even a penny towards this nor do they have plans to pay for anything. 


I’m flatly refusing to buy extra food and after the 10th text message I finally told cousin 2 that since cousin 3 and his son were getting a free vacation if the food provided isn’t enough then he can starve. I might have also called them moochers to have the gall to suggest foods that *I* could buy for them. 


So am I the asshole for being stubborn and refusing to buy something as cheap as ramen?


**VERDICT: NOT THE ASSHOLE**


[Update 1 - The entitlement just continues to grow. Family member that hasn’t contributed wants to invite another family to join us.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/yzctpz/the_entitlement_just_continues_to_grow_family/)   **Nov 19, 2022**


You can see my post history for a recap of what’s going on and what I’m complaining about. 


Short recap:


We’re going to a cabin in the woods for vacation. It’s a family trip with extended family. Several cousins, a couple of kids, an aunt and a SO. 


One cousin paid for the cabin and left the planning and buying meals to me and another cousin. 


The other cousin has not helped buy anything. Literally nothing. We’re talking probably close to 1k of food bought and he hasn’t paid not one penny. Won’t Venmo me money, won’t buy stuff on his own. Constant excuses. 


Last night he messaged me and the cousin that paid for the cabin and said he wanted to invite more people. 


The cousin that paid for the cabin said no, was actually polite about it (I’ve seen the texts) and the one who hasn’t contributed a dime is now flipping out because he was told no. 


I’m just dumbfounded at this point. I don’t have a lot of family left, that’s why I was biting my tongue about the ones not paying towards this trip but I’m just shocked that someone who hasn’t contributed a dime to a trip thinks they can invite 4 other people and gets upset when told no!


[Update 2 - Entitled cousin wants to invite people to our family reunion even though he hasn’t contributed financially](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/z6eetk/update_entitled_cousin_wants_to_invite_people_to/)  **Nov 27, 2022**


I was asked to give an update and I’ve gotten a decent following so here’s your update (would love to know where my followers came from) 


Our weekend is almost over, the last of the family leaves tomorrow so I figured now would be a great time to give you guys the update. 


Quick recap for those that don’t want to click on my post history to read the backstory.  Cousins had a great idea to do a family reunion over thanksgiving in a cabin in the woods.  Not everyone was pulling their weight financially and then one wanted to invite extra people.  Said person got a bit butt hurt when he was told no. 


Well, the cousin that wanted to bring extra people did not bring them. And he actually bought groceries. There was a group list going and he stopped before he got to the cabin and bought everything that was on the list that hadn’t been bought yet.  Then 2 days later we had to make a grocery run for more food (several people had the munchies) and that was a decent bill and he paid that.  He also helped with the cooking and cleaning. So in my eyes he pulled his own weight. 


The cousin that brought his brother and nephew. They spent the entire time high and drunk. But they weren’t annoying. So while I personally don’t see the point of what they did I’m not gonna complain.  Plus we’d wake up in the morning and he always made something like cookies or prepped food for the day. And he was great at emptying and refilling the dishwasher. 


Only one kid came, we had a blast with said kid. 


My SO had fun as well. 


For me, I was pleasantly surprised. I had a great time and it was really neat to see my daddy in my cousins. From mannerisms, to facial features, to the one cousin who is covered in fur from head to toe.  It’s been hard on me since my dad died and for reason that would fill a book I didn’t grow up with this side of the family. So I had a great time reconnecting with them. 


We had a family meeting where we came up with a budget and how much each person needed to contribute to keep this thing going. 


The plan is to do the same next year, I’m supposed to call tomorrow to see about reserving the cabin for next year.


[Update 3 - entitled cousin wants to invite people to our family thanksgiving CRUISE EDITION](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/zh2bjk/3rd_update_entitled_cousin_wants_to_invite_people/)   **Dec 9, 2022**


I seem to have a decent following and responses from my last 2 posts so I figured I’d give you guys another update. 


We are trying to make this a yearly tradition. We’ve gotten together the last 2 years and no one has killed someone so we’re trying for a 3rd time.  On a cruise ship this time *ominous music plays*


The place we stayed at the last 2 times doesn’t have any openings for the next 2 years so after trying airbnbs that charge a heck of a lot for a place big enough for us I finally say screw it we’re looking at cruises. 


And wouldn’t you know there’s a fairly cheap one that aligns with the dates we can go. 


Somehow it all fell on me to organize it. 


And it’s like herding cats.


I need specific info from each person going. And we’re up to 10 people. And group emails and texts go unanswered so I have to individually harass each person to get very basic info like birthdates, full names, and email addresses. 


Finally gave an ultimatum that worked. Give me your info today or you’re not going. And finally, miraculously I got everyone’s info. I’m so impressed with myself I’m going to reward myself with a nice margarita tonight, or maybe something stronger. 


We’ve divided the cabins up basically by households. If you live with or came out of the body of a specific someone that’s who you’re gonna be in a cabin with. 


*And this is the part you guys are waiting for. The entitled person aspect to this, and why I decided to give this update.*


I chose the cheapest cabins for all but one cabin. The more expensive cabin will entirely be paid for by the people occupying it. 


One of the cheap cabins may not get to go.  No one else is footing the bill.  Those two people occupying it are responsible for their portion. If they can’t pay, they don’t go and no one else is penalized.


They know this. They have 10 months to come up with the price of their cabin. It will be a struggle.  The struggle is entirely due to poor financial management. 


One of the persons in the cabin who may not get to go is asking to switch roommates and cabins with the more expensive cabin! The same person that did not contribute ANYTHING to the last reunion. Not even cleaning up, cooking, organizing. Nadda. And they think they are going to weasel their way into a free cruise. 


Not gonna happen.


Edit: 


I’ll keep giving updates as long as people want to hear about my crazy family.  I imagine I won’t have another update until the final payment is due, and that’s not till August. 


[Update 4 - The update I promised, cruise edition.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/NbENBaBMJs)  **Sept 10, 2023** 

I have a surprising amount of followers and I promised to update once the cruise had to be paid for and so here we are. It’s going to be a short update, because we haven’t gone on the cruise yet.  

Once we get back from the cruise I’ll update again. 

Feel free to click my name and read through my previous posts. 

And yes, I read the criticism about using numbers rather than fake names. So I’ll just be vaguer and not mention numbers.  

It was a mess getting all the info needed to book the cabins but we did. 

The entitled aunt tried to switch rooms with someone else who has a suite, while only paying the inside cabin rate. That was shot down immediately. 

One cabin fell through so those 2 will not be joining us. There was a break up and then the other person couldn’t afford to pay for the cruise. 

Everyone else is paid for, and everyone paid for their own cabin! It did come down to literally the last moment.  I expected the entitled aunt to have to drop out but she somehow found the money. 

All but one cabin has bought the drink package. The cabin that can’t afford to buy the drink package thinks they can buy wine, pour it out and fill it with something stronger. We shall see if that is smuggled onboard.  Feel free to take bets on that. 

Another cabin wants to smuggle pot on board even though they are well aware of the drug dogs at the port. That cabin plans to vacuum seal it. Feel free to take bets on if that cabin gets caught. 

My cabin will get on that ship whether the others do or not. And I plan to spend the majority of the cruise drunk if the others do actually make it on board. M 

Thinking of getting everyone yeti cups, or maybe a tote bag with some sort of phrase to commemorate this years family vacation. 

[Update 5 - One last update before the family cruise. This is another segment of the entitled cousin saga](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/5y39tDlSG7)  **Oct 31, 2023** 

Since I have a following I thought I’d give yall another update. 

Ya know that phrase you’re a glutton for punishment? Well yeah. That’s me. 

So one thing I purposely failed to mention in my other posts is that I have another vacation planned for my SO and I right before we go on this cruise. As in we come home, have about enough time to wash clothes and repack before we have to leave to go on the cruise. Ohh and didn’t I mention the first vacation is overseas so it takes a bit more planning than a US vacation??? 

We leave in a few days for that vacation. I’m also still working 45+ hours a week up until the day we leave so I don’t have a lot of time to devote to the cruise. I’ve made that clear to everyone going on the cruise. 

Since we’re a bit less than a month from the cruise we can check in and I’m trying to coordinate that with everyone and having a tough time doing that. Texts go unanswered. 

I’m to the point I simply don’t care any longer. I checked my SO and I in and that’s it. I have spent a week trying to coordinate times since we are supposed to carpool there. But I’m done trying to get people to answer my fucking texts. 

And here’s where you guys that have read this far are looking for. The juicy stuff. The drama stuff. 

Back when we planned this cruise everyone told me they had a passport. I thought that was the end of that. I didn’t think I needed to investigate further into that. Unfortunately I should have. 

So I explained to one how to check in online and mentioned having your passport handy so you can enter that info. 

Said person then takes that moment to inform me that their passport is expired.  They also have no clue where their birth certificate is. 

At this point said person may not be getting on the cruise. Luckily for them they live in the state they were born in and the state capital is just a few hours from their home. So I sent them a link to set up an appointment in person to get their birth certificate. 

I have not followed up with them to find out if they made the appointment or found their birth certificate. 

I’m officially done for this year trying to corral everything. I have gone above and beyond for a freaking year now and I have no fucks left to give. 

Who wants to take bets on if the one with the expired passport gets on the ship? 

[Update 6 - I’m back with another update! Family cruise edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/G8Mdfx5zuw)  **Nov 27, 2023**


Please see my profile for my other posts about my absolutely delightful family and our yearly vacation. 

Last I left you guys my SO and I were gearing up for an overseas trip, coming home and then almost immediately going on this family cruise. 

Well we are back from both so now it’s time for the updates! 

Our trip overseas was amazing, we got to spend time at a hotel that has amazing views of Mount Fuji and we stayed at a Ryoken with our own private hot spring! Absolutely amazing and picture perfect and we will be going back. 

We got home, I had about enough time to wash clothes and repack before we got on the boat. 

So all of us live in the same state, some closer than others. The ones that live about 10 hours away started out Tuesday and spent the night in my town so we could carpool to the cruise terminal. 

The ones that live about 5 hours away decided to drive down the day of. They headed out about 4 am thanksgiving day and met us at a place open thanksgiving day. 

And that’s when they dropped the bomb on us. 

One of the persons in their party did not remember to pack their passport and they didn’t have their birth certificate. Yes. It is the same group that I mentioned before whose passport was expired.  Same group, different person.  That person, miraculously, found their birth certificate so they were golden. 

We drive down to the cruise terminal, help everyone with their luggage and boy was there a lot of luggage! And one went to ask about the whole passport situation. He came back to let us know that the person that forgot their passport absolutely would not be allowed on the cruise. Said person had every opportunity to upload their passport ahead of time, and had they done that they would have been allowed to sail. But nope. Said person did not do it.  So we watched 2 from our group board the bus back to the parking lot to retrieve their vehicle and head home. No temper tantrums, no blaming me, at least not yet. 

They are trying to get future cruise credit for their missed cruise but it’s not looking good. 

The rest of us got on the ship.  And that’s where the fun began. 

All of us have been on cruises before so we knew what to expect but nothing prepared us for this trip. 

This was a 5 day cruise on a small older ship that wasn’t laid out very well. Especially in a post Covid world. 

People had no concept of personal space anywhere. Not on the elevators, not in line for the buffet, not in line for coffee, not sitting at a table.  

They also had no concept of cleaning up after themselves or even flushing a friggen toilet. Plates of half eaten food in the stairwells next to the art pieces. Half drunk drinks all over the railings. Dirty tissues in the elevators.  

People, adults and kids, not covering their mouths when they sneeze or cough.  Had a kid that looked to be about 7 cough directly on my arm and mom didn’t apologize or even say anything to her heathen. 

Watched a lady smack the absolute shit out of another lady right by the service desk and they did nothing.  For a moment I thought we were at Walmart. 

This was not the experience any of us has had on past cruises so it was a total surprise to us. 

And on to only bit of family drama that actually made it on the ship.  The one cousin that planned to bring edibles did apparently bring them and decided to eat one or two gummies and also literally drink all night long and into the morning of embarkation while not sleeping the last night we were on the ship. 

Made for a not pleasant embarkation trying to track his ass down to get off the ship.  


And I’m already planning the next family cruise! Hopefully people will be more prepared for the next cruise….. 

[I’m back with a sorta update to my entitled family saga](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/JuhjtbdwW1)  **March 5, 2024** 

So I want to clear a few things up since my posts make it to update group and people there have questions. 

Yes I address my followers because, surprisingly, I have 529 followers as of right now.  And as long as people want to know I don’t mind letting you guys see a glimpse into my life.  And yep I’m just as shocked as some of you that people are following my crazy family. Yall really should let me tell you about the other side of my family, that ones got murderers and all. It’s def a lot more interesting than this side of my family. 

Now onto money questions. My SO and I don’t have kids and we’re a bit older, so we have a lot of disposable income. When I bitch about paying for others it’s because those people feel entitled to my (and others) money. Those people have always been like that and I don’t play into their games. They are not rich, and I always take that into consideration before booking any family vacation but they truly feel they are entitled to go and not pay. It’s not a question of being too poor to go and everything to do with making poor financial decisions and expecting others to pay for their vacation.  When we did the cabin I was perfectly okay with paying a larger share of the food if the ones that didn’t pay anything contributed in other ways. Like cooking or cleaning. They didn’t. They either sat on their rear end complaining they needed a money tree or drank themselves drunk the entire time. When I would say “hey I need you to make this” and literally hand them everything they needed to make it they would feign ignorance and then proceeded to purposely fuck up the food I gave them in hopes of getting out of future things. 

I don’t play those games. 

That’s why we decided a cruise for Thanksgiving. That way everyone paid their fair share, the two people who aren’t as flush with money were asked before I booked if they could afford it. They both said yes. And they were given 9 months to come up with less than $500 a piece.  Well no, that’s incorrect. They had 9 months to come up with $125 all together. 

One conveniently left out that they had booked a cruise for after our cabin family vacation…yes the same vacation said person said they couldn’t afford to help pay for.  They paid $1200 for the cruise and then couldn’t go so they had a credit with the cruise line that covered 2 peoples cruise minus taxes and port fees, that $125 figure. Yes. There is a discrepancy in how much was paid and what they owed. You, apparently, can’t use future cruise credit for port fees and taxes. 

They did struggle to come up with the $125 but again it was because of poor financial choices.  They aren’t required to come and I do talk to them before booking anything to make sure they can afford it. I don’t just assume they can and book it. I ask, I go over the details and once I get a yes then I proceed. 

Also, because some people didn’t know this. Cruises can be cheap. We booked inside cabins and for 2 people for 5 days it was $500 per person. So about $100 a day. That includes meals.  

There were some questions about my private vacations that don’t include my family. We book years in advance. Years. 2024 and 2025 are already booked and if my SO would ‘let me’ I’d have booked 2026 too! There was 5 days between when we landed back home and when we had to be on the cruise ship. And in that time frame my SO and I still had to work 3 of those days. I also work 9-10 hours days and have about a 3 hour round trip commute each day. That’s what I meant when I said we only had about enough time to wash clothes and repack.  

We are able to get decent deals on our vacations because we book far in advance, Japan cost us about 10 grand all together for 2 weeks including airfare. We started in Tokyo and made our way across the country. We went to Kyoto, takyama, we got to see Mount Fuji, Hiroshima and just so many awesome things. For that we hired an excellent travel agent who got us great deals on hotels, attractions and tour guides. 

Now onto the sorta update. 

One person told me that financially they are struggling and couldn’t afford a family vacation, and I believe them. So I suggested we go up to where they live this year. That saves them from hotel rooms and gas and then they only have to come up with activities and meals. They agreed, said that was an excellent idea.  I then spoke to the others and they flatly refused the idea. They want a cruise. Cruise doesn’t work for two of the people and I told them that. Their response is that 2 poorest people shouldn’t dictate the rest.  I disagree. I have no issue working around peoples finances so that we can include everyone.  So we’re at an impasse. I gave everyone till January 15th to figure out what we were doing and that deadline came and went with no communication. So I booked a second vacation for my SO and I for Christmas. We’ve now ‘used’ up all of our vacation time and I have nothing left over for the family vacation. 

In the last 2 weeks the one that flatly refused anything but a cruise is trying to figure out something. They’ve suggested going to Vegas, or Louisiana, or Biloxi. I’ve said each time that they need to speak to the one who told me they couldn’t afford it and see what they say first.  I’m not helping or planning anything.  So that’s where we stand now.  It does not look promising for a family vacation this year at all. BUT if it miraculously happens I will gladly update you guys, if you want an update. 

##**NEW UPDATE**
* 

[2024 update](https://www.reddit.com/u/UnlikelyCatHerder/s/f2WlbSZl7z)  **Oct 12, 2024** 

There’s 686 people who apparently wanna know about my crazy family so I figured now’s about time to give another update. 

No family get together this year. 

I tried to organize something but things just didn’t work out 

Some couldn’t afford a cruise, the camp we stayed at last time books up years in advance plus again, money is an issue. 

I looked into casinos, because at one time they used to offer cheap hotel rooms and we are close enough to casinos to make that an option. The problem is the rooms aren’t cheap any more. And again. Money. 

I suggested we rent hotel rooms in the town that the family that can’t afford anything lives but that was shot down because some didn’t want to go there. And to be perfectly honest I don’t blame the ones who shot that down. Who wants to go to Dallas for a vacation? 

So I gave up trying to figure things out. 

I got several late night drunk/or maybe high on ambian texts from my aunt wanting to know prices for the cruise and after I told her the prices she quit texting me about it. 

Hubby and I leave in a few days for a nice 2 week vacation to Greece, and then we come home and we close on a brand new home and then a few weeks later head off to another vacation in mexico for Christmas. 

When we dont have to finance others vacations we can afford more of our own. 

Our new home will be big enough to host my family but I’m not sure if that will happen. We are moving out in the middle of nowhere but in a neighborhood and I just don’t think I want to subject neighbors to my family.  My husband is on board with it, he’s a saint, but we shall see how things go next year before deciding to host my family.

1g70iex,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g70iex/is_he_flirting/,Is he flirting?,"I (23F) recently started talking again with a guy (25?M) I met at a guitar store last year. He works at the guitar store and helped me find my first electric guitar. The entire time, he was getting guitars for me so I didn’t have to get up, plugging it in the amp, and would show off by playing complex riffs before handing it to me, and was super helpful. He also threw in a bunch of free stuff, but maybe that was bc it was my birthday. Anyway, I was immediately attracted to him.

Since then, we haven’t met in person, but have been in communication online. He once told me that the color I was wearing looked great on me. To me that seems like flirting. But that was back in April, and we didn’t talk again until earlier this week. (I was in a relationship and when my (now) ex saw the message about the color looking good on me, he made me unfollow him. I’m no longer with my (now) ex, hence why I refollowed guitar guy and reached out to apologize for unfollowing.) 

We’ve been talking every day since, and it’s all been pleasant and platonic, but I just keep getting flirty vibes. I could just be projecting what I want him to feel onto his words though. I ended up taking an online guitar lesson from him and I was super nervous, but it went well. We ended up going over the time, but he said it was okay. He kept saying I was awesome (seemed unrelated to my guitar playing), that I did really well, and I’m a quick learner. I don’t need guitar lessons to learn how to play, just to improve. When we finished, he said that he was sorry to hear about my breakup, but I told him it was no big deal. Right after that, he said “but I’m glad we’re in contact again, vibing, and playing guitar.” I’m not sure if he was flirting, or just shifting the topic so that things wouldn’t be awkward. Then, he invited me to meet his band at this local event for musicians. He was gonna be at the thing anyway, and he’s most likely trying to build an audience for his new band, so I can’t figure out if it was something he’d offer to any other person he gives lessons to or not. 

But we’re going to be doing lessons every week. I would prefer to do them in person, but I live over an hour away and I don’t have my license, only my permit. But anyway, he ended the lesson with casual conversation and he once again said that if I ever needed anything, whether a guitar question, or just want to talk about my day, he was happy to talk with me. He’s said that a couple times when messaging me, that he was always available if I wanted to talk about anything.

To try and get some answers, I posted a lil thirst trap to my story. It was pretty obviously a thirst trap. He liked it, but didn’t reply. A different guy that recently slid into my dms liked it AND replied with heart eyes. That felt more obvious, so it makes me wonder if guitar guy just liked it to be nice, or as a friend hyping me up.

BUT… he’s been posting pics on his story of his coffee, but both times, there’s been another cup, and this most recent time, there were long-ish fingernails (no polish that I could see). However, he hasn’t tagged anyone in the posts, nor posted a picture of anyone’s face. He isn’t tagged in any pictures with girls either. Idk if he has any siblings, roommates, or friends that are girls. I guess I should learn more about him before trying to ask him out, but family doesn’t really come up when we’re talking.

Part of me worries that he could just be flirting with me to get me to pay for lessons. He’s a musician and plays a lot of gigs, so I’m sure he has natural charisma from that. He sent me a selfie while chatting with me for seemingly no reason, so that made me think it was flirty. I’m contemplating  saying something like “i might be overthinking it, but are you flirting with me a little bit?” But if the answer is no, I don’t think I could handle the embarrassment of continuing to take guitar lessons, but I don’t want it to seem like I stopped  BECAUSE he doesn’t like me back.

Basically, pls give me advice. Also, I apologize for being so wordy. I’m a pretty anxious person and I’m not very good at explaining things in short terms. I know I should probably just wait and feel things out, but I have such a crush on this guy and I don’t want to wait too long bc he could definitely find someone else.",1,1729309865.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

But, when I absolutely destroy some chicken wings I get no problems or very little problems. What would be the easiest way to tell if I have a histamine issue? I have struggled for decades with a condition called Aquagenic pruritus ( itchy skin with water contact ) and I remember reading there is a mast cell activation with this disease. I went keto decades ago and that helped quite a bit, but it never solved the issue. Thankfully I found out years ago in a forum that many had some relief of the itch by finishing their shower with very hot water. I have been doing that for years and I just deal with this. I don't think much about it these days, I'm numb to it.

Fast forward now, and my digestion just really sucks. When I want to fill up on fatty meat I hit a limit and then my night is ruined with belching, discomfort and sometimes reflux. My heart rate will go up considerably and I feel out of breath when this occurs. I had an upper GI a few years ago and everything was ok, but they noticed some inflammation. 

But, Like tonight, I went out for wings. Ate until I was full ( about 12 wings ) and I had virtually zero digestion problems.

So is it fat, or histamine issue. Is there something that I can eat for 5 days that is low histamine but fatty that could give me some clues?",1,1729309143.0,CarnivoresWithHI,0,1.0,False

Until then, I must outlet my brooding insanity before I hit the road. I at least hope it's relatable to somebody out there. 

First off, the TV is hooked up to what must be what Best Buy sold as the universe and beyond's loudest soundbar to have ever been developed. Didn't know Wheel of Fortune had a bass track? Well, you're in luck -- if you're within approximately 1.2 mil miles of my current location, I'm sure you can hear the radiant thump of the wheel and the piercing ding of the letters.

Any extraterrestrial beings flying by at 1.2T light years across 25 interdimensional planes can surely hear the neverending commercials for prescription med class action lawsuits and Empire Carpet thumping away.

God fucking forbid you fucks sit alone with your thoughts, your soul, and the essence of who you are, for more than 0.00001 seconds. Might just spontaneously combust.

It's truly confusing to me that these psychos can't turn their fucking TV off for a few hours when they have a guest?  

I can almooost deal with the TV on volume 583838484833 on its own... but then they start nagging each other. Ok.... but neither of them can hear fucking shit!!!!! 

###""WHERE'S THE FUCKING SPATULA""
##""WHAT?""
#""FOR FUCKS SAKE I'LL JUST FIND IT MY FUCKING SELF""

There are now *3* separate dialogues of **extreme volume** occurring at once while I close my eyes and dissociate, reminding myself that this is only my biggest trigger in the entire world and it's totally okay.

They, of course, can't hear the TV at all? N-mom gets mad that n-dad can't hear her screaming to him about whatever pointless unnecessary bullshit over the theme to Shark Tank.

Escalation occurs.

N-mom starts screaming **nevermind**!!!!! **you never listen**!!!!... then storms away.

Problem solved? Now I can try to watch Jeopardy with Dad on volume 58384838384. Mom definitely won't be lurking around the corner waiting to become insanely jealous that her child wants to spend time with dad.

Oh! There she is, imagine that -- she never left. Time to go huff and puff, and **slam** all the cupboards, and **slam** and run the dishwasher, and **slam** the plates, and make coffee and **slam** the glass carafe and **grind the beans**.

Time for Final Jeopardy? That's cute, mom has something more important to say. 

God, it's not like any particularly abusive or enraging thing happened but as someone who has misophonia (wonder why...) and ADHD/neurodivergence I think I'm gonna have to set some ground rules from here on out. This shit kills me.

Ok, that's all -- thanks so much for listening to my rant if you made it one word or the whole thing, and hopefully all of us can have the strength to walk away from this sort of crap if we haven't yet fully given up on these damned boomers.",1,1729308927.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,0.67,False

Before you go through this post it is highly recommended you read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1g4k6gp/comment/ls47mzx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) comment and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1fmlz89/retention_benefits_are_inexplicable_scientifically/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) post.

To the mods: I am aware that the terminology might infringe the guidelines of this subreddit, even so, I feel what I am about to write is for the greater benefit the community. Humor me and Kindly do not take the post down. I did my best to steer away from the more commonly used vocabulary that is looked down upon in r/Semenretention

# INTRODUCTION

This is NOT a post but a legit 'How To' technique I used for retention. I am not responsible if you hurt yourself doing what I did. The risk is your own to take.

I will be listing the techniques, methods I used and my psychological approach to SR on what I call Ultra Hard Monk Mode.

I took cold showers everyday. Summers, Winters it did not matter. I did it even when I was sick I did not skip one single day. I woke up between 4AM to 6AM without skipping a day again.

Gym every single day for the last 8 months. Yes no rest days. Rest days are a scam. I would take Active rest days BUT STILL GO TO THE GYM. You will see in my Apple fitness profile below that I took some days off. No I didn't. I just forgot my watch at home sometimes the battery was too low.

I stopped scrolling, no social media, no games, no dopamine consumption in any form. All I would do is either exercise in the gym or work toward my goals. My meals mainly consisted of vegetarian food(No eggs or milk) because carnivore diet amplifies sexual desire. I would eat chicken once in a month or so if someone in the family cooked it for me. I had absolutely NO pleasure outlet. This was not easy to be honest. Hardest 8 months of my life But also my fondest memories with me and me alone. These past 8 months have changed me, transformed me. Changed my identity and my core. I feel like everything I write has improved a lot, the content, the delivery. My intellect has changed, my body has changed, my will power has changed. But a lot of work is still pending. I am still changing, this is not the end.

***""The Devil cannot make hell look beautiful, so he made the roads that lead there heavenly.""***

This is essentially what I did on repeat. Grinded on Ultra Hard Mode. Gave it my 75%. Still am not able to give it my 100%. There is still some things I can go 110% on - like deleting my reddit, insta account etc. I might do that eventually.

You don't have to follow me. I am not telling you to follow me. I will however, give you an exact breakdown on how to do this. Whether you want to do this or not depends on you. ANYONE CAN DO IT. THIS IS NOT A ME POST. I am not a genetic freak. There are people in the world who have done it better and faster than me. It was only and only possible due to CLEAN retention and MENTAL CELIBACY.

If you follow this guide to the best of your ability, I promise you, you will create an absolute Behemoth of a monster inside you. You will gain a WILL Power so unyielding, impregnable that people will not only not recognize you but some will even bow down before you. Some will call you crazy, some will become jealous of you, some will have no choice but be attracted to you. Such is the power of an unbending resolve. You will literally be a Superhuman.

***""Your urge to have sex with people is holding you back from everything you have ever dreamed of""***

# RECEIPTS

However, I will not talk big WITHOUT receipts. Here's some photos and videos to back up my claims.

I started on the 8th of Feb and have been consistent for around 7[ months ](https://imgur.com/rukVxMm)now. I started at [223lbs](https://imgur.com/d8qUKlf) at around 37% body-fat %age and after 4 months at the time of [this picture](https://imgur.com/ymhW5aA) I was at 22%ish body-fat %age. I am wearing the same T-shirt in both pics.

For the first 4 months however, I did not go Ultra Hard Mode. It took me 4 good months to build my Will Power up, polish my SR techniques and go Really Hard.

I started losing fat and would transmute through exercise for [four](https://imgur.com/cXT40VL) sometimes even [5 hours a day](https://imgur.com/QpPmG9X).  This doesn't include walks and passive exercises like hiking. These exercises were mostly balls to the wall [StairClimbing](https://imgur.com/qd89grw) in Zone 5 Heart Rate for the full hour or [Running](https://imgur.com/n9w9ysf) in Zone 5 Heart Rate again. My Heart Rate would stay at around 170 BPM for an hour or so because I would push myself [VERY VERY Hard](https://imgur.com/SN6jehd) which is apparently impossible according to my colleagues and an extremely knowledgeable Gym Trainer who has done a PhD (The Matrix).

They claimed that the HR Monitor on the machine is not accurate, I showed them the HR on my apple watch and they still wouldn't believe it.  
Anyways, it wasn't that I am some freak of nature or genetically gifted, it was all due to SR. Im sure some naysayers are going to show up in comments too.

When I lost weight, my Boss the manager aka Chad of my workplace: 6'2"" chiselled like a Greek God with wide shoulder and back who has 15% body fat took notice. He jokingly said, something along the lines of ""I do 100 floors of stairmaster in 20 minutes"". I had No other entertainment back then (Nowadays I have reddit). So I gave it a [try](https://imgur.com/SN6jehd). Sent him a pic and said it was easy as fuck.

He replied with [this](https://imgur.com/ltWEKzV). 100 floors in 17:06. Pretty fucking impressive I thought. But seriously 100 floors in 20 minutes was easy.

I tried a little bit in this [attempt](https://imgur.com/l53R4JE) where I managed 100floors under 16 minutes. It was relatively easy as well. I sent him this. [This](https://imgur.com/5147szo) was his reply. He also [secretly thought](https://imgur.com/XToAPTa) I was on steroids or something, so I sent him that needle when he replied. The change was that drastic. He asked me later too. I wouldn't blame him because he has been going to the gym for 10 years consistently, all of a sudden some fat kid started beating him for some inexplicable reason, I would think the same if I were him.

Anyways, I wondered if I went FULL balls to the wall(pun intended) what time I can do. [This ](https://imgur.com/pW9OBLV)is my personal record as of today. 100 floors in 14:43 min. You guys are welcome to try it and if you beat it let me know I will try to do better. I did reach my heart's potential during this approx 200 BPM as you can see in the machine and the AW screenshot.

There are some other instances where people [NOTICED](https://imgur.com/UapNS14) the timeline of my changes exactly and mentioned ""5 months ago"". This guy has been running for a decade he is half a decade older than me. Here's another [instan](https://imgur.com/P0VSS46)ce. He **knows** I will beat him. Spoiler alert: I did not but i was within 10 seconds of his time. I did not beat him because I did not push myself at the end he sprinted I did not.

Your relationships will dramatically improve with people around you on SR, they become attracted to you, they admire you. As you plow through challenges in the real world people start respecting you too, you get job offers, you get invited to social events etc.

# THE HANDBOOK

Lets get to the meat and bones. Take your notebook out and start writing this down if you are serious. That's what I did. Each move must be written down.

I started making a strategy to overcome this Fatal Net of Catastrophe.

Create a strategy to get rid of this trap, this net of habits. I am listing my own strategy down below: **Start with:**

Why do you want to do SR? Be 100% honest with yourself. Do you want to have a relationship? Do you want to have a one night stand? What exactly is your motivation? Sit down with your thoughts for a while. Figure out your why. Meditate.

Your ***WHY*** is very important. Specially in the long run. I will let you figure out your why. Don't feel bad if it's for the ladies.

Initially, all the Beginning retainers start for the ladies, eventually their WHY starts morphing into something more pure and moral. Sometimes your why needs an effort to morph into something wholesome sometimes it happens naturally. Depends on the person too.

""Why do SR?"" will be discussed a little later in this post. We will work on this creation of strategy a little more.

Just like a boxer watches videos of his opponents. He studies their jabs, their body language, their opening, their weaknesses and prepares a counter measure against it, a plan and practices that plan, owns it, then on the day of the match he anticipates the punches, the jabs, knows the patterns.

We will know our lower mind just as they know about their opponents :

Preparation and Anticipation are the weapons that will make your WILL POWER strong.  Your lower mind and the excuses it gives must be known. What are its preferences? What do you like to watch? Where do you commit the sin? At what time? What do you do after? What makes you want to release? What are the sources?

Then on the day of the match: You read its moves, dodge the jabs, catch its rhythm, know its patterns. Practice that plan, own it. That is how Retainers go 90 days, 120 days, years. They do not talk about it but thats how they do it. They know their own mind. Dodge the jabs at specific times of the night by sleeping early and you get the point. There are other posts that talk about it in more detail.



***""Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.""***

**\~1 Corinthians 6:18**



# DAY-0

So you committed the crime. You released. You are depleted. Or so you think: Well, I have good news and bad news for you.  
Good news is this: ONE RELEASE DOES NOT UNDO ALL OF YOUR PROGRESS.

Bad news is: IT STILL CAUSES HARM TO YOU AND YOUR PSYCHE.

One of my comments I made the other day :

*""Q1. Does a bodybuilder who stays up for the whole night. Drinks alcohol, eats processed food lose all his muscles in one night? NO*

*Does it harm his progress? Absolutely*

*Q2. If one has been losing fat for 30 days and eats a huge 4000 cal cheat meal on the 31st day, will he lose all his progress? NO*

*Did it set him back though? Absolutely*

*Q 3. If someone is trying to gain weight and has been eating in calorie surplus, fasts for one day, will he lose all his weight in one day? NO*

*Will it harm his progress? Absolutely*

*Human body is resilient and keeps one in the chamber ALWAYS.*

*Relapsing just once WILL ABSOLUTELY HARM your progress but it will not undo everything unless you consistently start relapsing for weeks.*

*Benefits will disappear for sometime but they will come back faster than when you were at rock bottom.""*

Makes sense?

**""TEMPTATION GROWS STRONGER WITH EVERY SURRENDER""**

# So what should you do?

You carry on EXACTLY AS YOU WERE. DON'T YOU DARE DO IT AGAIN.

Day-0 to Day-6 is arguably the hardest day to get through. Why? Because the images of the filth one consumes is really fresh in your memory. You have NO reason to hold back. Your mind makes you think you lost all your benefits.

Your mind playing games with you. It makes you think everything has reset back to square one. So you start relapsing really hard.

""It's Day-0 whats another relapse?......after a couple of hours.....whats another relapse?.........whats another relapse?""  
Bang you relapse until you are depleted. May be you don't relapse multiple times on Day-0, You relapse on Day-1, 2, 3 even sometimes Day-4 thinking you can redo it since it's easy anyway? The energy and sacrifice of Day-4 is not that big of a deal to your mind.

You see you are much less likely to release when you are at Day-20 or more compared to Day-0. WHY? ***BECAUSE OF YOUR INVESTMENT LEVEL.***

***What is investment level?***

***You are very less likely to sabotage something if you have invested high amounts of energy, time and effort into something. If you have worked for something really hard you are less likely to spend your hard-earned earnings.***

***Day-0 when you relapse only ONCE is a fallacy. But your mind makes you think you lost majority of your money might as well cash out the rest. Only when you start cashing out relentlessly and when there is $0 left in the bank. You realize the first loss was NOT that bad. You still had around 40-80% money left in the bank.***

***There is nothing that has taught me more about myself than Day-0 guys. Take out your notebooks because thats exactly what I did when I ended my long runs.***

***Preparation increases your investment level. The more you invest the more you become attached to your run. The harder the obstacles you overcome, the more your will power increases.***

***You prepare for and anticipate the memories of the sinful videos you like to watch. Eventually, you will have to face that urge. Eventually you will have to face your deepest most tempting desire at your weakest. Be prepared for that moment. Preparation is all you can do. The harder the battle the sweeter the spoils of war. There is nothing that compares to the Godly feeling when you finally say no that lingering past, that sexual thought that gnaws slowly in the back of your head. When you give it up, you become free and emerge as a new identity.***

# Again, so What should you do?

**There are many things going on here. The habit of releasing is not JUST ONE habit of releasing. There are OTHER habits tied to the habit of releasing that enables you to do it.**

**Habits exist in clusters (I call it a circle of habits). A single lone habit cannot exist in a human being. I**t's **always a few habits enabling  one another feeding into each other to make a loop and trap you in a downward spiral.** 

**THAT IS WHY SR is a CORE FOUNDATIONAL HABIT. A Retainer CANNOT CONSUME ALCOHOL, WEED, SUBSTANCES. A Retainer CANNOT EAT WHENEVER. A Retainer cannot sleep whenever. A Retainer cannot drink caffeine whenever. There HAS to be a fixed DIET. There HAS to be a fixed sleep schedule. A Retainer HAS to exercise. A Retainer has to create. Retention is the prerequisite to Godliness. Retention is the prerequisite to morality. The prerequisite to your Higher Self.**

**Retention CANNOT EXIST ALONE. THERE HAVE TO BE SUPPORTING HABITS TO SUSTAIN RETENTION HABIT. All these circle of habits start forming a new man.**

**Similarly, a releaser HAS to eat FAST FOOD/JUNK FOOD. A Releaser HAS to have a BAD SLEEPING SCHEDULE. A Releaser HAS to HAVE A BAD SOCIAL LIFE so he can Release alone in peace. A Releaser CANNOT exist with friends and relatives. A Releaser has to procrastinate so he can feel shame and guilt and then again find an escape from those feelings through dopamine. A Releaser HAS to have an addiction to short form social media because nothing else is more entertaining than sinful videos. A Releaser HAS to have an addiction to Games because nothing else tingles the dopamine receptors as much. Everything else is boring.**

It's **a vicious circle of dopamine release after dopamine release.**

**So to break the releasing habit on Day-0 You start by breaking the circle of habits. Target the other habits first.**

# #1 BUILD THE ""NO MUSCLE"":

**What happens immediately AFTER you release? You feel hungry. Don't you?**

**Hungry for the most caloric dense meal you can find: which is often Junk Food. Fast Food. You order something. Or go through your fridge.**

**Here's what you do: Since, You couldn't say No to releasing. You will say No to Refuelling. Break the circle. Relax for a couple of hours. Go to sleep if you feel sleepy.**

**You will feel like you are dying. Thats the mind's doing. Let the body sit in pain.**

**The more you reward the mind AFTER release with tasty JUNK FOOD the worse it gets, hence the repetitive release circle.**

**One needs the mind to associate the release with Pain. You start with saying no to the mind when it wants to refuel.**

**YOU BUILD THE ""NO MUSCLE"".**

**EACH TIME YOU SAY NO TO THE LOWER MIND AND DO SOMETHING DIFFICULT A PART OF YOUR BRAIN GROWS DENSER AND BIGGER!!**

**Physically BIGGER & More Dense!!** It's **called the Anterior MidCingulate Cortex, the seat of Will Power in your brain.**

[**Watch This 1 minute video.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ukg6NOenepg) **This video always gives me Goosebumps. Make a playlist of videos like this and watch it everyday.**

Don't refuel your body. You fast for the rest of the day. Punish your mind for releasing. You will feel like you are dying, shivering and all kinds of stuff. Excuses are the number 1 symptom of a releasing mind. You won't die if you don't eat for half a day bud. (I don't take responsibility if you really die(LOL), consult your doctor)

**""Think of Each NO to the pleasure Impulse as a REP against the weight of Temptation that builds the muscle of your WILL POWER.""**

# ""For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor..""

**\~1 Thessalonians 4:3-5**

# #2 THINGS TO DO LIST/DO YOUR CHORES:

**Your punishment is underway. Good You are not eating anything for the rest of the day. But you cannot sit around specially when the imagery associated with releasing is still sitting fresh in your mind. So you get to doing your daily chores.**

**START WITH A THINGS TO DO LIST EVERYDAY AND PUT IT IN YOUR HANDWRITING ON A STICKY NOTE NOT ON YOUR PHONE- ON YOUR BATHROOM MIRROR.**

**You put realistic tasks on that list which you were putting off and start doing WITHOUT THINKING. Doesn't matter which ones you do first. Start with the easiest ones.**

**The Psychology behind this is we need to build back the momentum. The winner effect. You start with the smallest things.**

**To Curb the psychological effect of releasing : Which is a huge loss mentally, you start stacking realistic small wins for the day.**

**Here, read** [**this study :**](https://www.uvws.org/news/s94a63z7yun3fczjm80xh8fzivafkb) **85 year old Longitudinal Study from Harvard States that Children who started doing chores from the age of 4-5 years were happier, more successful and were living a more fulfilling life.**

**Want to take a guess WHY? or if you can be happy too as an adult? YES YOU CAN. Here is** [**the actual study**](https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/337/bmj.a2338.full.pdf)**.**

**The reason for this is : Every psychological win increases Testosterone and Drive to do more. Doing chores is a psychological win.**

**There was a** [**study**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19804944/) **where elite hockey athletes were shown video tapes of their victories in the past.**



 **These were just videos, the victory actually did NOT even happen in the present but still Testosterone of the whole team increased by 42%-44%!!!.** 



**Just a mere thought of victory boosts your Testosterone levels. Such is the power of the mind.**

**It NEEDS to be** a psychological **win. Doing chores is exactly that. You are stacking victories and distracting yourself from the loss, the fresh imagery in your mind, you are not resorting to the deed again AND you are being productive, it is also a punishment - that will raise your mood, endorphins, testosterone as well.** It's **a win-win-win-win situation.**

**It also makes the perception of time faster and the days go by really quick so you can be back on track. So you won't be on Day-0 forever.**

**Turns out Mr Jordan Peterson was right all along - Get to cleaning your room and then clean your kitchen. Help your family members.**

**“When you choose Discipline, the pain of labor passes quickly, but the good endures a very long time; When you choose indulgence, the pleasure passes quickly, but the guilt endures a very long time.”** 

# #3 CREATE A MENTAL BOOKMARK

""**A MAN GAINS THE STRENGTH OF THE TEMPTATION HE RESISTS""**

**While doing your chores You WILL have shameful thoughts, full of guilt, regret and basic sadness going through you.**

**I need you to put it ALL on a paper. Write each and every detail. Be comprehensive. Be Exhaustive. Do your Chores. A thought comes in your mind. Write it down with a pen. With your hand. Don't type it. We need it to be as personal as possible. You do the chores but since you released you will need a break. Do this during the break. Don't touch the phone.**

**If you do it properly: You will cry here. You will feel the guilt amplify. Let it go through you. It is feedback of the sin you committed. Let that feedback sink in. Express your guilt on that paper. God is teaching you something through suffering.**

**Learn that lesson and create a mental bookmark on that piece of paper. Write a letter here to your future self. Write why he shouldn't do it again. How it made you feel after you did it. It should be at least 19-21 pages long. The longer it is the better. Write your dreams, write why you want to go on longer SR runs. Everything and anything that comes to your mind. Every small little detail. What kind of woman you are looking for. What qualities she must have. There is no shame in having standards and imagining your perfect life, visualizing it and then working toward it. What is your dream car? What color is it?**

**More investment = More Fear of Releasing. You want to have your dream life ready and planned.**

**This is for when the lust strikes again. This is your last resort. This is the trump card. Invest in your trump card. Strategy. This is the preparation. The better the prep the better the performance on match day. The day you feel like giving in- You pull this notebook out and start reading the letter. Go through it. Unconvince yourself. Drop the negotiation to edge.**



**""BEFORE YOU COMMIT LUST, REMEMBER THAT GOD IS WATCHING YOU. PLEASURE LASTS A MOMENT, ETERNITY IS FOREVER.""**



# #4 Read the posts on Retention by others who relapsed, success stories.

**Have no other source of dopamine. Create a playlist pertaining to retention. Listen to Goggins, Andrew Huberman, Jocko Willinks. This is your entertainment now. No short form social media. NO youtube. NO PUTTING YOUR STREAK AT RISK. MINIMIZE ALL RISK. MOVE WITH STRATEGY.**

**Download audio books. ""Cant Hurt me"" by David Goggins is free on Google Podcasts App. Its a 13 hour audio book. More than enough to get you through at least a week.**

Remember the circle of habit? Yea, all social media needs to go too. There are other posts that talk about this in more detail.

**""IN THIS ERA A LUSTFUL MAN CAN LOSE EVERYTHING IN A DAY""**





# #5 INTERMITTENT FASTING AND MINIMIZE ANIMAL PRODUCTS, CAFFEINE, TEA, NO VEGETABLE OILS (NO CARNIVORE DIET)

**This is a controversial one. Many people will not like this. Animal products raise your sexual desire tenfold.**

**The only liquid you consume is Water. Nothing else. No green tea (Tea Bags have microplastics), No coffee/Tea (inner lining of Take Away Coffee Cups have microplastics), No Making Coffee in your house - It disturbs your circadian Rhythm aka sleep patterns.** 

  


# #6 MENTAL CELIBACY

**This is probably the most important point of all.** 

**You must become the man who can say NO to the woman in the red dress. You must be BETTER THAN NEO and Not even look at the woman in the Red Dress.**

**The sad truth is: All release is a Conscious Decision. The lower mind fools us into consciously releasing. We are fools.**

**The process starts like this : The lower mind who is a master at making excuses and enters into a negotiation. It tries to Have the cake and eat it too.**

**It will make excuses: ""Watching once does not harm, its called ""Semen Retention"" if i watch it I don't release it"", ""I will not actually release it but do the act""**

**This is the devil, the lower mind whispering in your ear to have fun AND to continue the streak. Only the spell of the devil is too strong and you forget everything until the promise is broken.**

  
**So, we set the bar even higher than just release. We promise ourselves we will NOT even entertain a single sexual thought. It won't be allowed to even linger around in our mind. If we entertain the sexual thought, the SR Run is over"" The run is not about physical release anymore.** it's **about mental celibacy.**

**If we aim for the mountains we reach the hill BUT If we aim for the stars, we reach the mountains at least.**

**We nip all the thoughts in the bud. We do not give ANY sexual thought, fertile ground. We do not let it grow. We never enter into a negotiation with our lower mind. We never hit the snooze button.**

**No means no.** 

**YOU NIP IT IN THE BUD**



**We have been releasing because we enter into a negotiation with ourselves and try to find a middle ground. As we give away ground, we start losing the whole position. Part of it happens because of forgetfulness. Which is why we created that mental bookmark right when we relapsed.** 

**Gentlemen: The first thought is the easiest to say NO to.**

**The moment you say yes to even a peek, consider it a relapse because it is one. It is no more a matter of IF but a matter when the physical release will follow.**



# #7 YOUR WHY

**The most important section is the last. (#6 and #7 go hand in hand) Your why?**

**Your WHY is very important. If you don't know your why, the world will tell you your why: You do not want that.**

Let's **just say: You want a relationship with a girl thats your why.**

**Thats the end game of SR?**

***""What is my END GAME of retention? Will I retain indefinitely? Or until I get a girlfriend?""***

***This is the million dollar question in this sub. What to do with Retention. The conundrum.***

Let us entertain this line of thought for a minute:

You meet a pretty woman after retaining for a few months

Not only do you attract a 10/10 supermodel tier woman, You managed to convince her to become your girlfriend thanks to Retention.

The obvious thing you do NEXT is you have intercourse with her multiple times a day for 6 months straight.

You are happy in the relationship. BUT:

Now you are nothing like the Retainer you once were. Drained and depleted.

***If SR was the thing that attracted her in the first place as soon as you're empty she will have no reason to be with you.***

Let's assume she loves you and decides to stay. Even so, now you will be stuck and not able to create anything substantial which you could have when on SR. You have to take care of her physical needs. You can try not releasing while being with her but when does it stop? You ejaculate by mistake or she leaves. One of these things might happen. Our aim in life is to minimize the risks and live a fulfilling life. This is not fulfilling for you or for her.

Not only are you doing injustice with yourself but also with your gf. She deserves better. She knows it too.

She might leave soon if you stagnate which ***you*** ***will*** if your Goal was only to get a GF and nothing else.

Even if you somehow retain while being with your GF you will still need insane level of Will Power, Drive and Determination. Which will be neigh impossible.

Plus at the back of your mind - You will always think you got her because you were retaining. After you release you will have gnawing thought in the back of your mind that you're not good enough because you're not retaining. Lack of internal confidence might cause the relationship to dwindle.

You see where I am getting at?

Just Semen Retention is one of the BEST HABITS one can foster.

BUT it's the initiation point not the end game of our journey.

Semen Retention is one of the best Core Foundational Habits BUT IT ***CAN*** ***NEVER*** REMAIN THE ONLY ONE in your arsenal!

Back to circle of habits.

**Your goal of SR MUST BE to create a COMPLETE MAN. A Man who has an unshakeable circle of habits built through SR.**

**A cluster of habits so productive and creative that you've built a momentum of winning for LIFE.**

**You become a person who does the hard things in life. The Right Thing to Do is often the hard thing to do. You become that man.**

**You become a MAN who loves to create, build and learn new cluster of habits and skills each and everyday. Thats the goal. To never be a procrastinator ever again. A man who is fearless, LUST does not control him, FEAR does not control him, he has a good head over his shoulders, he is not quick to jump into relationships, A man who is happy whether he is alone or in a relationship. He is a self sufficient man. The Complete Man. He knows how to fight, protect, plans for the future. A Masculine Stoic Man who only Fears God and follows His Word. Once you become this man, you are free to release with women if you so desire. He has laid the foundation of habits the cluster of habits, the cluster of skills that enable him to build momentum, win for himself and for his family. He knows all the life skills has all emotions under control. He is rational, logical and does not give in to the lower basal animalistic vices.**



**Women often date assholes for this very reason. Weak men who fall head over heels for women are actually prisoners of their own lust. Only the looks of the woman were enough to make him powerless. LUST >> INTELLECT. Women know if looks are enough to win you over then you are low value. Enter Friend Zone. If a woman does NOT INVEST IN YOU with time, effort and mentally she is not afraid to lose you. And nice guys then go through heart break. Vicious Circle, Rinse and Repeat.**

**REMEMBER INVESTMENT = FEAR.**

**And Women know this sub-consciously. What if the woman is a serial killer, a compulsive liar, has STDs, has falsely accused her past partners. The Releaser is quick to jump into relationships. If releaser is controlled by his lust, what will happen if the woman or her child is in danger, if there is a robber threatening to kill her??. The releaser will LIKELY be controlled by his FEAR too and run away without protecting his family.**

**What if John Cena slaps your Momma? What will you do? Are you prepared? How can you overcome your fear if you cannot overcome your lust?**

**A man who is weak to lust WILL BE WEAK TO his FEAR, WEAK to all the other vices. Circle of Habits. No woman wants a viceful man. No man wants a viceful friend. Can you blame them?**

**Assholes not only stand up for themselves, they overlook women's beauty (however crass their methodology) and get her to qualify herself to them. Just beauty is not enough to move the asshole's strings.**

**Women find this safe. At least the asshole is not a slave to his Lust, that means he is more than likely not a slave to his FEAR either. He will fight not run away.**



**If you have a daughter : Would you want** a **complacent addicted man who games, smokes weed, watches porn, eats junk food, smells bad for her? Would you want her to marry a guy who gives in to his lust without stepping back thinking twice about the repercussions?**

**Now you see why Retainers look down on this line of thought?**

**LUST has too much power over this generation of men.** 

**A man who is quick to fall into temptation is not masculine.** 

**The nature of Masculine is to be Detached from Vices.** 

**The nature of Masculine is to be a rock, to be wise, think long term.** 

**The nature of Masculine is to Learn to Say No to himself first and then others around him.** 

**Inculcate Discipline not only in himself but also in his family, his children and his friends.** 

**The nature of Masculine is to be a Leader to himself first and then to his family.** 

**The nature of Masculine is to be A Man's Man.** 

**It is to sacrifice without complaining.** 

**The Nature of Masculine is to go through pain, hard work and cut down mountains to build cities.**

**The Nature of Masculine is to Keep Going Despite Failure, Pick yourself up, no matter how weary the spirit, to keep moving.**

But in yesterday's episode, I didnt like Chum at all as well. Just because these guys dont want to eat, or have had access to some sort of snack already, I saw they were eating a bowl of something in the morning and Shrutika got coffee as well. After all that now they say we wont eat and because of our decision no one else gets to cook food as well, i mean why? if someone who has no love lust with this group, and wants to eat, then who the fuck are they to stop her? and Chum was physical with Chahat, and the Lady mind coach also, and then when she screamed about it so then Shrutika says uff let her cook she is creating a ruckus yaar. 

Why isnt anyone seeing through this shit and beyond the pretty looks of Chum and Shrutika? 

Eisha and Alice are harmless honestly, they have nothing to give, these two are the real closeted mean girls  and if people arent seeing that cause they are blind to their cuteness and pretty looks, then I think its working for them. ",6,1729308705.0,biggboss,17,0.62,False

Monday:
**Perfume 1: The Archivist’s Key

	•	Detailed Breakdown: Imagine unlocking a heavy wooden door that hasn’t been opened in decades, leading into an archive filled with dusty tomes. The scent of old parchment mingles with the aged wood of the shelves and the cool, untouched air. This is a scent of wisdom long hidden, carrying a weight of forgotten knowledge, but there’s something else, something otherworldly… a key that opens not just the archives, but another world.
	•	Notes:
	•	Top: Cool stone, beeswax candle.
	•	Heart: Old parchment, ink-stained wood, and incense left behind by ancient scholars.
	•	Base: Soft resin, sandalwood, and the ghostly echo of amber.

Perfume 2: Shadows in the Stacks

	•	Detailed Breakdown: As you wander deeper into the library, the lights flicker, and shadows lengthen along the walls. The scent shifts from the comfortable warmth of wood and paper to something a little colder, more uncertain. You can almost hear faint whispers between the shelves. This is the essence of mystery that feels like it’s unraveling itself around you.
	•	Notes:
	•	Top: Mahogany wood and a faint breeze carrying incense smoke.
	•	Heart: Aged leather and dust-covered pages.
	•	Base: Cold amber and distant musk, like a forgotten presence lingering in the air.

Perfume 3: The Silent Scholar

	•	Detailed Breakdown: You’re seated in an ancient reading room, where the scent of history clings to every surface. The quiet is thick, only broken by the rustling of papers and the occasional sigh of wind through the high windows. There’s a quiet power here, a dignity that commands respect without ever having to raise its voice. It’s intellectual, grounded, but with layers of unseen depth.
	•	Notes:
	•	Top: Crisp leaves and a faint touch of candle smoke.
	•	Heart: Old books, polished wood, and a hint of pipe tobacco smoke (without the heavy scent of tobacco itself).
	•	Base: Soft musk and amber, evoking the grounded presence of scholarly minds.

Tuesday:
Perfume 1: Moon’s Embrace

	•	Detailed Breakdown: This is the scent of the moon wrapping itself around the earth in a comforting, protective embrace. It’s cool and soft, like the feel of dew-drenched grass under your bare feet as you look up at the night sky. There’s an inherent stillness here, but with an underlying power that feels ancient and unshakable.
	•	Notes:
	•	Top: Fresh night air and crushed wildflowers.
	•	Heart: Moonflower, chamomile, and silvered lavender.
	•	Base: Pale musk and a touch of soft sandalwood, evoking a grounding connection with the earth.

Perfume 2: Veil of the Crescent

	•	Detailed Breakdown: A veil of moonlight falls across the landscape, cool and weightless. This scent is about quiet contemplation, the soft illumination of the crescent moon casting long shadows across the ground. It feels like a balance between light and darkness, with an ethereal quality that makes you feel both grounded and dreamlike.
	•	Notes:
	•	Top: Cold air, pale blossoms.
	•	Heart: Soft musk and hints of water lily.
	•	Base: White amber and a faint whisper of incense from distant rituals.

Perfume 3: Astral Tide

	•	Detailed Breakdown: The moon pulls the tides in an endless, quiet dance, and this scent mirrors that subtle, irresistible power. Imagine standing at the edge of the ocean at night, where the water glows faintly with reflected moonlight, and the air is heavy with salt and mystery. This scent captures both the reflective calm of the moon and its tidal pull.
	•	Notes:
	•	Top: Saltwater and cool, night-blooming florals.
	•	Heart: Silver lavender and chamomile.
	•	Base: Soft resins and a faint, grounding touch of driftwood.

Wednesday:
Perfume 1: Worn Denim

	•	Detailed Breakdown: This scent feels like your favorite old denim jacket—soft, comfortable, a little worn around the edges, but full of memories. There’s a sense of rebellion here, but it’s a quiet, self-assured rebellion. The scent is intimate, as though you’re catching fleeting whiffs of worn leather, faded smoke, and the scent of rain-soaked streets after a long day.
	•	Notes:
	•	Top: Damp pavement and soft rain.
	•	Heart: Faded leather and worn denim.
	•	Base: A hint of woodsmoke and dried moss.

Perfume 2: Ink Stains

	•	Detailed Breakdown: This scent evokes the quiet hours spent in a small café, scribbling in a notebook, lost in thought. The smell of fresh ink mingles with the faint scent of coffee and old paper. It’s a nostalgic, introspective scent that feels creative and slightly gritty, like someone who’s lived through and learned from every word they’ve written.
	•	Notes:
	•	Top: Fresh ink and black coffee.
	•	Heart: Old paper and the faintest touch of sandalwood.
	•	Base: Soft amber and worn leather.

Perfume 3: Faded Graffiti

	•	Detailed Breakdown: Imagine walking through a forgotten part of the city, where the walls are covered in old graffiti, the colors now faded and peeling. There’s a sense of time passing, but also of personal expression left behind. The scent feels urban but soft, with a touch of rebellion that never fades.
	•	Notes:
	•	Top: Wet concrete and faded paint.
	•	Heart: Violet leaf and the distant scent of the city.
	•	Base: Cool musk and a hint of asphalt after rain.

Thursday: Futuristic Nomad
Perfume 1: Synthetic Horizons

	•	Detailed Breakdown: Imagine a landscape where the natural and the synthetic blur together—endless horizons of metallic sand and strange, glowing plants. This is a futuristic scent that feels slightly surreal, like you’re traveling through a world not yet known, but also familiar.
	•	Notes:
	•	Top: Brushed steel and dry air.
	•	Heart: Faintly glowing flowers and dust.
	•	Base: Warm amber and a touch of metallic spice.

Perfume 2: Nomad’s Mirage

	•	Detailed Breakdown: You’re walking through a desert of shifting sands, with strange visions appearing and disappearing in the distance. The air is dry and hot, but there’s a sense of mystery and discovery. This is a scent about finding beauty and wonder in the barren, unfamiliar landscapes of the future.
	•	Notes:
	•	Top: Dry desert air and a touch of incense smoke.
	•	Heart: Spiced leather and sand.
	•	Base: Earthy resins and a faint touch of metal.

Perfume 3: Techno-Organic

	•	Detailed Breakdown: This scent bridges the gap between nature and technology. It evokes a world where plants and machines are intertwined, growing together in ways that are both natural and engineered. It’s a futuristic scent with an earthy core.
	•	Notes:
	•	Top: Metallic notes and green herbs.
	•	Heart: Fresh air and synthetic florals.
	•	Base: Cedarwood and resin.

Friday: Muted Fairycore
Perfume 1: Enchanted Glade

	•	Detailed Breakdown: A soft, hidden clearing in the forest, where the sunlight barely touches the ground and the air is cool with dew. The scent is green and gentle, with a sense of being in a place untouched by time. It’s the scent of quiet, personal magic.
	•	Notes:
	•	Top: Dew-covered leaves and wet moss.
	•	Heart: Soft ivy and fern.
	•	Base: Earth and the faint scent of wildflowers.

Perfume 2: Twilight Grove

	•	Detailed Breakdown: As the sun sets, a hidden grove begins to glow with soft, natural light. The trees whisper in the wind, and the scent of flowers and earth fills the air. It’s a gentle, peaceful magic that feels both protective and calming.
	•	Notes:
	•	Top: Twilight air and soft florals.
	•	Heart: Ivy, oakmoss, and the scent of distant rain.
	•	Base: Wet earth and pale musk.

Perfume 3: Forest Dreams

	•	Detailed Breakdown: You’re in a dreamlike forest, where everything feels soft and hazy. The air is thick with magic, but it’s the kind of magic that’s gentle and healing, like a protective lullaby. The scent is calming, green, and quietly magical.
	•	Notes:
	•	Top: Green leaves and soft rain.
	•	Heart: Moss and fern.
	•	Base: Soft musk and the faintest hint of wild herbs.

I am currently a transfer junior in college majoring in Journalism. I know right now my industry isn't doing so well in the job market and well I am taking a nutrition class and really enjoying it. I want to get my Masters in Nutrition from SJSU and I am planning on doing my prerequisites. 

Currently, I have no idea what to do in terms of gaining experience for my Masters program. I work as a barista at a coffee shop for the past two years and have my ServSafe certification. Besides learning the nutritional stuff on our foods, learning food management, good customer service and cleaning, I am unsure how I can learn more. I was planning on applying for some nutritional aide jobs in a rehabilitation/hospital setting and looking into Meals on Wheels to volunteer. 

I was wondering if anyone would advice on how I gain better experience and understanding about nutrition? Also please tell me what good things you enjoy doing working in nutrition, I am trying to find out more positive things about it.

our closers are the best and almost always have us set up with a near perfect close even with rough nights. they leave things like whip, sweet cream, and mocha to us most nights (which is fine, they get their asses kicked at night so the fact we rarely even need to make sauce backups is a godsend). we don’t even need to grab ice or milk most of the time


here lately my manager has been scheduling different people to open & they won’t do ANYTHING. i came in at 6:45 this morning and there was absolutely zero prep. 3 whips, 2 pitchers of sweet cream, only 1 of each sauce backups ups, no inclusions, didn’t replenish the ice or milk that they used up, cups and lids were running low. there was barely any business this morning from what sales looked like. peak starts at 7-7:30 and there were 5 people who opened for whatever reason, so they had TWO. HOURS. to get shit done. last night was really bad (they hit numbers higher than peak & only had a 2 man play from 12p-close)

the close isn’t even what i’m mad about, because the closers were undeniably in a bad spot & they saw we had 4 strong baristas + my SM opening so they made sure the store was clean and fridges + ice bins were stocked at minimum. the fact that 4 people stood around for 2 hours and complained about the close and refused to do anything because “it’s the closer’s job” is what i’m pissed about. i would get it if bad closes were a regular thing, but they aren’t.

idk, maybe i’m taking the job too seriously anymore but it feels like not a single person at my store gives a fuck anymore and are way too comfortable dumping the load onto everyone else bc they have issues with our manager and can’t communicate like grown ass adults ",4,1729308085.0,starbucksbaristas,2,1.0,False

Gotten pre-ground coffee from kimbo thinking that it will be suitable for french press but alas, although not terrible it's not suitable as well since the it's too fine and cleaning the plunger mesh is troublesome. Currently 25% through the kimbo brick and will look to get a hand-wound manual grinder and freshly roasted beans.

**Current regime** (roast me if you want but do give me tips to improve!) for 1 cup (\~320ml)

1. pre-heat the flask for a short while while i prep the other tools
2. pour 1.5 tablespoons of ground coffee into flask after pouring out pre-heat water, put in almost-boiling water into flask just enough to cover coffee to bloom for 30 seconds
3. Immediately pour remaining water into flask, brew for 3 minutes
4. Plunge, pour, drink. No sugar.

**Washing**: still struggling to find out most convenient way, initially put water into flask and plunge with some force repeatedly to flush out the fine-ground coffee out of the mesh, but it seems to be getting stuck more and more. Now i just run the mesh under tapwater and it's easier to clean, no stuck particles.

1g6zvk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ChocoBurritoCake/comments/1g6zvk4/anchor/,Anchor,"So eto na nga yung chika...

I sat down with a friend sa Cinnabon sa SM Southmall kasi we both needed coffee. Edi dito nagusap kami ng tungkol sa madaming bagay lalo na kung pano ako naapektohan mentally nung umuwi dito yung mga tita ko at yung parents ko. Napagusapan namin don na dapat hindi ako makonsensya na hindi ako sumama sa parents ko when they were here kasi totoo naman na hindi ko kayang makasama sa kanila kasi di ko sila kayang kasama. Na dapat hindi ako mapressure sa mga sinasabi ng mga tita ko kasi I have my own path to take, I have my priorities, I have my life to figure out na dapat hindi ako sumusunod sa pattern nila.

Then eto na, ang pinaka juicy part. Yung masyado akong fixated na ""mag-isa lang ako at walang kasama. gusto ko ng kasama."" although it's basic human need, na magkaron ng kasama, pero dapat hindi ako masyadong magfixate don kasi may mga tao pa namang nakapaligid sakin. I have my friends and family tapos yung 'kasama' na hinahanap at hinihintay ko eh dadating din when the time is right. so before mangyari yon, I should try and better myself first. I mean, alam ko naman yon, pero sobrang ramdam ko kasing magiisa lang ako habang buhay. haha! I mean, yes, as of today may roommate naman ako na nakakasama ko sa gabi at pag off nya, tapos pag umaga naman, may mga nakakasama naman akong friends, magastos, pero ganon talaga. haha! gusto ko ng kasama eh. Pero I think, the reason why I am hyperfixating on the fact na magisa lang ako kase, my birthday is coming up and I am scared to face the fact na 35 na ako pero wala paring akong partner. wala akong go to person. I have no one to share my life with. wala ako nung taong mapupuntahan pag masaya ako or nagkaron ako ng achievements. wala ako nung taong matatakbuhan pag gusto kong umiyak or may nangyaring masama. no one chooses me. kaya I feel like I have no one kahit may mga kaibigan at pamilya naman ako.

Lastly, lagi naman to pumapasok sa usapan kasi alam nya yung past namin ni Tammy, so kinumusta nya ako, kami kung hindi daw ba sya toxic sakin, kung ano na yung status ng friendship namin, kung mabuti ba yung effect nya sa buhay ko lately o kung nagbabago ba sya. stuff like that. edi I opened up to her about our current status na we're roommates and we're been together almost everyday for months now. Tapos that's when she asked me kung okay lang ba ako, kung okay parin ako. Nagsabi naman ako ng totoo. Sabi ko, okay lang ako pero may mga fears ako at may mga nararamdaman ako na ayokong aminin sa sarili ko pero ginagawan ko ng temporary solutions. La akong magagawa don, di ko yon controlled eh. Ano na yung fears at yung nararamdaman kong hindi ko maamin sa sarili ko? Eto.  
Natatakot akong maging dependent sa kanya, kasi nga sya yung anchor ko. He's the one keeping me steady na natatakot ako na pag umalis na sya - since, whether I like it or not, mawawala at mawawala din naman talaga yung ganitong closeness namin sooner or later since temporary lang naman talaga yung samin, magspiral ako kasi I am depending on him. Sabi ko sa kasama ko kanina, alam ko yon kaya nga I've been doing stuff, little by little na magiging fall back ko pag nangyari na yon. Ayokong aminin sa sarili ko na sya yung parang nacoconsider ko na best friend ko, yung go to person ko. I've been denying that since we made up kasi nagawa ko na yon dati at di lang naging maganda yung ending nung story na yon. yes, it was in the past pero syempre andon yung fear na baka mangyari ulit. Pero I honestly appreciate him trying to be there for me whenever he can. I can see him growing little by little - not everything can be done overnight. I see him try. I see him being there for me when I need him, its not all the time pero I see him try. I see that he's maturing and learning and improving little by little, and I am honestly proud of him. He still has a lot to improve and learn, he needs a lot of growing up pero I am proud of him. I celebrate his achievements, whether big or small. Anyway, although he's been doing a great job growing up pero it still scares me na baka hindi nya ako mahandle as a person or baka maging dependent nga kasi ako sa kanya.  
Pero one thing my friend asked me not to do is to shoo him away or push him away. Kasi I subtly do it whenever I say na he'll leave eventually. Tinanong nya din ako na what if same kami ng tingin sa isa't isa, na hindi lang pala sya vocal kaya di ko alam and he also doesnt know how to show it kasi nga he's still learning. Napashrug nalang ako. Haha Anyway, ang point ko dito, I should always watch my actions and everything else kasi nga baka magspiral ako pag nawala na yung anchor ko.",1,1729307586.0,u_ChocoBurritoCake,0,1.0,False

Hi Reddit, I want to apologize in advance as this is likely to be a long and confusing post.
I ‘32M’ have recently reconnected with an old friend ‘39M’ . Let's call him Jason. We originally met almost 10 years ago when I had initially started dating my ex. ‘40M’ He can be Kyle for the sake of this post. (Skip to *** for present day situation without backstory)

 Jason was a client of my Ex's work and they'd become friends outside of his job due to their common interests and worldviews. Jason and I became friends shortly after - also having things in common and at the time living similar lifestyles.

Jason was a fixture during Kyle and I's 4 years together. Unfortunately my relationship with Kyle was not a healthy one and there was a lot of on and off with us. Jason was kind of in an awkward position but at a few points encouraged both of us to split up. When Kyle and I called it quits for the final time I still hung out with Jason pretty regularly.

After a few months of moping and feeling sorry for myself I decided to move and start a new life. So l did just that. Kyle kept light contact here and there but I quickly limited that seeing how fast he had moved on. Jason and I spoke here and there but not often as I knew he likely still hung out with Kyle a fair bit. 6 months after my move I traveled home to gather the last of my things. I did see my Ex and he put on a show for me, but I went back to my new home after I got what I needed.

Not long after arriving back to my new life I'm celebrating my birthday. Jason reaches out to wish me a happy birthday. We talk and he spills everything on Kyle. What he was up to during and after our relationship. It was the first crack in seeing my old relationship was entirely constructed. It caused me to cut all contact with Kyle, and Jason just sort of fell by the wayside in my new life.

9 months go by and I hear from Kyle. I got a sob story and a very ambiguous apology. But I had a trauma bond and it was enough to pull me back in.
For those confused we're now 5.5 years into my 4 year relationship. (This will make more sense as you read.) I then repeated this cycle on and off with my ex for the next 3 years which meant I had cut Jason out not wanting a middle man.
Jason messaged me a couple times through the years but l ignored it. By year 8 of knowing my ex l had moved back home, and my ex had since moved to another city due to some self inflicted drama. I still had a sliver of hope for Kyle but after 8 years I had done some reflecting and realized that my ex actually fit more than enough of the diagnostic criteria of a person with NPD.

Kyle did reach out, and I knowing what I knew had an ultimatum. Couples therapy if he wanted to be in any form of contact whatsoever, and if we made it far enough into therapy I made clear I wanted us both to be psychologically analyzed so what happened between us could be explained. As you can guess, it did not work out. (And for the record it's now been two years since that - I have heard from him but I don't have anything to say. I'm done, did my soul searching, and I don't want that in my life.) I did find out while in contact that he had cut Jason off after he told me about my ex running around.

***
That brings us to present day. Jason reached out a couple of months back. This time I didn't ignore him, knowing that he wasn't connected to my ex, lived in my city, and we had a preexisting friendship to build off of. We caught up about the crap we'd both been through in our personal lives and re bonded over both being in better places. He's recently broken up with his longtime GF (it doesn't sound like it was healthy) so he's getting back out into life too.
We met up the first time a month ago. Went for coffee, had a long walk and caught up. I asked about his ex prior to his recent one as I knew her and he said they haven't spoken in a long time. This is where things start getting weird. Jason has been known to say some??? things but this was the first to really catch me off guard. He told me she got mad with him because he ""wouldn't be bi"". Which I thought was weird to share. Maybe he was trying to be relatable? I don't know. But it goes on. I shared my vape with him and after we made it back to his truck and we drove closer to my house we parked and chatted.

He must have told me at least five times that nicotine makes him horny. He got into how he has been so horny in general lately and now that it's over with his ex he thinks it's time to experiment. He shared a recent conquest and pried into whether or not l'd had any entanglements since being back in the city. I was a little coy but l've not been up to much anyway. The conversation just struck me as a conversation l'd have with a guy from tinder. Not one of my long time friends, and a straight one at that. My girl friends barely get the deets on my intimate life, my guy friends and I don't discuss it.

He had to head to work so he asked if I'd be comfortable with a hug, I said sure, leaned over and got a pretty tight squeeze.
I talked it out with my bestie, and she is living because she thinks it's obvious, but in my mind that interaction wasn't enough to convince me.
Especially with the Bi thing coming up earlier on.
However, I think for context I need to share that I'm a little naive to the advances of others. I can't tell when I'm being hit on until after l've walked away from the conversation, and more than once have I wound up going back to someone's place *honest to god* not realizing I was being invited for sexy time.

We've continued to talk and being horny has come up from him more than once. There was a message about ""wanting to hang out but it being late, and being stuck at work feeling tired and horny."" Which are not words I would put into a message to any of my friends. Straight or gay, male or female. I'd only tell that to someone I'm pursuing. So at this point I'm starting to feel very confused.

Last weekend we hung out. And it did my head in. Obviously there was a lot of nicotine makes me horny chat from him, and at one point he said he needed to lay off it for a bit because of that. He put his head back on the couch and his arms up over top. I noticed him glancing through the corner of his eye. There were actually multiple points throughout the night I caught him looking over at me from the corner of my view. I ordered food and he made a joke about buying him dinner beforehand. A lot of comments about how great the lighting in my room was for setting the mood (and that's been brought up in online conversation at least 4 times).

The body language was saying something. There were multiple points where he had shifted his body half towards me, half towards the front of the couch, and he did that thing where you have the arm closer to the other person up - we all know that thing. I swear he was about to lean in. And I got that from him a couple times throughout the night. There was actually a point where my heart was POUNDING - but I wasn't nervous. This wasn't a date. This is my friend. So I almost feel like I was picking that up from him. We talked a bit about dating life. I brought up being hairless probably doesn't help my dating life (I'm not a butch guy) and he said he thinks it's better. (Why would that be relevant to someone outside of my pool?)

When we were picking episodes from our binge fest he would ask to watch an episode after me just discussing how awkwardly sexual it was - and he brought up episodes featuring gay themes a couple of times. At a couple points in the night he also expressed a lot of curiosity surrounding a small bottle of cleaner many gay men have in their nightstand IYKYK knowing I had it, and at one point considered trying it. (This is for performance). The kicker was closer to the end of the night when he mentioned he'd way rather sleep with me than my ex. Thank you, gold star compliment, take notes.

But WOAH. So I took the maybe-maybe not bate and told him a story about a rando straight guy I met at a bar and how we went back to his house for beer (in my mind). He seemed to like that story. He stayed until 1 and we parted ways without anything happening, but holy tension. And that visit was sandwiched in between two super tight, super close, leg between leg hugs.
We've been talking regularly. He's actually a better boyfriend than a real one. I got a hope you had a good sleep and have a great day text this week. But the conversation still seems off for a conversation with a guy friend. More horny talk. Letting me know all he had to wear under his uniform was underwear, and I even explained jockstraps to him. (To which he expressed concern about access to everything)
There's been other stuff throughout our reconnecting like him pointing out a suggestive photo of a thigh tattoo missing from my instagram page (I archived this over 4 months ago y'all).

There's also been an insistence that I WILL get to find out if my room really does set the mood. As well as just a glaring preoccupation of whether or not I've gotten it in at any point. It's just been weird.

So what's my move? I'm REALLY confused. The boy who can't pick up on vibes feels like he's reeeeally getting the vibes. But the source is questionable. I like this guy, as a friend, and I respect my friendships. l'd never cross a boundary and quite frankly good friends are far more valuable to me than a lay. That being said, I'm not not down? I'm normally a little reserved, but he *is* someone I know and trust, and he's not a bad looking guy either. He would probably have to make 100% of the first move though. Not 80, not 90, 100. I'm fully aware I'm not living in a world where I'm the default, so l can't push it.

But knowing that he was Kyle's friend first, thinks Kyle is gross, and Kyle being who is would've jumped at the chance to fool around with Jason considering he has a history of sleeping with his close friends kind of makes me want to do it for the plot. I don't have anything serious going on right now, nor am I looking for anything from anyone. And I love nothing more than irony. Sleeping with or fooling around with Jason would be a pretty good confidence booster, it'd be fun, it'd be fulfilling because l'd feel safe and like I trust the person I'm naked with. And it would also give Kyle a secret universal middle finger, because Kyle sucks. :)

TLDR;

Reconnected with an old friend. He’s told me a few times he’s horny. Most if not all of his jokes have been sexual/gay. When he was over at my house he was giving me the vibes he was going to make a physical move. His hugs have been closer than other friends, he’s complimented my physicality, been on me for attention, asked a lot of sexual questions, and shown more curiosity than I think a guy friend should. Of course from this alone the answer sounds obvious but I can’t fit that much context into a paragraph. ",1,1729307520.0,NoStupidQuestions,4,0.67,False

Went and [found it](https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando.html), it's 2 different statements in chapter 1 my memory jammed together apparently:

>Manfred bites his tongue to stifle his first response, then refills his coffee cup and takes another mouthful. His heart does a flip-flop: She's challenging him again, always trying to own him. ""I work for the betterment of everybody, not just some narrowly defined national interest, Pam. It's the agalmic future. You're still locked into a pre-singularity economic model that thinks in terms of scarcity. Resource allocation isn't a problem anymore – it's going to be over within a decade. The cosmos is flat in all directions, and we can borrow as much bandwidth as we need from the first universal bank of entropy! They even found signs of smart matter – MACHOs, big brown dwarfs in the galactic halo, leaking radiation in the long infrared – suspiciously high entropy leakage. The latest figures say something like seventy percent of the baryonic mass of the M31 galaxy was in computronium, two-point-nine million years ago, when the photons we're seeing now set out. The intelligence gap between us and the aliens is a probably about a trillion times bigger than the gap between us and a nematode worm. Do you have any idea what that *means*?""

And a few paragraphs later:

>He slips his glasses on, takes the universe off hold, and tells it to take him for a long walk while he catches up on the latest on the tensor-mode gravitational waves in the cosmic background radiation (which, it is theorized, may be waste heat generated by irreversible computational processes back during the inflationary epoch; the present-day universe being merely the data left behind by a really huge calculation). And then there's the weirdness beyond M31: According to the more conservative cosmologists, an alien superpower – maybe a collective of Kardashev Type Three galaxy-spanning civilizations – is running a timing channel attack on the computational ultrastructure of space-time itself, trying to break through to whatever's underneath.

And explored just a little further in Chapter 8:

>He points at the ceiling, which dissolves into a chaotic 3-D spiderweb that Rita recognizes, after some hours of subjective head-down archive time, as a map of the dark matter distribution throughout a radius of a billion light-years, galaxies glued like fluff to the nodes where strands of drying silk meet. ""We've known for most of a century that there's something flaky going on out there, out past the Böotes void – there are a couple of galactic superclusters, around which there's something flaky about the cosmic background anisotropy. Most computational processes generate entropy as a by-product, and it looks like something is dumping waste heat into the area from all the galaxies in the region, very evenly spread in a way that mirrors the metal distribution in those galaxies, except at the very cores. And according to the lobsters, who have been indulging in some *very* long baseline interferometry, most of the stars in the nearest cluster are redder than expected and metal-depleted. As if someone's been mining them.""

>""Ah."" Sirhan stares at his grandfather. ""Why should they be any different from the local nodes?""

>""Look around you. Do you see any indications of large-scale cosmic engineering within a million light-years of here?"" Manfred shrugs. ""Locally, nothing has quite reached ... well. We can guess at the life cycle of a post spike civilization now, can't we? We've felt the elephant. We've seen the wreckage of collapsed Matrioshka minds. We know how unattractive exploration is to postsingularity intelligences, we've seen the bandwidth gap that keeps them at home."" He points at the ceiling. ""But over *there* something different happened. They're making changes on the scale of an entire galactic supercluster, and they appear to be coordinated. They *did* get out and go places, and their descendants may still be out there. It looks like they're doing something purposeful and coordinated, something vast – a timing channel attack on the virtual machine that's running the universe, perhaps, or an embedded simulation of an entirely different universe. Up or down, is it turtles all the way, or is there something out there that's more real than we are? And don't you think it's worth trying to find out?""",7,1729307271.0,printSF,0,1.0,False

I raised with him that I find it a bit uncomfortable. There’s a difference between going for coffee, hanging out in a public place and being alone together at her house. Although he’s texting her and hanging out he said they’re just friends and he “doesn’t even know if he wants to be her friend that much because she’s a bit annoying and immature”.

Poor Ross!!!,"**Scene: Central Perk - A busy Saturday afternoon. The signature orange couch is occupied by Chandler, Ross, and Joey. The coffee shop is lively, with the comforting aroma of coffee filling the room.

**(A group of four women enters. They giggle as they spot Chandler and whisper among themselves.)**

**Woman 1:** (nudging her friends) Look at that guy! He’s so cute!

**Woman 2:** (grinning) And is that a hint of sarcasm I detect? I love a guy with a sense of humor!

**(They approach the couch, and Chandler notices them, leaning in with a confident smile.)**

**Woman 3:** (leaning in playfully) Hi there! We couldn’t help but notice your… um, stunning sense of style.

**Chandler:** (playing it up) Thank you! I strive for “I just woke up and threw on whatever was at the top of the pile” chic.

**Woman 4:** (laughing) Well, it’s working!

**(Woman 1 glances at her friends and then back at Chandler.)**

**Woman 1:** Would you like to join us at our table? We have a delightful dessert we’d love to share!

**(Chandler's eyes widen in surprise, and he glances at Ross and Joey.)**

**Chandler:** (grinning) A dessert invitation? My day just got infinitely better! 

**Ross:** (crossing his arms, annoyance creeping in) Seriously? 

**Joey:** (beaming) Go for it, man! This is your time to shine!

**(Chandler stands up, taking a moment to smooth his hair and adjust his shirt.)**

**Chandler:** (to the women) Lead the way ladies!

**(The group of women giggles as they head to their table, with Woman 1 playfully tugging on Chandler’s arm.)**

**(Once seated, Woman 1 immediately sits on Chandler’s lap, making him momentarily wide-eyed.)**

**Chandler:** ( looking at Ross and Joey) Uh, welcome to my… personal space?

**Woman 2:** (playfully brushing Chandler’s hair back) So, what do you do when you're not being charming?

**Chandler:** (trying to keep his cool) Well, I work in advertising, so basically, I’m a professional persuader. You know, like a magician but with more spreadsheets.

**(The women laugh, clearly entranced. Woman 3 pulls out a small dessert from a takeaway bag and offers it to Chandler.)**

**Woman 3:** Here, let me feed you!

**(She spoons a bite into his mouth, and he looks surprised.)**

**Chandler:** (chewing) Wow! This is delicious! It’s like my taste buds just threw a party and forgot to invite my sense of self-control!

**(The other two women giggle, and Woman 1 leans closer.)**

**Woman 1:** You’re the funniest guy we’ve met all day! How do you do it?

**Joey:** (to Ross, leaning back with satisfaction) See? My advice on confidence is working like a charm!

**Ross:** (fuming) Confidence? He’s practically a human dessert buffet! What am I supposed to do, sit here and take notes? 

**(Joey bursts into laughter at Ross’s outburst, drawing more attention to him.)**

**Joey:** (still laughing) Ross, man, you’ve got the charm of a Triceratops in a tuxedo.

**(The women giggle again, clearly entertained by the banter.)**

**Chandler:** (thinking quickly) Well, if you like dinosaurs, I can assure you my advice on dating is quite “prehistoric.” 

**(A chorus of laughter ensues, and Woman 1 shifts slightly closer, still perched on Chandler’s lap.)**

**Woman 1:** What’s your secret?

**Chandler:** (winking) Well, if you must know, it’s 90% jokes and 10% luck. And maybe a dash of conditioner. 

**(Chandler grins as the women seem utterly captivated by him. Ross glares in mock defeat, while Joey beams with pride.)**

**Joey:** (patting Ross’s back) Don’t worry, buddy. Your time will come. Just remember my tips!

**Ross:** (sighing) Right. Because nothing says romance like a PowerPoint presentation on fossils.

**(As Chandler continues to charm the women, the camera pans out, showing Ross sulking while Joey looks increasingly pleased with his matchmaking efforts.)**

This year I had the great opportunity to travel to United States for the first time Because, I was really excited since I always wanted to go there at least once, I stayed with a friend and her family and usually we will go around town have a nice meal in a nice restaurant and maybe grab some coffee in a close by coffee shop. 

Sometime that I have to add is that I'm white, despite having several family members that are more tann skinned, I'm white as a sheet, or at least that's what my family tells me, they said that during the change of seasons I go from white, to whiter, and I have been told by the people here in the states that I have a nice accent that's not very noticeable. 

Well, to the point of the story, yesterday afternoon I was having coffee with my friend, and since I was tired from having to speak on English the whole day, we were talking on Spanish, everything  was nice until a lady, that looked to be in her forties, approach us and started to scold me for talking on Spanish, she apparently heard me talking on English before and accuse me of  culture appropriate someone's else culture by talking on Spanish with my friend, saying that as a white girl I should be a shame of myself by pretending to be something I'm not. 

I was stunned because I have never had something like that happen to me before and I'm a very introvert person, and since I didn't want to make a scene, I just thanked the lady, the woman looked confused until I explained that I was from south America and that Spanish was in fact my native language, but I most have a really good pronunciation if she thought I was from the states, the woman looked flustered and said something I didn't quite understand and left quickly, my friend just laughed and we left soon after. 

After that I told a friend what happened and she told me that I had probably embarrassed the woman and I should have explained her more privately everything, and that I made her look bad in front of everyone in the coffee shop. 

Like I said I had never been in a situation like that before and I didn't know how to react, so am I the asshole for not explaining more carefully everything to that lady and let her apologize to me?",1,1729307170.0,AITAH,7,0.57,False

I am currently in my sophomore year of undergrad. I am looking to write my LSAT in august / september 2025.

I have asked upper year students / friends / coffee chats where to begin and I am getting a mixed bag of resources and conflicting opinions. I recognize that they removed logic games in the summer, which has impacted the offered resources.

Is there is anybody that could give me an outline as to the literal first steps and some resources to get started? So far I am looking into 7Sage, powerscore LR & RC bibles. Other than that I am not quite sure where to look. If you know of any further resources, podcasts or courses that helped you please let me know. I am very fortunate in the fact that pricing is not a barrier to entry.

Thanks!

I’m also really into Japanese animation (a good ol'anime classic binge is always a plus), and I love live music and art in all forms.

I struggle with the language sometimes, but I’m eager to meet new people, especially anyone in the LGBTQ+ community or others who share similar interests. Living in another country can feel a bit lonely sometimes, and I’d love to connect with like-minded people around here to hang out, play some games, or just explore the local culture together. 😊

My straight friend is giving me weird vibes. I’m I overthinking his moves or is something going on?

Involving Me 32M and my friend of 10 years 39M

Hi Reddit, I want to apologize in advance as this is likely to be a long and confusing post.
I ‘32M’ have recently reconnected with an old friend ‘39M’ . Let's call him Jason. We originally met almost 10 years ago when I had initially started dating my ex. ‘40M’ He can be Kyle for the sake of this post. (Skip to *** for present day situation without backstory)

 Jason was a client of my Ex's work and they'd become friends outside of his job due to their common interests and worldviews. Jason and I became friends shortly after - also having things in common and at the time living similar lifestyles.

Jason was a fixture during Kyle and I's 4 years together. Unfortunately my relationship with Kyle was not a healthy one and there was a lot of on and off with us. Jason was kind of in an awkward position but at a few points encouraged both of us to split up. When Kyle and I called it quits for the final time I still hung out with Jason pretty regularly.

After a few months of moping and feeling sorry for myself I decided to move and start a new life. So l did just that. Kyle kept light contact here and there but I quickly limited that seeing how fast he had moved on. Jason and I spoke here and there but not often as I knew he likely still hung out with Kyle a fair bit. 6 months after my move I traveled home to gather the last of my things. I did see my Ex and he put on a show for me, but I went back to my new home after I got what I needed.

Not long after arriving back to my new life I'm celebrating my birthday. Jason reaches out to wish me a happy birthday. We talk and he spills everything on Kyle. What he was up to during and after our relationship. It was the first crack in seeing my old relationship was entirely constructed. It caused me to cut all contact with Kyle, and Jason just sort of fell by the wayside in my new life.

9 months go by and I hear from Kyle. I got a sob story and a very ambiguous apology. But I had a trauma bond and it was enough to pull me back in.
For those confused we're now 5.5 years into my 4 year relationship. (This will make more sense as you read.) I then repeated this cycle on and off with my ex for the next 3 years which meant I had cut Jason out not wanting a middle man.
Jason messaged me a couple times through the years but l ignored it. By year 8 of knowing my ex l had moved back home, and my ex had since moved to another city due to some self inflicted drama. I still had a sliver of hope for Kyle but after 8 years I had done some reflecting and realized that my ex actually fit more than enough of the diagnostic criteria of a person with NPD.

Kyle did reach out, and I knowing what I knew had an ultimatum. Couples therapy if he wanted to be in any form of contact whatsoever, and if we made it far enough into therapy I made clear I wanted us both to be psychologically analyzed so what happened between us could be explained. As you can guess, it did not work out. (And for the record it's now been two years since that - I have heard from him but I don't have anything to say. I'm done, did my soul searching, and I don't want that in my life.) I did find out while in contact that he had cut Jason off after he told me about my ex running around.

***
That brings us to present day. Jason reached out a couple of months back. This time I didn't ignore him, knowing that he wasn't connected to my ex, lived in my city, and we had a preexisting friendship to build off of. We caught up about the crap we'd both been through in our personal lives and re bonded over both being in better places. He's recently broken up with his longtime GF (it doesn't sound like it was healthy) so he's getting back out into life too.
We met up the first time a month ago. Went for coffee, had a long walk and caught up. I asked about his ex prior to his recent one as I knew her and he said they haven't spoken in a long time. This is where things start getting weird. Jason has been known to say some??? things but this was the first to really catch me off guard. He told me she got mad with him because he ""wouldn't be bi"". Which I thought was weird to share. Maybe he was trying to be relatable? I don't know. But it goes on. I shared my vape with him and after we made it back to his truck and we drove closer to my house we parked and chatted.

He must have told me at least five times that nicotine makes him horny. He got into how he has been so horny in general lately and now that it's over with his ex he thinks it's time to experiment. He shared a recent conquest and pried into whether or not l'd had any entanglements since being back in the city. I was a little coy but l've not been up to much anyway. The conversation just struck me as a conversation l'd have with a guy from tinder. Not one of my long time friends, and a straight one at that. My girl friends barely get the deets on my intimate life, my guy friends and I don't discuss it.

He had to head to work so he asked if I'd be comfortable with a hug, I said sure, leaned over and got a pretty tight squeeze.
I talked it out with my bestie, and she is living because she thinks it's obvious, but in my mind that interaction wasn't enough to convince me.
Especially with the Bi thing coming up earlier on.
However, I think for context I need to share that I'm a little naive to the advances of others. I can't tell when I'm being hit on until after l've walked away from the conversation, and more than once have I wound up going back to someone's place *honest to god* not realizing I was being invited for sexy time.

We've continued to talk and being horny has come up from him more than once. There was a message about ""wanting to hang out but it being late, and being stuck at work feeling tired and horny."" Which are not words I would put into a message to any of my friends. Straight or gay, male or female. I'd only tell that to someone I'm pursuing. So at this point I'm starting to feel very confused.

Last weekend we hung out. And it did my head in. Obviously there was a lot of nicotine makes me horny chat from him, and at one point he said he needed to lay off it for a bit because of that. He put his head back on the couch and his arms up over top. I noticed him glancing through the corner of his eye. There were actually multiple points throughout the night I caught him looking over at me from the corner of my view. I ordered food and he made a joke about buying him dinner beforehand. A lot of comments about how great the lighting in my room was for setting the mood (and that's been brought up in online conversation at least 4 times).

The body language was saying something. There were multiple points where he had shifted his body half towards me, half towards the front of the couch, and he did that thing where you have the arm closer to the other person up - we all know that thing. I swear he was about to lean in. And I got that from him a couple times throughout the night. There was actually a point where my heart was POUNDING - but I wasn't nervous. This wasn't a date. This is my friend. So I almost feel like I was picking that up from him. We talked a bit about dating life. I brought up being hairless probably doesn't help my dating life (I'm not a butch guy) and he said he thinks it's better. (Why would that be relevant to someone outside of my pool?)

When we were picking episodes from our binge fest he would ask to watch an episode after me just discussing how awkwardly sexual it was - and he brought up episodes featuring gay themes a couple of times. At a couple points in the night he also expressed a lot of curiosity surrounding a small bottle of cleaner many gay men have in their nightstand IYKYK knowing I had it, and at one point considered trying it. (This is for performance). The kicker was closer to the end of the night when he mentioned he'd way rather sleep with me than my ex. Thank you, gold star compliment, take notes.

But WOAH. So I took the maybe-maybe not bate and told him a story about a rando straight guy I met at a bar and how we went back to his house for beer (in my mind). He seemed to like that story. He stayed until 1 and we parted ways without anything happening, but holy tension. And that visit was sandwiched in between two super tight, super close, leg between leg hugs.
We've been talking regularly. He's actually a better boyfriend than a real one. I got a hope you had a good sleep and have a great day text this week. But the conversation still seems off for a conversation with a guy friend. More horny talk. Letting me know all he had to wear under his uniform was underwear, and I even explained jockstraps to him. (To which he expressed concern about access to everything)
There's been other stuff throughout our reconnecting like him pointing out a suggestive photo of a thigh tattoo missing from my instagram page (I archived this over 4 months ago y'all).

There's also been an insistence that I WILL get to find out if my room really does set the mood. As well as just a glaring preoccupation of whether or not I've gotten it in at any point. It's just been weird.

So what's my move? I'm REALLY confused. The boy who can't pick up on vibes feels like he's reeeeally getting the vibes. But the source is questionable. I like this guy, as a friend, and I respect my friendships. l'd never cross a boundary and quite frankly good friends are far more valuable to me than a lay. That being said, I'm not not down? I'm normally a little reserved, but he *is* someone I know and trust, and he's not a bad looking guy either. He would probably have to make 100% of the first move though. Not 80, not 90, 100. I'm fully aware I'm not living in a world where I'm the default, so l can't push it.

But knowing that he was Kyle's friend first, thinks Kyle is gross, and Kyle being who is would've jumped at the chance to fool around with Jason considering he has a history of sleeping with his close friends kind of makes me want to do it for the plot. I don't have anything serious going on right now, nor am I looking for anything from anyone. And I love nothing more than irony. Sleeping with or fooling around with Jason would be a pretty good confidence booster, it'd be fun, it'd be fulfilling because l'd feel safe and like I trust the person I'm naked with. And it would also give Kyle a secret universal middle finger, because Kyle sucks. :)

Spooky content for joy: I spent some time outside today enjoying the fall weather, leaves and Halloween decorations. I also browsed some pet Halloween costumes online. If you can’t find joy in a pug dressed like a hot dog, you need to reconsider your choices.  

Fruit or veg with every meal, one piece of cake a week: Coffee for breakfast, so kind of a miss there but otherwise got this.  

Maintenance: Over today. My work sent the ladies to the spa and to a fancy lunch so I let myself be a little too free with my intake.    

Don’t spend $ outside of preset weekly budget: On it. Turned down a nail appointment with some folks to stay in line here.     

Weigh in daily: Missed this am.   

Find a way to enjoy moving my body everyday: Got this today. 12/18 days. 

Journal for two minutes every morning: Missed this am but will get some journaling in after my shower. 12/18 days.  

Today's gratitude or laugh list: Today, I’m grateful for the folks I work with. I am valued and my hard work feels like it matters and that is very special. I laughed during some choice conversations with my coworkers about silly shit.         

Meditate (sensory grounding) for 5 minutes to combat hyper vigilance: Nailed this today.  

Self-care activity for today: I had a massage today, my second one ever. It was a very healing, grounding experience and a good reminder that my physical body needs more of my time, attention and care.

I’m currently going through hardship with my partner and would love some input on what i can do. I’ve never had a good strong male influence in my life even though i do have a father and he was present. I work 2 jobs my first is demolition second is doordashing im working on a third business of graphic design. I’m dating a woman a year older and she has been expressive of certain qualities i do not possess as a man. Yesterday i spent the entire day with her, i did need to work and i sacrificed doordashing to get out of negatives to be with her. We sat in the car for hours and then we went to her home and i did pass out on the couch for about an hour and when i woke up i felt anxious about work and told her i needed to go home and sleep, she was upset that i slept and didnt spend time with her and this has been a recurring issue with her that i pass out. She was watching reels with her mom while i slept and i brought that up and asked why she didn’t just wake me up or have me make a coffee, i understand that the way i delivered this made her feel disrespected. I am very stressed and i would love some advice, i wake up at 6:30 am usually mon to fri. After work i shower change eat spend some time with the girlfriend and get back to work 4-11:30 ish. She has been getting upset that i pass out on her and it’s been getting bad. I pass out on the freeway on my way home at 1-2am, been in a few accidents. By Gods grace i am here today. I work hard and a lot and i have to pay bills almost every day. So when we take time off it impacts me and her  financially if we’re not consistent. I try to be considerate of her ADHD, Hormones, and Trauma. (Please don’t take this as me bashing on her, i love her more than anything and i am trying to be the right man and recognize i have things to work on) when we take time off our responsibilities it’s usually because she doesnt feel like working or she’s going through a lot of emotions and i get that yet it’s hard not giving her the time bc she gets so upset and yet when i do sacrifice i end up treating her badly bc of my stress. The other day i was stressing over us not working enough and i know she’s behind on bills so we do need to work, im helping her work because she got an order that was big and in the meantime i had my work on aswell, i get an order while were shopping together but my service is down so im like totally focused on one thing at a time and while im trying to accept the order she’s trying to tell me about how some chips have less air meaning less fresh, i brushed her off like an asshole bc i was worried about my order and then she threatens to break up with me when were on the phone later..im really torn guys. I fell asleep lastnight and told her if we can get to work and stay on top of things then i can have more space for her and not feel stressed or anxious, if we can get to work and catch up on bills. She feels neglected and tells me i should figure it out as a man. I am trying. But she also expects me to be there for her and the math isnt adding up. She threatened to cancel our new lease lastnight. Im currently working and shes ignoring me, im behind on bills and need to make 800 in 3 days. So im a bit stressed. She is such an amazing woman and i am being a dickhead and im blunt, im a leo. Shes a cancer. Not that it matters but im stubborn and ignorant and i try so hard not to be but idk what to do men.

1g6zefg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1g6zefg/need_help/,Need help!,"I recently started talking again with a guy I met at a guitar store last year. He works at the guitar store and helped me find my first electric guitar. The entire time, he was getting guitars for me, plugging it in the amp, and would show off by playing complex riffs and was super helpful. I was immediately attracted to him.

Since then, we haven’t met in person, but have been communicating online. He once told me that the color I was wearing looked great on me. To me that seems like flirting. But that was back in April, and we didn’t talk again until last week. (I was in a relationship and when he saw the message about the color looking good on me, he made me unfollow him. I’m no longer with him, hence why I refollowed him and reached out to apologize for unfollowing.) 

We’ve been talking every day since, and it’s all been pleasant and platonic. But I just keep getting flirty vibes. But I could also just be projecting what I /want/ him to be feeling onto his words. I actually ended up taking a virtual guitar lesson from him and I was super nervous, and ended up not fully retaining it after it ended. But he kept saying I was awesome and that I did really well and I’m a quick learner. TBH, I don’t need guitar lessons to learn how to PLAY guitar, but just to improve. When we finished the lesson, he said that he was sorry to hear about my breakup, but I told him it was no big deal. Right after that though, he said “but I’m glad we’re in contact again, vibing, and playing guitar.” I’m not sure if he was flirting, or just shifting the topic so that things wouldn’t be awkward. But after that, he invited me to meet his band at this local event for musicians. He was gonna be at the thing anyway, and he is most likely trying to build an audience for his new band, so again I can’t figure out if it was like a soft asking out or not. But We’re going to be doing lessons every week. I would prefer to do them in person, because he does do in person lessons, but I live over an hour away and I don’t have my license, only my permit. 

To try and get some more insight, I posted something of a thirst trap to my story. Like it was pretty obviously a thirst trap. He liked it, but didn’t reply. A different guy that recently slid into my dms liked it, but he replied with heart eyes. So obviously one feels more obvious than the other, so it makes me wonder if guitar guy just liked it to be nice, or as a friend hyping me up. (Also, I’m like 85% sure he’s had a gf at some point, so he definitely could be attracted to me, like he’s not gay.)

BUT… he’s been posting pics on his story of his drink at a coffee shop, but both times, there’s been another cup, and this most recent time, there were long-ish fingernails (no polish that I could see). However, he hasn’t tagged anyone, nor posted a picture of anyone’s face. Idk if he has any siblings, roommates, or friends that are girls. I guess I should learn more about him before trying to ask him out, but family doesn’t really come up when we’re talking.

Part of me worries that he could just be flirting with me to get me to pay for lessons. He’s a musician and plays a lot of gigs, so I’m sure he has natural charisma and charm from that as well. But he sent me a selfie while chatting with me for seemingly no real reason, so that kinda made me think it was flirty. He also was talking about his cat and said something about his cat being a ladies’ man, and I was tempted to say something flirty about HIM being the ladies’ man, but decided against it bc I really don’t want to make unwanted or unrequited advances. I’m contemplating just saying something like “i might be overthinking it, but are you flirting with me a little bit?” But if the answer is no, I don’t think I could handle the embarrassment of continuing to take guitar lessons, but I don’t want it to seem like I stopped taking lessons BECAUSE he doesn’t like me back.

Basically, pls give me advice. Also, I apologize for being so wordy. I’m a pretty anxious person and I’m not very good at explaining things in short terms. I know I should probably just wait and feel things out, but I have such a crush on this guy and I don’t want to wait too long bc he could definitely find someone else.",1,1729305945.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False
1g6zd2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/shqip/comments/1g6zd2s/advice_for_learning_how_do_people_communicate/,Advice for learning: how do people communicate?,"pershendetje!

I am trying to learn some Shqip, but would like to confirm the manner in which people speak and communicate. 

I have heard that Albanians/ other Balkan area countries will not say “thank you” to everyone all the time like you might in England. Because it is used when you really mean it and appreciate the help someone gave, not just for doing their job which is expected.

Now I am learning with the sentence: “I want a coffee” “Dua nje kafe.” 

Would this be rude or too blunt of a way to ask, or is this the natural and normal way to ask for a drink at a restaurant or cafe. 

In English if you said “I want a coffee” you would at least also say “please”, or even better you would says “I would please like a coffee” instead of “I want”.

Basically: is Shqip a direct language where you state what you want and it is not rude to speak bluntly about things, where people say what they think? Or is there more nuance and “politeness” that has to be used. Maybe this example of “Dua nje kafe” is just for new beginners.

Stupid me, ""too busy"" to go to doc. Got to a point where brown liquid was coming out. Then started to heal. But then, plaque psoriasis started to appear around the bite, then slowly covered all my legs. And now im covered up to the shoulders. Hopefully it wont go up my face. According to dermatologist, its often triggered by strepto bacteria. So thats probably the infection i had.

To try to help: stopped alcohol, coffee, and focused on a more plant based diet. No improvements.

Dermatologist's 1st treatment was pretty basic cortisone cream. Did for 2 weeks. No improvements.

2nd treatment was a little stronger cream: betamethasone. I started to see improvements, but feels like my body just got accustomed to it, and stopped having any effects.

3rd treatment: phototherapy. Thing is, i live far from the dermatologist and needed to go there 3 times a week. So he decided to skip this one.

4th treatment: soriatane, taken orally. Started today. This gets stronger. Theres recurrent blood tests during the 4 months of this treatment. Hair loss, skin becoming very dry.

If it doesnt work...

5th treatment would be a pill that suppresses parts of the immune system.

6th treatment would be an injection. 

Now, i havent had this for years, so with the little glimpse i have, i cant imagine if you are stuck with this for a long time. It does afffect my morale. Im also extremely lucky to not have to pay for all this.

PCOS & IBS C,"I was diagnosed with PCOS 3 years ago. I had hirsutism, amenorrhoea (3 periods last year and 1 this year), bad cystic acne and chronic IBS-C. I have high androgens but no ovarian cysts. By far my most frustrating symptom is chronic constipation. If I don’t take laxatives I could go 5 days without passing a bm. I have to take polyethylene glycol daily in order to stay somewhat regular. The stomach distension and bloating make me look pregnant. I end up feeling very “full”, but never have the urge.

The only recommendation my first GP had was to take laxatives. I am in my 20’s and do not like the idea of just taking laxatives forever as a “solution” to this problem. I wanted to get to the root of it. He had no other offerings for me. I switched GPs and upon the discussion of my PCOS, asked earnestly “why would you want a period?” Like are you kidding me? I was adamant about getting a referral to a gyno, so she gave me one. 

I saw the gyno who encouraged birth control. I was very hesitant because I really don’t like the idea of taking more hormones. I read the book by Lara Bryden which is adamant that birth control messes up your system. Alas- I submitted due to the endometriosis risk. I’m not really sure how this sub feels about the book, but I guess it didn’t really help me much either. I ended up compromising on SLYND because it’s an anti-androgen and had good reviews from some reddit cysters (thank you). It cleared my acne and I don’t seem to have any side effects. 

This year I started a low fodmap over the course of 5 or so months with a dietician. It seemed to help a bit with the bloating, however the constipation remained more or less the same. I continue to eat low fodmap. I eat mostly vegetarian and recently introduced fish. I drink lots of water, and take probiotics, vit D, omega 3, B12 and vit C.  

I started taking dihydroberberine 3 times a day which suppressed my appetite and reduced bloating. I ended up losing 5 lbs. My bmi is currently 22.

Then alas in mid August I was blessed by the motility gods and spontaneously from August 24th-October 1st my constipation was gone… I felt like a completely new person. I got a taste of life on the other side. I could not believe how much not being constipated improved my mental health. 

On October 1st it got bad again. And not just like a little bad but VERY bad. I’ve become obsessive about “what it could be” that temporarily fixed my digestion:

My hypotheses:

* I took a tolerance break from dihydroberberine around Aug 29th for two weeks. I stopped taking it again a couple days ago to test but nothing changed
* My caffeine and dark chocolate intake increased around October so I was thinking that perhaps my cortisol increased from the caffeine? I am currently experimenting with cutting coffee (horrible) and chocolate to see if I notice a difference

My stress levels are actually comparatively pretty low right now then before August. So what is it?? I feel a bit like that character in “Under the Silver Lake” who is nuts and trying to unscramble the children’s maze on the side of the old cereal box. 

Today I noticed that my hair is thinning a lot which drove me to write this dissertation of self pity.

If anyone has any advice PLEASE let me know. These symptoms are seriously impacting my mental health. I am feeling very alone because it has been such a battle to get a doctor to take me seriously.

I’ve tried everything (I think) Exercise/pillows/pills/distractions the only thing that seems to work is  propanol and trazodone. Melatonin gets me sleep but I’m not really down with taking pills all the time. That’s never been me. I currently today have made the switch to cbd and cannabis products. 

I recently switched jobs. From being a local sort supervisor at ups (5-10pm) to a Caltrans landscape maintenance worker. (6am-3pm) I hated it. My sleep problem came up there about the third week in. I would close my eyes but I just wouldn’t fall asleep. This persisted for about a month. I was completely exhausted all day at work. 

I had a short attention span and my muscles hurt. Then the second month came around and that’s when the shaking started I would now be awake and shake. It was the worst. (The shaking has since gone away) Now sometimes I get heat flashes. That I combat with a wet towel. I quit Caltrans but it’s still happening!! 

I’ve seen a doctor, I’ve done labs and everything seems fine.  I’ve several therapist and they tell me it’s anxiety (duh) but I thought it would go away after a couple of days not keep going. I cut the problem out so I don’t see what the problem is. Most night now I only get about 4 hours ish of sleep. It sucks . It just feels like fight or flight mode constantly and exhausting. I’m Agitated and on edge but overall exhausted. When I lay down and begin to try and sleep my body doesn’t seem to want to click over to rest-full dream state. It’ll sometimes jerk itself awake. I absolutely hate this. (It’s almost like saying no you don’t deserve this)
Sometimes I’ll just sit there and listen to my heart beat. It even hurts sometimes when I wake up. 


I used to drink a lot of coffee and energy drinks and I was fine. I was weening down gradually to about one a day. I’m currently still at that. 

I’m hoping other people have gone through this that can guide me in the right direction for treatment. I feel like a shell of a person when I used to be really fun and happy go lucky. 

Please anything helps. I feel like I’m at the end of my rope.

When she woke, the string of memory clung to her like the Olden’s sap. Confused at her surroundings, feeling out of place and adrift, it took a precious long time before she came fully to herself to rise from the depths of Sil’s bed. Instead of the tense season of running from the Protector’s domain, she was in a safe, soft bed, feeling very much like she did not deserve the sleep. Oh well.

The longer she played Tianna, the more her old memories and questions returned to plague her. Maybe she was slipping too far into her old self. Sarrinare laughed her braying laughter in her ear as Mertle splashed cold water onto her face.

She had intended for a quick nap to recover some of her strength before heading out, as would befit the haggard Tianna. Instead, she’d missed the day. Coffee waited for her, stone cold on the table. Still, shame to waste it.

The enchantment held, her armlet’s hot to the touch and its runes glowing faintly in the early-evening gloom. Three, maybe four bells left before the glamour began fading. With little heart for it, she dressed and headed back out into the cold. Every step forward helped Tianna reassert herself in her bones and the cobwebs of old memory fade.

Lucian… how to play Lucian tonight? A cautious snake at the best of times, the man could give an aelir’matar reason to be wary. Always poking. Always prodding. Always bloody inferring secrets from every little thing she said or did. And that infuriating half-smile of his that neither confirmed or denied a single word coming out of his mouth.

How Sil could deal with him and not punch the sleaze, Mertle couldn’t begin to imagine.

And now she had little time for his games. To give in and play them altogether was to tumble headfirst down a very steep incline with a lot of jagged bits at the bottom. If she allowed him a moment’s control of the conversation—

Someone grabbed her arm and roughly yanked her sideways. A kick to her feet scythe them out from under her and she found herself down in dirty snow, in a foul smelling alley. A knife pressed to her neck and a hand covered her mouth. Calloused. Rough. Smelling of soap.

“Search her,” a hushed voice—a man’s hushed voice—commanded to someone to the side.

Other rough hands dug under her coat and cloak to grope at her and ransacked her pockets. Her arms, however, they left free.

Sloppy work.

A knife slipped into her palm from her sleeve. The man atop her was too confident that a blade at her throat was enough to keep her docile. She’d been too involved in her own thoughts, too drawn out and fuzzy with poor sleep, or else some common thieves wouldn’t have gotten the drop on her.

If she cut this oaf’s throat, that would lead to questions when she showed up covered in blood at the Guild. It might give Lucian some pause, now she thought of it.

Cut a throat in Valen, and sooner or later the city’s constabulary came around asking questions and looking very interested at a lot of things they shouldn’t be interested in. She’d need to kill all of these men. Unfortunately, she doubted there were only the two on her.

One slash upwards cuts the hand’s tendon. A second slashed the man across the face as he reeled back. A kick out got her out from the second’s attention. If they’d wanted her dead, they would’ve cut her throat prior to stealing her valuables.

No, this was well-thought out, so she had some heartbeats before their intentions turned bloody.

In a scrabble, she got to her feet and kicked out the bleeding man. Her boot caught him in the mouth just as he drew breath to shout. It toppled him back, at least some teeth knocked down his throat.

A glance around showed two… no, three more men. They’d dragged her into the narrow gap between two buildings, grabbed off the side street she’d been using to move easier between Valen’s layers. Thuggish. Large and brawny. One of them pulled back his bleeding friend.

Entrance covered expertly by two of them. The one groping her had pulled out his knife but hadn’t come forward. Stumbling slightly, the bleeding man came to his feet and brandished a cudgel in his good hand. Odd that. They were all slow to cuss at her and demand she hand over her weapon. If anything…

They were waiting for something different.

There was none of the bluster of thugs cornering and outnumbering prey. If anything, they were more wary of her now, much more than warranted.

Her eyes met hard, disciplined stares. No panic or hesitation there. She’d ran with plenty of thugs and bandits to know when something stank. Either she’d run into into the most brazen thieves in Valen, or these men weren’t what they appeared to be.

*I’m being tested,* she realised with a jolt. For what?

…For fire.

Mertle broken into cold sweat as realisation dawned. They were spread out and advanced on her cautiously, expecting fire and ready to react to it. They’d known exactly who and, more importantly, what they were assaulting.

“Do you have the barest idea of who you’ve laid hands on?” she blurted out, bluster trying to hide the growing panic she felt. She drew herself out of the half-crouch, mimicking a pyromancer’s straight-backed stance. “Of what I could do to you?”

Far chance of them backing down. If anything, now they leered. These weren’t thugs. These were soldiers, now growing confident that she wouldn’t be able to back up her threats.

Maybe she could take all four with two knives. Maybe. A quick glance up showed they were hidden completely beneath the interlocking eaves of the buildings, in the rain gutter. If someone were observing, it couldn’t be too closely. If she cut their throat and set them ablaze somehow, then maybe it could pass for a pyromancer’s work.

Even she knew that wouldn’t be the case.

Her second knife dropped in her off-hand. Nothing for it then. Her cover would be as good as blown now that she’d failed the most basic test for a pyromancer. Best to kill the oafs and then see if she could manage the passage to the shop. From there, she and Tummy could probably make it out of Valen before the Guard came in force for them.

So much for the captain’s assurances and apologies. How she’d wish she could knock out that flint-eyed cunt’s teeth.

No reason to fear for her life. If she were an impostor, then their orders would likely be to bring her in for some real questions. She could fight, at least for a time, with no care for life or limb. She could down one before they judged her dangerous enough to take seriously.

In the gutter there was only room for two of them to advance at once. And they were unimpressed of her bluster. She would at least make them regret the temerity.

Before either of the two made up their mind, she lunged at the closest. One knife flashed up towards his wrist, the other aimed at the throat. A clean, quick kill if he were careless.

The man exploded before her knife rose in the killing arc. In the dark of the alley, the explosion blinded her and the backwash of searing heat sent her reeling. The soldier was blasted off his feet and thrown bodily against the wall to slide with a wet crunch of snapping bones.

Her eyebrows were singed off and her face hot and tender.

The second tried rushing her. Or maybe he was trying to get to his companion. Mertle reacted on instinct and kicked out, aiming through the blobs of after-flash for his groin. Fire erupted beneath the man to throw him out of the alley with a detonating crack like thunder. He crashed through the eaves above. A torrent of debris rained down on Mertle’s head.

Before she fully regained her sight from the flashes of light, the other two were gone, melted out into the night. Only the burned ones were left behind, both crumpled against walls, moaning in pain. The stench of burnt hair hung in the air.

Fire had kissed her as well and she could feel skin blistering on her fingers where the blast had been closest. People crowded at the mouth of the gutter, drawn by the spectacle.

Mertle drew herself up as the first muttered questions arose. Concerned voices. Someone calling out for a healer. Others for the constabulary.

She patted down the smoking patches of her dress and hair and stumbled out of the dark to meet the onlookers.

“Will someone get the guard, please?” she asked in her best and most annoyed Tianna voice. “Before I get a mind to finish these scum off?”

Someone from the gathering crowd peeled quickly away, without raising any alarm or calling out. Mertle got a glimpse of them rushing away without a glance back. In the direction of the elevators, towards the Fortress.

Others asked if she was alright. She shrugged away their concern and sneered.

“Perfectly fine. Get away from me.” She spat some blood on the ground. Must’ve bit the inside of her cheek when knocked down. “I expected Valen be more civilised. Filth dragging respectable women in the gutter? Disgusting.” A well aimed kicked at the first man got him stirring. “See to them, will you? I don’t need their kind of blood on my hands.”

After all, they were only soldiers doing their job.

With another sniff of annoyance, she pushed through the crowd and walked away, still aware that she was smoking from some smouldering patch of her dress. It would leave an impression.

She’d been seen. She’d been heard.

Best she were somewhere else before anyone came through asking unpleasant questions that would eat up whatever time she had left of the enchantment.

And best she tried to figure out why two men exploded out of the blue. She suspected Sil’s bracelet, but that made very little sense. If anyone could figure out how to trap offensive channelling into an item, they’d buy an empire.

She threw one final glance over her shoulder and thought she recognized a face in the crowd, half-lit by spritelight. No, not the face. The knot where the stranger’s arm was missing. It was gone in a moment, onlookers rushing to help the hurt *thieves.*

Maybe she’d imagined it. The prickling on the back of her neck assured her she hadn’t.",0,1729305188.0,HFY,2,0.5,False

I get approached by men everywhere but my life is super busy and I only feel motivated to make time for someone if I’m actually into them. 

I met this guy on Bumble (31M) and I’m (26F). He asked for my number then ended the convo on Bumble ( I can’t see his account anymore) he messaged me on WhatsApp and I usually like to meet for a coffee first and it went great then we organised a first date which we spent the whole day together and ended up having sex ( I know it’s too early haha). He has been consistent and we will go on a third date next week. I asked him if he has any other social media and his response was “I do” then I said do u use insta he said “yeah send me yours and I’ll add u” he never did and it’s been days. Now before when I tried to search his name on social media it won’t come up and now he’s on my insta suggestion list which means he did search up my name but didn’t add me. I never asked him again

I’ve had experiences with guys before where 3-4months in and I found out that the whole time there were seeing other ppl and were hiding things. I guess I’ve issues with communicating what I want and I just end up losing interest and cutting things off, I also do it cause I feel like I don’t have time to waste with all the stress I’ve. Now with this guy when he unmatched me on the app and doesn’t want me to see any of his social accounts I can’t help it but think he isn’t straightforward. I don’t want to judge someone based on my past experiences, so I want to get ppl advice on how to understand men better in general and communicate my needs without coming off too strongly?

1g6yzo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flirting/comments/1g6yzo2/need_help/,Need help!,"I (23F) recently started talking again with a guy (25?M) I met at a guitar store last year. He works at the guitar store and helped me find my first electric guitar. The entire time, he was getting guitars for me so I didn’t have to get up, plugging it in the amp, and would show off by playing complex riffs before handing it to me, and was super helpful. He also threw in a bunch of free stuff, but maybe that was bc it was my birthday. Anyway, I was immediately attracted to him.

Since then, we haven’t met in person, but have been in communication online. He once told me that the color I was wearing looked great on me. To me that seems like flirting. But that was back in April, and we didn’t talk again until earlier this week. (I was in a relationship and when my (now) ex saw the message about the color looking good on me, he made me unfollow him. I’m no longer with my (now) ex, hence why I refollowed guitar guy and reached out to apologize for unfollowing.) 

We’ve been talking every day since, and it’s all been pleasant and platonic, but I just keep getting flirty vibes. I could just be projecting what I want him to feel onto his words though. I ended up taking an online guitar lesson from him and I was super nervous, but it went well. We ended up going over the time, but he said it was okay. He kept saying I was awesome (seemed unrelated to my guitar playing), that I did really well, and I’m a quick learner. I don’t need guitar lessons to learn how to play, just to improve. When we finished, he said that he was sorry to hear about my breakup, but I told him it was no big deal. Right after that, he said “but I’m glad we’re in contact again, vibing, and playing guitar.” I’m not sure if he was flirting, or just shifting the topic so that things wouldn’t be awkward. Then, he invited me to meet his band at this local event for musicians. He was gonna be at the thing anyway, and he’s most likely trying to build an audience for his new band, so I can’t figure out if it was something he’d offer to any other person he gives lessons to or not. 

But we’re going to be doing lessons every week. I would prefer to do them in person, but I live over an hour away and I don’t have my license, only my permit. But anyway, he ended the lesson with casual conversation and he once again said that if I ever needed anything, whether a guitar question, or just want to talk about my day, he was happy to talk with me. He’s said that a couple times when messaging me, that he was always available if I wanted to talk about anything.

To try and get some answers, I posted a lil thirst trap to my story. It was pretty obviously a thirst trap. He liked it, but didn’t reply. A different guy that recently slid into my dms liked it AND replied with heart eyes. That felt more obvious, so it makes me wonder if guitar guy just liked it to be nice, or as a friend hyping me up.

BUT… he’s been posting pics on his story of his coffee, but both times, there’s been another cup, and this most recent time, there were long-ish fingernails (no polish that I could see). However, he hasn’t tagged anyone in the posts, nor posted a picture of anyone’s face. He isn’t tagged in any pictures with girls either. Idk if he has any siblings, roommates, or friends that are girls. I guess I should learn more about him before trying to ask him out, but family doesn’t really come up when we’re talking.

Part of me worries that he could just be flirting with me to get me to pay for lessons. He’s a musician and plays a lot of gigs, so I’m sure he has natural charisma from that. He sent me a selfie while chatting with me for seemingly no reason, so that made me think it was flirty. I’m contemplating  saying something like “i might be overthinking it, but are you flirting with me a little bit?” But if the answer is no, I don’t think I could handle the embarrassment of continuing to take guitar lessons, but I don’t want it to seem like I stopped  BECAUSE he doesn’t like me back.

Basically, pls give me advice. Also, I apologize for being so wordy. I’m a pretty anxious person and I’m not very good at explaining things in short terms. I know I should probably just wait and feel things out, but I have such a crush on this guy and I don’t want to wait too long bc he could definitely find someone else.",1,1729304539.0,Flirting,0,1.0,False

What I mean is, obviously there are successful coffee shops all over the country. I'm thinking about opening up a place in an area of Seattle where there is no great shortage of coffee shops, but definitely demand. My plan would be to try to access a great amount of potential drive-by customers.  But there is no place to make it a drive-thru or have a line of cars, but there is a place where four or five cars could park out front fairly easily. My thought is either have people come in or perhaps offer car hop service for lack of a better term. It would be a fairly small place with maybe a few tables and a roll-up garage door that would open it up to the parking area. I would probably be doing it as a movable cart So it could even be put forward just inside the roll up door .

I know years ago there were plenty of shops where people would park like in a little strip mall and walk in and stand in line to get their drink and back in their car. But there's so many drive-throughs around I don't know if anyone cares to do that anymore. 

However, it's the main arterial into downtown and there's really only one Starbucks shop and drive-thru several miles up the road. After a couple of miles, upwind, there are some drive-throughs but there is a long stretch all the way into near North Seattle and downtown and through downtown to the south where there really isn't any alternative, and plenty of people who would be leaving their house and heading south without even passing the ones to the north. 

Point being, there's a long stretch with a lot of traffic and a lot of people going to work with no drive-through competition. 

So my thought is hit that morning traffic from maybe 6:30 or 7:00 till 11:00 and then run it for a few more hours or into the evening as a regular coffee shop. 

I know there are apps where people will order before they get there and go through a drive-thru based on their pre-order. I think those aren't too complicated to set up for a private business if you pay a little bit.  Probably even apps where you can pay that way and all you would have to do is hop out of your car and grab your drink or have somebody run your drink out to you. 

So I'm just wondering if anyone has a business like this or any experience or thoughts. My fear would be that that just is too much for people that are used to drive through, but, there aren't any other drive-throughs on this stretch heading south and it's all controlled access. I don't think there's any on the other side of the street either but if there are it wouldn't be easy to get to. And it's a very populous area with a lot of money and sophisticated urbanites that like good coffee. 

I've got coffee experience and my sister used to run a drive-thru and was a very skilled expert, so not to worry about making sure the product is good. Just wondering about business. Any thoughts appreciated.",1,1729304163.0,barista,6,0.57,False

I think I am going to return the 3.4oz because I am not sure I like it anymore :( It kind of smells like sunscreen-gone-bad now.  Burberry Goddess- I like it some days when I sniff in the store, then I don't. I'm not a big fan of the lavender note and would like to avoid any lavender to be honest. I thought I'd love it since it has vanilla in every note but nope...
* **VS Bare Vanilla-** Love. Best body spray.
* **Kayali 28**- Not a fan AT ALL. I don't know if it's the musk or what, but I do not see how it's meant to be a perfumified version of Bare Vanilla by VS.
* **Ariana Cloud**- Not really a ""vanilla"", but this is the perfume I find myself liking the most at the moment. But I want something more vanilla that I can layer with vanilla everything.
* **VS Tease Creme Cloud**- This one is pretty nice but I feel again that the vanilla is lacking a bit. I like it for the most part though.
* **Skylar Vanilla Sky**- I do like this one, but maybe a bit less coffee.
* **Sabrina Carpenter Sweet Tooth**- I love this one. I mean it's pretty much Warm Vanilla Sugar which is another favorite of mine! I just wish it lasted longer.

With those in mind, does anyone have any recommendations? I'm reaching my wits end :(",1,1729304158.0,FemFragLab,9,1.0,False
1g6yuuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1g6yuuz/job_was_filled_but_they_still_want_to_chat/,"Job was filled but they still want to chat, Industry change... pseudo interview?","So I recently graduated from a engineering program and have been working at the same place I did my internship. I did at all at one company because of covid, and couldnt find another job. Anyways now I'm full time and permanent after graduating however the management is not the best and its pretty uninteresting work. Mostly just a machinery cad monkey and project manager. I recently have been applying to new jobs, not desperate but more so looking to find the right opportunity.

Anyways, recently was replied to for one of the applications I submitted at a small consulting firm. Its in a different field (hvac), it sounds like a genuinely more interesting job however reading the technical requirements most of it is stuff I have zero experience with. They sent me an email saying they unfortunately filled the position I applied for but we're down to ""meet and chat regardless of an opportunity"" if I wanted to and said they may have more positions in the early new year.

I've taken them up on the offer to meet thinking it would be a quick 15-30min chat however they scheduled a 60min meeting at a coffee shop. I'm assuming they obviously dont do this with every applicant but I got mixed signals about what the purpose of the chat was. Would this be more of an informal interview to follow up later with if they thought I was a good fit? Has anyone had similar ""chats"" in the past? What was the format like, do I dress up or just play it casual?

Since this is a different field, I want to be honest about my experience but what are ways I can sell my self in this new field and have a conversation if I have zero experience consulting in this field or in consulting in general. They also referred to this as a ""first chat"" which has me thinking it is more of an interview and just overthinking it.

Any tips from similar experiences would be appreciated!",1,1729304090.0,careeradvice,1,0.67,False
