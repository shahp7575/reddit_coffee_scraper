1lbyzrr,https://www.catkittyfood.com/how-do-you-know-if-your-cat-has-ear-mites/,How Do You Know If Your Cat Has Ear Mites,"**How Do You Know If Your Cat Has Ear Mites**

Ear mites are a common issue in cats that can lead to discomfort and health problems if left untreated. Understanding how do you know if your cat has ear mites is crucial for timely intervention. One of the first signs to look for is excessive scratching of the ears or surrounding areas. Cats often try to alleviate the itching sensation caused by these tiny parasites.

Another indicator of ear mites is the presence of dark, crumbly debris in your cat's ears. This material is often compared to coffee grounds and is a result of the mites feeding on the skin and earwax. If you notice this debris during a routine check, it’s a strong sign that ear mites may be present.

Besides scratching and debris, observe your cat for signs of irritation. Frequent shaking of the head or tilting it to one side can indicate discomfort. Additionally, an unpleasant odor emanating from the ear can suggest an infection, which may have developed due to the mites. It is advisable to monitor your cat closely for these symptoms.

If you suspect your cat has ear mites, you should schedule a visit with your veterinarian. They can confirm the diagnosis through an ear examination and may take a sample to identify the mites under a microscope. Early detection and treatment are key to relieving your cat's suffering and preventing further health issues.

In summary, knowing how do you know if your cat has ear mites involves observing scratching behaviors, checking for ear debris, and noting any signs of irritation or odor. Taking action quickly can help restore your cat’s comfort and health.

1lbyxh3,https://youtu.be/u4YysdDeht4,3 Very Scary TRUE Tinder Date From Truck Stops Horror Stories,"# ""A Slice of Fear"":

I’d been chatting with this guy on Tinder for a couple of weeks. His name was Jack, a truck driver who spent most of his life crisscrossing the country. He had a rugged charm in his messages, sharing stories about late-night drives and small-town diners he’d found along the way. His profile showed a guy with a scruffy beard, leaning against a massive rig, a wide grin on his face. I thought it was kind of cool, different from the usual city guys I matched with. When he suggested meeting at a truck stop just off the highway, I hesitated for a second. It wasn’t exactly romantic, but he said it was convenient since he was passing through. “They’ve got a great diner,” he texted. “Best pie you’ll ever taste.” I figured a public place like that was safe enough, so I agreed.When I pulled into the truck stop, the lot was nearly empty. A few big rigs loomed in the shadows, their engines giving off a low, steady hum. The diner’s neon sign flickered, casting a weak glow over the cracked pavement. My headlights caught a figure standing near a black truck, and I recognized Jack from his photos. He was taller than I expected, broad-shouldered, wearing a flannel shirt and jeans. He waved me over, his smile warm and welcoming. “Hey, you made it!” he called out, his voice deep and gravelly. I parked my car and walked over, my sneakers crunching on the gravel. We hugged, and I caught a whiff of diesel mixed with cheap aftershave. “Ready for that pie?” he asked, gesturing toward the diner.Inside, the diner felt stuck in time. The air smelled of stale coffee and fried onions, and the linoleum floor was scuffed and faded. A jukebox in the corner sat silent, its lights dim. The waitress, an older woman with tired eyes and a nametag that read “Doris,” poured coffee at the counter. A lone trucker sat in a booth, hunched over a plate of eggs, his cap pulled low. We slid into a red vinyl booth by the window, the seat creaking under us. Jack ordered coffee and apple pie for both of us, his voice easy and confident. “You’re gonna love this place,” he said, leaning back. “It’s got character.”We started talking, and at first, it felt normal. He told me about hauling freight through the Midwest, the long hours, the sunrises he’d seen from his cab. His stories were vivid, full of details about greasy spoons and quirky roadside stops. But as he talked, I noticed his eyes—dark and intense, like they were studying me. He’d pause mid-sentence, his gaze lingering on my hands, my neck, my hair. It wasn’t flirty; it felt like he was sizing me up. “You okay?” I asked, forcing a smile to keep things light. He blinked, like I’d snapped him out of a trance. “Yeah, just thinking how you’re even prettier in person,” he said, but his tone was flat, almost mechanical. My stomach twisted, a small knot of unease forming, but I pushed it down. Maybe he was just nervous, I told myself.The pie arrived, warm and golden, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream melting into the crust. I took a bite, trying to focus on the sweet, cinnamon flavor, but Jack barely touched his. He kept glancing out the window toward his truck, his fingers tapping the table. “You ever been inside a rig?” he asked suddenly, his eyes locking onto mine again. I laughed, trying to shake off the growing tension. “No, but I bet it’s like a little apartment on wheels.” His smile returned, but it didn’t feel right—it was too wide, too sharp. “Exactly,” he said. “I’ll show you after we eat. It’s my home away from home.”I nodded, but the knot in my stomach tightened. The diner felt safe, with Doris wiping down the counter and the trucker in his booth, but the idea of going out to his truck, alone in the dark lot, made my pulse quicken. I tried Roswell, I was scared. My heart was pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears. “Let go of me!” I shouted, my voice cracking with fear. I twisted with all my strength, driving my knee into his groin. He grunted, doubling over, his grip loosening just enough for me to wrench free. I stumbled out of the cab, my hands shaking so badly I could barely grab the door handle. I hit the pavement running, my sneakers slapping against the gravel, my breath coming in short, panicked gasps. The diner’s lights glowed ahead like a beacon, and I didn’t dare look back to see if he was following.I burst through the diner door, nearly colliding with a table. Doris looked up from the counter, her eyes wide. “Call the police!” I gasped, my voice trembling. “He’s dangerous! He’s got a knife!” The trucker in the booth turned, staring at me, but I didn’t care. Doris didn’t hesitate; she grabbed the phone behind the counter and dialed 911, her hands steady as she spoke to the operator. “Yes, ma’am,Hobbes, I collapsed into a booth, my chest heaving, trying to catch my breath. Doris handed me a glass of water and told me to sit tight, her voice calm but firm. “Police are on the way, hon. You’re safe now.”Minutes dragged like hours. I kept my eyes on the door, my body tense, expecting Jack to come charging in. Finally, sirens wailed in the distance, and red and blue lights flashed across the lot. Two officers approached the truck, their guns drawn, shouting orders. I watched from the diner window, my heart in my throat, as they climbed into the cab. One of them emerged a few minutes later, leading a woman—gagged, her hands bound, her eyes wide with terror. Another officer had Jack in handcuffs, his face blank, his eyes cold as they passed mine through the glass. He didn’t struggle, didn’t look at me, just walked with his head down.An officer came inside to talk to me, his face grim. “You’re lucky you got out,” he said, sitting across from me. “There was a woman in that box, tied up and beaten. She’s alive, but she’s in bad shape. He’s done this before.” My knees buckled as I sank back into the booth, the reality of it hitting me. I’d been inches from being his next victim. Later, I learned from the news that Jack was a serial kidnapper, targeting women through dating apps, luring them to isolated places like truck stops. The woman in the photo on his dashboard was another victim, one who hadn’t escaped. I couldn’t sleep for weeks, haunted by the sound of that whimper, the sight of that bloodstain, and the memory of his cold, predatory stare. I’d trusted him, ignored my instincts, and nearly paid the ultimate price.Every time I pass a truck stop now, my chest tightens, my hands shake, and I hear that faint, desperate sound from the box in my mind. I don’t use Tinder anymore. The thought of another date, another stranger, makes my skin crawl. I was lucky, but I’ll never forget how close I came to disappearing into the dark.

  


# ""Trapped in the Cab"":

I’d been on Tinder for a few months, swiping through profiles, hoping to find someone who clicked. Most guys were either boring or too forward, but then I matched with a man I’ll call Tom. His profile stood out—rugged, with a warm grin under a worn trucker hat, and his bio was simple: “Road warrior, love a good story and a good meal.” We messaged back and forth for weeks. He was funny, asking about my favorite books and telling me tales of his life as a truck driver—long nights on the highway, quirky diners, and sunrises over empty roads. When he suggested meeting at a truck stop just off the interstate near my town, I thought it was odd but not a dealbreaker. It was a public place, with a 24-hour diner and plenty of people around. I figured it was safe enough.I drove to the truck stop, my car’s tires crunching on the gravel lot. The place was massive, a sprawling maze of eighteen-wheelers parked in neat rows, their chrome glinting under the lot’s floodlights. The diner sat at the center, its neon sign buzzing faintly, casting a warm glow through the windows. The air carried the heavy scent of diesel mixed with fried onions from the kitchen. I parked near the entrance, checking my reflection in the rearview mirror before heading inside. My stomach fluttered with nerves, but I brushed it off as first-date jitters.Tom was already there, sitting in a vinyl booth near the back, his flannel shirt rolled up to reveal tanned forearms. He looked up from his coffee and smiled, standing to greet me. “Hey, you made it!” he said, his voice warm as he pulled me into a quick hug. He smelled faintly of leather and soap.“Yeah, this place is hard to miss,” I said, sliding into the booth across from him. The table was slightly sticky, and a jukebox in the corner played an old country song, barely audible over the clink of dishes and low chatter from other diners—mostly truckers in caps and work boots.We ordered food—pancakes with extra syrup for me, a meatloaf special with mashed potatoes for him. The waitress, a woman with tired eyes and a name tag reading “Doris,” scribbled our order and shuffled off. Tom leaned forward, elbows on the table, and asked about my job at the bookstore. I told him about helping customers find obscure novels and how I loved the smell of old books. He listened intently, nodding, his eyes crinkling when he laughed at my story about a customer who insisted on finding a book by its cover color.“You’re passionate about it,” he said, cutting into his meatloaf. “That’s cool. Not many people love what they do.”“What about you?” I asked. “You like driving trucks?”He shrugged, chewing thoughtfully. “It’s freedom, you know? Just me, the road, and the radio. But it gets lonely sometimes.” His eyes met mine, and I felt a spark—maybe this was going somewhere.We kept talking, swapping stories. He told me about a tiny diner in Nevada with the best pie he’d ever tasted and a time he broke down in the desert with no cell service. I shared how I’d once gotten lost on a hiking trail and had to backtrack for hours. The conversation flowed easily, and I started to relax, sipping my coffee as the diner’s fluorescent lights buzzed overhead.But as we finished eating, the place started to clear out. Doris and another waitress began wiping down counters, flipping chairs onto tables. The jukebox went silent. Tom glanced at his watch. “Want to take a walk outside? Stretch our legs?”I hesitated for a split second but nodded. “Sure, sounds good.”We stepped into the parking lot, where the air was cooler, filled with the low hum of idling trucks and the faint chirp of crickets. The lot was quieter now, with fewer rigs than when I’d arrived. We walked along the edge, passing trailers stacked with crates and tarps. Tom pointed out a few, telling me what they might be hauling—lumber, produce, maybe car parts. His knowledge impressed me, but I noticed he kept glancing around, his eyes darting to the shadows between trucks. I told myself he was just checking his surroundings, but a knot formed in my stomach.We reached the far end of the lot, where the lights were dimmer, and he stopped by a dark blue rig, its cab towering over us. “This is mine,” he said, patting the door. “Want to see inside? I’ve got some souvenirs from my routes—pretty neat stuff.”My instincts screamed no. The truck was parked far from the diner, isolated, with no other people nearby. But he was smiling, his tone so casual, I didn’t want to seem paranoid. “Maybe we can just stay out here,” I said, forcing a smile.“Come on, it’s more comfortable inside,” he said, his hand brushing mine as he stepped closer. “Just for a minute.”My heart raced, but I didn’t want to offend him. Against my better judgment, I nodded. He opened the passenger door, helping me climb the high step into the cab. The interior was spotless—too spotless for a trucker’s life. No coffee cups, no maps, not even a stray receipt. Just a faint chemical smell, like bleach or cleaning spray, that made my nose wrinkle. A small black bag sat on the floor, its zipper half-open, revealing something metallic inside. My pulse quickened.Tom climbed in on the driver’s side, shutting the door with a heavy thud. The tinted windows made the outside world feel distant, like we were in a bubble. He turned on the overhead light, casting harsh shadows across his face. “So, what do you think?” he asked, gesturing to the cab.“It’s… clean,” I said, my voice tighter than I meant it to be.He laughed, but it sounded forced. “Yeah, I like to keep it tidy.” He leaned back, watching me. “So, you live close by, right? You said you’re in that little apartment complex off Route 17?”I hadn’t told him that. I’d only mentioned living in town. My skin prickled. “Uh, yeah, something like that,” I said, lying. “I’ve got roommates, though. They’re probably waiting up for me.”His smile faded slightly, and his eyes narrowed, like he was studying me. “Roommates, huh? That’s nice. Must be cozy.”The air felt thick, and that black bag on the floor seemed to stare at me. I shifted, my hand inching toward my pocket where my phone was. “I should probably head out soon,” I said, trying to sound calm.“What’s the rush?” he said, his voice low. He reached over, his hand brushing my knee. “We’re having fun, aren’t we?”I pulled away, my back pressing against the door. “I just have an early morning,” I said, my fingers closing around the door handle.Then I saw it clearly—the metal in the bag was a knife, its blade glinting under the cab’s light. My heart stopped. “I need to go,” I said, yanking the handle, but the door was locked.Tom’s hand shot out, grabbing my wrist. “Stay,” he said, his voice no longer friendly. “We’re not done.”“Let go!” I shouted, twisting free, but he lunged, pinning me against the seat. His face was inches from mine, his breath hot. “You’re not going anywhere,” he hissed, his other hand reaching for the black bag.I screamed, the sound trapped in the cab’s tight space. My hands scrambled, finding the unlock button on the door panel. I hit it and shoved the door open, tumbling out onto the gravel. Pain shot through my knee as I landed, but I scrambled to my feet, running toward the diner. Behind me, the truck’s engine roared to life, headlights blinding me as Tom gunned it.I dove behind a nearby trailer, my breath ragged, as his truck screeched past, tires kicking up dust. I fumbled for my phone, realizing I’d dropped it in the cab during the struggle. My only hope was to reach the diner. I sprinted, my shoes slipping on the gravel, the neon sign growing closer. I burst through the door, nearly colliding with Doris, who was sweeping the floor.“Help!” I gasped, my voice shaking. “He’s trying to hurt me!”Doris dropped her broom, her eyes wide. “Who? What’s going on?”“The guy I was with—Tom! He’s got a knife!” I pointed toward the lot, my hands trembling.She grabbed a phone from behind the counter and dialed 911, her voice steady as she explained. Minutes later, sirens wailed, and police cars flooded the lot, their lights flashing red and blue. I stayed inside, wrapped in a blanket Doris gave me, watching as officers searched the area.They found Tom’s truck abandoned a mile down the highway. My phone was inside, along with the black bag—containing a hunting knife, zip ties, duct tape, and a roll of plastic sheeting. The police told me Tom had a record: multiple arrests for stalking and assault, using Tinder to target women at truck stops where he thought no one would notice. Some women hadn’t made it out like I did.I haven’t opened Tinder since. I can still hear the thud of that truck door, smell that chemical scent, see the glint of that knife. Now, I meet people in busy places—coffee shops, malls, never anywhere remote. I tell my friends exactly where I’m going, and I listen to that gut feeling when it tells me to run. It saved my life that night.

  


# ""Rest Easy"":

I never thought a Tinder date could turn into a nightmare, but sitting in my car at this truck stop, my heart’s pounding like it’s trying to escape my chest. His name on the app was Jake, and he seemed perfect—witty messages, a warm smile in his photos, and a job as a trucker that gave him this rugged, adventurous vibe. We’d been texting for a week, and when he suggested meeting at this truck stop, halfway between our towns, I thought it was bold, maybe even romantic. A story to laugh about later with friends over coffee. But now, parked here in the dark, I’m starting to question everything.The truck stop is unsettling, like it’s stuck in a forgotten corner of the world. The neon sign above the diner blinks “Rest Easy,” but half the letters are out, and it buzzes like an angry insect. The parking lot stretches wide, dotted with a handful of massive trucks, their engines rumbling low, like a warning. The gas pumps are lit by flickering fluorescent lights that cast long, twitching shadows across the cracked pavement. Beyond the lot, there’s nothing but darkness, the highway’s hum faint and far away. It feels like the edge of nowhere, and I’m alone in it.I check my phone again—9:25, and Jake was supposed to be here at 9. My fingers hover over the screen, debating whether to text him or just drive away. My stomach churns with nerves, a mix of embarrassment for being stood up and a growing unease about this place. The diner’s windows glow faintly, but the light doesn’t feel welcoming. Maybe I should go inside, wait there instead of sitting in my car like a target. But before I can decide, I see movement near one of the trucks—a tall figure stepping out from the shadows.It’s a man, walking toward me with a slow, deliberate stride. My heart skips as I squint through the windshield. He’s not what I expected. The Jake in the photos was clean-shaven, maybe 30, with bright eyes and a confident grin. This man looks older, closer to 45, with a scruffy beard and a faded trucker hat pulled low over his eyes. His plaid shirt is worn, sleeves rolled up to reveal a long, jagged scar across his forearm. He waves, calling my name in a voice that’s rougher than the smooth texts I’d read.“Hey, sorry I’m late,” he says as he reaches my car. “Got caught up with a delivery.”I force a smile, my hand lingering on the door handle. “No worries,” I say, stepping out. My voice sounds too high, too shaky. I tell myself it’s just nerves, that maybe he’s just not photogenic. But something feels off, like the air itself is heavier around him.“Let’s head inside,” he says, nodding toward the diner. “Get some food, talk a bit.”I nod, clutching my purse as we cross the lot. The gravel crunches under my shoes, and I notice how quiet it is—no birds, no chatter, just the low drone of the trucks. Inside, the diner smells like burnt grease and stale coffee. The linoleum floor sticks to my soles, and the booths are old, with cracked red vinyl seats that squeak when we sit down. A couple of truckers are at the counter, one hunched over a plate of eggs, the other scrolling on his phone. They don’t look up. The waitress, a woman with tired eyes and a messy bun, hands us menus that are sticky to the touch.“So, how long you been a trucker?” I ask, trying to fill the silence as we wait for our drinks—coffee for him, a soda for me.“About 15 years,” he says, but his eyes keep flicking to the door, like he’s expecting someone. “Long hauls, mostly. Keeps me moving.”I nod, but his answers feel rehearsed, like he’s reading from a script. He’s nothing like the guy who sent me funny memes and long stories about life on the road. This Jake is tense, his fingers tapping the table, his coffee mug trembling slightly in his hands. I notice his nails are dirty, bitten down to the quick. The scar on his arm seems to catch the light, almost like it’s alive.“You okay?” I ask, my voice barely steady. “You seem… distracted.”“Just tired,” he says quickly, his smile tight. “Long day. You know how it is.”I don’t, but I nod anyway, sipping my soda to hide my unease. The waitress brings our food—a burger for me, fries and coffee for him. He barely touches his plate, just picks at a fry, his eyes darting around the diner. I try to keep the conversation going, asking about his favorite places to drive, but his stories are all over the place. He says he was in Texas yesterday, then mentions a job in Ohio the same day, like he forgot his own lie. When I point it out, his laugh is sharp, almost angry.“Got my wires crossed,” he says, his eyes narrowing. “You’re real curious, aren’t you?”My heart skips. “Just making conversation,” I say, my voice smaller than I want it to be. I glance at the clock above the counter—10:05. I’ve been here too long.He leans forward, his voice low. “You know, this place has a reputation. Truckers talk about it. People come here, and sometimes… they don’t leave.”I freeze, my fork halfway to my mouth. “What do you mean?” I ask, trying to sound casual, but my pulse is racing.He smirks, his eyes glinting in a way that makes my skin crawl. “Just stories. Missing people, weird stuff at night. You hear things on the road.”“That’s not funny,” I say, pushing my plate away. My appetite’s gone.“Who said I was joking?” he says, his smirk fading into something darker.I feel a chill, like the air in the diner just dropped ten degrees. “I think I should go,” I say, reaching for my purse.“Let’s take a walk first,” he says, standing up before I can argue. “Clear our heads.”I hesitate, my instincts screaming to stay put, but he’s already heading for the door. I don’t want to seem scared, so I follow, cursing myself for not trusting my gut. Outside, the parking lot feels even darker, the shadows between the trucks thicker, like they’re hiding something. The air smells of diesel and something metallic I can’t place. Jake walks ahead, his steps quick, leading me toward the far end of the lot where the trucks are parked in a tight row.“You ever seen inside a rig?” he asks, glancing back at me. “Mine’s right over there. Pretty cool setup.”“No, I’m good,” I say, slowing down. My keys are in my hand now, the sharp end pressed against my palm. “I really need to get home.”“Come on,” he says, his voice sharper now. “Just a quick look. You’ll like it.”My heart’s pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears. “I said no,” I say, stepping back toward the diner.He turns, his face half-lit by the flickering pump lights. “Don’t be like that,” he says, closing the distance between us. “We’re having a good time, right?”“I’m leaving,” I say, turning toward my car. But before I can take another step, his hand clamps onto my wrist, his grip like iron.“You’re not going anywhere,” he says, his voice low and cold, his eyes locked on mine.I try to pull away, panic flooding my chest. “Let go!” I shout, my voice echoing in the empty lot.He tightens his grip, pulling me closer. “Stop making a scene,” he hisses. “Just come with me.”“Hey!” a voice cuts through the darkness. I whip my head around to see a man—an older trucker with a gray beard and a heavy jacket—standing near one of the pumps. He’s holding a flashlight, its beam slicing through the shadows, pointed right at us. “What’s going on here?”“He’s not letting me go,” I say, my voice trembling so much I barely recognize it.Jake’s grip loosens, but he doesn’t let go completely. “We’re just talking,” he says, his tone flat, like he’s daring the trucker to argue.The trucker steps closer, his flashlight steady. “Let her go. Right now,” he says, his voice calm but firm, like he’s not afraid of Jake.Jake glares at him, then at me, his jaw tight. Finally, he releases my wrist, muttering something under his breath. “You’ll regret this,” he says softly, just for me, before turning and disappearing into the shadows between the trucks.I’m shaking so hard I can barely stand. The trucker walks me back to my car, his flashlight lighting the way. “You okay?” he asks, his voice kinder now.“I think so,” I say, my throat tight. “Thank you. I don’t know what he was going to do.”“I’ve seen him around,” the trucker says, frowning. “He hangs out here a lot, always talking to girls. Heard rumors about him—shady stuff. You’re lucky I was out here checking my rig.”I nod, tears stinging my eyes as I reach my car. I fumble with my keys, but when I turn the ignition, nothing happens. The engine clicks, dead. My heart sinks. “No, no, no,” I mutter, trying again.“Car trouble?” the trucker asks, peering through my window.“Battery’s dead,” I say, my voice cracking. I glance around, half-expecting Jake to step out from the shadows.“I can give you a jump,” the trucker says. “Got cables in my rig. Stay here, lock your doors.”I nod, locking myself in as he walks to his truck. Every sound makes me jump—the creak of a trailer, the hum of an engine, a distant door slamming. I keep my eyes on the shadows, waiting for Jake to reappear. My phone’s at 10%, and I’m too scared to call anyone, worried it’ll die before I’m safe.The trucker returns with cables and pops my hood. As he works, he talks to keep me calm. “This place gets weird at night,” he says. “Lots of stories—girls going missing, guys like him causing trouble. Stick to coffee shops for dates, kid.”“I will,” I say, my voice barely a whisper. I’m kicking myself for ever thinking this was a good idea.Finally, my car roars to life. I thank him over and over, my hands still shaking as I grip the wheel. “Get out of here,” he says, stepping back. “And don’t stop till you’re home.”I pull onto the highway, the truck stop shrinking in my rearview mirror. My heart’s still racing, my mind replaying Jake’s cold eyes, his whispered threat. I don’t know what he wanted, but I know I got lucky. That night, I lie awake, staring at the ceiling, wondering how close I came to not making it home. I delete Tinder at dawn, my hands still trembling. No more truck stops. No more Jakes.

I've got my spot in this local coffee shop – right by the window, perfect for people-watching and zoning out with my latte. Caught myself feeling oddly territorial when I saw someone else there today... I guess that spot really grew on me. 

Turns out, this is a thing called 'territoriality.' It's that typical human tendency to claim certain spaces as 'ours,' even when we don't officially own them. I read somewhere (or maybe I heard it?) that our sense of comfort and familiarity kinda tricks our brain into thinking we've got some right to that space. Weirdly enough, it probably boils down to ancient instincts, like marking territory to feel secure.

Seats  &  Comfort
As mentioned previously, the seats are incredibly uncomfortable. I did find a semi fix by putting 14x20""  foam in a pillow case to avoid the concave seats. However, still very uncomfortable.  Back passenger found seats too firm. The lack of storage space in general is disappointing l for a midsize SUV. The glove box cant fit much more than the manuals, the center console has a small tissue box (max), and the sun glasses  compartment barely fits regular sunglasses.  In fact, the sun glasses compartment is the rattling issue I couldn't find on previous reviews. Plastic on plastic in a tight fit rattles. Vehicle needs a sub badly. Virtually no lows on noisy pavement.  The ride is fantastic...on smooth pavement. On poor pabemt, you feel every bump. The temperature settings for a/c seem far off from other vehicles I have owned.  Typically run 69-71 and cabin with hot sun on window is fine. But this froze at times even at 71. 
2 times I had a 10 second warning I should consider pulling of that were so quick I couldn't read all the text.  Not sure if based on lane mgt or just random. Seemed strange.

Engine related
Noticed 2 things driving that I had not noticed on short city: 1. A vibration for upwards of 2 min when attempting to accelerate on inclines. Similar feeling/ sound like driving on an unbalanced tire.  Happened 3-4 times. 2.  Sound like a percolating coffee pot right side when accelerating.  This one I believe dealer warned was common complaint. Will verify both when I return. 

Other
After less than 6 months, key fob is already a problem. Have to hold within 3 inches of start button to get recognized. 
This started during trip of course.  

110v combined with leaving in EV mode was great for quick dinner stops while keeping electric cooler on.  However, to accomplish this I have to manually lock doors and use actual key to unlock as key fob doesn't work when using manual lock.

Thursday physical therapy comes, they check me over, take my vitals and say I'm doing fine. 

Note that Thursday morning as I got up to make coffee I passed out cold in the kitchen. Luckily sat down at table and called for Daughter and everything was OK-but I was definitely out cold for 60 seconds or so.  Woke up very confused and disoriented. 

Friday I start looking at my bandage. There appears to be fresh blood seeping out from under it, not a lot -but still. Also my knee cap area looks darn near black. I am not scheduled to be seen by another medical professional until Monday when PT comes back. 

I reread the 10 pages of instructions I was given postop and there are a few things that I find either confusing or contradictory, including a few paragraphs that address ""the injection site"" (what??).   I am home alone at this time as my daughter has gone to run a few errands. Suddenly I start questioning-why is it that-

#I am the individual charged with evaluating my current state of health?

I am not a medical person. The point person at the surgeon's office is a ""personal trainer"". I also am uncertain of the medical role of the physical therapist. 

Long story short, I feel like if I were the mother of the surgeon he would be having eyes on my incision.  

So I called the surgeon's office and indicate that I am uncertain how to evaluate my incision. The person who answers the phone tells me it's ""probably OK "".   

IDGAF what the person who answers the phone thinks is ""probably OK"". So basically I complain a lot more that I am uncertain and she finally offers me the option to upload some pictures to the portal and the surgeon will call me. And that's what happened. But I had to push a lot for that to happen (and it occurs to me that some people my age would not be technically savvy enough to upload photos to a portal). 
 
I'm curious as to what others think about this. The fact that it was Friday and I would presumably not have access to any medical staff for another 72 hours definitely played into my feeling of needing some reassurance that things were progressing OK.  I just did not feel properly attended to in this situation. 

TL:DR. I felt uncomfortable being the person evaluating the state of my incision site/surgery progress just 48 hours after surgery without medical oversight at that critical time",1,1749989167.0,Kneereplacement,0,1.0,False

CARNAGE CREW EPISODE 1: BEAR MINIMUM

\---

\[The screen fades from black to a road in a snowy spruce forest with mountains ahead. Suddenly a wrecked truck screeches on the road almost falling over. It gets its balance back and continues driving on the left lane.\]



\[Snow pelts the windshield. The engine sputters. Inside the cramped, beat-up vehicle are all eight mercs—and Bingo Boy, wagging his tail.\]



The ranger: (sipping coffee) We're almost there. Radar says the crash site’s just past Dead Moose Pass.



Bandit: ""Dead Moose Pass""? You’re makin' this up. That’s not real.\[suddenly the hunter leans over and starts talking over bandit\]  
  


Hunter: (grinning) It’s real. I’ve been here. Shot my first elk near here.  
  


\[The gunslingers face becomes a little more pale\]  
  


Gunslinger: Don’t like the sound of that. Sounds like a place full'a ghost deer. Me and Lucy can’t handle scares that well.



Bandit: What was the job anyway?Accelerator: We had to find an important briefcase in a crashed plane somewhere near the mountains.



Accelerator: (scrolling on her wrist device) The briefcase should still be intact. Assuming the oversized bears haven’t eaten it yet.



\[The brawler looks at the accelerator for a second\]  
  


Brawler: (grunts) 



Bandit: Have you ever said anything besides 'grunt'? Serious question.

\[Pyromancer sees a deer outside walking along the road\]  
  


Pyromancer: (muffled through gas mask) Mmmfphh! (giggles, flicks lighter)



Assassin: (calm, monotone) We are being watched.  
  


\[Ranger looks over still sipping his coffee\]  
  


Ranger: You say that like it's not a weekly thing.



\[The camera cuts to a shot of the road where the truck is speeding.\]\[The camera zooms out showing the large mountains while the truck keep becoming smaller and smaller as the screen zooms out\]

\[the truck pulls up to an old gas station. Flickering neon. Snowbanks everywhere. The dog jumps out first and pees immediately.\]

\[the crew step out of the car, looking at the station\]  
  


Gunslinger: Well I’ll be—this place looks like a haunted waffle house.



Bandit: You think they got snacks? I’m not fightin' bears on an empty stomach.



\[They file into a dusty, cramped convenience store. Shelves of expired goods. A mounted moose head wearing sunglasses. A middle aged man sits  behind the counter—his name tag says ""DALE.""\]



Dale: Y’all out for huntin’ or dyin’? Either way, you’ll find both in these hills.



Ranger: We’re, uh, just passin’ through.



Dale: Ain’t nobody just passin’ through Dead Moose Pass.



\[Accelerator looks over to bandit, while Dale speaks in the background\]  
  


Accelerator: (to Bandit) You hear that? He just confirmed it's real.



Bandit: Still not convinced.



Dale: If you guys are goin’ out there you gotta watch out for Bigfoot.

\[Bandit instantly turns around with a smug smile\]Bandit: So you believe in little monster stories? I knew you were crazy but didn’t know it was this bad. (still keeping the smug smile)  
  


Hunter: (casually) He’s real.



Bandit: Oh you too? would you believe if i said our vacuum cleaner is possessed too?



Dale: (leans over counter) I seen him myself. Twelve feet tall. Eyes like glowin’ coals. Screamed like a train crash.

\[Pyromancer is sitting on the floor, deeply immersed in the story.\]  
  


Pyromancer (nods, fascinated) Mmmhmm!



Assassin: There is no proof.



Bandit: Only thing bigger than that guy’s hair is his imagination.



\[Brawler looks up from the shelf while eating beef jerky and giving it to Bingo Boy.\]



Dale: He took Jimmy’s leg off. Clean bite.



Bandit: Yeah? Where’s Jimmy?



Dale: Go search him in the cave he got lost in and find out.



\[The crew all slowly steps back.\]  
  


\[Accelerator breaks the silence\]  
  


Accelerator: I just came for batteries.



\[Cut to them checking out with snacks: chips, jerky, firecrackers, bug spray, and a random cowboy hat Bandit forces on Pyromancer.\]



Dale: Y’all come back alive now. Bring Bigfoot’s teeth. I’ll give ya a soda.



Pyromancer: (muffled giggling) Mmmph!

  


\[The screen cuts to gunslinger outside walking around with lucy in hand pretending to shoot the trees\]



Gunslinger: Pew Pew!  
  


\[He wander deeper into the woods\]  
  


Gunslinger (wandering) Just stretchin’ the legs. Nothin’ wrong with that.



\[He hears a deep snort. A GIANT BEAR sniffs from the trees. He freezes.\]



Gunslinger: Uh… Easy there pal?  
  


\[He runs. Trips. Falls down into a snowy slope, landing in a river losing lucy.\]  
  


Gunslinger: LUCYYYYYYY—!



\[He’s pulled downstream, screaming.\]

  


\---

\[The screen cuts to the team climbing the mountain\]



\[The team hikes to the plane. Claw marks on metal. Strange footprints in snow.\]



Ranger: Still say Bigfoot isn't real?



Bandit: Yes. Because I am sane, unlike Bale or what was his name.



Hunter: Something dragged the pilot out. Look at the trail.



Accelerator: Briefcase is up there in the cockpit. I can scan the lock remotely.\[Suddenly pyromancer is pointing towards the bushes\]Pyromancer: Mmmphmp!  
  


\[Bears emerge from trees. Massive. Growling.\]



Bandit: Oh



Ranger: Defensive circle! Brawler, left flank!



\[Brawler gets his gun and starts firing at the bears\]



Brawler: Grrrraaaagh!



Pyromancer: (laughs like a maniac) MMMMPH!  
  


\[Ranger and hunter get their weapons and start shooting at one of the bears.\]\[Bandit slides between the bear's legs, shooting it from below and almost gets stomped on while the accelerator is firing her laser at one of the bears.\]\[Pyromancer, brawler and the accelerator get all swept away by one of the bears.\]Bandit: holy i knew these fellas were big but i didn’t expect them to be so massive!  
  


\[The team fights back. Bear claws slash at snow. Bullets fly.\]\[Assassin fires a bullet into one of the bear's eyes. blinding it partially\]\[The bear tries to scratch Bandit but he ducks and dodges the attack\]



\[Ranger fires a bullet straight into one of the bears heads killing it\]Ranger: One down!



\[Assassin shoots a poison dart into the bear's other eye, this time blinding it completely.\]



\[The bear starts to waddle closer to the cliff. Brawler takes this opportunity and lunges forward into the bear knocking it off the cliff.\]

Brawler: Grahhhh!



Brawler: Only one left!



\[The bear growls and lunges towards the crew\]



\---

The camera cuts to a river, with gunslinger passed out in the water.\]



\[He washes up on a snowy riverbank, coughing.\]



Gunslinger: I am officially done with rivers.Gunslinger: We gotta find the mates and complete the mission right Lucy?



\[He walks for a bit and sees HUGE FOOTPRINTS.\]



Gunslinger ...Dale might’ve been onto somethin’.



(Branches snap. BIGFOOT roars behind him.)



Gunslinger: OH SWEET LUCY—!



\[The camera cuts to a normal looking bush with trees around it until gunslinger sprints through it being chased by the beast\]Gunslinger: HEY EASY THERE PAL MAYBE WE CAN WORK SOMETHIN’ OUT\[He climbs up a hill and sees an old bridge over a large ravine\]\[He sees the beast right behind climbing the hill. He shoots the creature in the face, covering its fur with blood. The beast stops for a moment and then starts climbing the hill again even faster.\]Gunslinger: Oh god Lucy we gotta go!  
  


\[He starts running to the other side along the bridge\]Bigfoot: (Roars)\[Gunslinger manages to get to the other side of the bridge as it falls to the ravine\]\[Bigfoot roars one last time before wandering to the woods\]Gunslinger: Yeah you better run because me and Lucy are comin’ for you!\[The camera cuts to the rest of the crew fighting the last bear\]\[The last bear is swiping at the crew. Snow sprays. Teeth bared. The team is scattered but holding their ground.\]

[Diagnose it in under 90 seconds—free tool here!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

### The Lure of Thailand: Why Go Nomadic Here?

Thailand. The word alone sizzles with promise. Sun-bleached beaches, electric cities, and a cost of living that whispers, “Why not?” Culture here isn’t just a backdrop—it’s a full-sensory feast. The food, the festivals, the frenetic energy. Add in a climate that’s basically an endless summer, and you’ve got a siren song for anyone with a laptop and a dream.

But let’s torch the Instagram filter. Is it all coconut shakes and hammock selfies? Or is the digital nomad mythos just another mirage? Paradise, yes. But paradise with paperwork, power outages, and the occasional existential crisis.

***🌏 Want to know your earning power as a nomad? [Discover it instantly—click here!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

### The Visa Labyrinth: Navigating Entry

The first boss battle: visas. Thailand’s got more entry options than a Bangkok night market’s got pad thai stalls. The tourist visa is the default—easy, but temporary. You’ll get 30 to 60 days, maybe a bit more with extensions. But for the digital nomad, there are juicier options: the Smart Visa, the Long-Term Resident (LTR) visa, and the ever-popular education visa hustle.

Each comes with its own maze of requirements. Proof of income, health insurance, background checks. Miss a step and it’s back to square one—or worse, the dreaded visa run.

### Setting Up Shop: Where to Land First

Bangkok. The city that never sleeps, sweats, or slows down. Skyscrapers, street food, and Wi-Fi that mostly works. Perfect for the urban animal.

Chiang Mai. The unofficial nomad capital. Laid-back, affordable, and crawling with coworking spaces. The air’s cleaner, the pace is slower, and the coffee scene is lethal.

Phuket and the islands. If you crave the sound of waves as your background track, this is your jam. Just make sure your internet isn’t as spotty as your tan.

***💡 Curious about your digital nomad income ceiling? [Find out in 90 seconds—free tool here!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

### Cost of Living: Truth vs. Instagram

Forget the influencer fantasy. Rent in Chiang Mai can be shockingly low—think $200 for a studio, $500 for a swanky condo. Bangkok? Double it, but you get a skyline view.

Food? Street eats for a buck. Western food will mug your wallet. Hidden fees lurk everywhere: laundry, transport, random “foreigner taxes.” Budget like a cynic, spend like a local.

### Internet: The Lifeblood

Wi-Fi is the oxygen of nomad life. In cities, it’s fast and cheap. Most cafes and coworking spaces are fiber-fueled. On the islands, it’s a gamble. Always have a local SIM card with a fat data plan. Backup plans save careers.

### Finding Your Tribe: The Nomad Community

You’re not alone. Coworking spaces are everywhere—think WeWork, but with more flip-flops and less corporate jargon. Meetups pop up weekly. Masterminds, startup weekends, and spontaneous rooftop gatherings. Find your people or build your own crew.

### Work-Life Alchemy: Productivity in Paradise

Time zones. They’ll mess with your head and your sleep. Sync with clients in New York, Zoom with partners in Berlin, all while sipping coconut water at noon. The hammock trap is real—too much paradise, not enough productivity. Set boundaries or get swallowed by the blur.

### Accommodation: From Hostels to High-Rises

Short-term? Hostels, Airbnbs, and guesthouses abound. Long-term? Hunt for condos or apartments—Facebook groups and local agents are your best bet. Watch for scams. Always see the place before you pay.

### Getting Around: Planes, Trains, and Tuk-Tuks

Bangkok’s BTS and MRT are fast and cheap. Tuk-tuks are fun once, then just expensive. For intercity travel, buses and trains are dirt cheap, but slow. Domestic flights connect the dots for a few bucks.

### Money Moves: Banking and Payments

Cash is king, but cards are catching up. Opening a Thai bank account is possible, but not always easy. Digital wallets like GrabPay and TrueMoney are everywhere. Keep a stash of emergency cash—ATMs sometimes eat cards for breakfast.

***🚀 Ready to uncover your digital nomad income potential? [Diagnose it in under 90 seconds—free tool here!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

### Health & Safety: Staying Sane and Secure

Health insurance isn’t optional. Accidents happen, and hospitals expect cash. Choose a plan that covers both tropical bugs and scooter mishaps. Safety? Thailand’s generally chill, but petty theft and scams lurk in tourist hotspots.

### Food: Street Eats and Survival

Pad thai, som tam, khao soi. Eat local, eat cheap, eat happy. Western food is everywhere, but you’ll pay for the privilege. If you’ve got dietary quirks, learn the lingo or risk culinary roulette.

### Legal Landmines: Taxes and Compliance

Digital nomads skate a legal gray zone. Technically, working on a tourist visa is a no-no. Tax residency is a minefield—know your obligations back home and in Thailand. Don’t play fast and loose with the law; the consequences are real.

***🌏 Want to know your earning power as a nomad? [Discover it instantly—click here!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

### Language: Getting By and Getting Ahead

A few Thai phrases open doors. Locals appreciate the effort, even if your tones are tragic. Language apps help, but nothing beats immersion. Smile, wai, and try not to butcher the basics.

### The Dark Side: Scams, Burnout, and Loneliness

Not all that glitters is gold. Scams target the unwary—double-check everything. Burnout creeps in when work and play blur. Loneliness? It hits hard, especially after the novelty fades. Build resilience, reach out, and don’t isolate.

### Scaling Up: Building Your Nomad Empire

Network like your future depends on it—because it does. Clients, gigs, collaborations—they all start with a conversation. Explore passive income: courses, affiliate marketing, remote consulting. Build assets, not just invoices.

***💡 Curious about your digital nomad income ceiling? [Find out in 90 seconds—free tool here!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)***

### Giving Back: Ethical Nomadism

Don’t just take—give. Support local businesses, respect customs, and tread lightly. Volunteer, donate, or simply be a good guest. Your footprint matters.

### Exiting Gracefully: Visa Runs and Next Steps

Visa runs are a rite of passage. Laos, Malaysia, Cambodia—pick your poison. But plan ahead. Overstaying is costly and messy. When it’s time to move on, leave no loose ends.

### The Future of Nomadism in Thailand

Change is the only constant. Laws shift, hotspots rise and fall, the scene evolves. Stay agile, stay informed, and adapt. The golden age of nomadism is now—but it won’t last forever.

Urvashi n rajeev's fight regarding that egg was so petty, n why do urvashi behave like a bully....she is always irritated about something...

At this point, aashka looks like her chamchi n nothing else. She may b*tch about urvashi behind her back with delnaaz but infront of her she stays mum.

Delnaaz was such a cutie in the earlier episodes,she is a cutie now also but her behaviour with rajeev always leaves me confused.... Does she wants to have a relation with him or not? 

Rajeev, bhai iss bande mai tou koi self respect hee nahi lagti.... Why does he tries to be so cosy with the girls. Even when some of them give him clear signals that they are not interested still he doesn't gets it... Niketan is okay, okay i don't have much to say about him but yeah that one stand he took against siddu was brilliant.The way he articulated his words was so good.

Sapna waah yeh behan tou spitfire hai.. so bold n she knows when to take a stand for herself n when to be a mediator for others. Brajesh would always make it feel like he was caught between two stools...there were situation were he could have taken a straight stand yet he decided to stay neutral... In the coffee wala issue where Niketan had hidden or in his words tried joking about the coffee,it was clearly niketan's fault yet brajesh disntycalled him out also aashka's behti ganga at that time was so uncalled for....

I just hate siddu's holier than thou attitude.
Kashif i felt was a passive aggressive person n no matter have they tried to make him look like a bhola bhala person in his last episode with sallu i felt if he would have stayed his misogynist tendency would come out in the open like before...

I'm kind of curious about what, on a daily average, tends to off-center your mind the most. That one thing that always causes you to get sidetracked, backtracked, or just feel off-balanced for the rest of the day. Until you put in conscious mental effort to regain that mental center and concentration to finish what needs be done that day. What's your chosen cure to get back your composure, let me put it like that instead.

My personal case, mostly because I don't have fixed working hours - just a vast quantity of perpetual work to care for - it's when I break my established workflow, when I'm really in that sweet productive mental zone. Either because someone interrupts for a break - and breaks more often than not *break* my mental flow unless it's an alone-coffee. Or because I have to attend to something else after a couple of hours of active work. Say 4 hours of constant hustle.

It feels like it takes me about 2 hours more after that to get back into that same flow. It might be an issue of compartmentalizing different aspects of your life and switching, but might be something more than just that. I feel like an old pickup who needs to heat-up well before the ride starts feeling anywhere near ""smooth"".

My cure for it though. I like to think a vast a quantity of coffee and breathing exercises so as not to get a heart attack are what keeps me pushing till I break the ice, no matter how many times it takes to enter full productivity mode again.

I figured out this lil trick that kinda helps me. It's called chunking, usually used for memory, but turns out it's great for chatting too! When I meet someone new, I mentally 'chunk' things I'd like to say or ask into small groups, like tidbits about myself or questions I wanna ask about them.

So instead of stressing to remember everything or come up with something on the spot, I've got these 'chunks' ready. It's like having a mini-convo toolkit in my brain. For example, I might group a few topics together—stuff like my sneaky little coffee addiction, asking about their favorite shows, or mutual friends we might have.

1lbygjn,https://i.redd.it/pmqsu196x27f1.jpeg,Swiss Arabian Vanilla Toffee- Review! 🍬☕️,"My impression: 🍭 


I have had this for about 3-4 weeks now. So, let me break this one down for you:
Imagine you just had a coffee and immediately followed it up with the OG Alpenliebe (uk, the classic gold caramel one). That’s the exact vibe of this scent! Straight up creamy caramel toffee with a hint of coffee in the back. That coffee isn’t loud, it’s just there, like a memory of the Kopiko while the Alpenliebe takes over completely.

This one is: creamy, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla tonka toffee.
Period.
I don’t get anything more from this.

(Many people on Fragrantica mentioned a burnt quality in this, but to be honest, I didn't pick up on that!)

This is a gourmand lover’s dream. It smells like dessert more like YOU are the dessert. 🍮
BUT BUT, if you are not into smelling like a literal toffee, it might not be for you. Personally, I like a bit more complexity in my scents, some depth, some contrast. This is very linear so like, what you smell at the start is what you will get all the way through.

Sweet, warm, creamy. Feels like a cozy hug in scent form. Definitely edible vibes. Think warm golden candy melting on your skin.

Notes: 📝 

Top notes:
Toffee, Coffee.

Middle notes:
Vanilla, Walnut, Dates, Cardamom, Milk.

Base notes:
Brown Sugar, Madagascar Vanilla, Woody Notes, Tonka Bean, Benzoin, Vanilla Caviar.

(But honestly, I am not picking up on the spices, dates, or woods. This one wears like straight caramel vanilla milk toffee.)

So, If you love ultra sweet gourmands, this is for you.
If you want some contrast (like some spices, earth accords, some floral accords or even booziness), this might feel a bit too flat or linear.


Performance: 🕰️ 
Longevity is actually solid. Around 7 hours before it turns into a skin scent. And since it’s a toffee vanilla profile, it will probably get even better with maturation.
Projection is around 3 feet in the first few hours. Cozy, but not a beast mode scent.

Also, this is duping Lush Sticky Dates.I don’t own that one so can’t compare.
Season: ❄️🍂 

Fall / Winter for sure. Or chilly spring nights. Not summer friendly unless you really love sweet.

Zodiac Vibe: ♋♉♍ (This is only for fun, wear whatever you love!)

Cancer, Taurus, Virgo. They are the comfort seekers!

Aesthetic and Vibe Check: 🍯🍂

This is the scent for the girl who shows up in a soft oversized sweater, hair in a messy bun, with chunky socks and a mug of coffee. She’s got cookies in the oven and a cozy Spotify playlist. She’s not trying to be seductive, but somehow, that cozy, sweet warmth is kind of intoxicating.

Character aesthetic: 🎥 

Think Rory Gilmore (from Gilmore Girls). Coffee in hand, oversized knit sweater, cozy bookstore dates. This scent fits her perfectly (imo) warm, comforting, and a little nostalgic!! 

TL;DR:

* Coffee + Alpenliebe vibe.

* Straight up sweet caramel toffee vanilla.

* Very linear. What you smell is what you get.

* Great longevity, soft projection.

* For the true gourmand lovers.

* Cozy AF, but not for those wanting complexity or depth.

* Not my personal style, but solid for what it is.

[Security for Resources: A New Era in Foreign Policy and Critical Mineral Diplomacy - Modern Diplomacy](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2025/06/14/security-for-resources-a-new-era-in-foreign-policy-and-critical-mineral-diplomacy/)

In an age defined by the race for clean energy technologies, critical minerals have emerged as both a geopolitical asset and a bargaining chip. The recently signed ‘Ukraine-United States Mineral Resources Agreement’ is emblematic of a broader strategic realignment, one where military support and political alliances are increasingly tied to the access and control of mineral [wealth](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yg456mzn8o). In what many observers are calling a “security-for-resources” model, the United States is formalizing a new kind of foreign policy framework: offering military and economic backing in return for access to strategic natural resources.

At the heart of this deal lies a pragmatic calculus. Ukraine possesses vast but largely untapped reserves of critical minerals, including lithium, cobalt, titanium, graphite, and rare earth elements (REEs) like neodymium, yttrium, cerium, etc., which are essential for clean energy technologies, defense systems, and [electronic](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/1/what-is-in-the-us-ukraine-minerals-deal) [manufacturing](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20le8jn282o). In exchange for continued US military aid, Ukraine has agreed to co-create a bilateral reinvestment fund that will draw from 50% of future revenues generated through monetizing state-owned oil, natural gas, and mineral assets. Although Ukraine retains ownership of its resources, this new structure allows the United States a formal, long-term stake in the commercial benefits of Ukraine’s mineral [wealth](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-know-about-signed-us-ukraine-minerals-deal).

**Strategic Gains on Both Sides**

The motivation is clear. The US, which has been seeking to reduce its dependency on Chinese supply chains for critical minerals, views Ukraine as a viable long-term alternative. China currently dominates the global landscape, controlling over 60% of mining and 90% of processing capacity for [REEs](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1drqeev36qo). Diversifying sources is not only about economic resilience but also about securing national security in an era increasingly shaped by resource scarcity and technological competition.

For Ukraine, the stakes are existential. The war has devastated its infrastructure and undermined foreign investor confidence, and it has lost a significant portion of its resource-rich land under Russian occupation. According to Ukrainian estimates, the value of mineral reserves in these territories exceeds $350 [billion](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20le8jn282o). In such a context, linking mineral wealth to sustained Western support gives Ukraine not only an economic lifeline but also a strategic hedge. If American businesses and investment projects are embedded in Ukrainian territories, especially near the frontlines, it could potentially deter further Russian aggression. As some experts note, the presence of US investment interests could act as a form of *de facto* deterrence in contested regions.

Crucially, the structure of the agreement is significantly more favorable to Ukraine than earlier drafts. The final deal, pared down from a 90-page proposal to a concise 12-page framework, does not require Kyiv to repay past US military [aid](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/05/1/7510032/). Nor does it provide the US with preferential treatment over European investors, which aligns with Ukraine’s longstanding ambition to join the European Union. Moreover, Ukraine maintains full sovereignty over its resources while granting the US joint management rights over the reinvestment fund. The fund is structured to receive future and not current revenues, thus shielding Ukraine’s immediate fiscal flows while securing its longer-term reconstruction [goals](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/mapping-ukraines-rare-earth-and-critical-minerals).

**No Formal Security Guarantee: Yet Strategic Alignment**

Despite Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s push for a formal NATO-style security guarantee, the deal offers no such explicit assurance. Yet, it does signal a strong convergence between the US and Ukraine on national and economic security. The agreement institutionalizes American economic interests in Ukraine’s post-war recovery, aligning these with its political and military commitments. Moreover, future US military assistance is now linked not just to the defense of Ukraine’s sovereignty but also to safeguarding mutual economic ventures. This sets a precedent for future foreign policy configurations: state-building and defense partnerships increasingly embedded in the economics of reconstruction, minerals, and infrastructure. It is a realpolitik adaptation to a world in [flux](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/us-ukraine-strike-game-changing-minerals-deal-trump-pact-paves-for-175-bn-aid-to-kyiv/videoshow/120785964.cms?from=mdr).

**Security-for-Resources: A Broader Trend**

This transactional model is not unique to Ukraine. A similar structure is being explored in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where the United States is facilitating a peace arrangement between the DRC and Rwanda. The proposed deal, though not yet signed, would tie US-backed security guarantees and economic investment to access to cobalt, nickel, and lithium deposits, minerals vital to the global energy transition. In return, the deal aims to help end the ongoing conflict in eastern Congo, particularly in areas affected by Rwanda-backed M23 rebel [movements](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/congo-eyes-us-minerals-deal-by-end-june-ft-reports-2025-05-25/). The DRC-Rwanda draft agreement underscores the emerging pattern of “security-for-resources” diplomacy. It involves not just bilateral support but a recalibration of the logic of aid and investment. Governments are increasingly looking for strategic and economic returns on their commitments, particularly in fragile and resource-rich [states](https://www.ft.com/content/dbebe2e4-810c-4fec-b587-faf9533fa51b).

**Challenges Ahead: From Geology to Governance**

Still, these arrangements are not without hurdles. In Ukraine’s case, much of the geological data is outdated, relying on Soviet-era [mapping](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2025/2/ukraine-rare-earths-potential-relies-on-soviet-assessments-may-not-be-viable-87318842). New exploration and validation will require years of research and capital-intensive efforts. Developing a mine takes time, i.e., 18 years, on average, from discovery to production, and it operates for more than 50 [years](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-know-about-signed-us-ukraine-minerals-deal). The country’s mining infrastructure, like much of its economy, has been ravaged by war and will demand significant reconstruction before meaningful extraction can occur. Moreover, political risk looms large. The fact that some of Ukraine’s richest mineral fields lie in Russian-occupied zones complicates long-term planning and raises questions about the enforceability and profitability of such agreements. Peace, governance reform, and sustained institutional capacity will be critical to ensuring that such deals deliver on their promises.

**A New Kind of Partnership**

Despite the uncertainties, the US–Ukraine deal represents a turning point. It redefines the role of natural resources in post-conflict recovery and international alignment. Unlike traditional aid or investment deals, which often treat economic and security issues separately, this model recognizes their deep interdependence. By tying future revenue to present commitments, it locks both partners into a long-term strategic relationship. Importantly, it also reconfigures the role of developing or war-torn nations in global value chains. Rather than being passive recipients of aid or extractive exploitation, such nations can leverage their mineral wealth to secure military, economic, and diplomatic support. The key lies in ensuring transparency, fairness, and sustainability in how such partnerships are structured and monitored.

**Conclusion**

As the world transitions to a green economy, access to critical minerals is becoming a core element of geopolitical power. The US–Ukraine deal illustrates how foreign policy is evolving to meet this reality, creating a model that other countries may soon replicate. The countries must now prepare to engage in a world where strategic security and economic sovereignty are deeply intertwined. The age of “security-for-resources” has arrived, not just as a diplomatic tool, but as an architecture of the emerging international order.

Just as oil drove geopolitical tensions in the 20th century, rare earth elements could shape the rivalries of the 21st. These [17 metals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/rare-earth-element) – including the 15 lanthanides, plus scandium and yttrium – are essential to modern technologies, from smartphones and electric vehicles to wind turbines, radar systems, and fighter jets. They are the key enablers of the advanced technologies and military capabilities that underpin modern global power.

China accounts for approximately [60 percent](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/chinas-rare-earth-export-strategy-global-supply-2025/) of global rare earth raw material production, processes about [85 percent](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/chinas-rare-earth-export-strategy-global-supply-2025/) of the world’s output, and manufactures nearly [90 percent](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/chinas-rare-earth-export-strategy-global-supply-2025/) of the world’s rare earth magnets. It controls [nearly all](https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions) the refining capacity for heavy rare earth elements such as dysprosium and terbium, which are essential for high-performance magnets.

China dominates this sector not by chance, but thanks to a strategic effort spanning decades. Despite being a latecomer, China steadily overtook the United States. In the [1980s](https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/a-brief-history-of-us-china-rare-earth-rivalry/), the U.S. led rare earth production, primarily through the Mountain Pass mine in California. However, strict environmental regulations increased costs, leading to mine closures by the early [2000s](https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/a-brief-history-of-us-china-rare-earth-rivalry/). China [capitalized](https://rsis.edu.sg/rsis-publication/idss/ip24095-rare-earth-supremacy-chinas-ace-in-the-clean-technology-competition/) on this opportunity by leveraging its relatively lax environmental regulations and extensive state subsidies, reducing its production costs and eventually surpassed the U.S.

By 2025, Beijing is more openly leveraging its control over rare earths, using them both as a stick to pressure geostrategic rivals like the U.S. and as a carrot to incentivize cooperation with states such as Malaysia.

**China’s Geopolitical Playbook: Carrots and Sticks**

China uses a two-pronged strategy to influence power politics, combining rewards and pressure in what is often called a “carrot and stick” approach. It offers technology transfers and access to resources to countries with relatively stable ties to Beijing, while enforcing export controls and other restrictions on its geostrategic competitors. Using rare earths to advance its geostrategic interests has proven to be relatively effective for China.

China has started extending rare earth partnerships to countries that maintain a neutral stance or avoid siding with the West. In [April 2025](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2025/04/17/china-ready-to-share-rare-earth-processing-technology-with-malaysia), it proposed sharing rare earth separation technology with Malaysia, a nation with significant deposits but limited processing capabilities. Kuala Lumpur accepted the offer, seizing the opportunity to advance its industrial capacity while deepening economic ties with Beijing. In [June 2025](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3313533/china-signals-readiness-rare-earth-talks-approves-more-exports), Beijing stated its willingness to “enhance communication” on strategic minerals and emphasized that it has approved qualified export applications of rare earth in accordance with the law.

As tensions between the United States and China intensify, both sides are racing to secure and build resilient supply chains. In this context, Beijing is likely to increasingly utilize the carrot approach. The intended signal from Beijing is clear: steering clear of alignment with the West can bring tangible rewards – not only access to critical resources vital for national security, but also valuable technological cooperation to support industrial upgrading.

On the other hand, China has imposed rare earth export restrictions on its geopolitical rivals. These sanctions serve as sticks, enabling Beijing to exert pressure on countries that challenge its strategic objectives.

China’s use of rare earths as a geopolitical tool has a longer history. It first weaponized these resources in [2010](https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions), when it halted exports of rare earth to Japan for two months amid a territorial dispute. In [April 2025](https://www.idnfinancials.com/news/55036/china-still-freezes-rare-mineral-exports-how-is-america-responding#:~:text=Tensions%20escalated%20after%20Donald%20Trump%20announced%20a,dysprosium%2C%20lutetium%2C%20yttrium%2C%20and%20scandium%E2%80%94to%20the%20US.), amid the tariff war with the U.S., Beijing introduced new export controls on seven key rare earths and associated magnets, which are essential for defense technology, renewable energy, and automotive sectors. 

The global repercussions of China’s rare earth export restrictions have begun to surface. By [June 2025](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/some-european-auto-supplier-plants-shut-down-after-chinas-rare-earth-curbs-2025-06-04/), the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA) reported that several production lines were halted after exhausting their supplies. Additionally, Japan’s Suzuki Motor suspended production of its flagship Swift subcompact [due to](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/suzuki-motor-halted-swift-car-production-due-chinas-rare-earth-curb-nikkei-says-2025-06-05/) China’s rare earth export restrictions.

The U.S. is also feeling the pain of rare earth restrictions. A report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies warns that these constraints will cause [disruption](https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions) to U.S. companies. In [June](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/06/trump-xi-call-isnt-enough-to-resolve-critical-mineral-shortage.html) 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump initiated talks with China’s President Xi Jinping, with rare earths reportedly a key focus. However, a potential relief from China is likely to be undermined by U.S. restrictions on sensitive technologies and industries such as [semiconductors](https://www.thinkchina.sg/politics/behind-call-chinas-rare-earth-strategy-comes-focus). 

According to the Trump administration, China had committed to lifting the rare earths restrictions after talks in May, only to slow-walk implementation. It’s unclear if the latest agreement [reached in London](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-strikes-deal-restore-rare-earths-access) will fare any differently.

**The Global Counterplay Still Falls Short**

The international community has responded with growing concern over China’s use of the “stick” approach in rare earth policy, but efforts to push back remain fragmented and face significant challenges.

The United States has resumed operations at Mountain Pass, which is the [only](https://www.mining.com/us-greenlights-rare-earth-mine-next-to-mountain-pass-in-california/) operating rare earth mine in the U.S. now. A new magnet manufacturing facility in Texas, supported by General Motors, is expected to begin production by [late 2025](https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/gm-drives-america-how-were-creating-jobs-by-investing-in-manufacturing/#:~:text=Our%20partner%20MP%20Materials%20has%20completed%20construction,production%20expected%20to%20start%20in%20late%202025.&text=Going%20into%202025%20and%20beyond%2C%20GM%20will,secure%2C%20sustainable%2C%20scalable%2C%20and%20cost%2Dcompetitive%20supply%20chains.). Additionally, the U.S. passed the [Critical Minerals Security Act of 2025](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/789/text), requiring reports on critical mineral and rare earth elements resources globally to secure the U.S. rare earth supply chain.

Australia’s Lynas Rare Earths became the [first](https://www.mining.com/lynas-becomes-first-producer-of-heavy-rare-earths-outside-china/) producer of heavy rare earth outside China. It has commissioned additional processing capacity at a plant in Malaysia to produce up to [1,500](https://www.khq.com/national/rare-earth-production-outside-china-major-milestone/article_89f2d1fa-1302-5b16-a0db-1f093d910e3a.html) tonnes of heavy rare earths. 

However, a major obstacle for the U.S. and the West in replacing China lies in the high environmental costs. Producing one ton of rare earth [generates](https://hir.harvard.edu/not-so-green-technology-the-complicated-legacy-of-rare-earth-mining/) approximately 13 kg of dust, 9,600-12,000 cubic meters of waste gas, 75 cubic meters of wastewater, and one ton of radioactive residue. Furthermore, rare earth ores are often laced with radioactive thorium and uranium, posing [severe](https://hir.harvard.edu/not-so-green-technology-the-complicated-legacy-of-rare-earth-mining/) health risks to workers. Environmental movements and regulatory pressures in the U.S. and other Western countries may hinder rare earth mining projects, as they [have done](https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/a-brief-history-of-us-china-rare-earth-rivalry/) in the past.

Recycling presents a potential game-changer. By recovering rare earth elements from end-of-life products, countries can reintroduce them into the supply chain and reduce their dependence on China. For example, [Apple](https://www.apple.com/sg/newsroom/2025/04/apple-surpasses-60-percent-reduction-in-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions/) has surpassed 99 percent of its goal to use 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. The [European Union](https://www.euronews.com/green/2025/05/28/trash-is-cash-urban-mining-for-strategic-metals-in-your-neighbourhood) is also investing in urban mining and e-waste recovery to decrease reliance on mined supply.

However, less than [1 percent](https://thebulletin.org/2024/04/one-problem-for-renewables-not-enough-rare-earths-one-solution-recycling-but-theres-a-hitch/) of rare earths in electronic waste are recycled globally, due to the limited maturity of recycling technologies. Furthermore, the [high costs](https://thebulletin.org/2024/04/one-problem-for-renewables-not-enough-rare-earths-one-solution-recycling-but-theres-a-hitch/) and [logistical difficulties](https://thebulletin.org/2024/04/one-problem-for-renewables-not-enough-rare-earths-one-solution-recycling-but-theres-a-hitch/) involved in collecting rare earth-rich components from discarded electronics also pose major challenges.

To address supply chain vulnerabilities in essential minerals like rare earths, the United States launched the [Minerals Security Partnership (MSP)](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership) with key countries such as Australia, India, and Japan. Nevertheless, the MSP has reportedly attracted [minimal investment](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202409/1320311.shtml) and lacks sufficient [technological expertise](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership), raising questions about its effectiveness as a realistic alternative to China’s dominance in this field.

Additionally, a major barrier for these countries to replacing Chinese rare earth supplies is price. The Chinese government has long provided subsidies and promoted oversupply in the sector, making it difficult for alternative suppliers to compete due to reduced profitability. For instance, the price of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) dropped by [20 percent](https://english.ckgsb.edu.cn/knowledge/article/china-dominance-of-rare-earth-and-impact-on-global-market/) between January and July 2024. However, China’s rare earth industry can absorb such losses because the government is [willing](https://english.ckgsb.edu.cn/knowledge/article/china-dominance-of-rare-earth-and-impact-on-global-market/) to sacrifice short-term profits to retain strategic control over these critical materials. This low-profit environment further reinforces China’s dominance in the global rare earth market.

**Conclusion: The Future of Rare Earth Security**

Rare earths are likely to become an increasingly prominent tool for China to wield both as a stick and a carrot amid intensifying geopolitical tensions. As seen in the ongoing technology rivalry between China and the United States, the competition has expanded into resource-based conflicts, where control over upstream segments of the supply chain – such as in mining – provides significant strategic leverage.

China currently holds a dominant position in the rare earth industry, bolstered by state subsidies and relatively lenient environmental regulations. However, this dominance is not assured in the long term. By 2050, recycling and reuse are estimated to meet [30–40](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/circularity-reduce-dependence-china-rare-earths-study/704315/) percent of rare earth demand in the United States, China, and Europe. Although Beijing is expected to maintain a central role in rare earth supply chains in the near term, increasing efforts to enhance circularity of the rare earth supply chain may progressively diminish global dependence on China. Over time, this shift could erode China’s capacity to leverage these materials as instruments of geopolitical influence.

***China has a significant card to play in its trade negotiations with the US, which could not only put the Trump administration in a bind but also impact a wide range of consumer goods.***

https://preview.redd.it/mc9i7c2mq27f1.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=904069543b92df7f917eab74b24cc3ebffa6c766

Rare earth minerals, namely scandium, yttrium, and 15 types of lanthanides, usually sit unnoticed at the bottom of the periodic table. But experts in rare earths have told Business Insider that a shortage of these minerals — which mainly come from China — could induce a shortage in everything from aircraft parts to TV remotes.

“It’s not industry agnostic because [rare earths](https://www.businessinsider.com/rare-earths-tech-war-explainer-chips-ai-china-us-2024-11) are used in everything from TVs and laptops and phones to cancer treatments and MRI scanners to automotives to defense,” said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

“Especially as a bedrock to the [automotive industry](https://www.businessinsider.com/used-car-prices-vehicles-inventory-supply-dealers-tariffs-manufacturers-ford-2025-5), it is really critical because our automotive manufacturing industry was getting to a point where it had to halt operations and close manufacturing plants without access to these rare earths,” Baskaran added.

The importance of critical minerals came into focus when China [cut off its supply](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-rare-earth-restrictions-alarming-auto-industry-ford-bmw-tesla-2025-6) to the US after Trump imposed tariffs, as high as 245% for some goods, on the manufacturing hub in a trade war that escalated between February and May.

The two countries have since de-escalated tensions through trade talks after Trump agreed to lower duties on China to 30% for 90 days starting from May 14. After the latest [trade talks in London](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-and-china-reach-trade-framework-after-talks-in-london-2025-6) in mid-June, China has agreed to reopen export channels of its critical minerals to the US — at least for now.

“China built up its industry in a cheap and not necessarily ecologically refined manner, and the US said, ‘That’s very inexpensive, so we do not need to have this kind of industry in our country,'” Laura Lewis, professor of chemical engineering at the Northwestern University College of Engineering, saud. “And that was the case for many years.”

# Bilateral relations with China remain fragile

According to data from the 2024 US Geological Survey, 70% of critical mineral imports to the US came from China, followed by 13% from Malaysia. China also processes nearly 90% of the world’s rare earth minerals, according to the International Energy Agency.

Though the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, did not directly confirm how long rare earth licenses will remain issued to US manufacturers, a spokesperson told BI in a statement that “China has reviewed and approved a certain number of export license applications for rare-earth-related items.”

“Rare-earth-related items have dual-use attributes, with both military and civilian purposes, imposing export controls on such items is in line with international practices,” the spokesperson added.

Drew DeLong, lead in geopolitical dynamics practice at Kearney, a global strategy and management consulting firm, told BI that [manufacturers are going to stockpile](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-rare-earth-minerals-stockpile-mystery-opacity-worries-experts-2024-6) as much rare earth material as possible during the brief reprieve in US-China relations, in anticipation of more supply chain disruptions.

DeLong said that by August, when the [tariff suspension](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-china-trade-deal-agreement-slash-trump-tariffs-2025-5) expires, the US-China relation would reach a critical decision point where it “must either coalesce or collapse.”

“Markets now wait to see whether Beijing actually resumes outbound shipments, and whether Washington delivers on its part of the rollback, ” DeLong added. “There already appears to be hedging on trade tensions flaring up again.”

# America may need to work with what it has

The US once had a single operating rare earth mine in Mountain Pass, California, but it went bankrupt in 2015. [Molycorp](https://www.businessinsider.com/rare-earth-metals-not-for-the-faint-of-heart-2013-9#:~:text=MolyCorp%20(MCP)%20is%20the%20closest,costs%20and%20looser%20environmental%20restrictions.), its operator, filed for bankruptcy protection due to slumping rare earth prices and ballooning costs.

Meanwhile, China has spent decades building its capacity to process rare earths. Other countries, like Japan, have diversified where they get their rare earth metals to avoid relying on China.

Lewis, of Northwestern University, told BI that the US not only has a long way to go, but it may simply lack certain types of metals, even if it could extract others.

Lewis said that the US lacks a category of heavy rare earths necessary for magnets to endure hot environments like motors.

“We’re going to have to work with our allies and nature to get what we need,” said Lewis, “Because I cannot possibly imagine that the investment it would take to get our [rare minerals from asteroids](https://www.businessinsider.com/asteroid-mining-company-earth-startups-raw-materials-cobalt-gold-platinum-2021-3) is going to be less than what we can already achieve on earth through recycling and a thoughtful use of resources.”

“The philosophy in [Silicon Valley](https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-move-fast-and-break-things-sam-altman-openai-2023-12) is just throw enough time and money at it, and you’ll get it and fast, but nothing that we can do to get the rare earth industry healthy is going to happen fast,” Lewis added. “Nature’s smarter than we are.”

* ***Owner of the only American cobalt mine went bankrupt this year***

WASHINGTON, June 12 (Reuters) - ***U.S. President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill would make it harder for American critical minerals companies to compete with China because it eliminates a tax credit for boosting domestic production of nickel, rare earths and other materials used in advanced electronics and weaponry.*** With Trump and Republican lawmakers aiming to cut government support for green energy projects, the U.S. House of Representatives [passed a version of his ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act""](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-republicans-set-pre-dawn-votes-get-trump-tax-bill-over-finish-line-2025-05-22/) last month that eliminates the so-called 45X credit. The Senate is now debating the bill.

# GIVEN ~Key Provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill (H.R.1) Related to Foreign Ownership and Foreign Supply (FEOC)

[Senate Reviews Energy Tax Credit Limits in New Bill](https://natlawreview.com/article/key-provisions-one-big-beautiful-bill-hr1-related-foreign-ownership-and-foreign#google_vignette)

***The below summary describes provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill that were passed by the House and are currently under consideration in the Senate. The Senate may make changes to the legislation.*** 

* **Section 45X Limitations\[3\] (Manufacturing Production Tax Credits):**
   * No credit is allowed for taxable years **beginning after enactment** of the bill if the taxpayer is a Specified Foreign Entity.
   * No credit is allowed for tax years that begin after the date that is **two years after the date of enactment**

# Notes and Conclusion:

While all of the provisions in the bill related to energy tax credits are important, the prohibitions on tax credits provisions related to Material Assistance From a Prohibited Foreign Entity may overshadow the rest of the bill.

Given the broad definition of Prohibited Foreign Entity, any manufacturer with a Chinese parent *or intermediate company*

is likely a Prohibited Foreign Entity. The definitions of component, subcomponent, and critical mineral are broad and vague, and may include nearly all parts and materials in a project (not just cells or modules). 

The provisions related to Material Assistance From a Prohibited Foreign Entity (including the exceptions) are not entirely clear, however, and there is no available guidance for the interpretation of the exceptions. It is not unreasonable to interpret these provisions to render many projects ineligible for tax credits, although additional guidance would be necessary to determine whether that is actually the case. Further, as noted above, that at this stage the legislation has not been enacted into law, and it’s possible that it is never enacted or enacted in revised form.

# GIVEN PAST Shared responses to relevant questions June 24th, 2024

Good Morning Jim!

   Hopeful everything remains on Track! (Pun intended)  I have a few questions regarding the New 48C tax credit qualifications. & more......Please see attached for reference for context:

[Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit (48C) Program | Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/infrastructure/qualifying-advanced-energy-project-credit-48c-program)

[NioCorp Plans to Investigate Feasibility of Rare Earth Permanent Magnet Recycling | NioCorp Developments Ltd.](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-plans-to-investigate-feasibility-of-rare-earth-permanent-magnet-recycling/)

# Jim :

#  Niocorp is pursuing & qualifies for a portion of the 45X credits & is also looking into the possibility of REE magnet recycling. (**Noting that all/most of Nicorp's Scandium, Titanium, Niobium & Rare earths can most likely be recycled downstream in one form or another.)

# Jim- Could you please offer comment where possible on the following questions:

Given   

**""That potential downstream integration is being examined with regard to rare earths, as we are doing with scandium alloys. Our team has been involved in running commercial operations an across all five stages of the mine-to-magnet supply chain, including magnets.""**

# 1) Is it possible that the U.S. Govt. & other Entities share a continued interest in working with Niocorp towards a ""circular critical minerals economy"" utilizing all/many of Niocorp's Critcal Minerals pending finance.  

# RESPONSE:

# *********** ""YES. "" ****************

***& Can you offer comment as to how this might work?***

# Response:  

# **** ""What we are working on has many different components that are interrelated and not amenable to public disclosure at this point.  We will make announcements as material developments occur."" *****

1lbyfzs,https://i.redd.it/7b0zs7b0x27f1.jpeg,Swiss Arabian Vanilla Toffee- Review! 🍬☕️,"My impression: 🍭 


I have had this for about 3-4 weeks now. So, let me break this one down for you:
Imagine you just had a coffee and immediately followed it up with the OG Alpenliebe (uk, the classic gold caramel one). That’s the exact vibe of this scent! Straight up creamy caramel toffee with a hint of coffee in the back. That coffee isn’t loud, it’s just there, like a memory of the Kopiko while the Alpenliebe takes over completely.

This one is: creamy, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla tonka toffee.
Period.
I don’t get anything more from this.

(Many people on Fragrantica mentioned a burnt quality in this, but to be honest, I didn't pick up on that!)

This is a gourmand lover’s dream. It smells like dessert more like YOU are the dessert. 🍮
BUT BUT, if you are not into smelling like a literal toffee, it might not be for you. Personally, I like a bit more complexity in my scents, some depth, some contrast. This is very linear so like, what you smell at the start is what you will get all the way through.

Sweet, warm, creamy. Feels like a cozy hug in scent form. Definitely edible vibes. Think warm golden candy melting on your skin.

Notes: 📝 

Top notes:
Toffee, Coffee.

Middle notes:
Vanilla, Walnut, Dates, Cardamom, Milk.

Base notes:
Brown Sugar, Madagascar Vanilla, Woody Notes, Tonka Bean, Benzoin, Vanilla Caviar.

(But honestly, I am not picking up on the spices, dates, or woods. This one wears like straight caramel vanilla milk toffee.)

So, If you love ultra sweet gourmands, this is for you.
If you want some contrast (like some spices, earth accords, some floral accords or even booziness), this might feel a bit too flat or linear.


Performance: 🕰️ 
Longevity is actually solid. Around 7 hours before it turns into a skin scent. And since it’s a toffee vanilla profile, it will probably get even better with maturation.
Projection is around 3 feet in the first few hours.

Also, this is duping Lush Sticky Dates.I don’t own that one so can’t compare.
Season: ❄️🍂 

Fall / Winter for sure. Or chilly spring nights. Not summer friendly unless you really love sweet.

Zodiac Vibe: ♋♉♍ (This is only for fun, wear whatever you love!)

Cancer, Taurus, Virgo. They are the comfort seekers!

Aesthetic and Vibe Check: 🍯🍂

This is the scent for the girl who shows up in a soft oversized sweater, hair in a messy bun, with chunky socks and a mug of coffee. She’s got cookies in the oven and a cozy Spotify playlist. She’s not trying to be seductive, but somehow, that cozy, sweet warmth is kind of intoxicating.

Character aesthetic: 🎥 

Think Rory Gilmore (from Gilmore Girls). Coffee in hand, oversized knit sweater, cozy bookstore dates. This scent fits her perfectly (imo) warm, comforting, and a little nostalgic!! 

TL;DR:

* Coffee + Alpenliebe vibe.

* Straight up sweet caramel toffee vanilla.

* Very linear. What you smell is what you get.

* Great longevity, soft projection.

* For the true gourmand lovers.

* Cozy AF, but not for those wanting complexity or depth.

* Not my personal style, but solid for what it is.

Yesterday was wild. 

So here’s the story. I’ve been playing D2R on my Switch for about 4 months now. I played LoD on Battle.net for years, but this is my first time really diving into solo play. With only about an hour a day to spare, I never had the time to grind properly.

But this week was different—my fiancée was away on a trip, so I gave myself a mini staycation. Played 4–5 hours a day, leveled a Smiter, farmed keys, followed all the Uber guides, and got myself a decent budget setup. Spent the whole week getting ready.

And then… I failed.

Uber Mephisto absolutely ate me. Camped my corpse. I tilted so hard. We’re talking 8 hours of prep—farming keys, crafting rejuvs, making every run count. I rage-quit, went to bed fuming, told myself I was done with this game forever.

Fast forward to this morning: coffee in hand, picking my girl up from the airport in an hour, and I just thought, “F it. One more run.”

One Countess run.
One Summoner run.
One Lower Kurast run.

In 10 minutes, I get:

1 Lo rune (my first high rune in single player!)

1 Um rune

1 Vex rune


Just like that, I’m no longer tilted. I’m back. Diablo always pulls you back.

These are intended to draw attention to and coalesce resistance against inhumane, abusive, cashist, and tyrannical Dommes. 

Some of the signs and chants have already been made. Here are a few examples:

“Hey hey. Ho ho. Spoiligarchy has got to go.”

“No queens, no crowns. We the subs will not bow down.”

“Let’s all use some common sense.  No more Dommes who act so dense.”

“I don’t know but I’ve been told a lot of Dommes are really cold.”

“Ho ho. Hey hey. Submissive rights are here to stay.”

“You know which Dommes are the best?  Those who never manifest.”

“Greediness knows no end. 86 4 digit sends.”

“Fe if fo fum many Dommes are really dumb.”

“Los sumisos unido jamás será vencido.”

“Say it loud, say it clear. Coffee subs are welcome here.”

“Findom really starts to stink when Dommes call this a luxury kink.”

“Say it clear and say it loud. Small send subs are also proud.”

“No queens. No tyrants. We the subs will not be silent.”

“Cashism is fascism.”

“Where are your sends coming from?  There is no fin without some dom.”

Subs and Dommes, feel free to add some more. It’s only in fun after all.

To show up and be there for people. I've been told im very funny too. But ever since 7th grade I've never been able to have a consistent friend group. I was never someone's first choice. The fact that I had different interests from other women might've had an impact too. But I see people having such strong bonds even without that. 

Now im a grown adult. I have two close friends that both left the country, and one that lives in another city (they don't know each other). 
 Even my cousins have their own group and don't invite me since it would be awkward.

I get invited every time for coffee after lectures, but I cant call them close friends. 

I've been studying myself and reading on to find if i'm one of those people that don't realize they're unlikable.The only thing I found is that I often can't join people on certain events because im constantly studying since my degree is very demanding.

Now as an adult: who would I invite at my wedding? 3 people? 
I'm bored on a sunday? Can't invite no one for anything. 

It's just sad. It's the ONE thing I've dreamed of all my life. Just wanted a small group of friends to watch movies, go camping, for coffee. Have inside jokes.

How do I deal with this? People are all very grown now they already have someone close to them.

You'd see these AI-generated posts where a phrase like “best SaaS marketing tools” was jammed in 30 times, maybe even hidden in a white font. And for a while, it worked. But frankly, I'm relieved that game is over. For me, keyword stuffing always felt like the online equivalent of a desperate salesperson.

It's like walking into a store and the guy just says, “If you want the best coffee mug, Get colored coffee mugs. our coffee mugs are the best coffee mugs!” Enough with the mugs man. It’s exhausting and it instantly destroys any credibility they might had on me.

I admit that I learned this the hard way when we writing blogs for Mentio. I found out that the keyword stuffing sends one clear signal to the reader: we care more about the algorithm than we do about you. It breaks trust from the very first sentence. And that's the core of the problem. We get so obsessed with trying to figure out the algorithm when we should be focused on the person on the other side of the screen.

I learned that people don't care about the tech under the hood; they care about their problem being solved. SEO is no different. Readers don't care about our keyword density. They just want me to answer their damn question. As soon as we started doing that, the results were obvious to me. New posts started getting indexed while the old, keyword-stuffed ones were dead in the water (we're actively removing them).

In my experience, 80% of technical SEO is just pure delusion. So my new SEO strategy is simple: Don’t try to game the system. Be useful. Be clear. Be real.",6,1749987165.0,SaaS,6,0.69,False

I'm new to espresso and here is my issue :

I'm surprised to have such a huge timing difference with so little change of grind size and so it's very difficult to reach the ""ideal"" timing of 25\~30sec

\- Grinder : DF64 (I didnt seasoned it yet)

My workflow :  
\- espresso machine started since 20minutes  
\- Profitec Go at 10 bar with blind filter (as recommanded by Whole Latte Love)  
\- PID Water Temperature for coffee setting : 93°C (=199,4°F)  
\- Volvic water  
\- Fresh coffee bean (I mean, not old, opened 1 week ago, bought recently, best before 05/2027, dark or medium (?) roast)

\- 16g of coffee bean (0,56 oz) - Profitec Go basket is supposed to be a 14g one  
\- 32g of coffee (1,12 oz)  
\- WDT technique (MHW-3Bomber WDT Tool 2.0)  
\- Tamper : Normcore v4 (with spring, so consistent ""tampering"")  
\- Basket : original Profitec ""two cup"" one (14g)  
\- Portafilter : original Profitec one  
\- no puck screen

Note :  
\- I do own a bottomless portafilter, a Pullman basket (17-22g) and a puck screen but I wanted to start wit the Profitec original ones to then see the difference

Stardate 2375.04.13 | Day 21 of Trade Route

The usual void. Black, endless, and indifferent. I stared out the viewport at nothing but pinpricks of distant stars and the cold glare of a dead planet looming below.

Out here, routine is your friend. Familiar routes, predictable signals, boring static. I’ve run this trade corridor a dozen times, hauling supplies to the fringe colonies. The life of a merchant isn’t glamorous. It’s paperwork, waiting, and the occasional jump through hyperspace.

Being a space merchant for the intergalactic underground wasn’t my first choice after the Exodus Event. But it’s what’s left. You take what you can get to keep the credits coming in.

This gig came through one of my old informants, a guy who usually knows which rocks to kick over and which to avoid. Said it was high-paying and off the grid, perfect for someone like me. The Appalachian Colony tends to keep to itself; not many merchants bother going that far out unless they’re desperate or reckless. But apart from the handsome load of credits… it’s been a while since I felt something new. So I took it.

It’s been twenty days since I left with the goods; four more to go before I reach Appalachian, a dustball out past the edge of the Cygnus Rift. All systems look stable and for now, that’s enough.

Still not sure why they need a shipment of outdated tech — analog panels, power converters, and deadlinks (Old comms system radios whose channels are discontinued). Stuff no one’s used since before the Exodus. Maybe they’re running a salvage op. Or maybe they’re just desperate. Either way, they’re paying more than it’s worth, and I didn’t ask questions. You learn not to.

This job’s become so mechanical over time, and honestly? I don’t mind. There’s a certain comfort in it. Flip a few switches, check a few numbers, keep the engine warm. Lather, rinse, repeat.

The cargo hold hums quietly behind me. The circulation system cycles every few minutes with a soft whoosh. It’s the kind of white noise that makes you forget just how alone you are.

That’s the thing no one tells you about space, it’s not the danger that gets to you. It’s the quiet. At first, it’s peaceful. Then it starts pressing in. Makes you feel like something’s waiting just outside the hull.

Anyway, I’ll run a hull integrity sweep after this, maybe recalibrate the coolant flow on Deck B. Just need something to keep the silence from getting too loud.

End log.

Stardate 2375.04.14 | Entry 1 - Day 22 of Trade Route

The stars looked a little duller this morning — if it even is morning out here. Hard to tell when the only thing that changes is the hum of the engine and the low flicker of instruments against your face.

Today’s route takes me through a Tier 3 asteroid belt — nothing major, just a scatter of rocks along the trade path. The nav system flagged it last night. Tier 3s are barely worth noting. Autopilot handles them with smooth corrections every few seconds. I’ve passed worse in sleep mode.

Still, protocol says I’m supposed to stay alert during transit. So here I am, sipping rehydrated coffee and watching numbers tick across the console.

⸻

[+1 hour later]

Approaching the belt now. Navigation systems show everything’s nominal — proximity sensors ticking like metronomes. Autopilot hasn’t flinched once.

But here’s the thing: this belt doesn’t look like any standard asteroid field I’ve seen. Something feels… off.

From the viewport, the rocks aren’t scattered like they should be. They’re sparse — spread out thin, like breadcrumbs leading somewhere. Then there are these dense pockets, almost like clumps suspended in still water, while everything in between is eerily calm… and magnetically charged?

Yeah. That’s the other thing — the readings. The magnetic field here is stronger than expected. Patchy, too. Some zones are dead silent, others spike like they’re reacting to me. That’s not how belts work. Not naturally. But I’m here now. Can’t back out of the trade.

⸻

[Entering the belt]

For a moment, the nav systems flickered — just a blink — and then the satellites dropped offline. No comms. No positional feedback. Dead space.

But the autopilot’s still holding course. The route to Appalachian Colony is stored locally, and the system’s locked in. As long as that holds, I’m good.

Sensors are struggling. The hull picked up a mild charge — nothing serious yet. But I’ll have to do a manual reboot once I’m clear of the magnetic swell.

Truth is, I’ve seen worse. Pirates, reactor failures, even outran a collapsing jumpgate once. But this part of space is quiet in the wrong way. Like stepping into a room right after someone left — the air still holding their shape.

My informant warned me: you don’t screw up a gig with the Appalachians. They don’t send reminders. Just silence. And I believe him.

So, long as the cargo’s safe, I’ll keep going. That’s the deal.

Stardate 2375.04.14 | Entry 2 — Day 22 of Trade Route

It’s been a few hours since the first entry. The systems held steady at first, but now they’re starting to degrade. Slowly, but definitely — a flicker here, a delay there. The magnetic field interference is worse than I thought. Feels like I’m dragging the ship through static.

I’m almost clear of this so-called asteroid belt — if you can even call it that — but I don’t know how much longer the ship can handle this pressure. The internal temps are rising, minor systems are cycling on and off, and the main diagnostics screen just flashed red before blinking back to green. Never a good sign.

I’ve rerouted power to the boosters. Not full burn — that’d tear the hull apart in this field — but 30% should be enough to punch through the remaining section. Hopefully before any more damage sets in.

Engaging boosters… now.

Stardate 2375.04.14 | Entry 3 — Day 22 of Trade Route

System timestamp says I missed a few hours. I must’ve blacked out after the emergency thrusters fired.

I’ve just come to. Everything hurts.

The restraints probably saved my life, but my shoulder feels dislocated, and I’ve got dried blood along the side of my helmet. No idea how long we’ve been off course. Long enough for the ship to drift into deadspace, that’s for sure.

We’re no longer inside the belt. That’s the good news. But something hit the ship and whatever part of the ship took the hit… it did a number on us. The nav is fried. Half the panels are dark or looping error codes. The ship thinks we’re still mid-jump — we’re not.

Outside, it’s empty. A vast stretch of black I don’t recognize. No relay beacons. No trade routes on the scope. I cross-checked the star patterns — nothing matches. I’m near the edge of an unmarked sector. That shouldn’t even be possible. But here we are.

Life support is stable — barely. Emergency power’s running most of the key systems, though the engines are offline. Looks like the Argus took a hard knock to her belly, maybe clipped the coolant main during that spin. I’ll have to run a crawl inspection later, assuming I can even get into the maintenance shaft with one arm half-dead.

Emergencies protocols must have kicked in and sealed off the damaged compartments and rerouted the remaining juice to the comms and sensors. No distress signals going out yet — I need to make sure the antenna array isn’t completely shot.

All I’ve got is drift and silence. And a weird faint buzz occasionally coming through the lower comms band . Could be feedback, could be a signal. Could be my head still ringing.

Whatever this place is… it wasn’t on the route.

End log.

Stardate 2375.04.14 | Entry 4 — Day 22 of Trade Route

Tried the comms again — nothing. Still dead. No outgoing signals, no response from nearby relays, if there even are any out here. Whatever hit us scrambled more than just navigation.

With no connection and no way to call for help, I figured I’d check the cargo. Not that I care much about the payment right now, but it’s all I’ve got left that might make sense.

The hold’s a mess. Half the crates got tossed during the spinout. Several are cracked open, contents scattered. Old tech — analog panels, rusted converters, comm units I haven’t seen outside a museum.

Why a colony on the edge of nowhere needs outdated hardware is beyond me. Maybe now I’ll never find out.

I was about to close up and head back when something made me stop. A faint sound, buried in the background hum. Static.

I followed the sound to one of the old comm units, half-buried under torn packaging and busted clamps.

Everything else is fried — top-tier systems, modern long-range relays, even the emergency beacon.

But somehow… this ancient, pre-Exodus comm radio is still working.

I picked it up to listen closely.

A message, sounding almost cartoonish and delighted , cutting through the static on loop:

“… you are now within De͞a̸d̴li̶n͝k parameters. Comms channel will be activated in T-minus 59 minutes. Stay tuned… and welcome to your new home.”

The message made me stand rooted to the ground. Was this some kind of practical joke? I tried responding

“If you can hear me, I require urgent assistance, I repeat, my ship argus is dead in space. I require urgent assistance”

I listened to the message again hoping I’d get a response. However all I got was the same looped message. But something was off, each loop had a slightly different message.

“… you are now within De͞a̸d̴li̶n͝k parameters. Comms channel will be activated in T-minus 56 minutes. Stay tuned… and welcome to your new home.”

Was I imagining that the countdown reduced? I listened again.

“… you are now within De͞a̸d̴li̶n͝k parameters. Comms channel will be activated in T-minus 55 minutes. Stay tuned… and welcome to your new home…John.”

This isn’t an ordinary looped message, Whatever this thing is, it knows who I am.

Let's go see our great friend, our boss 👀

**Summary** : You've been his personal stylist for years. He's a successful businessman from a powerful and well-known family. To design outfits that match his mood and image perfectly, you've become more than just a professional—you're his closest friend and trusted confidant. 

Lately, his family has been setting him up on a string of blind dates, hoping to find him a suitable partner. Though he reluctantly goes along with it, he avoids discussing the topic with you—too embarrassed to admit he can’t say no to their pressure.

You, however, have been harboring secret feelings for him. And the thought of him ending up with someone else—of having to style them one day—is becoming unbearable. 

So, you make a painful decision : resign. And this announcement will leave him pretty shaken. 

**SCRIPT**

**\[In his office\]** 

**\[To his assistant, Claude\]** — *Neutral, work tone*   
The case with that group is closed. What else do we need to schedule, Claude ? 

**\[Claude answers\]** 

*Annoyed, tired*   
Another blind date… With who this time ? 

**\[Claude answers\]** 

**\[Doesn't really care\]** — *Indifferent*   
Mmh. Don’t know them. Probably the heir to another conglomerate or someone from a “good” family. 

*Sighs*   
I’ll do what I always do—play nice over drinks, smile politely, and decline without causing a scene. 

I still can’t believe my family keeps throwing suitors at me like I’m a project to be completed. 

**\[Claude says something\]** 

Indeed, Claude. Indeed. 

*Slight boost of energy*   
Well, at least I’ll look fantastic, as always. 

Maybe that’s why people assume I’m invested in these meetings— I suppose it’s hard to believe someone would dress this well just to say no. 

*Chuckles softly*   
But the truth is… I’m not the one putting in that effort. That credit goes to my brilliant stylist. My miracle worker. My fairy godparent with the magic hands. 

**\[Claude compliments the Listener\]** 

Couldn’t have said it better myself. I’m genuinely lucky to have them on my team. 

*More sincere, more personal*   
Honestly... I don’t know what I’d do without them. I don’t know what I’d do with my life without them. 

**\[Knock at the office door\]** 

*Amused*   
Speak of the devil.

**\[To the Listener, through the door\]** 

Come in. 

**\[Door opens\]** 

**\[To Claude\]** 

You’re done for the day, Claude. Head home. Have a good evening. 

**\[Claude says goodbye, exits\] \[Door closes\]** 

**\[To Listener\]** — *Good mood*   
We were just talking about you. How’s my favorite employee doing ? 

*Playful*   
Don’t tell Claude I said that. 

**\[Listener isn’t cheerful\]** 

*Concerned shift*   
Hey… is something wrong ? You look serious. 

**\[Listener hands him a letter\]** 

**\[Takes the letter\]** — *Curious*   
What’s this ? 

**\[Starts reading\]** — *Tone turns sharp, angry*   
What… is this. 

**\[Listener explains\]** 

*Still cold, confused*   
I can see it’s a resignation letter. I want to know why is your name on it. 

**\[Listener says a few vague things\]** 

**\[Stands suddenly\]** — *Angry*   
What are you talking about ? I don’t understand. What do you mean, “resign” ? 

**\[Listener talks about their replacement\]** 

I don’t give a damn about a replacement—this isn’t about logistics ! Don’t hide behind professionalism. We’ve moved past that a long time ago, and you know it. So cut the act and answer me—why are you leaving ?! 

**\[Listener vaguely says it's personal\]** 

*Still angry but more hurt*   
Personal matter ? That’s all you’ll say ? Since when do we not share personal matters anymore ? 

You’re the first person I go to—when things are good or bad. You held me together when my grandmother passed. You sat with me for hours, just listening. You let me cry and ramble without once making me feel ashamed. 

And when you saw your ex at that gala ? We laughed about it all night. You were radiant, proud, free. We celebrated your healing. Your success. 

And now… now you hand me a letter and won’t even look me in the eye ? 

**\[Listener stays silent\]** 

**\[Notices Listener's expression\]** — *Voice softens*   
Wait… Are you okay ? Is something wrong ? Are you in trouble or someone close to you ? 

**\[Listener says no\]** 

*Guilt creeping in*   
Then… it’s me, isn’t it ? Did I do something ? Say something ? 

Please… if I hurt you, just tell me. Don’t leave me in the dark like this. I can’t lose you—not like this. 

**\[Listener says they can’t tell me, vulnerable\]** 

*Lower, softer voice*   
You… can’t tell me. 

**\[Listener starts tearing up\]** 

*Gently, comforting*   
Hey… hey, it’s okay. Breathe. Look at me. 

Take a deep breath in with me, alright ? Just follow my pace. 

**\[Breathes in slowly, intentionally\]** 

There you go. Inhale… 

**\[Pauses, then exhales\]** 

Now exhale. Just like that. 

Good… you’re doing great. You’re safe here. Nothing you feel is wrong or has to be hidden. 

*Very gently, caution*   
Can I touch you ? Just to help ground you. A hand... your shoulder... or maybe a hug ? Only if you're okay with it. 

**\[Listener nods\]** 

*Tender, emotional shift*   
Alright. Come here. 

**\[Embraces the Listener gently, grounding\]** — *Concerned*   
You’re shaking… 

It’s okay. You don’t have to say anything right now if you don’t feel ready. Just let me hold you. I’m here. I’m not going anywhere. 

Whatever this is—whatever you're feeling—we’ll figure it out together. But don’t shut me out. Please don’t carry this alone. 

You matter too much to me for that. 

**\[Pause — Listener has calmed down a bit\]** 

*Still gentle, warm*   
You feel ready to talk to me ? Alright. I’m here. No pressure, take your time. 

**\[Listener begins to explain\]** 

**\[Try to understand\]** — *Curious, still kind but cautious*   
The blind dates… You say you can’t keep doing that anymore ? What do you mean ? 

Because if this is about the work, your designs have always been flawless. Every outfit you create for me is pitch-perfect—elegant, sharp, exactly what I need, even when I don’t know it myself. 

So I know this isn't about the quality of your work. It never was. 

**\[Listener answers something emotional\]** 

**\[Search for clarity\]** — *More puzzled*   
It’s… not about the clothes ? Then I… 

**\[Interrupts himself to stay focused on Listener\]** — *Gentle*   
No, okay. I’m listening. Please, keep going. I want to understand. 

**\[Listener explains further\]** 

You… You couldn’t bring yourself to dress someone I’d be dating ? 

**\[Pauses\]** — *Confused*   
Why ? 

**\[Listener doesn’t answer, clearly embarrassed\]** 

*Softer, with concern and tenderness*   
Dear ? 

**\[Listener confesses their feelings for him\]** 

**\[Falls into silence. Eyes flicker, caught off guard\]** *— Surprise*   
Wait… You… You’re saying… All this time… you’ve had feelings for me ? 

*Stunned*   
I… I didn’t see it. I mean… I thought we were close—are close—but I never imagined… 

**\[Starts reflecting aloud\]** *— Quiet voice*   
But… now that I think about it… You never asked about the blind dates. Not once.

We talk about everything. You ask about my morning coffee, the headaches from my board meetings, even the pregnant cat from my local bookstore to know if she's had her kittens yet… 

But not once did you ever ask how the dates went. You always changed the subject or made yourself busy. 

**\[The realization starts settling in, deeper\]** 

And that night— That dinner event at the museum last month—remember ? You helped me with the tie, and your hands were shaking just a little. You smiled like always, but your eyes didn’t follow. And when I joked about one of the guests being “a strong candidate,” you went silent. Just… vanished from the conversation for the rest of the night. 

God… 

**\[Looks back at Listener\]** *— Softly*   
You were hurting. And I didn’t even see it. 

*Sincere, guilt-tinged but gentle*   
You’ve been standing next to me all this time, helping me shine, taking care of everything I needed— And the one thing you needed... I couldn’t see. 

**\[Listener apologizes for their inappropriate feelings\]** 

*Kind but firm*   
No, stop that. Don’t apologize. There’s no reason for it. 

I feel… 

**\[Pauses\]** *— Hesitates*   
I feel honored. Truly. 

But before I say anything more—I want to point out that, in fact, you never asked me about my blind dates. But, I never brought them up, either. Never. Not to you at least. You know why ? 

**\[Listener shakes their head “no”\]** 

Because I didn’t want to. Because every single one of them was pushed on me by my parents. They want me married off, settled and secured in ways that benefit their vision of the family’s legacy.   
And I—

*Exhales, more introspective*   
I didn’t talk about it because… I didn’t want to look weak… like a man who just folds under pressure. Especially not to you. 

I’ve spent so much of my life making sure I look strong, competent, in control— Someone people can rely on. 

*Softer*   
Someone you could rely on. 

And somehow, somewhere in that… I convinced myself that if I told you about these pointless dates and admitted how little say I had in them—You’d think less of me. That maybe I’d seem… small. Less powerful. Less desirable. 

*Soft, almost self-deprecating laugh*   
Which is stupid, isn’t it ? You’ve never judged me. Not once. Not when I was grieving. Not when I was exhausted or even when I was a complete bastard during budget season. 

You’ve always seen me for who I am. Even when I couldn’t. 

**\[Moves a little closer\]** *— Gentler, soft guilt*   
I never explain how much I hated those dates or tell you I was only doing them to pacify my parents. Because of that, you were left to imagine the worst. To think I was searching—I wanted someone else beside me. 

And I hate to know that my silence made you feel like you had to leave. Like there was no space for you here. 

**\[Listener asks why their opinion matter so much to him\]** 

*Softer, sincere*   
Your opinion matters so much to me… because you’re not just my stylist. You’re my closest friend, my confidant. My favorite person to talk to after a long day… the one who owns my heart. 

You make me want to be better, even when it’s hard. And being seen, especially by you. 

I want to be strong for you. Reliable for you. Attractive to you. It’s always for you. Even if sometimes, when it comes to my family… I’m just a little scared. 

**\[Looks down for a beat, then back at Listener\]** *— Hesitant, a bit shy*   
Do you… Do you still love me ? Even knowing that a part of me gets nervous and avoids conflict with the people who raised me ? 

**\[Listener answers yes, they still love him\]** 

**\[Visibly touched smile forming\]** *— Relieved*   
God. You have no idea what that means to me. What you mean to me. 

**\[Leans in slowly\]** *— Gentle*   
May I…? 

**\[Soft, genuine kiss — nothing rushed, just warm and affirming\]** 

*Quiet laugh after the kiss*   
Well. I think I just found the perfect way to get my family off my back. No need for another blind date… I already have someone. 

**\[Turns slightly toward his desk, spots the resignation letter\]** 

Oh—right. 

**\[Takes it and tears it in two with a soft smile\]** *— With satisfaction*   
We won’t be needing this letter anymore, will we ? 

**\[Gazes at the Listener, heartfelt and full of love\]** *— Sincere*   
I love you, my dear stylist.   
And I will make sure to prove it to you every day from now on. 

**\[End\]**

When Cunan first learned about Father’s Day, he immediately started on gathering intel about what to give Ozpin to show his appreciation for him due to taking him in. After that, Cunan tried to make some steaks, bought some coffee mugs and beans, and get the man some clothes…only for himself to get banned from working in Beacon’s kitchens due to causing a fire (and burning the poor steaks), accidentally breaking the coffee machine because he couldn’t figure out how to work it nor did he know that you’re supposed to grind the beans, and buying clothes that weren’t the right size (and were honestly quite tacky as well…). 

Ozpin, however, was more amused than angry since after the whole incident with Mother’s Day, he knew that Cunan meant well and decided to spend the day with him instead. They exchanged the clothes for the proper size, got a new coffee machine for the staff room (while teaching the boy how to make good coffee) and ended the day with going to a burger joint.

1lbxk22,https://www.reddit.com/r/2brokegirls/comments/1lbxk22/ranking_the_seasons/,Ranking The Seasons,"My ranking of the seasons from best to worst

1 - Season 3 - For me this has some of the most heartfelt moments of the show - when Caroline's nanny dies and discovers her secret life and the gang showing to Max's graduation. I love seeing how far Max and Caroline's characters have come, we get to see Max be more sentimental and her hunger for ambition while Caroline is more appreciative of her current life and how it's better than her previous. I love the cupcake kitchen, beautiful design and I liked seeing them doing well after the failure of the first shop. Has memorable characters Deke, Bebe and Luis and a great appearance by Lindsey Lohan as an indecisive bride. It also has some the funniest moments in the show, like taking jobs at Starbucks just so they can learn to use a coffee machine, Deke's dumpster, the wedding cake, meeting Han's mother, meeting the old guy they sublet from.

2. Season 1 - Funny from beginning to end, with Max's crudeness and attitude and Caroline attempting to adjust with her new lifestyle. Love seeing how the friendship forms and how they start their cupcake business and all the different ways they try to make money. Some great emotional moments like Max waking Chestnut, Caroline selling her rings to buy Max her oven, Earl's heart attack, Max taking Caroline to visit her Dad in prison on her birthday. So many hilarious scenes like serving cupcakes at Johnny's girlfriend's event, meeting Sophie, Max's tattooed ex in prison, working as elves, the coupons and meeting Martha Stewart.

3. Season 2 - I love seeing the girls open a cupcake shop and lose it, it's unfortunate but it happens a lot so not unrealistic. I like Caroline's relationship with Candy Andy, it's unfortunate it doesn't workout but again it's realistic I've seen relationships fall apart because of business. It was great seeing Caroline's dad, good casting choice in Steven Webber, also brilliant casting Missi Pyle as Caroline's evil aunt. Has hilarious moments like the diner being robbed, Cupcake Wars, TV show being filmed at the diner, the puppeteer, the cabin.

4. Season 4 - I initially wrote off this season, but I gave it another chance and it's not as bad as I remember it being. While not as good as the first 3 season but it's still far better than what came after. Sure I could've done without Nashit but thankfully he's not in it for very long. I love the idea of the girls trying to expand their business by selling t-shirts only for it to backfire and put them in debt, unfortunate but again realistic I've seen similar to happen to other businesses. I also like them getting jobs at the dessert restaurant, nice little payoff to Max going to pastry school and even bringing back ""Big Mary"". I also like how they let their new jobs get in the way of running the cupcake business, it happens sometimes it's easier to get settled in your current job and neglect your own business. Also enjoyed the finale with Sophie and Oleg's wedding. Nice hilarious moments too like the girls getting arrested, the dye factory fight, Caroline's hair getting stuck, renting out their apartment to supermodels.

5. Season 5 - To me the show jumped the shark when they received the movie deal which gives them their 250k target. The whole drive of the show was the girls starting from nothing and experiencing all the highs and lows of running a business, so getting the movie deal feels like a copout, I don't like the idea that Caroline's story would've made her rich again eventually. 

6. Season 6 - What a snore fest. This is why the girls making their fortune and getting their dessert bar should've been endgame. They got their dream what else there to go? They even had to come up with contrived ways to make them 'broke' to live up to the title. I honestly can't think of anything I liked about this season, even Max and Caroline feel like shadows of their characters. It doesn't surprise me it was cancelled.

1lbxfb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1lbxfb8/dazed_and_confused_on_a_weekend_getaway/,Dazed and confused on a weekend getaway,"I had been seeing a guy since January and we were casual. But we had good rapport and a friendship forming, and sex was good. 
He moved to an island resort about two months ago to work as a sous chef. We were still in constant contact and he invited me out to the island for a few days. I said yes, and this was the past weekend. We had a lot of excitement and preamble in the weeks leading up and both genuinely looking forward to seeing each other. 

The weekend started out great, he picked me up from the airport and even had a welcome cocktail for me that he made. He booked a very fancy fine dining restaurant that night and we got dressed to the nines and went out for dinner. 

Everything was going well, and he was really thoughtful, made space on the side of the bed for me for my stuff, bought my favourite oat milk, considerate about bathroom space too. 
The next day, we just hung out at the beach and chilled out, swimming, chatting, laughing, and just exploring the island like a couple of honeymooners. 
He made me dinner that night, and with some wine the mood was right and I foolishly started to fall for him.

The third day, he had booked a lovely lunch on a gorgeous island, a short ferry ride away. We had a wonderful time, we laughed and enjoyed ourselves, and just got close. We took lots of pictures of us as a couple to cherish the moment. 
We drank a bottle of wine at lunch and we kept drinking when we got back to his place. 

We were making plans for the future and I mentioned that maybe I will come back in a couple of months. We had also previously planned a trip to Japan in October and he even booked leave for it. 

When I had mentioned these plans, he got a little awkward. 
So I said, “talk to me. What’s going on?”
And he said, “I wanted to wait until the end of the weekend but something has changed and I don’t feel the connection for you that I thought I did.”

“Go on…”

He said, “I can’t really pinpoint what it is but I know that I’m not into this, or into you as you are into me.” 

I grabbed a glass of wine on the table and poured myself enough to down it in one go, noticing that I was getting proper drunk. So my cognitive functioning was at an all time low. 
As coherently as I could muster, I said, “thank you for telling me, and feeling safe enough to tell me. Of course your feelings are valid and I appreciate that we can communicate this way.” …or at least a slurred mumbled version of that.

I excused myself and went to the bathroom and burst into tears, quietly into my dress, and tried to regulate my emotions. 

I came out of the bathroom and blurted out that I had something to tell him. But words left me and I just cried. I sort of blacked out after that and only remembered bits and pieces of the evening. I don’t think I even told him what I had wanted to. 

From what I can remember, he was kind. He made sure I was ok, that I had water to drink, and food in my stomach. He wiped my face with a cloth because I apparently didn’t stop crying. He rubbed my back and said it was all going to be ok. 
We slept in the same bed that night, and I remember reaching out to him and wrapped my arm around him, fearing that he would pull away, but he pulled me closer and held my hand while we slept. 

The only way I can describe how he makes me feel is, safe and at ease. We may not have the sparks but it felt deeper than that. And I was left so confused as well. Just a mix of emotions. 

The last day was awkward. We were awkward, but he still made me breakfast, he still made me coffee, and gave me a couple of pain killers for my hangover. 
I sat down with him and I apologised for being embarrassingly drunk. I asked if I had said anything that was inappropriate or hurtful the night before. 
He said, “You mentioned still being in love with someone else and you were hoping dating me would make you love him less?”

My subconscious was probably working over time to save face at that point. (A story for another day)
I winced as he told me this and I asked, “how do you feel about that?” 

He said, “I’m ok - a little blindsided but I think it’s good we have reached this level of honesty.”
I said, “it wasn’t exactly the weekend we were expecting huh?” 
He said, “it was still great to have been with you all weekend.” 
There was an awkward pause… 

Then he said, “let’s go for a walk before your flight, get you some air.”

On our walk we discussed our feelings in deeper detail. How we were in different stages of our healing journeys, how we were grateful to have found each other. How we have deepened a friendship even if there is still attraction there. But neither of us wanted anything long term, he loved gaining his independence back and I didn’t want to lose mine. It was all very mature and in some ways, I didn’t feel as heartbroken as I had the night before. 

Before he dropped me off to the airport, I asked him if I could have one last kiss. He obliged.

Then at the airport, he kissed me again. Held my head between his hands and kissed me, deeply.
I said, “oh one final last ever goodbye kiss, huh?” 
He said, “why does everything have to be final? This isn’t the end, just part one.”

So I said,
“You know, platonically, I love you.”
And he said,
“I love you too.”

And I got on a plane, a little less heartbroken. So I guess in some ways it was a success? I am still a bit confused though. 
Mostly because as far as I knew we were ‘casual’ and feelings were not supposed to be part of the equation. But I guess 4 days together in constant proximity would change that.

Our relationship has been great, he's very gentle, kind and caring. We met in college, and at the time we began texting each other a lot. It eventually progressed from voicecalls where we'd watch shows together to videocalls. 
Now onto the issue. While I love to hear his voice, I've grown super attached to the videocalls because we're parcially long-distance and seeing him means a lot more to me than just listening. I mostly use my phone to make the calls (I have a really old laptop lol) and place it somewhere nearby while he uses his gaming laptop's camera. He recently bought a gaming setup which made him really happy and hyped up to play video-games with improved quality. He's glowing, and I was so happy for him. But when I asked him how he'd do for videocalls, he said he wouldn't buy a Webcam because he can just use his phone (he installed an app which synchronized the phone to the PC).
It worked for a while but then I realized that if his phone battery died, I'd stop seeing him while he could still see me and he'd do nothing about it, because there was no place to charge the phone close to his desk. I grew a bit upset because I think the dynamic becomes unfair, and also because I think that this is sort of a receding in what we were used to (going back to voicecalls). So I voiced my concerns to him and he got mad, telling me he won't waste any more money when he has a camera on his phone and that I'm creating problems where they don't exist. We got into a heated argument and my anger was through the roof, I accused him of not putting as much effort into our relationship as I did. By that point I was in tears, then he suggested to buy an USB cable so that his phone could charge by the setup and still keep up the videocall, but I said he's missing the point. After some back and forth which led nowhere, I cut the call short. 
It's been 2 days and we haven't really talked besides ""good morning"" and ""good night"" texts. I was thinking of leaving him over this because, if he's not willing to compromise on something so simple, what about bigger things in the future? I was pretty confident in my stance until today, when I met a friend at a local coffee shop. I told her everything I've said above but in the end she said that I blew things out of proportion because he hasn't cut videocalls at all and I shouldn't break up with him over something so shallow.
I feel conflicted. Would I be wrong if I broke up with him? ",1,1749984134.0,BreakUps,3,0.99,False

1lbxdho,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1lbxdho/am_i_getting_breadcrumbed/,Am I getting breadcrumbed?,"A little info to preface with.

I'm a 42F, recently divorced after a 13 year relationship (married for 6, together before that for 7), and separated for 2 years before divorce. So I've been out of the dating scene for 15 years and am completely new to OLD. All of my previous partners in my life before my ex were always friends first, so I feel like I've never done ""conventional"" dating.

Shockingly, the first guy I connected with (44M) is pretty much an instant match. Lots of shared interests, same type of dorky sense of humour, kind, goes to therapy, good communicator.

We connected a little over a month ago, had daily conversations from that point on, and then went for a coffee date after about a week of chatting (he initiated). Conversation was free-flowing with good energy to the point where we lost track of time. So we had another coffee date later that week. Same scenario, despite the fact that I had shocking laryngitis. Still having daily conversations between that which evolved to leaving voice notes instead of texts.

So we go on our first ""proper"" date about a week and a half after that. Movies and dinner. Lovely time, more free flowing conversation. He paid for everything (despite my protests) and had also baked me cookies that he brought along for me to take home.

He walked me back to my car and I took initiative and held his hand, then kissed him. It evolved into a pretty steamy half-hour make out session, with a lot of passion coming from him. I was excited that we had good physical chemistry.

The next day, he sent me a very kind and honest voice note to say he thought we'd moved too fast on the physical side of things, but that he still wanted to see me and spend time getting to know me to ensure it would be something lasting. He was also cognisant that this was my first time dating in 15 years and wanted to be mindful that I wasn't getting swept up in the excitement of everything. I agreed and appreciated his emotional maturity.

That was almost two weeks ago and since then, communication has slowed. What went from (often multiple) daily messages has petered out to maybe one message every 2-3 days. We're both busy people (he has a teenage daughter that he has half of the week and I'm very social by nature), so our free time hasn't aligned, but I've also felt the enthusiasm he'd initially exhibited for wanting to get to know me has waned.

I could, of course, be completely overthinking it, but I can't say I'm not disappointed in the shift in energy. His messages are friendly enough (although they do seem to be getting shorter), but there's been no offer to set up another date. I've offered my availability a few times, but he's just not replied to it, which I feel is a pretty clear signal? He keeps telling me he's busy (which I am too, so no judgement), but it's hard to tell if he's legitimately trying to take it slow or if I've scared him off.

I know this is something I need to get clarity on by discussing it with him, but would love some honest opinions.",7,1749984064.0,datingoverforty,19,0.82,False

This might run long. It might feel like a lot. But if you’re someone who feels things too damn deeply, overthinks life during those 2:27 a.m. silences, or just quietly wants something real... something slow, honest, and not just a vibe curated for social media, then maybe this is for you.

Maybe this isn’t a coincidence. Maybe it’s a weird little sign. Maybe this is that leap of faith we've both been avoiding but kinda need.

I don’t think people show up in our lives by mistake.
Some are distractions. Some are detours.
But a few rare ones feel like destinations we didn’t even know we were searching for.
And when they show up, it’s like your soul just whispers, “this. this is what i’ve been missin.”

So hey, 

I’m 26. I’m a doctor.
And no, I’m not gonna diagnose you unless you sneeze in a really suspicious way and my reflex kicks in.

But I’m not just a guy in a white coat. I’m a certified nerd.
Like, not the aesthetic Tumblr-type nerd. The real kind.
I drop Marvel quotes in casual convos, question what timeline we’re even in, and I’m still lowkey mad at how certain movies messed up basic physics.

I fall in love with characters that don’t even exist.
I get stuck thinking about time, death, consciousness, memory, and whether we’re all just walking collections of nostalgia wrapped in flesh.
Sometimes I sit with chai like I’m the main character in a slow detective story, trying to solve a medical case mixed with a metaphysical crisis.
Other times I disappear into deep dives about marine biology, nanotech, or quantum stuff because my brain said, ""dig deeper bro, we ain't done.""

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a little Arabic (barely survival level).
Oh and I’m learning Klingon. Because why the hell not. Curiosity and chaos kinda are my love languages.

There’s this voice in my head

Not always nice. Not always soft.
But it pushes me.

It says things like:
Think harder.
Fix what’s broken.
Don’t settle.
Show up. Even when no one else does.

That voice keeps me going.
Not for grades. Not for a resume.
But because I need to understand the world. The people. The pain. The purpose.
From nanotech in medicine to how grief rewires the brain… I need to know.
Because surface-level stuff bores me. Always has.


---

So what am I looking for?

Let’s keep it simple. I want someone real.

Not someone who ghosts for a week and shows up with “hey”
Not someone who starts with “wyd” and ends it with “lol”
Not someone chasing aesthetics but scared of actual connection

I want the long weird convos.
The kind that start with memes and end with life, death, and what our childhood still haunts us with.

Someone who can say “I’m not okay today, can we just exist together for a while” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who sends a lyric because it hit too hard.
Someone who smells something and is instantly back in a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs at dumb memes like a gremlin and then goes dead silent thinking about souls, the stars, and why we hurt the people we love.

You don’t have to be perfect. Just human. Just honest. Just... there.

But more than anything right now, I want a study buddy

No, not the “we’ll do one Pomodoro and disappear forever” type.
I mean a real one.

You don’t have to be in medicine. You could be studying architecture, poetry, law, quantum physics, or just figuring out your life.
Hell, you could just be healing. That counts too.

I want someone to sit with, even virtually.
We don't have to talk all the time. We just have to exist in the same digital space while we both work on becoming better versions of ourselves.

Picture this:
Late night grind.
Lo-fi or rain sounds in the background.
Cups of coffee or chai.
That quiet presence that feels like a hug.
And every now and then, a break where we drop the dumbest memes or the deepest thoughts.

We keep each other accountable.
We remind each other why we started.
We check in on tough days.
We say, “hey, you got this. you're not alone.”
We don’t need to study the same topic. Just show up with the same fire. That’s it.

Maybe we start a weird little ritual. Like sending a quote before we begin. Or ending the night with a mini trivia game or a stupid challenge.
Doesn’t matter. As long as we’re growing together.

Send 4 a.m. voice notes when life’s too loud to type
Make dumb inside jokes that no one else gets
Build a little digital home made of shared silences and late-night chaos

Just a few confessions

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more times than I should admit
Neuroanatomy got interesting for me because of a throwaway Sherlock line
I’ve been broken, badly. But I always show up

I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth
I want someone who isn’t afraid to sit in the silence with me, and still feel connected

* Organic, decentralised, community based memecoin, transitioning into a brand coin
* On 3 chains: Ethereum, Solana and BASE
* 18.5k holders
* 23 million market cap
* Unprecedented Catalogue of IRL initiatives, some examples are Coffee, Energy drinks, Vapes, Plushies and merch
* The best community in the industry right now
* Insane social media efforts dominating Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, Stocktwits, TikTok and more
* HHI score of 39(this is very good)
* 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes, only other coin was PEPE
* Certik community score of 94/100, other ""cult"" memes are in the 70s
* ATH market cap of 283 million
* Appeared front and centre on a Coinbase advert

Although the rest of the market is down and there is a lot of frustration, at Kendu we have our head down and we are constantly grinding. The market is gonna change fast and when it does Kendu is gonna be ready to run the hardest due to all of the effort we are putting in right now.. I think of it like this, each bit of effort you put into a memecoin, it adds fuel for the next pump, causing you to go higher and higher.

**Why A Strong Community is Important** 

Coins backed by a strong community have always had the highest returns on investment, think Shib, Doge, Pepe.... all they had was an insanely strong community and Kendu will be no different. A strong cult like community provides a coin with constant free advertisement, makes crypto a fun thing to be apart of and generally reduces sell pressure due to a lot of belief being instilled into holders. 

I love being part of Kendu and have since realised Kendu is way more important than just a money printer, Kendu is a place to make lifelong connections and to meet great people from around the globe. We have massive communities in India, Netherlands, England, France, Germany, Spain, Nigeria, Australia and much more I am forgetting!

It is a no brainer, Kendu is going to the tens of billions with or without you, but do yourself a favour and get involved! We love to see new faces and if you want to release an IRL initiative under the Kendu umbrella, you are more than welcome to, everyone gets our support whether you have been here 1 day or since day 1.

In my opinion there is no way that Kendu will be below 10 billion market cap by the end of this cycle, so skip the Dominos Pizza and put the $20 into Kendu. This could easily be $20k, which is a downpayment on a house!

Let’s be real for a sec

This might run long. It might feel like a lot. But if you’re someone who feels things too damn deeply, overthinks life during those 2:27 a.m. silences, or just quietly wants something real... something slow, honest, and not just a vibe curated for social media, then maybe this is for you.

Maybe this isn’t a coincidence. Maybe it’s a weird little sign. Maybe this is that leap of faith we've both been avoiding but kinda need.

I don’t think people show up in our lives by mistake.
Some are distractions. Some are detours.

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re trading pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, alternate realities
Debate which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad British or Russian accents just for laughs
Send 4 a.m. voice notes when life’s too loud to type
Make dumb inside jokes that no one else gets
Build a little digital home made of shared silences and late-night chaos


---

Just a few confessions

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more times than I should admit
Neuroanatomy got interesting for me because of a throwaway Sherlock line
I’ve been broken, badly. But I always show up
I’ve walked alone, but never stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth
I want someone who isn’t afraid to sit in the silence with me, and still feel connected


---

So if you’re

A lil cracked but still showing up
Empathetic but steel-strong inside
Smart but weirdly soft in ways that count
Funny but carrying some quiet heaviness
Brilliant in your own messy, chaotic way

Then maybe, just maybe, this post makes some sense to you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No cool-guy act.
Just me. Tired. Honest. Still hoping.

So if any part of this made your chest feel warm or your brain go “same”, drop a meme, a quote, a song, a thought, anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with study sessions.
Two nerds in different corners of the world.
Showing up. Holding space. Growing stronger.

Together.

Because we’re all just stories.

Let’s make it a damn good one.

Still trying. Still here.

Let’s be real for a sec

This might run long. It might feel like a lot. But if you’re someone who feels things too damn deeply, overthinks life during those 2:27 a.m. silences, or just quietly wants something real... something slow, honest, and not just a vibe curated for social media, then maybe this is for you.

Maybe this isn’t a coincidence. Maybe it’s a weird little sign. Maybe this is that leap of faith we've both been avoiding but kinda need.

I don’t think people show up in our lives by mistake.
Some are distractions. Some are detours.
But a few rare ones feel like destinations we didn’t even know we were searching for.
And when they show up, it’s like your soul just whispers, “this. this is what i’ve been missin.”

So hey, 

I’m 26. I’m a doctor.
And no, I’m not gonna diagnose you unless you sneeze in a really suspicious way and my reflex kicks in.

But I’m not just a guy in a white coat. I’m a certified nerd.
Like, not the aesthetic Tumblr-type nerd. The real kind.
I drop Marvel quotes in casual convos, question what timeline we’re even in, and I’m still lowkey mad at how certain movies messed up basic physics.

I fall in love with characters that don’t even exist.
I get stuck thinking about time, death, consciousness, memory, and whether we’re all just walking collections of nostalgia wrapped in flesh.
Sometimes I sit with chai like I’m the main character in a slow detective story, trying to solve a medical case mixed with a metaphysical crisis.
Other times I disappear into deep dives about marine biology, nanotech, or quantum stuff because my brain said, ""dig deeper bro, we ain't done.""

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a little Arabic (barely survival level).
Oh and I’m learning Klingon. Because why the hell not. Curiosity and chaos kinda are my love languages.


---

There’s this voice in my head

Not always nice. Not always soft.
But it pushes me.

It says things like:
Think harder.
Fix what’s broken.
Don’t settle.
Show up. Even when no one else does.

That voice keeps me going.
Not for grades. Not for a resume.
But because I need to understand the world. The people. The pain. The purpose.
From nanotech in medicine to how grief rewires the brain… I need to know.
Because surface-level stuff bores me. Always has.


---

So what am I looking for?

Let’s keep it simple. I want someone real.

Not someone who ghosts for a week and shows up with “hey”
Not someone who starts with “wyd” and ends it with “lol”
Not someone chasing aesthetics but scared of actual connection

I want the long weird convos.
The kind that start with memes and end with life, death, and what our childhood still haunts us with.

Someone who can say “I’m not okay today, can we just exist together for a while” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who sends a lyric because it hit too hard.
Someone who smells something and is instantly back in a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs at dumb memes like a gremlin and then goes dead silent thinking about souls, the stars, and why we hurt the people we love.

You don’t have to be perfect. Just human. Just honest. Just... there.


---

But more than anything right now, I want a study buddy

No, not the “we’ll do one Pomodoro and disappear forever” type.
I mean a real one.

You don’t have to be in medicine. You could be studying architecture, poetry, law, quantum physics, or just figuring out your life.
Hell, you could just be healing. That counts too.

I want someone to sit with, even virtually.
We don't have to talk all the time. We just have to exist in the same digital space while we both work on becoming better versions of ourselves.

Picture this:
Late night grind.
Lo-fi or rain sounds in the background.
Cups of coffee or chai.
That quiet presence that feels like a hug.
And every now and then, a break where we drop the dumbest memes or the deepest thoughts.

We keep each other accountable.
We remind each other why we started.
We check in on tough days.
We say, “hey, you got this. you're not alone.”
We don’t need to study the same topic. Just show up with the same fire. That’s it.

Maybe we start a weird little ritual. Like sending a quote before we begin. Or ending the night with a mini trivia game or a stupid challenge.
Doesn’t matter. As long as we’re growing together.

1lbx9lu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lbx9lu/how_do_i_manage_the_cycle_of_grieving_and/,"How do I manage the cycle of grieving and reconnecting with my ""true love"" (34M, 33F)","This is a book. Yes there's a TL;DR but it's a good book I promise.

My senior year of high school I dated a girl that changed my life. I could go into detail on all the ways we bonded, but to keep it brief, she made me believe in love. Deep bond, like inner-child best friends deep. We were together close to a year then I left for college, being slightly older. Hormones were running wild and I knew I couldn't handle myself living far away. When we did meet up it started to feel like I was using her just to fool around. I felt so guilty treating her like that so I broke up with her...and to add salt to the wound it was right after we messed around. She left my place and I told her via text...or maybe it was over phone but still it was shitty way to end it. Needless to say, it broke her, as one would imagine.

Touching base every few months after but we eventually started dating other people. She became the emotional reference point for every relationship Ive been in for over 15 years. This is where it gets bad....I've left two long term relationships, one being a five year marriage, at the prospects of being with her again. I know, I know...but let me just give some context for entertainment purposes.

Since our breakup in 2008 we've been victims of bad timing. She would reach out to me when I was in a relationship or I would do the same to her. We had to block each other on and off over the years. It's always been out of respect for each other. But the god honest truth is that the entire time I've been praying for us to be together again one day. 

As an adult, my issue in relationships is that I stay longer than I should. I feel guilty and don't wanna hurt anyone. Both of my long term relationships (5 and 6 years) should have lasted 2 years tops if I had any self-respect. Shortly into my marriage (2013-2018), I started getting mentally plagued by memories of her. Found myself daydreaming and writing love songs in my head more often. They kept going on for a few years and I thought that if I reach out to her and shared how important she meant to me back then, I'd be able to let go and be a more emotionally available partner. Well I did that...aaand it didn't work. I only realized more and more that I didn't want to be married, that is to say...how much I wanted to be back with her. 

Got divorced and immediately tried to start something up. Bad idea #1. There was clear opposition to the idea of me rushing into something before processing what I ended. Also Im sure she didn't want to be THE reason I got divorced, which I would never openly say. 

She kept her distance over the next year while I was single and wouldn't really accept my attention...until I stopped giving it. Then she'd reach out and I'd end up expressing my feelings and she'd pull away again. 

I ended up in another relationship that was real hot and heavy on the front end and it pulled me out of our cycle. I told the new girl about the situation immediately. Bad Idea #2. Led to a lot of trust issues straight outta the gate. But imo they needed to know what they were signing up for, so I don't fully think it was a bad idea.

Sometime after covid she reached out following a breakup and she was very nostalgic, asking why the timing never worked out for us. We bonded again over our fav music and shared new things we were into and just kind of reconnected. she invited me to get coffee while she was in town (lives in different city) and I considered it but hadn't confirmed. *also coffee not code for hooking up. While were WERE sexually active (never had sex tho), it's always been more of an emotional thing*

At this point I was really trying to be a good partner. I shared the fact that she reached out. It was a BIG deal. My partner ended up secretly looking at my texts and claimed we were flirting and it broke her trust that was already shaky from the start. Obv didn't get coffee and spent the next year trying to repair trust and did some couple's counseling. 

One other time in 2023 during a very low point in my relationship I reached out to touch base and say hey and catch up. That was pretty much it. She invited me to a concert in my town but I respectfully declined and closed the conversation.

Okay, so that brings us to the present. You might want to sit down for this...

This April she hit me up out of nowhere and invited me to see one of our fav bands from back in our glory days together. For some reason this time the answer was a clear yes. Now out of respect, as if I had a shred of it left in me, I invited another mutual guy friend of ours to attend and so we all three went. 

Imma lose y'all when I say this...but when she arrived, we were both wearing deep green long sleeve button ups. I'll leave that there for the hopeless romantics and I'll try to keep this grounded. The connection felt so alive too. However I'm also anxious af because this is SO out of my comfort zone. 

Our friend with us asked if I was planning to get married soon. I said I wasn't sure yet. He joking replied ""its been six years, shouldn't you know by now?"". That hit me hard. He left after the show while she and I talked over a drink and she said she wanted an ""open line of communication"". I said that while I'd love that it's tricky given my situation and we said our goodbyes.

Two weeks go by, can't stop thinking about her.   I took my friend's words to heart. It was true, I've been dragging my feet for years with someone I couldn't fully commit to and ai should know by now. I ended the relationship like I was ripping a bandaid off. The decision had been made and I was working through how to have the conversation. It ended up happening during an argument and not in the best manner. The breakup was NOT amicable and all the old resentments and trust issues on both ends really came to the surface during our final month living together. 

Here's where I could really use some advice:

I jumped into thinking about ways we could reconnect now that I was single. Found a show in her town, bought two tix and casually invited he, like she did to me. She said yes, (big excitement) I went up there, had a great time, still very anxious and not in my comfort zone even tho I was technically single, she let me crash on her futon, she made me a fire breakfast, she took the next day off and we spent it together. In my book, it was a fn dream come true. 

That weekend she came into my town (not specifically for me) but we went on a ""date"" you could say. Another great time. talked in my car after about taking our time and how she was ""cautiously optimistic"", we shook hands playfully on my request to saying hello more often than saying goodbye, and had the best hug of my life as she left. 

I told her last month that in June I would be in her city for a week at a conference and she invited me to stay with her...for like 6 days people (holy crap I was so excited). Around that time she bought more tix to shows months away for us together. We had made some seriously exciting summer plans...AND it was mutual. 

But something major changed between our last ""date"" and now...which the day I'm posting this was supposed to be when I'd be heading up to attend the conference (a.k.a. an unnecessarily expensive excuse to spend more time with her). In the meantime we were texting back and forth, talking over the phone some nights, and we had a movie night via text. I noticed two weekends ago she was very limited in her responses and was taking hours to get back to me (which for her was common, but seemed even more so. Like a feeling or felt sense). 

I asked her over a phone call if the amount I was interacting was comfortable for her. She said ""yes"", but then asked ""are YOU okay with it"" and went on to say she didn't want my concerns to come from a place of anxiety. This is a recurring theme from her. When I would check on my speed with her (clearly I move faster) she would almost deflect from saying if I was being too much. I'd like to understand that more. I mean why wouldn't I ask? It was clear I was more talkative, starting more conversations, being the one to offer simple compliments every once in a while, and in general I just seemed more interested in getting to know her. 

Instead ,she said to not take it personally and that she just didn't like texting in general, claiming many notifications from people can make her feel overwhelmed. She said she see's the notifications from me and responds eventually, almost like I shouldn't have a problem with her texting style, but I don't have a problem with it. I was just making sure I wasn't overstepping her boundaries. Here soon you'll see why I don't think she was being honest.

So I offered an idea based on her ""dislike for texting"" and said we could basically stop texting and just have more intentional or quality phone calls/movie nights or whatever....Bad idea #3. She responded, ""I'll have to think about that"". Texted me the next morning saying that she felt there were too many expectations and that she wanted to ""take it slow"" while we ""test these waters"". Plz help me understand this since usually take it slow means no sex (fine w me) and to me ""testing the waters"" means mutually getting to know the person. I didn't want to confront her vague language at that time so I said I understood and didnt reach out the rest of that day.

Low and behold I don't text for a while, then she comes in with ""How was your day!?""  (you might sense my frustration at this point). So I responded about my day, said ""wbu?"" and sent a pic of a cool spot I was at. Then guess what....no response. I waited maybe 5 hours till like 10:30 at night, deliberated, and said ""hey u may have overlooked my 'wbu?' cuz I sent that photo after, but I hope you had a good day, ttyl!"" or something similar. She responded ""sorry!"" and gave me a clinical work up of her day and that she was busy practicing for a rehearsal the next day. 

Well the next day she hits me up in a friendly way asking if I wanted to phone chat that night. Even though she framed it as casual, I knew it wasn't gunna be good. My body was on high alert that whole day even before she reached out. The dreaded feeling in the pit of my stomach was just validated. The first hour of the call I played it cool. It was surface level bs, she was very inexpressive, oddly authoritative,  and to the point. I said well its starting to get late maybe we should end the call, she said thats ""up to me"" and then she just started unloading a host of problems and assessments she had towards me and this situation listed below:

1) I was trying to set expectations too fast. 
2) It was way too early for me to jump into this
3) She wasn't the same person anymore therefore I must be projecting.
4) I only want to be with her after I leave relationships. 
5) She said I seem to be bad at taking criticism. (I can go into the details if anyone asks in the comments)
6) Just because our bond was deep doesn't mean this is right
7) You aren't moving to my city and I'm not moving there.
8) Lastly she said the way I was handling these claims was defensive and hypervigilant, therefore that's what an argument would be like if we were together. 

There probs were a few others but these were top.

During that call it was like a whirlwind of ""holy shit she's gunna leave. This is her leaving again"". All I could scramble together in my mind was to argue that she was clearly trying to talk herself out of pursuing us and to not make this decision right now. She said she had a therapy session about it, which at this point I knew she already made her mind up. She claimed having some suggestibility but nothing I was saying was softening her defenses. Lastly at some point near the end of the call she made it her decision to end it, it seemed final. she said she felt something somatically releasing in her body, therefore confirming this was a good decision to her. 

I paused and asked if she wanted to ask me anything. she asked if I believed anything she said was accurate. I think I said ""kindof but not really. mostly feeling misinterpreted. She asked if I wanted to ask her anything. Bad idea #4: I asked if there was anything she liked that I was doing since we reconnected. She paused, dead air for about 6-8 seconds, then said ""I cant, I'm sorry"" hung up then blocked me from all social media but left SMS open.

 Feeling justified after that sucker punch, I sent some final thoughts the next morning after a sleepless night of rumination and journaling. I said it seems like she has avoidant attachment issues and that it's hard to get to know someone when there's clearly one foot out the door. She responded like it came straight from an HR dept. termination letter (i.e. Thanks for sharing this. Will inform the administrative team. Hope you find who you are looking for!)...and that was pretty much that. 

Its been nearly two weeks since our last interaction. I was in a state of heavy grief the first week. Had a therapy session and got real with myself on why jumping in wasn't good for my nervous system since I just left a bad breakup with lots of frustrations to process. Dealing with some regret on how I should've called it off until a later time and saved us from this untimely end. 

All the while knowing, based on history, she will reach out again. 

Here's what I'm taking responsibility for:
1) Letting the idea of being with her again dictate all of my major relationship decisions in life.
2) Not being honest towards my own needs for space, time, and recovery from long term relationships. I want to be single and live alone for at least a year if I'm to date anyone besides her. 6 months if she randomly hits me up and wants to try again.
3) Holding on tightly out of fear. she clearly was trying to creating space in our text communication. I wouldn't say it was textbook desperate, but I was posting more IG stories hoping she would respond, trying to impress her or catch her attention, which I normally wouldn't do. I think she picked up on that.
4) Not asking her explicitly what her def of ""taking it slow"" really meant. I mean I would've gladly stopped texting her or even cancelled our summer plans if I knew it would've made her feel safer in exploring this.  

So the big questions on my mind are these:

1) Did I fuck up the most important relationship in my life forever by not just being ""chill and mildly unavailable? lol but fr

2) To what extent is her reluctance towards me because I broke her heart in high school and does she fear I could do that again? (fun fact: she casually admitted one day that most of her best relationships ended bc she pushed people away. Was I the catalyst for that?) Also, do I fear I could break her heart again...plot twist.

3) How much DID she like us when we were together recently? for ex, she rested her head on my shoulder as we watch a yt vid together and then she said she was in like a daze, but it was a really good daze or something like that.

4) If she does reach out eventually, will I always be so forward about my strong feelings for her? I don't wanna play the game and be elusive, I just wanna be myself. I have no alluring mystery about me and wear my heart on my sleeve around her. 

5) If I wanted to be the one to try opening the door again, what's the minimum cooldown time?

6) My rent in Jan is going up significantly and the legitimate thought of moving to her city is more realistic. I would hate to make her uncomfortable if she legit wants nothing to do with me. But we've always done better when our bodies are closer. 

7) Was this a good book like I promised?? Fill me with your sweet lies :)

TL;DR
My highschool sweetheart who I could argue as my ""true love"" keeps showing back up in my life and I make very major life choices in an attempt to start again which inevitably doesn't work out and I'm stuck in an endless cycle of grief and hope. 

After spending the last month reconnecting and mutually planning some serious summer plans together, she decided to end it and blocked me on social media..but still kept SMS open?? She claimed her decision was because various concerns she assessed over the past month which she dumped on me in a single phone call, after her saying a week prior to not take her distance in texting personally and that she was comfortable with how I've been engaging (im the one that moves quicker, so I was trying to keep open comms about it)

There were many recent experiences between us that seem to tell a VERY different story than what she said on our last night. While she had some valid concerns, the vibe was that something scared her away. Imo her concerns could easily have been addressed even if it meant reconnecting after a good break in time. 

She's always going to be the one I'd choose over anyone else, so Im looking for how to best manage the power she possesses over me, potentially for the remainder of my life. Despite the no contact, I'm bracing for the next time she shows back up, or I show up in hers. It's hard to believe the story is over.

TY ❤️

Checking in on Day 15 - halfway through a month, wild. Can’t lie, part of me still expects to cave and grab a cold brew, but so far, still holding the line.

**How It's Going:**

* **Energy:** Honestly it's getting better? Not high-energy or anything wild, but I’m not walking around like a half-dead potato anymore either. Mornings are still slow but I’m getting through the day without feeling like I need a nap at 2pm. Huge improvement over last week.
* **Sleep:** Solid. Way deeper, less tossing. I used to wake up like 3-4 times a night (esp after late coffees), now I just sleep. Feels like my body’s finally doing what it’s supposed to.
* **Mood:** More chill. I'm not snapping over dumb stuff, and even when I get irritable, it passes quicker. Still get hit with random meh-feels, but not as dramatic.

**Cravings:** Still pop up, especially when I smell coffee. Walked past a café today and legit paused like an ex just texted me. But I didn’t go in. Just kept walking. That little NOCAF app reminder about to maintain streak much $$ and time I’ve saved? Kind of a lifesaver in those moments ngl.

**What’s Helped So Far:**

* **Hydration**, obv.
* I’ve been tracking each day on the app - simple check mark system, nothing fancy. But seeing that streak makes it feel like I’m not starting from zero every morning plus it's great to see other's journey on it is encouraging. Discipline's a muscle I guess?
* Daily movement - like even a 15 min walk or a stretch sesh when I’m foggy helps more than I thought.
* Also journaling now and then when I’m having a rough patch, just to vent it out instead of spiraling.

**Random Realization:**

I used to need caffeine to feel ""switched on."" Now I'm kinda learning how to function at my own pace -slower, sure, but steadier? It’s weirdly empowering.

Still miss the ritual tho. The whole cozy mug, the buzz, the illusion of control. But I don’t miss feeling wired, anxious, or that gross dependency vibe.

Anyway — if you're on Day 1, 3, whatever - keep pushing. The fog *does* start to lift. Not all at once, but little by little. And if I can get through 15 days (me?!), you def can too.

Stay hydrated, stay human!
