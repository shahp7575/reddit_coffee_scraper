1om4a16,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1om4a16/the_internet_is_easy_to_quit_when_you_know/,The internet is easy to quit when you know yourself,"I apologize for the long post. I've been a long time lurker of this sub. Yet I haven't really seen a post discussing how to use the internet less from the standpoint of actually realizing what you like. I plan on deleting my account after this post. For some background reference I'm an older Gen Z practically grew up with the internet. In college I deleted instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and Snapchat. People who say this won't have an effect on your social life are both right and completely delusional. My friends constantly wanted to share memes with me, girlfriends wanted to share post/memes with me, and any sort of club or fraternity event was arranged in snapchat. I lost access to all of these. Now it helped that I saw all these people in real life everyday basically but it was just assumed that you knew what was going down or going on since it was posted in the group chat. You will experience some sort of backlash or outcast feeling. It only makes sense. These people in your life have a way of communicating and you've completed remove yourself from that form of communication. It's the equivalent of always going for coffee with friends. Only to one day quit drinking coffee. You'll still go hangout but it feels odd at first. This will subside after a while as people will generally accept your decision and adjust accordingly. These are the easy social medias to quit. The biggest benefit I have found isn't less time being wasted because you'll just replace it. Which I'll explain in a second. The biggest benefit is asking someone to take a picture with you and they know you're doing it because you want that picture of you together. Not to post, not for likes, not to show off. You just genuinely want a picture with them. When you chat with people the conversations won't be random memes or jokes. You'll choose to stay in contact with them. You'll call them and actually catch up. For all of college, my high school friend and I called each other and caught up at the minimum of once a month. We were across the country from each other, on different timezones. Also if you meet someone and they say it's a red flag not to have social media. Then you know you probably don't vibe with that person. This is the first step of recognizing who you are and what your likes/interest are.

The hardest social media to quit is reddit, YouTube, and discord. Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, etc...You know they're bad for you and a time waster due to the algorithm. But you leave reddit, YouTube, and discord out because 'it's differnet'. You'll waste time on these sites instead. People will say its educational, beneficial, learning, etc...While this can be true. Most of the content you're probably watching is entertainment. The way to quit these is by realizing what do you actually like being entertained by. I think this is only way to truly accept the internet for what it is. A tool. If you try to go the route of hate such as 'all these stupid people take photos at the bar. They're so dumb', 'these people just scroll all day and are probably so unhappy', or 'I'm trying to better myself and improve so I can be so much better then these people'. This will only work temporarily and won't solve your problem. Your problem isn't the internet. You're probably just a dick. Go to therapy or something. 

Now let's talk about being entertained. Ask yourself why you watch what you watch. I can tell you why I got more into reddit recently. I watched a bunch of shows that dealt with some cool philosophical/psychological stuff. I got really invested and wanted more of those themes/stuff. So I thought I would join reddit groups. At first it felt great because it felt like I knew people in the community and maybe I was gonna unlock some new information on these themes. After a while I realized it was some great fan art, people asking basic questions for the show, or in general memes. This is extremely disappointing. I find that reddit is this in a nutshell. You won't unlock some new knowledge, it's pretty surface level, people venting, fanart/memes. Why are you even here on this sub. There's plenty of people on here who say they only use this sub. Why? What entertainment do you get from this? When you realize what you actually want to be entertained by or learn about something. It becomes so easy to quit these internet platforms because they don't fulfill the need. You wanna learn about coding. You would do better reading a book on coding and taking a class then you ever would on reddit. Reddit is just the least resistant option. But when you realize it's not the right tool you'll find it pointless. Even if it's easier to access, it's not accessing what you want. 

This goes for YouTube especially. YouTubers won't ever be like tv or movies because they can't end. A TV show might run for a long time but it can choose to end. Those writers, directors, actors, editors, producers, etc...Will go on to get other jobs on other shows or movies. YouTubers can't do that. They found a niche. They will grind that niche. This causes a lot of them to be very repetitive. Take a second and ask what you like about these YouTubers. Do they fill a void or add something. If they fill a void thats not entertainment thats cope. If they add something then great! A personal example being funny gaming moments YouTubers. Loved them as a teen and stopped watching. During a lonely period in my life I began to rewatch them as they're extremely popular still posting. I didn't find them funny but I was lacking friends at this time. They filled that void. Then I realized I didn't want entertainment in laughs, I wanted entertainment in laughing with actual friends. You have to recognize this. Once I realized what I truly wanted to be entertained by. I couldn't care less about those gaming YouTubers anymore. You watch science videos? Hour long explanation of things? Do you actually care. This is a random person on the internet. Who probably is just relaying stuff they found online or in a book. So why not just go find the book. Why do you watch movies or gaming or book reviews? Just go watch the thing. Save up the money. Play the game. How many times has someone shit on something you like. A YouTube reviewer is no different. You wanna be entertained so go pick the actual entertainment you want. If you want to really cut back. I personally disabled watch history removing the front page, subscribed to channels I genuinely get entrainment from that I treat like tv shows. I then only watch YouTube on Sundays. These channels don't post 24/7 so it's pretty easy to binge all of them for two hours. 

Discord is the same way but worse. I joined a bunch of discords looking for more people like me who enjoyed those shows. Lowkey it just isn't fun. I feel fucking weird in those discords. One person is a freshman college venting about life. Only for a a mid 30s woman to give life advice in the chat. I don't wanna fucking be here. it slowly can turn into reddit where you just scroll from what people chat but you just feel like a leech. You don't know these people or care. So why are you here? Because you liked the same show and characters? You liked those characters not the people who also like them. They're not the same. 

In the end all these sites are for entertainment. If you realize what you actually want out of them you can easily quit. It'll will take sometime realizing they aren't real or don't provide what you're looking for. When was the last time you actually asked yourself what you find entertaining. You also need to define entertainment. Entertainment isn't always easy. I find playing sports is entertaining but they're also very hard and exhausting. So don't confuse entertainment with ease. 

I don't think you have to quit these sites if you don't want to. Just sit down with yourself for once and ask why you watch or read these things. Is it cause of some underlying problem that could be addressed a different way. It's not all about self improvement, being better than people, or thinking you found a utopia outside. Real life sucks a lot. Really bad. You should be allowed to be entertained. So choose the entertainment you actually want. Only you can figure it out. There's no rainbow on the other side. You won't wake up a better person for not using these things. You're not unique. You're not different. That should have never been the goal in the first. The goal should be that you want to try and have an enjoyable life. You just need to figure out what you actually enjoy. Once you figure that out. These sites and users become meaningless. This is a good first step. ",1,1762045216.0,nosurf,1,1.0,False

He was always a work-oriented guy, and I figured he was a cold father when I was a child. Now fast forward to mid July, he was laid off. And at first, he seemed fine, he was doing interviews every single day. But as of recently, he wakes up at noon, buys a large coffee everyday, and then he either is on his phone, at the mosque every prayer time, or praying at home (at least that's what I see, but I'm often at uni, visiting ever so often). I think he's just the stoic type, and he internalises all his pain, even if my whole family knows it hurts him, as he used to lock in to work, but he's not as youthful and energetic as he once was (47).  
  
I figured it was just some well needed rest, but it's turning into November and I'm concerned. My mother is too, and she tends to either face problems head on, rather than with finesse, or ignores it, which is what she's been doing right now, since she doesn't want to push too hard. Our relationship isn't rocky, but I grew up kind of distant from him because he was always so busy with work and I was bitter as a kid. I'm also not a very affectionate person, but I do deeply worry for him, because he might dig himself into a ditch that he can't climb out of. I don't know how to break the ice or if I'll push him too hard trying to help him, or even how to bring it up, because he's the authority figure, y'know? I figure he might just act tough and pretend nothing's wrong.  
  
Is there something I could do to help? Am I overreacting? (Also sorry guys for all the bloat and mess, I kind of just put it there for context, but maybe I put too much or it's too disorganized)",1,1762045188.0,depression_help,1,1.0,False
1om484z,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1om484z/the_beast_in_the_pines_part_1/,"The Beast In The Pines, Part 1","My mom and dad were born and raised in Clarence, an old small town in the countryside between the midlands and the coast. A flat woodland, lush from its snaking rivers and creeks. Its swamps bled into the marshes and down through the deltas into the salty southern coast that was a little over an hour away. Clarence was the little nothing-town people passed when they drove down to the beach for vacation. 

My grandparents, Nanny and Papa, owned a pine tree farm in Clarence. 100 acres, and 75 of those acres were rows upon rows of loblolly pine trees. They lived on the property in a small farmhouse at the end of a long dirt driveway. It was small, and while it may have been nearly prehistoric, it never felt creepy. It felt like a cozy respite, a home away from home; sitting like an island in the middle of a large yard dotted with gnarled towering oak, walnut, and pecan trees. There were rickety barns as old as the dirt they sat on. Sprawling garden beds with herbs, flowers and vegetables. Wooden arbors overgrown with pluming heaps of muscadine grape vines. All acting as a buffer for the pine rows that surrounded the house on three sides. 

The remaining 20-or-so acres behind the pine rows were dense woods, cut down the middle by a winding trail that lead to the river. Nanny and Papa had clear-cut those 75 acres and planted the pines about 10 years prior. Papa passed away when I was small, and Nanny wasn’t far behind him, passing a few years later.

We inherited their cherished little farmhouse and pine tree farm.

We couldn’t live at the farm, of course. My Dad already had a job, and nobody gets a weekly paycheck to watch pine trees grow. So while adding the upkeep of a farm would be a heavy burden on top of a 9-5 work week, it was a labor of love that my parents were used to. Before Nanny passed, we would come down to Clarence to visit her every other weekend, giving her a hand with house work and yard work- especially as she got older. In the spring and summer it was more like every weekend, a constant battle for my Dad to keep the vegetation from taking over.

Despite how exhausting it sounded, my busy-body parents enjoyed it. The farm was a way of staying near their family and friends, all while enjoying the rural lifestyle of their hometown again. Getting themselves and their only daughter away from the buzz of suburbia.

At the time of this story, the pines were somewhere between 12-15ft tall. Nanny had passed away in October and we didn’t return until spring that next year. It was the mid 90s, and I was 8 years old. 

We left home that March on a Friday afternoon and head down the interstate towards Clarence and our pine tree farm, a routine that we knew well. It was a 45 or-so minute drive, and once we pulled into town and got situated, Dad would stay at the house and start on yard-work. Mom and I would go to the grocery store, getting enough food to last us until we left Sunday afternoon.

The only grocery store in Clarence was the old Piggly Wiggly. I distinctly remember the sweet wrinkled smiles of its employees and the smell of cigarettes that hung in the air. 

Mom and I stood in the checkout line.

“Oh shi- shoot! Oh shoot! Honey I forgot the bread, can you run and grab one for me real quick?”

I gave her a chirpy “yes ma’am” and moved swiftly towards the bread aisle. I skirted to a stop when I realized there was a small display right there by checkout. A table laid out with checkerboard table cloth, loaves carefully placed in circular tiers. I snatched up a loaf, brought it to my mom and we headed home. 

We drove back to the farmhouse in my Mom’s station wagon, a new single by Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers was on the radio. Anticipation began to build as I stared eagerly out the window, in childish awe of the countryside’s vast emerging greenery.

We turned off of the road, patches of field on either side of the long dirt driveway leading up to the farmhouse, which sat at the end like a lady. A sweet, modest, classy thing, built in 1903. She was stark white, laced with gingerbread trim. Full, blossoming azalea bushes hemmed the wide front porch like a skirt, all of her topped off with an evergreen tin roof that sang me to sleep in the rain.

My mom backed her station wagon up to the front porch and I helped her as we began to take in groceries. 

We heard him coming before we saw him. A humming engine sang over a chorus of baying hounds. 

It was Mr. Voss, our neighbor. His hunting beagles running spiritedly behind his ATV, a howling snarling cloud of dust tearing down the road before turning into our driveway.

My Dad pulled up beside us in his creaky old brown work truck, that I had affectionately named “Bear,” when I was small. Because it was brown, and it growled. 

Dad hopped out. He ruffled my hair, and gave my mom a kiss on the cheek.

“Hey squirt. Hey honey, Dan called- said we needed to talk.”

“Everything okay?”

“I guess we’ll find out. Hope so. Need any help with those groceries?”

“No, no, I’ve got my sidekick here helping me, you invite Dan inside and I’ll bring you boys something to drink.”

Dad gave me a wink and a pat on the back before he walked up to greet Mr. Voss who had pulled up and cut the power on his ATV, his dogs gallivanting off to play and sniff around. My dad always looked so big and strong to me, but next to Mr Voss he looked small. I heard the frame creak as he dismounted his machine. 

Daniel Voss was Clarence’s nearly retired fire chief, and when he wasn’t in uniform he was in camo. He shook Dad’s hand with a pursed smile under his mustache, and nodded towards my mother and me.

“Mrs Willis, little Miss Willis,” 

He directed his attention back to my dad. “Thanks for letting me stop by, Peter.”

“Hey, no problem man. Everything alright? You sounded serious over the phone.”

My mom took the last bag of groceries and shooed me off to play. I was old enough to understand that the adults were talking and I needed to scadaddle. However, I was also a talented eavesdropper, as most children are. I ran along the side of the house, sneaking in through the back door. I found a nice hiding spot behind a small wooden bench in the hallway. There was a mirror on the wall, giving me a peak into the living room where Dad knelt striking a match in the fireplace, while Mr. Voss made comments about the weather and the sitting president. 

After Mom had put away the groceries she joined them with a handful of empty glasses. She grabbed a bottle of whisky from the top of the china cabinet and poured them all a shot of the syrupy golden spirit. Mr Voss sat in the tattered plaid wingback by the fireplace, a small modest flame beginning to crackle in its hearth. He laced and re-laced his fingers, as if he was somewhat apprehensive to begin the conversation until suddenly he cleared his throat.

“So Peter, Lori, I know y’all just rolled into town, but I had to fill you folks in on what’s been going on around here lately. It’s a matter of safety, especially with yer little youngin’ running around.”

I always thought it was such a shame that Mr Voss chewed tobacco all the time. Not only because I thought spitting dip was gross, but because it prevented him from speaking as much. Mr Voss sounded like the lowest string on a fiddle, his vocal chords oiled with old southern blood. A lullaby with seamless rises and dips in cadence, every sentence a resonant stanza in a ballad. He would recall a trip to the post office to the tune of an old campfire story. 

That early evening in March, as dusk and its chill fell upon the treetops of Clarence and the sun sank low in a peach colored sky, I noticed that Mr Voss’ speech was unobscured by his usual lip full of dip. 

I settled into my hiding spot. This must be serious. Mr Voss was about to spin a yarn.

“So, all of this started in late November, best we can all surmise. Rumors began floating around right after Thanksgiving. Late November, 'ya know, 'ya had boys out there on their land or their buddy’s land hunting deer and ducks, doves and geese. Fat and happy in their camo, believe me I was one of ‘em. But a few of ‘em made some grizzly discoveries. They, uh, found some animal carcasses while they were huntin’.” 

The puzzled looks on my parents faces were suddenly imbued with concern. Mr Voss took a sip of his whisky and continued, 

“As I’m sure you both know, eastwards, right yander across the river from your property is Ed Kerry’s huntin’ land. He’s got about 50 acres or thereabouts. Well, Kerry and his boys were huntin’ in the wee hours of the morning, planning on shacking up in a little hunting stand near a clearing in the center of the property. Once they got up there and started lookin’ around, they found a buck-”

His voice cracked for a moment as his eyes flickered between Mom and Dad. 

“-a mutilated buck… At first, they thought it was a pack of coyotes, maybe a bobcat. But the more they saw, the harder it was to rationalize in their minds. Now Peter, Lori, I don’t mean to be graphic, but I think it’s important that you know the details.” 

He paused, waiting for one of them to stop him, but neither did. 

“It was fresh. The neck was broken, violently. It had been ‘eviscerated’ as one of Kerry’s boys put it. Ed said it was a mess, carnage just- everywhere. Something had taken a bite through its leg at the haunches, cracked right through the bones, and crushed the socket when it ripped it out. Ed said the bite was this big,”

He gestured, but from outside of my peeping-mirror’s view.

My Dad exhaled in disbelief.

My mom winced, a pained look on her face.

“My God, Dan.”

“By December’s end they had found that buck, and a few more animals torn up to a similar degree. The week before Christmas, I was in the field near the border of your property, and I saw a lump of fur layin' off yander in the field. I was worried it was one of my beagles. But once I got up close to it I saw it was a coyote. There were these deep gashes, from the tips of the ribs on one side to the tips of the ribs on the other. I could see the oval shape of the bite mark, it had a set of jaws- I mean a big set jaws, like Ed had said. Must’ve just held its ribcage in its mouth and bitten down on it.”

 Mr Voss paused, lost in thought for a moment.

“Peter I’ve never seen anything like it. It was a nightmare, I’m just glad the wife didn’t stumble on it.”

Mr Voss downed what was left of his whisky. I heard the clink of his glass as he sat it on coffee table. 

“Then, about 2 weeks later David Kilpatrick and his daughter were out huntin’ on Kerry’s land. 'Ya know Kerry’s boy, Joey, been sweet on her for a while, so Kerry lets Dave take her out there huntin’. Give Joey something to bond with her over and all that. Well, the little lady bags her a doe, so her and Dave head over to it, trudging through all the brush and fallen leaves and what have 'ya to tag it. As they’re walking over, girl goes to hop over this recently fallen sweet gum tree. That poor child landed in a dead buck’s corpse. It was almost all skeleton, but fallin into a leathery cracked-open rib cage shakes her up pretty good. Dave said that its head was all gnawed up with big ol’ teeth marks, and the antlers were crunched. Now I don’t know about you but I’ve never heard of a bite that’d crunch antlers on a deer like that.”

My dad shook his head, staring off in a daze. “No, never.”

“Well, then Neal found another coyote, said it looked just like the one on my property. But who knows, it could’ve been skinned alive and split in half and Neal wouldn’t mention it. You know Neal, you could tie him to the railroad tracks and he’d barely mumble about it. Last thing I’d heard was a week ago when Bill found a doe. He was near the border of your property, said he’d been fixing a fence post earlier that day and left his pack of smokes out there. So he hopped in his truck in his pajamas that night and went back to fetch 'em. The same fence post he’d fixed was broken again, and not 10 feet from it was a doe. She’d been ripped apart at the rib cage. Bill said it looked like a damn frog dissection from high school.”

All of them were silent for a long moment, the only sound the crackling in the fireplace.

Dad spoke up, “What is everybody thinking? A bear?”

I heard Mr Voss sniff, as he nodded. “Bear. Maybe a big wolf.”

“I’ve heard of bear wandering down this far south occasionally, but a wolf? I don’t know…”

Mr Voss inclined his hand toward the the whisky bottle on the table, Dad encouraged him to help himself, so Mr Voss poured everyone another finger.

“A bear, a wolf, whatever it is- it’s a devil. The damage it does is just- gruesome.” 

“Nobody's found any tracks?”

“Not in the leaves. You know how it is this time of year. You’re practically wading through ‘em.”

Mr Voss sighed as he fiddled with the glass, so small in his hands.

“But I wanted to catch you as soon as you arrived, Peter, and I know I don’t need to spell this out for you, yer a smart fella. But we’re finding bodies north, south, east and west of here, and l’m not trying to alarm you folks but- I think you know as well as I do that you might have some dead animals on your property.”

At that I decided to make my exit, sneaking away from my hiding spot. I figured I would need to be in position when Mom or Dad came to tell me about my inevitable new ground rules. 

I ran off to the squatty structure near the back of the house, what my Nanny had called “The Kitty Cat Barn.” It was a dilapidated flat-roof barn, enlaced with morning glories that crawled through the rusted rotting holes in its ancient metal siding. It seems to have once been a small barn for a couple of work animals like donkeys or small horses, but Papa had put shelves up and Nanny just used it to store her preserves. However as she and Papa got older, they garnered a large collection of stray cats, as the sweet and elderly have a habit of doing. So near the end of their life, they gave away all their preserves to their kids and their friends from church and stocked the shelves instead with baskets and boxes, lined with soft old towels and worn rags. Setting out a couple dozen of little bowls for them to eat from. When we weren’t there, one of our neighbors, Mrs. Kerry, gladly came out and fed them for us in exchange for herbs from the garden, though she rarely ever took any. 

I squatted on the dirt floor of the barn. It wasn’t long before a handful of kittens clumsily wandered out to investigate my presence. Moments later, what I assumed was their mother, came over and began nuzzling up against me. I rubbed gently behind her velvety ears before walking out of the barn. I made sounds gesturing for the kittens to come out into the grass to play, but their mood shifted and they would not come. They only stood in the doorway beside their mother, watching me. I scoffed. Cats.

Not a moment later, Mom came over, asking if we could talk. We sat on one of the steps of the back door stoop. She gave me a frank but watered down version of Mr. Voss’s story, then laid down the law. 

 “No playing in the pine rows, and no going outside for any reason after sunset. If you see something, anything, out of the ordinary- come tell myself or your father, immediately. Are we clear?”

“Yes ma’am.”

She asked if knew what to do if I was approached by a bear or a wolf, and I prattled off the steps to her. Don’t run. Back away slowly. If it approaches you, try to make yourself look big. All that. I can tell this relaxed her a bit, and she told me to have fun playing, and to be careful. 

The rest of the day was as pleasant as any day when you were 8. I ran aimlessly all over the yard, not much different from Mr Voss’s beagles. I stopped by the arbor to pick muscadine grapes. I helped Mom do some work in the flower beds, and before I knew it it was time to come inside. She threw a Disney movie into the small tube television in my room while she worked in the kitchen. Dad came in and washed up from doing yard work all day, the farmhouse’s old pipes groaning as he showered. We had dinner that night, I can’t recall what it was, but it was warm and I went back for seconds. After Dad and I cleaned the kitchen for Mom, we all sat at on the floor of the living room, playing Old Maid and talking by the fire. As the evening drew to a close, we all started getting ready for bed. 

That was the first night I saw the beast.

I remember it well. 

After I had given Dad a kiss and told him goodnight, Mom tucked me into bed under the fresh linens she had put on earlier that afternoon. She kissed my head reminding me to say my prayers before turning off the lights and closing the door, bidding me goodnight. 

Prayers said, I waited for sleep to overcome me but it never did. I tossed and turned for a while, before quietly sliding out of bed and slinking over to my window. The cats would always come out at night, and the view from outside of my bedroom window happened to be a particularly high traffic cat crossing. 

There were bushes beneath my window, and looking past them you could see paths that wound between and around garden beds brimming with various flowers and herbs. Behind them was the smallest of the barns that adorned the yard, Nanny had used it for storing gardening equipment and potting soil. It may have been geriatric, but it was a sturdy structure. It had survived an oak falling on it a couple years before and still stood tall. Behind it was a small stretch of field, and then the sea of pine rows.

I peered out of the antique, single pane glass. Keeping my breaths shallow as to not fog it up. I searched the shadows for cats, when my eye caught something in the distance. Deer occasionally appeared during these midnight matinees, strolling in the field or leaping through the pine rows. 

But this shape wasn’t moving like that.

The more I focused in on it, the more I saw that it was larger than I had thought. Larger than a deer. My sleepy brain began to dial in, seemingly aware that this was something outside of our routine viewing. I concentrated on the shape, holding my breath so as to ease my face as close to the glass as possible.

It prowled beneath the branches, its spine arched, its limbs creeping like a spider. Slow, deliberate movements, its ashen form lurked in the dark obscurity of the pine rows. It horrified me to think that if I hadn’t been deliberately looking at it, I could have cast a glance out the window and not even noticed it. 

Being that I was child, I did what any child might do. In my horror, I hyperventilated and broke into tears. I went running into my parents’ room. Desperate and pitiful, trying to explain to them what I saw. Mom was quick to fall into her maternal instincts, holding me close, wiping away my tears and stroking my hair. My Dad rubbed my back to comfort me, but his mind had gone back to the discussion with Mr Voss. 

“Did you see its face honey? Did it look like a bear?”

I quickly shook my head, eyes still wet with tears. 

“No- no it wasn’t a bear. It was too… too tall and long. A- a bear would be… less- gangly. This wasn’t. And it didn’t have any fur. It was-”

The more I thought back on the beast the more scared I became, all over again, until I burst into tears. I buried my face into my mother’s shoulder.

“It was so awful,” I sobbed, 

“I just want it to never come back.” 

My parents exchanged sympathetic looks. I slept in bed with them that night.

The next day was business as usual. In the morning after breakfast I helped Mom with some chores and then was released into the yard to play. I rode my bike up and down the dirt driveway while I listened to my Walkman. Mom watched me from the front porch while she mended some of Dad’s overalls. After a while she called me to help her again in the garden. We watered and weeded until it was time for lunch. Mom made grilled cheese and tomato soup. Dad came in, just having finished weed-eating, so he was a little dirty and peppered with blades of grass. We talked and ate and joked around. It wasn’t until Mom and I were doing the dishes that I noticed that Dad had vanished.

“Where’s Dad?” I asked, a little incredulously, at the absence of my dishwashing partner.

Mom’s eyes never left her work as she spoke, 

“He’s meeting Mr Voss.”

“Why?”

“Just to check out the Pine Rows”

She said nonchalantly. I didn’t press her about it, I knew they were out searching for dead animals.

Dad didn’t return until it was nearly dinner time. He didn’t say hey, he didn’t go to the kitchen for something to drink, he went straight to the shower. I could hear the pipes from my bedroom. During dinner, Dad seemed tired, but he put on a tired smile, asking me about my day and what all Mom and I had been up to. I had a feeling he didn’t want me to ask about his day, so I blabbed about everything Mom and I had done, how the cats were acting, and the songs I listened to on my Walkman. After we ate, I asked if I could go watch a movie in my room until lights out. My parents eagerly obliged. 

I sat cross legged on my bed, pretending to watch the Black Cauldron, I saw Dad pass my bedroom door. I tiptoed over, peaking my head out, watching him make his way wearily through the house and out to the front porch. I heard the pipes creak and knew Mom would be joining him shortly. 

Sensing an interesting conversation on the horizon, I took up a hiding spot near a coat rack by the front door, with a great view out the window and onto the front porch. I watched as Dad fell back into a rocking chair, exhausted. He packed and lit his briar pipe. The sky bore pearly hues of blush and lilac as it laid the day to rest. Dad leaned back, the embers in his pipe akin to the glow of the sunset as he took a long deep pull, exhaling a swirling plume of smoke.

I ducked down as Mom walked by. Her skin still rosey from her hot shower. Her hair was thrown up in a bun, and all her makeup was off. But she was more beautiful than the dusk sky, and Dad’s eyes corroborated my opinion. 

She met his gaze with a gentle smile, joining him in an adjacent rocking chair with a glass of wine in one hand and a beer in another. 

“I saw your bloody jeans in the hamper. I assume you had a 'work boots' kind of day.” She said with a weak laugh.

Dad scoffed. Mom always teased him for wearing the same pair of very-off-white New Balances all the time. She used to make comments to me on the days she saw them sitting by the back door, saying that he must be out doing dirty work. 

“You and Dan found an animal out there today?”

“Multiple.” Dad replied, his pipe hanging from the corner of his mouth as he cracked open his beer. 

“Two deer, a coyote, and a bobcat. We buried one of the deer and the bobcat. The rest of them were decayed enough or out of the way enough that we said ‘to hell with it.’”

Mom pensively said nothing.

“Dan called his game warden buddy, kind of a jack-ass, in my opinion. He told us to get photographic evidence. So Dan snapped some photos, said he’s gonna get ‘em developed tomorrow afternoon.”

The were a few lingering moments of silence until Mom spoke, asking softly,  

“What had happened to them?”

I heard Dad’s pipe clack between his teeth after taking another pull. By then the woody aroma had drifted into the house from under the front door. The smell of his tobacco was earthy, rich and sweet. He paused, taking a swig of his beer before answering. 

“A few of the deer seemed to have recently rotted down to their skeletons. Lots of their bones were broken, so we couldn’t quite put together what had happened to them; and ya’ know the vultures had probably gotten to ‘em and moved stuff around too. The coyote carcass was maybe a month old, it looked something had put a bunch of weight down on its ribs and crushed it. The bobcat-“

Dad stopped for a moment, as if remembering in awe.

“The bobcat was fresh Lori, real fresh. Past 24 hours fresh.”

“Oh my God, Peter.”

“It was a big one too. We found it at the base of a black walnut tree. It looked like it’s spine had been snapped against the trunk, and then something just-“ dad gestured with his hands, digging at the air. Sparing the gory details.

“All the blood on my clothes was from the Bobcat.”

“Well, thank God we didn’t let Amy play in the pine rows yesterday, how far was it from the house?”

“It was near the back of the rows, towards the woods. After we found and buried it we decided to call it quits for the day, but we’ll finish tomorrow, Dan said he’d help me.”

“Finish?”

“Yeah, we only got halfway around the pines, Lori. We still have to look around the other half tomorrow.”

The quiet returned for a few moments. Hanging in the air with the smoke from Dad’s pipe.

“Lori, don’t let Amy out of your sight.” I saw Mom nodding her head.

“I’m gonna keep the Benelli by the back door, it’s the semi-automatic, I remember you said you felt comfortable with that one. And I’m gonna keep the thirty-thirty, the Marlin, by the front door. I doubt it would just come up to the house in broad daylight, but I want you to be prepared in case I’m not here at the house with you.”

“That’s a good idea. And I think when Amy plays outside I need to tell her to stay in view of the windows. So you or I can see her.”

“Okay, good thinking. And we’ll need to ask her not to have her Walkman on her ears while she’s out there. I don’t want something sneaking up on her.”

Mom scoffed, “She’s not gonna like that.”

“Nah, she’s smart. If we explain it to her I’m sure she’ll understand.”

I didn’t like that. 

But I knew as well as they did that I would, in all likelihood, comply. Mom and Dad were reasonable, so I usually did.

“I know this is all scary for her- shit, it’s scary for all of us.”

“What the hell do you think this thing is Peter?”

 Dad let out a long exasperated sigh, as though he’d been asking himself that very thing all day. “The best thing I can figure is a bear. A very, very large bear. But who knows, I mean, we looked, but we didn’t see any tracks or scat or anything.”

“There were no tracks near the path? Even near the bobcat?”

Dad shook his head, “Too many pine needles. I mean years and years worth. We saw indentions in the earth under them, but nothing we could decipher.”

Dad finished his beer, setting it down on the ground by his rocking chair.

“Tomorrow, Dan’s gonna help me check the second half of the pine rows. He said one day next week he could send his nephews out on their four wheelers to check the woods that back up to the river.”

“Oh gosh is that safe?”

“It’s been a few years but those little rascals are grown, they’re young men now, they’re almost as tall as Dan.”

Mom hummed, not convinced, but opting to move on. “That’s nice of Dan to help you.”

“Yeah, he didn’t ask for anything but I told him I’d throw him and his nephews some cash for the help. I wish I could say I was hopeful, but I worry what those boys might find out there.”

I heard one of their rocking chairs creak as they moved to stand up, so I quietly scurried back off to my room. My parents didn’t bring it up to me that night or ever, didn’t say anything about it at all. Likely fearful that I would have another “nightmare.”

The last day, Sunday afternoon, Mom and I did the laundry and packed our things. The packing didn’t take long. We left most of our stuff behind, seeing that we would be back next weekend. Once I had my little red and white polka dot duffle bag tucked in the trunk of her station wagon Mom told me I could play until we left in a couple of hours. I climbed my favorite tree, an oak near the back door that Dad had nailed wooden steps onto. Mom sat outside with me, folding laundry. I finished my Goosebumps book, so I examined my pockets and discovered a long screw. Lord know where I’d found it or why I’d picked it up but I decided it was time to carve my initials into a tree. 

Mom and I both heard the phone in the house ring, so she hopped up to get it. Probably Aunt Cheryl. She had been meaning to stop by that weekend but Mom had told her it wasn’t a great time. While carving an “A” from way up in the tree I saw Dad coming over from the shop barn. It was the largest of the barns, and Papa had used it as a workshop. From the shade of the enormous oak beside the barn, it looked like Dad had grabbed a rag, using it to wipe something on his shirt. As he stepped out into the light I could see that it was blood. Red, fresh.

Dad didn’t see me in the tree, so he didn't put on any heirs. He pulled his baseball cap off and wiped the sweat on his forehead with his arm. For a busy-body who normally took such long purposeful strides, his steps were slow. Heavy. His face was so white. His eyes were locked onto the ground in front of him as he walked. My dad looked scared. 

Mom tried to covertly put his dirty clothes in a bag while Dad showered and got changed. I didn’t say anything. Dad didn’t know I’d seen him, and Mom thought I was none the wiser. We turned off all the lights, locked all the doors, and then hit the road for home. Looking out my window at the lush greenery of the countryside that had so enamored me only days before, I couldn’t help but think now that it only acted as a shroud, a living, flowering veil that hid the beast lurking within. 

Back at home in the sardine can of suburbia, any moment absent of conscious thought was overcome with visions of the beast. If I had been any older, it would have been an easy write off, “its just a nightmare,” “you’re crazy,” “go see a psychologist;” but I wasn’t. I was an 8 year old little girl who read mythology encyclopedias and fairy tale compendiums like I was going for a PhD. I actively side stepped mushroom rings for fear of being kidnapped by the fae. A small piece of every Little Debbie cake I got was left near the crawl space door in case we had hobgoblins or brownies living under our house (which at the time, I seriously suspected we did).

My parents, the logic-bound adults could chock it all up to a subconscious presentation of a fear response, but I didn’t want to lie to myself.

I knew what I saw. 

As harrowing as it was, I kept mulling it over in my mind. Turning it over, rotating it at different angles, all in hopes of better understanding what it really was- the devil outside my bedroom window. If I was acting spacey, my friends at school didn’t say anything, at least not to my face. In the hallway, at lunch, at P.E. It possessed my every thought. 

The list of things I didn’t know about it was infinite, so I started with what I did know about it. 

It was large. Tall. I tried to think of it in comparison to the pines, and in doing so I stumbled upon a memory. It was a year before Nanny died, I was small, but not small enough to forget. It was the last time she was able to walk the pine rows with me. Her hair was as white as her sweet little farmhouse, and her bones burled and bent with age. Her voice was as gentle as the rustle in the pine needles. She said that because the pines were all planted so close together, the lowest of the branches wouldn’t get enough sunlight. As a result, they would drop off while the higher branches would reach upwards to take in more sunlight. I remember her smiling, as if that fact meant something to her.

She said that Papa had measured, and most of the branches in the pine rows were 5-7 feet from the ground. 

With that information at my disposal. I did some guesswork, but my safe guess was that it had been at least 4 feet, or probably more like 5 feet tall, on all fours.

It’s torso and appendages were lean. Not stocky, like a bear’s. Bears weren’t built that way. Why was I still thinking about bears? It definitely wasn’t a bear. What features I did see resembled a wolf, but wolves weren’t that large, that hairless, or that lanky. Neither were bears. My head began to throb. Whatever small annoying part of my brain had started developing was trying desperately to compare it to what I knew to be real. Thankfully the rest of my mind was fantastical and thought mermaids existed, so instead of having a psychological breakdown like an adult, I came to grips with the fact that this beast was a wolf-like and in all likelihood a werewolf. But I needed to do some research.  

That day after school, I asked Mom to take me to the library, a request she was used to. On the car ride there, she asked me what kind of book I was going to look for. So I explained my werewolf theory to her. A decision I immediately regretted when I saw the pity and concern within her eyes in the rear view mirror. 

“Honey, I know we’ve talked about all of this with the fairies and the mermaids and the unicorns, but werewolves aren’t real honey. I love that you have such a vivid imagination, but you’ve got to be realistic. I mean, sure, it might have been that bear or wolf out in the woods, but it was probably just a nightmare-“

“It couldn’t be a nightmare, I was at the window, and I know what I saw! It wasn’t normal looking- It didn’t look like a bear or a wolf, it was something else. I’m 100% sure that I saw what I saw! Mom, I swear- I swear I’m not lying.”

I saw the pained deliberation in her eyes. Outside of my fascination and proclivity for fairy stories I was pretty practical for my age. I listened to Mom and Dad when they told me things, I was forthcoming and honest if I did something I wasn’t supposed to. I wouldn’t blatantly lie to my Mom, and she knew that.

“Well, then, baby… if you really did see what you think you saw then- well, then it must have been a nightmare. And you’ve slept walked before! You know you were probably just sleep walking, had a nightmare, and woke at the window.”

My brow furrowed, taking what my mom said into consideration but not able to convince myself. I stared out the window in deep thought until we pulled up to the library.

Once we arrived, I didn’t have to worry about trying to give my Mom the slip. My love of books and stories came from her, and she made a B-line for the mystery section. Despite her dismissal of my werewolf theory, she loved spooky stories. 

  After collecting a few books from the sections labeled “folklore” and “nature science,” I found an empty table and started to read. I skimmed through a couple of books on mythology and American folklore and the like, none of its pages revealing any groundbreaking revelations. Silver bullets, transformation under the light of the moon, all the usual factoids. What was highly informative, however, was the expository book on wolves. 

How fast they were, how much power and stamina they possessed, how strong their bite was, how sharp their eyes were, how keen their sense of smell was; all the things that made them great hunters. I kept in mind that this was all a baseline for this creature. At the very least it did all these things. The thought overcame me with dread. I didn’t exactly calculate the metrics, but I knew that this monster likely doubled if not tripled anything a wolf could do. 

Knowing that time was running out before Mom came to fetch me, I ran over to the children’s section and grabbed a Junie B. Jones book I hadn’t read yet, as well as the newest Goosebumps book.

When I approached Mom, I tried to hide my wolf book under my selection of age appropriate literature, but Lori didn’t miss a thing.

“Study of the American Wolf, huh?”

I tried to brush past her comment and critical side eye,

“I thought you said I needed to be more realistic. Wolves are real, aren’t they?”

She sighed, rolling her eyes, handing it and my other books over to the librarian for check out. 

That evening at home, we had finished dinner and cleared the dining room table to play Jenga. The phone rang, and Dad stepped out of the room and into the kitchen to take it. Dad answered in a hushed tone, keeping his voice down. Unfortunately for Dad, he wasn’t a great whisperer. 

“Hey Dan… find any-?…How many…?” 

Silence. For a long while, silence. Mom and I locked eyes.

“God… Yeah, I see. Thank the boys for me… I’ll pay em for all their help… we both know that’s a lot of work. So sorry they had to… yeah… well… my God… I don’t know either, man… Yeah… Yeah… Thanks again Dan.”

Dad returned, doing his best to hide the weary look on his face. He glanced over at my Mom, and then at me, giving me a smile. I smiled back timidly. 

I looked back and forth between Mom and Dad, as she gave him a look that said, ‘You know she heard all that, right?’

Dad hummed, pursing his lips in a wry way. I couldn’t help but laugh at him. But the quiet that followed it sobered the moment.

""Amy,” My Dad paused as he weighed his words. “Your old man… is an awful whisperer.”

“Yeah, you kind of are.” I snickered.

“I know you’re a smart girl, even if you didn’t just hear me on the phone, I know that you know that some scary stuff is going on right now.”

I nodded. Dad sat back down at the table, folding his hands as he spoke.

“But I want you to know that while we’re at the farm, you aren’t in any danger as long as you listen to what your mother and I say. Follow the rules, stay in the yard, and don’t go into the pine rows. I don’t want this to cause you too much distress, because none of this is going to last forever. 

Mr Voss, myself and some other people in the community are getting evidence together, and filling paperwork out- which is stupid- but we are doing it to see if we can get the game warden or someone from DNR involved. Whoever ends up helping us, they will know what to do. Its their job, that my taxes pay for by the way, and the fact that they haven’t sent someone out already is-“

Mom kicked Dad under the table. Dad cleared his throat. 

“The point is, whatever this thing is, a bear, a wolf, its just wandered too far out of its habitat. Whenever someone from the state does get out there, they’ll either capture it or kill it or do whatever they have to to keep people safe, to keep us safe.” 

I nodded again with a small smile. I thought it was sweet that Mom and Dad were trying to keep my spirits up, especially when I could tell all of this weighed on them so heavily. 

I tried to lighten the mood a little bit, the way any 8 year old girl would, by being a little snarky.

“So, what will we do if the game warden looks at everything and says its a werewolf?” I said. 

To me it was only kind of a joke, but to Mom and Dad it was ridiculous, and that was all that mattered. Dad smirked.

“Ah yes, your mother told me all about your werewolf theory.”

“Well, what if it is?” I crossed my arms, making a face that wrinkled my nose.

Dad put on a gravely serious look, laying it on thick. 

“If it is, I’ll just have to melt down your mother’s silver dinnerware set into bullets.”

“Oh no you won’t! That set is an heirloom!” 

Dad dramatically lifted his hands, dropping them back down on the table in defeat.

“Well then, I guess your mother is just going to let us all die,”

Mom and I cracked up. Dad attempted to remain dry but the corners of his mouth crept up into a smile. 

“We’ll just have to try and stab the thing with silver butter knives. That’ll show ‘em.”

We cut-up for the rest of the evening, our hearts full of mirth as we turned in for the night. None of us spoke about it again for the rest of the week. But it festered in our minds, leaked into every unoccupied moment. I could see the apprehension buried in their eyes when they were lost in thought, driving, cooking dinner, staring out the window. I lied awake in bed every night, counting down the days until Friday, when we returned to the farm.

2. Cleaning supplies and keeping things hygienic; what’s the best detergent to buy if I have to hand wash items? How quickly does bleach degrade? Anything else you are buying to keep stocked (garbage bags, disposable plates, etc). 

3. Any info packs on water storage? Or any links to where I can better understand the best or most affordable way to prep water stores. 

4. As someone avoiding Amazon, where can I get Mylar bags that won’t break the bank?

“She’s doing wonderfully, Joanne. Administrative assistant. Mhm. The backbone of the modern workplace, they say. *My* Darochka!”

  
 Natasha Shevchenko adjusted the cream-colored daffodils on her kitchen counter, smiling with her mouth more than her eyes. Her daughter, Darla McCannehan ate her Lucky Charms from across the granite kitchen countertop, a rainbow marshmallow on her lip. The daffodils were likely a gift from one of her mother’s lovers from the upper east side. Darla’s mother liked the finance types, but they all had a horrendous taste in flowers. 



With the phone wedged between a shoulder and her ear, Natasha continued to speak while glancing over at Darla, to make sure she was still listening.

“I always knew she was intent on something big like this.” a pause. Natasha’s smile sank. Slight, but Darla could notice. Or maybe it hadn't- with the bi-annual botox Natasha had gotten it was hard to tell.

“She’s a *professional responsible for providing organizational, clerical, and logistical support to ensure efficient operation of an office or department.* Yes, I know Joanne-”.



Darla couldn't help but smile over her bowl of Lucky Charms. She had said this to her mother when she first got the job, that she was a *professional responsible for* *blah blah blah*, only because that's what they had written in the linkedIn listing. Truth be told, she hadn’t the slightest clue what an administrative assistant does, and she’d been working as one for four months. Or so she thought. 



Every weekday was a blur for Darla. She could recall wearing her pantyhose and buttoning up a shirt in the frigid air, hazy with her hangover and frost, and taking the Q train from Brighton beach to Grand Central Station. She can remember stepping up into a big building, about to open the doors, and then *blank!* Nine hours later, she was on the Q train back to little Odessa, where she would stop by the Russian store for some borscht with a thick glob of sour cream and a bottle of blue gin to take home. She’d sip it in the cold dill scented-air of Brighton park under the neon red lights watching little old slavic women shuffle by with red painted lips and kerchiefs wrapped around their hair all while she’d think,

*What the fuck is an administrative assistant?*



On this especially hungover Saturday morning, Darla McCannehan could hardly see the marshmallows in her cereal, her eyes puffy shut. The night before, she had bought a bottle of gin, and when the shopkeeper gave her a strange face, she told him she was making negronis. Negronis. *Class*, she thought. Maybe she did plan on making them, but when she came home and checked the cupboards, she found her mother finished the campari, and so she decided to just take it on the rocks, she thought, *still* *class*. However, when the freezer’s ice was smelling like frozen pierogies and the martini glasses were covered with lipstick stains and filthy remnants of merlot, she resigned to her fate, bringing the rim of a half liter of Bombay Sapphire to her mouth, passing out on her bedroom floor shortly after. When she awoke the next morning, brushing clumps of mascara out of her mouth, she was pleased to see that she only finished half the bottle. A little smile crept across her face. *Restraint,* she thought. *Very classy.* 



Light streamed in through the windows of her mothers apartment, and fell down upon the garbage can that lay open beside the counter, full of crispy, ugly bouquets-  likely from her mothers other lovers. Natasha Shevchenko was raised in Ukraine, and believed that slavic women had an edge to the western world. They had their beauty, and more than that- their sanctity and their pride. She fed that sanctity through her myriad of online coaches she had hired, in total costing her about a grand a month to all teach her things about being a ‘High Value Woman’, like never letting a man take you out for coffee. Never split a bill. 

“Daffodils only go to women of very high value, Darochka.” Natasha would say.



 Natasha was vehemently against whores. When she and Darla walked along the Brighton pier at night, she would look at the young girls in their latex boots and short skirts with narrow eyes. She’d whisper to Darla, hot in her ear,

“Stay away from that type. There’s nothing less high-value than a *slut”.*

Darla agreed. She was no slut. Darla was a *dancer*.

  


It all began when the *Girls Chateau* came to East 46th street.



	The *Girls Chateau* was a strip club that opened and closed sporadically due to the frequent prostitution raids in the area (it was a shittier part of midtown Manhattan). With new management, they opened again one fateful January evening, much to the dismay of the building owners in the vicinity. The slogan they had chosen to rebrand with was ‘*Sluttier than Sex!’* much to the dismay of the landlords and property owners nearby, one of which being Vicky Kleinman, who went to school with Darla. She posted vicariously on facebook to protest *Girls Chateau*, asking ‘what would the children think, with *hookers* roaming about???’ Vicky was the first of Darla’s friends to marry, and the lucky bitch got a range rover from her husband in exchange for having three of his twelve-pounder babies. The range rover was fabulous, and Vicky knew it -she posted more pictures of the damn thing than her fat little children. Pictures were sandwiched around the hooker comment on her Facebook, of the sleek black exterior and red patent leather seats. *Classy.* 



 	Darla remembered opening night of *Girls Chateau* a Friday after her work. It was all very bright, with many bright green signs lettering ‘*Sluttier than Sex!’* in curly cursive, and lethargic men loitering outside with their cigarettes, eyeing the base of her pencil skirt. *Not classy,* she thought. But inside, there was something glowing, and it wasn't just the hideous pink mood lighting, but it was coming from beyond the foyer, from the stage. Darla checked her watch. There would be another train in a half-hour. She walked past the loiterers and made her way in.



	The first thing that hit her was the brilliant air, warm and heavy with  alcohol and vanilla- sweat, and cheap cologne. The second thing that hit her was Dora.



	Dora was on the main pole, in the very front of the great big stage. Her hair was dark blue, tumbling down her shoulders in synthetic curls. And her ivory skin gleamed, with sweat or oil or maybe both, shining under the neon light. The floor to ceiling mirrors enclosing *Chateau* made it so that wherever you turned, every wall, there she was. Dora here Dora there Dora everywhere. Surrounding you with her magnetism in every *clack clack clack* of her blue stilettos.



	She was wearing hardly anything, a neon blue thong and a bra, with a tutu around her waist. Yet, she was classy. That shocked Darla. Somehow, in her thong and all, she was Grace Kelly, she was Princess *fucking* Diana. The way she moved, with her hips, and then with her legs was electric, and the hairs stood up on the back of Darla’s neck just watching. As she saw Dora, twisting and swirling, the crowd and the music was null. It was just Darla and Dora alone in the world, for a brief moment. As Dora began to arch over and pour some whiskey into a man’s mouth, Darla turned around and pushed the doors open to leave, the cold air condensating on her piping hot face.



	Dora probably knew what her job was. Without a doubt. She would go home and not make up some bullshit like Darla, no Dora *danced.* And what a beautiful thing that was! How could anyone be more High Value than what she had just seen- it's not possible. On the Q train back to Brighton, Darla held on to the metal pole, and closed her eyes, very tight. She imagined herself- in that tutu and thong, with a thigh on the pole and hands outstretched, to all of her loving patrons, turning and smiling and radiant. 



And that night, she skipped her borscht to come straight home.. Her mother was gone, but she saw a fresh bouquet of red roses on the counter, so some East Village man had bought her the night for herself. Darla drank straight from the bottle, feeling it burn down her throat as she ripped off her blouse. The night was loud as always in Brighton heights, but in the silence of that apartment Darla was louder. Her hips were loud, as she spun around her imaginary pole, untouchable, beautiful, *classy* and finally leaned her head back to laugh, hearing the hollow yet heavy sound bouncing against the walls before passing out where her mother found her the next morning, face down on the cold linoleum. 



	“What is *wrong ˆ*with you Darochka? Look at this - she kicked Darla’s bra lying on the floor - Why are you behaving like a, like a- “ Shrieked Natasha, flailing her hands to find the word. It was freezing, around eight in the morning, Darla guessed. She tried to get up, but winced suddenly, pressing a hand to her temple. God, her head hurt. Darla looked around - *what happened yesterday?* and then she saw the empty bottle of gin and remembered. The dancer. She was a dancer. 

	“Whore?” Darla suggested it to her mother.

	“Yes *whore!* What is happening? This is not the Darochka I had raised, waking up in her underwear, like some cheap slut. Oh my *god*!” Natasha was furious now with her eyebrows raised and her manicured fingers twitching.. Darla tried to gauge the severity of how angry she was, but couldn't. Damn the botox. Anywho, she didn't care all too much. If Darla left now, she could make the next train, and so she left her mother shrieking and screeching with rage as she pulled her clothes on and ran for the 8:30 Q.



At work, it wasn't a blank anymore. Darla sat at her office chair, sending emails or taking calls or whatnot, all the while looking through the window, and seeing right into the *Girls Chateau*. Through one of the dirtied mirrors, she could see a magnificent, shiny-smooth pole. In the sobering morning air it didn't look like much, but god, Darla could remember the smell of sweat and the moves and the magic like it was happening right now in this moment. Whatever she could see from her window was enough to be all she could think of for her eight hours administrative assisting that day. She imagined herself dancing on the pole, on the velvet floors in the big plastic heels. She had wrapped her leg around the base of her office chair and pictured herself in her mind - beautiful and spinning and up and down, and oh so very classy. 



* This is what admin assist does, dream of dancing. What do the dancers dream of?

But feel free to send your resume to X when you are searching for full time employment!” I have absolutely had it with this semester. From moot court professor being absolutely sociopathic to evidence professor blasting through WEEKS (plural) of reading material in 10 minutes, saying “this is bullshit I’m not testing you on it.”, and then moving even further through material we couldn’t have possibly read for that class. 

And all of this after a summer of multiple rounds of interviews with several firms to get told to take a hike. All this while working for one of the most prestigious firms in my city to only be called stupid and “unteachable” because lord knows I wasn’t taught class actions in my civ pro class so my bad I didn’t know every requirement to properly plead the case.

At 630 am, Tziporet Carmel was surprised to find herself waking up so early.

Ziporet: “I’m a late sleeper and I seldom get up that early. And this was Saturday, a day I always sleep late. But something disturbed me and I felt drawn to walk to the kitchen. When I got there. The room was bathed in a strange light, this even though the sun was up. I went outside and checked the grounds. As I went around the storage shed, I noticed what I thought was a new fruit silo in the field about a hundred meters from me. I remembered thinking, why would anyone put a silo there and in the middle of the night at that? I took a closer look at the silo and realized this was no ordinary container. It was silver colored for one thing, which is not standard for silos. It seemed square shaped from the angle I was looking. Along its side were eighteen glowing square windows which looked like diamonds in a necklace. Five huge beams of powerful light shone from the roof into the northern sky. And the silo was emitting what looked like sparklers along its side. I guessed the size of the silo to be about five meters in length and about three meters high. But then it seemed to grow another story. By that I mean, a second section materialized and doubled the height of the silo. Then I saw what, at first, I thought was a worker a few meters from the silo. When I saw him, so did the dogs and they went crazy. The worker was over seven feet tall and wore metallic overalls, something like aluminum foil. He wore a sombrero with a veil that covered his face that in totality looked like a beekeeper’s hat. We both stared at each other for perhaps thirty seconds and I realized finally who he was. I quietly whispered, ‘Why don’t you take off your hat so I can see your face?” I heard his answer clearly in my head. He said in Hebrew, ‘Kakha zeh,’ meaning, that’s the way it is. After that, I felt impelled to go back to my kitchen and boil some coffee. When I went back outside, the ship and its occupant was gone.”

The surprises weren’t over yet. The next morning, they found a 15-foot-diameter round circle of “dissolved vegetation” where the craft had been, and next to it where the being had stood was another 4-foot-diameter circle. Inside the larger circle they found deposits of very pure silicon. Two weeks later, more strange circles were found in her backyard. Some had a strange red fluid inside them which, after testing, turned out to be mostly cadmium.

But wait, there’s more. Following her encounter, Tziporet says, “I was nauseous for days, had horrible diarrea, fits of shivering and couldn’t stop sleeping. It was like a bad flu.”

Other people who stood in the circle were also affected in various ways. Barry Chamish, who investigated the case reported feeling very sick after standing in the circle. Another researcher, Danny Yaacobi, says he got sick, but then the arthritis in his knees disappeared. Formerly he had to walk with a cane. Researcher Avi Grief had a similar reaction and says, “I had a painfully weak ankle that always impaired me. It was repaired after visiting the Carmel landing site and has never returned. My theory is that there is something healing in the initial sick feeling.”

Eight months later, Barry Chamish visited the landing site and the circle was still there. Tziporet warned him not to stay too long, but as Barry says, “I couldn’t resist looking for signs of the landing that might have been overlooked. After scratching through the burnt and charred remains of wood and plastic and digging through the still burnt roots of former plant life for about twenty minutes, I felt genuinely lousy like a flu was approaching and spent the remainder of the day mooching pain killers from the people I was interviewing. I told Tsiporet that if she hadn’t have planted the suggestion in the first place,I wouldn’t have had a psychosomatic reaction. She replied, ‘It wouldn’t have made a difference. Everyone who stays too long at the spot gets sick after.’”

Another strange effect, Tziporah now found she could see auras, and she also believes she gained healing powers.

1om3zu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1om3zu8/aio_for_cutting_off_my_work_friends_after_they/,AIO for cutting off my work friends after they cancelled a Halloween party?,"Sorry in advance for the short novel, but I will try to keep to the chronological facts and keep my emotions out of things as much as I am able to. 

For some background, I used to work for the same company but at a different branch store with a coworker who became a very close friend. (We went through some junk at the old store and I ended up following him to a corporate store after everything was said and done.) 

For anonymity I’ll call myself “Marie” (28F), my friend from my old store “Mark” (19M), and my partner “Tyler” (29M). (Yes I had to make a key to keep all my fake names straight 🤣 and yes this is a throwaway acc)

When Mark and I swapped to this store and met our new coworkers, I won’t lie, they weren’t…perfectly meshed with our vibe, but I really naively wanted to have a work team where we were all friends and could hangout outside of work as well...

Mark and I often used to go out to eat after work to decompress together, sometimes bringing along Tyler whenever he wasn’t stuck at work or too tired. 

Over time of working here, we became particularly close with a coworker I’ll call “Elise” (~28F? I know we are very close in age), and decided a bit last second to invite her along to a dinner as well as her fiancé “Kyle” (25M) one day. 
(Now. Kyle and Elise…have a history of arguing, and more than once Elise has come to work crying over something he had said about her weight, how she was eating, and has slapped her at least 3 times that I know of. I’ve been in abusive relationships in the past, and even though it was pretty triggering, I decided I wouldn’t be open with her about my feelings about Kyle to stay friends and be there for her if she eventually needed it. Kyle also has terminal cancer, which may have made me a little naively extra empathetic to their situation.)

At this time, my partner Tyler was working some seriously long hours, weeks in a row without days off at a time as a GM for a restaurant chain. (Often about 4am-4pm or later on any given day,  even closing at 10pm some days, AND he walked about 1.5 miles to get there then back since our work schedules didn’t line up for me to take him. Times are better now. 😅) 

On this day we decided last minute to go to a buffet, he had been at work before 3am because it was an inventory truck day, and since it had been a rough one, decided to have a buzzball on his way back, and once home, before knowing we might be going anywhere, went ahead and over the course of an hour and a half or so had another 3 shots at home. He wasn’t trashed, but he certainly was not sober. However, sensing my social anxiety over meeting Kyle in person for the first time, agreed he would come along, just apologized if he wasn’t very social since he was so tired, which I warned Elise and Mark of ahead of time so they’d all know. 

We beat them to the buffet by a few minutes, and waited in the car until they called and told us to meet them outside of their car because they’d brought us all some shots 💀 as we walked over, he let me know those were all on me or he might not last the dinner, but they were 99 shots and awful and I just could not 😂 Tyler was going to just tell them he would pass on his, but they made a little camaraderie speech and he gave in for the one shot. After that, all good vibes, he shut the door to their car to be nice and we all headed inside, but as predicted after 1 plate he asked for my keys to go lay down in the car and fell asleep. 

They knew he was tired, and we had a good time overall I had thought, so it came as a big surprise to me after a few weeks of slightly weird behavior (invited me to come over one weekend, but asked if it would just be me, and ended up conveniently cancelling shortly after when they found out Tyler would come, etc) from Elise when Mark (who hangs out with Elise and Kyle outside of work, just them) let me know that Kyle was angry with Tyler; Apparently he said that whenever he shut his car door, the weather stripping came loose, which he saw as a sign of disrespect. Now, they never ended up saying anything to me or Tyler about it, and I ended up just casually ‘not being available’ for most plans they tried to make afterward, up until their wedding I had promised Elise I’d go to. Which she was unsure about even happening just days before after they’d argued and he slapped her again. 

Tyler and I went to and were ignored at their wedding, but I didn’t take that too personally since it’s a wedding and a lot is going on. But after everything was over and she was back from their honeymoon, she attempted to make  plans again and instead of skirting around the issue, I decided to go ahead and clear the air on the situation, considering we’d just earlier been discussing that we didn’t want to go to the employee-only team builder since we couldn’t bring our partners (Our ‘social batteries’.) and I thought she would get it. She did seem pretty genuinely apologetic about the situation, and asked that we please go through with the dinner plans with everyone to truly clear the air. We went, and did have a good time, so I really thought whatever happened was just a weird fluke and over and done with. 

Fast forward to now, it’s been almost another ~2 months maybe? It’s been busy for everyone, and we haven’t done much as a group outside of talk about making a Discord server for gaming sessions. 

New context! I’ve been wanting to throw a Halloween party for the last couple years, but friends kept flaking last minute. So I brought this up with Elise and Mark and we decided we should do a small get together with everyone. In the beginning, I talked to Mark about us hosting it in a hotel with an indoor pool (just because I wanted to go swimming lol) but Elise insisted it’d be more fun to host at her and Kyle’s house and that they had a hot tub to use (which we’ll pretend is an equivalent substitute for ease 😪) and we gave in and said we would host it there, everyone else would just bring food and snacks and stuff. 

Apologies for story jumping whiplash, but back to the Discord server! 😂
I wanted it to be nice and built so I made it, themed it all Halloweeny, added some bots for fun and invited Mark, Elise and Tyler. Tyler was at work and can’t be on his phone, so for around 8 hours it was just myself, Mark and Elise. Sending memes, making jokes, although when adding Kyle was brought up since that was the point of the server, we got some rapid and mixed responses. At first it was that she didn’t know how to add someone to a server, so I sent her an invite link. Then she said she’d do it later, only later to say he ‘wouldn’t get our sense of humor’ and that she didn’t want to add him. It was kinda weird, but I ignored it and figured he just didn’t want to be in the server, & frankly didn’t really care anyway. 

However later that night I get a call from Mark asking if he and Elise can come over and hang out for a while until her parents got home because Kyle had just hit her super hard and kicked her out, and she was at his house suuuuuper drunk and crying. 
I told them to come over, apologized to Tyler who’d just gotten home and let him know that given the ‘beef’ between him and Kyle and how blunt Tyler can be sometimes, that it might be better for him to not bring up or feed into talking about Kyle since I didn’t really know what state she was in. 
We played some Evil Apples to kill time because I thought that’d distract her, but she seemed super uncomfortable the whole time, which by extension put me on edge the whole time, and eventually she ended up saying she wanted to go ahead and head home. (Mark had her location shared and I asked him to watch it like a hawk because she was definitely still not sober, but insisting on leaving on her own.) 
I assumed, falsely, that home meant her parents house. 
But went into work with her the next day to find out “they’re good now” and to get a really weird excuse that their dogs just had surgery and they decided not to host the party since they didn’t want people around stressing them out any worse. I say weird because of the way it was said to me gave me an….off vibe. But our other coworker…”Eve” (20F) had asked me directly the day before to let her know as soon as I did if the party was happening or not, so I texted her to say that it was not, but that we would try again for New Years. She responded “Oh no, my husband might not be in town then but maybe”. 

I was afraid I might have just been being paranoid, but everyone I spoke to about the party’s responses seemed…off. 

I did not end up finding out that night, but the next day when I was off Mark called me to let me know that Elise had made a separate groupchat with everyone else including our manager telling them that because they didn’t want to deal with the Tyler situation, that they would be giving me an excuse that the party was not happening, and to be sure not to let me know. 

Which, I feel is bad enough, honestly. However, this issue is compounded by the other newer coworker Eve. 

Mark is in a relationship with a guy who, since I’ve known him, has been a long distance relationship (they have lived together before), but he moved back into town with him on the same day that the false-party-excuse happened. And Mark and….”Luke” (28M) had been gaming with Elise and Kyle and were planning originally to go to said Halloween party as well, however to convince Luke about excluding me, they got on a group call and Elise, Kyle, and Eve (Eve has never even met Tyler once) just started tearing into how Tyler acts the few times they’ve seen him (he’s an introvert and we work in sales so it can be a lot) how disrespectful he is, and then start implying that Mark (who is gay) and myself (who is practically asexual) have something going on because we’re close friends who hug and buy each other coffee. 😂 Thankfully, I think that Mark was able to make that very clear to Luke that nothing was going on and that he needed to meet and get his own impression of Tyler. Time will tell soon. 

AIO for cutting them off and leaving GCs/deleting our server? 

I only talk to them at work now if they ask me a work related question, and they’re clearly starting to get VERY bothered by it. They never even asked me about why I left all of the chats or deleted them, just asked Mark when he came in later if he’d “told on them”. I feel bad for making the vibe at the kiosk a little negative and quiet since I won’t chat with them, but I feel a bit bitter over everything past a point of being nice just to smooth things over at work.

I remember walking into that room like I was crossing into another dimension — part fear, part curiosity, and a whole lot of shame. The coffee smelled burnt, the fluorescent lights buzzed, and every chair squeaked like it was judging me. I didn’t know what to expect — a sermon, a lecture, maybe a circle of people confessing things I wasn’t ready to say out loud.

I sat in the back. Hood up, arms crossed, already planning my escape. But something unexpected happened — no one looked at me like I was broken. They nodded. Smiled even. Like they *knew* me before I said a word.

The meeting started with the Serenity Prayer, and my throat tightened halfway through it. I hadn’t prayed in years, but something about those words — *“the courage to change the things I can”* — hit like a punch to the chest. Because courage was exactly what I didn’t think I had anymore.

When it came time for people to share, I listened. A guy talked about losing his family, another about waking up in jail. One woman said she drank because she couldn’t stand herself sober. I thought, *yeah… I know that one*. Every story sounded like a remix of my own life — different verses, same song.

Then someone said, “Keep coming back — it works if you work it.” Corny, I thought. But when the meeting ended, people actually came up and introduced themselves. They didn’t ask what I did for work or how long I’d been sober. Just *“Glad you’re here, man.”*

That was it — no judgment, no pity. Just connection. The thing I didn’t realize I’d been dying for.

When I walked out, the air felt different. I wasn’t cured, or even sure I’d come back. But I knew one thing — for the first time in a long time, I didn’t feel alone.

That night, I didn’t drink.

And that’s where everything started to change. would love to hear ba form you. maybe your experience?",1,1762044296.0,soberseekers,0,1.0,False

Thinking of trying again, I miss her when I thought I wouldn't ever again.","When I was 21, I got into a relationship with this amazing girl. We met in college and she quickly became a close friend. She was warm, joyful, confident and so full of life. So many aspects of our lifestyle matched, she was outdoorsy and loved going on roadtrips with me. Always down for whatever and the best banter even with her ridiculous takes. We fell for each other and dated for about 6 months before we broke up. It hurt at first, but then I realized it just made sense. She was traditional in the sense she wanted marriage and kids. I never really wanted that, though at that age, I kind of considered it down the road just for her.

She was always trying to accommodate me and my needs since I was trying to go to med school and she understood it was a rigorous journey. We talked about how we'd be long distance inevitably since it's hard to get into med school in the same state and she was open to it. She kept putting work into the relationship, trying to arrange dates, calls and all that while I became pretty passive because I was burnt out. She grew resentful and would always be hurting at my lack of initiative though I tried explaing my circumstances, and ultimately we decided it was better to part ways. This was 7 years ago. 

Since then, I moved to a different state to finish med school, am in the middle of residency and have dated a few girls. Here and there over the years, she's crossed my mind, when I see the hockey stick she got me or when I see the funny card she got me. But it was always a passing memory, fond but not lasting. Obviously I've been attracted to other women since her, gone on dates, been in relationships and they've been good, but recently, I can't seem to get her out of my mind.

The best part of our relationship was the friendship we built a year before our relationship. We understood each other and supported one another, and the affection was just the next step. Conflict wore down the emotions, but now I look back at hw little I actually invested in keeping the relationship going. Could we have survived back then? With my relational skills back then and her over investing compared to me, most likely not. Love is an action, not just the feelings. It grows with effort, by staying with someone, paying attention to the little things, the small acts that show you're there. Remembering their coffee order or what makes them laugh. And trying. Investing time. I couldn't do much of that, not even take her on dates or ask her how her day was consistently in a way that showed commitment. I wanted her, but was chasing my biggest goal which made her much lower in my list of priorities, eventually leading to me checking out.

I'm still friends with her on Facebook and after all the girls I've been with and dated, I've been missing my ex. I see her roadtrips or the way she excitedly decorates her clinic for Halloween and think about the times we had. Her music recommendations or the way she posts when the Seahawks win a game. At 28, somehow I now want a partner. Someone to do life with, go on adventures with and build something by motivating one another. She still feels like the same girl, we still have things in common and I'm still fond of her. She feels like the one that got away, just because I didn't value her outwardly or prioritize her when I had a chance. We were young and still learning. I didn't miss her for so long and obviously felt like I moved on quick, about 2 months after the breakup I was like it is what it is. But now the feelings seem to be coming back.

I don't know if I'm crazy, but it doesn't seem like she has a partner in her life right now and I wonder if I should reach out. She's still in our home state, where my parents are while I've moved away for residency. We aren't near but I go back to visit family. I want to give this one more real shot. We've grown up and accomplished some of our goals, I want to do the rest of them with her. Roadtrip all across the country, building a home, all the big and little things. Sometimes I think distance and time reminds you what you lost. And I feel like I rather have a ""if at first you don't succeed"" than a ""what if"" in my mind for the rest of my life. Don't want to live with the regret that I never tried again despite feeling like it might just work. Love is always a risk, but it's one you have to take to find your person. I knew she loved me then, I hope we can do it again.

1om3y14,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1om3y14/turns_out_i_was_likely_never_bipolar/,Turns out I was likely never bipolar,"I’m 17M, undiagnosed. For a few months I’ve thought of the possibility of being bipolar after experiencing what at the time I thought to be hypomanic episodes. During the first “episode”, nothing crazy happened except for getting into lots of arguments and not sleeping a lot. I did at the time report feeling euphoric but looking back at it, I was likely imagining it. I also have a feeling that the increased irritation was caused by my lack of sleep. During my second episode, I felt euphoric for a few days and extremely energetic. I do believe this might’ve been caused by placebo, as at the time I believed I was in a hypomanic episode. Later on during the “episode”, I decided to attempt to consume a LOT of caffeine to make my mania more extreme. I do believe that I acted like this in order to try to imitate how a person in a manic episode might act and further reinforce the belief of being bipolar. I ended up consuming over 500 mg. I pulled an all-nighter and was wondering around the streets at 6 AM, but again, looking back at it, I did consume over 0,5 grams of caffeine so being energetic and euphoric was also expected. The crash occurred in the evening (16 hours after the coffee consumption), which makes sense considering that the effects of the caffeine wore off.

Yes, I have also had “depressive episodes” of which the most recent one lasted over two months, while the others were around 2 weeks. I actually do believe that these were real, but depression is a thing of its own and doesn’t require bipolar to be present.

I’ve been not-depressed for almost 2 weeks now, and I’m actually excited to start living life again. I know it may seem like I have bipolar disorder, and yes, I am aware that denial is often a part of bipolar, but I genuinely can’t bring myself to believe I have bipolar. Either way I’ve not had a “hypomanic episode” in over two months and I’m actually excited to start living again without having to worry about mood episodes.",1,1762044251.0,BipolarReddit,1,0.67,False

I don't have anyone I can ask personally. I love my partner and I don't want anyone to think differently of them. Equally I'm very embarrassed that I feel like I'm being hard done by and don't want anyone to think I'm spoilt. 

Background:
I earn 65k a year. My partner earns 65k a year. We both give 7% into our pensions.  Childallowance we put  into kids credit unions.  Paid into the same account. 

Monthly Spends:
Mortgage 1k. 
Savings 2.4k
Childcare 700
Bills 700

Partner -300
Me - 300

With my 300 I get a month this needs to cover my own personal savings, my holidays, my nights out, my clothes, my shoes, my make up, my hair cuts,my shampoo, my jewlery, my phone's, my accessories etc, presents for my partner, holidays, coffees. 

Honestly. I'm finding this hard. Like so hard. Am I being a princess? Do I need a reality check? Deodrant costing 8€ a pop christ. But I know I could go cheaper on the shampoo I buy...it's €20 a bottle BUT it lasts me 10 weeks sometimes 11. And it's helping my hair grow back postpartum.  

Please be kind. I'm trying to become a better person and work on myself. He thinks I spend too much and it really puts a wall up in him. I'm tried showing how I find it hard but maybe actually I am spoilt. Please help.

2 mg/week split into 2 doses of 1 mg every 3.5 days. 

My body has responded VERY strongly to this substance—for the first week I felt like I had a very bad flu mixed with COVID. I could barely walk and was in bed whenever I wasn’t working. Propped up on Adderal, Tylenol, aspirin and tons of coffee when I was not horizontal.      

I’m still nauseous and super fatigued all the time, allodynia all the time. Dizzy and faint frequently (yes, I drink a dose of electrolytes daily). 

I half wonder if 90% of the weight loss has just been from the severe daily nausea. This has made it hard to eat adequate protein (frequently as little as 30-40ish grams per day I think—currently on vacation in a country where “vegetarian” means “bread and vegetables”). I think I have a bit of sarcopenia. 

For my most recent dose I finally went from stomach to thigh for injection site, hoping that helps with side effects. 

Would love to hear your experience here—how long did it take for side effects to decrease or vanish? Any tips for dealing with the side effects mentioned above?

For a bit over two years I was on prozac and it worked really well. My mind felt quieter and I had far fewer panic attacks and anxiety. It truly gave me my life back. 
About 5 months ago I started to slowly taper off the med to see how I would do. I felt great and eventually stopped taking it when I ran out of 10mg capsules. 
I was doing great for the most part and pleasantly surprised by the ease of getting off of it. I felt like I had really healed a lot. 
3 months ago I moved across the country to go back to college. Shortly after moving my partner and I broke up and about a month ago I found out the college housing Id been placed in had a mold infestation. After all of this i’ve had an horrific increase in anxiety and panic attacks which feels understandable due to the circumstances. I decided to ask my provider to start me up again on Prozac since it’s worked so well for me in the past. about a week ago I started taking 10mg to work myself back up to my previous dose (50mg).
A week in and I feel like my anxiety is at an all time high. I cant have a cup of coffee without my entire day being ruined by anxiety. 

I don’t remember this the first time I started taking it and it’s making me feel really scared and depressed. I don’t feel like I can keep taking this if this is the new side effect but I also don’t feel like I can go on how I am now. What the hell is happening?

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Ideally you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

About a month ago, we broke up a separate time after I saw some messages between him and a girl he used to like. He was retelling a story of an old middle school crush he had, said “thanks for listening to my love story” and said goodnight to her. I know it sounds dramatic but I also broke up with him after that because, and I know this is impulsive, we had so many arguments that week and honestly I felt drained. But I decided to get back with him about to weeks later and give it another chance. Until, I found several more messages between him and the same girl. In those messages, I found it strikingly odd that he kept the same tone and style he would when he messages me. He also sent a weird (flirty?) text that read “I remember when I used to make coffee for you.” I tried to shake off the feeling of paranoia for about a week, but after seeing that I felt I just couldn’t trust him anymore.  When I broke up with him through text, he sent me messages like “I’m trying to be calm right now but I’m so fucking pissed,” “This is another level of overthinking,” “I’m giving you this one opportunity to fix this right now,” and “You should probably answer because this will be the last time I ever talk to you.” And just yesterday I found out that she was clinging onto him at a pumpkin patch he went to with his friends when we were apart for those two weeks and he did nothing about it. Honestly I feel conflicted because I don’t know if it really counted as cheating. 

TLDR: Found my boyfriend of two years messaging and entertaining the girl he used to like, but I’m second guessing myself if it was grounds for a breakup.

The holiday season is supposed to be about joy and connection, but it often kicks off with a silent panic: *""What on earth do I get everyone?""*

We've all been there. You scroll through endless lists of generic gifts—the scented candle, the multi-tool, the ""funny"" socks—that end up regifted, returned, or gathering dust in a closet.

This is not one of those lists.

Welcome to your **definitive Christmas gift ideas guide for 2025**. We're ditching the mundane and focusing on what people *really* want right now: gifts that are smarter, more sustainable, more personal, and more experiential. Whether you're shopping for a tech guru, a homebody, or someone dedicated to saving the planet, we've got you covered.

---

## 🎁 For the Tech Obsessed: Living in the AI-Powered Future

By 2025, ""tech gifts"" have evolved beyond the newest tablet. It's about AI integration, seamless connectivity, and solving everyday problems with a touch of magic.

*   **AI-Powered Plant Monitor:** Perfect for the friend who loves plants but has a black thumb. These sensors not only track light and moisture but use AI to tell you *exactly* what your ficus is feeling and needs. It's like a therapist for your monstera.
*   **Next-Gen Adaptive Noise-Canceling Headphones:** Forget simple noise-canceling. The 2025 models use AI to analyze your environment in real-time, adapting the level of cancellation based on whether you're on a busy street, in an office, or just want some quiet at home.
*   **The Smart Journal:** This is a digital-physical hybrid. You write in a beautiful, paper-like notebook with a special pen, and an app transcribes, organizes, and even summarizes your thoughts using AI. It's the ultimate tool for self-reflection and productivity.
*   **Subscription to an AI Butler Service:** Give the gift of time. Services like a premium version of ChatGPT or specialized AI assistants can now manage calendars, book appointments, draft emails, and even plan entire vacations based on a few prompts.
*   **AR Smart Glasses:** They're finally becoming sleek and useful. Think of them as a heads-up display for life, offering real-time navigation, language translation in your field of view, and discreet notifications without needing to pull out your phone.

---

## 🌿 For the Conscious Consumer: Sustainable & Stylish

The ""go green"" movement is no longer a niche; it's the default. Gifting sustainably shows you care about the person *and* the planet.

*   **Refillable Beauty or Home Goods Subscription:** Services that deliver high-quality, eco-friendly refills for everything from shampoo to cleaning products are huge. It's a gift that keeps on giving while cutting down on plastic waste.
*   **High-Quality, Lifetime-Reusable Items:** Think a beautiful, insulated travel mug that they'll actually use for years, a set of perfectly designed stainless steel straws, or a waxed canvas tote bag that replaces a dozen plastic ones. Quality over quantity is the mantra.
*   **A Master Class in a Sustainable Skill:** Give a workshop or online course on something like beekeeping, composting, making natural dyes, or woodworking. It’s an experience that imparts lasting value.
*   **Artisan & Fair Trade Goods Box:** Curate a box yourself or subscribe to a service that delivers handmade goods from global artisans. This supports small businesses and provides unique, story-rich items.
*   **Digital Picture Frame (with a Twist):** Load it up with photos, but also with beautiful images of national parks they can ""visit,"" or art from eco-conscious artists. It's a gift that reminds them of what's worth protecting.

---

## ✈️ For the Experience Seeker: Memories Over Things

The most valuable gift you can give is a great memory. The ""experience economy"" is booming in 2025, and for good reason.

*   **A ""Mystery Trip"" Voucher:** Companies now specialize in planning surprise weekend getaways based on a budget and a few interests (e.g., ""relaxing,"" ""adventurous,"" ""foodie""). The recipient gets a voucher and the anticipation is half the fun.
*   **Membership to a ""Tasting Box"" Club:** This goes beyond wine. Think a unique hot sauce club, an artisanal olive oil subscription, or a craft beer selection from small, independent breweries.
*   **An Introductory Flight Lesson:** For the ultimate thrill-seeker. A discovery flight in a small plane is an unforgettable experience that few people ever get to try.
*   **A Spa Day, Reimagined:** Look for futuristic wellness options like a float tank session, cryotherapy, or a salt cave meditation. It’s relaxation for the modern age.
*   **Tickets to a Unique Event:** Skip the concert and get tickets to an immersive art exhibit (like a teamLab or Meow Wolf experience), a live podcast recording, or a pop-up dinner from a celebrity chef.

---

## 🛋️ For the Homebody & Comfort Lover: Creating a Sanctuary

More people are investing in making their home a true sanctuary. Gifts that enhance comfort, ambiance, and entertainment are always a win.

*   **The ""Smart"" Weighted Blanket:** The 2025 versions connect to an app, allowing for gentle warming and even subtle vibration patterns for relaxation. It's the ultimate comfort gadget.
*   **Custom Star Map or ""Soundwave"" Art:** Use an online service to create a beautiful print of the night sky from a significant date (an anniversary, a birthday) or the soundwave of a special message (""I love you,"" a baby's first laugh).
*   **Gourmet Coffee or Tea Subscription:** Elevate their daily ritual with a subscription to a small-batch roaster or a rare tea importer. Many offer tasting notes and origin stories with each delivery.
*   **Smart Candle Warmer & Diffuser:** A device that safely melts scented wax from the bottom up, releasing the fragrance without a flame. Many can be controlled via an app to set timers and scent intensity.
*   **Ultra-Portable, High-Quality Projector:** Turn any wall into a movie screen. The new projectors are tiny, have incredible battery life, and project in stunning 4K, perfect for cozy nights in.

### The Final Thought: Thoughtfulness is the Ultimate Trend

No matter what you choose, the best **Christmas gift ideas** in 2025 all share one thing: thoughtfulness. It’s not about the price tag; it's about showing you see the person and understand what makes them tick.

**> Pro-Tip:** Don't just give the gift. Give the *story*. Attach a small note explaining *why* you chose it for them. That personal touch is what transforms a great gift into an unforgettable one.

New PhD student here. So far I have only two friends, one of them my flatmate - absolute gems I happened to meet through, um, reddit. I am trying to make more friends but it has been hard doing that through social events since I get quite reserved in large groups. 

Well, most of my hobbies are introverted activities - I read fiction, write prose and poems, watch cinema and tv shows, and go for walks in the woods/parks (y'all know hikingshawty?).And this reduces the odds of meeting new people!

Fellow introverts (and extroverts who don't mind a quiet companion), hit me up, lets grab coffee or go for a stroll sometime!

PS: I'm queer and neurodivergent, I'd love to connect with queer community and neurodivergent folks too!

We didn’t recognize it at first, but when we looked it up, we found it’s tied to a white supremacist organization.

We were outraged and honestly disgusted. I’d equate it to someone walking around with a swastika on their hat — it felt that blatant and hateful.

Here’s what I’d love Reddit’s opinion on:
What should we have done in that moment? Said something? Told the baristas? Ignored it to avoid escalation?

It’s been bothering both of us all day — the idea that this person felt so comfortable wearing that in public, especially in that specific business, just feels wrong.

i have a friend with an owala and i always take it and drink it because i love that waterbottle it keeps the water so cold and the straw is nice and wide so i figured that i could buy my own owala, make coffee in the morning and put it in there, and once im done with my coffee rinse it out at school and refill it with water. 

i understand that possibly just rinsing with water it may not get the coffee flavor out but i figured washing it regularly for sure would. so i asked chatgpt and it said that i should be fine, i can refill it with water at school and it'll taste fine but i should be actually washing it as well. 

but my mom thinks i would need to bleach it after coffee since its metal, or else the coffee smell/flavor would stay in there

shes lowk pessimistic and ok this is rude but shes often just wrong about stuff and won't admit it or like even consider that her thought isn't 100% correct so im iffy on taking her advice, especially bcs chatgpt was so sure that it would be fine and im not seeing anything else online saying that there would be an issue

* **Total budget**

* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**
 
 I’d prefer to buy new but I’m open to used as well.
 
* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
 
 Not a huge deal. It will mostly stay home or occasional trips to the library or coffee shop
 
* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
 
14-16
 
* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 
 
 N/A
 
* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**
 
Probably not, but if anything it would be the Sims
 
* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 
 Good keyboard for sure. I don’t really care for touch screen laptops and would probably prefer it did not have that. Also I like clicky keyboards more than the soft ones, if that makes sense? Touchpad quality also doesn’t matter too much because I almost always use a mouse anyway.

I was intrigued but the price was a little steep. $30 for a 12 pack of 16 oz cans. Which is pretty normal price for a case of energy drinks but that’s also why I don’t buy them lol. We gave in and ordered one. I was expecting it to be similar to BANG’s Miami Cola or something along those lines but it pretty much tastes exactly like Diet Coke. Not Coke Zero, not any other Diet Cola, but specifically Diet Coke flavor. I do occasionally drink Diet Coke but would def prefer Coke Zero. So if you’re a fan of Diet Coke you would love these. 

I would get them again. $30 for 12 is about $2.50 per can which I usually do purchase 2 Welch’s Grape Ghosts for $5 at Walgreens here and there as a treat lol.

So the last couple of days I been drinking these instead of coffee in the morning. To me it’s way better than Miami Cola. I did not like that and I tried to like it so many times lol. I’m a huge cola, root beer, Dr. Pepper flavored things fan from the soft drinks to the candy. But all I usually drink is Waterloo, Polar, Topo Chico sparkling waters so this is as close to soda I will get lol. Now I wanna try regular JOLT because it’s been a while.

*Conrad*

I didn’t see Agnes the next day. I figured she might be busy again. But she also didn’t leave any messages, which was quite unusual, considering she was practically pestering me since I came back from Brussels.

The day after, I bumped into the first year who works with Agnes in GS at the cafeteria. 

“Hey man, what’s up?”, I said while grabbing my coffee order next to him.

“Hey Conrad, been better man, GS is driving me crazy”

“Yeah Agnes mentioned how busy you guys were”

“Yeah man, no wonder she collapsed yesterday. Everyone was shocked”

I stood there, frozen. I didn’t understand.

“What do you mean she collapsed?”

“Oh lord, you don’t know? She was in surgery yesterday when she fainted. She was so pale, they took her straight to the ER. Thankfully it wasn’t anything serious, she was just dehydrated and needed rest”

My heart started to pound and I couldn’t think straight.

“How is she now? Where is she? Do you know on which floor and the room number?”

“They moved her to the private ward I think, she’s fine don’t worry, they’ve just sedated her so she could sleep - otherwise you know she can be…”

“Thanks man”, I quickly said and sprinted to the lifts. I felt weird, I had this sudden panic and I was so disappointed in myself for not having checked on her earlier. As the lift doors opened, I literally ran across the corridors to the private ward. I arrived at the entrance, trying to catch my breath as I frantically looked for her. 

She was there, with an IV, all curled up like she was on the sofa last time and the blanket partly covering her face. I smiled again - it was definitely another of her weird habits.

I quickly looked at her patient chart hanging on her bed and read through her report - thankfully everything looked fine - just dehydration and fatigue as the first year said. I  then looked at my watch and realized I was late for outpatient appointments - I was doing my rotation in the Gynecology department at that time - so I quickly looked at her at her report again, memorized the dosage to work out by when she would be awake and dashed to the ground floor for the appointments.

A few hours later, I rushed back to the private ward, to find her awake and sitting on the bed, frowning at her phone.

“You’re awake”

“Apparently yes. They kept me asleep for 10 hours, can you imagine? I’ve missed so many important surgeries”

“Well, you needed it. Otherwise you wouldn’t have had this dramatic fall. Was so loud that everyone from OBGYN heard it”

She sighed. She wasn’t buying into my jokes this time.

“What’s wrong?”, I said, slowly approaching her

“I just received a message a few minutes before you came.. They’ve put me on mandatory leave for a week..”

“Oh.. maybe that’s good though, I feel like you need it”

“I don’t”

“Weren’t you the one who talked me through why I wasn’t ready when I got fired in my first year?”

She rolled her eyes and made a grin.

“Well this time, you need to be mindful of your health. They wouldn’t ask you to take the week off if they didn’t think you needed it. Especially considering how understaffed they are at the moment”

“You’re right”, she said, sighing softly. “But what am I going to do, I can’t just stay at home, it’ll drive me insane. My parents are away as well next week - talk about perfect timing”

That week, I was going to be in Cousins. Laurel wanted to do a get together and invited over some friends as we hadn’t all met for a long time. Jeremiah was coming. I heard Belly was coming too. 

“Do you want to come with me to Cousins?”, I said, looking at her. She was visibly shocked.

“I mean, there’s a gathering with some family and friends, and I would love for you to meet Laurel. And finally see the beach house”

Agnes remained silent for a few seconds, and then said “Are you sure?”

“Yes, and it might help you recharge as well, you never know. Think about it, you don’t have to decide now. I’m leaving in 2 days, no pressure”, I said, smirking.

Agnes let out a giggle and said, “Alright then, why not?”",1,1762042498.0,tsitp,3,0.56,False

I work in Oak Lawn. I frequent a 7/11 a block away from work for coffee in the morning or beer for after work. The other day when I pulled up I noticed a young man in his young early 20s, homeless. 

Went in, grabbed a 12 pack, paid and walked back to my car. I felt something spark inside me and I walked back to this young man and gave him the cash I had in my wallet, $30. Told him to please get a hot meal and to stay warm. 

Fast forward to today. Swung by to grab a twelver and noticed this young man again but this time there was another young man with him. Turned out it was his younger brother. 22 and 21 years old. 

I asked them why they’re out here in the cold, what happened. They said their mother is a heavy drug addict and their father is in assisted living. I immediately felt the need to do something. To help. 

I told them to immediately follow me back inside and to grab whatever they want. They each grabbed a hot item from the hot box. I told them to grab another and also a drink and some snacks. Got them some donuts for some sweets as well. 

The appreciation these young men showed touched me to my very core. I told them that if I pull up and they’re there, I will get them a meal. I also said I hope I never have to. 

They thanked me and we went on with our day. 

This was 4 hours ago and I haven’t stopped thinking about those young men. Shit. They’re boys to me. 21 and 22 are still children in my eyes. My heart breaks. I feel the need to do more. 

How can I do more? What should I do? Where can I bring these boys so they can get out of the cold and consistent meals? Please. Help me help these boys. I need suggestions. My heart hurts immensely and I feel compelled to help them. ",63,1762042276.0,AskChicago,6,0.94,False

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",4,1762042234.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False

(I know I did.) It’s like a place to put things down for a while. You can use a jar, a box, even a basket, or an old coffee can if that’s what you’ve got handy. The point isn’t what it looks like. It’s that you have somewhere safe to put the fears, worries, resentments, even an urge that’s pulling at you. You can keep one at home, and if you want, make a mini version for when you travel. It’s a reminder that you don’t have to carry everything all the time. That you can apply the KISS method. (Keep It Simple, Silly!)

Whenever something starts weighing on your heart, write it down. A worry, a fear, a frustration, even an urge to escape, numb out, or control something you can’t**.** Scribble it on a scrap of paper, fold it up, and drop it in the jar. It doesn’t have to be neat or poetic. It just has to get out of your head and land somewhere else.

There’s something powerful and cathartic about that. When you write it down, you give your brain a break. You’re not ignoring the feeling or pretending it isn’t real. You’re simply saying, “I don’t have to hold this all by myself right now.”

This is also a gentle reminder of something we all forget: we don’t control the universe or other people. But we do get to choose how we respond and react. We control what we carry and what we let go.

If you want, come back to the jar in a few hours, days, or weeks and look at what you wrote. You can ask yourself:

Do you still feel the same? Does it still hurt as much? 

Some things might still tug at you. Others might feel lighter or even gone. This whole thing is a practice in letting go and learning how to process our emotions. 

Letting go matters because it gives your mind and heart room to breathe. When we hold on to things like anger, guilt, or resentment, it’s like carrying around a backpack full of bricks. You can do it for a while, but it wears you down. When you finally set it down, even a little bit, you make space for peace, clarity, and things that actually help you heal.

Letting go doesn’t mean you’re saying what happened was okay. It just means you’re choosing not to let it control you anymore. It’s choosing hope over being stuck in the same loop. And the more we practice it, the more we learn to make healthier decisions, trust ourselves again, and move forward. You got this!

We don't plan on doing a drink package because neither of us is a big drinker, aside from coffee and water.  Is coffee available throughout the day?  Or just at breakfast? I also love flavored creamers.  Do they have these available?

In room, I've read that you can get ice, there is a fridge, a tv with limited programming...  What else should I know?

I think we have a plan for Nassau, but I'm unsure of what to do at Celebration Key or Bimini.  I do love the water, but don't just sit still and do nothing well.  I like to keep busy.

Dining? I would love to do the main dining room a couple of times at least.  What are the best nights for this?  And the best alternate dining options that are included?  Should I bring my own snacks for late night munching or are there snacks available? 

The water slide, will it chew up my swimsuit?  Should I bring an old suit for the water slide and a new one for lounging or swimming?

Does the ship provide towels for swimming or the beach or should I bring my own?

So many questions!  Any info is appreciated and if you are cruising at the same time, give me a holler!

I'm someone who drinks alcohol frequently, drinks coffee fairly regularly, takes NSAIDs often when I feel discomfort, usually eats heavy meals, smokes hookah, and I deduce that I've eaten foods I'm intolerant to (one of them is eggs), and I suppose my stomach got tired of me. First, they diagnosed me with colitis, I took a break, felt better, went back to my normal life, and got sick again. After more than a month in that situation, I decided to get a colonoscopy and endoscopy. From the biopsy of the samples they took, they diagnosed me with mild chronic superficial active gastritis. I'm already mentally prepared that it'll be a few months of diet.

The thing is, the symptoms I see in a lot of people, I don't have. My stomach doesn't hurt when I eat, I've only had a bit of heartburn twice in all this time. Although sometimes I feel a bit nauseous or dizzy, I feel my stomach bloated after eating and sometimes I feel full, difficulty burping, difficulty going to the bathroom (I have to strain a lot and what I expel isn't much) despite there being a lot of intestinal movement, and basically that's it.

The title is what it is because I don't know if those symptoms are more common than I think, but since I've seen that most of the typical symptoms I haven't felt, I feel pretty lost with the whole thing. Anybody that could help me?

As he's unwrapping it it's THE MOST beautiful bacon egg and cheese we've ever seen. 

I've lived in Astoria since 1998- I've had my share of BEACSPK- this one was B-E-A-utiful. 

Anyway, hubby and I debated on asking him where he got it from. Exchange went a bit like this:
Me: babe look at that bacon egg and cheese
Husband: that looks great
M: d...do we ask him where he got it?
H: no that's weird
M: hear me, what if I say it's a pregnancy craving?
H: not even pregnant 
M: Shhhhh.....none of us know that
H: what?!
M: do. We. Ask. Him?!

In the end we didn't ask cause we're cowards. 

FAST FORWARD I was washing clothes over at the spot across from the McDonald's under the train, and I walk over to toast and roast for a BEACSPK and I had to contain myself in the shop. But I immediately texted him at work like BITCH I FOUND IT! 

And now I'm a regular when I do my laundry if I have the coins to spare if not I get my butter roll and coffee from Parisi. 

Figured I'd share the love since I've seen so many posts about them recently lol",13,1762041581.0,astoria,9,0.78,False
1om2yo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1om2yo8/where_do_i_begin/,where do I begin?,"I am exhausted. Being married to a narcissist is not for the weak…

For context, I am 23F with 2 under 2 children. I am also a veteran married to a LE officer. Ever since I left service, I have been a stay at home mom. 

Ever since I found out I was pregnant with my first baby, my husband changed. It was like a switch went off…

Before having children, we were such a great couple. We were happy. We had talked about marriage and children down the line and knew we wanted to experience it all together. Although it happened quicker than expected, I had anticipated my husband, boyfriend at the time, to be excited. He was not.

Throughout my first pregnancy, my husband started “developing” anger issues. I was (still am) constantly walking on eggshells, apologizing for everything, attempting to make everything perfect for him because if it wasn’t - it ruined the whole day. It could even be a matter of if his coffee was too cold or he didn’t have breakfast to eat, it was always my fault / taken out on me.

I tend to trust me intuition, and I had a hunch I needed to check his phone. He is very territorial over his phone and won’t let me randomly use it- even to change a song. Yes, I know- terrible. However I did, and sure enough I found text messages about to his female coworker talking about my pregnancy. He told the her he is dreading taking me maternity clothes shopping and that I’m getting too excited. He also told her statistically, we will end up divorced anyways. When i found these messages, i was 3 weeks postpartum with my first baby. When I confronted him, he insisted that “wasn’t who he was anymore” and he was foolish. I chose to believe him… even though I was still dealing with his anger issues. To this day he still does not want me seeing his phone. 

In the hospital after having both our babies, never once did I hear “I’m proud of you” or anything encouraging during childbirth. No real smiles or tears during his children’s births. Nothing. Just complaints about how he couldn’t sleep on the couch in the hospital room and making me scoot over in my hospital bed so he could sleep next to me ( 2 time c section mom here). He kept complaining and saying that we wanted to leave early… I was fine staying in the hospital for the 3-4 days but he insisted we left earlier so he could sleep in our bed at home.

During my second baby’s birth, same thing. But this time I was fishing for a compliment… I asked, “well, are you proud of me?” in response I got, “yeah.” I said, “do you think I did a good job? are you happy?” “Sure”.  Same thing… we only stayed 2 nights. 

When I was 1 week postpartum with my second baby, I could barely get out of bed. I needed assistance and I would get nauseous standing up and down to get the baby. Around 11PM, I woke up my husband and asked if he could change our baby and hand her to me so I could feed her. He dramatically sighs, puts her on the changing table. She is crying, as a newborn baby does- and my husband gets so frustrated he screams, drops down to his knees and repeatedly slams his head into the floor. I am absolutely horrified at this behavior so I jump up holding my stomach and rush to my baby. My husband crawls into bed and falls right back asleep- mumbling complaints and curse words as he drifts off.

Here I am almost 9 months later after my second baby. No real progress on the marriage. I have told him many times I am not happy in this marriage. Instead of taking accountability, he always finds a way to pin the blame of his behavior on me. “I wouldn’t act this way if you hadn’t…” “well if you did ___ I wouldn’t have been upset this morning” “well you just never want to have s*x with me anymore so that’s why I’m angry” 

He has told me he will make my life a living hell if I try to divorce him. He said he would k*ll himself if I left him. I have given him all sorts of outs and benefits to divorce. I told him I wouldn’t tell a soul about how he treated me . I wouldn’t tell his parents. If we just had a peaceful divorce I wouldn’t fight. He told me he would fight me in court for as long as it would take. 

And it’s ALWAYS, “you know you aren’t abused. You make it seem so much worse than it is”

I once told him that some women have never been yelled at by their husbands. and to that he said well sucks for you but they aren’t us.

There’s no escape. I’m just a broke stay at home mom. He won’t let me leave. I am absolutely sick. And to add to all this- I genuinely believe he does not enjoy being a father or a husband. When we are around other people, it’s like a brand new husband. He’s tossing the kids around and playing, holding my youngest. Telling my in laws about the kids like he knows them. But whenever we leave, he wants nothing to do with them. Which makes me think divorce isn’t the option because what will my young babies do when they need a parent and I’m not there? Will they just sit there waiting for attention while he sits on his phone? On his mornings or days off, he’s always on his phone. I have to ask him for his help. And if I don’t ask him exactly what I need him to do in perfect detail, he won’t do it. For example, if I were to ask him to, “do the dishes” he would empty out the dishwasher and not put the dirty dishes sitting in the sink in the dishwasher. I say, “hey why didn’t you put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher” “well you didn’t tell me to” 

There’s so much more. However, I feel like I’ve been going through this for so long, my mind is erasing the memories. I can’t remember much of my babies childhood and they are still very young. My mind is trying to protect me and erase the memories he corrupted. 

I fantasize about what it would be like to have a nice husband. One who never yells. Who gives me affection without expecting s*x in return. Who enjoys being a father. Someone who is present. I’m not proud to say this, but I often think about other men I know and wonder if they would be sweet to me. Proud of the woman I am. Not yell at me in public. 

Before I get hate in the comments please know this: I love my children and I wouldn’t have given them up for the world. I wish our circumstances were different and I wish I broke the cycle. But I am doing the best I can and protecting them how I think is best. They will always have me. 

Maybe one day I will be loved. Until then, I’ll be here protecting my children and watching them grow into beautiful humans.

I am in the first trimester of my first pregnancy (10 weeks) so far everything has been developing normally.  I’m 32 years old, relatively healthy though have allergy induced asthma and my vitamin D, b-12, and iron levels fluctuate between healthy and very low.  I feel very paranoid at times that certain things I do may impact the fetal development but also find certain recommendations to be too hard to follow.  For example, as soon as I found out, I cut way down on caffeine and am down to half a cup of coffee.  I tried to stop all together a few times and ended up with a horrible headache that I can’t do anything about because I can’t take pain relievers or drink herbal tea. I also have had a lot of food aversions and am struggling to eat eggs, meat, and a lot of veggies. I’m worried about not getting enough protein.  Snacking has been ok because it’s mostly been fruit but meals have not been the best (Mac and cheese, grilled cheese, chicken nuggets, oatmeal) essentially what a picky toddler.  I want to eat healthy and limit process foods but processed foods are giving me less aversions than the good stuff.  And for exercise including Pilates and strength training, I hear so many mixed messages because I know regular, low impact exercise is recommended but then I also hear that certain movements are not good for pelvic floor or whatever else.  I want to exercise and be as healthy as I can but I don’t want to do anything that could make things worse for the baby and me.  Last of all (at least for now 😂) I thankfully have always been a side sleeper but have found myself waking up on my stomach or back at times AND IT FELT SO COMFY.  I also understand those positions are not recommended but what can I do if I can’t control it? I have family and friends I could turn to for advice but my husband and I agreed it would be best to wait until 12 weeks after we’ve had genetic testing.  For those who have been pregnant before or are much further along than myself, what did you take seriously? Was there anything you let slide? And if you feel comfortable sharing, I’d also love to know the outcome of your experience either way.  Thank you for your responses and for letting me rant. ",1,1762041357.0,pregnant,4,1.0,False

It’s called **GoodNutritions**, and it’s an AI-powered food & health tracker that helps you *understand what you eat*, not just count calories.  
You can:  
✅ Snap a photo of your food for instant calorie & nutrient breakdowns  
✅ Scan barcodes or food labels  
✅ Track water, coffee, and smoking  
✅ Get smart food alternatives  
✅ See personalized health insights  
✅ And everything is **100% free,** no subscriptions, no paywalls

I’d love to hear what kind of features *you’d* want in a health or calorie tracking app, especially from a design or functionality perspective.

1om2slr,https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/1om2slr/is_victoria_too_outdoorsy/,Is Victoria too outdoorsy?,"I've been in Victoria now a majority of my life. I love the mountains and oceans. I love the view and the weather. It's genuinely a beautiful city. 

During my stay here, I've observed what I can only call a ""loss of culture"". It's lost a lot of it's charm, and I understand that things change with time. I also know these things change through the silent consensus of culture of our everyday lifestyles. 

Its likely my own observational bias, that perhaps I don't get out enough. However, I just don't seem to cross paths with people who have any rich personality anymore. Victorians, on average, claim to be outdoorsy. This means to own a dog that spends it's 9 to 5 in your condo, going for a walk at 7pm and a longer walk on weekends around Thetis lake, the lagoon, or some slightly longer adventure up island in your leased truck/suv. 

This outdoorsy lifestyle is fueled by expensive coffee, unneeded & generic MEC gear, highlighted through curated clean girl aesthetic Instagram posts, copy and paste, ad nauseam. 

However, I know that these same people had, and still hold onto, uniqueness and interesting things. Garages and storage units full of interesting cultures and perspectives that they've brought with them from various areas of Canada or a variety of countries around the world. Once living in Victoria, this uniqueness is packed up over time, squished and squeezed from its host slowly. The curse of quiet judgment ricochets off the edges of the water surrounding three sides of the city, only to be capped by the national park & mountains above it. A closed loop.

It's this locked pool of people who reverberate this west coast freeze within it, that seemingly maintains the melting pot process at a slow, but steady rate. Like a frog slowly coming to a boil in a contained pot; most people operate fairly lonely in the city and in an act of performativeness, shed what's unique and interesting about them. Traded in exchange for the guise of outdoorsy. Or worse, they exchange it for masked alcoholism disguised as an interest in fine wines and low-production alcohols. Too many breweries. 

Its taken me longer than average to feel burned by this. Everyone in Victoria has a friend, who moved here and couldn't make it a whole year, before being chewed up by the city, having to move away. I've managed to get nearly 20 years here now, but I now know the feeling, as these doubts have finally begun brewing in the back of my mind.

I would like to hear loud, stinky, cars again. I'd like to see a factory with a smoke stack and some grumpy workers smoking out front. I'd like to see a big empty parking lot with cracks in the pavement. It would be nice to see a run down chain restaurant that no one goes to. I'd like to see still, dark and stale pockets of urban space. These unattractive areas, serve and important function, but are constantly cleaned up. Insert your own examples of real human moments here.

The city is truly missing a middle class right now, it's missing places for the mundane, irrelevant and melancholy. Instead, those who operate in that wealth bracket have packed all that up, took it home to their condo and installed it into their Jysk living rooms, to play out indoors, in private. It's left the streets for only the rich who can afford to fraternize, and the desolate who are too poor to hide. Why are you so boring? Why are you afraid to be interesting? Why do you protest the patriarchy by white washing it further with more bike lanes and dog parks? Why do you promote green living by saving money at Costco, and never trying to barter? Where did all the punks go?

Reddit isn't the right crowd for this post, but long dead are the anonymous, real or digital, forums to think out loud. I am just venting. ",0,1762040959.0,VictoriaBC,36,0.24,False

Meditation is when you sit still, and try to focus on your breath, eventually you’ll get distracted, but the whole point is to become aware and bring your focus back to your breath. It’s like training a muscle, but in your brain, your attention. 


At first I tried it by itself, and it was very hard, mentally painful, and I didn’t make much progress. So I decided to add some stuff right before it so I can focus better, I worked out (ran 2.5 miles in 30 minutes), I drank coffee, and I got 12 hours of sleep on that day.

When I got in, I entered in a quite data entry-focused role and didn’t realise that it wasn’t the best fit for me. Nevertheless, I stayed since I did my work well/alright. However, the past months I’ve also been thinking about finding a path which is more aligned with my studies, and something which is more advisory-focused rather than data entry. We work closely with the larger/higher up risk department, where I’ve been lately quite close with the senior managers. My conversations with them on specific tasks have been so insightful, and I also always had a feeling that I could grow in their department more and really specialise in a field more aligned with what I want as a career.

Two weeks ago, I finally bit the bullet and had an hour long coffee with one of their senior managers. He was happy to hear that I was interested in my department and indicated that he’d think I’d be a good fit, but that I’d need to talk to the head of the department to see if there’s space since they don’t have an active listing. Last Tuesday, the head called me out of the blue and asked me Monday to discuss with him my career options there.

Now I’m quite nervous on how to go about this coffee/exploratory meeting. I’d really love to move to their department, since I know long term growth is better there and they’re doing quite intensive work which I find interesting. Any tips on how to go about this? ",1,1762040517.0,work,0,1.0,False

But nothing really happened, we just parted as friends after 1.5 weeks.

He returned home to Toronto and I back to Antwerp, we exchanged numbers but because of the time different I didnt thing anything would happen even though I was very attracted to him.

Fast forward few weeks,he started to flirt with me and I flirted back and we started sexting(a first for me!) and having facetime and call each other on our way to work sometimes he would call me ""just to chat"" while cooking. I kept saying to myself this may not lead to somewhere so just be chill and not have too many expectations but.. he was so consistent. He send me photo of his morning coffee with his smiling face (sometimes making funny face) EVERY SINGLE MORNING.

We watched movies together by sharing screen, talked late into the night. I never texted so much since I was in high school (and yes sexting part was great too, we even got long distance controlled toys) and I felt so safe and relaxed with him. We havent really put a name though and honestly as someone who just got out of a long term relationship(he was also recently divorced) I was happy having a 'special friend' that I can have long chats with but also orgasms haha. He jokingly called himself my canadian boyfriend few times, which I reacted warmly and positively but by keeping the joke. I bought him concert tickets for his birthday and he bought me an art work I mentioned I loved when I moved to a new appartment as a house warming gift for me.

Anyways 5 months later.... first thing that disappeared was his morning at work with coffee selfies.. I immediately noticed and asked about it and he said something like he has been busy in the morning. So I didnt wanna be overbrarinf and kinda backed down and didnt ask again but it just completely stopped.

And later came the shorter replies like ""looks good"" ""sounds cool"" ""enjoy!"" ""Okay"" He stopped building up on our conversations and just started reacting to things I say. Soon enough I started to feel like I was talking to myself, and I asked about this to him and he said ""Oh I am so sorry, I wasnt aware I was doing that. I am just trying to respond fast"" but nothing changed.

And then he stopped texting first. He stopped asking about my day. He stopped flirting or iniating sexting. This time I just straight up asked him ""are you drifting away? Is this thing between us coming to an end?"" and he said ""awww sweetie ❤️ ofcourse not!"" but... you guessed it.. nothing changed.

It has been 5 weeks of this now and I dont know what to do. How to move away from someone who is I guess was a 'situationship'

It would be easy if he just told me he got bored or long distance is hard and he found someone close by.. I would be OK.

Well not OK, but I would move on. But now I am in a limbo.. cause he STILL replies to me almost within minutes of me texting him but the version of him that responds is like a faded version of the person I know and makes no effort to build conversation.

Like I send him a photo from my trip to Paris and all his reactions was ""beautiful"" ""awesome"" ""looks fun!"" Whereas the person I knew before would ask questions and just.. interact with me.

What is the best way to deal with this?

TLDR at bottom.

Hey everyone, I’ve been struggling with this for a while and I don’t know if it’s time to call this off or if I’m overreacting. 

My girlfriend and I have been dating for 6 months.
Anyway, last year she was the victim of a car accident and received a settlement of about $20,000. 

She finally received the settlement in early July, and decided to quit her job to focus on getting her self-made business up and running. 
I was immediately worried that this was a mistake and thought if I were in the same position, I’d still be working full-time (or at least part time) while putting energy in to the business. 20k isn’t a lot to live on for very long.

She wants to run an astrology/tarot reading business as well as offer services in styling and personalized makeup based off the persons chart orientation.

I’m not super in to astrology but I’ve seen a lot of people on TikTok that have done well enough with it and I think she has a bit of a niche because of the “witchier” spin she puts on it.

Now, the problem is, the people on TikTok doing this have 10k+ followers, and they offer a multitude of services. While she has maybe 800 followers.

She created some business cards to pass out at local coffee shops and metaphysical stores, but I feel that she needs a huge surplus in followers, and her services are typically limited to only a one time transaction per customer. There’s not a lot of ability for repeat customers. 

She has some opportunities with local events, and a possible (extremely limited employment) at a crystal shop doing readings, maybe twice per month. And some ideas on running a collaboration business with some of our other friends. But the issue isn’t as pressing for them so there isn’t a sense of urgency

She’s running out of money, and I’m noticing some resentment starting to build, because I’m quickly becoming the sole provider, monetarily speaking.
She has disclosed to me that a lot of the arguments she got in with her ex were due to her not working, so this is a pattern. 

A few weeks ago she disclosed to me that she was worried about becoming homeless, and losing out on everything because of her business not working out.
Instead of “I’m worried that I’ll have to go back to a 9-5” this was the sentiment.

She has become really good friends with a lot of people in my group, and they see the two of us together as a really happy couple, and really this is the only issue that we have. Everything else is solid, but I don’t want to dismiss my goals and end up in a provider role for her, especially if she is choosing to not find a job.

I’m worried breaking up is going to cause a huge rift in my group, but I’m more worried about staying in a position where I’m forced to leave when she runs out of money in a month or two. 
I want her to be safe and well, but this idea she has clearly has some fallacies.


TLDR: girlfriend quit her job to start a business, chose to live off a settlement that is quickly dwindling, business isn’t moving, and I am uneasy about the future of the relationship due to her idea about finding regular work.",2,1762040333.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

Your birthday party was great, got to meet your boyfriend for the first time, he was lovely and sweet, great, I couldn’t even look him in eyes, in case he got the wrong idea, that I liked him, in case you got the wrong idea, that I liked him, because the only one I like is you. And so he spun you as we played a game of granny, and I made sure to spin you as I held you waist, as I clapped your back, as I laughed about an incident in Amsterdam he would never get, because it was only ours, because only you and I have that dynamic. But even then you went to him as the game simmered down. I went up to the bar and brought everyone a shot, how generous, oh yes, never mind that I wanted to kill him and then myself, some vodka was overdue. And I saw, his arms around your waist and you looking up at him, your voice so sweet and warm, because he was your man, the man you’d kissed, the man you’d lost your virginity to, the one you talked about as you called me in a coffee shop while I was trying to charge my dying computer. Because you two had just had sex, and I needed to know that I would never receive such grace from you, not your body, but your heart, that vulnerability, the allowance of seeing that part of you, but never with me, no never with me. But I remember that karaoke room half a year ago when Katy party was singing “to good to deny it” and you screamed over the music that you “really wanted to kiss me right now” and I screamed back “me too” and then continued to sing like I hadn’t thrown the ball off the court so far I couldn’t even run to retrieve it from the trenches, and I think about that day, what if, oh what if. I thought about it right after saying “me too”. What if. But that’s all we are, all we’ll ever be.",0,1762040186.0,UnsentLetters,1,0.5,False

Since then I've just made drip coffee (Moccamaster) until recently. I've recently started experimenting with Chemex on weekends, making about 24 oz. coffee at a time.  

The MDF is a 50 mm flat burr.   It's not fancy but it's a tank.   But I've started to wonder if a newer grinder  would be a noticable improvement in performance over a 15 year old grinder (although it still works fine).  After watching a Hoffman youtube video, I was looking at the DF54 or Baratza Encore ESP pro or similar.  Anyone upgraded from an MDF to something they liked better.  The burrs in the DF54 are only 4 mm bigger, but maybe different/newer geometry?  For what it's worth, I typically like medium roast Central/South American coffees that have nutty or chocolatey notes, although a few Ethiopian coffees that are raspberry/blueberry fruit forward have been enjoyed at times (but I've never been able to get these consistently).  I appreciate any input if someone has made a similar switch.  ",2,1762039923.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

Quick update + what’s new:

TL;DR

•	We’re formalizing the addition of four additional folks into leadership to share the load. Suffice to say we greatly underestimated the response and now realize we need to be growing everything much more rapidly, so we have some folks we’ve tapped on the shoulder, and we will be finalizing this coming week.

•	Two doors (same as before):

o	The Collective = invite-only “deep end” lab.

o	The Course Collective (school) = free, open, beginner friendly.

•	If you DM, tell us which door you want and include the 5 bullets under How to Join. It speeds things up a ton.

•	Only DMs from me (u/FreedomChipmunk47) or u/Current-Damage2165 are official. Anyone else saying they rep us… doesn’t. People may try- Tell them to go shit in their hat.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

What we’re building (fast recap)

A creator-run lab: part Discord, part studio, part refuge. Share methods, test tools, swap retention tricks, workshop thumbnails/scripts, and give/receive honest feedback: minus the “AI doesn’t count” noise.

A School where you can level up your game. Once you have leveled that game up, it’s a place where you can teach or develop a specialization by leaning into something. We plan on offering many different opportunities to learn inside the school for free, all the time.

Troll Free Environment. No, Really!

No fees, no gotchas. When a paid course eventually exists, it’ll be optional and announced openly after we’ve proved value for free, out in the open.

Space on this pirate ship. We already have some of the most exciting people in the industry inside, and we want more! This past week has been more intellectually stimulating for me than the last 5 years!

We are going to do this like a music scene. We support each other. We go to each other’s shows. We engage with one another’s content. We always watch until the end.  We are not talking “Sub for Sub,  man..” We are talking about real honest engagement and feedback from other people who also know what they are doing and can give you ideas that you might not have ever thought of. We all rise together and rise we will.

A Lot of things in the works that should lift us all up since we are the beginning of the biggest revolution in Art of the Century. This isn’t a wave coming, it is a thousand-foot Tsunami. Sink or swim time, and trolls live under bridges.

Yeah, I know that last sentence sounded like ChatGPT but I swear to God I wrote it myself- Look ma no emdashes

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

New: The Board

We’re adding a few trusted folks to keep the wheels on and the vibes good. We have plans to meet with these folks all together this coming week. We have a lot of balls in the air, and if these folks agree, that should give us the help we need to keep from dropping any of them.

•	Intake & Onboarding – triage DMs, place folks in the right space, keep it humane.

•	Curriculum & “Lesson of the Day” – collect the best tips, turn them into bite-size dailies in the school.

•	Showcase & Feedback Loops – weekly critique circles; “what moved the needle?” reports.

•	Prompt and Tool Lab & Demos – structured tests of Sora/Veo/Leo/etc. (prompts, seeds, failures, wins).

•	Community Health – code of conduct, conflict de-escalation, troll filters.

•	Analytics & Monetization – retention ladders, shorts vs. longform strategies, affiliate stacking without being gross.

•	AI Creator Collective website Yes, we bought the dot ai domain, and we plan on using it to promote everyone in the Collective, and well as The Students in the school.

•	 An AICC YouTube Channel. Converted an old channel of mine that’s just been sitting empty for 6 months. We will use this for everyone’s benefit as well. Yes trolls, including monetization. Building out all the other platforms as well.

•	We’ve got a lot of other things going on that I could add but I should get permission first. Maybe I’ll tell you about those later 😊

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Two doors (same mission)

1. The Collective (invite-only)

For folks comfortable with the tools, able to share WIPs, failures, and analytics in a high-trust room. Not about sub counts: it’s about mindset and contribution.

2) The Course Collective (school) : FREE, open

Beginner-friendly. Daily “Lesson of the Day,” prompt clinics, safe feedback, zero trolling. The course will come later; meanwhile the school stays free and keeps growing.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

How to join (copy/paste this in your DM)

Subject: Joining Collective or Course Collective (pick one)

1. Your experience level (be real)
2. What you’re making (channels or examples)
3. What you want to learn in the next 30 days
4. What you can contribute (feedback, editing tricks, music, prompts, analytics, etc.)
5. Time zone + preferred Pacific Hours for us to get back to you.

Only DM: u/FreedomChipmunk47 or u/Current-Damage2165

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

What we’re not

•	Not a hustle.

•	Not selling vapor.

•	Not a “trust me bro” mastermind.

•	Not a place where people punch down. If you like flinging poo from the bleachers, Reddit already has seating.

Comment or DM to jump in. If you comment “interested,” please still DM with the 5 bullets so we don’t lose you in the thread. I have no doubt that I left some people  hanging from the last one, but for real, every time I got the DM number down to Zero, and stood up to get coffee, I came back to 5 more, so please forgive if I missed you and DM me because it’s much easier for me to keep track there!

Let’s build the scene we wish we’d found generous, experimental,

and stubbornly troll-proof.

So, I've had a crush on this guy at work for about a month. He's super polite and looks good, even if he's not exactly my usual type.We've mutual friends group we become really good friends with a group of 7-8 of us, always hanging out and having fun together. We all meet up for lunch and coffee. He makes a lot of eye contact with me kinda flirts very rarely. We don't chat much outside of work, but everyone keeps teasing me about him. He gets a little shy and smiles when they do he says ""are nhi nhi"" so i thought he feels the same.

But he's not known for being great with girls. Already one of my friend told me not to expect anything he's not how you think. Today, I couldn't take it anymore and texted him, telling him I had a crush on him. He replied that he already knew. He then told me he's not dating anyone and but he can't make a statementof not talking. He himself said that he's not kinda good guy (he's a good person tho) and said that he do the friends-with-benefits thing for short period.

I recently moved to the UK from India(tamil) to pursue my Master’s degree, and I’m still getting used to the new environment. It’s exciting, but also a bit overwhelming since I don’t really know anyone here yet.

I’d really love to make new friends — especially someone who values kindness, mutual respect, and healthy boundaries. I’m not looking for anything romantic, just hoping to connect with someone (preferably female) who enjoys talking about everyday things, culture, studies, etc.

About me:

Master’s student

Introverted at first but friendly once I know you

I enjoy music, exploring the city, trying new food, and meaningful conversations


Also, I’m not very fluent in English yet, so I used ChatGPT to write this post clearly.

I am 28 and I’ve lived in the same 10 square mile radius my entire life.

I’m an attorney, currently unemployed. I just started my second year of being licensed. So while I’m looking for some place to live, I also don’t have a clear idea of what my budget is yet.

I pretty much only know small town living. I think I’m open to midsize and big cities. I’ve enjoyed and felt safe in places like Pittsburgh, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Pensacola, and Raleigh. I liked Washington DC but frankly, it was the worst driving experience I’ve ever had.

I’ll be moving with my partner (32), two dogs, and four cats. My biggest issue where we live is not just the politics and attitudes of the people around us but how far away everything is from us. 

Goals/ Like to Have: 
15 minute drive or less: grocery store, post office, gas station, restaurants, veterinarian, coffee shop (a good one! Independently owned or local chain), independently owned bookstore, and public library (preferably with places to sit and/ or work). 

25 minute drive or less: more restaurants, museums, gym/fitness that are beginner & fat person friendly, medical (doctor/ dentist, OBGYN, optometrist) a variety of stores preferably locally owned, access to nature (BF loves kayaking).  

I know it’s all traffic dependent and I truly don’t mind driving for some things. I’m just tired of driving 25+ minutes for everything. 

My partner does like smoking weed. I am afraid of huge weather events so minimizing the risk of tornadoes, mudslides, hurricanes, earthquakes, and/or wildfires as much as possible would be great. Partner isn’t sure about living any place that gets too much snow (what that means exactly I’m not sure.) 

My partner is a landscaper and hopes to go back to college for his bachelor’s degree at some point. He hasn’t decided what he wants to study (he’s torn between history and anthropology).

What do you think? What recommendations do you have?  How realistic is my wishlist?

So a bit of a backstory: well Both of my Kids(3&6) are in the same daycare groups as the kids of the family in question. The Kids are not really the Best of the Friends but they have fun playing together. The family in question are quite the cheapskates. They are not doing badly financialy. But there are the little things that really get on my nerves. Like when we are in the park or at the playground and we happen to meet them, they allways assume I will pay for the coffee or provide snacks for the Kids. I cannot say no to the their kids if we have snacks, but I would expect they would bring something with them the next Time, rather than counting on me. One Time a few of us parents decided to throw a group birthday party for a few of the kiddos together and each parent would contribute. So the mom made like a cake, which was bearly large enough to feed the Kids and she asked like $50 for the ingridients. But OK, it is her Time and electricity and so forth. But no way was that even close to $50. The one Time they actually invited us over they made like a hotdog party, and when we asked if we can bring something she said we can bring hotdogs and buns for all. Geez, Thanks...
And on another occcasion when unbeknown to us their youngest kid was beeing potty trained, my wife invited them over to our place, the kid pissed himself twice so there was piss on the floor. Which I get it, not the kid's fault but the mom did not offer to clean up after her kid. We had to do it.
You get the picture, I hope.
Should we cut them off or would it be better to minimise the contact outside of daycare? I guess it would not be fair to the Kids that this things would come in the way of childs play. ",2,1762039044.0,AITAH,2,0.76,False

Both offer fast internet, thriving communities, affordable living, and tropical adventures, but they cater to different nomad lifestyles.

Let’s dive into a detailed comparison to help you choose your next base!

# 🏙️ 1. Cost of Living 💰

|Category|🇻🇳 Vietnam|🇲🇾 Malaysia|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Average monthly budget|$900–$1,200|$1,200–$1,600|
|Apartment (1BR city center)|$350–$600|$500–$800|
|Coffee / Meal|$2–$4|$3–$6|
|Coworking membership|$70–$120|$100–$150|

**Verdict:** Vietnam wins for ultra-budget nomads — especially in Da Nang, Hoi An, or Da Lat. Malaysia offers a slightly higher standard of comfort but at higher cost.

# ⚡ 2. Internet & Infrastructure

* **Vietnam:** 80–200 Mbps Wi-Fi is standard in cafés and coworking spaces. Power cuts are rare but can happen in rural areas.
* **Malaysia:** Outstanding 5G coverage, reliable utilities, and modern coworking hubs (especially in Kuala Lumpur and Penang).

**Verdict:** Malaysia takes the lead in infrastructure quality and consistency.

# 🛂 3. Visa Options for Digital Nomads

|Visa Type|🇻🇳 Vietnam|🇲🇾 Malaysia|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Tourist / e-Visa|30–90 days (online at [evisa.gov.vn](https://thithucdientu.gov.vn/e-visa/foreigners))|90 days visa-free for many countries|
|Long Stay / Nomad Visa|No official “Nomad Visa” yet; business/investor options available|**DE Rantau Nomad Pass** — 12 months, renewable, ideal for remote workers|
|Application Process|Simple online e-Visa form|Online via MDEC (Malaysia Digital Economy Corp.)|
|Cost|\~$25 USD|\~US $220 processing fee + insurance|

**Verdict:** Malaysia clearly wins for visa flexibility — its DE Rantau Nomad Pass is tailor-made for digital nomads.

# ☕ 4. Café & Coworking Culture

* **Vietnam:** Coffee is part of the lifestyle — street cafés everywhere, with great Wi-Fi and creative interiors.
* **Malaysia:** Sleek coworking brands like WORQ, Common Ground, and Colony dominate; slightly more formal vibe.

**Verdict:** Vietnam’s café scene feels more organic and inspiring for freelancers; Malaysia is better for structured business setups.

# 🌴 5. Nature & Lifestyle

|Experience|Vietnam|Malaysia|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Beaches|Da Nang, Phu Quoc, Nha Trang|Langkawi, Perhentian, Tioman|
|Mountains|Da Lat, Sapa|Cameron Highlands|
|Islands|Phu Quoc, Cat Ba|Langkawi, Redang|
|Urban vibe|Bustling scooters & energy|Modern, cosmopolitan calm|

**Verdict:** Vietnam is raw, adventurous, and dynamic. Malaysia is polished, peaceful, and convenient.

# 💳 6. Payment & Everyday Ease

* **Vietnam:** Mostly cashless now, thanks to MoMo and ZaloPay. Still, small markets may require cash.
* **Malaysia:** 100 % cashless in cities — GrabPay, Touch’n Go, and card payments everywhere.

**Verdict:** Malaysia leads in digital convenience.

# 🌐 7. Community & Language

* **Vietnam:** Large expat and remote-worker scenes in Da Nang, Hanoi, and HCMC. English is common in tourist zones.
* **Malaysia:** Even easier — English is an official business language, and communities are international and welcoming.

**Verdict:** Malaysia edges ahead for English fluency and smoother integration.

# 🏠 8. Housing & Comfort

* **Vietnam:** Apartments and coliving spaces are affordable but may vary in quality.
* **Malaysia:** Modern condos with gyms, pools, and security — excellent value for mid-range budgets.

**Verdict:** Malaysia for comfort; Vietnam for cost-efficiency.

# ✈️ 9. Travel & Connectivity

* **Vietnam:** Excellent domestic network, cheap trains and flights, quick access to Thailand and Cambodia.
* **Malaysia:** Major hub (Kuala Lumpur International) — nonstop flights across Asia, Europe, and Australia.

**Verdict:** Malaysia wins for international connectivity.

# ✨ 10. Overall Vibe

|Category|Best Choice|
|:-|:-|
|Budget Nomads|🇻🇳 Vietnam|
|Long-Term Remote Workers|🇲🇾 Malaysia|
|First-Time Nomads|🇲🇾 Malaysia|
|Adventurous Travelers|🇻🇳 Vietnam|
|Business-Focused Expats|🇲🇾 Malaysia|

# 💼 Final Thoughts

Both countries are incredible — it depends on what you value:

* **Choose Vietnam** if you want creativity, chaos, and the most budget-friendly lifestyle in Asia.
* **Choose Malaysia** if you prefer stability, infrastructure, and easy long-term stays under a real Digital Nomad Visa.

💡 **Ideal combo:** Start your journey in Vietnam → transition to Malaysia once you’re ready for longer stays and business-grade comfort.",1,1762038662.0,digitalnomadlife,0,1.0,False

1om1sqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/1om1sqf/my_experience_treating_the_acute_phase_at_home/,My experience treating the acute phase at home,"I will post my personal experience here, maybe it will be useful for someone.
So:

The beginning of the acute phase - August 18 this summer.
Two weeks of discomfort in the right glute and leg preceded the acute phase.
I wasn’t very worried, because two years ago I had the same sensations characteristic of the initial stage on the left side, and the pain went away in 2-3 weeks back then, without special treatment.

This time everything developed similarly.
Pain and discomfort appeared mainly in the mornings after sleep.
In the morning, during breakfast, I massaged my glute on a hard chair, and then during the day I felt discomfort, but quite tolerable.

But on August 18 a crisis happened out of nowhere and for a stupid reason.
I was entering the bedroom and… I tripped over my cat, who unfortunately jumped out from under the bed.

I fell forward on the bed, and while falling, as I think, made an awkward sharp movement with my body and…
A sharp pain in the lower back area, just above the glute, and immediately after that an even sharper pain throughout the entire right leg.
I am lying on the bed where I fell.
I cannot stand up or move, sharp pain and a VERY strong spasm in the glute which radiates pain through the whole leg.

I’m lying.
Trying to move, to get up.
Impossible.
On adrenaline I slide off the bed and crawl on all fours into the next room, where there is a wall bar.
Trying to hold onto it with my hands and pull myself up.
Unsuccessful.
I lie on my back, rest, and crawl back to the bed.
Adrenaline goes away, any movement causes strong pain from the spasm in the glute and lower back.

Back in the bed, I found temporary relief.
There is a chair next to the bed, and the pain became a little weaker if I put my left, healthy leg up on the backrest of the chair.
Any other position sharply increased the pain.

I started thinking what to do.
First thought - relieve the pain a little.
Found Nise tablets in the first-aid kit, my wife brought them.
However, I felt exactly a very strong spasm and thought something like - “this spasm is the cause of the pain, I need to remove it and everything will be fine.”
From muscle relaxants I knew Sirdalud, asked my wife to bring it from the pharmacy.

Clarification
At that moment I didn’t understand at all how serious the situation was and acted assuming - I’ll take a pill, rest and everything will pass.
When my wife brought Sirdalud, she asked - should I turn off the PC on the desk.
Guess what I answered?)
No need.
Now the pill will relieve the spasm and I’ll return to work.
Naivety.

The night passed terribly.
Pain increased when trying to move, I felt strong constant nerve pain from the spasm down the whole leg.
Took Nise and Sirdalud, fell asleep for about 1.5 hours near morning.

The day brought some relief.
In the position I found I could lie still without sharp pain.
Any attempts to move increased the pain.
I lay. I waited. Hoped the tablets would work and I could get up, but decided that this day was the control point.
If next morning I couldn’t get up - I would call for medical help.

That’s what happened.
In the morning of the third day I called doctors to my home.
Two specialists came, checked what medications I was taking, what symptoms I had at that moment.
Showed them how I tried to move.
Verdict - tablets are working, be patient, this does not heal quickly, lie in the position most comfortable for you.
Additionally they recommended Diclofenac injections.

Ok.
I injected Diclofenac that day and the next.
I didn’t feel serious relief.

I studied the internet, consulted (informally) with acquaintances, among whom there are also doctors.
I decided to enhance the treatment effect and take a short course of steroid anti-inflammatory - Dexamethasone.
3 injections.
From the information I got - serious side effects from steroids would not develop from only 3 injections, and acceleration of recovery was possible.

Day 5, first Dexamethasone injection.
I felt the effect within 10-15 minutes.
The muscles in the glute were vibrating and contracting, the spasm became a little less.
Not much - but I was happy with that progress and decrease in the background spasm pain.
The next two injections did not give such a strong effect, but it became slightly better.
Interesting nuance - during this short steroid course metabolism sped up, and together with relief appeared a physical need to eat every 2-3 hours.
I ate - felt better.
Didn’t eat - pain increased.
Body started recovery and demanded resources.
Didn’t matter what food - the main thing was to eat.
In the end I asked my wife to bring oatmeal on schedule - I never thought I could eat so much of it.

First week ended.
Relief came, but… VERY slowly.
Continued trying to move and there was progress, but very little each day.
Switched to Meloxicam injections.
In the middle of the second week I added vitamin injections - Milgamma.
I knew it’s better to start it immediately, but earlier I couldn’t.
During week one I could turn to my side for the injection, on my stomach only for 10-15 seconds. Then a sharp spasm and pain started.
On week two I could stay like that for ~30 seconds - enough for slow Milgamma injection.
At the end of the week I tried to sit at the edge of the bed.
I could, but… not well.
Vertical load caused pain and spasms.
The leg did not straighten when sitting - I had to keep it sideways.

Week 3.
Continued Meloxicam and Milgamma.
Replaced Sirdalud with Midocalm - and it immediately gave an effect comparable to the first Dexamethasone injection.
After the first Midocalm tablet the glute again vibrated from spasm relief.
And importantly - Sirdalud didn’t suit me well.
In minimal dose it didn’t really help.
In maximum dose it helped, but my blood pressure dropped and it felt bad.
Midocalm had no such side effect and I could take it in the maximum daily dose, constantly weakening the spasm (and pain from it).

Also in week 3 I completely revised my diet.
Before that I just ate, now I approached it consciously.
Removed all pure sugar to not provoke inflammation.
Created a diet focused on protein and healthy fats for recovery.
Chicken, cod, eggs, salmon, cottage cheese, rice, boiled potatoes, honey, plain biscuits.
Stopped tea and coffee, switched to warm water.
Ate on schedule every 3.5-4 hours, ensuring constant nutrient supply.
Added Panangin, Mexidol, fish oil capsules.

Progress that week:
In the middle of the week I managed to move within the bed.
I was able to change bed linen by myself.
Moved on all fours, attempts to go faster caused pain.
But it was something already.
Reached the closet with a stick, pulled out clean bedding, and in 30 minutes with 3 rests changed the sheets myself.

At the end of the week I tried traveling to the other side of the apartment, to the bathroom.
Wanted to become independent in this matter)
Plan: crawl to bathroom on all fours dragging one crutch.
Then lean on it and put myself onto the toilet.
Plan… almost worked)
I crawled to the bathroom.
But kneeling in front of the toilet I understood that… maybe with willpower I could push myself up, but what would happen after was a big question.
Any attempt to straighten vertically caused sharp spasm and pain.
Ok. Returned crawling to bed, marking as “success” the fact of visiting another planet - the opposite side of the apartment.

Week 4.
Finished injections.
Meloxicam for 10 days, Milgamma for 12.
Switched to Milgamma pills.
Kept everything else.
Continued developing movement.
First goal - stand up sooner, but after long lying even sitting caused dizziness.
Asked my wife to remove closet door and used it as a long board.
Made an incline from pillows, slowly increased it, put the board on top.
Carefully moved to it and lay on a flat hard surface but with my head more upright.

Made a pulley trainer from improvised materials.
In another room there was a hanging chair, anchor in the ceiling.
Asked to buy a rope, thread it through the anchor and tie a 5kg weight.
Other end of rope and stick were near the bed.
Lay on bed with feet towards “trainer,” wrapped rope around stick and lying down pulled the block to my chin.
Thus I activated shoulders and upper back.

Of course moved legs doing basic exercises - rotation, bending, moving without pain.

Continued diet on schedule.
Made rule - eat ONLY sitting.
Doesn’t matter how, but sit while eating.

At night, to relieve nerve pain and sleep well, took Baralgin tablet.

End of week 4 - first time I stood up, using two crutches.
Stood, walked 3 steps forward and back.
Dizziness remained despite adaptation, but it didn’t matter - it was progress.

Week 5.
Tried continuing standing with crutches.
Leg didn’t fully straighten, spasm still held, but main issue - strong dizziness.
Changed tactic and used a chair like a walker.
Put bent injured leg on it, pushed with healthy leg, leaning on backrest - bingo, I could go to kitchen and bathroom again by myself. On feet)
After a couple days dizziness decreased and I returned to crutches, slowly loading right leg.

End of week 5 - walked across apartment holding crutch just for safety.
Slowly, unsteadily, but did it.

Week 6.
Encouraged by progress, I went outside.
Took crutch for confidence.
Slowly went down stairs, walked through yard, sat in car.
In the seat I felt “at home” and decided to drive.
30 minutes around the block - successful.
Same day left crutch at home and slowly went to nearby store.
Success.
Next day increased distance.
And then lay down again, but for a different reason)
After 1.5 months with no load, leg muscles forgot how to work, and the walks caused huge muscle soreness.
Gave myself a day to rest, eat and recover, then continued walking more and more.

Basically… that’s the whole story.
Since then (another month) I have been gradually increasing load.
Short countryside walk, trip to lake, to the dacha, etc.
I don’t feel fully healthy, but didn’t expect to.
Move carefully to avoid hurting myself again, avoid tripping, avoid sudden movement that can cause relapse.
Nerve almost doesn’t hurt. Sometimes after a long day.
But no pain now.

As for doctors… honestly, I thought about it and realized I'm not very interested in digging into this deeper.
From information I saw two paths:
Diagnostics, surgeries, etc.
Or independent gradual recovery by building muscle corset in problem area.
I prefer the second.
So - swimming, a lot of swimming.
Then exercises without weights - Superman, planks, pull-up bar.
Then weights.
I realistically give myself 6-12 months, no rushing, progressing by feel.
Strengthening muscles there will allow feeling safer and reduce recurrence risk long-term.

Explanation:
I am not a doctor and this is not advice.
This is my personal experience overcoming an acute nerve compression and returning to normal life.
If you have a similar issue, maybe you will find something here to discuss with your doctor and, if approved, use.

Are they possibly re pulling shots without changing the grounds?,"I went and got an “emergency” shot today just to get some caffeine in me. Doing some early shopping, and didn’t want to make my family wait for me to make a coffee. So I went to the Starbucks in Target, to just get a quick shot to hold me over. 🤢 I guess the best way to put it, is that the longer I’ve been making coffee correctly at home; with either my Flair or doing a pour over, the worst Starbucks has tasted?! It was bad! It tasted like watered down strong coffee, not espresso. No where close to what I know espresso to be now… it wasn’t always like this! I used to like Starbucks!
