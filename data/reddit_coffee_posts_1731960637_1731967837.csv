1guh2ma,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1guh2ma/puck_prep_coffee_on_outside_of_basket/,Puck Prep - coffee on outside of basket,"When I'm prepping puck for my La Pavoni (previously used Robot) I notice that coffee is 'stuck' on the outside of the basket after the tamp. This happens regardless of whether I distribute the grinds pre-tamp. 

1. Is this an issue I need to 'tidy' pre brew?
2. Possible cause or fix? Maybe the tamp is a fraction to small, or do I need to tap the sides pre tamp to remove coffee from the edges?
3. I can lightly blow most of it away.

Doesn't seem to have an impact on taste (though it might do and I just don't see the difference as I haven't got one perfectly clean yet)

Cheers

Her interest level has definitely increased as of late. I stayed over the last two dates, and spent the night cuddling fairly intimately, but we have not hooked up yet. The next morning I offered to take her and her roommate to coffee, and it went well. However, I awkwardly hesitated in the car dropping her off, and decided to walk her to her door to make a move, which I did. Unfortunately, her roommate was still in the lobby for some reason and it sort of ruined things with just a quick peck, followed by a tight hug from her. Ever since she’s been distant 

We’ve had a couple awkward “intimate” moments so my question is, did I fumble that bad to warrant a 180 from her, or is she testing my confidence by not replying to me? To be fair she’s not very signaling or communicative at times

Only on a few occasions have I ordered straight espresso and I do not have the same depth of experience and knowledge as I do when it comes to filter. I recently purchased a WPM ZP-1 & and a Profitec GO. I'm using a very simple manual MHW-3 Bomber WDT tool with a Normcore 58.5 naked portafilter that has a 20 gram basket. Am I okay pulling 18 gram shots with this, and is that the reason why I am seeing channeling? I do seem to see less of it with 20 grams, but honestly I'm not wanting to use that much coffee per shot. I'm definitely open to a new portafilter, as this one doesn't feel super satisfying in my machine as it feels a little tight and somewhat an odd fit. Also open to another WDT tool if the fancier ones can eliminate potential for channeling to a degree that spending some more actually justifies it.

If it's information that helps, have it set to 9 bar, which I understand is 8 at the group head.

  
Shots are tasting really good. Regardless of time to brew, I've tasted every shot I've pulled and from a standpoint of taste alone, they've been decently well balanced from a flavor standpoint. Even on longer shots, however, I've still been getting some channeling unless I jump from 18 grams to 20+. I'm going down the rabbit hole here, and will eventually watch a lot of guides to perfect everything, but outside of channeling, the espresso tastes great to me, but I'm sure it could taste better. 

  
Sorry for the rambling post, but just looking for advice and really enjoying chatting about it. Thanks all.",1,1731967054.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

When I notice that I have some beads I'm not using and stuck on, I'll put them in a cup lid, and start adding beads in the same color range until I get a usable bead mix.

Images and beads I got stuck on-
1. The weird bakery fimo beads, coffee cup & waffle charm, and a million fimo smileys
2. The shells, weird off-teal color balls
3. Heart fimo beads with flowers and the purple balls
4. the tri beads, more fimo hearts, more ball letters, more weird fimo candy shapes

I go to non-rave events and hand these out, and will hand out about 150 and maybe find 5-10 other people to trade with. For me, it's less about the trade, and more about making friends and brightening days. (Although my trades are precious and I love them dearly)

1gugoaj,https://i.redd.it/hbsdsyjdeq1e1.jpeg,[Setup] From built-in to hand grinder: Surprising upgrade path with my Lelit Anita. Would love to hear your suggestions!,"Hey r/espresso! Wanted to share my current setup and get your thoughts on potential upgrades. I started two years ago with the Lelit Anita combo (PL042EM), which has served me well as an entry point into proper espresso making.

Recently made the switch from the built-in grinder to a Commandante C40 with Red Clix axle for more precise espresso grinding. While hand grinding isn't for everyone, the improvement in consistency and control has been worth the extra effort each morning. This grinder is pure joy.

One of my favorite workflow improvements has been the Felicita Arc scale. Being able to log all my shots in the Filtru-app has been a game-changer - I track everything from dose to yield and extraction time. It's really helped me dial in my beans and maintain consistency. I find myself checking the logs frequently to replicate my best shots, and it's become an essential part of my daily coffee routine. And auto-tara and auto-timer is such a game-changer in UX. Pure joy.

My usual routine is a straight double espresso on weekday mornings to kick-start the day. Weekends are more relaxed - that's when I make cappuccinos for my girlfriend and myself. There's something special about sharing those morning coffee moments together.

I'm considering modding the Anita with a PID temperature controller + sensor for better temperature stability. For those who've done similar mods - was it worth it? Any specific PID kits you'd recommend? I found Clever Coffee, but I am not sure if I am willing to go down that road, as I have no experience with electronics whatsoever.

Looking for advice on what to upgrade next to improve shot quality. No specific budget in mind, but prefer cost-effective improvements. Would love to hear your suggestions!

It's more in my nature to be a passive scroller, but I figured it would be good to take a different approach and put myself out there for once.

I'm not a big fan of dating apps. They're extremely superficial and most people don't have a bio. Even if you do find somebody with similar interests that you find attractive, they're often bots, take forever to respond or have absolutely no ability to continue a conversation. Maybe you can show me that Reddit is different?

***About me***

Interests - Gaming (PC / Switch), cycling, reading (fantasy / sci-fi / light novels), bouldering, anime, walks, hiking, manga, holidays, watching films & series

Adulting essentials - I'm a homeowner, full-time employed, driver, can cook, clean, wash clothes, wash up, take care of pets, manage the bills, do the bins & do the weekly shop

Looks - I'm 5'11.5"" tall (let me have that .5), weigh 76kg, slim to normal build but working towards being athletic, wear glasses, am mixed Thai/British, currently have a short beard

Food - I'm omnivorous. Steak, fish, cottage pie, pasta bakes, lasagne, roasts, kiev, pizza, curry, stir fries, hot pots, fry ups, sweet desserts, ice cream. I love all sorts of cuisine and takeaways

I predominantly work from home, so get most of the chores done in the week. You'll get tea/coffees in bed, a hot water bottle waiting for you when you get home in the winter and all the love, care and support you deserve. There's music I like but I don't usually go out of my way to listen to it (shh, I know I'm weird), so you have full control over the playlist if we're driving somewhere.

My love languages are touch and spending time together. Have you had a rough day and need to lay down after work? Don't worry, I'll cook you dinner, we'll snuggle up on the sofa while watching something and then I'll wash up after you fall asleep.

***What I'm looking for***

Preferably somebody who has at least some overlapping interests. Somebody with emotional intelligence and understands their needs and wants and doesn't play mind games or gaslights. With me, what you see is what you get. I'll tell you how I'm feeling or what's on my mind. I'd love to have a partner who is willing to open up to me instead of letting it fester. I'm not looking for an online or a long distance relationship, so I have a strong preference to meet people more local.

I know you shouldn't judge a book by its cover but physical attraction does play an important role in most relationships. I have a preference for anything from slim to a little curvy and don't care about your height.

If you made it this far then congratulations! Please say more than just hi if you think we'd get along well :)",1,1731966203.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I'm a non-immigrate who took the exam on the 25th of October

I started this journey 2 years ago when I was in the 5th stage (in my country there are 6 years in total without pre-med years) studying amboss step 2ck and anking just after I had passed the step1 exam My average amboss blocks scores were between 65-85% After a while, I started UWorld which took me a whole year

UWorld is just amazing I can't describe In words how much it helped me during the exam and my clinical rotations More than 95% of questions knowledge in the real exam were included in UWorld
I think that amboss helped me to get high scores in UWorld blocks (my total UWorld score was 86% first pass)

Anking was amazing. I used it for step 1 and continued it for step 2. I can't even describe how many questions anking helped me with (you will be able to solve the easy questions in a matter of seconds) When you use anki make cards for any new information that is not found in anking (most of the high-yield information is included in the anking deck) and try to copy the question you missed and put it under missed questions or lecture notes, for any UWorld or amboss questions review the related question ID numbers cards and open the cards you didn't know before (Don't open the cards randomly just open the cards related to the question you are studying right now)

After finishing UWorld blocks, I started the UWorld exams 
Test 3 scored 264 (harder than the exam) 
Test 1 scored 269 (easier than the exam) 
Test 2 scored 271 (just like the real exam with shorter questions)

I advise you to finish all UWorld exams and then start NBMEs and CMS forms (UWorld question style is not like the exam questions)

CMS forms took me almost a month they are very good at learning the style of the exam questions (the last 2 CMS forms of each subject are the most important and the closest to the exam)

Finally, I started the NBMEs 
NBME 9 scored 263 (1 month before the exam)
NBME 14 scored 271 (10 days before the exam)
Free Step 2 scored 90% (5 days before the exam)

I advise you to purchase all the NBMEs if you can they are amazing to prepare you for the real deal and enrich your knowledge

On the exam day, I was relaxed but I had 10 to 20 flag questions in each block that I didn't have enough time to go back to check which was very stressful for me I took bananas, coffee, and dates which were great for me (protein bars are very heavy for me) Try to relax in the exam (it is doable), read every question as this is the last chance to read it, and do what you can. Never think about how you did (I thought I would fail step 2 just after I finished the exam)

1gugerv,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1gugerv/roommate_vows_to_never_let_my_gf_sleep_at_night/,Roommate vows to never let my gf sleep at night until she gets her to move out ,"
 

I'm posting on behalf of my girlfriend 31F who resides in Manchester, Uk. I reside in a different country. I will refer to her as gf or my girlfriend for the rest of this. She moved to the UK in 2020, completed her studies and works for a company over there currently. Earlier this year she was looking for accommodation closer to her workplace she moved to Manchester on October 4th 2024. She found a roommate, 28F on spareroom (house letting website) that she met for the first time two days before moving in. I will refer to her as the roommate for the rest of this.
 The roommate was a bit flaky from the start. Not responding to texts on confirming payments and procedures on time. Ghosting my gf for a few days and then getting back with an excuse that she was too tired to respond. These things seemed small and I told my gf it wasn’t such a big deal. She would say she wasn’t sure about this person’s reliability. My girlfriend had been looking for accommodation for almost 4 months and despite her initial trepidations with the roommate decided to go ahead with it due to lack of better options. Once they moved in together, things started off on a bad note. My girlfriends only condition was about noise past 11pm and they should clean up after themselves. She works a 9-5 and deals with calculations throughout the day. Being foggy at work makes it quite challenging for her. 

The day before they moved in the roommate informed my girlfriend over text message about having a guest, 24F, over the next week for a duration of ten days. My girlfriend said it might be too early to have guests over for such a duration of time barely a week after moving in. She pointed out the inconvenience of having a guest staying over during unpacking and settling in. She also said she was completely fine if it was a little later in the month. The roommate said that it was not possible to say no because the guest was her cousin, she was flying in from another country and she felt awkward to tell her uncle no. My girlfriend thought it was odd that she mentioned having a guest coming to stay over literally a day before moving in. Also, the roommate dismissed my girlfriends saying she wasn’t comfortable having a guest over so soon into moving in.

 On the first day, the roommate began cooking at 12 am and finished around 1:30am. The following morning, my girlfriend had requested her to avoid using the kitchen past 11pm since it was quite impossible to sleep with the noise (my girlfriend’s room opens into the kitchen and living room). Late at night its quiet enough to hear the roommate chewing.
The other major issue was the roommate would slam doors when she opened and closed them. This would rattle other doors in their frame, including my gf’s bedroom door. My girlfriend would wake up with a start every time the roommate opened or closed her bedroom or toilet door which was in the living room. My girlfriend would tell her to be mindful about the doors the third day after they moved in. The roommate acknowledged those messages but continued to be disruptive still. The second time when my girlfriend told the roommate about noise was about a week later when the guest was staying over. They would be repeated trips to the toilet at night by the roommate and her guest and the door slamming was extremely noisy. When my girlfriend communicated this to the roommate, she had said 'please limit toilet usage' when she had actually meant 'limit the noise of the door slamming when using the toilet'. My gf also added that she hopes they haven't gotten off on the wrong foot and she was just trying to communicate her boundaries about noise and sharing a space and that was that. She said she hoped that they got along and a had a peaceful time in the coming months. The roommate would coldly reply that she wasn't looking to make friends. The roommate told my gf to speak to the agency and have them replace the walls if was too much for her. The roommate said this wasn’t a problem for her and if my gf had an issue then she should move out (essentially telling her this is a you problem. This interaction was less than ten days after they had moved in). My girlfriend would immediately clarify in the following message that she didn't mean don't use the toilet but rather don't slam the doors while using the toilet. (this will come up at the end)

This same behavior continued throughout the week the guest was there. The roommate and her guest started cooking around 10pm. The roommate sent her text that read ""we are cooking now"".   My girlfriend stepped out around 11 pm and requested them to quiet down. They would ignore her and continue cooking, talking and laughing loudly. My gf stepped out again an hour and a half later and asked them to please wind up. This was around 12:30 am. The guest said my gf was being silly and apologised with a mocking tone (""I'm sorry, mummy"").  They finally went to their room at 1 am. 
The guest was scheduled to leave the next morning and left. Following this, there was a bit of hostility between my girlfriend and the roommate. The roommate seems to be an inherently loud person. Her voice and cackling, clamorous laughter over phone conversations is extremely loud (I can vouch for this as well having heard it numerous times when I'm on the phone with my gf). The roommate defended her guest being loud saying that she asked her once to quiet down but there are only so many times that she can ask a grown woman to talk quietly. She's even said people from her country are just loud like that. Initially, I would tell my gf that her being loud was just the way she was and to let it go. But would see that roommate was quite boorish simply because she had no respect for another person in a shared space.

The late-night cooking would happen about once or twice a week and but the banging of doors was an almost daily affair. I know this because my gf had now begun to struggle to sleep almost daily. 
She was getting maybe one or two nights of undisturbed sleep a week and her mental health clearly began to deteriorate. She was always patient and kind to me but had begun to snap which was very out of character for her in the 6 years we've known each other. She also seemed to have become extremely depressed.    

No amounts of attempts at requesting the roommate to be mindful of noise beyond 11pm was met with any regard. It must also be noted that the roommate does not work a night shift or a late job. She has similar work timings to my gf. This was one of the reasons that my gf wanted to room with her. The roommate has also casually mentioned on occasion that she was late to work in the morning because she was up all night watching tik toks. She clearly can cook at a reasonable time but chooses not to. There was even one time when my gf asked her about noise at 1 am in the kitchen, she simply denied it was her (they were the only two people in the house).

There were other issues with them living together. For example, the roommate would finish eating at around 1-2 am. Because my gf had told her not to make noise, she would leave the dishes in the sink at 2 am until 6-7pm the next day. It would begin to smell quite bad. I had advised my gf to let it go, since the roommate was eventually doing them. One time, my gf had done the dishes for her and mentioned it to her that would be ideal not to leave dishes undone post a meal time. This first lead to the roommate flat out denying ever leaving dishes undone. When my gf mentioned she had just done them, the roommate would tell her that she never asked her to do it and to leave the dishes alone. She would also get a bit agitated about putting her dishes in the dishwasher saying she doesn't like the smell of them after. (This small thing regarding the dishes is would come up later when the roommate later spirals). Anyway, I told my gf to let it go and choose her battles. Dishes unwashed for a day was a lesser bother than having your sleep disturbed. There were other seemingly trivial things as well. The roommate left some cardboard boxes in the living room for a month. My gf assumed she hadn’t gotten to unpacking them. When she asked her about them the roommate said it wasn’t bothering anyone and looks fine in the hall. Again, I told my gf to let it go because it wasn’t worth arguing over having cardboard boxes in the common living space. On another occasion, my gf had put away a single use plastic container that came with a takeaway dinner the roommate had previously ordered for recycling. The roommate told her not to touch her stuff. My gf said it was an honest mistake and she assumed it was for recycling( this will also come up later).

These seemingly small things began to turn hostile from the very beginning. Any attempt by my gf to keep things cordial and friendly was met with the roommate saying she isn't looking for friends. Keep in mind, more than a month has passed and my girlfriend hasn't slept properly at all. During this time, she began to tell me that she suspects that the roommate is slamming the doors and being disruptive on purpose. I tell her that seems a bit much and that the roommate probably just doesn't understand how disruptive and noisy it is. My girlfriend tells me that she has pointed it out to her repeatedly and even the last time she did, the roommate would slam the door later that very night. The door slamming had gotten really bad but I tried to her reason that the roommate was probably absent minded or simply didn't realize the extent to which the door was making noise. My girlfriend had tried to do as much to reduce noise. She ordered a door wedge from amazon to keep her room door in place if other doors slam and even put in her airpods with white noise at night but it was still too loud. My gf described it as a loud bang that would startle her awake with her heart racing.

My girlfriend is a patient and non-confrontational person. I would often times tell her to make sure she lets the roommate know when she has woken her up at night or when she is noisy so that she knows she’s disturbing her. The roommate always seemed to have an excuse for it or would flatly deny it happening and once even said it wasn't her (they are the only two people in the apartment). Finally, after the last confrontation they both stopped talking entirely for a week. My girlfriend tried to appease some tension. Once she had baked some potato wedges and made some extra and told the roommate to help herself. The roommate would say a monotone ' no ' and walk back to her room. All of this seemed to affect my girlfriend's mental health even more. She kept telling me that she didn't like living in such a hostile environment and wished things weren't so tense. She began to dread going home and her mood would always visibly dip when she did. The air in the house was very heavy and I could see it affecting her day by day. Every morning when I wished my gf good morning, I stopped asking her if she slept well, knowing the answer. It seemed that the roommate wasn't willing to listen, communicate or accommodate anymore. She mentioned that the roommate stopped saying hello or anything. My girlfriend has been good friends with previous housemates, still keeping in touch, travelling to neighboring towns to visit them and generally was on good terms with them. She wasn’t used to having so much conflict and all for asking someone not to be disruptive at night.  Anyway, one night, my girlfriend decides to offer up peace, just so the air at the house doesn’t hang heavy, she sends a message to the roommate saying that they should put everything past them and maybe they could try to start out as friends. She said it was good that they had started off communicating initially and it was normal to speak about boundaries especially when two new people began to live together.  My girlfriend forwarded me the message as well and I found myself smiling at it while reading, thinking it was probably over. The message was a mistake and my girlfriend would find out the very next morning as to why.
The message was immediately met with anger from the roommate whom accused my gf of being fake, two faced, a liar and delusional.  She said that as long as bills were met and there was no damage to property there was no reason to further engage in conversation. She began to point out things about my gf being a liar. She said there was also a time when my girlfriend left ‘coffee granules’ on the counter.  
She would send a video of a countertop to prove some point about my gf leaving it dirty. The odd thing was the countertop was clean. My gf had shared the video with me as well. I honestly couldn’t see anything.  And in response my girlfriend showed the roommate an oil stained countertop which seemed to trigger her into an intense rage. She began sending a lot of laughing emoticons saying that my gf was smiling to the roommates face and taking photographs of countertops behind her back proving that she was two faced (gf had to do this because of the number of times the roommate kept denying things. In fact it was the only time she had taken a photo).  She also called my gf inconsiderate and said that my gf would ‘act accommodating’ but  actually wasn’t. She began to accuse gf of being delusional and said her antics wouldn’t work on her. To be frank, when I read the messages on my own they seemed quite erratic and rage filled.  She kept adding laughing smileys and dancing women emoticons 💃💃 and stuff. 
 At this point, my gf and I typed a strongly worded message calling her out on all her misbehavior. The roommate and her kept going back forth. The roommate seemed to keep misdirecting. For example, when my gf pointed out the first time she confronted the roommate about noise, she asked her to move out if it was going to be a problem. The roommate  said gf was a big liar.  She said It wasn’t the first time, it was  apparently the second time she confronted her two days after the first. The point being the roommate was never willing to change or be reasonable and started off telling my gf to move out if it was problem. She similarly would bring up that my gf had told her not to use the toilet at night (which wasn’t the case and was clarified then). She also said my gf was a liar for saying the roommate forced her to do dishes (that was never said). She accused gf of “touching her things like her bowl” (the bowl being the single use takeaway container my gf had kept aside for recycling) . She kept saying gf was a liar. She said that she was going to stay up late and it was none of gf business( gf doesn't care about what she does at night unless she's being noisy) My gf said the roommate was being vindictive and that seemed to really trigger her.
She began threatening my girlfriend that she would not give her any peace and would make sure she makes as much noise as possible until my girlfriend moves out. She said that she would show her what true vindictiveness is. She told gf that she was going to begin to slam doors more, make sure she uses the toilet in a noisy way and cook late at night. She followed it with “Good luck sleeping at night 🤣🤣🤣” . She began to call my gf spineless, a liar and delusional. She kept repeating lies, lies, lies for everything gf said which was quite odd. She says that my girlfriend will have to move out one way or the other and she will force her to move out one way or another. The roommate said my gf was not living with any other roommates or by herself and my gf was stuck with her.
She began threatening my girlfriend that she  would make sure she makes as much noise and be disruptive as possible until my gf moves out. She says that my gf will have to move out one way or the other. 
This is all about 45 days since they moved in. Her vengeful reaction has made my girlfriend quite afraid to continue living with someone like this. 
They have signed an agreement for one year. But it seems quite unlivable at this point. Is there any way we could contact the letting agency and have this roommate’s contract terminated? She has openly threatened to make my gfs life a living hell until she moves out. My gf has become quite afraid for her safety now that the roommate has vowed to make her life miserable. Her mental health has already deteriorated and this has made extremely worried. I told her to stay with a friend for a couple of nights. Any advice on how to proceed would be appreciated. 

TL;DR Roommate hasn’t allowed my girlfriend to sleep for more than a month. She threatens to be that way and intentionally makes noise at night to make sure she doesn’t sleep. Her intention is to force her to move out. Advice on how to proceed",0,1731966106.0,badroommates,2,0.5,False

Steam is produced correctly and the same with hot water. The problem is that the steam or hot water does not reach the nozzle. This problem results in the fact that at the moment when the cup should be filling with frothed milk the drip tray is filling with hot water.

I have removed the casing and do not see any leakage from any connections, tubes, etc. Rather than a leak it looks like the coffee machine is redirecting water directly into the drip tray.

The problem is temporarily solved by heating the coffee machine. If I set it to hot water several times the second or third time instead of into the drip tray it will flow through the nozzle and then I can make coffee normally. The problem returns when the coffee machine cools down.

What I did:  
\- reset to factory settings  
\- descaled the coffee machine using the official DeLonghi product  
\- I took the casing apart and looked for leaks but found nothing (The drip tray does not fill up due to a leak, but rather due to water being redirected to the tray.)

This was his plan all along, to keep Silksong from winning the GOTY award and to opress the gamer population by keeping us suspended in a permanent state of hopefulness as we lost the war. We believed we would win the war. We all said we would win tomorrow.....

With the gamers out of the way, he goes on to become President of Earth in 2029 and builds a lazer beam that vaporized Team Cherry HQ, the last flicker of the resistance.

Ari is designing an Anti-Keighley Beam, one powerful enough to eradicate all the cringe, war-mongering announcement show hosts in the world. However, he can't do that *and* also release Silksong at the same time.

1gug80h,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gug80h/i_really_like_him_outside_of_the_bedroom/,I really like him... outside of the bedroom,"Hi, y'all, hope you're doing well. Just a warning, this will probably be longer than it needs to be because I tend to be a pretty long-winded person lol, but anyway... I (23F) matched with this guy (29M) on a dating site a few weeks ago. Ever since we first started talking, it's just been really wonderful. We vibe so well and have enough similar interests to keep the conversations going smoothly, but also enough different interests that truly just make him such a fun and interesting person to me! I've been on this dating site this year that has only led to a couple dates with one other person before this several months back, and all the other very early on talking stages that developed I just really avoided going out with because idk it just didn't feel worth it I guess. But he was different. I was so excited when he first asked to make plans to go out yesterday. Also, I am a very sexual person. I've been working on suppressing it in these beginning stages because I am wanting a deep and meaningful relationship. Buuuuuuuut I was really starting to like this guy the more we talked, and he never brought the conversation to sex/wasn't pushy about anything like that, so it just made me feel more comfortable being a bit sexual in my flirtations because I didn't feel like it was all he wanted. That led to us talking about the potential for us to have sex last night, and we both agreed we were possibly open to it but not expecting anything, but that it was on the table (of course if both parties consented at that point). We also vaguely discussed our interests in the bedroom, but one thing I made clear is that I want a partner that cares about my pleasure as much as I care about theirs and that even though sex isn't everything in a relationship.. It does matter, so that is a dealbreaker for me. He was honest with me and told me that in the past he has been a ""selfish lover"" but he wants to work on that moving forward. So anyway, on to last night (our first date), we had plans to go out to dinner and then I would possibly come over for us to hangout and chat and maybe watch a movie or play a board game or whatever. I wasn't sure where he wanted to take me, so I asked earlier in the day where he wanted to meet. He asked if I just wanted to meet at 7pm at his place and I said sure. I get there (drove over an hour) and he asked if I still wanted to go out to eat because he wasn't really hungry. Honestly, I wasn't either, so I told him that and he said ok and that we could just hangout there then. Even though we had plans to do that after dinner, this immediately bothered me. It was our first time meeting, and I think it would have been more appropriate given our previous discussions on some things to at least ask to just go get coffee or a drink or something instead of just hanging out at his place. It just added an unnecessary amount of pressure I guess, especially considering we had planned on me possibly coming over after, not 100% that I would. So I couldn't help but immediately feel as though I was just a booty call at that point. But anyway, the first couple hours I was there I really had a great time. I can be a pretty awkward and shy person, especially for a first meeting, but I was loving just sitting and chatting with him about random things. We're both gamers, so he showed me a little bit of this game he had started, he showed me his pokemon cards, and we just chatted for a bit about randomness and it was just lovely honestly. Then we picked out a movie to watch and got all cuddly, and I just felt so comfortable with him it was great. I'm not usually really comfortable being like that with someone I haven't known that long and just first met in person a couple hours before, but I was with him. And also side note, I find him quite attractive as well. So there's a bit of context for you, now for a bit of the nsfw stuff. We ended up making out a bit during the movie, one thing led to another and my boobs were out and I was jerking him off, you know how it is 😅 And he asks if I wanna go to his bedroom. I end up giving him a blowjob, and well that was that.. I fell asleep for a lil bit (we already discussed me sleeping there if I needed to with how late it was and how far of a drive it was) and I woke up a bit later and we had sex, and then a while later he woke me up from another mini nap I took and I gave him another blowjob. So... to explain a bit more why I'm bothered by our time in the bedroom, the only sexual attention I got all evening, aside from him actually fucking me for a couple minutes (no shade, it happens and that's not why I'm bothered lol), was him playing with my boobs quite a bit. Aside from that, I got absolutely nothing. He didn't even finger me, let alone eat me out. Didn't put anything near my vagina at all except for his dick at one point. I made him cum 3 times throughout the night, and I wouldn't be bothered by the fact that I didn't if he would have at least put in an ounce of effort to make me. First times together especially I never expect to cum (one of the joys of being a woman lol), but he didn't even try or act like he cared enough to even pretend to try. I'm even more bothered by the fact that we had a conversation about how stuff like that would ultimately end up being a deal breaker for me, and he acknowledged that, but then that happens? Honestly, I just feel pretty used, and not in a fun way. Outside of the bedroom though, I really like this guy (and for more reasons than listed at the top, this is just getting kinda long lol). I think I'm gonna try to talk to him one more time about it and point out how he made me feel last night, but I'm worried it won't even matter to him since the conversation we had previously clearly went in one ear and out the other. But after that, if he doesn't actually care about my pleasure moving forward, would you continue to pursue something with this person if you were in my shoes, just simply based on how great it's been so far regarding everything aside from sex?

Also, random, but I baked this man banana bread as well before coming over. I brought basic banana bread and chocolate chip banana bread, and not to brag but it was yummy lol. I put in EFFORT for last night, and now that I'm really thinking about it, I feel really unappreciated for all of the effort I put in. ",1,1731965635.0,dating,2,1.0,False

Most coffee pots I’ve seen have plastic containers and funnels for the boiling water that eventually goes into your coffee pot. 

I even have one of those stainless stove top coffee makers, thought it was all metal but I realized one of the internal parts was faux metal. I literally have yet to find an all metal regular old coffee maker pot. I think I’ll just buy a glass/metal French press.

This is not even mentioning keurig coffee. Most of those coffee makers are totally plastic and the k-cups themselves get punctured and have boiling water run through them.

1gug66n,https://www.reddit.com/r/dunkindrinks/comments/1gug66n/the_great_midnight_hoax/,The great midnight hoax ,"I’m a long time Dunkin’ Donuts drinker for many years now I know what I like and I know what I don’t like. years ago there was a dark roast option that I really liked and preferred over the original blend to the point where I actually don’t like the original blend anymore, I can’t stand it. Later on midnight replaces dark roast as the dark roast option I guess as a branding thing. I’m not certain I tasted a huge difference, but I do like midnight also, and now when I drink Dunkin every day, I drink midnight. So a couple of months ago it was brought to my attention that when I order midnight roast coffee about 90% of the time, I’m not actually getting it. Let me fill you in on a little bit of backstory. 

I used to work a job overnight driving through neighborhoods and at 5 AM one specific location of Dunkin’ Donuts is where I ended up every night because they opened at five am. I use the mobile app to make my order and when I get there, I drive-through and pick up my order. I emphasize I’ve been going to Dunkin’ Donuts for many years in the morning at my old job, and at this overnight job and even in my old neighborhood, stores would see my face. It was not uncommon that Dunkin’ Donuts staff would recognize me and memorize my orders. As soon as they see my face they start working on it. That’s how much I went and my order has always been pretty simple. I drink, black coffee and the only variations on that I’ve ever had is if I put a little sugar in it or hazelnut flavor and that’s it.  If I get food or not depends,…but about three or four different Dunkin’ Donuts locations in my lifetime have memorized me by face by order. So this particular location always had midnight brewing for me specifically and they were very nice and they always made it a point to say we are brewing this just for you. I guess as if not many people order it which is what I assumed originally anyway, but I never understood why they needed to emphasize that they are brewing midnight ready just for me.

So this overnight job that I had got to a point where I started to not feel the jolt of my midnight coffee so I started adding an espresso shot to it and I’m not an espresso drinker, but I did feel the jolt after that, and unfortunately, I start using this method to keep up energy so now I can literally taste the difference between midnight coffee, original blend, and midnight coffee with an espresso shot in it. I know the taste and I know the difference because I don’t put milk in it or too much sugar or anything like that, and sometimes when people burn coffee that could happen too and the taste is weird. As time went on I realized espresso is not for me. I don’t like the way it makes me feel, I feel like I started to develop heart palpitations after I introduced it to my diet. One thing that I did notice, though was depending on who was working in the store, the quality of the coffee would be different so during the weekdays the staff that had the midnight coffee ready for me the coffee was perfect and on the weekend because I worked literally every day the coffee tasted funny. Either it was watered down or just tasted like a weird version of the espresso so I ended up taking a break from coffee because I did not like how my body was reacting to it. 
I reset my body, got rest change my schedule, and started back on coffee again.
So a couple of months ago it was brought to my attention after ordering my go to coffee from a completely different store that when I order midnight black with hazelnut flavor, what the staff is doing is taking original blend and then they heat up some espresso…pour it in there and stir it up and if I hadnt happened to catch this as it was happening, I probably would never know that 99% of the time this is how Dunkin’ Donuts stores all over the place are making midnight blend when you ask for midnight. 

They’re giving you original and they’re putting espresso in it and then mixing it up and calling it the midnight brew. And being somebody that doesn’t like the taste of the original blend I wasn’t happy about this and actually kind of pissed me off because, it explained so much of the difference in quality between the times that I ordered it with people that are looking out for me apparently and everybody else who’s doing this by the numbers technique that seems to be a mainstay within the Dunkin’ Donuts stores.  They must do it to save money. 

So not intentionally but I went on to further prove this fact. I’ve since visited about five or six stores and sadly they all do it and I order my order inside the store now and watch them pour original blend and mix it with an espresso shot when I’m asking for Midnight brew. 


Listen, if that’s what it is then just say that, but if I’m asking for a specific thing then just say that you don’t have it or you don’t want todo it and this is what we want give you in return.  I personally don’t want drink espresso specifically.  I also specifically don’t like the taste of the original blend that’s two things. I actually do like how the midnight brew comes out when it’s brewed. So now when I order Dunkin I go inside. I watch them do the wrong thing and I asked them kindly: “Hey is it possible you can just brew a bag of the midnight for me? I have no problem waiting for it”.  When I pointed out like that every time they all seem to reset and say oh, and then they have some excuse about how it’s the same thing. And to be fair even if they could articulate it I’m personally not interested in whatever the reason is, I don’t want to drink it. I want to drink a brewed pot of midnight. I don’t want to  drink a mixture of two different things if that’s possible.  If it’s not possible then just say so. But I don’t like this because again, I was staying away from espresso. I thought I was, but apparently I’ve been drinking it the whole time so I don’t know who likes midnight and maybe I’m the only person on earth that asked for midnight but at Dunkin,  unless you asked for them to brew a pot, there’s a  99% chance that they’re not brewing it at all and they’re giving you something else and yes, I can taste the difference.",1,1731965512.0,dunkindrinks,0,1.0,False
1gug5xo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pestcontrol/comments/1gug5xo/gentrol_point_source_risks/,Gentrol point source risks,"Hi all,

I just placed 6 of these gentrol point source things in a small kitchen, each about 3 feet apart. instructions said 1 was good for \~75 square feet, but to use more if needed. In total i probably placed like 12 in the apartment

I usually see them on counter top, but i prepare food there, so i placed the point sources below, about midway between counter top and floor. I also placed one on the outside face of the dish washer since i believe some live inside the joints there, as well as one on my computer desk around 2-3 feet from me at upper chest height, and another on the wall about 2feet forward+4 feet above from face height on desk

My concerns are:

1. are the locations i chose (near food preparation areas// outside of dishwasher//computer desk) safe locations or could this have adverse effects on me? I can easily move the desk one, but i know roaches live between the cupboards, in the dishwasher, between oven and stove, and im guessing inside the coffee machine, possibly toaster and air fryer as well, so I dont know how to affect them without placing near such areas.
2. should I get rid of some of the ones I placed, since i probably went a bit overboard?

Any advice greatly appreciated!",1,1731965494.0,pestcontrol,3,1.0,False

What I do have a problem with is in the latest vlog Hunter cannot shut up.

It was so cringey to watch and down right degrading. I could tell on Julia's face she wasn't having it but I've always noticed she is very submissive with him. It's very strange. I would be pissed if my husband talked over me constantly and wouldn't let me share my feelings. 

Also, with the cabin I can't with the content anymore. It is so boring and you can tell they are over it because it's not that exciting anymore now that it's bleeding them dry. They love their precious land so much but by the time they get rid of the cabin and build their dream house on that property feels like it could be 5+years away. It's not a quick thing.

1gug4sa,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1gug4sa/focus_he_whispered_to_himself/,"Focus, He Whispered to Himself ","*Focus, Marty. This is all about focus.* 

*Think about Alice. Keep driving. Eyes on the road.* 

*The hitchhikers will step out eventually. They always do.* 

*Just don’t look back at them. Don’t ever look back, for that matter.*

*Don’t think, just drive.* 

—-----------------------------------

I have a lot of love for my parents, having the generosity to take Alice and me in after her leukemia relapsed, but goddamn do they live far from civilization. Or maybe there just ain’t a lot of civilization in Idaho to go around - not in a bad way; the quiet is nice. I’ve been enjoying the countryside more than I anticipated. That being said, they could stand to spend some taxpayer dollars on a few more Walgreens locations. 

Feels like I’ve been driving all night; must almost be morning. They have to be worried sick. Alice may actually be physically sick without her antinausea meds.

I shook my head side to side in a mix of disbelief and self-flagellating shame. Took a left turn when I should have taken a right - a downright boneheaded mistake. The price for overworking myself, but I mean, what other option do I have? Chemotherapy ain’t exactly cheap. 

For a moment, I forgot where I was and what I was doing and looked in the rearview mirror at the five hitchhikers in my backseats. Silent and staring forward with dead and empty eyes at nothing in particular from the back of my small Sudan.

Furiously, my eyes snapped forward, not wanting to linger too long on them - wasn’t sure what I’d see. 

Can’t be doing that on this road. Maintaining focus is key. 

—-----------------------------------

Despite my near-instantaneous reaction, I did see the new hitchhikers, but only for a moment. No surprises this time, thankfully. They wore suits like all the others, monocolored with earthy tones from head to toe. Same odd fabric, too - rough and coarse-looking, almost like leather. Honestly, never seen anything like it before tonight. 

But I haven’t ever been in a situation like this before, either. Whatever backwoods county I got myself turned around in, it likes to follow its own rules. 

For example, I didn’t pull over to pick up these hitchhikers. Somehow, they just found their way in. Or maybe I did pull over and let them in? Been so tired lately; who could even be sure. And they don’t say much, no matter how many questions I ask. Would love to know where I am, but I guess it isn’t for them to say.

My gaze again drifted, this time from the road to the car’s dashboard, and I let myself see the time. Big mistake.

7:59PM.

Nope, that ain’t right. I rapidly blinked a few times, adjusted myself so I was sitting up straighter, and then looked back to check again.

Now, it didn’t show any time at all. 

*Marty, Jesus. Focus up.* 

I blinked once more, this time for longer. Not sure how long, couldn’t been longer than ten seconds. If I close my eyes for too long, they become hard to open again. Requires a lot of energy.

4:45AM. 

See, there we go. Now *that* makes sense. By the time dawn arrives, I’m sure I will have found a gas station to pull over in. Ask for directions back to…whatever my parent’s address is. I’ll figure that out later, right now I need to focus. 

—-----------------------------------

Funny things happened in this part of the country when you didn’t focus. Sometimes, the yellow pavement markings would change colors - or disappear entirely. Other times, the road itself would start to look off - black asphalt turning to muddy brownstone at a moment’s notice. 

At first, it scared me. Scared me a lot, come to think of it. Made me want to pull over and close my eyes.

But Alice needed her nausea meds, and judging by the time, I had work in two short hours. I needed to make it home soon so I can check on her, give her a kiss before school. Hopefully, I’ll have time to brew a pot of coffee, too. 

But my eyes, they just don’t seem to want to stick with the program. Dancing around from thing to thing like they don’t have a care in the world. They have one job - watch the road for places that might have a map or someone who can tell me where I am. Well, two jobs. Watch the road *and* focus on the road. 

At least the road wasn’t treacherous. It has been pretty much straight the whole night after the wrong turn. 

—-----------------------------------

Initially, Alice was nervous about starting at her new school. And I get it - that transition is hard enough without factoring in everything she has had to manage in her short life. We’d been lucky though, finding a well-reviewed sign language school - in Idaho, of all places.  

She’s amazing - you’d think that the leukemia and the deafness from her first go with chemotherapy would have crushed her spirit. Not my Alice. She’s tough as nails. Tough as nails like her dad. 

I smiled, basking in a moment of fatherly pride. Of course, you can’t be doing that on this road. You’ll start to see things you don’t want to see. 

When my eyes again met the rearview mirror, I noticed there was now only one hitchhiker now, but he had transformed and revealed his real shape.

His face was flat like a manhole cover, almost the size of a manhole cover, too, but less circular - more oblong. He was staring at me with one bulging eye. It was the only one he had, the only one I could see at least. No other recognizable facial features. Just the one, bloated, soulless eye. 

What’s worse, I saw what was behind him. Behind the car, I mean. 

I closed my eyes as soon as I could, but my mind was already rapidly reviewing and trying to reconcile what I had seen behind the car. There was a wall a few car lengths away. No road to be seen, just an inclined wall with tire tracks on it. The atmosphere behind me had a weird thickness to it. Lightrays shone through the thickness unnaturally from someplace above. The ground looked like dust, or maybe sand, why would the ground look like -  

*FOCUS. Think of Alice, and focus*

When I finally found the courage to open my eyes, it all looked right again, and I breathed a sigh of relief and chuckled to myself from behind the wheel. Straight road in front of me, framed by a starless black sky. Everything in its right place. Until I saw something snaking its way into my peripheral vision. 

The hitchhiker was now in the passenger’s seat.

He turned to me and leaned his body forward over the stickshift; his lips were pursed and nearly pressing against my ears, rhythmically opening and closing his mouth but making no sound. I could have sworn he was close enough to touch my ear with his lips, but I guess he wasn't because I couldn’t feel it. Instead, I felt my heartbeat start to race, or I imagined what it was like to feel your heartbeat race. 

Why did I have to imagine...?

*Don’t turn. Don’t look. Don’t think. Just focus.* 

But I couldn’t. Something was wrong. I thought about closing my eyes. For a while, not just for a little. To see what would happen. I was curious what would happen. Had been all night, actually.

But then, like the angel she was, Alice’s visage appeared on the horizon. She was standing at her second-story window in my parent’s home, watching and waiting for me to return from this long night. I wasn’t getting closer for some reason, but she wasn’t getting any further away either. 

She was far, but even at that distance, I could see her doing something in the window. When I squinted, it looked like maybe she was waving.

Alice was waving at me. Alice could see me.

Must mean I'm close.

*Eyes on the road. Focus*

—-----------------------------------

Every night around 8PM, Alice would stand and watch the road from her bedroom on the second story of her grandparents' home. What she was waiting for didn’t happen as often anymore, but her birthday was a week away - the phenomenon seemed to be more frequent around her birthday. As the clock ticked into 8:03PM, she saw a familiar sight - two faint luminescent orbs traveled slowly down the deserted road in her direction, creating even fainter cylinders of light in front of them. 

Like headlights from an approaching car.

The first time this happened, Alice was nine. To cope with her father's disappearance, she would watch the road at night and pretend she saw his car returning home. One night, she saw balls of light appear in the distance, and it made hope explode through her body like fireworks. 

The balls of light turned into the driveway. And when they did, Alice noticed something that made her hope mutate into fear and confusion.

The headlights had no car attached, dissolving without a trace within seconds of their arrival.

For months, this was a nightly occurrence, and only she could see it, which scared Alice. But when she formally explained to the phenomenon to her grandfather for the first time, how they looked like headlights without a car, a weak and bittersweet grin appeared on his face, and he carefully brought up his hands to sign to her:

*I’d bet good money that’s Marty making his way home, sweetheart. He just loved you that much.*

From then on, the orbs comforted Alice and made her feel deeply connected with her long-lost father, wherever he was. But in the present, at the age of nearly seventeen, she had modified the purpose of her vigil.

Originally, she liked the idea of her father’s endless search for her. It made her feel less alone. But as she lived life and matured, she realized how alone he must be looking for her from where he was. Now, all she wanted was for Marty to stop looking. She wanted her father to finally rest. 

Now, when the orbs passed by, she would sign to them from her window, desperately hopeful that even from where he was, he could see her hands move and communicate an important message to him:

*I love you, and I miss you. But please, Dad, let go.*

On top of working 10 hours a week, unloading the dishwasher and taking the rubbish out, I'm not gaming the optimal hours like I want to be. 

I get home at 10pm after my 90 minute shift and head straight to the gaming chair until 5.30 in the morning when the kids start getting up. I fill their water bottles for daycare and let them outside to play as I go to the toilet. I pretend to strain and be in pain so the wife doesn't ask me for help in the morning rush. When she gets them ready and does the daycare drops off I head off to sleep. 

By 10.30am they've all well and truly pissed off for the day and I'm back at the computer. The issue is I'm stuck with our 9 month old who I think has been crying for 2 hours by the time I get up. I give her a packet of chips and make myself a coffee but she usually wants to get up, crawl around and touch my computer chords. She ripped one of them out once when I was in the middle of a battle and I fucking screamed. 

So it has been difficult getting the gaming hours in with a baby being so fucking annoying. 

I eventually found a solution. I put the smallest bit of whiskey on her dummy and place her back in her cot. Then she's usually out of it, cooing in her cot, smashing bugs in games on the iPad or playing with the blind cord for the whole day from 8.30am-3.30pm.

1. The song is NOT in english. Not a single word so bear with me there as I try my best to figure it out. Not even title is in english. Definitely remember it being either Irish or a close neighboring language.

2. It is/was on spotify. It was where I put it in my playlist for a while, before I got rid of it due to low storage at the time. I have no clue if it has a music video or not on Youtube.

3. It is over 5+ minutes long. Probably closer to 7-11+ minutes long, but I'm giving room for error here. 

4. The spotify cover was tan, had I think a woman on it? All I remember is tan (kinda coffee old aged paper tan, like an old drawing), red and I think blueish teal in the center. Black lines in think to help differentiate from the background? I'm sorry if this isn't helpful. Full on battle-y feel to it but I'm not sure.

5. I think it was sung by a woman, or a woman with a man. But I know the backing track had drums. Kinda battle-y feel to it but that could be misguided judgement here.

If anyone finds it that'll be a great great help. I tried looking everywhere. If this isnt for this subreddit I will delete and try again in any subreddit you tell me is best for this request.",1,1731965355.0,Irishmusic,0,1.0,False

—-----------------------------------

I have a lot of love for my parents, having the generosity to take Alice and me in after her leukemia relapsed, but goddamn do they live far from civilization. Or maybe there just ain’t a lot of civilization in Idaho to go around - not in a bad way; the quiet is nice. I’ve been enjoying the countryside more than I anticipated. That being said, they could stand to spend some taxpayer dollars on a few more Walgreens locations. 

Feels like I’ve been driving all night; must almost be morning. They have to be worried sick. Alice may actually be physically sick without her antinausea meds.

I shook my head side to side in a mix of disbelief and self-flagellating shame. Took a left turn when I should have taken a right - a downright boneheaded mistake. The price for overworking myself, but I mean, what other option do I have? Chemotherapy ain’t exactly cheap. 

For a moment, I forgot where I was and what I was doing and looked in the rearview mirror at the five hitchhikers in my backseats. Silent and staring forward with dead and empty eyes at nothing in particular from the back of my small Sudan.

Furiously, my eyes snapped forward, not wanting to linger too long on them - wasn’t sure what I’d see. 

Can’t be doing that on this road. Maintaining focus is key. 

—-----------------------------------

Despite my near-instantaneous reaction, I did see the new hitchhikers, but only for a moment. No surprises this time, thankfully. They wore suits like all the others, monocolored with earthy tones from head to toe. Same odd fabric, too - rough and coarse-looking, almost like leather. Honestly, never seen anything like it before tonight. 

But I haven’t ever been in a situation like this before, either. Whatever backwoods county I got myself turned around in, it likes to follow its own rules. 

For example, I didn’t pull over to pick up these hitchhikers. Somehow, they just found their way in. Or maybe I did pull over and let them in? Been so tired lately; who could even be sure. And they don’t say much, no matter how many questions I ask. Would love to know where I am, but I guess it isn’t for them to say.

My gaze again drifted, this time from the road to the car’s dashboard, and I let myself see the time. Big mistake.

7:59PM.

Nope, that ain’t right. I rapidly blinked a few times, adjusted myself so I was sitting up straighter, and then looked back to check again.

Now, it didn’t show any time at all. 

*Marty, Jesus. Focus up.* 

I blinked once more, this time for longer. Not sure how long, couldn’t been longer than ten seconds. If I close my eyes for too long, they become hard to open again. Requires a lot of energy.

4:45AM. 

See, there we go. Now *that* makes sense. By the time dawn arrives, I’m sure I will have found a gas station to pull over in. Ask for directions back to…whatever my parent’s address is. I’ll figure that out later, right now I need to focus. 

—-----------------------------------

Funny things happened in this part of the country when you didn’t focus. Sometimes, the yellow pavement markings would change colors - or disappear entirely. Other times, the road itself would start to look off - black asphalt turning to muddy brownstone at a moment’s notice. 

At first, it scared me. Scared me a lot, come to think of it. Made me want to pull over and close my eyes.

But Alice needed her nausea meds, and judging by the time, I had work in two short hours. I needed to make it home soon so I can check on her, give her a kiss before school. Hopefully, I’ll have time to brew a pot of coffee, too. 

But my eyes, they just don’t seem to want to stick with the program. Dancing around from thing to thing like they don’t have a care in the world. They have one job - watch the road for places that might have a map or someone who can tell me where I am. Well, two jobs. Watch the road *and* focus on the road. 

At least the road wasn’t treacherous. It has been pretty much straight the whole night after the wrong turn. 

—-----------------------------------

Initially, Alice was nervous about starting at her new school. And I get it - that transition is hard enough without factoring in everything she has had to manage in her short life. We’d been lucky though, finding a well-reviewed sign language school - in Idaho, of all places.  

She’s amazing - you’d think that the leukemia and the deafness from her first go with chemotherapy would have crushed her spirit. Not my Alice. She’s tough as nails. Tough as nails like her dad. 

I smiled, basking in a moment of fatherly pride. Of course, you can’t be doing that on this road. You’ll start to see things you don’t want to see. 

When my eyes again met the rearview mirror, I noticed there was now only one hitchhiker now, but he had transformed and revealed his real shape.

His face was flat like a manhole cover, almost the size of a manhole cover, too, but less circular - more oblong. He was staring at me with one bulging eye. It was the only one he had, the only one I could see at least. No other recognizable facial features. Just the one, bloated, soulless eye. 

What’s worse, I saw what was behind him. Behind the car, I mean. 

I closed my eyes as soon as I could, but my mind was already rapidly reviewing and trying to reconcile what I had seen behind the car. There was a wall a few car lengths away. No road to be seen, just an inclined wall with tire tracks on it. The atmosphere behind me had a weird thickness to it. Lightrays shone through the thickness unnaturally from someplace above. The ground looked like dust, or maybe sand, why would the ground look like -  

*FOCUS. Think of Alice, and focus*

When I finally found the courage to open my eyes, it all looked right again, and I breathed a sigh of relief and chuckled to myself from behind the wheel. Straight road in front of me, framed by a starless black sky. Everything in its right place. Until I saw something snaking its way into my peripheral vision. 

The hitchhiker was now in the passenger’s seat.

He turned to me and leaned his body forward over the stickshift; his lips were pursed and nearly pressing against my ears, rhythmically opening and closing his mouth but making no sound. I could have sworn he was close enough to touch my ear with his lips, but I guess he wasn't because I couldn’t feel it. Instead, I felt my heartbeat start to race, or I imagined what it was like to feel your heartbeat race. 

Why did I have to imagine...?

*Don’t turn. Don’t look. Don’t think. Just focus.* 

But I couldn’t. Something was wrong. I thought about closing my eyes. For a while, not just for a little. To see what would happen. I was curious what would happen. Had been all night, actually.

But then, like the angel she was, Alice’s visage appeared on the horizon. She was standing at her second-story window in my parent’s home, watching and waiting for me to return from this long night. I wasn’t getting closer for some reason, but she wasn’t getting any further away either. 

She was far, but even at that distance, I could see her doing something in the window. When I squinted, it looked like maybe she was waving.

Alice was waving at me. Alice could see me.

Must mean I'm close.

*Eyes on the road. Focus*

—-----------------------------------

Every night around 8PM, Alice would stand and watch the road from her bedroom on the second story of her grandparents' home. What she was waiting for didn’t happen as often anymore, but her birthday was a week away - the phenomenon seemed to be more frequent around her birthday. As the clock ticked into 8:03PM, she saw a familiar sight - two faint luminescent orbs traveled slowly down the deserted road in her direction, creating even fainter cylinders of light in front of them. 

Like headlights from an approaching car.

The first time this happened, Alice was nine. To cope with her father's disappearance, she would watch the road at night and pretend she saw his car returning home. One night, she saw balls of light appear in the distance, and it made hope explode through her body like fireworks. 

The balls of light turned into the driveway. And when they did, Alice noticed something that made her hope mutate into fear and confusion.

The headlights had no car attached, dissolving without a trace within seconds of their arrival.

For months, this was a nightly occurrence, and only she could see it, which scared Alice. But when she formally explained to the phenomenon to her grandfather for the first time, how they looked like headlights without a car, a weak and bittersweet grin appeared on his face, and he carefully brought up his hands to sign to her:

*I’d bet good money that’s Marty making his way home, sweetheart. He just loved you that much.*

From then on, the orbs comforted Alice and made her feel deeply connected with her long-lost father, wherever he was. But in the present, at the age of nearly seventeen, she had modified the purpose of her vigil.

Originally, she liked the idea of her father’s endless search for her. It made her feel less alone. But as she lived life and matured, she realized how alone he must be looking for her from where he was. Now, all she wanted was for Marty to stop looking. She wanted her father to finally rest. 

Now, when the orbs passed by, she would sign to them from her window, desperately hopeful that even from where he was, he could see her hands move and communicate an important message to him:

*I love you, and I miss you. But please, Dad, let go.*

1gufw6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/InternalFamilySystems/comments/1gufw6f/2_years_in/,2 years in,"Hi all, I'm the original author of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternalFamilySystems/comments/ykd1fb/holy_fucking_shit/), and I wanted to do a ""2 years in"" checkup. Although, to be fair, part of me intended to make a post after each session, both to guide and help others who were new understand how such a journey would work, and to account for my own progress. I eventually didn't because part of me felt like it was oversharing and I wanted to keep a lot of stuff private.

This post is then an extension of that.

First things first, a part of me cringes a little reading that post back. I can tell how much I was blended with a part that needed IFS to work, to be real, to be the thing tht would save me. (Cause if it wouldn't, what would right?) this is something I've worked on and still have work to do on, but it's much different now.

One of the main differences between then and now is just how quickly I notice (and notice truly, I'm very mental oriented and many of my parts were coping cognitively, many parts have tried doing the job of noticing or suspecting other parts of being blended with me) when I'm blended with a part. Just now I noticed how I was writing from a part that cares a lot about writing in a compelling way, using connected and concise paragraphs, to make a better post, to inspire people better (and much more). But I was able to see it, ask it to step away, and let it know it'd have more impact if I wrote from the heart. This kind of stuff happens much more often now and much more easily. It's good.

The first year was harsh. I initially started IFS because I had gone through a pretty agitated breakup and part of me thought ""there must be something wrong with me for things to go this wrong"", and although part of me doesn't like that language, she definitely was pointing at something real: I had a lot of work to do.

Every session I would come in with a new problem, cry about it, help it out a little, and come back out. In between sessions, I was suffering, not just from the breakup, but from all the suffering that was always there that I was finally starting to notice.

At times, it definitely felt hopeless. Oftentimes, I would end the session saying I didn't feel like I got to do the changes I wanted to do, and I would think often I was just wasting money and time. A part of me is proud I pushed through. I didn't fully trust that any change was possible. A part of me would be scared this was all just made up shit and another part had to remind it that IFS is recognized as an evidence-based therapy in the US (that fact helped). I also held on because I trusted that my therapist was acting from her heart. She genuinely wanted to help me and genuinely cared about me and her work, and I could sense that, I could sense that there was something real in this.

Eventually though, and mostly in the last six months. I've had to make myself trust this less and less. There is this one post on this subreddit, I can't find it right now, where they use as a metaphor the foam in some coffee being the parts stuck in their roles doing their best, but they are obscuring the still water (coffee) beneath (the self), and every bubble that ""pops"" (relaxes into a better role) allows more of that surface to come through. I've found it's a lot like that. Eventually, all those tiny incremental ""quantitative"" changes added up and lead to what I perceive to be a qualitative change.

Like, oh my fucking God. I can't tell you how much better it is and how much better I feel now. It's night and day. There's just that sense I sometimes get that everything will be okay, that I, and everyone else, is fundamentally a good person. I'm no longer paralyzed by shame about being the worst person ever. I'm much less scared of being abandoned, irrelevant to my friends, because I know that the ones I have now find me valuable. This isn't something I'd let myself believe before.

A part of me wants to give caution though: although I am miles ahead of the person I was two years ago, so much work remains to be done. I still get a big ache in my heart sometimes that I can't explain. Similar stuff happens in my throat. I get weekends where I feel ashamed, useless and where I end up doing nothing but scroll reddit and jerk off. I'm still not able to be fully honest to my girlfriend about how I feel about her, what I want from her etc, because a part of me's still afraid she'll stop loving me or we'll have to leave each other because of what I say or feel.

But the huge difference is, now I feel like these are just problems, instead of life-threatening threats, that make me a fundamentally bad person for having those beliefs about myself or holding those feelings. There's a trust I'll be able to do something about it now. Maybe in a year, two years, three years, I'll stop worrying about this or that (though I'm sure other issues will prop up by then, but hey, part of the fun right?).

Of course, this is just one story among many, so your mileage may vary, but I hope someone new to IFS reads this and it both gives them hope, and manages their expectations. If this post helped you in any way, I'd love for you to leave a comment about it, it always feels good to know that what I wrote into my phone mattered to someone.

A part of me still wanted me to mention how it's only two years in that I got one of my most meaningful experiences yet no later than last week. For what I think might've been the first time, I fully bathed in that feeling of pure, unconditional love that my Self (I) have towards my parts. It's so powerful and so profoundly real. It's that true sense of ""there is nothing you could do that could possibly make me stop loving you"" that I felt towards one (and all) of my parts. And it genuinely moved me to know I had this in me, that I was capable of such a thing. I didn't believe I could do that. It was fucking great. 

TLDR: I feel much better about myself and my life than I did 2 years ago when I made that post. IFS isn't magic, but it's pretty darn close.",2,1731964828.0,InternalFamilySystems,1,1.0,False
1gufuq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPS/comments/1gufuq4/why_cant_my_package_be_delivered/,Why can’t my package be delivered?,"Been waiting for my coffee table to get delivered for the last 2 days. It was supposed to come Sunday I was home all day - got notification delivery was attempted and would reschedule delivery for today between 11-3. 

Today at 1:02 I got a notification that delivery was again attempted and that my delivery is now scheduled for tomorrow. 

Why can’t my package be delivered? I live in an apartment complex on the 3rd floor. There is a gate to the building but I have the call box information listed so the driver can call when they arrive and I can let them up. 

I haven’t gotten a call, a text or anything regarding the driver not being able to access my building. Is it not process to call the customer if you can’t get to the delivery address? 

I don’t think this is the problem here, as I have provided my phone number and call box number. I’m under the impression the driver doesn’t want to bring my package upstairs - which I understand it’s a 60 pound table..but why not atleast call so I can come down and grab it?

My complex does have Amazon lockers but if the package doesn’t fit it has to be delivered to the customers door. 

I call support they say I can pick up the package at a UPS location for $5.99 but damn why do I gotta pay to pick up a package that I already paid for to have delivered to my door? 

I just want my package lol! I don’t know what to do at this point as I feel the same issue will happen tomorrow when it’s time to deliver my package.

I’ve had a whole big ass couch delivered right to my door by UPS before no issues. I don’t understand what the problem now is.",0,1731964729.0,UPS,2,0.5,False

Did I play myself? ,"Took on a Nelson bench and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out with the exception of one thing. There's some side-to-side racking happening when you sit on it. The legs are attached with 4-5 2inch screws. Once the racking started I thought I could quiet it down with two horizontal braces running under the seat connecting each leg with a lap joint and also running screws into the rails along the run. 

It still moves.

I suspect I know the issue, but would like to know what the group says. I was planning on this bench living outside, so I, in my infinite wisdom, thought it should be made from cedar. I used western red cedar and while it was miserably splintery and soft everything came together well. 

Did I play myself with this wood selection? Is it too damned soft to withstand being a weight bearing item with the joinery used? 

I've already resigned myself to it either being a fancy plant stand or replacing the legs and making it a coffee table, but want to know where I went wrong here.

Girl 1 - is nice and funny, we have good conversation - conversation isn’t as regular over text as I’d like but I know she’s busy and this is our dynamic but we do talk every day. From the first date she’s been keen to arrange follow up dates and we have a good chemistry but I’m not 100% sure if there’s enough chemistry there for me.

Girl 2 - is not available for a relationship, she’s made it clear that she only wants casual and casual isn’t what I’m looking for, however we talk everyday pretty much all day and the conversation never gets dry, we flirt so much and even have pet names for each other, she knows I want more but she doesn’t want to stop talking? She’s been round to my house a few times, once just to bring me coffee because I was tired, the sexual chemistry between us is incredible and I’m so attracted to her but also the conversation is just so easy and comfortable. I literally today have not heard from her and it’s driven me crazy waiting by my phone…

I know that I’m not dating either of them so I don’t know why I think I feel like I need to make a decision? My head knows girl 1 is the obvious choice because there’s no drama but my heart really wants girl 2 and I’m scared that I’m setting myself up for heartbreak with girl 2 because she is constantly on my mind - but I think I’m secretly hoping that she’s changing her mind and will give me more.

Or do I let myself just have fun with both, get to know girl 1 things might grow and once it’s time to talk relationships make a decision - if we get to relationship stage. I don’t want to also hurt anyone else’s feelings

Feel free to rant about your own In the comments ,"Buried deep is set 20 years after a Super weapon Poisoned the earth and air forcing the two warring factions to retreat underground with heavy losses. Locations on map. 1. Kaiserholm. The kaisers army retreated into the ancient catacombs beneath them. Over time they expanded the caves becoming the most prosperous faction with the best army. Its Capital is Berlis with its Total population being 10500 with an army of 2050. 2. On the other side of a great poisoned lake is the caves of the Le Duche. The leader driven mad renamed it the Empire and made it start worshiping the ancient gods. They have a population of 20000 with an army of 5000. Their fanatical beliefs make them shun technology even gas masks training with metal spears Swords and bows dressing in Ancient armour. 3. The Republicain. Some members of the Duche realising the Dangers of this fanaticism collapsed a cave entrance and founded their own nation keen on Old Duche beliefs. They have a population of 5000 with an army of 1500. Unlike their mad brothers they value technology and are some of the greatest engineers and scientists in the deep. 4. No man’s land. The mame given to the surface. It’s ruined and Corrupted by the Endless war. With burnt or dry trees ruined buildings and Monsters roaming around. Scavengers are occasionally sent to retrieve valuable supplies. 5.  Infernum curriculun. A large corrupted pit rumoured to be where the super weapon struck. Its mere presence Is Erie and many monsters roam about. Teams are sent to mine the valuable sulfur modes around it. 6. The Anciene Capitale. The greatest city of the Duche lays ruined under the Dirt and sand. It has many buildings to scavenge and loot. There’s tunnels from the caves leading to it where Skirmishes often occur. 7. Terminas aetuarus. The large cliffs separating No man’s land from the sea. It’s rumoured that The very super weapon taht caused all this was Researched inside a secret bunker inside. 8. Polluted sea. The sea was not spared from the Corruption its waters turning green and murky. Nothing but Sea monsters and Eroding islands. Many caves of the kaiser stretch into it mining underneath. Monsters. Fleshy. Fleshes are those who were exposed to the super weapon during its release. They look human but are Skinless and Empty Eye sockets. Their tattered clothes cling to them as they hunt for food. They travel in packs and use bits of scrap for weapons like a shard of glass. Scarabee. A general term used to describe large cockroaches and beetles mutated to the size of dogs. They aren’t the most dangerous but travel in large swarms. Some have been domesticated and form a vital food source in the deep. Tobblablu. A large Beetle the size of a cow. It Lives in caves hanging over the polluted sea and in wet dark parts of the Deep. It can use a Akaline Mucus to burn flesh and It’s sharp pincers to tear it away. Its shell is resistant to low calibre bullets and blunt melee. Miscellaneous stuff. Weaponry. Weaponry hasn’t advanced much since the Emdless war with most army’s (with the exception of the Imperiale) using Bolt actions, early SMG’s (MP18 and Fedrova Automat style) Machine guns and Artillery. Vehicles are rare with the most common being Bikes with sidecars (on military bikes it’s armoured and has a machine gun) or crude Armoured carsmade of Stamped melted Scrap steel. Food. Food in the deep is largely made up of Mushrooms due to their ability to grow without light. UV grown vegetables are also available with meat being limited to Bug (tastes like Greasy slightly bitter chicken) Rat (tastes like beef) or Proper animals if you want to splurge like Chicken or Cow. The only owners of cows and chickens in the deep are the richest in the entire deep. Other common products include Substitute coffee made of UV grown Chicory. Moonshine.

Everything is wired up and the Silvia turns on, but the PID display doesn't.  
I'm reading 11.8V on the pins (wired to the ON/OFF switch of the Silvia). Is this correct?

I have been getting a lot of messages from people asking what has happened since my update #2, since I said I wasn't going to update... well surprise! lol

My ex and I have been going out, and it has been nice. It has been casual things so far, coffee, lunch, breakfast, etc. No going to each other's houses and no dinner.

I don't really know what this means, I have no idea if he is wanting to try again or what we are doing, but frankly, I will be OK with either option. I am OK. I was happy single, and I am happy in a relationship.

I am posting this not to rub it in, but to give some advice.

When your ex leaves, and you go NC, I know it hurts SO bad. I know it feels like you're going to die. I remember laying on my floor crying, in agony. 

However, I made new friends, I joined new hobbies, I went through a lot of therapy and worked on my anxious attachment. I am OK without him. However, I want him in my life. He is a want, not a need.

I only forgave him after he proved to me he was sorry and gave me an explanation of what happened. I would never have spoken to him again if he didn't do that.

So, lovely people, please, take your pride, stick to NC and heal. You deserve it. ",12,1731963731.0,ExNoContact,4,1.0,False

I purchased the Fenty pro filter setting powder(coffee) last year and I’m NOW just starting to actually use it. I watched the actual fenty tutorial and I saw Rihanna putting it all over her face, but I saw another video that said not to use setting powder all over your face, and to use a lighter setting powder under the eyes to set your concealer. I’m super confused on the proper way to use it without looking patchy or it messing up my makeup. How do I use setting powders? Or am I supposed to be using other powders outside of it? Thank you.

I am American myself and I just genuinely do not understand how people can eat the way they do and go on functioning. Maybe I have a weak stomach but if I eat junk food or fast food I’m basically out of commission for the evening. Extreme lethargy and stomach cramping. 

I eat extremely healthy and I’ve had a kidney stone at 25 because of too much oxalates (found in vegetables) and sodium. Now I drink 2L of water every day to avoid that ever happening again. There’s absolutely no way most people are drinking close to that much water. I rarely drink soda too but regularly have coffee. 

Actually, forget about Americans, don’t Asians have insane amounts of sodium with each meal? Don’t they have problems with that? Seemingly not??

I’m a teacher and I have a ton of black/ Hispanic kids come into school at 7am eating a large bag of hot Cheetos or takis almost every day. There is literally no way I could even finish 1/2 off a bag without throwing up. This is genuinely concerning to me. There is no way these kids aren’t going to have colon cancer right? They are literally ingesting red40 slop daily and in insane quantities.

1guf6ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1guf6ht/gi_and_fatigue_issues/,GI and fatigue Issues,"Hello all. I've been frequenting this sub for some time since I've been feeling the way that I do. I'm not even sure what I want out of this post, maybe putting everything down to vent or see if others have gone through what I have and provide help/guidance. 

I know this is going to be a lot but I wanted to list everything from start to current and add details of tests.

I'm a 37 M living in the US. 6'3 225lbs. I'd consider myself healthy and active prior to all of this I'm very active, I play men's league hockey, I'm also outdoors quite a bit (hunting/fishing) I walk a lot and mountain bike. 

I was also a light drinker (beer, typically on weekends) and I used to vape. 

Now into the details... There's going to be some gross details, fair warning.

I'll put a tldr at the end too.

- August 16th 2024 I picked up lunch at a local pizzeria, later that day I had to run to the store to grab some last minute items as I was leaving for vacation the next day. On the way home I got a horrible stomach ache, one where I didn't think I was going to make it home in time. Luckily I did, I ran to the bathroom and it was pure hell. Straight water consistency and a horrific smell. After that I felt perfectly fine. 

- August 17th 2024 felt perfectly fine, got on my plane and got to my destination, got into my rental car and started noticing shortness of breath, like I couldn't get a full breath of air, but it wasn't too bad so I didn't think too much about it. 

Around the middle of my vacation, I started to get upper abdomen bloating, that contributed to the shortness of breath, I also had another episode of diarrhea that I had before I left. The bloating was getting worse after I would eat. 

- August 30th 2024 first day home, I wake up feeling incredibly nauseous, I had zero appetite and felt fatigued, my legs felt like jello. I end up throwing up bile/phlegm and the remainder of the day I felt like garbage. 

My stool is diarrhea/loose golden yellow in color.

- August 31st I go to urgent care as I was starting to get a burning sensation in my upper abdomen, specifically right below my sternum/breast bone, my appetite was completely gone. Urgent care did basically nothing for me, they gave me this numbing cocktail and told me to go buy Prilosec since I probably have gastritis. I ended up getting Prilosec took it for a few days and stopped since I was getting worse.

-September 3rd 2024 symptoms were not improving and it started to freak me out so I opted to drive myself to the ER. 

The emergency room performed the following

-CT scan
- X-ray 
-Ultra sound (gallbladder, pancreas, liver) 
-EKG
-Urinalysis
- Blood work 

Results: blood work came back clean with slight elevated bilirubin (1.4) and AST was 76 but ALT was normal at 45. Lipase was a tad low at 9, it says the range was 11-82. But no one seemed worried about the results. 

Imaging results were also clean, the CT scan picked up slight fatty liver and bladder walls thickening.

""Normal stomach, small bowel, appendix, and colon. Urinary bladder wall thickening. Normal prostate gland.""

""Lung bases are clear, heart normal in size, normal gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys. No hydronephrosis no lymphadenopathy.""

I was discharged and was told I would be better served by my PCP. 

- September 18th 2024 finally get seen by my PCP, my symptoms are still the same, nausea, fatigue, no appetite, if I tried to eat I would feel full immediately/early satiety. PCP orders c diff, ova and parasites and salmonella shigella test.... This is all negative

- September 20th 2024 PCP orders cbc blood test. 
Blood results: bilirubin 1.6, AST 60 ALT 37. Platelets drop from 164 to 107. Everything else is in range. 

I also asked for a hepatitis panel (everything came back negative).

September 21st 2024 this is when shit hit the fan and I received new symptoms. 

I now developed horrible bad acid reflux. It would wake up me up night, I also developed frequent urination. Urine was golden/amber in color regardless of how much I drank. I would bend over to pick something up and I would throw up bile. My appetite is still gone. I'm getting no sleep, once I was woken up, that was it. Eyes are bloodshot. I wake up in cold sweats, I have chills, anxiety is maxed out, brain fog is more and more frequent. And now I'm experiencing UTI/prostatitis like symptoms. It would burn when I would urinate, felt like my bladder was always full, I felt like I had a golf ball in my ass, it was pure misery.

At this point my weight is 205lbs. I've dropped 20lbs in a month. 


My PCP then prescribes me famotidine and pantoprazole. I take the famotidine once every night, never touched the pantoprazole though since I had concerns since it was a ppi and I've read horror stories on the gastritis sub.

September 24th 2024 I have my first appt with a GI doctor. I explain everything that has been happening. I'm going through everything in detail, about 10 minutes in he turns to me and asks ""did anyone test you for COVID?"" I said no, he seemed very disgruntled that urgent care or the ER didn't test, but I didn't even consider COVID since I've had it before a few times and knew (or so I thought) what to look for. 

He explained that he's seeing a fair bit of people with COVID having GI issues. I've convinced myself at this point I have parasites or a bad stomach bug, but doctor isn't convinced. We book an endoscopy on Sept 27th.

September 27th 2024 I have my endoscopy (a different doctor performed the exam). I wake up, doctor comes in and says ""you have mild gastritis and mild esophagitis, but everything looks good"". 

Ok, at this point I'm thinking, I'll just heal my gastritis and hope to be out of this hell. That same day I have some what of an appetite. Up to this point I've been living off of ensure and boost so I attempt to eat something easy. 

- October 4th 2024 I get a call from the doctor that performed my endoscopy. She says ""when I spoke with you that day I mentioned you had gastritis and esophagitis, well I re-reviewed and you don't, everything is clean"". At this point I'm beyond frustrated because I think I had a diagnosis, now I'm being told everything is good. Mind you, I already had my biopsy results since I called and had then emailed to me. Everything came back clean and no h pylori.

October 11th 2024 HIDA scan, I pushed to have this done because I wanted to make absolutely sure my gallbladder was not causing these issues.

October 13th 2024 my appetite is starting to actually come back. My upper abdomen pain/burning is basically gone and acid reflux is no longer a concern. I'm feeling more optimistic at this point. My prostatitis/UTI symptoms are in full swing 24/7 but at this point I'm just happy I can tolerate some food. This is where I branched off to other food items as I was only eating bland chicken, fish, rice or quinoa. I can now tolerate a good bit of food, spicy food is still a no go, fatty foods don't really settle either. 

October 17th 2024 that feeling of a golf ball is stuck in my rectum, is completely gone, the urinary symptoms are getting a little better. I'm still waking up 2-3 times a night and struggling to fall back asleep. But I feel like progress is being made. 

October 18th 2024 follow up blood work
Results: bilirubin still at 1.6, AST dropped to 43 and ALT 33, doctor was happy to see liver enzymes basically in normal range. Platelets dropped to 104 however.

PCP wants me to see a hematologist for the platelets, waiting for that appointment. 


October 24th 2024 I ask my PCP for vitamin test and Lyme disease test. 

Vitamins are all in perfect range except for vitamin D,  27ml normal range is 30, so not really a deficiency. 

Lyme test was interesting. It came back negative on the igg and igm blot but says I was reactive on band 41kd igg and band 39 kd igg. I followed up on that and my PCP said that I needed 5 reactive, etc and told me I do not have Lymes.(I tried to research on my own and ended up on the lyme subreddit, that was not good for my mental health since basically if any bands came back positive I had Lymes and I would have to pay for a Lyme literate doctor out of pocket and take herbs, etc.) At least this is how I interpreted it. 

November 12th 2024 colonoscopy. This was a mess, they had me do a one day prep, I get put under and woke up being told I'm not completely cleared out. Wonderful, so I have this rescheduled on the 27th.

One thing I want to mention, 100% of the tests I've gotten was because of me pushing for them. My PCP office has been really dismissive, they even made a comment about my weight loss ""you need to eat protein"". I felt as if I was dismissed, only one of the nurse practitioner actually listened to my concerns and went in with my HIDA scan and additional blood work.

My GI doctor is a ghost. Will not return my calls, I only spoke with him twice, the initial appointment and my colonoscopy. I had to convince his office to book a colonoscopy, which I got thankfully.



Tldr - got sick at the end of August, tons of GI issues, some issues went away, new issues popped up, I feel like I'm playing roulette with my symptoms, not getting any diagnosis or clear answers. I've had a ton of tests done, nothing is coming back conclusive. 

Notes: 
I've done some sort of exercise daily since this began, i.e. walking around the block, trying not to over do it, even though I might some days.

My golden yellow diarrhea stopped on 9/21 
I now have constipation mixed with normal stool, normal brown color. It still seems off, it has this smell to it I can't quite explain. When I went from diarrhea to solid it was sticky/mucus. Now there's cloudy mucus on the harder stools but the rest seems fine?

I do take Lexapro, strange thing here was I quit a few months prior to this happening, the reason why I quit was because I had horrible/morbid thoughts about death/dying, I started to have dreams about bad things happening to people I cared about. I assumed it was some crazy reaction to my medication so I stopped. It was so bad that I was manufacturing scenarios in my head and stressing myself out. After I got sick, I went back on but bumped to 20mg. I tried that for a month, it turned me into a zombie and now I'm back at 10mg. I've read some stories of people getting really bad anxiety because of this, so maybe it wasn't my medication like I had thought.

Things I've cut out/quit:
Alcohol
Coffee
Vaping/nicotine 
Spicy food

Things I've added: 
Kiefer
Kombucha
Yogurt
Daily men's vitamins
Raw sour kraut (this give me horrible gas so I had to cut) 
Collagen peptides

Symptoms: 
Bloating (this has gotten better) 
Burning upper abdomen (completely gone) 
Diarrhea (gone) 
Constipation 
Shortness of breath (has gotten much better) 
Fatigue/muscle weakness (still happening) 
Pins/needles (almost gone, but the flares are gnarly)
Nausea (almost completely gone)
Loss of appetite (almost completely gone)
Dry mouth (almost completely gone) 
Anxiety/panic (comes in waves less frequent) 
Lightheaded/headache (almost completely gone) 
Frequent urination (almost completely gone) 
Middle and lower back pain
Insomnia/bad sleep (still happening)
Random itchiness 

Essentially today, my lower abdomen is a mess, it's really hard to explain the feeling, but it's kind of like when you're dropping from a roller coaster or if you've been punched in the gut, all the time and like someone is squeezing my lower intestines.

Muscle weakness, more intense in the arms/shoulders, legs/groin. 

I also used to have pins and needles in my hands/feet but that has eased a bit. 

Sleep is still shit. I wake up once a night to pee, but I can actually go back to bed now, I am thankful for this compared to where I was. My eyes are blood shot when I wake up and feel dry, but a few eye drops and that clears up

Lump in my throat, no idea what this is about, but it does not really bother me a whole lot. 

I just feel exhausted all the time now, if I do any activities I get sore and recovery is longer. I have zero drive to do anything. 

I forget basic words when I'm talking, like I know what I want to say, it just does not come out.

This is something really strange that I can't explain though. I still play hockey. Once a week for an hour. While I am playing I feel 100% perfect. I don't get winded easily, my muscles feel good. After the fact I feel like I got hit by a bus and takes days to recover.    

I honestly have no idea if COVID did this to me, my GI doctor seemed to think so, or something post viral. I have a fraction of energy I used to have, I have no interest in the things I like, my anxiety is up and down. I'm at a loss and honestly have no idea what to do. I still have my colonoscopy next week, hematologist this week and I a urologist the first week of December.

I guess if anyone has experienced what I'm dealing with, has any success or recovery stories, I'd appreciate it. I know this post is kind of all over the place so I apologize for the rambling and format. ",3,1731963049.0,covidlonghaulers,4,1.0,False

1guf5wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1guf5wv/paramount_apartments/,Paramount Apartments,"First off, my name is Oliver Wyatt, and ever since I was a little kid, I always wanted to be a police officer. I got an intense amount of pride out of the idea of upholding the law and being someone of authority. As a kid, I would run around my front yard, waving a toy revolver at imaginary bad guys like I was dirty Harry. That might sound like a tremendous cliché, and it probably is, but it’s my life. So, after high school, I picked up a minimum wage job until I was old enough to sign up for the police academy. Looking back, I wish I had stayed at that greasy burger place 15 minutes from my house. 

After 22 weeks of (not exactly intensive) training, I graduated and finally achieved my dream. Dad couldn't have been more proud, and mom couldn’t have been more terrified. I tried to console her, but even I was sweating a little. I will admit that years of anticipation began to climax in fear. Fear that all my ambition would get me is bullets flying in my direction. Only to see *myself* on the evening news, all of my dreams blowing up in my face. I have to say though that the first few weeks were more boring than I expected, even disappointing to some degree. Driving around dealing with car accidents, domestic abuse calls, and busy bodies welding cell phones like weapons. None of it scratched the itch for justice that I was looking for. I wanted some action! Some shit that you might see on numerous daytime TV cop shows. I was so naive.  If I had any sense, I would have listened to *Carter*. 

Carter Halpert was my old partner. He was an older man with a massive white mustache that would have put Nietzsche to shame. He had straight gray hair that was cut just above his shoulder and piercing green eyes that seemed to suck the truth out of any situation. All that and his thick Georgia accent that made him feel like the grandfather everyone wanted in their youth. The man genuinely carried himself like an old west sheriff, something that became quite clear whenever he scolded me for my action-hungry attitude. Or, whenever he scolded anyone for that matter. He always told me that I should consider myself lucky that I hadn’t seen something truly messed up, and maybe never would if I played my cards right. I knew he was right, even back then I knew that he was right. But I always wanted more action. I wanted to feel like I was doing a service.   

At first, this seemed like it was finally going to be one of *those* calls. Someone apparently heard gunshots at an apartment complex out in the middle of nowhere. It was called Paramount Apartments. I knew the address was odd. It was way out of town, seemingly right next to the highway —a more fitting place for a chain hotel, not an apartment complex. 

“Who the fuck is living next to the highway in the middle of nowhere?” I asked Carter, perhaps a bit more vulgar than I should have been. I remember that Carter made a face, a piercing scowl that I hadn't seen on him before, as he stared off into the distance. I wanted to ask him what he was thinking, but before I could say anything, he grabbed his radio.

“10-4, squad car on route.” Just like that, Carter made a few quick adjustments, and we were off with our lights and sirens blaring. I was almost positive it was some old woman calling about a kid’s video game being too loud or something like that. But I had hoped it would be something interesting. We drove for about 12 minutes before we came to the next exit. I can’t remember any exit signs, but then GPS just made us peel off at an exit that seemed to come out of nowhere. The road turned off seemingly into the forest. It was a more drastic turn than I had expected. I braced myself like a child expecting a crash, but Carter took the turn like a seasoned stunt driver. He seemed to chuckle at my sudden panic, only to focus back on the road as we disappeared into the forest. The road came to a sudden fork in the road at a flashing red light. A stop light that illuminated two roads going in opposite directions.

“Recalculating.” The GPS sounded. I turned to look at the GPS, and I wanted to say something. I knew the GPS shouldn’t have needed to reboot. Did we make a wrong turn somewhere?  I really wanted to say something. But I knew Carter was determined at this point, so I shut myself up. He made the right, and I found myself holding my breath as the red light drifted off into the distance. Carter made a right and continued down the dark road, with the red light blinking behind us. 

I looked out my window to try and catch my bearings as we drove. I thought we were in some kind of forest. The intense black surrounding us could only be explained by a dense forest in the dark of midnight. But as I looked around, I realized we were driving through a town. I thought I could see buildings of some kind, but with no streetlights and no lights on, I couldn't be sure. I tried to focus on the shapes moving past my window. They didn't look like they had any depth to them, like the silhouettes of buildings where they should have been. My eyes were quickly drawn to a bright light that seemed to appear right in front of me. The road suddenly opened up into a well-lit parking lot— a medium size parking lot with way too many lights for the space. I felt like I was under fluorescent office lights when I was outdoors. It also didn't take me long to notice that the parking lot was completely surrounded by trees. I could have sworn that the parking lot was surrounded by other buildings, but they seemed to lose their shape when we got out of the car. A well-lit apartment building with at least 15 floors sat at one end of the parking lot. I was confused as to how the two of us hadn't seen the building sooner. Sitting behind the tacky water feature was a sign that read, “Paramount Apartments.”

“Be alert. Something is wrong.” I nodded as Carter parked the squad car. I was at least happy he was just as weirded out as me.  

 When Carter and I pulled up to the building, there was a man in his mid-40s standing out front. He was dressed in a pair of cargo shorts, a pink polo, white sneakers, and Oakley sunglasses worn backwards. The man looked like some HOA asshole going through a midlife crisis. It was like all my worst fears were confirmed at once. This was some middle-aged entitled prick complaining about children. Or something else he happened to mistake for gunshots. In any other situation, the man wouldn't have raised any suspicion – and he certainly didn't beyond my first thought. But now I find myself looking for anything, any clue that could have let me know what was going to happen next. 

“Oh, thank God,” he said with seemingly genuine concern on his face, “I heard gunshots in apartment 307. I think someone might be hurt!” Carter and I glanced at each other before looking at the man skeptically.

“Do you live here, sir?” Carter asked, realizing we still had no idea who this guy was or what his business was here.

“My name is Matt Miller, and I am the building manager. I have been getting complaints about this room for a few months now. They seem like good folks–a nice family. They pay the rent on time, but a couple times a week, I get a complaint about fighting and screaming coming from that room. Then when I go to check on them, it always seems to be over and everyone is all smiles. I've never actually heard the fighting for myself and no one ever seemed to be hurt. ” He explained as Carter raised his eyebrow. 

“Please take us to the apartment, sir,” Carter said calmly. The man nodded and led us inside. He pushed a few buttons on a keypad; the door system let out a loud screech, and he let us inside through a dirty and somewhat bare lobby. I couldn't help but think the room was  absurdly small, with no chairs for anyone to sit in. One side of the room had an elevator, the other had an open door leading to a flight of stairs. The man calling himself Matt then ushered us into the elevator and pressed the button for the third floor. I then turned to him.

“But why have you never called the authorities to deal with it before?” I asked, wondering why I had never heard of this building before or even heard the address on a debriefing.

“Like I said, I have never actually heard the fighting myself or seen anyone hurt. I don’t go into people's private lives.” The incompetence of this manager started to get on my nerves. The elevator opened, revealing a long, cramped hallway with sickly green carpeting and dozens of doors on both sides. The green of the carpet struck me: it was the same green as dirty pond water and the smell wasn't too far off. I had to stop myself from gagging and Carter was right behind me in that regard. Many of the lights were flickering or were out altogether. The lights bathed the whole hallway in a piercing light, the color of movie theater popcorn butter. I couldn't help but notice dead insects inside the bulbs, but then I noticed some were alive. There were so many. The live ones seemed to be crawling over each other–and the dead ones–in a desperate attempt to get out. It was then that I noticed the bugs crawling on the wall. Every dark point on the wall seemed to move the more I looked at them. From that point on, I did my best to stay in the middle of the cramped hallway. The whole place seemed like it was falling apart, and I wanted nothing more than to get out of there. As the man calling himself Matt led the two of us down the hallway, a question popped into my head.  

“Does that mean you heard the gunshot?” I asked, Matt turned and looked at me. 

“The entire building heard it! I got so many complaints from scared parents over the apartment group chat that I just told everyone to stay in their rooms, and I would call the police.” Nothing about this situation was making sense. This building didn't feel like the kind of place where anyone would come to build a family. We finally made it to apartment 307. Carter looked at Matt.

“Stand back, sir. We don't know what might have happened.” Matt took a couple of steps back into the shadows of the hallway. Carter took point and knocked on the door. 

“Sir or Madam, this is the police. Could you please open the door?” We waited for a few moments before Carter knocked on the door again. Considerably harder this time. 

“Sir or Madam, we got a call about gunshots. Please open the door. We need to know if anyone is hurt.” 

This time, we were given an answer in the form of a piercing female scream that made my ears ring. The voice didn't say anything understandable, but it was all Carter needed to start kicking the door in. 

“That sounds like the mother! You need to do something!!” Matt yelled, letting his panic slip and turning my attention away from Carter and the door.  

“We will sir! Now get back!” He backed up considerably. I heard Carter break through the door right behind me. The door broke much faster than I expected, even for a crumbling apartment building like this. I didn't even hear a door chain break.

“What the fuck?” Carter said from inside the apartment. He had rushed in without me while I was dealing with Matt's emotional outburst. 

“Stay here, sir!” I demanded before rushing in after Carter. I ran in with my gun drawn to see what Carter was confused about. As I ran in, I could have sworn I saw Matt smiling. I know I only saw it for a second, but his smile looked wrong… like something you might see on a crudely-made puppet. Like a marionette infested with termites and forgotten about. When I found Carter, he was standing in the middle of the living room looking dumbfounded. I’ll admit, it took me a second to see what he saw. The apartment was seemingly a normal space with a living room and kitchen area, a bathroom, and a bedroom. However, as I looked more closely, I noticed it. The apartment was empty. I mean, it had furniture and everything you'd find in any normal apartment, but any evidence that a family had lived there for any amount of time was absent. No shoes by the front door, no dishes in the sink, and every framed photo in the place was a stock image of a family. But never the same family. Even the smell of the place seemed neutral. Not one smell stood out as a dominant smell in the room. I couldn't smell the carpet, in a place like this I had expected to smell the carpet. Everything in the room just seemed way too clean and neat. Carter directed me towards the bedroom. Clearly, the scream we heard must have been coming from there. We stood on either side of the door, and I spoke first. 

“Miss, are you hurt?” I wasn't sure what, but something about this felt truly wrong. When we didn't get an answer, Carter opened the unlocked door. A part of me was expecting a woman tied to the bed by her abusive husband while said husband held a gun to her head, as their children sat in the corner terrified. I wish to god that’s what I saw. I certainly wasn't expecting  more of what we found in the living room. What stood in front of us was a completely immaculate bedroom. Carter practically ran to the closet and threw it open, checked the closet only to find it completely empty, he then frantically checked the dresser. Nothing, not even a pair of socks. I was still standing in the doorway when Carter brushed past me and moved towards the kitchen. 

“Go find that manager guy,” He pointed at the door before rummaging through the shelves and cupboards of the kitchen. “Nothing, absolutely nothing.” I heard him mutter under his breath as I made my way out of the apartment. 

“Sir, are you sure this is the right roo-” I was about to finish my sentence when I stepped out into the hallway and saw no one. I thought that Matt was standing right outside, but now he was nowhere to be seen. “Sir! We need to ask you a few questions!” I yelled down the long hallway thinking he was just out of my sight, hiding at one of the dark ends of the hallway. A hall that was now too dark for me to see the end with the naked eye. I yelled again, but I got no response. I even took out my flashlight and aimed it down both ends of the hallway. I quietly wondered if the hallway had always been this dark. Sure, it was dingy before, but now… now I couldn’t see to the end of the hall without my flashlight. There was just nothing there. I went back in to tell Carter, and I found him with his hands on his hips, looking both confused and royally pissed off. 

“Well, where is he!?” Carter yelled, clearly exasperated. I didn't know what to tell him, so I just told him the truth.

“He’s gone.” 

Carter looked at me as if I grew two heads. 

“What do you mean he’s gone?” he questioned, walking past me, presumably to check the hallway himself, only to return a few moments later. He came back just as quickly, “did you tell him he could leave?”I shook my head.

“Well, there is nobody here. There isn't even any evidence of someone being here. So, either that guy took us to the wrong room, or he’s playing us both for fools.” 

“But we both heard that scream.” I confirmed, mostly for myself. A sudden spark of realization formed in Carter’s eye. 

“THE BATHROOM!” he cursed our collective stupidity. We rushed towards the bathroom and I swung open the door. The first thing that hit us was the smell. The sudden stench of rot, decay, and death traveled at top speed through the apartment assaulting our nostrils. It was so pungent I wondered how neither of us smelled this mess sooner. After the two of us finished gagging, we collected ourselves as best we could. I reached into the room, looking for a light switch, and was immediately met with a malformed, spongy substance that I immediately recoiled from. When I looked at my hand, a black soapy liquid had covered my fingers where I touched the wall. Carter and I looked at my hand in disbelief, before Carter took out his flashlight and pointed it into the bathroom. Every surface in that room was covered in a thick black substance– a black substance that seemed to pulse, weave, twitch, like the muscles of a rotting animal fighting to stay alive. At first glance I thought it must have been mold, but it didn't seem to cover the walls, it looked like it was one with the walls. Almost like it was pushing itself out from the walls. Like it was always just below the surface, distorting the walls and floors into new shapes before pushing free. Like giant termite mounds made out of black, moldy muscle. My training would tell me to investigate further; however, neither of us needed to step foot in the room, because in plain view was the body of an older woman decaying in the bathtub. 

“We need to call someone.” I had never seen a dead body in person before, and despite the fact I knew who to call, the name escaped me in my panic. Carter pulled out his radio and immediately spoke into it. I can’t recall what he said, I was too busy staring at the woman in the bathtub. I am no coroner, but I had to guess she had been there for multiple years, if not more. Her skin was gray and much of it seemed to have dissolved in the water. Most of her body seemed incredibly bloated. Her eyes were a sickly yellow, but I could tell they had once been a piercing blue. But that wasn't what threw me, what threw me was the black substance pushing into her body like tree roots. Whatever it was had clearly overtaken every part of her body, working its way into her like a parasite. It was when I saw the unidentifiable insects with wings emerge from her skin that I knew I couldn’t take it anymore. So I slammed the bathroom door and ran to the sink to let loose my lunch. I tried to turn on the sink, but I stood in disbelief as no water came. 

“What the fuck is this place?” I asked my reflection in the kitchen sink faucet. 

“No one is answering my radio. Try yours.” Carter said, panic rising in his voice. That was yet another first for the evening. I took out my radio and called out the codes for a dead body and that we needed backup. But all we heard was radio static. We tried a few more times with the same result before I pulled out my cell and simply called 911. 

“911, what’s your emergency?” A female voice came over the speaker. I was relieved, we were finally going to get some help. 

“This is Officer Wyatt and Officer Halpert. We need backup at Paramount Apartments immediately. There is a dead body on the scene.” The line was silent for a good few seconds before the woman spoke again. 

“I'm sorry, can you not handle this Officer Wyatt?” The woman spoke in a blunt and mocking tone. I could have sworn I misheard her, so I turned up my volume and put her on speaker. 

“Excuse me? Could you repeat that?” I asked. 

“You're going to be a great story for mommy on the evening news, aren't you Oliver?” The voice was sickly sweet, like an abusive teacher trying to shame a crying child into stop crying. But with a hint of malice that I swear I have never heard in another human voice, and with a gleeful giggle that made my skin crawl. 

What came from the phone next can only be described as the sound of thousands of insects buzzing. A hive of vermin with far too many wings. It got to the point where Carter and I fell to the ground clutching our ears in pain. The sound was piercing and became deafening, like microphone feedback in a high school gym. It was far too loud a sound to be made by my phone. But as soon as the buzzing came, it went. We both sat up staring at the phone in disbelief. The call was still going and I jumped to hang up, managing to do so before the voice spoke again.  I checked my phone, desperate to call anyone that might be able to help us, but my touchscreen seemed unresponsive. It started to call 911 once more before Carter took it out of my hand and smashed it against the wall. He pulled me up and forced me to look him in the eye. 

“Oliver, listen. No one is coming. We are on our own here. We will deal with her later–what the hell!” He pointed towards the bathroom. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The mold was spreading from underneath the bathroom into the living room and toward the two of us. Creeping across the floor like vines in the jungle, while the buzz of hundreds of thousands of bugs roared behind the door. 

The two of us ran out of the room and down the hallway towards the way we thought the elevator was. As we ran, it felt like the building was decaying around us. The black substance seemed to bubble out of the floor like magma from a volcano, making the green carpet spongy and soggy, pushing itself out as if it was always just underneath the surface. The walls seemed to be growing thick, black tendrils that desperately reached out to us. But when we reached the end of the hallway, we found nothing but a cement wall. Carter and I stood in disbelief. I knew we came from this direction, but the wall stood there as plain as day.

“This is the direction that guy brought us, right?!” Carter asked as he touched the wall, which twitched at his touch. He pulled back quickly and shook it as if he had touched something putrid.

“I know it is.” I turned and looked in disbelief as I saw the black substance was easily cornering us like an apex predator, covering every surface of the hallway, and making sure there was no surface we could touch. But it was when I saw the rotting feminine figure exit the apartment, walking through the doorway and turning towards us like a marionette on a string, that I finally let myself scream. The only thing I could think to do was start knocking on all the other apartments. The doors that weren't covered with the moldy substance anyway.

Surely, someone must actually live here. I tried every door I could, but my knocking only caused the doors to twitch with seeming delight. Carter apparently got tired of my knocking and proceeded to kick one of the doors down. To our surprise, it seemed to be in the same condition as the other apartment, except this one had people in it. A small elderly couple was sitting on the couch when we entered the room. The old man quickly got up to meet us.

“Is there some kind of problem, officers?” he said in a concerned tone. 

“Is there a fire escape?” Carter asked, with a kind of panic I didn't think I would ever hear in his voice.

The old woman pointed towards the window while standing, “There is one over here. Why? Is there an emergency we should know about?” She asked in a concerned yet sweet tone. Carter and I looked at each other before I ran back to the hallway to check the mold. I was horrified to see the mold had completely consumed everything in the hallway. I turned my head violently to the left, only to come face-to-face with the decomposing woman from the bathtub. However, she wasn't really looking at me, her eyes were still very, very dead. They seemed to gaze in opposite directions, neither of which were at me. It was then that I saw one of them clearly for the first time. 

One of the woman's eyes twitched, before popping out entirely. The other eye quickly followed the first eye, as if she was a form of a hive. It looked like a moth and a spider had a baby. A malformed, twitchy thing that eyed me down with seemingly hundreds of eyes. But those eyes– I don’t know how I know, but I know there was intelligence behind those eyes. The intelligence of a being who had just caught its prey, like it had caught so many others. You know how you can tell when something is smiling with its eyes? This thing was smiling at me. Then, another came from her skin, like one of those exotic toads giving birth–and another, and another. I don’t know how I know, but they were all smiling at me. Then, I heard them. I heard them speak in the voice of…my mom, in a place in my mind that was just behind my eyes, “Officer Oliver Wyatt, why not doctor? Or lawyer” I ran back inside the apartment and closed the door behind me. I hadn't realized it, but I was crying. Crying like a little boy whose mom didn’t like his Mother's Day present. Then I realized, I heard that in my mothers voice. Why had I heard that in my mothers voice? I had never heard her say those words before, but at that moment, I could have sworn she had. Something she had said to my father while I was just out of earshot 

“Just stay in your room and don’t leave. Officer Wyatt and I will go and get help.” I looked over to see Carter struggling to get the window open–I ran to join him, and as I did, I lost track of the old couple. Carter and I pulled at the window for a bit, but even though it was clearly unlocked, it refused to move. 

“Perhaps you too will stay for a cup of coffee and some cake?” I turned to politely decline, but when I saw the old couple, I screamed. They had seemingly opened the door and let in the mold. The decaying woman just stood in the hall, as more of those bugs escaped her torso and seemingly any orifice they could. The old woman had thick black tendrils coming from her mouth and her eyes. The tendrils connected to the tray of coffee and cake which seemed to turn into pulsating masses before my eyes. The old man similarly had black tendrils going from his mouth and eyes to completely covering his body. I went back to pulling at the window while Carter pulled his gun on the old couple as they approached us.

“Get back!!” He ordered. Apparently, they didn't listen as he let out four shots. I turned back to see the old couple convulsing on the floor in what looked like pain. However, the writhing on the floor stopped when the couple’s abdomen’s began to expand, blowing up like balloons.

 They both began to laugh and choke in unison. It was then we saw it–the couple's abdomen began to break open, revealing thousands of those insects. Each one fighting to escape its host and adding on to the immense amount of insects growing from the decaying woman. The size was one thing, but the feeling of a crowd grinning at me left me frozen as if on a stage. Facing millions, if not billions, of grinning eyes. 

 “GET THAT WINDOW OPEN NOW!”  Carter screamed, breaking me from my trance. I picked up a chair and threw it at the window. It shattered immediately, and I climbed through. I turned back to help Carter get through, but when I did, I saw the insects had reached him. They swarmed him and seemed to fight their way into every orifice they could manage to fit their bodies into. I couldn't bear to watch whatever happened next as I ran down the rusty fire escape at top speed hearing his choking cries floors above me. I was so happy to see my squad car exactly where we had parked it. I jumped in and raced back to the station. 

I immediately told them an edited version of what happened so I wouldn't look as crazy as I felt. Then, a group of other officers and I went back to the address. But this time, it was gone. Not a vacant lot mind you, but a service center within McDonald's and a Starbucks. Turns out there never was a call from that address. At least not one that was recorded or one that anyone could remember. There was no sign of Paramount Apartments and no sign of Carter. To be honest, I can't even remember what Matt looked like. Not beyond the Oakley sunglasses and the pink polo. I wasn't able to give them an eye color, hair color, or anything besides the fact that he was a man in his mid-40s. And the old couple, I can't remember a single thing about what they looked like, but I can remember everything about how they died. I didn't know what to tell Carter's wife and kids. Hell, I didn't know what to tell anyone. Internal affairs had a field day with this, and after all of the psychological exams and interviews, I was canned. No one wanted to be the next Carter after that anyway. 

So, now it is up to me to find a new lifelong dream. But as cruel as it might sound I was happy trying to forget my time as an officer and be done with it. I was happy trying to forget about Carter. So why am I writing this? Because despite being done with whatever that was, I don’t think it’s done with me. I am writing this because a few hours ago, I got a knock on the door. When I went to check, I found a brochure lying on the ground. I picked it up only to see it was a brochure for Paramount Apartments. 

“Easy living” It said in big balloon lettering on the front page, along with a picture of the pristine apartment I had seen that day. Inside that apartment, waving toward me and wearing the biggest cartoon smile I’ve ever seen, was Carter, with thick black tendrils visible on his teeth and a dead puppet-like look in his eyes.

ive been bugging my family to watch coraline with me for weeks now and today we watched it, so we had just ate lunch and were gonna watch coraline and its about 7pm. my aunt makes coffee for her, my grandma, and dad, and my sister woke up 1pm today so she wasnt missing any sleep. (i woke up at 7:30am) and fifteen minutes into the movie im watching it and i look around to take a break and eveeyones DEAD ASLEEP. 

im hella confused because no one was missing sleep and they had JUST DRANK COFFEE? my grandma who doesn’t understand english but was watching for the visuals anyways WAS ASLEEP TOO. 

this freaked me out so much cus coraline in the movie sleeps and wakes up like 10 times and the concept is kinda like she thinks its a dream and whatnot. i ask them if the movie is boring and if they wanna change it, they say the visuals are so nice but the movie is “relaxing” (????) and they dont wanna change the movie. 

my grandma and aunt even got up a couple of times to go cut up some fruit and make a couple sandwiches for us to eat..we eat while watching but as soon as everyones done THEY DROP DEAD ASLEEP AGAIN? my aunt was trying so hard to stay up cus i could see her stopping herself since i bugged her the most to watch the movie for me so she was basically staying up for me.

but if the movie isnt bad/boring, and everyone was wide awake before it, no one was tired, WHY DID THEY ALL SLEEP? I WAS SO SCARED LIKE IS THIS AN EFFECT OF THE MOVIE OR WHAT?

i genuinely need answers are there like frequencies in the music that puts people to sleep? is there some psychology in the art? i dont get it and i feel crazy 😵‍💫",0,1731962912.0,Coraline,9,0.3,False

The adventure will start with a crossword puzzle. When he completes the puzzle, he'll use the circled letters to unscramble the location where the first clue will be.

Then I have 4 (so far) clues/locations, each written as rhyming couplets. Each clue will lead to either a small gift or small activity and the next clue. Here they are: 

“As you begin this journey you might be thinking “oh my!”  
Perhaps at the first stop, you should acquire a chai?

“Though Luna didn’t like it, other would find it quite sweet.  
At this house full of toys, you’ll find something for your feet.”

“Do you remember where we first met?  
Who knew it would be the beginning of our lifelong project!”

“Making this treat is never a chore,  
Go to a place where pugs are part of the décor.”

My request: What else can I do? I want to mix it up and add more ""puzzle-like"" clues, but I don't quite know what to do. I'd like the whole adventure to be a few hours/half a day.

It always sat around 180-190 degrees even in nyc traffic. On my way home one day it kept climbing and refused to cool down and found that the overflow tank was full, and there was a 7lb radiator cap on. 

Since then I had the overflow dumped. I changed the thermostat and put on a 16lb radiator cap and checked the oil for any sign of coolant or gunk(nothing). 

I haven’t driven in months. I’m stressed out due to having to repark the car because of street sweeps and during that process the car is hitting 250 degrees in 5 mins. 

Thoughts? Maybe needs a new radiator. Possibly have a lot of leaves and roadside trash stuck in between the radiator.

She's replaced the pump already and descaled it, yet it's still giving her issues. When it's run, you can hear some consistent buzzing sound and some on/off louder buzzing sound while it's pressurizing then it smooths out as the coffee starts flowing out. Pressure does increase slightly past 0 but no where near the espresso range.

I'm a tinkerer and good at replacing small parts in appliances. I'm debating about the risk involved as a new machine is a premium, but if I could replace a part or two for under $200, I'm wondering if this is a good deal. Also, any questions I should ask or things I should check before buying?

He now started sending me voice messages where he is asking if we could meet up in person because it would be easier to talk about things regarding the move especially since ”we now have a problem deciding who’s gonna take what items”. Before this he sent me a message asking if he can keep a few of the things we bought together then I stopped the conversation because I noticed myself getting very triggered and angry for the way he was trying to talk about and discuss how we should ”split” things we got while together even if I bought some of the things he mentioned with my own money bwcause for example, that day he had paid for our rides to the store where I purchased the items so we should split them in half. I just told him politely ”I am not able to talk about that right now, can we discuss this later another time” and then he started asking me what happened and why did I get mad because this is normal when people split. I did not show him any signs of being mad just the fact that I said can we talk about this later made him think so. 

He said in one of the voice messages that we could meet in a public space so I would feel safe like a coffee shop or a library, and he added that since I fear him now it would make sense because he wouldn’t be able to attack me in public. He said since I am not willing to talk on the phone we should meet up and that would be the best option to discuss these things but talking on the phone would be fine for him too. He told me I can take some time to think about this because I told him I’ll think about it. 

He let me know that he got a place and would be signing papers and would be leaving by the first of the month of December. It is 18th November today. I asked him if it is okay for him to tell me if his new location would be close to me and he asked me why I would want to know. I told him I want to know if there is a risk or chance of us seeing eachother. He said he doesn’t think we will but avoided giving a straight answer. He told me he would be avoiding spaces too that I attend whenever possible since we share some of the same friends. I told him there’s no need for that and he sent me a voice message where he said that since I am scared of meeting him or being in the same place as him even if it was in public, why wouldn’t he do that and what is the point of seeing eachother ever again if I keep wanting to know where he is moving, basically implying that I wanted to know the answer to that question because I fear him so much now that I want to avoid seeing him completely. I told him I don’t mind staying friends that have minimal contact such as being in the same space with a friend group if there is an event for example. He asked me how do I think that would even be possible if I avoid him so much right now. I told him I have not yet responded to if I want to discuss things over meeting in person or not, and that I would need to have a few days to think about it. He then read the message and has not responded to me anymore. What do you think all of this means?",1,1731962172.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

2. Energy Drinks And Gaming - What Matters?
3. The Best Energy Drink For Gaming
4. Conclusion

If you are reading this article, you are interested in competitive gaming and focused on improving your performance.  This article will highlight the importance of adding a high quality, powdered gaming energy drink supplement to your training.  The goal is to give you every edge possible over your competition.



# WHY YOU NEED A GAMING SUPPLEMENT

It’s 2021.  It’s time to start thinking of eSports in the same way we think of traditional sports.  The money, fame, prestige, clout, and life-changing opportunities already exist in competitive gaming at the highest level.  The competition to reach the pinnacle of any game is more intense than ever before.  Those who will succeed in eSports moving forward will know this one truth; talent will only get you so far.  To play like a champion, you have to train like a champion.

It’s widely known that traditional athletes performing at the highest level push themselves to the limit in their training so they can shine when it comes time to compete.  To fuel their performance, athletes turn to supplements to build and maintain their superhuman bodies.

Esports athletes have an advantage over traditional athletes in that they don’t have to break down and rebuild their bodies time and time again to improve performance.  Instead, a competitive gamer’s most important asset is their mind.  

Reaction time, complex problem solving, alertness, energy, focus, mood, memory, motivation.  These are all things a competitive eSports athlete needs to improve, manage, and balance in order to compete at their full potential.

A high quality gaming drink supplement is designed to support optimal brain performance in each of these categories so competitive gamers can train and perform at their greatest potential.  

**In this, powdered gaming drinks are king.**

Powdered gaming drinks are fundamentally more effective at increasing your energy, focus, endurance, and reaction speed because **more ingredients can be packed into each serving**.  Energy drink powders don’t come in liquid form so they can deliver greater amounts of active ingredients at more appropriate gram weights to induce more effective reactions in your body.

**These factors add up to energy drink powders being the best option for gaming drink consumption.**



# ENERGY DRINKS AND GAMING - WHAT MATTERS?

When selecting an energy drink powder for gaming, it’s important to look at these 6 key factors.  

* **Caffeine** **-** Ideal caffeine per serving for a gaming drink will be 150-200mg per serving.
* **Total Formula Gram Weight -** This is one of the most important factors when determining if a drink will actually work.  Not all drinks are created equal.  A good gaming drink will have 3 grams or more of active ingredients per serving to achieve the desired energy, focus, and endurance effects.
* **Individual Ingredient Gram Weight -** It goes without saying, but for an ingredient to work in your body, there has to be enough of that ingredient in the supplement.  Many low quality gaming drinks will put small doses of ingredients in their formula (20%, 10%, even 1% of recommended values) just so they can list the ingredient on their nutrition panels to trick consumers.  Look for formulas will robust gram weights at properly-dosed levels.
* **Cost Per Serving** **-** A typical gaming drink will have a cost of about $1-$1.50 per serving.
* **Mixability -** How well does your drink mix?  Just because it starts out as a powder doesn’t mean it should taste chalky and gross.  High quality gaming energy drink powders will mix perfectly and stay mixed.
* **Taste -** You want to drink something that tastes great.  No nasty aftertaste or vitamin flavoring.  This one is subjective but it’s obvious when a brand is doing well.



# BEST ENERGY DRINK FOR GAMING

Designed with performance in mind, [**Rogue Gaming Drinks**](https://rogueenergy.com/) has set the gold standard for quality, mixability, and taste in the gaming drink category.  Rogue is the only gaming drink company on the planet with [**4 unique product lines**](https://rogueenergy.com/collections/tubs) designed for different scenarios in your gaming training.

* ROGUE ENERGY - The ENERGY product line is the flagship product in the lineup.  Energy was designed as a direct replacement for sugar filled, ineffective canned energy drinks.  The old school canned stuff is essentially caffeine water with trace amounts of b vitamins.  Incredibly ineffective.  Rogue Energy has 3.5 grams of active ingredients, 175mg caffeine, is loaded with vitamins, has zero sugar, only 5 calories, and mixes and tastes amazing.  With 200mg of L-Theanine (the active ingredient in green tea), the energy curve is smooth and consistent with no aggressive spike and no crash.  Additionally, there are over 1.5 grams of active focus ingredients alone that help you mentally lock in and perform complex mental tasks at the highest level.  
*  
* ROGUE HYDRATION - The Hydration product line is Rogue’s sugar-free, caffeine-free, stimulant-free, thirst-quenching product.  This product is essentially an improved version of Gatorade with additional focus ingredients for added mental performance.  With no caffeine and no sugar, you can enjoy Rogue Hydration anytime of day.  Drink it late at night during extra long gaming sessions when stimulants would jeopardize sleep.  Take it during and after intense physical activity to replenish the body’s essential electrolytes.
*  
* **ROGUE EXTREME -** The Extreme product line is designed for moments of extreme mental and physical exertion.  With a high-stimulant, sugar-free formula that includes BCAAs for recovery, Rogue Extreme is ideal for intense bursts of both mental and physical activity.  When you have to give it all for a short period of time, Rogue Extreme is the G.O.A.T.
* **ROGUE SHAKE -** The Shake product line is the newest product in the Rogue lineup.  Nothing is more difficult than making healthy diet choices while gaming when all you want to do is dig into a pint of ice cream, crack open a sleeve of Oreos, or drown your worries in a gallon of sugary Starbucks coffee.  The Rogue Shake product line offers a first-of-its-kind, sugar-free energy milkshake so you can “treat yourself” while actually making a healthy choice during your gaming sessions.  The formula includes a moderate amount of caffeine at 130mg, vitamins, a robust focus complex, and of course, zero sugar.  When you are feeling weak and don’t want to cheat on your diet worse than hackers in Warzone, turn to Rogue Shake.

 

# CONCLUSION

The future of eSports and competitive gaming is incredibly bright.  Anyone interested in competing at the highest levels of any game needs to begin to take all aspects of their training as seriously as possible; including their diet and the supplements they take to increase performance.  Scientifically designed energy drink powders for gaming are far and away the best option for optimizing gaming potential on a supplement level.  Scope out [**Rogue Energy**](https://rogueenergy.com/) and the other Rogue products to elevate your competitive gaming potential.  If you are interested in joining our [**gaming sponsorship program**](https://rogueenergy.com/pages/sponsorship), you can join with no application required.  We were rated one of the [**best gaming sponsorships**](https://www.gamingsponsorships.com/top-rated) by gamingsponsorships.com.

A person is driving a car. He’s very tired and drinks coffee and takes pills to stay awake. He enters a city, but all the people there look like plastic dolls or matryoshka-like figures. They don’t move or do anything. He loses it and starts smashing some of them with a bat.

1guer5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeMyselfWeOurself/comments/1guer5t/a_journey_through_creativity_the_art_wall_at/,A Journey Through Creativity: The Art Wall at Barnes & Noble 🎨✨,"Away in the cozy corners of **Barnes & Noble**, this wall of art immediately caught my attention. It wasn’t just the vibrant colors or the intricate strokes—it was the emotions that seemed to leap out of each piece. This collection, so diverse in its style and tone, felt like a visual diary of thoughts, emotions, and stories.

Each painting seemed to tell its own tale:

* A **woman with striking blue hair**, her expression a mix of serenity and mystery, as if guarding untold secrets.
* The vibrant **yellow flower**, standing tall in a glass jar, felt like a symbol of hope amidst chaos.
* The **umbrella lady in pink**, delicate and whimsical, yet grounded in her own universe.
* A burst of **orange and black skies**, portraying either destruction or renewal—it’s left to interpretation.

It’s fascinating how art has the ability to evoke such different emotions from one person to another. Standing here, I felt a sense of connection to the artists, as though I was peeking into fragments of their world. These pieces, displayed together, told a collective story of creativity, struggle, and beauty.

Art like this reminds us that **expression has no boundaries**. Whether it’s through a brush, a camera, or a keyboard, there’s something magical about taking thoughts and turning them into something tangible. These paintings were not just decorations—they were **conversations waiting to happen**, invitations to stop and think, to feel, and to connect.

If you ever find yourself wandering through Barnes & Noble, don’t just grab a coffee or a book. Look around for the art—there’s always a story waiting for you. 🌟🎨

1gueqwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/JumpChain/comments/1gueqwe/unlimited_beverage_works_perk_from_generic_thirst/,Unlimited Beverage Works perk from Generic Thirst.,"So how would you use Generic Thirst Jump's Unlimited Beverage Works perk? It seems pretty fun. You can use Avatar: The Last Airbender style bending of the drink you selected. I can see it being interesting to do patterns and make waves with something like Fanta Grape or Sprite.

I'm not sure how the Favorite Beverage item price system works, I believe it would grant you the ability to summon any standard drink type, at will, and with the ability to choose a different type each time you summon it, if you pay 100 choice points for the item, any drink of the background you selected if you only paid 50CP, and only one drink of the correct background if you don't pay for the item and take the free version. If it's only for summoning one specific drink of the allowed types for the price tier, I don't think I'll be using the more expensive versions of the item and simply settle for like some kind of soda pop like Fanta Grape. If you gain access to all types for the price tier, I'll get the 100CP version for sure, as being able to summon any real world drink type to my side, drinking different kinds of soda depending on what I feel like, would be nice.

Unlimited Beverage Works (600cp)
Don’t worry, despite the name of this perk, this has nothing to do with Nasu. I just liked the name. Anyway, what this actually does is it makes you a Bender, as in Avatar the Last Airbender style of bending, of whatever substance or substances you have available from the Favorite Beverage item below. You will now be able to summon this liquid in much larger quantities, enough to make effective use of this power in combat.
Taking this perk requires you to take the Libation Wars drawback.

Favorite Beverage (Free for All Origins or 50cp or 100cp)
You have an unlimited supply of your favorite drink, made exactly how you like it, and you can summon a glass/cup/shot/whatever of it at any time. For 50cp, this can be any beverage of a general type, such as any soda, any type of coffee or any cocktail. For 100cp, this can be any beverage at all, though beverages that normally provide a supernatural effect, such as healing potions or a god’s ichor, will not provide those benefits, though they will have all the taste of the authentic drink.",5,1731961963.0,JumpChain,0,1.0,False
1gueqhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/RogueEnergy/comments/1gueqhz/benefits_of_ltheanine_caffeine_pairing/,Benefits of L-Theanine & Caffeine Pairing,"L-theanine and caffeine are two substances that are often consumed together. L-theanine is an amino acid found in green tea leaves, and caffeine is a naturally occurring stimulant found in coffee beans, tea leaves, and other sources. When consumed together, these two substances have been shown to have a number of potential benefits.

In this blog post, we will explore the benefits of l-theanine when paired with caffeine.

# Improved Focus and Concentration

One of the most well-known benefits of caffeine is its ability to improve focus and concentration. However, some people experience negative side effects of caffeine, such as jitters or anxiety. This is where l-theanine can come in. Studies have shown that l-theanine can help to reduce the negative effects of caffeine while still maintaining its positive effects on focus and concentration. L-theanine is thought to do this by promoting a state of relaxation without causing drowsiness.  Products like [**Rogue Energy**](https://rogueenergy.com/collections/all-flavors) pair 200mg of l-theanine with 175mg of caffeine for a smooth, non-jittery energy and focus boost.

# Reduced Anxiety

As mentioned, some people may experience anxiety or jitters when consuming caffeine. L-theanine has been shown to have a calming effect, which may help to counteract these negative effects. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry found that l-theanine reduced anxiety symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.

# Improved Sleep Quality

While caffeine can improve focus and energy levels, it can also interfere with sleep. L-theanine has been shown to have a relaxing effect and may improve sleep quality when consumed before bed. In a study published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, participants who consumed a combination of l-theanine and caffeine before bed had improved sleep quality compared to those who consumed a placebo.

# Reduced Blood Pressure

Both caffeine and l-theanine have been shown to have a positive effect on blood pressure. However, when consumed together, they may have an even greater effect. A study published in the journal Biological Psychology found that a combination of caffeine and l-theanine reduced blood pressure.",1,1731961936.0,RogueEnergy,0,1.0,False
1gueq4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1gueq4p/for_those_who_went_from_friends_to_more/,For Those Who Went From Friends to More...,"I'm curious to hear from those who have formed romantic relationships with friends of the opposite sex after having been friends for awhile. What did your story look like? Had you been friends for a long time first? Was there always a 'crush' there? How was the conversation raised by one or the other? Was it immediately reciprocated by the other or thought about first? Was it weird at first?

Asking mostly because I have a friend I feel I've always had a connection with - never a rip your clothes off chemistry, but definitely a chemistry/connection/closeness. It feels calm, and nice. I've always assumed I am not his type and so I consider myself friend-zoned really and act as such. But he  regularly reaches out to do things - coffee, Ikea day trips, to see how I am, sends me pictures from his trips, get my opinion on xyz, etc. To me that doesn't mean much though so I don't take it as anything more than friendship. Anyways, overtime I find myself in this spot of having a small crush on him, or just being curious I guess - but also feeling like I would/should already know if it was going to become more.  We get along super well, have a lot in common, similar ages, and mostly he is just a really kind, thoughtful and together human being. But, he is also hard to read is the type that doesn't easily express emotion.  He has not really dated anyone in the two years I've known him but know he has had girlfriends in the past. I really do assume if he was interested he would have mentioned or asked me out more on a date versus coffees etc., right? And really, it's fine if we just stay friends, I am not emotionally caught up or anything, mostly just curious if we could have something even better than what we have now. 

Anyways, all that to say, I'm curious to hear how that has worked for anyone who has successfully turned a friendship into more. If nothing else, these stories are always joyful ones to hear. ",3,1731961909.0,datingoverforty,12,0.81,False

While I may not be the best worker, the hours were sufficient for me to keep up with my insurance. I genuinely enjoyed my time there, but this week I didn't receive any hours. I'm quite serious about the importance of my work hours; after all, no one will care about my career more than I do. 

So, I sent a respectful text to my manager to understand why I wasn't scheduled. She explained that there weren't enough hours to go around and suggested that I should look for another job if I wanted more hours. It feels like she is avoiding confrontation by implying that my work performance is lackluster instead of addressing it directly with me.

Now I'm unsure how to respond. I don't know if I've lost my job or if there's still a chance for more work, and I'm worried that if I say the wrong thing, she might get upset. I could really use some help with how to approach this situation.",0,1731961788.0,jobs,3,0.33,False

Someone recommended coffee grounds on my previous strawberry post to improve the green in my leaves, so I used that alongside a 5-5-5 fertilizer. Hard to know which did the trick, but I’m guessing both helped a lot.

I’m just amazed at the science of it, as someone who never used fertilizer before and was too impatient to try anything new. I also thought I was the one who just didn’t know how to care for plants and was responsible for having them die or stunt in growth. I even tried a soil acidifier and noticed no improvement until I added nutrients to the soil. Thank you to the gardening community! I’ve now reached a point where I will be having my first harvest, and my other plants are growing like crazy!

Also, I switched to using ProMix soil from HomeDepot. I was always using Dr. Earth, but my plants would turn light green with a purple/red hue and suddenly stop growing before their true leaves grew up. I’m also noticing this soil allows for better water retention and I’m having good luck with slow growing herbs like Rosemary. Any that did grow with the previous soil would die early or grew slowly and were poorly nourished, like my strawberry. This has been my observation for anyone else who’s a beginner gardener and struggling and doesn’t know what to fix: Check your soil first or try new soils.

 While checking out this particular sport and talking to the trainers, I pass by this handsome guy and we exchange looks. 

He approaches me about the sport, curious about how I wanted to get back into, etc. 

He was very sweet and into me, me too of course. 

At one point, though, I had to hurry off because I was going to miss my last bus. But I didn’t get his number, nor leave mine. 

Last week I got with a friend again to the gym, and we meet again. He’s visibly nervous and excited, and we get talking again. 

He asks me if I’m joining the gym etc and I say no. Unfortunately, the times and days don’t work for me. 

After talking some more, he says “we should grab a coffee”, to which I responded enthusiastically. I left my number on his phone and saved it. 

Well, ladies and gents, it’s been a week now and he never wrote to me. 

I’m not going to lie, it does upset me a little. 

It’s hard to be dating lately and finding someone decent. This doesn’t help much.

1guej0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1guej0e/trip_report_a_marvelous_trip_to_tokyo_113_1113/,Trip Report - A Marvelous Trip to Tokyo (11/3 - 11/13),"This was my first time in Japan and my first international trip. I want to thank the people in this sub for giving me advice and tips on luggage, wifi access, and neighborhoods to visit. This was my original [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1f3vn7c/tokyo_itinerary_9_days_feedback_needed_for_first/) regarding itinerary help.

**About me:** I am an Asian American from the United States in my early thirties. I studied basic travel phrases for a couple months prior to my trip, so I had some words down for ordering food, shopping, and small talk. I went with a group of three other friends (two of them went to Japan last year) but we stayed in separate locations in Tokyo. I was exploring solo around 70 percent of the time.

**Day One (Monday) - Landed at Haneda**

Flew Japan Airlines and the experience and food were excellent. Had two meals and snacks so I felt satisfied. I barely slept during the nearly 12 hour flight with only a brief nap. I also forgot my earbuds at home so I was extremely bored and passed the time talking to my friend.

The first part of the trip was rocky. We landed in Haneda at the same time as several other flights. Going through immigration was horrific. It took us nearly an hour and 45 minutes to clear the gates where the passport checkers were. The lines were long and winding and the ventilation was poor with barely any air conditioning coming in. This was easily the worst part of the trip.

We went to currency exchange, picked up our Welcome Suica cards, and I picked up my pocket wifi at the ninja wifi counter (obtained through Japan Wireless) since my phone does not support esim. We took our respective trains to our lodging and luckily did not get lost.

I stayed at **Hotel Sardonyx Ueno** which was a couple blocks from Okachimachi Station. The hotel was excellent but the rooms are small. The hotel has coin laundry which costs 600 yen for a 2 hour wash and dry cycle. The staff were nice and I got checked in quickly. I checked in around 10:15 PM. I was unsure of what to eat so in desperation, I went to the local McDonald's (lol) and picked up some fries and a burger.

**Day Two (Tuesday) - Ueno Park - Ameyoko Shopping District - brief detour to Asakusa**

I spent the first day exploring the ""home base"" of Ueno. I was out and about around 7:45 AM. I went to **Komeda's Coffee** for a cup of joe and ordered a tonkatsu sandwich which came with toast and egg. It was a great way to kick off the trip with some caffeine and a bite.

I explored Ueno Park which was a short walk away. The park was peaceful and quiet as I passed by the Saigō Takamori statue. I walked by some shrines and Takenodai Square. The park was beautiful and walkable. It was clean and the trees and foliage were well kept. Unfortunately, the Tokyo National Museum was closed due to Culture Day so I elected to go back to Ameyoko Shopping District by taking the train at Ueno Station.

I went and explored Ameyoko Shopping District. There are loads of stalls and eateries including markets, tea shops, izakayas, ramen shops, clothing stores, and arcades.

The highlight of the night was a haircut appointment I had booked in October for **Hiro Ginza Ueno.** It was 10,120 yen for a 90 minute haircut, shave, and head spa. It was very relaxing and I was happy to start my trip with a fresh cut. Although there was a significant language barrier, I was extremely satisfied with the haircut and service.

I did a very quick trip to Asakusa to wrap up the evening since my friend wanted to grab some beers. The bar was small but lively. Beer is always good!

**Day Three (Wed) - Asakusa - Sumida Park - Tobu Railway Musuem - Tokyo Skytree**

I walked along the big street Inaricho station is located on to Asakusa. It took about 35-40 minutes to reach the **Asakusa Culture Tourist Information Center.** I grabbed coffee along the way. **Kaminarimon, Nakamise Dori, and Senso-ji** along with the surrounding areas were beautiful but packed full of people. This was around 10-10:30 AM.

After visiting the temples, I went inside Don Quixote Asakusa and the surrounding areas. The store was full of items - luggage, cosmetics, snacks, electronics, clothes, etc. It was a bit overwhelming though.

Sumida Park was next. It was very quiet with a few bikers, and dog walkers. It was a bit drizzly and gloomy but I still had fun getting my steps in along the river.

Tobu Museum is a small but enjoyable railway museum. Thanks to u/dougwray for suggesting! There were no crowds at all so I had a leisurely stroll inside. The historical train carriages were fascinating and you can walk and sit inside most of them.

Tokyo Skytree was phenomenal. I reunited with my friends here and bought combo tickets for the Tembo Deck and Galleria. Imho it was well worth it. I got to the ticketing booth at 3:55 PM and was able to choose the 4:00 PM entry time. The views left me speechless and we stayed for pictures as it transitioned into nighttime with all the glittering lights.

**Day Four (Thursday) - Akihabara - Tokyo Dome - Ichigaya**

Walked from the hotel to **Cafe Lapin** at around 9 AM. The cheese toast and coffee were delicious! It wasn't your run of the mill grilled cheese sandwich. The cheese was soft and gooey but had substance. The coffee was rich and bold.

Afterwards I walked to Akihabara which took around 18-25 minutes. It was around 10 AM and most stores were still closed so I decided to walk to Higashi-Nihombashi to visit the **Sakazen Large Size Specialty Store.** This is a great store if you're a bigger guy like me who wears XXL-XXXL clothing. The selection was decent and I was able to pick up a button down. Took the train back to Akihabara to meet with friends and explored the model kit shops like Tamtam, Warhammer Cafe, and Popondetta Akihabara (thank you u/dougwray again!).

Dropped off my purchases at the hotel and took the train to Tokyo Dome. I am a huge baseball fan so this was a must see. The NPB season had ended in October but the shops, mall, spa, and amusement park were still open. **Tokyo Dome City** is massive.

Lastly, I ended the night with a head spa appointment I booked at **Mr. Head** by Ichigaya Station. It was 90 minutes of blissful massage for 11,200 yen.

**Day Five (Friday) - Ginza**

Started the morning at 8:35 AM at **Glitch Coffee** in Ginza. The shop opens at 9 AM so I went around the block for 15 minutes before coming back. Big mistake. There was already a small line and there were about 12 people ahead of me. I finally entered at around 9:35 AM. I paid 2000 yen for a coffee (roughly $15) per their recommendation. It was easy to drink and smelled wonderful like fruit but I didn't think it was worth 2000 yen lol. Definitely recommend coming here during opening. There was a line for at least 30-40 yards when I exited the shop.

Walked around **Tsukiji Outer Market** around 10:15 AM. The market was packed full of people and I didn't feel like trying some of the yummy snacks since the lines were long. Headed back to Ginza and explored shops like Montbell, Porter, etc. I headed to **Tokyo Station** afterwards for lunch at **Tokyo Ramen Street.** I got lost trying to leave Tokyo Station but eventually got to **Marunouchi Square** which was gorgeous. I am a big fan of the old-school looking train station! The plaza is huge and spacious - perfect for photos. I turned around and entered the **Kokyo Gaien National Garden.** This place was massive but I wasn't sure how much I could explore. The trees and grass were well kept and the views through the garden to the city were superb. I walked through the garden paths and exited back to Ginza.

I explored more of Ginza including the Uniqlo Flagship Store but the narrow aisles and huge crowds weren't as fun. Unfortunately, my feet were in significant pain that day and I had to cut my evening short by coming back to Ueno.

**Day Six (Saturday) - Ueno**

This was a rest/laundry day owing to my poor feet. I bought some teas and matcha for my family in Ameyoko early in the morning at 10 am when the shops opened up. I went back to the **Tokyo National Musuem** since it was closed on Tuesday. The pieces were excellent but imo somewhat limited. There were swords, pottery, wall dividers, artwork, sculptures, and more. Note: I only got the regular ticket but it seems like the premium ticket would be the better investment for more access.

Had **Magurobito** in Ueno for an early sushi dinner. I took advantage of there being no line and sat at the counter. The chef makes sushi according to your selection off a menu. The fish and seafood were delicious and it was relatively affordable (15 pieces for around $31 USD). In retrospect, I should have eaten more sushi on the trip but my body was constantly craving ramen. Went back to the hotel to start the laundry cycle and went back out to Ameyoko for some more food.

**Day Seven (Sunday) - Return to Ginza**

This was a shopping-focused day. I had to make up some of the time lost on Day Five. I started off the day at the **Tamiya Plamodel Factory**. The facility was clean, bright, and family-friendly. I think Tamtam or Yodobashi Camera have a bigger selection of model kits, but the packaging at Tamiya Plamodel Factory seem cleaner and newer.

Did some more exploring in Ginza. Went into various malls like **Ginza Six** which was chalk full of boutique goods. Headed to **Pokemon Center DX** to pick up some plushies. The store was smaller than I expected. There are a lot of plushies for sale as well as accessories, trinkets, and trading cards. The Pokemon Cafe is also in the same floor but I did not go there.

Went back to Ueno to close out the evening and had a satisfying dinner at **Hakata Ramen Ichiban.** In addition to noodles and meat, the shop gives you a delicious plate of bean sprouts, cabbage, and mushrooms covered in gravy. One of the best meals I had in Tokyo!

**Day Eight (Monday) - Meiji Jingu - Harajuku - Shibuya**

Started the day off at a local cafe with some coffee and cheesecake. Rode the JR line to Yayogi Station. I stood behind the driver in the first car and watched the train move across the city. It's a marvelous view and fascinating to see how the train moves through the various stations. I walked through Meiji Jingu. It was an easy relaxing walk with the lush scenery around you. I also went into the **Meiji Jingu Inner Garden** where **Kiyomasa's Well** is located. It was 500 yen to enter but was well worth it. There was a short line at Kiyomasa's Well for people to touch the water. The paths in the Inner Garden were narrow but the location is secluded from the main Meiji Jingu area so it was not crowded at all. Other attractions include the South Pond, Iris Garden, and Teahouse.

Exited the park and went down **Takeshita Street**. While impressive, the street was narrow and too crowded for my liking. Had a quick bite at Marion Crepes. It was good but perhaps overhyped by my friends. Went into Harajuku/**Cat Street** to do some denim hunting and sightseeing. Managed to snag some jeans at Pure Blue Japan and Momotaro. I really enjoyed this neighborhood - the winding roads and intricate storefronts were a joy to experience. Ended up at Kiddy Land. Their basement floor is dedicated to Snoopy and Peanuts! Ended my trip at the **Shibuya Scramble**. It was a majestic sight with the lights and hordes of people crossing.

**Day Nine (Tuesday) - Shinjuku/Kabukicho**

Explored Shinjuku with my friends. Got lucky and managed to escape Shinjuku Station without much trouble. Explored the various Yodobashi Camera stores on the west side of the station. Ended up at the **Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building** for some free spectacular views of the city. It was less crowded than Tokyo Skytree and imo rivals the views. Traveled to Kabukicho in the late afternoon early evening and it was surprisingly empty. We went through **Kabukicho Tower** which was also devoid of people. We probably came here too early. Got a drink at **Golden Gai** and did some bar hopping on the eastern part of Shinjuku.

**Day Ten (Wed) - Fly home from Haneda**

Nothing noteworthy about this day but traveling back to Haneda from Ueno and getting through security took about 90 minutes total. I vastly overestimated the time needed to go through the airport due to my negative experience of arriving at Haneda the prior week. I ended up staying at the airport for nearly 5 hours and walked around. There is a special Pokemon vending machine at Terminal 3 that you can pick up some special Haneda-themed merchandise though.

**Missed Opportunities and Lessons Learned**

* My feet hurt much more than I anticipated. I have very flat feet which probably contributed to the pain. I averaged around 20k steps a day but was already in deep pain. I was wearing athletic shoes but may consider other options or an insert.
* Because of the above, I couldn't stay out as late as I wanted to and had to break some days apart. This means I'll probably schedule more vacation days in the future to cover everything
* I am not a big crowd person. Shibuya and parts of Ginza were simply too crowded and I felt overwhelmed.
* Did not have enough time to visit Odaiba and the Tokyo Metro Musuem! Need to also explore the western side of Shibuya and the eastern part of Shinjuku!

**Notes and Tips**  
**-----------------------**

**Staying at Ueno**

This is probably confirmation bias but I want to thank the people here for suggesting Ueno as a place to stay. It's probably my favorite area in Tokyo that I've explored. It has enough people and stuff going on that it feels lively and exciting but isn't as overwhelming as Shibuya and Ginza. There are a ton of shops and food choices at Ameyoko and it is well connected to train lines heading in each direction. After a couple days, it practically felt like your backyard.

**Learning Basic Japanese**

I found it extremely rewarding learning some basic Japanese phrases. Things like ""what do you recommend?"" or ""what is that?"" or ""what are your hobbies?"" goes a long way in making the trip more enjoyable! Personally, I like interacting with people and I think most are genuinely happy to see someone making an attempt to learn their language! Even a basic ""good morning"" or ""thank you"" is better than nothing.

**Pocket Wifi**

I rented my pocket wifi through Japan Wireless and picked it up at Haneda Airport. The wifi signal was satisfactory and generally reliable. I did have to restart the connection once or twice but it wasn't a big deal. It cost 11,530 yen to rent it for 10 days. It came with a battery pack and a charging cable. The wifi box had enough energy to last from morning to late evening but I recommend bringing a battery pack just in case. It comes with a prepaid envelope to package and mail the box once your trip is over. You can drop it off at a Japan Post mailbox at the airport before you go through security.

**Trains and Buses**

I found the public transportation system excellent. Trains were pretty fast, clean, punctual, and quiet. I was able to navigate the system without issue after two days. Here are my suggestions when taking the train:

1. Identify the train line you need to take - this can be done through Google maps. Look for the letter, color, or name of the train line. I find that looking for the big letter helps the most. You can find signs with the letters and train names throughout the station. For example, the Ginza line is a big fat ""G"" and the Tokyo Skytree Line is ""TS.""
2. Identify the platform - for example, if google maps says Ginza Line Platform 1, there should be posters or signs saying ""1"" or ""2"" or 3"" etc. littered throughout the station. The number corresponds with the platform.
3. Getting off the train - this is a little trickier but still relatively easy. Most trains will have a digital monitor on top of the doors that tell you in English and Japanese the names of the upcoming stations. If there are no monitors, I suggest listening to the name of the station when it is called or looking for the signs at the train barriers. Stations are also in sequential order EX: Ueno Station is ""G16"" and the preceding station is ""G17."" If you forgot the name of the station, listen for the station identification number.

I had a wonderful time in Tokyo and plan to go back to Japan again soon! Hope this all helps! Feel free to message here or dm me if you need assistance.",1,1731961419.0,JapanTravel,1,1.0,False
1gueher,https://i.redd.it/mk72x9b6yp1e1.jpeg,I need to upgrade from Kaged Pre-Workout Elite — recommendations?,"You guys are great with recommendations. I picked up Kaged Pre-Workout Elite about six months ago based upon recommendations here. It was great for pump, energy, endurance. But, lately, it has not been enough. My trainer has put me on a more challenging program that is undoubtedly yielding results in losing fat, gaining muscle, increasing strength. But it’s been challenging to get through workouts — from an energy and muscle endurance POV. 

I, now, no longer get the tingles and the pre only makes a minimal impact. 

I’ve already tried 1.5X the dose, but it hasn’t been enough. 

I’m not particularly caffeine sensitive and don’t consume a lot of caffeine outside of my pre (no coffee etc) so I definitely think I have the tolerance for higher stim. But like I said, also looking for greater endurance.

I’m well rested, well hydrated, all my labs from my doctor are normal, I’m getting my daily protein macros and although I restrict carbs due to LADA Type 1.5 diabetes, I do have some carbs before the workouts, too.

Note: I add 2g agmatine sulfate to my pre, per recommendations here.

1guehc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowDoseNaltrexone/comments/1guehc8/ldn_coffee/,LDN & Coffee,"I started LDN @ 1.5 mg. After 7 days with no side effects I went up to 3.0 mg and experienced extreme nausea and back pain. It felt like there were knives in mt stomach and my back was on fire,  I took three days off and started over again @ 1.5 mg.  It has been 13 days since I restarted. By day 11 I started noticing stomach and back pain.  The pain seemed to be getting worse each day, not as bad as @ 3 mg, bad enough that I was going to reset again and start at .5 mg if the pain continued today.

  
I drink 16 oz of coffee a day on average, one large cup sipped on from 8:00 AM until around 2:00/3:00 PM. I have drank twice this amount without issue, mostly on the weekends, always black, no sugar. Yesterday I woke up with stomach/back pain a little worse than the day before. I got busy and didn't drink coffee until 1:00 PM,  I thought the coffee might be making the pain worse. I could barely eat dinner. After taking 1 Pepcid and 4 TUMMS last night the pain subsided a bit. I woke up this morning without major stomach/back pain and held off on drinking coffee until 1:00. I have drank 4 oz in two hours and now have stomach and back pain.  I don't think tea gives me the same reaction, my it's the acidity of the coffee?

1guea7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/msnbc/comments/1guea7p/backbone_deficient_man_makes_a_spineless_choice/,Backbone Deficient Man Makes a Spineless Choice *shocked pikachu face*,"Let’s be real—anyone tuning into *Morning Joe* hoping for a bastion of backbone and moral consistency has long needed to adjust their expectations. This weekend, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, MSNBC’s resident chaos couple, tossed the final shreds of their integrity out the window, and took a field trip to Mar-a-Lago.

Let’s not pretend like this is shocking. The dynamic duo of performative outrage did what they do best: they traded their righteous indignation for a little cozying up to the man they once declared a threat to democracy. This wasn’t just a casual chat over bagels and coffee; this was a full-on face-to-face with the man who called Mika “crazy” and claimed he saw her “bleeding badly from a facelift.” I think that's called ""selective amnesia.""

To recap: Joe called Trump a dictator, a threat to democracy, and a whole horror show wrapped in spray tan. In turn, America's Whiny Dorito-Colored Demagogue said Joe left Congress because he killed someone. Normal, casual banter between “frenemies,” right? But now, Joe’s in front of the cameras, waving off the face-lift jab and comparing his little sit-down to “diplomatic work.” Don’t insult the concept of diplomacy, Joe. It’s not giving Kissinger—it’s giving desperation.

I, for one, am living for the hypocrisy Olympics we’re witnessing. Mika going from her “Know Your Value” hustle to bowing at the altar of an adjudicated rapist is a career plot twist so wild even Lifetime would reject it. Joe said they were “not here to defend or normalize Florida Man,” which would be more convincing if they weren’t literally doing both.

**So, here we are, watching a channel that prides itself on resisting the very ideologies represented by a Narcissistic Circus Peanut suddenly play nice, with only the thinnest veil of journalistic duty. You can’t just bait people with the “Democracy Is At Risk” message for years and then casually hop over to the guy’s estate to sip tea and call it reporting.**

**If MSNBC wants to be a beacon of journalistic integrity under an autocratic regime, they owe their viewers better. You can’t champion integrity and accountability while playing both sides when it suits you. We as audience members deserve more than performative waffling and selective memory; we deserve true, unwavering journalistic conviction. If the message is “Democracy is at risk,” then act like it—consistently, and without exceptions.**",14,1731960800.0,msnbc,0,0.82,False
