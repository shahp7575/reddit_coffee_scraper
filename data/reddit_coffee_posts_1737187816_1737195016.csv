Time to try something else,"Ive learnt that ive got niche taste. The best coffee ive ever had is Voodoo Comet from imperial teas.  Its thick, dark, like drinking a cigar and nothing ive ever had has come close.  But theyre out of stock and I want to try something different.

Ive always been disappointed by other roasters ive tried (Rave, Monmouth, i cant remember the others).  I dont like acidity or fruitiness. 

Im hoping theres a fan of Voodoo Comet here who can recommend other dark roasts.

Its kind of similar to monsoon malabar for those who havent tried it yet.",1,1737194760.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I am using mischief mini grinder, been doin good for the past 6mos, then it suddenly stopped grindin, but making humming noise.

I tried disassembling the top part and cleaning it, but still the same. Humming noiae, grinder not moving.

Any advice how to fix it? 

Though i have already bought starseeker E55, and its on its way. Still want to revive the mischief mini as a backup. Surprisingly, it grinds consistently for the price.

Today, while on a walk with my sister, we stopped by one of many street library hutches. We haven’t come across this one before (near Two Boys One Beagle and A Coffee Shop if anyone’s interested) which had a great selection and the books were in great condition — the custodian is clearly looking after their wares, and for that we thank you! We dropped off 3 and picked up 2!

Afterwards, we were sat with our coffees, watching the local cricket club, and a lady stopped by to joke with us that the cricket club canteen would be making good coin if it offered iced coffees and/or espresso martini’s for sale to the people in the park next to it. She was so jovial, and it was so nice to interact and have an unexpected laugh with someone from the neighbourhood.

Not long after, an elderly man (edit: probably
more older than elderly) saw my sister and myself tugging on the runners of a fig tree on an abandoned block, and offered to get us a shovel. He jogged off, came back with the shovel, then proceeded to help us split off some runners! What a delightful human!

I realise these aren’t monumental things, but it honestly made my day and reminded me of a community spirit I haven’t felt for quite some time. Go Frankston!",3,1737194516.0,melbourne,0,1.0,False

","I (25M) started a few weeks ago at 151KG (332lb), and I’m now at 141KG (310lb). I’m well aware there will be water weight in there as it’s not my first time trying to lose weight. 

I’ve stopped driving to work and instead walk to work, it’s about 3 miles each way and I roughly do about 12K steps a day walking to work. On the weekend I can hit 20K-35K steps a day easily. Walking has always been something I’ve enjoyed. The mental part of walking regularly is doing me a lot of good.

Tracking my calories has been super helpful too, as it’s become almost like a game to me now to try and keep my calories down and track what I’m eating.

I naturally don’t eat breakfast, so I’ve naturally gravitated to a OMAD and 2MAD fasting regime too.

I’ve completely cut out sugar and fizzy drinks where possible. I drink as much water as I can, and mix it up with some tea and coffee too. I’ve also grown quite fond of sugar free flavored water too. I’m a bit of a fussy eater but I’ve found my eating habits are getting a lot better recently.

Because I have cut out sugar for the most part, I’m not snacking at all really now as I have no need, I was eating stuff like chocolate, donuts, pastries etc all the time.

Fast food I’ve given up for the most part, and I’ve set a rule of not eating it at home, or have it delivered.  ",5,1737194418.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

Hi, I don’t really know where to go. I’m sorry if this post isn’t the best. I’m so anxious as I type this. I have PTSD as I recently moved out of my abusive and toxic home, I had to go no contact with my parents and I live with my partner and BIL. Things have been okay, I’ve been happy. But, recently my autistic BIL has been doing a lot of stuff. I have a ton of patience, I still do even during all of this but today was really hard. Things were small at first, he’d rant to me about stuff. I didn’t like he’d try ranting to me about my partner (like mean stuff sometimes? And then also just complaining about like random things) because that was uncomfortable but at the time, I didn’t know much about autism and I was raised not being allowed to set boundaries. I learned I needed to be direct and clear so I began preparing myself to be. I’ve been sick, but a couple days ago he asked me to make him an omelet. I didn’t feel like it but I still did. During the process, he grabbed a bag with 1 cookie I was saving for my partner because he loved them. I made a batch for us all and we all got some so it wasn’t not fair. He said “I’ll just throw it away”, I stopped him and directly and clearly said no, please don’t, that it was my partners. He ignored me and threw it away telling me it didn’t matter. I went silent and finished his food and went to my room because it made me feel horrible. The next couple days has been really rough. He been keeping me up all night being really loud in his room which he’s asked to be quiet and then he woke me up in the morning too. I expressed to my partner I was extremely grumpy from lack of sleep while being sick and told him I wanted space from my BIL so I wasn’t short with him. I tried to get it, but it was hard. Then he woke me up the next day too and I was really feeling unwell again. He then came in my room while I was trying to sleep and started laughing and talking over whatever was on my TV when I was trying to sleep with my partner who was sick too. That made me really upset too, I didn’t know what to do so I covered my head but I was getting extremely overwhelmed. I was exhausted, drained, and now I couldn’t even sleep in the day. The rest of the day was rough too, I went to play a game in my room when he was talking to my partner but then he got right in my ear and started yelling about my game. I kept my patience still because I do understand he didn’t know I was upset and uncomfortable. I later went to the bathroom and breathed so I could calm down. Later that night, I was trying to calm down still, but he was pacing in our kitchen as I tried to cook. I do totally understand pacing cause I do it too, but always in my room. The main problem is he only does it when I go out there and it makes me feel unable to function along with extremely anxious and he seems to get upset at if I or my cat are “in his way”. Eventually, my partner did ask if he could pace in his room which has way more space than our living room/kitchen. He had to ask 3 more times and then my BIL got pissed, muttered it wasn’t his problem my family traumatized me and went to his room. It made me feel horrible. Today, I felt a little better. My partner was at work and I decided to make a cup of coffee. My BIL heard me leave my room and he followed me out. He started ranting to me about how terrible, weak, bratty, and dumb women are. He wouldn’t stop, he kept repeating it and I went into freeze mode. He was actually scaring me and I feel bad saying that. I was going over several ways in my head to ask him to stop and explain I was uncomfortable, I knew I needed to be direct but he wouldn’t let me speak. He just kept telling me really sexist, mean things and insight on how he views me. I eventually was able to mutter out I was going to go work on my music and I know that wasn’t direct enough, I was just scared. He followed me to my room and continued to tell me these things plus more upsetting things. I told him I was going to work now and shut the door as soon as I could get him out and I just broke down sobbing. I was very hurt. I didn’t know what to do, but I told my partner what was going on. My partner came home later and tried to talk to his brother. He could barely say anything, he did eventually just say he needs to stop and his brother stormed off in his room and locked his door. My partner works again tomorrow and to be honest, now I’m afraid cause I’ll be home again. I don’t know what to do. ",1,1737194406.0,AutisticAdults,0,1.0,False

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

1i443b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1i443b7/i_miss_alcohol/,I miss alcohol,"(18 F) not an alcoholic or anything, but my father is - or was. idk what he's up to these days, but I do really miss drinking alot. ever since I been diagnosed with my chronic illnesses, I've been put on alot of meds for both as needed and daily use. and alcohol either greatly interacts with or just heightens/worsens the side effects of the meds that I'm on so I have to stay away from it. I just miss it. I always liked drinking more than smoking weed - sure it would make me a little sad and emotional sometimes but it'd make me feel buzzed and happy too at times. it's also just alot less complicated than weed is in terms of what it does to me and how it affects me. last time I smoked it actually made my pain worse and gave me an awful headache (and that was while I was on the meds) but with alcohol...it's just different. idk my body is weak and sensitive to drugs anyway and I've never been full on drunk, but now I may never be able to do so. and that makes me kinda sad. even just to drink socially or for the taste - I can't do it anymore. I tried making a mocktail but it's not the same. I dont even drink coffee anymore cause my meds can have their affect heightened by caffeine. the liver is so precious. idk, perhaps this is for the best and the universe's way of pushing me to put my health in a high priority, especially since I'm so young, but it sucks. being in this world and being sober with all this shit does suck and I wish I could drink all my feelings away even if I know it's bad. as much as an evil, abusive bastard as my dad is, I get why he loves to drink so much",1,1737192997.0,confessions,0,1.0,False

Reposting again - here's to optimism and not giving up.

I am a 35 year old single nerd (yes, very unique on reddit), both in personal and professional life. I am an expat living in the Netherlands but originally from India(oh dear, Indian, run away!! )

Still here?... well read on..

I have been away from home for more than 12 years, for both educational and professional reasons. Last 3 years were spent in the Netherlands. I am not sure where I will be tomorrow - perhaps back in Asia or US - life takes you places, but I am here for now and the loneliness is getting to me. It has been more than a year since I dated anyone and I am finally at a point where both mind and body desire some affection and intimacy. I am looking for a connection - be it just friendship with the possibility of something more, but a connection nonetheless.

More about me:

On a fitness journey. Trying to work out at least 4 days a week and eating healthy. I am getting stronger but there is much work to be done. The latter part has been harder as I absolutely love food - I think it is the single greatest pleasure of life. Would love to connect with someone who is also into fitness or at least seriously considering getting into it so we can encourage each other as opposed to enabling the bad habits.

I like the usual nerdy things - gaming, fantasy and sci-fiction, manga, and the occasional anime. Not a requirement that you be a nerd but it helps :)

I am a lifelong tourist, love traveling and enjoy road trips. Been to over 30 countries, always looking forward to my next vacation, and want to see the whole world!

Other details about me:

* Introvert
* Much more shy and socially awkward than I would like to be :p
* Politically liberal/left
* Don't smoke or drink alcohol, but coffee is my poison!
* Vegetarian
* Love touch and adore cuddles :)
* Non Vanilla, but that is for (much) later ;)

I am generally an easy going and an agreeable person, but strong religious inclinations and an anti-science mindset are absolute deal breakers. This is already too long so lastly, I am looking for something IRL and would prefer speaking to people who are in the Netherlands or within short distances.

If my post resonates with you, do reach out and please leave an introduction.

Stay safe,

Cheers!",0,1737192665.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

Would love to connect with someone who is also into fitness or at least seriously considering getting into it so we can encourage each other as opposed to enabling the bad habits.

I like the usual nerdy things - gaming, fantasy and sci-fiction, manga, and the occasional anime. Not a requirement that you be a nerd but it helps :)

I am a lifelong tourist, love traveling and enjoy road trips. Been to over 30 countries, always looking forward to my next vacation, and want to see the whole world!

Other details about me:

* Introvert
* Much more shy and socially awkward than I would like to be :p
* Politically liberal/left
* Don't smoke or drink alcohol, but coffee is my poison!
* Vegetarian
* Love touch and adore cuddles :)
* Non Vanilla, but that is for (much) later ;)

I am generally an easy going and an agreeable person, but strong religious inclinations and an anti-science mindset are absolute deal breakers. This is already too long so lastly, I am looking for something IRL and would prefer speaking to people who are in the Netherlands or within short distances.

If my post resonates with you, do reach out and please leave an introduction.

Stay safe,

Cheers!",1,1737192663.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I just need someone to reassure me or just flat out tell me I’m a bad person because I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m not trying to sound like a condescending jerk but my god. I’m no Albert Einstein but I feel like no around me understands how any thing works, especially my family. Specifically my mom and sister. Sometimes talking to them gets so stressful I feel like sobbing. It’s even worse than talking to a wall, at least a wall would just shut up and do nothing, they constantly bring up old arguments about random shit that is self explanatory. I love going out to school to meet other people because i get thrilled when someone’s smarter than me. I have to have at least one friend that’s smarter than me or I’ll lose it. Even when I’m watching a show with my family, it’s like they have no sense of empathy, compassion, or logic beneath their blank, judging faces. It’s even worse when I don’t understand something, because it means they go back and forth arguing, saying the wrong thing and making the wrong point each time. I know it’s horrible to view life through such a dull lense but it’s so hard. I don’t want to think of them as dumb, especially since their neurodivergent (they both have adhd and I’m autistic, all diagnosed by a licensed health professional) and they have expressed how dumb they feel at times. I just feel like crying every time they open their mouths. I can barely watch shows or movies with them because they won’t get it. They talk over important parts and then get confused when they don’t know what’s going on. After explaining it as calmly as I can, I politely ask them to be quiet, but then they get mad and yell at me. When I do the same to interrupt parts with commentary (after pausing it, of course) they start yelling at me for stopping it. I can’t ask for help with homework or anything because they will just tell me the obvious, surface level stuff. After I tell them I already know that, they say “well why do you need help then?”. I have one friend that’s smarter than me and he’s my saving grace. It’s so free in to have someone that corrects me when I’m wrong and tells me about things I’ve never heard off, but he’s not there all the time. I just really feel like I can’t take it anymore. I despise feeling like they’re all dumb and I’m superior to them but Jesus, it’s liking living with two toddlers. But even a toddler would understand empathy if I sat down and explained it to them. My mother and sister constantly tell me things I already know months or even years after I’ve learned it. I’m also the youngest in my house so it feels kind of pathetic in a kicked puppy way having to explain simple things to people years older than me. I love going to my aunts house or hanging out with my uncle because I finally feel like I have people that match up to my intellect. The people I live with try to explain politics to me, but they get it all wrong. I’m autistic and I have a special interest in history and politics, so it hurts me physically to see people be so wrong about so much. I just want this lifted off my shoulders. I feel like such a dickhead for even thinking this way. 
I also have a very neat and clean way about thinking of things. I’ve had my life planned out since I was about 7 and it’s going just as I planned, with a few tweaks here and there as I get older and more knowledgeable of course. My sister has never worked a day in her life and just constantly complains about how hard it is. Unlike her, I have basic empathy, so I don’t say how I really feel about it, I just reassure her. I wish I was old enough to get a job. I want to work. I want a boring 9-5. I want to talk to the same people and crack boring jokes by the office coffee maker.

 I am new to the hobby and just need an advice. I am thinking of buying my first grinder but I am torn between these two.

I am considering the baratza because it is automatic, around the same price and looks like a lot of bambino owners use the combination. My only worry is the noise(I make coffee at 7am) + they say machine grinders can make it more bitter compared to handgrinders.

I am thinking of the K4 initially but since it's not available in the UK I thought of getting the K6. Only con is the manual grinding which isn't too much of a bother, and I read some people say that it's prone to rust. Also seeing the prices are similar that's why I hesitated buying this.

I’ve been lifting for a while now and, until now, my pre-workout routine has been pretty simple – just **5 grams of salt** and **1 packet of Nescafe coffee**. My stack consists of **creatine** and **whey protein**, and it has been working well for me.

But recently, I decided to try a **pre-workout supplement** for the first time, and I went with **Fuel One Dead-Lift Pre-Workout** since it’s from a reputed brand (manufactured by Bright Lifecare Pvt. Ltd.) and is very affordable.

Here’s the breakdown of ingredients per serving (7.5g):

* **L-Citrulline DL-Malate:** 3000 mg
* **Beta-Alanine:** 3000 mg
* **Caffeine:** 200 mg
* **L-Theanine:** 200 mg

My workouts are around **2 hours long**, involving **very heavy sets** followed by **cardio**. I want to know if this pre-workout is good for my routine and whether these dosages are decent for someone with my workout intensity.

Also, should I **stop taking the salt and coffee combo** before workouts now that I’m using this pre-workout?

Any advice or feedback on this purchase and how to maximize its benefits would be super helpful. Appreciate your insights, gymbros!

Many locals don't know the difference between vegetarian food and vegan food. The terms [เจ](https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=de&text=%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%88&op=translate) (""jeh"", ""vegetarian"" from my understanding) and [มังสวิรัติ](https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=de&text=%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B4&op=translate) (""mạngs̄wirạt"", ""vegan"" from my understanding) are being used synonymously. Even Google translates มังสวิรัติ with ""vegetarian"" and Wikipedia compounds the fact by grading มังสวิรัติ (""mạngs̄wirạt"") from ""vegetarian"" to ""vegan"".

So yeah, I do not blame anyone for making it hard to find vegan food there, it's what it is. It is however something visiting vegans should keep in mind.

I found only 1 shop with explictly vegan dishes at Bangkoks Suvarnabumi airport: Coffee World (of all places lol) on level B (watch out, there are 2, I mean the one with tables to sit at).

And no, I do not want to discuss ""leaving out the meat"" with the locals. My Thai skills are not good enough anyways.

She and I have been friends since high school, and whilst I’ve had mixed feelings about the partner, I thought it would be a good chance to really get to know him and really see for myself. 

Well… to summarise, my partner said on the last night. Is Alice colour blind? Because she is ignoring a lot of red flags. But let me explain the red flags. 

1. He always has to 1 up. Let’s say that we’re talking and someone shares a story that’s relevant to the conversation. He HAS to tell you another better story that is also related. Every. Single. Time. But an even better example, we went back to their room to play some card games before bed. (We aren’t really the party type). My bf comments on the shirt he’s wearing which has a sporting team that I have no idea about on it. He instantly goes, “yeah, I saw someone in the gym with the same logo. I got chatting with him and challenged him to go set for set.” For those unaware, this is a variation on the good old “ego lift” where he HAS to prove that he’s better or at least worth being involved in the conversation. To me, it’s just pure insecurity. 

2. That same game night, he’s wearing the shirt. That he wore to the gym. That afternoon. No shower, no change of clothes, just cologne… 

3. He has an obsession with cologne. Alice and I were having a coffee just us whilst the boys went into a sporting goods store and she mentioned that she feels responsible for his cologne obsession. She used to mention to him early on in their relationship that he smelt after the gym, and at one point, she bought him a cologne. It started a WHOLE thing where now he goes into every store and looks at colognes. Bro, just take a shower… 

4. He’s also OBSESSED with the gym. He says that it’s a way to help him focus, it got him through high school and I can understand that. But I think it’s a bit of body dysmorphia as well, but I’m not in any position to diagnose. But that same convo about the cologne also included talk about how he starts to get depressed if he doesn’t go to the gym at least once every other day, and he talks A LOT about being worried he’s going to get fat. 

4.5. During their first relationship, I made a joke about how he’s skinny. He is very lean, no question about it. He told Alice that she should stop interacting with me because I have no respect. She obviously didn’t take that advice, but she told me about it and it clearly put her in an uncomfortable position. 

5. He also occasionally guilts her into going to the gym. Do I even need to say more on this one? 

6. He can just be a bit of a childish a-hole for the sake of it… idk how to describe it, but I work with teenagers and he just reminds me of a lot of the boys I work with. My BF works in the same field as me, and when I said I feel like he’s stuck at 19 yrs old, he said that was generous, and it’s more like he’s 16 and stuck in high school. 

And finally… 
7. They broke up before, and got back together a year later. The main reason for the breakup? Ding ding ding you guessed it! His ✨ insecurities ✨  [that includes a fake story about a cat he supposedly sewed clothes for and posted on his Instagram story when they first met to impressed her, which is a big part of why they broke up the first time…]

I need to tell her, but idk about without being a bitch about it. She’s an incredible person and can go SO MUCH BETTER than him. I’m thinking next time we catch up for lunch or dinner, if it gets brought up to just talk about the red flags, but am I being too nosey? It’s her life, but I also don’t want to see her be hurt by this guy. If she was really happy, would she have brought up these issues also every single time we were alone? Or am I reading too much? [I’m also ND, so over thinking is my speciality]

1i43akl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1i43akl/how_to_choose_furniture_that_fits_your_space_and/,How to Choose Furniture That Fits Your Space and Style Perfectly,"Choosing the right furniture for your home is both an art and a science. Your furniture should not only fit your space but also reflect your personal style and meet your functional needs. Whether you’re furnishing a new home or updating your current space, this guide will help you select pieces that combine form, function, and flair.

# 1. Measure Your Space: The Foundation of Great Design

Before you fall in love with that perfect [armchair Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/armchairs) or a gorgeous [rattan side tables](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/tables/outdoor-side-tables), take the time to measure your space. Knowing the dimensions of your rooms ensures that your chosen furniture fits well without overcrowding or leaving awkward gaps.

**Tips for Measuring:**

* Use painter's tape to outline the dimensions of larger items like sofas or dining tables.
* Keep pathways clear to ensure your space remains functional and inviting.

# 2. Consider Your Lifestyle and Needs

Your choice of furniture should align with your lifestyle. For example:

* Families with kids or pets might prioritize durable, stain-resistant materials.
* Minimalists may prefer streamlined furniture with hidden storage.
* Entertainers might focus on stylish and functional seating, like armchairs from Dubai known for their luxurious design.

**Lifestyle Tip:** A [stylish side table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables) with storage can double as a practical and elegant piece in living rooms or bedrooms.

# 3. Focus on Style: Make It Personal

Your furniture is a reflection of your personality and design aesthetic. Whether you love modern minimalism, bohemian vibes, or classic elegance, choose pieces that complement your home's overall look.

**Stylish Picks to Consider:**

* Rattan side tables for a chic, natural touch that pairs beautifully with boho or coastal decor.
* Sleek armchairs for a modern living room upgrade—explore armchair Dubai collections for options that balance comfort and sophistication.

# 4. Balance Proportion and Scale

Finding furniture that fits your room’s scale is essential for creating a harmonious space. Large furniture in small rooms can feel overwhelming, while undersized pieces in a large room can look out of place.

**Pro Tip:** Pair larger furniture like sofas with smaller accents such as a stylish side table or a compact rattan side table to maintain balance and visual interest.

# 5. Think Functionality: Form Meets Utility

Every piece of furniture should serve a purpose while looking great. Multifunctional furniture is especially useful in smaller spaces.

**Functional Ideas:**

* A coffee table with hidden storage or a lift-top design for dual-purpose use.
* Accent chairs that double as reading nooks or additional seating during gatherings.
* Lightweight rattan side tables that can be easily moved around for versatility.

# 6. Shop with Purpose: Find the Right Home Furniture Store

Choosing the right [home furniture shop](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) is just as important as selecting the furniture itself. Look for stores that offer a wide range of designs, high-quality materials, and expert advice to help you make the right choices.

**Where to Start:** If you’re in Dubai, explore local retailers offering exclusive collections of armchairs, side tables, and other furniture pieces that combine timeless design with modern trends.

# 7. Incorporate Unique Accents for Personality

While large furniture anchors your room, smaller pieces like side tables and decor add character. A stylish side table, whether made of rattan, glass, or wood, can enhance the aesthetic of your room without overwhelming it.

**Design Tip:** Use side tables to display decorative items like vases, books, or candles for a personal touch.

# 8. Stay Flexible: Mix and Match

Your furniture doesn’t need to match perfectly—mixing styles can create a layered and dynamic look. Combine a cozy armchair Dubai with a rustic rattan side table for a chic blend of textures and styles.

**Bonus Tip:** Stick to a cohesive color palette to tie different pieces together seamlessly.

**Final Thoughts**

Choosing furniture that fits your space and style is all about balance—balancing size with proportion, function with beauty, and personal taste with practicality. Whether you’re looking for a stunning armchair Dubai, a stylish side table, or versatile rattan side tables, take the time to plan your purchases carefully.

Visit a reputable home furniture shop to explore options that align with your needs and preferences. With the right approach, you’ll create a home that feels stylish, functional, and uniquely yours.",1,1737189436.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

""☕️ Coffee lovers

Just crafted the perfect cup using rare Jamaica Blue Mountain beans on my Jura E8. 

The silky crema and bright, well-balanced flavor profile of these wood-roasted beans paired perfectly with the precision of Swiss engineering. Set the grinder to medium-fine, temperature to high, and let the E8 work its magic. The result? A smooth, complex cup with subtle notes of chocolate and absolutely zero bitterness.

Pro tip: Use the double-walled glass cup to maintain the perfect temperature while showcasing that beautiful crema! 

Anyone else tried Jamaica Blue Mountain? What's your favorite way to brew these exceptional beans?

1i437pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Umrah/comments/1i437pc/my_first_48h_in_makkah/,My first 48h in Makkah ,"Salam,

Alhamdulillah, feeling very grateful to be here in Makkah, and I just wanted to share some thoughts as I have been reading many posts from people who went.  

1- The crowds somehow did not bother me at all. As someone who suffers from social anxiety, being here with so many Muslims makes me feel safe physically, emotionally, and psychologically. Even though I was getting pushed and shoved, it made me so emotional because I know deep down that it was out of passion for Islam, and I realize that some people may have saved a lifetime to get here.  

2- Performing Umrah was a wonderful experience. The Kaaba is so insanely beautiful, and Masjid Al Haram has a unique vibe, especially at Maghrib and Fajr time. I hadn't realized how physical it was, but this made the experience even more meaningful. I loved seeing the healthy family members caring for their elderly and sick relatives and assisting them through it. I got so emotional hearing people crying during sujood, wondering how much they must have been through, and realizing that we are all mostly concerned about past sins and mistakes, hoping for Allah's forgiveness. It made me feel less lonely. The great voices of the muezzins and imams leading the prayers, which I had only heard on TV or TikTok, were so moving.  

3- The transport system and payment options are very easy. Just beware of the taxi drivers and their exorbitant prices. I just used the hotel's shuttle, walked, or took an Uber for farther destinations.  

4- I know many people complain about the guards, and I might have an unpopular opinion due to my professional background, but I don't think people realize how difficult their job is. They have to be firm, and people must follow their orders since they are in charge of the security of the holiest place on earth and the safety of millions of individuals, some of whom may not be in the best condition. Organizing everyone to be on time for five prayers a day is a huge task. I truly admire them. I only saw them lose patience with those who wouldn’t listen to them, and they were absolutely right to do so.  

5- I felt incredibly safe as a young Muslim woman. Yes, some men stare, but overall people are very mindful. For example, men would allow me to sit on the bus. Workers and guards treated women respectfully, making sure they didn’t touch them. My Uber driver explained the different areas, the customs guard was friendly, and hotel staff were all respectful and kind. Even in the middle of the crowds trying to reach the escalators, men would offer to let me pass.  

6- That being said, I also felt even safer with all the women here. Many smiled at me, and in the elevators, we’d move closer to one another to create distance from men. I loved seeing all the different hijab styles and had the pleasure of seeing so many niqabi women, something I rarely see in Canada. I loved seeing mothers caring for their children while worshiping Allah. I also loved seeing all the women who work at Masjid Al Haram wearing niqab.  

7- I enjoyed the food; everything is halal, so no worries at all. The flavors and scents were a mix of biryani,  lamb, dates, musk, and a bit of street dust. This took me back to my childhood in Canadian mosques, as the smells are very similar. I loved the fact that there are restaurants offering free meals to those in need and a charity system allowing people to donate and buy meals in many restaurants.  

8- I enjoyed having coffee after Fajr with the view of Masjid Al Haram and imagining how life must have been in Makkah during the Prophet Muhammad’s (pbuh) time.  

9- The chaos in the streets, the sun, the birds, the morning breeze—all of it. Seeing people coming from Umrah or heading to Umrah, rushing to prayer, seeing people from all socio-economic backgrounds, and reminding myself of how Allah has perfectly planned each of our lives. Seeing people worship and believe in something greater and how much discipline Islam requires was incredibly humbling. 

I pray that all Muslims around the world get to experience this and Hajj, Insha’Allah.

Mumbai Suburbs—near any kind of station would be a cherry on the cake  
A ₹1 crore budget. Room for a little more  
Bonus points if the doors don’t creak louder than my budget constraints.

What I’m avoiding:

1. ""Fixer-uppers"" that need more fixing than I can emotionally handle.
2. Properties labeled “cozy” that make me wonder if I should buy furniture or shrink myself instead.
3. Sales pitches that begin with ""This is the last one!"" Spoiler alert: It never is.

So here’s the plan: I’ll save the brokerage fee and spend it on coffee to survive this marathon. If you know of a hidden gem in the suburbs that’s waiting for its new *very grateful* owner, slide into my DMs or drop a lead in the comments.

Please help me find me a home that says “welcome” instead of “what were you thinking?”

NO. Unfortunately did OP clarify this pretty late into the conversation which Meet-up it was. 


Was there a similar Situation on the sober Sunday Meet-up? 

NO.

It was disheartening to see how much hate against Meet-ups in general is out there. 
As if all Meet-ups are the same.

I know that there is a problem, I heard about it many times. 

But how can there be change if we don't work on it? 

I was in a really bad spot and in a moment of weakness I even considered cancelling everything. 

But really good people from the Meet-up encouraged me to not give up. 

That this Meet-up is different. It's not the usual Time or Space or setup for a Meet-up. 
There is no club going afterwards or drinking till the liver surrenders. 

It's a Bookclub without the books. 

This filled me with determination. Not just to prove the haters wrong, but to build something as a good example going forward. 

No Party, no alcohol, no creeps. 

‼️ if there should be an Situation at the Meet-up that makes you uncomfortable please reach out to me immediately, I will not tolerate any despicable behaviour ‼️

I (27f) was dating this guy (24m) from work for a couple of months. Everything was going amazingly and he seems like an incredible, genuine guy. He put in effort, zero red flags, taking it slow, etc. He planned dates and talked to me consistently. He did lots of little things for me like grabbing me a coffee on his break, walking me to my car etc. We did everything a couple did except have sex, we didn’t do that yet and he wasn’t pressuring me. We held hands and would kiss, and there was zero indication he didn’t want a serious relationship with me, he made it so abundantly clear how much he really liked me. He has said he wasn’t talking to anyone else even though we weren’t officially bf and gf yet, and the way he acted towards me and the effort he put in made me believe that. He has a 2 year old son, and I’m the first serious person he’s pursued since leaving his baby mama. 

Also, we started off as friends for the first month and talked and hung out a lot. I could tell he liked me but I was nervous at first about going for it since I felt insecure about my past relationships and wanted to be as “perfect” as I could be before dating again. He talked to me about it and said that’s something you could work on with your partner, I thought about it a lot and decided I would date him because I ended up liking him a lot. Everything was going perfectly. 

So tell me why he starts acting different the past few days and last night he calls me and says he realized he just isn’t ready and feels emotionally unavailable because of him having a kid? He realized he just doesn’t know how to navigate a relationship right now with his kid. But I’m trying to understand why he isn’t taking his own advice he gave me and why he wouldn’t want to be with me if he was serious about me, which again I had no indication that he wasn’t. Zero fuck boy or narc vibes whatsoever. Our communication was amazing. He said he couldn’t deal with how he would “treat me” (referring to messing up sometimes like passing out when we had plans or canceling plans sometimes due to his kid” but I made it clear how understanding I was that he is a single father and that I am not the priority. None of it bothered me. I couldn’t stop texting him afterwards about how hurt and misled I feel, and that I feel like he’s lying and that there’s someone else.. he apologized again and said he understands and that he really did not mean to hurt me. He kept reassuring over the phone that it’s nothing about me and that it isn’t someone else or unresolved feelings for his ex, etc. He also mentioned something about realizing he’s not able to deal with the fact that his son won’t have his two parents together, but that doesn’t mean he wants to be with her (he broke up with her 7-9 months ago). He said it would be hard for me to understand without having a child of my own. He said he didn’t know this when he first tried with me  and that none of his feelings were a lie but I’m having a hard time understanding.

Please help me understand, this feels so out of left field and I’m devastated. I really thought this man was super into me. He is the one that came up to me and he asked my coworkers about me before he did.

Are there any brands I should try, or stay away from? and specifically for people who live in Canada, where do you order yours from?",1,1737188395.0,Soda,0,1.0,False

It seems like with some of these devices you can only use pods? Are the pods only devices easier? For pour over I've always just relied on pre ground coffee.",1,1737188136.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Circa 2010 I met a guy online who was everything I could have wanted in a man; a gentleman, funny, handsome, and topped off with a southern drawl that was smooth like honey
A few years went by and we met in person. He flew to my country. It was electric. Chemistry off the charts. 
I ended up having to fly to Texas for a week and he just happened to be there too, so we saved on a hotel together.
A year later, it just so happened we had flights layover at the same time in an airport across the world where we live, so we went for coffee and a hot heavy kiss. 
After that, I flew to where he was stationed where we spent a weekend tangled up in bedsheets and out of breathe. 
This was the last time I saw him. 
It just felt all so special, so kismet. 
We kind of went down different life paths, but that doesn’t mean I don’t think of him more often than I’d like to admit, and crave the kind of relationship we had. It was so easy, the flow just didn’t stop. I’ve kissed him in more countries than I’ve kissed any one person in different countries.

I just need to put this into the techno cloud in the sky because it hurts my heart to think of this amazing type of love I had and although it was never anything official, it was real and it was life changing. 

Im 31F and this happened all throughout my whole 20’s. ",5,1737188106.0,confession,5,0.78,False
1i42z0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i42z0b/anyone_with_kids_help_me_understand/,"Anyone with kids, help me understand?","I (27f) was dating this guy (24m) from work for a couple of months. Everything was going amazingly and he seems like an incredible, genuine guy. He put in effort, zero red flags, taking it slow, etc. He planned dates and talked to me consistently. He did lots of little things for me like grabbing me a coffee on his break, walking me to my car etc. We did everything a couple did except have sex, we didn’t do that yet and he wasn’t pressuring me. We held hands and would kiss, and there was zero indication he didn’t want a serious relationship with me, he made it so abundantly clear how much he really liked me. He has said he wasn’t talking to anyone else even though we weren’t officially bf and gf yet, and the way he acted towards me and the effort he put in made me believe that. He has a 2 year old son, and I’m the first serious person he’s pursued since leaving his baby mama. 

Also, we started off as friends for the first month and talked and hung out a lot. I could tell he liked me but I was nervous at first about going for it since I felt insecure about my past relationships and wanted to be as “perfect” as I could be before dating again. He talked to me about it and said that’s something you could work on with your partner, I thought about it a lot and decided I would date him because I ended up liking him a lot. Everything was going perfectly. 

So tell me why he starts acting different the past few days and last night he calls me and says he realized he just isn’t ready and feels emotionally unavailable because of him having a kid? He realized he just doesn’t know how to navigate a relationship right now with his kid. But I’m trying to understand why he isn’t taking his own advice he gave me and why he wouldn’t want to be with me if he was serious about me, which again I had no indication that he wasn’t. Zero fuck boy or narc vibes whatsoever. Our communication was amazing. He said he couldn’t deal with how he would “treat me” (referring to messing up sometimes like passing out when we had plans or canceling plans sometimes due to his kid” but I made it clear how understanding I was that he is a single father and that I am not the priority. None of it bothered me. I couldn’t stop texting him afterwards about how hurt and misled I feel, and that I feel like he’s lying and that there’s someone else.. he apologized again and said he understands and that he really did not mean to hurt me. He kept reassuring over the phone that it’s nothing about me and that it isn’t someone else or unresolved feelings for his ex, etc. He also mentioned something about realizing he’s not able to deal with the fact that his son won’t have his two parents together, but that doesn’t mean he wants to be with her (he broke up with her 7-9 months ago). He said it would be hard for me to understand without having a child of my own. He said he didn’t know this when he first tried with me  and that none of his feelings were a lie but I’m having a hard time understanding.

Please help me understand, this feels so out of left field and I’m devastated. I really thought this man was super into me. He is the one that came up to me and he asked my coworkers about me before he did. He just took me out in a date 3 days ago and called me just to talk in the morning and talked about doing other things in the near future ..",2,1737187965.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
