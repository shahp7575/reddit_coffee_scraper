He was physically and extremely emotionally abusive almost my whole life, he has been financially abusive to the point my brother and I grew up malnourished despite him earning ¬£250k plus annually as he refused to buy groceries, or pay household bills‚Ä¶ he pulled me out of the school I was flourishing in to place me somewhere cheaper and I was bullied, he did the same with my brother. He helped my brother with university but not me as I am a girl. He has called us both every name under the sun and been viciously homophobic to my brother and misogynistic towards me. He has berated us and mocked us and resented us for having ‚Äòmore‚Äô than he did growing up, although we never did. He used to beat us and he deliberately broke our toys, never allowed us to have doors closed up to the age of 25 (we still lived at home due to extreme mental health effects of this control and abuse). He has never showed any remorse for any of this whatsoever. He has evident cognitive limitations as well as being a typical narcissist. I didn‚Äôt speak to him for a few years but then was forced to see him during the divorce to mediate between my parents. He sold our house from under us and my Mum had to move into a one bedroom flat instead of the five bedroom home she had decorated and thought she‚Äôd live in forever. I moved in with my boyfriend and have struggled with very poor mental health, unemployment, and mystery physical health issues that I‚Äôm pretty certain stem from the stress and anguish of my childhood and adolescence. I tried to coexist with him and be civil after my parents divorce around four years back but - the way he never showed remorse or talked about anything he‚Äôd done to me, the way he never behaved like a parent, not even paying for my coffee when meeting up, for instance, made me feel I was doing myself a disservice. I didn‚Äôt block him but stopped messaging and he never attempted to reach out to me, not even to check if I was alright. I am poor. My boyfriend is disabled. My life is so hard and I cry every week as I‚Äôm worried I will not be in a position to have children by the end of my child bearing years as a result. He has cost me my twenties. I should have been working but I have been recovering. Or so I thought, I was mostly done.

Flash forward to the pressent day. 

On New Year‚Äôs Day (narcissists always come out of the woodwork around significant dated and holidays as we all know) he sent me a cryptic message addressed to both of us (he has never treated us as or respected us as individuals) saying he had something important to share and would love to reconnect. I had a panic attack because I was sure it meant he was 1) remarrying or 2) having another child. I didn‚Äôt want to open myself up to an ambush especially with the entirety of everything he has cost me being left unsaid only for him to doubtlessly spring more trauma on me. My Mum and partner told me not to catastrophisme and ignore it, Mum said she‚Äôd try to find out through the grapevine and let me know what was wrong. I didn‚Äôt see her for a few weeks as she was abroad and tried not to think about it. Well I saw her yesterday and my brother and I sat me down and told me my father has an approximately one year old child and is living with some Eastern European woman who speaks no English and is in her late thirties at best. 

I don‚Äôt think I need to explain why this is such a shock to me. How can he still reject and harm me, how can he casually message me saying he ‚Äòhas news‚Äô and ‚Äòwould love to reconnect‚Äô but understands if we‚Äôre not ready, how can he address the vague message to BOTH of us despite it being this serious, how can he not have told us during the pregnancy or even when this child was born? How can he be raising a child when he didnt raise us? 

He has completely screwed us with regards to his will, I‚Äôm sure members of this group understand but I settled the fact I would never benefit from him with myself years ago, but told myself at least when he dies I‚Äôll receive a small sum to put towards something that heals me, and makes up for the neglect. Now he will doubtlessly cut us out and spend all of his assets on raising this new child. I have a half sibling I wouldn‚Äôt recognise on the street who is almost thirty years younger than me. When he is my age I will be around 60. I went to the doctors for an emergency appointment and to be put in therapy and I sobbed in the waiting room thinking about how every single part of my mental issues is caused by my father whether I am in touch with him or not. I have been fine in medicated and not in therapy finally moving on and he has dealt me this blow. He has replaced us. I am stressed about the will, about getting legal advice, about ownership of my grandmothers grave even as it is a double grave and I don‚Äôt want him to be buried in it, he also has several of her possessions I want back and ALL our childhood videos and albums. I don‚Äôt know if this makes sense I know there it too much information and not enough detail here but I feel I am losing my mind, and don‚Äôt know where else to turn. My brother is less upset as he has no good memories of my father in childhood which I honestly envy. But I thought he loved me once, albeit when I was very young. I cannot believe he wouldn‚Äôt even tell me this. I am really processing it for the first time that he does not even care about me. ",1,1737420281.0,EstrangedAdultKids,1,1.0,False

I would love insight from an Avoidant- I just want to get over  my DA(?) ex but also just miss him so badly. My ex told me I was the only person he's discarded and I'm so confused.**

I've decided not to date for a long time after this but I'm genuinely confused and want to fix whatever is broken within me that's causing this to happen. Because Ive dated 2 DAs prior to this and I just want to attract secure partners.

I met my ex in March at the coffee shop I work at when he ran in, saw me, stopped and told me how beautiful my eyes were. He was so forward and seemingly written out of a book. He had charm, charisma, and made me feel like I was floating. We didnt see each other again or date until July but during that gap, he was asking our mutual friends about me and began pursuing me pretty heavily. I should've listened to my body because I felt anxiety about how fast he was trying to move and how immediately I was showered with compliments and affection. I had some friends who were concerned but others who really thought it was genuine.

We connected when I got out of an abusive relationship and ended up talking for hours on end, multiple nights in a row. We quickly got hooked onto each other and moved at an unhealthy pace. He told me he had a good family history and had previously been in a 4 year relationship - he seemed secure to me. He took me on a date the next week and we stayed up until 8am just talking. He ended up staying the night and we got intimate the next morning.

I told him i wanted to start slow bc i was alarmed at the speed he was going and I had just gotten out of a relationship. After we got intimate on our first date, he said something like ""I dont even know what we're doing"" and laughed and kept offering a ""go with the flow"" ""i do you, you do me"" but we remain committed to each other and head towards a relationship. I told him I wanted to date with intention and that he didnt want a situationship and he completely agreed but was still pretty vague with actual intentions. He was pretty busy with running and work, but saw me whenever he could. He would come into my work and kiss me very publicly, kiss me in the middle of my sentences, interrupt me to tell me how lovely and beautiful I was, and tell me how safe he felt with me. The ""safe"" thing always worried me because my previous DA ex would say that too. But our chemistry was unlike anything I had experienced and he truly seemed like a hopeless romantic, written out of a book. He would play me soul music in the morning, cook for me always, and was simply just so sweet on me.

I started to notice in the beginning that he would shut down when anything emotional came up. Or if I told him how i felt about him and gave him compliments, he would change the subject or make it lighthearted somehow. He asked me about my abusive mom in the beginning and once he noticed I was tearing up, he went to go shower mid-sentence and came back without saying a word. A couple of weeks later, I fell down the stairs and he didnt ask if i was okay and refused to talk about it.. He didnt even come down, he just stood at the top until I got up (i was pretty bruised. it was a hard fall). He never said a word about it after that, even if i brought up my bruise or how silly that was.

After a month, he had some big life changes. He quit his job (he has quit a lot of jobs.. this time to pursue modeling which has not panned out.) and he moved into a new house. During this time, he stopped calling me beautiful, stopped showering me with affection, and started to be pretty distant but would be great in person. He didnt initiate hangouts as much or visit me at work as often, but said he was busy. I noticed that anytime I would bring up a need, he would shut down or avoid what i said altogether and just change the subject into something really lighthearted.

When it came to his past relationships , he always mentioned that they never talked about things. That me having basic conversations about dating expectations were as far as he had gotten in communication with other ex's. He had gotten out of a 4 year relationship less than a year before. They started off long distance, then both moved to our state together and he has described their relationship as very toxic.. She was avoidant and their relationship had a rocky start bc he had sex with his ex while they were casually dating, wanting to keep her side of the relationship polyamorous but always accused him of cheating, though he's very monogamous. They went to couples therapy and tried what they could. He said they both just randomly lost feelings. He would post the SWEETEST things about her and seemed so emotionally available with her, but he told me he was just trying to fix things.. But the way he treated her online was how he treated me in the beginning. He was the sweetest boy I had ever met before things suddenly changed.His other ex relationships he said lasted 6 months and they both broke up with him out of the blue. (one was his roommate that overlapped with his last ex. They continued to live together even while he and his recent ex dated) He also described them as push pull but said he would still always go visit them at work, went official with them, and was upset because they didnt want to remain friends. though i get confused because he told me they told him he was very robotic and cold towards them in the end.

One day out of nowhere, about 2 months in he told me he didnt have time for a relationship and that maybe i wanted too much from him that he couldnt give based on his running schedule (he started to become ""too busy"" and didnt want to lose himself to a relationship). But once he offered friendship and I said no, his heart seemed broken and he told me he had no intention on breaking up with me but wanted to see how our lives fit together with his schedule. We agreed on only seeing each other 1x a week so that he could focus on running and prioritize his life, although this felt really shitty on my end. I tried my best to be supportive, even though i was feeling really anxious and heartbroken.

When i would try to bring things up or ask for reassurance (before you come at me, i did my best to be very ""chill cool girl"" about it), he would shut down and not respond and then later come back with a response that was SO reassuring that even my therapist and friends were fooled. It made me think i was overthinking it all and he really was just an overly laid back guy with ADHD. He'd apologize and say hed work on being better at communicating. Communication was AWFUL at this point. (very inconsistent, all about his schedule, mostly about him, mostly about trail running..) No matter how anxious he'd make me,  he always reassured me, was still VERY physically affectionate (though not in public anymore. again, when i started to show it back he stepped back), and mainly just limited physical sweet connection to sex. But he would say things that made me think i was still just overthinking it all.

**T**hen finally, we had the best weekend and then he went on a 10 day running trip. He was so distant while he was gone, but this wasnt anything i wasnt used to at this point, and he would post on Instagram without checking in (which is fine but he was very blatantly ignoring me lol). He'd respond to me in the morning and then send a message right before bed, but was online all throughout the day and said he didnt do much throughout the days. I sent a text asking if he could just sends a heads up if he didnt want to talk that day (i tried to make it v sweet and not accusatory) and he ignored me all night. I sent another text apologizing and blaming myself for asking too much -- this was the biggest spiral i had gone into lol i really try not to show it to him. and then he responded in the morning with a text kind of brushing it over, apologizing, saying it wasnt a big expectation and he understood, and then a million other texts about running.

He always would say he'd do better, but would end up being more distant than before. But then when we were together, hed get really sweet and have moments where he acted in love like he did in the beginning.. But the amount of distance starting to overshadow the good. But the good would be SO GOOD and he'd be so sweet again.

We went a few weeks seeing each other in between his trip and mine, taking each other to and from the airport and when we finally were done with our trips he was being so sweet again and I was so excited that things were seeming normal once again. He picked me up from the airport and the next morning, he took me out to a diner and again, something seemed so off. I asked him what was going on and he said ""I just want to be friends"" (he had no intentions of telling me that day and i had just stayed the night at his house)

He told me that he didnt see me romantically and there was no possibility of him seeing me romantically. He was INSISTENT on being friends and having me in his life, doing all of the same things that we had before like talking about life, going to concerts, etc, but not as frequently. He told me he just didnt desire me and that he no longer wanted to make me a priority in his life.. he also kept going back and forth between saying that i was the ""only person he's lost interest in like this"" and ""this is a pattern and he doesn't know why he does it"". ?????? He told me about his other relationships and how they left him out of nowhere (he has this belief that people always leave, which we talked about in the beginning), and how he wanted to try with them but they just left and  
didnt want to be friends.. Though he said he was told he was robotic with them.. How his other relationships were very push pull and with me, he just didnt have a desire to ""come back"" like he did in his other relationships. He said he used to be able to see a future with me and now he cant. That we're a ""mismatch"" and ""incompatible"" but he cant give me any answers as to why.

he told me i had done nothing wrong and had only been supportive and loving from the start. he said he didnt lost any attraction for me and there was no one else, that he couldn't even date right now if he tried. but he simply didnt see me romantically and still wanted friendship with me. he said he had been contemplating this before his trip and was wondering why he didnt desire me, but didnt have any answers.. he really said i was the only person hes done this to. He seemed like he didnt care other than just feeling guilt and he wanted to meet the following week to talk about being friends.

Then he went on a trip and was stone cold towards me (I hardly texted him, just to figure out the logistics of when we'd meet up. I dated a DA before and was trying to be respectful of the assumed space he'd need.) He was cold towards me until we eventually made it work for him to come to my house two weeks later.

When he finally came to my house, i told him i couldnt have him in my life. But then it was the first time i hadnt seen him as his usual positive and sweet self. He looked horrible and started talking for an hour about how he cant get a job, cant keep anyone close in his life (literally said his two closest people live with him and its out of convenience. he hasnt even known them a year and neither of them tell him really anything in their lives.) He was telling me about how horrible his life was and how he made it this way and this was all his fault.. I had never heard him talk like this before and honestly was shocked. Again, he comes off as very charming and secure. I also confronted that I saw him on Hinge and he said his friend made him make one, but ive still seen him on it despite ""not having time for a relationship""

He told me he did care and we kind of started talking about nonsense for an hour (literally the most random light things).. then suddenly he started holding me, crying. Then told me I was so perfect in our relationship and didnt do anything wrong and that hed be waiting for me whenever i was ready for friendship. That hed have his schedule ready and hed always be there.

He left and I reached out a few weeks later on Thanksgiving. I reached out because my friend said he started coming around the bar that my friends work at (he lives outside of our city) and was going there during the day, seeming really lonely and trying to get back into our friend's lives. I missed him so much and just sent him a text that I hoped he was doing well, was surrounded by love, and sent him some film photos I had just received of him from the month prior.

No response.

And then tonight, I crashed out and sent him a long text about what he did to me and how his actions have affected me. I know I probably shouldn‚Äôt have but I think I just spent so much of our relationship and breakup trying to help him and taking the blame, that my heartache turned to one last desperate attempt in poorly getting his attention.

Despite all of this, im sad and i miss who i had in the beginning. I miss who I thought was my person. I want him back so badly but know thats never going to happen. I guess I'm here because I know he's not going to respond and I'm never going to get the closure I need from him, but I want to hear from an avoidants perspective.

\- Why did he give his other ex's years of his time and he couldnt handle 4 months with me?  
\- Why did he discard, hold me crying, beg for friendship, then not respond when I reached out?

\- Is this truly avoidant or something else? He seems anxious in other relationships and tried couples therapy with his ""abusive' ex until he lost feelings.

\- How do I cope with being the ""only one"" he has discarded like this?

\- Honestly any insight you can give is helpful. I feel insane and have tried to rationalize this, but it feels like nothing helps me understand what went wrong when he said multiple times that i was only supportive and loving, never asking for too much and being ""perfect"". He has told me its him and not me, but my heart cant cope with the thought that I'm the ""one off"" to him.

I've tried everything from EMDR, weekly therapy, and even talking with a relationship coach that specializes in avoidant attachment... Everyone says I'm not the problem, but I cant help feel blame and confused that I'm the ""one off"" of discards in his life.. How do I truly move on?",1,1737420226.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1i65x7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1i65x7k/interesting_trip_on_zepbound/,Interesting trip on Zepbound ,"I‚Äôm having an interesting experience on my Zepbound. I‚Äôm on week seven and after feeling absolutely horrible for two weeks on 5.0, I went back to 2.5. My primary issue on 5.0 was absolutely horrific heartburn and absolutely no appetite. Back on 2.5 everything just feels more normal. 
I took my shot very early Sunday morning before I flew out to Guatemala. So today is only one day after my shot. Normally when I come here, I just wanna be eating everything because I love to eat when I travel and there are certain foods and cookies here that I love. I come here every year for work. And I normally go to one or two caf√©s every day and have a coffee or mocha. I‚Äôm finding this year that after eating, maybe five or six bites of something that I‚Äôm full. And I don‚Äôt really have the taste for the mocha anymore. And even when I had one, I couldn‚Äôt take more than a few sips before I felt full.
In the past, I would also buy snacks and these typical Guatemalan cookies and bring them back to my hotel and eat them all at night and go out and buy more the next day. Today I bought two cookies from the chocolate museum, I think I took two or three bites of one, I wrapped it back up and put it away for later. I had no desire to finish them. It‚Äôs such a great but unique feeling to not want to always be eating, especially in private. Eating in private was one of my major issues. My appetite is so small. I almost feel a little bit bad because I‚Äôm staying with a family this time because I‚Äôm going to Spanish school for the first week here. And they provide meals and are just the most lovely family. But she gave me what is a large portion for me now and I can‚Äôt eat half of it. Two months ago before I started on Zepbound I would‚Äôve put it away easy and then come back to my room and eat more snacks.
I just wanted to share this observation with other people who might understand. ",2,1737419634.0,Zepbound,4,1.0,False

1i65vj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/1i65vj2/share_yours_what_is_your_watch_collecting_story/,[Share yours] what is YOUR watch collecting story? ,"Hello, 

I'm new to the world of watches and just started to build my humble collection about a year ago. 

I would be grateful to hear some stories of other watch enthusiasts/collectors! 

For example:
- How did you get into the hobby
- What was your first watch purchase
- The most treasured piece in your collection
- Things you learned along the way
- What is still missing in your collection

Every story will be as unique as the collection and the person behind it, so I'm really looking forward to reading them!

To share my story:

I was actually never interested in watches. In my younger years I even had a dislike for jewellery in general.

Some time before my wedding we were talking outfits and I have been asked if I wouldn't want to wear a watch that day. 

Young and uniformed I jumped onto the next available online watch shop and after a short time I ordered a Diesel Mega Chief (I know what you are thinking right now). I have a seven and three quarter inch wrist but it still looked ridiculous, I would learn that later. 

But not before I managed to make another stupid watch mistake: I found an Emporio Armani Chronograph (forgot the model tbh) which was ""on sale"" and at the time I wanted something smaller for every day wear.

So these were my two watch purchases that I regret now as this monstrosity will always be on my wedding photos. 

Fast forward my wife gifted me a 4 slot watch display for Christmas a couple years ago and owning only two watches at the time I felt the need to fill the empty spaces. 

This is where I started to look deeper into the thematic of watches and found the channels of Teddy Baldassarre and others and learned that overpriced fashion watches are a thing.

So I dumped my two watches on ebay and made the decision that if I would  buy another watch it will be one from a more respectable brand. 

Being on a budget at the time (and probably to this day) I fell in love with Japanese watches, especially JDM models, made in Japan. 

The first decent watch I purchased was an Orient Neo 70s Panda Chronograph model WV0041TX. I still love it to this day and it currently sits on a dark brown leather strap.

A couple months later I felt it was time for my first automatic watch. I went with the Seiko Sport 5 SBSA005 (or SRPD55K1). I like the sporty black dial and bezel and the fact that I can wear it with almost everything. The day-date wheel in kanji makes it even more interesting to me. What I didn't like was the strap, especially the clasp and the hallow endlinks. Currently it's on a olive green canvas strap which makes it really comfortable to wear.

In between I picked up a cheap Casio W219H and a G-Shock GA-2000S. I still own these, planning to sell the G-Shock and keep the Casio as a first beater watch for one of my kids. 

A couple weeks ago I imported yet another JDM watch: A G-Shock GW-5000U-1JF, it's my the watch I wear for work. It can apparently handle everything, has Multi Band 6 and Tough Solar. I just grab it in the morning and run out the door without having to worry about anything. The DLC coated screwback case back and upgraded rubber strap over the hard resin on cheaper G-Shocks are giving the watch a great weight and more luxurious feel. Probably the watch I love the most so far.

My next purchase will most likely be a Citizen NB1050-59H for more formal occasions like church meetings and coffee dates with my wife. 

Oh and I own a Citizen Chandler AW0050-82E which I will be gifting to my dad later this year. 

Looking into the future I'm planning to hold myself back a bit more and put enough money to the side to hopefully one day be able to justify a purchase of a Longines Hydroconquest or a Tudor Black Bay. I'm not yet sure if I will ever be willing to spend that kind of money on a watch, but we'll see.

1i65uyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1i65uyp/is_this_a_fair_price_for_whats_being_offered/,Is this a fair price for what's being offered?,"I'm just starting wedding planning and have been looking around at some venues in upstate SC where we live. My partner and I found a restaurant that hosts weddings (ceremony & reception) that is already decorated with lots of plants/miscellaneous items we could use if interested. Although we haven't eaten there (yet) the food seems pretty upscale/steakhouse vibes. We're planning for about 70 guests. The total price quoted is about **$12,500 total AFTER tax/service fees** ($3k venue fee and $5k F&B min breakdown). What's included is below:

* Venue Access 9am-10pm
* Two (2) getting ready suites with complimentary lite lunch
* Ceremony space / chairs
* Garden room where the food will be placed / cocktail hour
* Farm tables & walnut chairs in reception area
* China, glassware, silverware, chargers
* String lights around the area, Chandeliers, Fireplace, and option to use in-house decor that is already in the restaurant
* Buffet for 70 people included (3 hor d'oeurves, 1 salad, 2 entrees *with carving station,* 3 sides) = comes out to about $60 per head
* Dessert for an additional $ cost, or can bring in our own dessert
* Beer & Wine package included - 4 beers/4 wines, soft drinks, coffee = comes out to about $30 per head for 3 hours
* Bartenders/servers included
* Onsite wedding planner additional $ cost.. still waiting on how much extra that would be

I feel like it's a good price but I kinda just need someone to convince me it's worth it. I'm trying not to spend $$$ for this wedding so I'm hoping if all of this is included it will cut down on stress/cost of finding othering catering options. Other venues we've searched have a little bit of a higher venue fee but then I could probably find cheaper catering options.. but then would have to spend more on decor. Then would mean more vendors to coordinate.

So yeah... my brain hurts. Is this a good price for all that's offered?",1,1737419464.0,weddingplanning,2,1.0,False

1i65tkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1i65tkb/why_all_the_wellintentioned_making_friends_advice/,"Why all the well-intentioned 'making friends' advice misses the mark, and a possible solution","Every week, the AskSF and sanfrancisco subs get about 10 different variations of the ""I'm new here, 25-40 M/F, how do I make friends?"" question. And every week, well-intentioned folks reply with 10 different variations of the same answer:

* ""Find other people with similar interests""

* ""Join groups based on your interests""

* ""Have you tried facebook/meetup/xyz site to look for groups that do things that you like?""

* ""What are your hobbies? There's xyz group that meets every Wed!""

Despite people asking the same question every week, and people giving similar answers every week, it still seems like a tonne of people have this issue.

My hypothesis is that it's good advice pretty much everywhere else, but unfortunately misses the mark in SF for a simple reason. Consider the following: most people asking this are transplants who have done well in school, are hardworking and career focused, and moving to SF/bay area for their tech job. However, SF is now full of transplants who are very career focused and lacking in good social skills, or even the motivation to meet new people and make new friends as many are very introverted. The people who already have solid friend groups are either bay area natives, or came to the bay for college or grad school and established their friend groups there. They are not super interested in meeting new people.

The main issue with the advice people give is that a lot of people in SF take their hobbies/interests VERY seriously because their lives are basically work + 1 serious hobby and nothing else really. Meeting people through hobby/activity focused groups is a good way to make initial contact, but unless you are planning to be very dedicated to this activity, it will be difficult to make friends. 

I suspect that the people asking how to make friends are really asking how to make 'general' friends - they want a group they can hang out with to watch a movie, see the game, go out drinking, play pickleball sometimes, etc. They are not looking for friends that are task specific and you only see them in a specific context. And that is why the advice doesn't really work. 

Obviously I'm not claiming this is an issue 100% of the time, but often enough that it doesn't really lead to lasting friendships for the majority of the people. 

So what's the solution? I'm not sure there is an easy solution, but it could involve looking for groups/meetups that are the exact opposite - that is, groups that are just meeting up for socialization/fun, not for specific activities where there is a skill hierarchy and people are super serious about it. Maybe one of us could start such a group and plan a rotation of low pressure fun activities like chilling in a park, grabbing a coffee or a drink somewhere cool, going to a game, etc. and make it more neighborhood specific so it's easier for the same people to show up. 

Feel free to tell me I'm wrong but also suggest an alternative hypothesis if you do!",7,1737419364.0,sanfrancisco,3,0.68,False

Wellbutrin is 150mg daily. I was on 300 at one point but went down. Not sure if that was the right decision as I‚Äôm having difficulty focusing the past few months. I‚Äôve decided to remove my 1 coffee in the am to see if that helps.

I buy a large (three or four shot) iced latte almost every day of the year. I was originally attracted to the ease of a Nespresso machine, but after reading, I am considering using beans and putting slightly more effort into things. 

These are my general goals/thoughts in order of importance which I am realizing may be difficult:
1. Ability to make six or eight shots quickly so that I can make two large iced lattes or shaken espressos. 
2.  I really want it to taste much closer to a four shot iced latte I would buy at a coffee shop than higher end grocery store cold brew mixed with higher end grocery store sweet cream. 
3. I do not want to put a lot of thought or creativity into what I am doing, although generally I do have attention to detail in the kitchen. I am not interested in the academics of coffee. I just want to make solid iced lattes. 
4. I would like a machine that is not too difficult to clean. I will clean often as I am a bit of a germaphobe. 
5.  I would love if it was an all in one machine, but I am open to grinding beans separately if my goals can‚Äôt be met with an all in one. 

I am unsure of budget. I am ok spending more for ease and getting what I want, but do not want to  spend more to have the best technology or better ability to customize or be creative - as I do not want to be creative. I will commit to use filtered water and expensive beans, and to clean as needed.

We met up at a coffee shop and I treated her as I always do on my first dates we sat in and chatted for a maybe nearly hour about 20 mins into the date she told me she was autistic and went on to say when she has mentioned it to people in the past it has put them off her.

I have always been a kind caring person and dont judge anyone and think that she also is very kind caring and lovely after she told me she was autistic I said aww ok thankyou for telling me I don't judge anyone and that's just you and i like you for who you are i genuinely ment it aswell after a bit more chatting in the coffee shop we then went out for a walk round the town we got on great 

As we where about to go outside she offers (puts her hand out) and asks if we can hold hands I thought this was very lovely and I agreed even if I was a bit shocked it felt very nice I'm not sure if her being autistic has anything to do with her offering to hold hands 

I honeslty really do like her alot even after date 1 and we have a 2nd date planned I obviously do not know how bad her autism is if it's very slight or more serious I dont really intend to bring this up a subject as I bet shes heard it alot but I'd like some idea so I can be my best for her and not do anything wrong this will not change my opinion of her but I'd like to continue to make her happy and enjoy being with me 

Is there anyone that could give me a idea of for example if autistic people feel love differently or would not want to do certain things kiss for example I've had people in the past give me some sort of sign to go in for a kiss when I felt the moment was right, will this be the case with her as I'd love to of course but really dont want to mess it up or know if she would even show a hint or something that she wants me to is it different?

1i65pvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1i65pvu/breville_dual_wallpressurized_basket_compatible/,Breville dual wall/pressurized basket compatible with Gaggia Classic E24 ?,"Hi guys!

Have any of you guys tried to use a 58mm Breville branded pressurized (dual wall) basket on the stock portafilter of the Gaggia Classic E24 ? For example, something like the 58mm Breville SP0001757 [https://www.breville.com/ca/en/parts-accessories/parts/sp0001757.html](https://www.breville.com/ca/en/parts-accessories/parts/sp0001757.html) ?

  
I'm asking because I dislike the stock pressuried basket that comes with the Gaggia for 2 main reasons: 

1. I feel the coffee comes out way too fast, even if I ask the local caf√© to grind at the finest ""turkish coffee"" setting and use a full basket before tamping.
2. I dislike that hot water passes through the piece of plastic thingy before I drink my cup. I'd like to limit the microplastics I absorb. Also, I dislike having to use that piece of plastic. It's a pain to clean and if I lose it, the pressurized basket is useless.

Alternatively, did you successfully use other ""metal only"" pressurized baskets with the Gaggia ?

Normally, I use fresh beans with my Eureka grinder and the ""regular"" double basket.

I'm looking to use a pressurized basket to occasionnaly make decaf coffees...

I want to ideally be able to get to Chicago within under 40 minutes if possible. Great medical care (dentists, doctors, pediatric doctors, nursing/rehab centers) is essential within 25 min. We‚Äôre moving from an area in the south that had horrid schools and medical care and we need an upgrade in a major way. For bigger things (like surgery etc) we are willing to drive into Chicago. Price point is houses under 650$ if possible. 

We have a child so moving into an apartment to feel out the area for a year is the tentative plan but we want to get stable asap for school and him making friends. My son will need good surgeons in the city since he‚Äôs due for two more surgeries when he‚Äôs older. I also have a mom who had a stroke and will need ongoing rehabilitative care. Hopefully we buy a house as soon as possible if we like it. Subway access close by would be great but isn‚Äôt necessity.

Does this magical place exist? How much higher do we need to go on price for a good area? If not that close, anything further away that has these amenities and we can drive into the city within an hour?

1i65nsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1i65nsj/dance_floor_rules/,Dance floor rules,"I am an introvert and my husband knows about this. However, I tangibly challenge myself every time that there is an opportunity. Sadly, I don‚Äôt think my husband can see that. 

The other night, our friend invited us to his DJ set and get some clubbing going on. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable dancing in the crowd for the most part because my anxiety gets ahead of me. To add, my husband wants to look like a couple on the dance floor. His way of doing this, in my own understanding, is through a little bit of humping with swaying, hugging passionately or kissing in public without care. I as an introvert see that as an extra task that I have to accomplish in a clubbing night to add in ‚Äúdancing in the public‚Äù task. Is it wrong to feel and to just dance however minimal I want to as long as I‚Äôm having fun with the music and hold my husbands hands while im doing so? For me, it‚Äôs already a compromise. Because a. i‚Äôm a socially awkward person and Im still out here supporting our friend and trying to have fun with my husband and b. it‚Äôs not a culture that I grew up in (im not from the US) Additionally, there‚Äôs new people that I was introduced to last night and that‚Äôs another thing that goes into my anxious tiny brain. I tried my very best to just dance and have fun that night. I went through a process of getting nervous at all time high to loosening up. But, by the time that I loosened up he told me to come closer and why am I so far away. When I was just a forearm far away from him. My body is still facing him and I wasn‚Äôt dancing with other guys. Meanwhile, the other couple that we met that night were just freely dancing in their own ways. Especially the other female because it seemed like the dance floor were too small for her. I commend her for that and I commend her boyfriend for just letting her let loose. I on the other hand was just occupying the space that I designated myself and didn‚Äôt dance with other people. I was just next to him all the time and just focused on supporting our friend too. Then still he whispered to me, ‚Äúlet loose. Dont think about other people.‚Äù and as an introvert, saying those things doesnt really help. Because now youre judging the way I dance and youre proving a point as to why I am so conscious of myself. I also thought that he was just saying that for his own benefit and I was making him uncomfortable. 

Again, I communicated this concern to him a day after it happened. And I appreciated it that he gave me space last night to vent it out to him and zipped his mouth through the entire process. I had a genuine feeling of validation from what he did because I was so scared that he would defend his actions again. However, this morning I was dumbfounded to find out that he was upset about the party as well. Because, I didn‚Äôt dance ‚Äòaccordingly‚Äô to him and once in a while he wanted people to see that we are a couple instead of just friends dancing together. He also mentioned that he is jealous about the other couple that night. Which reminds me of the face that he made that night. I chose to forget that face because sometimes when youre married, you just choose to forget. But I remember when he whispered to me to let loose and I whispered back that please dont tell me that right now, im really trying. He answered me with a scowled face and he was in a bad mood for the rest of the night. And so does in this moment, he is telling to me that he is equally upset and I didn‚Äôt utter a word throughout his piece even though I was hurt. I am seriously fucked with my anxiety problems because it is affecting our marriage like this too. Yet, I also feel betrayed because I did not lack in communication regarding my social anxiety issues to him. 

I didn‚Äôt know what else to say. So, I just stonewalled him for the first time. I was going to the coffee shop today anyways and he knew that. I left without saying a word and then proceeded to text me that I left without saying goodbye.

I know I was wrong for doing that. But, I feel like standing on my ground for not saying anything and only sharing screenshots from the internet. Similar sentiments from my co introvert people who feel forced to dance. He got more upset and said that why I cant just be sorry and not push back just like how I wanted it last night when I was venting to him. 

Am I wrong for making him understand? Am I wrong for not backing up because I don‚Äôt feel validated and understood. And am I wrong for just shutting down because I know that I made the effort for that night out. such as continued dancing and held his hands and looked into his eyes while dancing. I thought, he doesnt see those efforts. It‚Äôs already hard to be socially anxious but I know in myself when I am trying not to be. It just hurts when I am already trying but it‚Äôs not enough for my partner. And publicly make a scowl face when there‚Äôs a potential that other people can see it.

I left the house to be by myself right now. He demands me to say sorry to him because I didn‚Äôt give him the space to be upset because I talked back with my screenshots. So what do I do now when I get back? ",1,1737418916.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

She then begins screaming, started smashing the plate she was using and throwing utensils everywhere.

# THE SHORT VERSION:

¬†I‚Äôm trying to track someone down using their ExtraCare Card #. They committed a crime against me and stole something incredibly personal and sentimental to me‚Äîsomething I can‚Äôt just replace.

# FULL STORY:

Yesterday, I got a fraud alert from my bank (CHASE) about a $300 charge that was initially declined but went through on a second attempt. Before that, the same card was used to make a $91.11 purchase just minutes earlier. After contacting my bank, I learned the charges were made at a nearby CVS. 

I immediately called that CVS and later went there in person. A CVS employee gave me a vague description of the woman and the receipts for the transactions. She spent the $300 on Target gift cards and the $91.11 on random personal items. Unfortunately, they couldn‚Äôt show me the surveillance footage. 

I thought my wallet was safe on my coffee table when I went to bed, and nothing else seemed out of place in my home. A break-in didn‚Äôt make sense to me. But when I got back from CVS, I noticed my neighbor across the hall has a Ring door camera pointing directly to my front door. I went over explaining my situaton and asked if it had picked anything up. chilling, it had. Sure enough, it caught a woman matching CVS's description entering my home at 8:30 AM.

It felt like my stomach dropped. But at the same time, I was relieved‚ÄîI finally had proof.

Yes she just walked in using the front door. My door was unlocked because I had a guest staying over who left for work around 7 AM and forgot to lock it behind them.

Based on the footage, she was only inside for about five minutes. It‚Äôs hard to say what her original intent was‚Äîmaybe she thought the house was empty and panicked when she heard noise from my room or my brother‚Äôs room (we were both awake). Either way, she grabbed my wallet on the way out.

I don‚Äôt care about the cash or cards‚Äîthose can be replaced. But there‚Äôs something deeply personal in my wallet that means the world to me. I‚Äôm devastated at the thought of it being gone, but I have to try everything within my power to get it back.

# Here‚Äôs where I need  help:

On the CVS receipt, her ExtraCare Card was used, and the last four digits of her account number are visible. Funny to think¬†even though she was using my money, she instinctively concerned herself with receiving a good bang for her buck. My hope is that someone here knows how to look up the full account number, so I can provide this information to the police.

I know it‚Äôs a long shot. I also realize the card may not even be registered to her. But something tells me she isn‚Äôt the sharpest‚ÄîI mean, who walks into a house with a Ring camera staring right at them? 

Please know that my intention isn‚Äôt to confront or retaliate against this person. I just want to help the police move quickly and, hopefully, recover what she took before it‚Äôs gone for good.

If you‚Äôve made it this far, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I appreciate your time and any advice or help you can offer. If you‚Äôre someone who knows how to access ExtraCare account info, please DM me. I can also provide the evidence for proof of context. I‚Äôll handle the rest with the authorities.

I used it for an average of 1 drink a day for 7 weeks (we weren‚Äôt even home for 1 week because we were visiting family), when it promptly stopped grinding. More precisely, it started making a horrible sound and no grounds were being produced. So we disassemble and clean the whole grinder using the instruction video and put the beans back in, and it grinds for 2 seconds before making the same terrible sound and producing nothing. We ended up cleaning it 3 times between us, and it still wouldn‚Äôt work. 

Then I call customer service, who makes me do it again with them supervising on a video call which I, in pjs and recovering from the flu, was not prepared for. Nevertheless, *shocker!* after this very pleasant customer service agent watches me do what I told her I‚Äôd already done several times, it still makes the horrible sound and won‚Äôt grind one damn bean.

Has anyone else had this or similar issues? I‚Äôd love for it to be this simple, but I‚Äôm dubious of the replacement burr fixing the issue since the other one looks fine and is so new.

1i65ag1,https://i.redd.it/tznzk6uhn8ee1.jpeg,This might not be a good fit for me [DeLonghi ECP3630],"I got this DeLonghi ECP3630 last Christmas and it‚Äôs been making me fantastic espresso/lattes for a year now. I never bothered to weigh my coffee, and only somewhat made sure my grounds were ‚Äúfine‚Äù with the pictured grinder. I used the scoop/tamp and the pressurized basket that came with the machine (pictured left, black), just one scoop per shot. I‚Äôd fill up the espresso cup to a level that I had seen baristas do and called it good, ~20 seconds. Even without any ‚Äúdialing in‚Äù my workflow, my wife and I loved the espresso and lattes we got. 

Recently, I wanted to upgrade my experience (i.e., I wanted to make latte art) so I followed a guide and replaced my steam wand with a Rancillio wand, got a bottomless portafilter, WDT, and weighted tamper (pictured right). It all arrived today, so I decided to give it a go and my experience has been eye-opening. First I just used a single scoop in the new portafilter, and the shot pulled in about 5 seconds w/ no crema. 2 scoops and a harder tamp, pulled in ~12 seconds w/ no crema. Then I finally listened to several guides, weighed out 17g, put on the finest grind, tamped hard and pulled 35g in ~25 seconds, and it had good crema. 

This prompted me to weigh out my previous workflow with the pressurized basket. Turns out for the past year I‚Äôve been using ~6g of (not very finely ground) beans to pull a ~55-60g shot‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve been loving it. The caffeine level of my previous shots was a little high for my low tolerances, but the flavor was good. I would like to keep using my new basket, but I‚Äôm worried about the caffeine level. My gut tells me that 17g with the new tools instead of the 6g I was doing with my old basket will give me way too much caffeine. I tried just 6g of finely ground beans with a hard tamp in the new bottomless basket but it poured out way too fast with no crema. 

Is the caffeine level of the new 17g -> 35g shot comparable to that of my old 6g -> 60g shot? Am I destined to pull weak/watery shots with a lame pressurized basket for the rest of my life? Should I get a grinder that can go EVEN FINER to try my 6g shot in the new basket?",2,1737417920.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

Almost 2 weeks ago I had a 2-day bout of the... opposite of constipation due to severe nerves about an upcoming flight. I was nice and cleaned out after that, LOL. 

But since reaching my destination, I've had the longest and worst bout of constipation I've ever had. It's like my body has totally forgotten how to go on its own. I've had to eat tiny amounts of food and/or stick to liquids because I'm so backed up, and absolutely NOTHING I try to take orally is working at ALL. I've tried every laxative, senna, prune juice, fiber, coffee... EVERYTHING I can think to try. I had to go to the ER last week because the pain in my midsection was so bad. CT scan showed nothing wrong except that I'm badly constipated. Even the lactulose they gave me did nothing. 

The only thing that has worked whatsoever is enemas. I've had to do 5 of them in the past week, one per day. I've mainly done the saline ones and a couple bisacodyl Fleet enemas. But I've heard that your body can become dependent on enemas so using them this much is scaring me. 

I have to call my doctor's office tomorrow and see if I can get a telehealth appointment. I'm out of state for a couple months helping out a family member and my health insurance doesn't cover anything but emergency care outside my home state, so I can't see a GI here. 

Does anyone know how long it's safe to use enemas? Any other advice would be greatly appreciated. ",1,1737417906.0,ConstipationAdvice,1,1.0,False

The boredom is your mind rewiring itself from the unnatural, quick & easy source of dopamine that video games once provided.

Soon normal things will start to feel more pleasurable.

I'm almost 1 month clean now from gaming (and weed) and I'm starting to feel high off life.

Red flags:
- always been obsessed with numbers and letters 
- he isn‚Äôt speech delayed (I don‚Äôt think) as he can communicate his needs and wants for the most part, but we are unable to hold a conversation fluently back and forth. He is most often information seeking ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs this, what‚Äôs that, what‚Äôs x doing, what‚Äôs that sign say‚Äù etc. 
- he is quite hyper and sometimes runs around the kitchen island or coffee table repeatedly. Is this Stimming?? 
- sometimes flaps hands when frustrated or excited 
- he goes to daycare and I‚Äôve never been told he has social problems but often had hard times sharing. At the park and at weekend activities he is very shy and sometimes can be a loner. You can tell he‚Äôs very anxious 
- sometimes it seems he doesn‚Äôt understand consequences 
- potty training is going terribly 

More neurotypical behavior:
- makes eye contact  
- has empathy (ex points out if I‚Äôm hurt, asks why his sister is sad if she‚Äôs crying)
- plays with toys creatively (cars on a track, plays doctor, serves ice cream from his ice cream truck, feeds baby etc) 
- not speech delayed in terms of being able to communicate his needs. He is also bilingual so maybe contributes to my speech concern above 
- points out things he sees
- very easy going in terms of routine 
- no sensory issues with clothes or foods 
- fine with loud noises and overstimulating situations (ex birthday parties, Disneyland)

Luna VI query: Set the source to the leaked files of the first reconnaissance operation of Irisa.

Done!

Luna VI query: How did Nathan do in the hearing?

\***

On the private waiting room connecting to the hotel's conference center, Nathan adjusted his stance, staring down at the crisp white shirt stretched over his chest.

His father, standing in front of him, worked the knot of the tie with ease. The silk looped and folded in a sequence Nathan had never quite managed to master, despite his many attempts over the years. He blamed his lifestyle‚Äîyears spent trekking through jungles, scaling cliffs, and wading through marshes to study plants didn‚Äôt leave much room for mastering formalwear. He felt a mild itch beneath the stiff fabric of the shirt collar, a discomfort that seemed to amplify the anxiety for the scrutiny he would face during the hearing.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not too tight, is it?‚Äù his father asked, stepping back to assess his work. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt do any good if you can‚Äôt talk when the GU officials question you.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs fine,‚Äù Nathan said, though he resisted the urge to tug at the knot. The tie felt like a leash, a fitting metaphor for the hearing ahead.

Nathan‚Äôs mother, observed the scene from her chair with her arms crossed, a figure with black hair and a faint smile tugging at her lips. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pity Amara couldn‚Äôt help with that tie,‚Äù she remarked. ‚ÄúI've always been so good at helping your father whenever he needed one.‚Äù

Nathan looked up, his eyes first settling on his mother, and then on Amara, seated beside her. Without the blue leaves from Irisa, Amara's blue stood in strong contrast to her surroundings, her soft skin subtly hiding her true mood. Her ears poked cutely from the middle of her hair strands, softening the seriousness of her formal attire‚Äîa tailored blazer that gave her a somewhat businesslike appearance.

Nathan was certain the flawless presentation was thanks to Mia‚Äôs guidance, though she had stepped out for coffee just moments ago.

Amara caught his gaze and hints of yellow appeared on her neck, her sharp, clawed fingers folded neatly in her lap. Her expression was calm after Emily's comment, with even a flicker of amusement in her eyes. Nathan smiled a her, wordlessly assuring her that his mother‚Äôs comments were nothing to take personally. At least, not anymore. Emily‚Äôs bluntness had softened considerably since their first meeting, though traces of her sharp tongue remained.

‚ÄúI will not bother learning,‚Äù Amara said lightly, gesturing to the tie with the tip of her tail. ‚ÄúNathan will never need one once we return to Irisa.‚Äù

Emily‚Äôs expression darkened slightly, her disapproval evident. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all well and good, but he‚Äôll need one here,‚Äù she said firmly. ‚ÄúFor his wedding with you, for one.‚Äù

Nathan tensed slightly, but Amara simply listened.

Emily continued, her tone growing more resolute. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just take Nat to your planet and cut him off from Earth. He has two sets of grandparents still alive, not to mention uncles and aunts. They‚Äôll want to see him and your son. You‚Äôll need to spend at least a month here every year. Non-negotiable.‚Äù

Amara straightened her posture, her voice taking on a regal tone. ‚ÄúI have plans to bring many humans to Irisa to ensure Argor will not grow up alone.‚Äù she said, folding her hands elegantly. ‚ÄúBut bringing him to Earth every year to play with human children sounds like an excellent idea.‚Äù

Emily blinked, caught off guard by the easy concession. Her eyes moved briefly to Nathan, then to his father, Noah, as if seeking confirmation that they had heard the same thing. Nathan and Noah exchanged a knowing glance, but Emily recovered faster than they could say anything, leaned forward slightly in her chair.

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs settled, then,‚Äù she said briskly. ‚ÄúNow, when do I get to see the baby? The news keeps going on about Argor this and Argor that, but I haven‚Äôt seen so much as a picture.‚Äù

Noah chuckled awkwardly and pressed a hand to Nathan‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been waiting for this moment, you know,‚Äù he said, then addressed Amara directly. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to hold back the pictures. Em‚Äôs prepared to accept that her grandson has a tail.‚Äù

Nathan laughed at his father's wrong assumption, deliberately choosing to stay silent, knowing Amara could handle the situation. He leaned back slightly, giving her the space to engage with his parents without his interference. Amara‚Äôs skin changed tones, a subtle white hue appearing along the sides of her neck‚Äîprove she wasn't actively hiding her embarrassment. But she also recovered quickly, her voice steady as she replied, ‚ÄúArgor does not have a tail. But I do have many pictures of him I can share.‚Äù

Emily‚Äôs interest was instant, her eyes lighting up as she glanced at Noah. The look they exchanged poorly concealed the intensity of their curiosity. Nathan, however, wasn‚Äôt worried. Without claws or a tail, Argor‚Äôs appearance leaned closer to that of a regular human baby‚Äîat least if one ignored the way his skin often shifted colors like his mother‚Äôs.

‚ÄúNathan showed me how to use my translator to share images,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúI can add you both to my contacts so you can see Argor.‚Äù

Moments later, both Emily and Noah were huddled beside Amara, and the very first image  elicited a delighted gasp from Emily. ‚ÄúHe has Nathan‚Äôs eyes!‚Äù

This was followed by a series of questions, culminating in Amara explaining that it would still take a day for Argo to reach Earth so they could see him in person.

Overwhelmed by the sudden attention, Amara‚Äôs explanation of the pictures grew more detailed, her composure slowly giving way to an enthusiastic narratives. In her excitement, she forgot to add Nathan to the virtual space, leaving him as an observer to the growing spiral of questions his parents directed solely at her.

Nathan watched with amusement, knowing where this would lead. Sooner or later, they‚Äôd grow bold enough to ask that question, and Amara would likely end up with the burden of explaining the details of what made possible for an human and Irisian hybrid to be born. He decided not to intervene‚Äîit was a conversation he was glad to be excluded from.

Instead, Nathan‚Äôs thoughts drifted to the upcoming hearing. There, he would face both the elected members of the GU and department heads, and their merciless questions about his breach of contract and his role in the Irisa exploratory mission.

The prospect of having to justify his actions was scary, but he couldn‚Äôt help but smile, unsure whether to be proud or ashamed. After all, how would he explain that, instead of bringing back plant samples, he had returned with a kid and the Irisian queen as his wife?

As these conflicting emotions swirled in his mind‚Äîfear for the hearing, happiness at how smoothly Amara‚Äôs introduction to his parents was going‚Äîthe time slipped by unnoticed. A knock at the door brought him back to the present. Nathan crossed the room and opened it to find one of the hotel staff robots standing there. Its large, gentle eyes blinked up at him, projecting a calm demeanor.

‚ÄúThe hearing will begin now,‚Äù the robot said in a smooth, mechanical voice. ‚ÄúIt will be conducted in virtual space at the conference center. Only a few investigators will be physically present.‚Äù

Nathan nodded, a small pit forming in his stomach. That sounded about right. The GU wouldn‚Äôt physically gather their entire team in one place just to address his transgression, and he was certain they had brought the investigators along just in case he slipped up or did something stupid, giving them a reason to justify an arrest. The robot lingered for a brief moment, as if ensuring he understood, then turned and left.

When he closed the door and turned back to the room, all eyes were on him. His parents were watching with concern, while Amara sat composed and calm. Her reassuring expression radiated a quiet strength, the kind of presence that came from someone who had already endured far more than most people ever would.

Emily approached him first, her hands on her hips. ‚ÄúBe careful with what you say. You know how they twist things.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, Mom,‚Äù Nathan replied softly, offering a small smile to ease her concern.

Noah stepped up beside her, placing a hand on Nathan‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúStay sharp.‚Äù

""Will do,"" he replied.

He was about to turn toward the door when Amara‚Äôs voice stopped him.

""Do not dare to make a mistake, but if you do, know that I will save you when my turn to speak on behalf of Irisa arrive,‚Äù she said.

Nathan‚Äôs parents exchanged confused glances, clearly unsure what to make of the statement. Emily opened her mouth as if to question her, but Nathan raised a hand to forestall it. He knew Amara was serious. She wasn‚Äôt one to make empty promises.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hope it doesn‚Äôt come to that,‚Äù he said with a light smile.

With a final glance around the room, he turned and walked out the door, heading for the conference center just a short distance away.

The place was plain, almost disappointingly unremarkable‚Äîbeige walls, a long table in the center, and an absence of personal touches or decor. It looked like any corporate meeting room hastily assembled for an impersonal function.

As he moved further inside, a small, translucent window popped up in front of his eyes, projected by the integrated system. The message was simple:

""Join Virtual Meeting?""

Nathan glanced around the room. On the far side, a few men in suits stood silently with their stern faces giving him the distinct impression they were the investigators. Their eyes briefly landed on him, and he swallowed hard, forcing himself to look away.

Forget they‚Äôre here. Focus.

Taking a deep breath, he selected 'Yes' on the hovering interface with mental comand. Instantly, the room around him began to shift as the augmented space expanded reality. The plain walls and table dissolved into a holographic overlay, replaced by an imposing encirclement of grand tables.

They stretched high and wide, their design seeming to dwarf him. Formally dressed individuals materialized around the tables, seated stiffly with a air of authority. Their clothing was formal, but some of them looked more sloppy than the others, as if to them this was just another day of work.

As he scanned their faces, his first impression was of age. Most of the them appeared older than him, though he couldn‚Äôt be certain‚Äîrejuvenating technologies had made age almost meaningless across humanity. Even the few who might have been close to his age carried an air of detached superiority that made him feel like an outsider.

His eyes shifted toward a group of floating windows hovering mid-air. Sally, one of the senior members of the GU Security Department, was among them, her pink glasses unmistakable even in there. A few other department heads also appeared this way. Their lack of physical avatars was perhaps deliberate, and Nathan immediately suspected it was some precaution against tech vulnerabilities that came with full immersion systems, especially ones integrated into the nervous system.

Before he could dwell on it, an old man he didn‚Äôt recognize spoke, his voice drawing all eyes toward him.

‚ÄúThis hearing has been convened to investigate multiple reported cases of misconduct by Nathan Everett while representing Earth in the exploration of the previously Alliance-affiliated world of Irisa,‚Äù the man announced from his seat. ‚ÄúMr. Everett has been accused of neglecting his duties during the mission period, including demanding an early return to Earth prior to the completion of the one-year agreement. Furthermore, there are allegations of intentionally breaching the terms of his non-disclosure agreement and leaking sensitive information to the press.‚Äù

Nathan felt a flare of indignation rising in his chest. The accusations were skewed, and blatantly misrepresented the circumstances of the mission. He wanted to speak, to correct the record right then and there. But his lawyer‚Äôs warnings were clear: only speak when requested and don‚Äôt let emotions take over.

As the focal point of their scrutiny, his resisted the urge to correct them as the hearing began. Formalities were quick, just the expected request that he swear to speak only the truth. He complied, knowing it was more symbolic than binding in a setting like this. Then they moved to the circumstances of his mission. The announcer reviewed his selection as Earth‚Äôs representative to Irisa, chosen because of his unique combination of skills‚Äîa botanist with extensive wilderness experience and a minor in international studies.

Eventually, the first sharp question directed at him came from an older woman seated at one of the most prominent tables. She was introduced as an elected member.

‚ÄúMr. Everett,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúdo you confirm your close relationship with the Irisian queen? If so, how do you explain falling for what appears to be a blatant baby trap? The mission records say you were warned by Colonel Vega about the Irisians‚Äô intentions before you even set foot on Irisa.‚Äù

Nathan froze for a moment, immediately recognizing the malice embedded in her words. The question was a trap. If he denied his relationship with Amara, he‚Äôd be framed as a liar. If he admitted it, it would cast him as gullible, someone who ignored warnings and became a tool in what they were implying was a calculated ploy by Amara, who at the time couldn't possibly know that baby trapping was even a possibility.

After a brief pause to consider how not to incriminate himself, he spoke. ‚ÄúYes, I confirm my close relationship with Amara, and I do so without shame. But let me clarify something: Amara wasn‚Äôt trying to seduce me at the beginning. We grew closer gradually during the time we were lost in the Ebon Range. Mission control failed to detect that my communication equipment had been destroyed, and Amara and I were left to fend for ourselves against an entire army of Irisians. If there‚Äôs any blame to assign, it should be to mission control for that oversight.‚Äù

The exchange of surprised glances across the tables satisfied Nathan, though a twinge of remorse surfaced for having to implicate mission control, knowing Mia had been part of that team.

The next question came from a man introduced as an elected representative of the GU, Mr. Havers, whose sour face alone made it clear he would say something harsh. ‚ÄúMr. Everett, do you not feel any shame? You involved yourself romantically with a non-human alien. How do you justify that morally?‚Äù

The atmosphere in the room shifted entirely. The question was clearly divisive, even among the formal suits surrounding him. Nathan took a moment to look around, gauging the tension. Surprisingly, this felt easier to answer.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by morality?‚Äù Nathan asked evenly. ‚ÄúAmara and I were both single when we met, and last I checked, humanity had long since moved past forbidding what people do in private. Our relationship is pretty normal if you look past the differences in species. Honestly, I think if morality were such a massive concern, you‚Äôd find much more questionable things happening right here on Earth.‚Äù

The response stirred some debate, but Nathan could feel it‚Äîhe had won this round.

When order was restored, the same woman from before returned with a curveball. ‚ÄúMorality aside,‚Äù she said coolly, ‚Äúwhat I want to know, Mr. Everett, is why you broke your NDA and went public with private mission files. Sally‚Äôs presence here proves the GU was assisting with the rescue of the hybrid. To me, it seems like you leaked those files to manipulate public opinion against the GU.‚Äù

Nathan‚Äôs mind raced. This was a tough one. Denying it outright, as his lawyer advised, might raise more suspicion. Shifting blame to the Department of Defense might sour alliances Amara couldn‚Äôt afford to lose.

He took a breath, choosing neither path. ‚ÄúWhen Argor was kidnapped, I almost went crazy,‚Äù he admitted, his voice raw. ‚ÄúIt was one of the hardest times in my life‚Äîfor both Amara and me. It nearly tore us apart. So, I ask you this: What would you have done if it were your child who had been taken?‚Äù

He looked each of them in the eye as he spoke, letting the weight of his question sink in. Realizing he might unleash some pent-up anger if he continued, he stopped there.

This gave an opening for an older man, who had remained silent until now, to question Nathan as well. ‚ÄúWe understand it might have been difficult, Mr. Everett, but did you not consider the consequences of your actions? Undermining public trust in the GU during a time of heightened tensions with the Alliance was reckless.‚Äù

Nathan noticed subtle nods of agreement around the table. His pulse quickened. But before he could respond, Sally‚Äôs voice cut through the virtual avatars, her appearance the same as always‚Äìan old lady in floating screen who even now seemed to be double tasking.

‚ÄúThat may be true, sweetheart‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbut during the rescue of the hybrid, our Defense Department uncovered an underground facility. What we found there will make Mr. Everett‚Äôs actions irrelevant when it reaches the public.‚Äù

Her voice grew chilling as she added, ‚ÄúI suggest we adjourn for today. There‚Äôs no point in continuing this line of questioning when Amara herself will address your concerns tomorrow as the representative of her people. There are far more pressing issues we need to discuss with her.‚Äù

Her gaze flicked to Nathan briefly, as if to remind him she had just saved his skin, before shifting to a dissatisfied representative pressing her for details about the facility and the rescue. Sally dismissed their concerns with a pointed response, making it clear that her clearance outweighed theirs.

Nathan couldn't help but smile, knowing he knew something all those powerful people didn't just because of his unusual wife.

After a brief exchange among the panel, the hearing was adjourned. The augmented space dissolved around Nathan, returning him to the empty conference room. The investigators across the room still stared at him, their expressions unreadable. But, thankfully, none of them seemed inclined to arrest him just yet.

Nathan turned back to find his parents waiting anxiously by the wall. His brow furrowed as he realized Amara wasn‚Äôt there, an odd absence considering the hearing also involved her. Approaching them, he simply asked, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Amara?‚Äù

Emily hesitated, her lips pressing tightly together. Noah gave her a knowing look and said softly, ‚ÄúEm.‚Äù

Finally, Emily met Nathan‚Äôs gaze and spoke. ‚ÄúSamantha just arrived at the hotel. Amara and Mia went to meet her.‚Äù

A single word escaped from Nathan‚Äôs mouth, ""Shit.""

So overall, things have improved and I definitely have friends but no friend group which is something I really want and am used to. Is it too late to join/ make a friend group since most people already have theirs? Will clubs be the answer to this or will clubs also be dominated by people who are already in preexisting friend groups? Any advice? ",3,1737416584.0,georgetown,1,1.0,False
1i64qqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/askhotels/comments/1i64qqa/member_enrollment_incentive_ideasrant/,Member Enrollment Incentive Ideas/RANT,"Hello,

I‚Äôm the new AGM at a Hyatt Place, transitioning from Hilton properties, where I focused on Front Desk operations across both select and full-service hotels. My current priority is raising World of Hyatt (WOH) enrollments, as this program has been underutilized at my property. The goal is 10% of all non-member stays‚Äîachievable, but last year the property averaged under 4%. 

In my previous role, I managed a similar initiative for Hilton Honors enrollments, supported by a robust budget. We achieved success with team-focused incentives, including large bonuses (e.g., $900 split proportionally based on contributions) and group rewards like team lunches and dinners. Accountability was key: I held one-on-one trainings, implemented role-playing, and personally worked the desk when needed. Those who consistently underperformed received constructive feedback and, when necessary, formal documentation.

  
At my new hotel, we just don't have that kind of budget. The GM hasn't (and I am not sure he will) given me a hard number so I trying to use my resources and get creative. We have a Starbucks coffee station (staff-prepared), so I am trying to use resources we already have (such as free coffee) to keep costs low. This is about the only thing on-site I believe I could use in the incentive program.

I am trying to think of both a monthly and/ or quarterly prize for the entire team (mostly to incorporate night auditors) to enjoy and also prizes to award individuals. I thought about doing benchmark rewards for every 5 enrollments or so and came up with a list of prizes that we could use for individuals. I am at the point where I feel overwhelmed and that I am over complicating things. Do I want to use a points system? Do I even want to reward individuals, and just focus on the entire team? Do I only want to reward top performers monthly/ quarterly rather than using benchmarks?

I've already put my feelers out there with the team, and no one seems excited. I'm trying to raise that excitement by asking them about things they really want, and most of the feedback I get is that they want raises which unfortunately is just not in my power. The GM is fully aware of these underlying issues, but I am concerned that he doesn't know/ care about the extent of them. The front desk department seems to be the last of management's concern when it comes to budgeting, on the job perks, training, accountability, ect. I think this is because there are LOTS of family relationships throughout the hotel. For example, the GM is married to the Kitchen Lead, and the Exec. Housekeeper is married to the Chief Engineer. Their daughter works in housekeeping. There's nothing BUT family inside this hotel, I'm talking brothers, daughters, sisters, BFF's, etc. WHICH MEANS THAT WHEN THE CHIEF ENGINEER GOES ON VACATION, HIS ENTIRE FAMILY GOES WITH HIM- THE EXEC HK AND THIER DAUGHTER IN HK. WHEN THE GM GOES ON VACATION, THE KITCHEN MANAGER GOES. THEY GET THE SAME DAYS OFF AND HAVE THE EXACT SAME SCHEDULES. MAYBE IT'S ME, BUT I THINK THAT SETS THIS HOTEL UP FOR FAILURE. The front desk seems to be the only department where there aren't any family/romantic relations. They are ""normal"" in this sense, but I believe neglected because of it. I feel like I am in the middle of a mess that I've been sent in to clean up blindfolded. To make matters worse, NO ONE has held the FD team accountable for ANYTHING. I am talking dress code, customer service, call outs, ect. 

This post was originally meant for incentive advice- which is still very appreciated but has turned into a rant. My partner has never worked in hospitality, so sometimes it's nice to vent to fellow hotel employees who might understand the stickiness of this situation. Appreciate any thoughts, feedback, or advice. Any appreciate everyone's hard work in this industry. ",1,1737416438.0,askhotels,6,1.0,False
1i64qny,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1i64qny/the_dark_roast_controversy/,The Dark roast controversy ,"Just got into pour over method to avoid the plastics from classic drip brew machines. I‚Äôve since gone to a few specialty coffee shops and was surprised to see few options for dark roast. I prefer the more chocolatey nutty flavours in coffee and have never been a fan of lighter roasts because I just found them to be bland like tea. When asking for a dark roast for pour over the employees all made a sour face and shook their heads. ‚ÄúCmon man, you‚Äôre joking right? Dark roast is for espresso not pour over‚Äù. For real? Then why do most coffee shops offer a brewed dark roast? 

Anyhow I went with a recommendation for a medium roast and it tastes like friggin battery acid!! Am I missing something here? I thought pour over was supposed to taste better than the average cup of Tim Hortons or McDonald‚Äôs not worse üòµ",0,1737416433.0,pourover,8,0.35,False

So I saw my dad (82) on Christmas everything was fine, he was his usual self, etc. He doesn‚Äôt have any serious physical problems besides being overweight and a bit unsteady on his feet (but can still get around independently, do chores, etc). He is also a heavy drinker but nothing too concerning. A few days into the new year he broke his foot in his house and called the ambulance who took him to a hospital about an hour away (two hours from my home). They had to do surgery on his foot, put it in a cast, and moved him to a rehabilitation facility a few days later. 

Since the surgery/when he was placed in the rehab he has been completely unbearable. It‚Äôs hard to describe but he is just agitated, calls me screaming and crying multiple times a day, says I have to come ‚Äòhelp him,‚Äô claims the nurses are ‚Äòcruel,‚Äô and is just overall reverting to a state that seems sort of child-like? I know this sounds awful (and it upsets me as well) but I have been to the rehab, my husband, my brother, and I have been visiting often, and no one seems ‚Äòcruel‚Äô at all. I‚Äôve met with the nurses, aids, social worker, psychiatrist and they have been very nice and helpful.

I arrived there to visit once and they had him in a wheelchair and he was SCREAMING and CRYING telling them to move him back to bed. I said why don‚Äôt we go down to the coffee shop  just to change scenery/do something? And he continued to scream at the top of his lungs and cry that he wanted to get back into bed so I said fine. Two of the aids held under each of his arms and said to put his weight on his good foot too help lift him out of the wheelchair and get into bed, he refused to do it was screaming /crying it was a horror show. He has also been having accidents in his bed and he has never done that before.

Basically I was wondering if anyone has experienced this before with their own parent(s)? He was fine just a few weeks ago on Christmas and since this hospital/rehab visit for a broken foot he has COMPLETELY changed. It‚Äôs almost like he has reverted into the mind of a child and it‚Äôs very difficult to hear/deal with. I‚Äôm not sure what to do or if there is any way to help.",5,1737416272.0,AgingParents,8,1.0,False

‚Äú... Darryl Choi?‚Äù I said. But it couldn‚Äôt be.¬†

‚ÄúNow that‚Äôs a name I haven‚Äôt heard in a long time,‚Äù the man tipped that face up at me and I saw his familiar dark eyes clearly under his dusty cowboy hat.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dead,‚Äù I blurted. The cowboy stood and drained his sarsaparilla.¬†

‚ÄúThis outsider botherin‚Äô ya, Smokes?‚Äù the bartender said, polishing a glass behind the gas station counter, which had been apparently repurposed as a saloon bar. There were still vape cartridges and 5-hour-energy drinks on the shelf behind him, gathering dust next to bottles of unlabeled brown liquor and oil lamps.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm *not* an outsider,‚Äù I argued. ‚ÄúThis is my hometown. I took your niece London to prom, Mr. Jarocki.‚Äù The bartender narrowed his eyes at me.¬†

‚ÄúName‚Äôs Ben Wiley Sr to you,‚Äù he said, frowning under his huge white handlebar mustache. ‚ÄúNow, your money‚Äôs as good as anyone else‚Äôs, kid, but after you quench yer thirst, you better take that steel horse you rode in on and ride along yonder, if you know what‚Äôs good for yeh.‚Äù

‚ÄúYonder?!‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on? This is Massachusetts. Is this a bit?‚Äù

The five other cowboys in the gas station, who were all sitting around makeshift tables that had been hammered together from pieces of the Holiday station shelving, stopped their card game and glared at me. One of them reached for his sidearm.¬†

Darryl clapped his hand around my shoulder.

‚ÄúSettle down, boys,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis here fella‚Äôs kin, he just don‚Äôt know it yet. Sit down, pardner, and I‚Äôll tell my tale.‚Äù

‚ÄúI just came in to pay for gas. The thingy wasn‚Äôt working outside,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually late to my mom‚Äôs memorial service right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt worry about that, son.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my mom‚Äôs‚Äì‚Äù

‚Äú*Sit down.*‚Äù¬†

I sat down. The plastic chair squeaked. Mr Jarocki brought me a stein of sasparilla.¬†

‚ÄúFolks ‚Äòround here, y‚Äôsee‚Ä¶ we ain‚Äôt afraid o‚Äô death no more,‚Äù Darryl said. He lit his pipe. Red embers lit his dark eyes. ‚ÄúI met death. He‚Äôs a ten-cent man.‚Äù Darryl stared through the Holiday station windows past the gas pump and toward the horizon of Peabridge, Massachusetts.¬†

In 2016, Darryl Choi had been crushed to death by a semi on his way home from UMass Amherst. He was the first friend I ever lost. His death had hit me hard. We weren‚Äôt as close as I was with some of my other friends, but we‚Äôd cut class a couple of times to vape by the creek and trade Yu-Gi-Oh cards. I didn‚Äôt think he could grow facial hair, but he had a lot of it now.¬†

‚ÄúY‚Äôever heard of Pet Semetary?‚Äù Darryl asked.

‚ÄúYeah, I saw the movie,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd the remake.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWell, turns out, we got one of those.‚Äù

I stared incredulously. If I hadn‚Äôt been at Darryl Choi‚Äôs funeral, I wouldn‚Äôt have believed him.¬†

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said.¬†

‚ÄúBasically, it works just like in ol‚Äô Steve King‚Äôs account. You die, they put you in there, you come back wrong. First time they tried it with a person, it was Christina Elspeth, the old schoolmarm.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no, Mrs Elspeth died?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt don‚Äôt matter now,‚Äù Darryl grunted. ‚ÄúListen. They put the schoolmarm in the cemetery and the next day she was crawling back all fulla murderous rage n‚Äô such, same as the dogs n‚Äô cats n‚Äô fish, but worse. Spoutin‚Äô all kinds of vileness. So her husband shot her in the head.‚Äù

‚ÄúMr Elspeth?!?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNot before she cut him real good across the belly, though. The ol‚Äô fella bled out right quick in his flower garden. So they buried both of ‚Äòem in the Semetary-whatsit again, on account of the headstone already bein‚Äô paid for.‚Äù

Mr Elspeth was my youth pastor. He always snuck us leftover communion bread and we‚Äôd eat it with marshmallow fluff. I didn‚Äôt even know he had a gun.

‚ÄúSo another day passed, and, well, the two of ‚Äòem sprung back outta that dirt mound. Mr Elspeth had come back ‚Äòwrong,‚Äô just like his missus before him‚Äì all evil and such. But Mrs Elspeth came back even *wronger*. Turns out, there‚Äôs a step down below ‚Äòevil.‚Äô I‚Äôm talkin‚Äô downright‚Ä¶ well, sorta like those red fellers we used to play at killin‚Äô as youngsters in that movin‚Äô picture game.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the hell you‚Äôre talking about, Darryl,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúCan you drop the cowboy accent?‚Äù

Darryl glared at me.

‚ÄúFolks call me Smokes these days,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSmokes Barlow. Wilbur Lee Barlow if you‚Äôre a lawman.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna call you Wilbur Lee Barlow,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúNaw, you‚Äôll call me Smokes, like everyone else,‚Äù he replied smoothly.¬†

‚ÄúResident Evil?‚Äù I said.

‚Äú... Huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe red zombies from Resident Evil, is that what you were talking about earlier?‚Äù

Smokes shrugged.

‚ÄúAnyhow, the two of ‚Äòem went on a killin‚Äô spree round here. And I guess word got out about the cursed boneyard‚Äì everyone and their mother, I mean the ones who survived, hoped maybe their kin would be the exception to the rule. So more n‚Äô more bodies went in the mound, and each of ‚Äòem came out as evil as the last. ‚ÄòCept for Mrs Elspeth, who came back worse for wear.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey put her *back*? Again?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, see, the headstone had been paid for. So Mrs Elspeth comes back and she‚Äôs still spittin‚Äô hell‚Äôs worst curses and hankerin‚Äô for a stabbin‚Äô, but now she‚Äôs also sort of a mad scientist sort. So she breaks into the hospital n‚Äô starts grafting people‚Äôs limbs together‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúHang on. What the hell do you mean she‚Äôs a mad scientist sort?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúShe was a music teacher?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, see, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm tryin‚Äô to tell you. She‚Äôs running around, hair all crazy, in a stolen lab coat, rantin‚Äô and ravin‚Äô about man playing god and splicing DNA and such, creating humanity‚Äôs next evolution and such. So eventually the hospital staff knock her out and toss her back in the hole. Next time she came back, she was a 19th century venture capitalist named Montgomery Prescott III who aimed to turn Peabridge into a factory town.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, *when* did this all happen?‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄòCourse, by this time, her husband was on his third resurrection too, so Prescott was a force to be reckoned with with the power of science behind him. The two of ‚Äòem did a bang-up job whippin‚Äô this place into shape, corralling all the zombies n‚Äô throwing em in the hole, y‚Äôknow, for science, and to see if they could monetize it. Prescott Mining & Scientific Enterprise un-buried all the dead from the regular ol‚Äô graveyard and tossed ‚Äòem in the hole, myself included. Then, when they came back, they put all those evil folks to work in the mines, or in the lab.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow those mines were dangerous, of course, with all the coal dust and gas leaks‚Ä¶ Prescott didn‚Äôt give a damn about safety. Lotta folks died. But they‚Äôd just bring ‚Äòem back. A couple weeks in, though, and there were about twenty Montgomery Prescott III‚Äôs and about a hundred mad scientists running around, and it turns out, Monty Prescott works for no man. Each of ‚Äòem enlisted a squad of mad scientists and started their own enterprise. Wasn‚Äôt too long before they started assassinating the competition. At this point, we‚Äôd all just gotten used to throwin‚Äô people in the hole.

‚ÄúTurns out, after Prescott, you come back as kind of a Dracula. Now I won‚Äôt go into all that business‚Äì you know ‚ÄòSalem‚Äôs Lot?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo? Is that a gang?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about that there Catholic picture show up there on the Netflix, the one on the island, put together by that Irish feller? Michael somethin. O‚ÄôFlanagan.‚Äù

‚ÄúMike Flanagan? Midnight Mass?‚Äù

Smokes smiled.

‚ÄúThere ya go. It was all pretty much like that.‚Äù

I looked around at the gas station. Other than the restructuring that had transformed it from a regular Holiday gas station into a cowboy saloon, it looked like this place had been through waves of disasters. There were bullet holes all over the ceiling, a massive rusty brown stain that someone had tried to scrub out with lye on the linoleum, burn marks on the walls with strange curling imprints of what looked like vines and needles‚Ä¶¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm guessing that ‚Äòeveryone is vampires‚Äô didn‚Äôt last long,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúIt just ain‚Äôt sustainable,‚Äù Smokes shook his head. ‚ÄúVampires always think it‚Äôs a smart idea to make everyone vampires, but, see, it just don‚Äôt work out. What do they eat? Turns out, they don‚Äôt. They starve. Then it‚Äôs back in the hole.‚Äù‚ÄúSo things carried on like that for awhile. At a certain point, we were just chuckin‚Äô people in there to see if there was an end point, y‚Äôknow, how far this thing goes. Turns out, it goes Evil, Mindless Zombie, Mad Scientist, Montgomery Prescott III, Master Vampire, Ghoul, Skeleton Warrior, Skeleton Jazz Musician, Man-eating Plant, Plant-eating Man‚Äì or a Vegan, I guess you‚Äôd call him, and a real sonofabitch‚Äì Haunted Ventriloquist, Haunted Dummy, Haunted Mummy, Christian Family Vlogger, ‚ÄòEdna,‚Äô Evil Cowboy, Zombie Cowboy, Plant Cowboy, ‚ÄòEdna‚Äô again, then just regular ol‚Äô pure Cowboy.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat comes after Cowboy?‚Äù I asked.

Smokes shook his head.

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just Cowboy all the way down after that.‚Äù

The cowboys playing poker glanced up at me through clouds of tobacco smoke. I recognized some of these people from around town. Or, rather, I recognized who they used to be.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ my mom‚Äôs memorial‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs not really dead, is she?‚Äù I said, a wave of hope and relief overwhelming me. ‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd have to say goodbye to her today. But she‚Äôll be back, won‚Äôt she?‚Äù

Smokes only smiled sadly.

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt find fuel for your steel carriage, pardner,‚Äù said Smokes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you a ride to the cemetary.‚Äù

I followed Smokes out to the parking lot, where several horses were hitched.¬†

‚ÄúWhere did you guys get all these horses?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúOh, where there‚Äôs cowpokes, there‚Äôs horses,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a rule of nature.‚Äù Smokes fed the horse an apple and stroked her mane before bidding me to climb on behind him. I held onto his waist, which was pretty weird for me because we were never close like that, and we galloped off up the highway toward the middle of town.¬†

We passed the elementary school, which had been covered in radiation warning signs and barbed wire. Then we passed the old Coney Island restaurant, which had been converted to a one-room schoolhouse. Main Street‚Äôs restaurants, law firms, and tattoo parlor had been replaced by a Dry Goods store, an ox stable, a wagoner, an apothecary‚Äì the barber was the same, but it looked like he also pulled teeth now.

The park that I played in as a kid had been bulldozed to hell, and in its place was a brown dirt yard with scattered mounds and holes all clustered near the center. A new sign hung over the entrance on a wooden board: *Lazarus Mound Cemetary.*

‚ÄúI guess we coulda been more creative,‚Äù Smokes said. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs too late for couldas, I reckon.‚Äù

A group of cowboys, clad in black, stood over a dirt pile. They held their hats to their chest as the eulogy was read. Smokes followed me to my mother‚Äôs fresh grave. I dropped my bouquet of flowers on top of it.¬†

‚ÄúFamily only,‚Äù said one of the cowboys, glaring at me.

‚ÄúUncle Matt, it‚Äôs me,‚Äù I said. He twirled his goatee and grimaced, revealing a new gold tooth.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Billy ‚ÄòCobra‚Äô Nash these days,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt recognize ya, son. I s‚Äôpose you want to say a few words,‚Äù he gestured to the mound.

‚ÄúWell, I would,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôll pop out halfway through.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs no way to talk about your poor dead mother,‚Äù said Great-Grandma Tess, who I hadn‚Äôt seen since 2004, when she died from stroke. Except she wasn‚Äôt Great-Grandma Tess. She was a short old man with a long rabbity mustache and two guns on either side.¬†

‚ÄúLet the kid grieve, Slim,‚Äù said Cobra.

The sun set on us. The resurrected cowboy versions of my family members became hungry and bored, and set up a small campfire where they heated up coffee and beans, and spun some yarns. I asked questions about the cowboy economy and how it could sustain itself in this Massachusetts town that didn‚Äôt have that many cows, and they responded by cussing me out and telling me to get lost, city boy. I said I couldn‚Äôt be a city boy because I was *from here*, and they took away my beans.

Finally, after about an hour, there was rustling from the mound.¬†

‚ÄúHere she comes,‚Äù said Cobra.

The dirt shuffled and ran down the side of the mound, a miniature landslide. Finally, a gloved hand emerged. Then an arm. A dirty, dusty head, crowned in a cowboy hat, burst from the pile, coughing.¬†

‚ÄúWell, butter my biscuits, if it ain‚Äôt The Cheat, just in time for dinner,‚Äù said Slim, hands on his hips.¬†

My mom, who was now a dirt-covered cowboy named The Cheat, clicked his boots together to dislodge some stones from his spurs.¬†

‚ÄúHowdy. Miss me, fellas?‚Äù The Cheat rasped, spitting pebbles into the fire.¬†

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù I said. The Cheat looked me over.¬†

‚ÄúThey call me Vernon ‚ÄòThe Cheat‚Äô Maddox now,‚Äù my mom said.

‚ÄúWhy Maddox?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúMom, what was wrong with Nguyen?‚Äù

‚ÄúAin‚Äôt a cowboy name,‚Äù said Mom.¬†

‚ÄúA cowboy can‚Äôt be Vietnamese?‚Äù

‚ÄúListen, kid,‚Äù said The Cheat, clapping me on the arm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a long day, and to be frank, I can‚Äôt abide a city slicker like you before I get my brew. Gotta fill up on beans n‚Äô coffee or I‚Äôll be skinner than a jazz skeleton in two shakes of a lamb‚Äôs tail.‚Äù

I watched my mom walk away toward the fire, greeting the other cowboys like old friends.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like she didn‚Äôt even recognize me,‚Äù I said, broken.

Smokes patted me on the shoulder.¬†

‚ÄúThat ain‚Äôt your mother no more, pardner,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSame as I ain‚Äôt Darryl Choi.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of raising people from the dead if they‚Äôre not themselves?‚Äù I said.¬†

‚ÄúI reckon you‚Äôve missed the essential theme of the Pet Semetary premise,‚Äù Smokes said. ‚ÄúThe point is, it‚Äôs a curse, not a blessing. To the living, at least. Mister Stephen King said *sometimes dead is better.* And here in Peabridge, we reckon he was right.‚Äù

I heard a metal click. I turned around to see Smokes‚Äô shotgun pointed square at my forehead.

‚ÄúWhoa,‚Äù I said. The cowboys at the fire turned to watch with dim interest, including my own mother. ‚ÄúDarryl, hey, put that away.‚Äù

‚ÄúDead *is* better. But you know what‚Äôs best? Cowboy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCowboy is the best there is.‚Äù

‚ÄúBest there is,‚Äù said the cowpokes around the fire in eerie unison.¬†

‚ÄúWait, wait, wait‚Äì‚Äù there was a bang. My vision filled with red, and then there was nothing. I saw and felt and heard nothing as Smokes watched my limp body fall backwards into the hole.

1i64m1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1i64m1i/i_just_feel_more_and_more_heartbroken_as_time/,I just feel more and more heartbroken as time passes ,"Hi sub,

I will try to keep this as sort as possible but I am pretty sure it will end up quite long so my apologies in advance.

In July 2018 I lost my dad. He got cancer that spread extremely rapidly. He was diagnosed with stomach cancer in late May 2018, it spread to his bones and when he started chemo it seemed it actually expedited even more and it spread from there to his blood, then his organs until they failed and he passed away. 

I was 21 at the time.

I can't describe how much I miss him, he was the best dad, a jolly person with a big heart for everyone. I miss him knocking on my bedroom door uninvited to tell me jokes or he used to call me and speak endlessly about so many things from food and places he would like us to visit, music, stories. He had never harmed a soul on earth, he was just an amazing person to be around and we had a special bond since the day I was blessed to be born as his daughter.

For a year after he died I got self-detachment, I'd do things that weren't me like partying, developing an alcohol-problem, experimenting with dr*gs, go out every day and many many more things, as long as I didn't have to spend time completely by myself. My anxiety was allover the place, I developed abandonment issues and insomnia, both of which lasted for years and in general I tried to keep myself busy at any cost, including with work and uni. Not many people know about this as I knew it would break my mom's, unclesand grandparents heart.

What didn't help was that my dad's last month on earth was a torment for him everyday. He was in so much pain and he couldn't even walk or eat, he actually developed liver failure his last week that caused him to turn yellow. I had to bathe him, whipe him after using the bathroom, massage his  fragile bones, he would cry every single day until he died from the excruciating pain but also the shame he felt having his own daughter take care of him like a toddler. None of this will ever stop haunting me.

The only positive out of it is that my mom and I got closer. As I used to take care of my dad (my brother was younger than me) it helped my mom depend on me more which in the long run was good for us. Also, the fact that I lived on my own at the time, made her realise I was an actual adult.

Fast forward to today, I've graduated with one Bsc and two diplomas, I'm married, no insomnia, my anxiety has been really low, I don't use any substances to escape reality - apart from my daily coffee to cope with work. I live in another country and my life in general has been mostly very good. My husband's family are wonderful people that have literally welcomed me with open arms and I'm very close to both my in laws. I miss my dad still but my grief is more manageable.

Growing up, my uncles (mom's brother and his husband -both from 2 different countries) played a major role into my life. They lived in a different country and the moment I was born they almost self-attained themselves as my second dads, especially since they have no kids. They did the same thing with my brother. They would babysit me, take me on holidays, we would speak every 2 days growing up at least (my mom and her brother are twins and extremely close) and in general, they've been a huge part of my life. They were always there for me and I never spent a single holiday without them.

Uncle 2 (bio uncle's husband) had developed cancer a few years before my dad. He fought it like a champ and was so courageous, his whole attitude was as if he was going through with the flu. Unfortunately, the cancer returned in 2024 and it is currently as far as I know on his bones and he is unable to walk without a wheeled crutch. He is undergoing radiotherapy as chemo is not an option due to other underlying health issues and we don't know how long he has with us but he is trying and we are all trying to be positive.

My husband is from the same Western European country as Uncle 2 and we live here. My uncles live in a different Western European country while my mom and brother live in a South European country. This has brought us even closer and I managed to visit them a few days around Christmas and bring some stuff that my uncle missed from his homeland. He is very proud of me as he always wanted to take me as a kid to live where I'm living rn. The days I were there were great, I loved all the time we spent together but I left feeling bittersweet as it might be my last Christmas with him.

Holidays since my dad passed are always hard (he was the most Christmasy person ever, he even had a Santa Klaus costume)but this Christmas upon my return from my uncles things are just getting worse. 

A few days ago, I got a call from my mom and her cousin, another uncle of mine whose daughter, my cousin I am really close to passed away. He had health issues and ended up in the hospital and didn't last a week before his body gave up. I spoke to my cousin to give her condolences as soon as I found out. I am just heartbroken.

I'm heartbroken for my cousin who is an angel and just became a mom and she was also extremely close to her dad.

I'm heartbroken because I feel like everyone I love is just leaving. Both my dad and my cousin's dad also died with anguish and pain.They didn't deserve to go with so much pain. Ever since I found out about this my insomnia is back and I just feel so miserable.

I'm also not a very expressive person. The only time I probably have ever cried in public was my dad's funeral and I can't express my feelings to anyone else easily apart from my husband which probably doesn't help.

I'm sorry if this gets out as a rant. I just feel like a big part of my life, of my childhood and my happiest memories are ripped apart violently.

Here's Mischa, Part I.","""Grab your dicks if you're in the 306"" are pretty unlikely life-changing words, but for Melissa, Doug and Mischa, they were. Ever since his arrival, Melissa had felt herself imprisoned in a vortex of shame, anger, pain and sadness. She watched as Zombie Melissa cleaned the house, went to work, and left food at top of the basement steps for this teenager who had arrived in place of the baby she'd spent 15 years and all her money trying for. Sometimes she was horrified. Mostly, she didn't feel anything.

Zombie Melissa did laundry when Mischa wasn't home. But that night, Zombie Melissa fucked up and heard Mischa working on his rap music from the old office he'd moved into. She dropped the basket. On autopilot, she went over to the other corner of the basement. She got out the boxes of zines she'd made as teen in the 90s, one with a comic of a rapper who used ""Grab your dicks if you're in the 306"" as a tagline. She spent the entire night doing something she hadn't done in all the years of tests, miscarriages,  injections, pills, sonograms, travel, failure, research, loan applications, home studies, fire inspections and more: she cried. All night long. 

In the morning, Melissa was reborn. She heard her own voice, saying this was a crisis and she needed help. She, Doug and Mischa went for more therapy that she imagined possible. Individual therapy to help her and Doug process their infertility journeys and for Mischa to deal with the death of his mother and the loss of his life in Ukraine. Marriage counseling for her and Doug. And family therapy for all of them. It took time, but slowly and surely, they became one.

Mischa rejected their offer to move upstairs, but bonded with Doug in fixing up hia basement space. Melissa bonded with him over music and creating. Guided carefully by their therapist, they sat Mischa down and told him that they loved having him there and considered him their son, but that good parents supported their children's goals and dreams, and that he was welcome to stay with them in Uranium as long as he wanted, but if he chose to return to Ukraine, they would help. 

It took a while. Mischa got Noel's old job at the Taco Bell to earn money. When Melissa and Doug won triple damages from the adoption agency, they gave part of the money to Mischa. He moved to Ukraine and settled near Talia.

One of life's most painful lessons is that love and attraction do not, in fact, conquer all, and Talia and Mischa taught that to one another over the next 18 months. Mischa's more outgoing nature and admiration for traditional Ukrainian culture clashed with the introversion and interest in all things Western that led Talia to a lengthy online relationship with a YouTube rapper. When they broke up, Mischa had decided to become a music teacher, because of the importance of chamber choir in his own life. 

He got into university easily (he had had the highest SAT scores at St. Cassian's, much to Ocean's chagrin). He dated a little bit and took a position in his hometown of Odessa. During one of the prep days for the coming year, there was a knock on his classroom door.

There was a woman more beautiful than Talia or the former prime minister. Her name was Oksana and she was a speech language pathologist at the school. She wanted to talk to him about an idea she had to work together. They met for coffee that evening, and several after. The talk quickly turned from work to their lives. Soon, they were spending nearly every moment outside of work together, going to festivals, to dinner, watching movies, and working on their method. 

Two years later, they had a big traditional wedding. Noel, who Mischa had kept in touch with online, came over from Paris. Doug and Melissa traveled from Uranium and were going on to Romania to adopt a 4 year old. Father Markus sent his regrets.

Life waa good for Mischa and Oksana. They settled down and continued teaching. They had a son, and then a daughter. Oksana left her position to promote what she and Mischa called The Odessa Method to help children with speech difficulties through music. 

Then, Russia invaded Ukraine.",1,1737416056.0,u_KatJen76,0,1.0,False
1i64l76,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1i64l76/a_petty_war_thats_been_going_for_decades/,A petty war that's been going for decades,"So, people of the interwebs, I bring you some of the short stories of the petty revenge war that exists since god knows how long. You see, my grandmother has 3 daughters. Being my mother the oldest. Apparently my mother and her younger sister have been on this petty revenge back and forth for so long that neither remember why and how it started. I only noticed it in my early 20's when I walked in on my mother taking a bite on a raw potato, that later ended up being served to my aunt as side for her dinner. She did that to get back at my aunt for taking a bite on a specific apple that she had bought to make a pie. My mother's words to me were : "" you saw nothing"". 

Over the years, me and my uncle (my aunt's SO) started discussing this petty (and very funny) war that has been going. Since we both are in a privileged position to share each side of the ""behind the scenes"". Some of these stories were told to me by my uncle, because they happened before I was born, more than 3 decades ago. Others I actually lived them, some I was forced to play a part in them. Please enjoy this petty degeneracy:

1. When my aunt was an yearly teen she would steal my mother's makeup because she didn't have her own. My mother was not happy because she saved to buy her own stuff. Grandmother found out and punished her by giving her a stack of sheets of paper and making her write something everyday (a prose, a poem, a letter, etc). She would get her own makeup when the stack was finished, and she couldn't cheat because my GM knew how many sheets there were. My mother took this opportunity to buy the same kind of sheet of paper and kept adding a sheet everyday while my aunt was at school. This drove my aunt nuts because months later she was not seeing any progress with the stack not decreasing. Eventually my GM found out and out a stop to it.

2. Now, these ones are recent. Christmas is always celebrated either on our house or on my aunt's house. The guests cooks and the hosts clean. Don't ask me why, it has been this way since I remember. A few years ago, on our house, my aunt used every single thing in the kitchen. Literally. It took us a couple days to wash it all. Next year, my mother rearranged my aunt's entire kitchen. She changed the placement of every single thing. She swapped whole drawers. My uncle says it drove my aunt nuts not being able to find her stuff on her own kitchen and it took them far to long to reorganize everything again. Then, the year after that, my aunt took small parts of anything that was not a whole piece and hid them all over the kitchen. Quite genius. Everything seem fine when they left but then you want coffee? There's filter holder. Want to microwave? The plate is there, but not the little wheels underneath it so it does not turn. Want a smoothie? The little lid on the machine that prevents everything to go directly into the ceiling is nowhere to be found... You get the picture. Everything was hidden either inside pots we never use, mixed inside the flower bag, etc..
Next Christmas, I noticed that my mother had a bag full of different food container lids in the trunk of her car when I was loading the presents on her car. But honestly didn't think much of it. When we left, the bag was still there, full of lids. As turns out, my mother had sneaked the bag to my aunt's house and swapped all my aunt's container lids with those she brought. Essential leaving my aunt with a bunch of containers and lids that didn't fit eachother. Not a single fit. I fount out a few days later from a call from my uncle asking if we did something to the containers because he found my aunt on the kitchen floor sorrounded by lids and containers bawling from frustration. 

3. This one is a fail. One of many may I add, but I think it's worth mentioning. My uncle confessed to me that sometimes he and my aunt get into arguments because she spends too much money on gifts to my mother. But not in a good way. Apparently, whenever she buys clothes to my mother she will buy my mother's size and then the same exact clothing one size up. She is really good a sewing, so she swaps the tags, in hopes that my mom thinks that she is increasing in size. So she double spends just to be petty. And, it fails, because since my aunt lives in another country my mom just thinks that where she lives the clothes are sized differently, I have heard my mom saying that in more than one occasion to her friends. It failed a few times already but I got be honest, that had the potential to be a mastermind play right there. 

I think this should be enough for now. This post is already super long. I have a lot more stories from over the years, but I don't want to turn this post into a book. I hope you enjoyed it. Thank you for reading ",163,1737416037.0,pettyrevenge,32,0.98,False

Over the past year, I‚Äôve been working as a tech advisor to early-stage startups, helping founders build and scale AI solutions. I‚Äôve rolled up my sleeves to tackle challenges in agentic AI, hallucination detection, mitigation, and building tools for long-context reasoning in LLMs.

Now, I‚Äôm pursuing a Master‚Äôs degree in a STEM field at a T50 university, focusing my research on long-context reasoning for LLMs. While I love the academic grind, the itch to dive back into real-world problems is impossible to ignore.

I guess John, too, is lonely. Maybe he‚Äôs desperate for someone's company. That is why he wants to hang out with me sometimes. I like him, but at the same time I think he is such a loser.

However, I have to admit that he would make this conference I attended a bit more bearable. This town is a boring town. The conference I came here for was a lot more boring.

Soldiers stood near the entrance, pointing their weapons at people in white lab coats. However, their attention was elsewhere; at the back of the room, an inexplicable object floated in the air, emitting a strong light.

It appears the shape was accessing more than the three spatial dimensions: height, width, and depth. Additionally, the time around the shape seemed wrong and distorted. Time, the fourth dimension, measures the duration or simultaneity of events. According to the Theory of Relativity, time can be significantly distorted at high speeds or near a large mass.

A porcelain coffee cup on a nearby table fell and shattered on the ground at an apparently impossible speed, only to reassemble itself immediately after. If the owner watched closely, they would notice that even the cracks from before the fall remained. The people in lab coats were scientists observing the event. They witnessed something that had previously been impossible, as it defied one of the universe's most important quantities: entropy, the measure of disorder.



""We must rethink and question everything we've learned and studied,"" one of the scientists dared to say.



Even amid this life-and-death situation, everyone stood frozen, watching to see what would happen next. The soldiers thought it might be some kind of bomb or weapon, a last resort for those on the brink of death. However, even the scientists didn't know what was coming, but those who weren't panicking instinctively understood that one way or another, they wouldn't leave there alive. They knew that no human could survive contact with this object.

Although the shape was neither understandable nor comprehensible, for some reason, their brains processed the shape as a cube. The brain, the body's main information-processing center, had to provide some response to the information its sensors (eyes, ears, nose, and skin) were collecting.



""Is this the Metatron's Cube?"" asked one of the soldiers, a fervent scholar of sacred scriptures.



As if spreading to everyone, the image of the cube appeared, and in synchronization, all those who had seen or known the shape before began to perceive it before them. Although it was merely a projection created in their brains, it felt as real as were around them. Metatron's Cube is a sacred geometry representing the Seraphim Angel Metatron, also known as the Supreme Angel, Divine Spokesperson, or Angel of the Veil, the first angel of creation and the mediator between the Supreme and humanity.

They all began to admire it as if they were hypnotized. The soldiers lowered their weapons, and the scientists who had been facing the soldiers turned to look at it. Although it hurt their eyes, they couldn't look away, or rather, they couldn't. It was as if something divine was about to happen, a true miracle.

What was coming could not be stopped. The temperature in the room rose drastically, and the room's temperature control system was maxed out. It was a high-tech laboratory, but its systems couldn't stabilize it. Some scientists suddenly fainted. Even the soldiers, clad in armor designed for high temperatures, succumbed. In short, given the context.

Metatron's Cube Hatched.

But they also say that the smoke kills you first, well, if you‚Äôre *‚Äúlucky.‚Äù* But it‚Äôs still not fast enough. You still feel it. Flesh blistering and popping, flaking like pastry. I suppose burning might be *one of the worst,* but I don‚Äôt think it takes the number one slot.  

Getting run over. I‚Äôve seen that happen before. If you‚Äôre lucky, it‚Äôs over before the pain even registers. But if you‚Äôre not? If the wheels miss your head and hit your ribs or legs instead? Then you‚Äôre dragged for God knows how long, broken and bleeding, every breath filling your lungs with blood.  

I thought that was the worst. But it‚Äôs not.  

How about starving? Now that‚Äôs a slow and painful death. Your body eats itself, piece by piece. The gnawing is constant, like teeth in your belly. Every pang of hunger whispers, *‚ÄúThis is what you‚Äôve done to me.‚Äù* You lose yourself before you lose your life. Muscles shrink. Vision blurs. You forget what it‚Äôs like to be full. No food=no strength=no will. I saw a guy starve to death once. Watched the light flicker out of him, one rib at a time. I thought: *That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the worst way to die.*  

But once again, I was wrong.  

The cold is a thief, you know? It‚Äôs quiet. Patient. At first, it just takes your fingers, your toes. They go numb before they go black. You don‚Äôt even notice until it‚Äôs too late. Then it‚Äôs your hands, your feet. The frost creeps into your veins, wraps itself around your heart. I imagine it feels like drowning, just slower. Like ice forming inside your lungs, bit by bit, drop by drop.  

Freezing to death. It‚Äôs not the best.  

Sometimes, I hear footsteps. People passing by, their boots crunching in the snow. They‚Äôre always in a hurry. Always looking straight ahead. They never see me.

Do you know what the worst way to die is?  

Well, it‚Äôs not the burning or the starving. It‚Äôs not the bleeding out or the freezing.  

It‚Äôs *this.*  

It‚Äôs being invisible. It‚Äôs the silence. The footsteps nearing, then fading. It‚Äôs the ignorance. It‚Äôs having the knowledge that the world sees you as less than a ghost, painfully and indignantly waiting.  

But I‚Äôve learned something.  

If the world won‚Äôt see you, sometimes, you have to make it.  

You thought this story was about me, didn‚Äôt you? It‚Äôs not.  

It‚Äôs about you.  

Sitting there in your warm house, wrapped in your blanket, sipping your coffee. You're reading this, thinking you‚Äôre safe. Thinking none of this could ever happen to you.  

But I‚Äôve been watching you.  

You walk by me every day. You never stop. You never look.  

Well tonight, I followed you home. Watched as you forgot to lock the door behind you.  

I don‚Äôt want to die in the worst way.

So now, I‚Äôm here. With you.

Right now I'm looking at the Option O with the 102mm blind mizen burrs, which seems to tick all the boxes for me: great workflow including auto-purge, variable RPM, low/no retention, easy disassembly for cleaning, options to grind into cup or portafilter, relatively easy/quick to acquire, comes in black to match the rest of my coffee bar, great customer support. The only real downsides with it seem to be size (kind of unavoidable at this burr format, and I have the room) and noise (which I can live with - I'm generally wearing headphones while I make coffee anyhow). 

My question is whether there are any other alternatives worth considering (at any price point). I've already look at and roughly disqualified a few options:

\- weber eg-1 - doesn't seem like I get any more grinder for $2k more

Hey, Aithority Community! üëãüéâ

You might have noticed the winds of change whispering through the hallowed halls of education lately‚Äîand for good reason! Imagine a class where lessons feel tailor-made just for you, like a well-fitted suit or that perfect cup of coffee you crave every morning. That‚Äôs right, I‚Äôm talking about Personalized Learning Experiences powered by AI! Let's dive into how this transformative technology is reshaping education. üìöü§ñ

---

### What Exactly is Personalized Learning? üéØ

Think back to those days when you sat in a classroom (or maybe you‚Äôre still experiencing it!), often feeling like the material was tailored for everyone *but* you. Personalized learning is the game-changing approach where learning experiences are customized for each student‚Äôs pace, style, and interests. With AI, teachers can now understand where each student excels and where they might need a bit more help and adjust lessons accordingly. It‚Äôs like having a tutor who knows your learning style inside-out! ‚ú®üß†

---

### AI: The Magic Behind the Curtain ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

With AI, we're talking about using data to craft a bespoke learning path. Algorithms analyze students' performances and behaviors, identifying patterns and suggesting tailored resources. This adaptive learning can help students feel more engaged and motivated since the content can adjust in real-time to meet their needs. Imagine, instead of a one-size-fits-all test, you have assessments that evolve based on how well you‚Äôre doing. üß©üìà

---

### The Benefits? More Than Just Academic! üåü

1. **Engagement Levels Through the Roof**: Personalized content means students stay excited about learning. Goodbye, boredom! üëãüîî
   
2. **Confidence Boosters**: Who wouldn‚Äôt feel empowered when education meets them where they are?

3. **Long-Term Success**: Instilling love and passion for learning prepares students not just for exams, but for lifelong learning. üìö

**Top Tip**: If you're in education, start small! Use AI-powered tools to personalize just one part of your class and watch as students start to shine! ‚ú®

---

### Challenges to Overcome üõ†Ô∏è

Of course, with great power comes responsibility. Educators must be mindful of data privacy and ensure equitable access so every student benefits from these tech advancements. As AI continues to evolve, let‚Äôs keep the conversation going about ethics and inclusivity. üåéü§≤

---

### Join the Conversation! üí¨

How do you envision AI reshaping education in your community? Have you seen any tools that stand out or perhaps have concerns about AI in the classroom? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and experiences below! üëáü§ó

For those curious to explore more on this incredible journey, check out our plethora of resources linking technology and education at [Aithority‚Äôs page](https://beacons.ai/aithority) for more cutting-edge insights. üîç‚ú®

because you own the lease as a subletter, you can also opt to renew for the academic year with the same price I'm paying. they've routinely raised rent over the three years I've lived here so that might be a good deal lol.

\- **10-15 minute drive from campus!** (depending on traffic)

\- the $750 includes a $30 credit to utilities, which I've rarely ever had to pay extra on --- maybe 10 bucks when my roommates and I use too much hot water. utilities are water and electricity.

\- 4 bedroom, 4 bathroom. you get your own bathroom in your room. all of my roommates are also graduating so it will likely be very quiet over the summer.

\- fully furnished! bed, desk, dresser, closet, side table. couches and dining table in the living area. wifi is fast and usually fine. it went out a few times last year, but it was back up within an hour or two. kitchen has an oven, microwave, spacious fridge and freezer, pantry, and dishwasher.

\- in-unit washer and dryer!!! (that work well!!)

\- ground floor unit --- the complex has two floors, so only one level above us

\- I would hand off my guest parking pass to you! they tow here, and you'll need to register for parking (20 a month) if you want a regular spot. but you can park in the back in guest spots for free with the pass.

\- access to bus routes 9, 35, and 37 at a stop literally across the street. all go to campus. I didn't own a car for the first two years of living here and travelled only by bus just fine, usually only had to build in 5-10 minutes of wait time.

\- also comes with a small fitness center, though it is \*small\*. doesn't get used very often though so you'd probably have the place to yourself if you use it.

\- pool!!!! important for a summer stay here lmao. clean with a deck and lots of chairs. front office also has coffee and tea and lots of promos.

\- 10 min. drive from Publix, Walmart, Trader Joe's, Starbucks, Whole Foods, the Asian market, Regal Movie Theater, ect. --- all the major Butler Plaza shopping centers are right down the road.

\- maintenance is fast and friendly --- rarely have to wait more than 48 hours for them to stop by. there's also an emergency line for quick fixes.

\- area is quiet and somewhat secluded, sidewalk across the street is great for runs. it's where the UF ag unit is, with cute cows to pet :) our neighbors are nice! a dog lives above me that likes to drop his toys on the ground, but he doesn't bark during the night.

up for grabs by the second week of May. DM me if you're interested!",0,1737414812.0,ufl,0,0.5,False

So I (19m) have had a huge crush on my friends (19m) sister (25f) for years now. She kind of has an ‚ÄûIdgaf‚Äú attitude but she helped me through much stuff I wouldn‚Äôt have got through on my own. Most prominently when I got cheated on by my girlfriend a years ago she was the one to call me first to check if I was okay. 

So yeah, like I said I‚Äôve had a crush for some time now and I think that in the last year it turned more serious where I feel like I‚Äôm genuinely in love with her. Well she celebrated her 25th birthday a few days ago and to my surprise I was invited, which made me really happy. The problem is that I‚Äôm not a real party person. When I told my friend that I‚Äôm going to his sisters birthday he was surprised as well but told me to enjoy myself since he couldn‚Äôt come. 

So like I said this was kind of my first big party so I didn‚Äôt know how to handle the alcohol and drank to much. It was awkward, mostly since most of the people there were older girls. Well long story short I kind of fell asleep on the couch. I don‚Äôt know how much time passed but at some point Vanessa got dared to ‚Äûkiss the cutest guy in the room‚Äú which was a trick question since I was the only guy there but she followed the dare and gave me a kiss on the lips. I won‚Äôt gush over it but it was pretty amazing. 

Now the day after was a bit awkward again, since I slept in her couch and she made coffee for me and I got to see her in her ‚Äûnatural state‚Äú right after she woke up. She also gave me tickets to her bands concert so that‚Äôs great! 

Well my friend saw the videos of the party and called me and told me to leave his sister alone and stuff like that. He was pretty mad but on the other hand Vanessa texted me if I‚Äôd like to go for a coffee sometime so I‚Äôm conflicted if I‚Äôd be an asshole to my friend if I really would try to start a relationship with Vanessa?",3,1737414780.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False
1i6445r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Birmingham/comments/1i6445r/moving_to_birmingham_for_worklooking_for/,Moving to Birmingham for Work‚ÄîLooking for Neighborhood Suggestions,"Hi Birmingham!

I‚Äôm a single Black woman in my late 30s, moving to the city for work. I‚Äôm originally from the South but spent a significant amount of time living in a mid-sized, walkable city like Baltimore with a vibrant community. I‚Äôm fortunate to have a six-figure income, and I‚Äôm looking for advice on neighborhoods that align with my lifestyle and priorities.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping to find:

	‚Ä¢	Safety: Feeling secure is really important to me.

	‚Ä¢	Walkability: I‚Äôd love to live somewhere walkable with great restaurants, boutiques, and coffee shops nearby.  Live music/entertainment would be nice too.

	‚Ä¢	Yoga and Wellness: Teaching and practicing yoga is a major part of my life, so being super close to a hot yoga studio with a great community vibe is a top priority. I usually practice 5-6 days per week and prefer to be no more than 5-10 minutes driving distance from the studio.

	‚Ä¢	Grocery Stores: Easy access to a good grocery store is essential! I love local markets and co-ops, and Whole Foods works too.

	‚Ä¢	Parking: I‚Äôll have a car, so I need a place with parking included.

	‚Ä¢	Nature Views: While I know Birmingham isn‚Äôt a waterfront city, I‚Äôd love to live somewhere with easy access to parks, greenery, or scenic views. I love my current waterfront view, but any nice view is really important to me, ideally east or west facing, so I can catch sunrise and sunset.

	‚Ä¢	Vibrant Community: I‚Äôm progressive and hope to connect with a welcoming, diverse community that feels aligned with my values.

I‚Äôd really appreciate any suggestions for neighborhoods or areas where I should start my search. So far, Highland Park and Five Points South have been recommended.

TL;DR: Moving to Birmingham for work. Single Black woman in her late 30s with a six-figure income. Looking for a safe, walkable neighborhood with access to yoga studios, grocery stores, parking, music/entertainment, and scenic/nature views. Suggestions welcome. Thanks!

In 2024, interior office design saw groundbreaking trends that prioritized functionality, sustainability, and employee well-being. From hybrid work solutions to biophilic design, here‚Äôs a look back at the key trends that shaped office spaces this year.

# 1. Hybrid Work-Friendly Designs

With remote and hybrid work models becoming the norm, offices in 2024 leaned heavily into flexibility. Companies embraced:

* **Multi-functional Spaces**: Offices were designed to adapt to various tasks, featuring modular furniture and movable partitions to create meeting rooms, breakout areas, or quiet zones as needed.
* **Hot-Desking and Hoteling**: Gone are the days of assigned seating. Offices invested in systems that allow employees to book workspaces tailored to their daily needs.
* **Tech Integration**: Smart screens, wireless charging stations, and seamless virtual meeting setups ensured a frictionless experience for hybrid teams.

# 2. Biophilic Design: Nature Indoors

The connection between nature and productivity continued to influence office interiors. This year saw an emphasis on bringing the outdoors in through:

* **Living Walls**: Green vertical gardens became a focal point in lobbies and meeting spaces.
* **Natural Materials**: Wood, stone, and bamboo were widely used for desks, flooring, and decorative elements.
* **Maximized Natural Light**: Floor-to-ceiling windows and skylights were prioritized to create bright, uplifting environments.

# 3. Wellness-Driven Workspaces

Employee health and well-being remained a central focus. Key trends included:

* **Ergonomic Everything**: Adjustable desks, supportive chairs, and anti-fatigue mats were must-haves.
* **Mindfulness Areas**: Quiet rooms for meditation, yoga, or simply decompressing gained popularity.
* **Air Quality and Ventilation**: Advanced HVAC systems and air-purifying plants ensured cleaner indoor air, improving focus and reducing absenteeism.

# 4. Color Psychology in Action

In 2024, color was used strategically to influence mood and productivity:

* **Calm and Focused**: Blues and greens dominated workspaces, promoting relaxation and concentration.
* **Energizing Pops**: Accent walls or furnishings in yellows and oranges added vibrancy to collaborative zones.
* **Neutral Palettes**: Soft whites and greys created serene, timeless backgrounds for modern offices.

# 5. Sustainability as a Core Principle

With increasing awareness of environmental impact, sustainable design was a priority:

* **Eco-Friendly Furniture**: Desks and chairs made from recycled materials or certified sustainable wood became standard.
* **Energy-Efficient Lighting**: LED lights and automated systems reduced energy consumption significantly.
* **Upcycled Decor**: Creative reuse of materials like reclaimed wood and repurposed industrial components added character while reducing waste.

# 6. Tech-Infused Smart Offices

Technology integration took a leap forward in 2024, making offices smarter and more efficient:

* **AI-Powered Systems**: From automated lighting and climate control to personalized workstation settings, AI enhanced user experiences.
* **Touchless Solutions**: Motion-activated doors, faucets, and even coffee machines helped maintain hygiene and convenience.
* **Data-Driven Design**: Companies used analytics to optimize space utilization and improve employee satisfaction.

# 7. Home-Like Comfort in Office Spaces

The line between home and work blurred as offices adopted residential aesthetics:

* **Cozy Furniture**: Sofas, area rugs, and lounge chairs made spaces feel inviting.
* **Warm Lighting**: Soft, ambient lighting replaced harsh fluorescents.
* **Decorative Details**: Artwork, bookshelves, and personal touches created a sense of belonging.

# 8. Inclusive and Accessible Design

Diversity and inclusion extended into physical spaces:

* **Universal Design Principles**: Offices were designed to accommodate people of all abilities, with features like wider doorways, height-adjustable desks, and tactile navigation aids.
* **Gender-Neutral Facilities**: Restrooms and wellness rooms were made inclusive for all employees.
* **Cultural Representation**: Decor and design choices reflected diverse cultures and perspectives.

# Looking Ahead

The trends of 2024 highlight an ongoing shift toward workplaces that are flexible, sustainable, and human-centric. As we move into 2025, these principles are likely to evolve further, with technology and environmental responsibility driving the next wave of innovation in interior office design.

Went with 40 width whiskey carbon road bars since I can‚Äôt stand wide gravel bars and did a bmc redshift stem. Went with a Selle Italia SLR gravel ti saddle and whisky carbon seatpost. 

Whole bike with flatpack and snack bag filled with snacks came in at 21.5lbs and 19.8 stripped down. Did the first group coffee ride today to test it out and held a 19.4 average for 27.5 miles with 1000 feet of elevation so definitely can go fast. Definitely gonna run this at the quad crown BWR race coming up. Probably gonna throw on a 48t chainring for that thought. All in all MSRP for the bike was 2399 and put around $4500 in parts on it.

My mum, where do I begin, my mum has mood swings one minute she can be lovely the next she‚Äôs screaming in your face. My family has always ‚Äústruggled‚Äù financially my dad doesn‚Äôt pay any child support because he lives in a different country and up until recently he had been paying for me to go to college (uk) ¬£150 a month, he has stopped so the burden has fallen on my mum, I‚Äôm 17 I can get a job but if I do say my mum loses out on ¬£400 a month on benefits she‚Äôs gets for me which would essentially be how much I‚Äôm making so she has told me not to get a job. I smoke weed, I buy the weed with the money I receive via birthday Christmas etc, my mum does not approve of this whatsoever and she uses this against me when I ask for money for college or towards my phone bill or towards my cats vet prescription (a pet that I do love but wasn‚Äôt for me initially just ended up being mine because I took care of her the best) my mum also buys coffees daily that are ¬£5.60 she has Botox and buys a lot of makeup. I WANT TO STRESS I DO NOT CARE WHAT SHE BUYS ITS HER MONEY, what does irritate me is blaming me for the financial situation when (1) I‚Äôm not allowed to get a job (2) the money I get is 2 times in a year I get no pocket money (3) I‚Äôm not legally an adult which means its not my duty 

She also has had a go at me for not talking to me dad because I should ‚Äúargue‚Äù with him, my dad will not change his mind and I‚Äôve told her how it mentally affects me, any point I make is heard on deaf ears

There is not point in replying, or trying to have a reasonable conversation because she takes a point of mine and takes it as ‚Äúyour being cocky‚Äù or something like that, we also have a stepdad who refuses to go to work he stays at home all day watching tv.

So to clear up 

1) I can‚Äôt work 
2) I can‚Äôt argue back 
3) I must pay for everything

What do I do, genuinely it feels never ending it‚Äôs the same cycle of 2 toxic parents who can‚Äôt take criticism or talk normally, I don‚Äôt see a solution for a long time and it‚Äôs just depressing 

EDIT: she also has taken ¬£20 of me in the past 2 weeks and has said she‚Äôll buy me something equivalent of ¬£50 for Christmas which I‚Äôll probably never get, and when I bring up the ¬£20 she said I‚Äôm ‚Äúmoney grabbing‚Äù and ‚Äúkeep track of everything‚Äù

Which I find hypocritical considering the above but if i said that I genuinely might be kicked out the house. 

Also the weed, in my mind if my life hadn‚Äôt and don‚Äôt continue to be so toxic I probably wouldn‚Äôt smoke as much, but when everyday im being shouted at or arguing with someone I just want to relax and let go and stop thinking. ",4,1737414630.0,AITAH,10,0.99,False

I‚Äôve been struggling with depersonalization/derealization (DPDR) since January 2023, but I think I‚Äôve finally found what works for me. It hasn‚Äôt completely disappeared, but it has improved so much - more than I ever thought possible. And the best part? It keeps getting better every day.

The cure? Quitting caffeine.

I used to be a regular coffee drinker - just an average amount, nothing crazy - until October 2024, when I decided to quit cold turkey. And wow, the difference has been incredible. I no longer experience those unsettling DPDR episodes during the day. I can go out in public without feeling disconnected or ‚Äúweird.‚Äù I feel present, engaged, and finally able to live life fully again. It‚Äôs honestly been life-changing.

I had no idea caffeine could have such a massive impact on my mental state. I always thought I was doing my body a favor by drinking coffee - after all, I‚Äôd been drinking it since I was 16. But once I quit, I realized that so many of my regular symptoms were directly linked to it. Turns out, caffeine had been fueling my anxiety all along.

If you‚Äôre struggling with DPDR, I highly recommend trying this out. I noticed improvements within just a couple of days, but I think it‚Äôs important to give it more time if you don‚Äôt feel a difference right away - everyone is different. Some people might need 2-3 weeks to really notice a change.

To get started, check out r/decaf, which helped me a lot. Personally, quitting cold turkey worked best for me - just stopping completely and letting my body adjust.

I genuinely thought nothing could help with my DPDR, but cutting out caffeine turned out to be a game-changer. These days, I can have the occasional tea or caffeinated drink when I really need to, but even then, I quickly notice the spike in anxiety.

If you‚Äôre struggling, please give it a shot. It might just be the solution you‚Äôve been looking for.",2,1737414410.0,dpdr,2,0.75,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

in this chapter, i basically set the scene, characters, personalities, conflicts, etc. really focus on her and her father, pai, because they have a conflict

feedback: i would like to hear about any other symbols and themes you see, anything you like or think i should omit, and, of course, any advice you have :))))

\*\*ignore any typos, chapter title, tense irregularities & mistakes \*\*

*1880 ‚Äî Chapter 1 (3,423 words)*¬†

A field of a thousand rows of sugarcane stalks sway gently in the wind, bending back and forth with each gust. As the sun dips below the horizon, an amber haze falls upon the stalks, which filter the light onto the rich soil below. At the edge of the field, is a plentiful river, that tends to splash on the sugarcane.

A small, wooden house sits behind the field of sugarcane, housing four people. It is late autumn in Cabo Verde, where my family lives in a remote part of Santo Ant√£o. The air is humid, rich with the sweetness of sugar and buzz of native insects.¬†

I nudge the screen, wooden door open, venturing down the steps to be met with moist, warm soil.

A dark, human figure weaves through the rows of sugarcane. Its stark contrast to the stalks creates a series of stop motion images for me, as I watch it run, like a fierce lion after its prey. It kept its quick pace, continuing its stride through the stalks that stretch for a mile.¬†

Our land is a generational plot, the fields of sugarcane growing thicker come each generation; until they eventually served as a barrier between the house and the rest of Cabo Verde. I had never been nor seen beyond the sugarcane, along with my mother and brother. Only my father had, or whom I call ‚ÄúPai‚Äù.¬†

A few years ago, Pai left midafternoon for unknown reasons. I‚Äôd assumed that he left to get extra seeds or food, in an attempt to rescue us from our rare crop and food harvest shortage. But, he only came back with a bag full of mangoes, a long, wooden spoon, a thin book with a bland cover, and a thousand of his own stories to tell.¬†

That night, in the kitchen, he began to unpack his limp sack, rambling about his encounters as he fiddled with the spoon he‚Äôd bought. I sat at the kitchen table, listening keenly while creating the scenes in my mind with each word he said: *robber, ship, song.*¬†

I imagined the concerned face of the robber Pai had seen after getting caught by the shop clerk, or the large ships who‚Äôd sail from all corners of the world to dock in Santo Ant√£o, or the old lady, who freely belted in the market‚Äôs center for spare change.¬†

Pai went on to explain that a man had shown him how to barter, ensuring that it would benefit our family, given our abudance in materials, but lack of money. I remarked how interesting that was, asking if ‚Äúbartering‚Äù was even an interesting thing to begin with. He responded with an *eh*, then left the room with no further explanation.¬†

I sank into my seat at the table, playing with my chipped finger nails as I mouthed ‚Äúbarter‚Äù. I repeated it, over and over, waiting for my brain to recognize it‚Äîbut it didn‚Äôt. I soon realized I didn‚Äôt know what the word meant. I cursed at myself and ran to my room to sulk in my stupidity.¬†

I immeadiately went inside my head, imagining that I could run and jump inside my father‚Äôs ear, scaling its tunnels and walls until I made it to his brain‚Äîa chamber holding unearthed knowledge‚Äîthe knowledge I craved to have. I would pick at his fleshy brain, ingesting pieces packed with intelliegence, so they could become a part of me instead. I would never be stupid again; I would be smart, like Pai.¬†

I‚Äôd realized our subtle difference: he‚Äôd gone beyond the sugarcane, and I‚Äôd not. *But how was I to acquire knowledge if I could never leave the four walls of sugarcane?* But as Pai would always preach, *this land held you in your first breath, and it will hold you in your last.*¬†

My eyes focus again on the figure and I squint intently, struggling to make out its identity. Yet, I was able to capture the blonde, coarse hair that sprung up with each stride‚Äîit was my older brother, Jacintocinto.¬†

It was the first time I had been able to step outside the house within the past two days, as I‚Äôd become a newly appointed maid of the family, due to my mother‚Äôs fever. Typically, I work throughout the day and night with our clothes, using a rusty sewing machine to repair any tears in clothes and a lavadero, to wash out the stains. On the other hand, Jacintocinto spends the mornings picking crops with Pai, and his afternoons lazing away outside, any last prescence of work ethic chipping away with each day.¬†

I was quickly distracted‚Äîto my right, stood Pai. A loud *snap!* emitted as he tore off a piece of sugarcane, then aggressively peeling and chewing its contents.

Pai slouches over slightly as he works to peel off the skin of another, his weathered overalls battered with dried mud. He had rolled up the overalls‚Äô ends, in an attempt to avoid getting them soaked with water. His muscles bulge out of the sleeves, revealing some of his chest. He chews intensely, soaking the sweet sugar out of the piece before spitting it out, and soon enough, he was onto the next.¬†

I spy on him often‚Äîsomething he doesn‚Äôt notice. I notice he would seek temporary alone time away from the family to ravishly consume sugarcane. I‚Äôd watch him examine the stalks, specifically its health and width before snapping off a piece, then peeling, chewing, and finally, spitting it out.¬†

‚ÄúSade! Come on out!‚Äù bellows my father, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ‚Äòbout time I teach you how to eat some sugarcane. It‚Äôs tradition, Sade!‚Äù He yells through a mouthful.

I enjoy watching my father‚Äôs habits, as I sought out to understand him‚Äîlike why he always pets our cows before the goats, or why he now avoids going into town, instead growing foods by our house, and why he sharpens knives and spears, as if something or someone was after him, and why only *he* could leave the land, forbidding anyone else from; pratically isolating our family.¬†

One night, I was awoken at midnight, by the soft coo of the nighttime animals, sleepily sauntering to the window of Jacinto and I‚Äôs room. I stand by the window of the room, and¬† scan the field of sugarcane, all of nature seemlessy blending in, except for a spot of brown and white‚Äîthe skin tones of Pai and whomever else. I observe, as the tones collide over and over, as he embraces and kisses, shielding them from the uncertainities of night, and the watchful eyes of our house‚Äîmy eyes.¬†

A dark pit forms in my stomach, as if I were the sinner myself. Within seconds, I kneel down, to avoid being seen and my breath slows. My fingers anxiously curl over the window‚Äôs ledge, as I glance again to see that they had disappeared into the night.¬†

Their closeness spooked me; I had never viewed Pai as a deceitful man, and of course I didn‚Äôt want to. However, I quickly realized beyond its mystery, it was the white skin of that scared me the most.¬†

It was a skin color I had never seen before, not in person atleast. All the skin tones I‚Äôd seen ranged from a dark coffee bean to the bark of a palm tree‚Äînot white like a sheet of aged paper.¬†

I tossed and turned the rest of the night, remaining restless at the mere glimspe of the paper skin.¬†

I was taken back to when M√£ had breifly mentioned skin color at the breakfast table. It was the four of us, M√£ had fixed us cuscus, a cornmeal cake, and cachupa refogado, a hearty stew for breakfast. The table was silent, other than Jacinto and his chomping; easily managing to spill stew on the table and himself. ¬† ¬†

‚ÄúAy, Sade!‚Äù M√£ exclaimed abruptly. I jerked up from my bowl, as if I‚Äôd done something wrong or terrible. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let that book Pai got you fool your young mind.‚Äù M√£ said, raising a finger to tap the side of my head. She was referring to the fantasy novel *At√© os Confins do Mundo*, about a young Cabo Verdean girl who once saw a European boy, and dreams to fall in love with him. However, the girl was shortly sent away after confessing her longing desire to be with him, searching till the ends of the Earth for the boy, until she eventually finds him. The boy decides to leave his family for her, and they elope, later on having one of the world‚Äôs few children of mixed ethnicity.¬†

It was one of the few books we owned, sitting on our shelf along with the *Holy Bible,* but definently the most controversial. In fact, it had become a controversy throughout Santo Ant√£o, as it is one of the only books that suggests breaking the racial tensions of our time, rather than encouraging it.¬†

I remember Pai saying that many people of Santo Ant√£o felt as though brown people, should be with brown people, and white with white. Yet, he thought otherwise, then deeming himself to be a ‚Äúfreethinker‚Äù, and the people, ‚Äúcloseminded‚Äù‚Äîtwo words I‚Äôd never heard of. *Free* *and closed*, I pondered those parts of the words, debating which one I would and wouldn‚Äôt want be. Pai is a freethinker, and so I am. I convinced myself.¬†

‚ÄúMy book?‚Äù Pai questioned, taking immeadiate offense, ‚ÄúAy, the book is fine, something I gave to her as a pastime not to *poison* her mind.‚Äù He insisted, brushing M√£ off with the flick of his hand.¬†

I glanced at both of them before saying, ‚ÄúHm?‚Äù They both sighed, frusturated with my indifference to the subject.¬†

‚ÄúIt is 1880, and society isn‚Äôt looking to change any time soon,‚Äù M√£ swallowed, ‚ÄúWe are simply inferior, and will always be.‚Äù She warned, leering at Pai, as if her insightful words were for him only. ‚ÄúThe book is fantasy for a reason.‚Äù M√£ concluded, leaving the table in another bout of silence.¬†

Throughout the following weeks, I watch Pai leave to sneak away at mightnight, with the woman. I eventually named her Star, given her bright complexion. With each time, their fingers interlock harder, like they were to never let go. For weeks, I contemplate telling M√£, internally debating whether it would open a door of truth for her, or raise hell.¬†

Regardless, I knew our family wouldn‚Äôt survive the ugly confrontation that could spark, and besides, I wonder if M√£ suspects any wrongdoing in the first place.¬†

M√£ had been riddled with a lasting fever for two and a half weeks now, leaving her bedridden. I‚Äôd fix her a natural remmedy, consisting of Kudzu root, remenants of a Moringa plant, and sweet sap, for taste. Our family couldn‚Äôt come in contact with medical care, with our choice of location. So we had to take care of everything‚Äîfrom gushing cuts to broken ribs, at our own expenses and resources.¬†

I remember Pai had called me, ‚ÄúComing Pai!‚Äù I rush to him, any swirling thoughts about him floating out of my conscious as I ran. I meet him at the edge of field, where he leans on a fragile stalk as if it can hold his weight.¬†

‚ÄúNow, let me show you,‚Äù Pai bends down, his face coming closer to mine. With our proximity, I notice his dark beard had grown thicker, as though his deceit had woven itself into the hairs. His eyes are slightly sunken, the whites tinged with a yellow. His lips were swollen from the beating sun, hiding his holey teeth. Pai reaches at the head of stalk, snapping a piece off, bringing it down to me.¬†

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù He exhales, drowning me in his warm breath, ‚ÄúI got you a nice piece here.‚Äù Pai assured as he examines the piece between his fingers. He places it in my palms, ‚ÄúFirst, peel that skin.‚Äù But I already knew the process like the back of my hand: *peel, chew, spit, peel, chew, spit*. I‚Äôd watched Pai do it a thousand times.¬†

I began to peel the skin, tugging at the tougher parts until they finally release.

‚ÄúAtta girl, a natural,‚Äù Pai exclaims, flashing a grin, ‚ÄúNow‚Ä¶ chew!‚Äù He shouts, practically in my ear. His voice spooks me, instantly tensing my muscles. But, I still bring it up to my mouth, gripping it firmly, and gently bite, instantly tasting a rich sugar. I feel his eyes electrify as they scan me. I chomp away at the piece, soak out the sugar, letting its juices weave through my teeth and onto my tongue. ¬†

Now, for the last step: ‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶spit!‚Äù I exclaim, spitting a wade of sugarcane onto the ground beneath me. I immeadiately glance up, searching for his approval. Besides, I‚Äôd followed his steps, what he always does. But instead, his face curls up with distain, cursing at me with his eyes.¬†

‚ÄúHell, don‚Äôt you know?‚Äù He snaps at me, smacking my shoulder. I timidly shook my head, concerned by his abrupt change in attitude.

‚ÄúListen to me closely.‚Äù Pai hisses as he closes in on my left ear. His breath tickles me with fear.¬†

‚ÄúWomen don‚Äôt spit! Women do not, spit!‚Äù Pai growls, pointing accusingly at me. He promptly stiffens up and began to walk away. ‚ÄúYou are disrespecting this land, young lady!‚Äù¬†

I waddle after him, still confused as to what I‚Äôd done wrong.¬†

‚ÄúBut Pai!‚Äù I lurch forward, attempting to grab his wrist, but he yanks his arm away, as if I had a contagious plague.¬†

‚ÄúPai, I-I didn‚Äôt know! I‚Äôm sorry! I am! Why are you mad?‚Äù I whine, continuing to pace after him, eventually catching up to his right side.¬†

‚ÄúPai, it was a mistake. I won‚Äôt do it again!‚Äù I turn to him, pleading as he begins up the steps. I watch him, as he doesn‚Äôt even bother turning around. I pace outside the house with confusion, not daring to step a foot into the house and unleash his anger. The door slams shut.¬†

Guilt fills my bones. *Where had I gone wrong?* I sink down into the wooden stairs, letting my head rest in my palm. My eyes begin to pool with tears, until I blink and they roll down my cheeks, staining my face. Any remanants of sugarcane in my mouth now tastes bitter, its sweetness lost to the ting of my failure.¬†

After some time, my gaze shifts up to Jacinto, watching him as he trudges from the sugarcane field to the house. The sky has darkened, its stars reflecting a soft, white glow onto the land. Jacinto arrives at the house, moving closer with an intimidating amount of bodily sweat. He quickly charges at me, attempting to use me as his human towel.¬†

‚ÄúHey, Jacinto! No no, back away!‚Äù I yelp, as I jump from my seat to run away from him. Soon enough, a laugh took over, slowing my run to a jog. I eventually give up, crying from laughter as Jacinto embraces me, allowing his sweat to get on my clothes. He picks me up, even while I thrash and kick, carrying me back to the stairs.¬†

‚ÄúJacinto, come on now!‚Äù I squeal, as he plops me down, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre making too much noise, we shouldn‚Äôt even be out here in the first place!‚Äù I grumble, brushing him off. I begin to say more, spilling with anger, until I stop myself. I recognize a familiar tone in my voice‚ÄîI sound just like Pai. And with that, my thoughts instantly revert back to the predicament over my choice of spitting, and my gentle smirk drops to neautrality, as my mind wanders off again.¬†

‚ÄúSade, what‚Äôs wrong now?‚Äù Jacinto asks, squatting down to my level to consult me. My eyes grew soft and my body filled with heaviness. I stare off into the distance, looking between the sugarcane stalks, searching for the expecting clash of white and brown I would see every night, even while it was barely nighttime. My eyes move past the sugarcane, to Pai‚Äôs work shop. There, he‚Äôd spend hours sharpening knives and spears, as if he were preparing for a war. I still didn‚Äôt understand, *who would sought out*¬†

*the Perriera family? And for what reasons?*¬†

I swallow hard, my throat tightening with paranoia. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Jacinto.‚Äù I mutter, slowing my breath, though my mind prances like a gleeful antelope in the African savanna. My thoughts circle again, and the images collide: Pai and his tone, Star‚Äôs pale skin, the metal clink of the knives, the endless rows of sugarcane fields. They became one within my mind, embedding into my conscious, and becoming an itch that I couldn‚Äôt scratch.¬†

\*‚Äú\*Do you ever wonder?‚Äù I sigh, ‚ÄúWhy Pai doesn‚Äôt let us go past the sugarcane?‚Äù I question, gazing past the rows of sugarcane under the pale moonlight. ‚ÄúLike does it pain you, not having a clear answer, the way it pains me? Jacinto, I want more than this, I know you do to.‚Äù I imply, unsure if he would actually agree.¬†

Jacinto rubs his forehead, as though he is carefully choosing which words to use with me, debating what to tell his fifeteen year old, na√Øve sister.¬†

‚ÄúSade, listen closely,‚Äù Jacinto says, his tone firm with a ting of unease. I‚Äôd never seen such seriousness shade his face. ‚ÄúYour curiosity‚Äîabout what‚Äôs beyond the sugarcane‚Äîit‚Äôs testing a darkness, one you don‚Äôt want to face. You won‚Äôt have to wait for the last beat of your heart, because that bitter out there, will find you first.‚Äù He exhales, feeling the weight of his own words. ‚ÄúHonestly, I‚Äôm not certain myself what exactly we should fear, but I trust Pai, and so should you.‚Äù He confesses, a timid look smeared on his face.¬†

His spiel calls for silence. Our eyes meet, searching for reponses within one another, but fail to obtain one. The air grows heavy, spilling onto the top of my head, then my shoulders, circling my chest, and to my legs. My lips part, but nothing escapes but a single breath. My mind is clear, besides his punching words, that turn over in my head with each heartbeat.¬†

At my incompetence to answer, Jacinto takes a final survey of me. In his eyes, I can tell he partially regrets what he said. He strides up the stairs, and into the house, leaving me with the darkness of the night.¬†

I enter the house, which is a single floor, with a kitchen as you enter and a bench to the right of it. Past that are two small bedrooms. I venture to my room, on the left, opening the door cautiously, in hopes of not awaking anyone. The room is dark, though I squint to see Jacinto passed out on his bed, shirtless with loose pants. He slept over his covers, something we both do, given Cabo Verde‚Äôs drifting heat.¬†

I pick out a towel, and step outside to wash, using the leftover water in the metal bucket that turned cold with the sun‚Äôs departure. I lift it above my head, pouring the cool water slowly, letting it trickle from the ends of my hair to my ankles.¬†

Alone with the night and my thoughts, the images surface once more‚Äî his tone and face, her pale skin, the metal clink of the knives, the endless sugarcane. As I sift through them, I begin to realize how they all funnel down to a single denominator‚ÄîPai.¬†

I splash the remaining water onto my face, letting it trace the crevices of my eyes, nose, and mouth, before it drops down, wetting my thin, gold necklace. He was the sole reason as to why my curisority exists to begin with. His secrets, have consumed me, becoming a personal source of diversion at my feeble attempt of escaping the dullness of it all‚Äîof my life. I believe Jacinto has it wrong, it *is* beyond the sugarcane that *would* heal me. Yet, I would never live to experience it at the hands of Pai.¬†

I stand, imagining the day I would draw my final breath, and my spirit and soul would unleash, floating up to touch the clouds. Unapolegtically leaving, soaring above Santo Ant√£o and seeking what the rest of the world withheld from me, all this time. *Only in the afterlife*, I think.¬†

And with my fantasy, and our secret in mind, I know what I have to do to set free both of our souls. And, it‚Äôs a quarter to midnight.¬†",1,1737414255.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False

Yes I caved in and let it happen. For context: She and I met last year around this time. And since meeting, she has had a crush on me. This event led to her ghosting me immediately after meeting. I thought we just didn‚Äôt click as friends oh boy was I wrong. Fast forward a few months and she contacts me out of the blue to grab coffee. And from there we hung out everyday. And again, at this point she has a gf who she lives with and still does to this day. I figured her and I were just becoming close as friends. I never viewed her in any romantic way until she eventually confessed to liking me and being confused about said feelings. But the issue is we didn‚Äôt stop hanging out, instead only spending more time and growing closer. What went from micro cheating turned into emotional turned into physical. 118 days of this, isn‚Äôt that crazy? She was my first love, I say ‚Äúwas‚Äù because I ended things in a no label breakup. It was earlier this week and it‚Äôs still raw. I broke up with her because she was originally supposed to breakup and move out so we could be together. But instead, we became stagnant and I became anxious. Which I hate, that‚Äôs not me. And what‚Äôs worse is that I loved her, she loved me. Our words matched our actions but I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. I don‚Äôt know what to do. But I couldn‚Äôt keep hiding this. I never told anybody about this and keeping it bottled only made me worse.

Halloween is a delightful time of year when we can embrace our spooky side, and the kitchen is a perfect place to let creativity shine. Decorating your kitchen can enhance your Halloween spirit while also being practical and safe. Here are some practical tips to ensure your Halloween home decor kitchen is both fun and functional.

### Opt for Non-Toxic Decor Items

When selecting decorations for your kitchen, prioritize non-toxic materials, especially if you have children or pets. Look for items made from safe, soft materials like fabric or silicone instead of plastic or glass that could easily break. Here are some ideas:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/halloween-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Fabric Pumpkins:** Soft, plush pumpkins can add a harvest touch without the risk of injury.
- **Ghostly Dish Towels:** Fun and functional, choose dish towels featuring festive ghosts or pumpkins.
- **Reusable Halloween Tablecloths:** Use them to dress up your kitchen table while minimizing the use of disposables.

### Utilize LED Lighting for a Spooky Ambiance

Lighting plays a crucial role in setting the mood for Halloween. Instead of traditional candles, opt for LED lights. They come in fun shapes like skulls and pumpkins, ensuring a child-friendly environment:

- Place battery-operated LED candles on windowsills or countertops to create a warm glow.
- Use string lights to outline doorways or frame your kitchen island for a festive appearance.
- Consider color-changing lights that can shift from orange to purple, adding a dynamic effect to your decor.

### Make Use of Everyday Items

One of the best ways to keep your kitchen practical while still getting into the festive spirit is by incorporating your everyday items into the decor. Choose cooking tools or utensils that align with the season:

### Create a Halloween-Themed Snack Station

Why not combine your love for Halloween with creativity in food? Setting up a Halloween-themed snack station not only encourages snacking but can also be a fun decor piece:

- **Spooky Labels:** Use labels to name each snack creatively, like ‚ÄúWitch‚Äôs Wands‚Äù for pretzel sticks.
- **Decorative Bowls:** Fill bowls with themed snacks such as popcorn, candy corn, or orange and purple treats.
- **Colorful Napkins:** Use Halloween-colored napkins to bring the whole setup together.

(M31),"First of all, I want to say I appreciate people sharing their experiences and what did/didn't work for them. Community is a beautiful thing, even if you're a part of one you wish you weren't (like r/LPR).

So, here's the rub: I was diagnosed with GERD in my late teens, though my symptoms (burping, throat clearing, hoarseness, some throat pain once in a while) weren't too severe and seemed more like LPR. I hardly ever get acid reflux and heartburn is also rare. For a while, I was on/off PPIs. But overall, GERD wasn't too disruptive to my life. Between minor flare-ups, I was able to mostly eat/drink what I wanted.

In the last few years, my symptoms have gotten worse, but they still weren't too disruptive, and I continued to mostly eat what I wanted while taking Nexium, which I've been on since about 2020-2021. My last scope (I believe I've had three total) was Oct. 2023, and they found some signs of gastritis in the stomach, but that was pretty much it. Because of the gastritis, my doctor increased my daily dose to 80 mg.

However, in the last few weeks, my symptoms have gotten much worse. I now often have low-level burning at the bottom of my throat, and have been waking up with that. (Never happened before.) I feel like there's been damage done to my lower esophagus because I'm having some minor pain/discomfort swallowing certain foods, and I also sometimes get small bits of food like rice or seeds stuck in my throat. My burping has also increased significantly.  

I wonder if rich foods and drink over the holidays caused this or if it's a hiatal hernia, but who knows. I haven't drank alcohol since NYE and have only had coffee 3x in January. I've also tried to avoid triggering foods, and eating late, and I'm now trying to sleep on my left side (I usually still end up on my back) with a wedge pillow. I'm also exercising more often. 

I do struggle with anxiety and depression, so I'm now considering trying medication to see if that helps.

I have an app. with a new GI (old one moved) in 10 days, but I'm hoping to get some relief sooner. Unfortunately, aloe vera juice seems to worsen my symptoms. I've begun drinking kefir but haven't really noticed anything. Chamomile tea seems to help a bit, as does Gaviscon Max, which I've used intermmitently for years. 

Any suggestions?",4,1737413335.0,LPR,5,1.0,False
