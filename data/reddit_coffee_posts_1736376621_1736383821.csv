1hx00t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hx00t7/symmetry/,Symmetry,"I have to tell someone this. I’ve tried my best to just stuff this memory down deep in my mind by just not talking about it to anyone but my therapist but I just can't anymore, I can’t pretend. Maybe I’m being too dramatic but I still wake up in cold sweats every couple of days. I need to talk about it.

I used to live in a small house about 4-5 years ago, the house wasn't in a massive city by all means but the city I lived in then wasn’t small either. I'm new to sharing stuff like this online and I’ll keep as much information as I can private for my own well being. Back then I rented this house from a friend of my parents. It wasn't the best, it was in a middle of the road trashy neighborhood with a break-in problem every other month for all 10 months I was there and the occasional two or three drug addicts you’ll see wandering the streets in a small southern city just asking for lighters and gum. 

I at least got a discount and I could bring my pet because the owner knew my parents from all the way back in high school and at the time as a broke college student I wasn't going to complain. I thought it wasn’t the worst decision back then, I mean it was really close to my campus but after this experience I regret it wholeheartedly. I type this to make it feel less real as this experience still bothers me to this day.

I had lived there for 8 months at this point. It was a smaller sized two-story house with a pretty big living room and a half of a hotel room sized upstairs with a banister overlooking the living room. 

The living room itself was really tall because the upstairs only took up the right side of the house. I had this smart TV on the living room wall and a coffee table I used in front of it. Most of the time that coffee table held cheap empty beer bottles and plates of spaghetti, my dog Isaiah loved sleeping under the small thing even though he was almost too big to fit under it. 

Isaiah was an English Cocker Spaniel who my parents had taken in when I was 14. He loved playing around with me in that house. Off topic I know but I'm trying to remember details.

Underneath the upstairs was the kitchen and inside of it was the pantry. It was about the size of a small closet but at the time I probably didn’t know that, I hardly used the thing. Every grocery store product I bought either sat on the tiny kitchen island, inside the old rusty fridge, or the cabinets so I had no use for it. My dog would love hiding in it though, those times finding him would give me a near panic attack because I always thought he had found a way out of the house.

Now between both rooms and in the middle of the house was a pillar and to the left of the pillar facing the living room was an old worn-down, wooden spiral staircase. It creaked like a banshee every step you would take on it. At the top of the stairs was the upstairs banister that acted like a hallway connecting the already connected two rooms in the upstairs. 

The bedroom and the “extra room” as I called it were on separate sides but both rooms were connected within them by a small hallway shaped like an archway. My bed was nothing much, I mean it was an un-sheeted mattress with symmetrical flower designs imprinted on the fabric. 

That extra room wasn’t really used for anything besides getting to the small bathroom connected to it, in fact it was the only way to the bathroom. I used it like an attic or basement, only using it for storing old pictures and antiques. All of this is needed I swear.

Writing this, it's all starting to flow back, all these vivid and small details. 

That day I had just gotten off work and made a cup of coffee. That was my daily routine: go to work, get home, make coffee, and relax. After I finished my cup I quickly cleaned it and put it up. After that I sat on the couch only I was just slightly less tired than usual. Isaiah crawled on my lap and nuzzled up to me. I sat and pet him while on my phone.  It was only a couple hours until dark but I thought about taking a nap. 

As I sat there I felt my phone vibrate, It was my friend Craig. He asked if I wanted to join the group going out bar hopping that night. It had been awhile and I missed hanging with the guys so I decided to go. I got my coat and headed out the door. On my way out I made sure to give Isaiah some love before I left.

That whole night was a blast and I remember it well, I only had a couple drinks and had an admittedly pretty heavy buzz going. It was filled with laughter, dumb jokes and just an overall carefree attitude, I miss it so much. I never had a second thought that that night could be ruined. I drove home from the bars we drank dry still with a smile on my face. I know it probably wasn’t safe but I wasn't the smartest back then.

When I got home and walked to the door I realized something strange. My door was unlocked. In my buzzed state I just brushed it off as a sloppy mistake from earlier. I was tired and maybe I just forgot. But as I walked in I became privy to the fact that yep, this night could be ruined. 

I sobered up fast looking into the place. As I stepped in I looked at my completely trashed living room. My coffee table was flipped, beer bottles smashed, and my trash can had been ransacked. My couch cushions were scratched and torn open, spilling cotton, and different objects decorated the scratched floor. 

In the kitchen my plates and silverware were smashed and spread out on the tiled floor and my floor was dented and cracked by objects being thrown down extremely hard. My fridge was left open, half my drinks were opened and drank from, and food was left out on the counter and even the floor. Most of my cabinets and drawers had been ransacked, hell even my useless pantry was. 

My pure shock turned to utter frustration. I thought to myself, “Of course-a damn break-in!” I stomped loudly to the kitchen and put the food I could save back in the fridge, I threw out the drinks, I wasn’t drinking after some junkie. I was too pissed to even clean the silverware but I did see from the corner of my eye that all the kitchen knives were missing. I thought whoever broke in had probably just strung it on the floor but I never saw that or maybe they had the gall to steal them to sell, who knows. I decided I needed to check upstairs to see the damage, so I started walking up the steps.

I couldn’t even hear the screeching steps my foggy haze of anger had completely clouded me. I’m sure I sounded like a bull coming up those stairs. I kept stomping to the bedroom furious as to what I might see.

I got to the bedroom door and swung it open with a violent force. Only to feel a wave of horror hit my gut like a bullet. My stomach churned as my heart sank like an anchor, my angry breathing was cut off in shock. The bedroom lights were off and standing over my bed was a man. He never left my house… 

It had never even crossed my mind that he could still be here. The man must have been 6 feet tall and he was just standing there right next to the pillows on the bed. All that noise I made should have alerted him but no, I still don’t know how it didn’t or maybe it did I don’t know. He faced the wall of the bedroom, a blank stare and chilling smile formed on the side of his face I could see. I could only make out certain details in the dark but his smile was just there, like there was no happiness or malice behind it, it was numb and void of all emotion. Nearly covering his smile was a scruffy unkempt beard with stains of blood in it and a balding head with barely any hair left. He wore a dirt stained baggy dark grey t-shirt and light brown cargo pants with black stains and streaks along them. Afterwards I would realize he had no shoes on and his feet were bloody and leaving bloody footprints on the bedroom carpet. 

He had wrinkly grey skin with brown and yellow bruises on his arms. I slowly scanned him and saw his right arm. A massive wound on his wrist still spurting blood like a water gun was there, I could see his bone jutting through and chisel marks along the bone as if… a dog had bit him. 

“Isaiah, where was Isaiah?” Questions ran through my head. “Why wasn’t he the first thing you checked for!” Questions ran through my head. “Where is he? Is he hurt?” Questions ran through my head. I looked behind the man and onto the floor. “Please no… oh god no.” 

My questions had been answered.

Lying on the blood stained carpet was Isaiah, every knife from the kitchen protruding from his body. He had one long cut in the middle of his back that went around his whole body similar to a bisector. The blades stuck into him like nails in a board were placed in a symmetrical pattern almost like a rorschach test picture. The image of it still haunts me whenever I close my eyes.

I felt tears swell up in my eyes as I looked back up at the man, he was now facing me. His head cocked towards me but his eyes were transfixed on the mattress. His eyes scanned the mattress impossibly fast and he scanned so many times, I thought he was counting nanometers. I looked closer into his eyes. They were bloodshot with such big blood vessels I thought they would blow up in his head like water balloons. His pupils were abyssal pits of black that seemed to swallow most of the eye. The horribly dilated circles stood still in an instant still hyper fixated on the mattress. His jaw began to move back and forth and he parted his lips more revealing sickly yellow and black teeth grinding together, no not together, on something. A piece of flesh sat in between his top row and bottom row but not from my dog. Human flesh.

I scanned the man once more and realized his right arm wasn’t the only one gushing blood, his left was too with another bite mark but not from a dog, from himself.

His teeth continued grinding against the meat as my stomach tied and tears spilled from my eyes. The teeth kept cutting and cutting into the flesh in his mouth until he cut the piece in half. One half fell from his lip and the other flopped out slowly from his agape jaws onto the bed. He slowly reached out his hands without moving his eyes and pushed the two pieces side by side. His neck creaked to the side sounding like a firecracker as if to show he had seen something intriguing. His teeth kept grinding together and even chattering as his eyes lit up when he saw the two pieces on the bed.

He began making a ""tisk tisk tisk"" sound as if stuttering on words. I wish he never got the words out. He spoke for the first and only time. “Symmetry”

I slowly backed up onto the balcony with the knot tied in my stomach growing tighter by the second. The danger I was now in spun in my mind at that moment, almost making me dizzy. My heart beat like a drum as I thought of the man pulling a knife or lunging at me but he didn’t, he just kept looking at the bed as if it was the most beautiful thing in the world. I slowly closed the door with grace so as to not make noise and headed to the steps. Then it hit me. The creaky steps…

My heart pounded even harder in my chest, feeling like it was gonna pop out as I thought to myself, “Did he see me, didn’t he cock his head at you?” It didn’t matter, I had to go. I took my first steps down the stairs. When my foot hit the stairs it made a slight squeak as I put my weight on it. As I took step after step down It got louder and louder. When the stairs hit its loudest It sounded like a wailing baby interrupting a room of silence. I could hear my heart throbbing in my ears at this point and once I took that last step I heard it. The old bed upstairs creaking. That's when the pure horror of the situation hit my mind. He could come out of the bedroom in two ways, he could have a weapon or even a gun, what if he saw me or heard me, what if he? All of those horrific situations rushed through my head as I quietly made my way to the pantry and shut myself inside. I sat hiding in there, tears streaming and a lump in my throat aching. “I wish Isaiah was here with me.”

As I hid in the corner terrified I pulled out my phone and dialed 911. As I was on the phone I could still hear movement from the bedroom and maybe even the attached room. I was lucky that day as a patrol car was only a couple blocks away from my house.

When the cop arrived he already knew where I was and told me to stay downstairs although I did come out of the pantry. He made his way up the stairs and entered the bedroom while I watched from the living room. I saw his flashlight click on and heard a groan that I assumed was the man. I heard the police officer's voice but the man didn’t even respond or put up a fight.

The cop put him in cuffs and walked him out to the car. He put the man in the backseat and got my statement. After that I went to stay in a motel. 

Only sitting on that hotel bed did a train of thoughts hit me but out of them all one hit hardest. My Isaiah was… I cried and cried that night until the sun rose. After that I called some friends and stayed over at their places. I don’t remember much else as I just stayed hammered for that week. Losing an animal from your childhood can crush you. By the time I got home everything had been cleaned and I had been notified where my friends had buried my dog. They helped me so much, they even picked a nice tree to bury him under. 

That night I couldn’t sleep even with a new mattress and new locks on all the doors and windows. Rolling over and looking at the floor I could see the red stains in the carpet. This blob of red and footprints pointing me in the eyes. Sometimes I saw this massive puddle almost like an outline of Isaiah and the man walking away after he was finished, I balled myself to sleep those nights. 

2 months later my parents friend let me off the lease, I couldn’t sleep anymore at that point. His face still flickered in my mind, I still checked every room in my house even after I moved shortly after. I still do.

Afterwards I found out from one of my dad’s friends who knew the cop who responded to my call that the man was incredibly dangerous and had been wanted for killing a woman outside of her apartment in the building hallway the same way he had my dog. He had major mental issues and was on multiple substances the night he broke in. The man couldn’t even remember his name according to the cop. 

Although therapy has helped I still blame myself. Why wasn’t he the first thing I looked for? Why? I’m to blame for Isaiah. Maybe if I was home sooner…or if… I don’t know. I hurt a lot and I miss my pup. I love you Isaiah.

My nightmares consist of me being paralyzed in bed even in my new house and that horrific man standing over me grinding his teeth and looking at me. He bites into me making symmetrical marks along my body and carves symbols into my stomach with his bare and still bleeding hands. He runs his fingers across the deep cuts on my body checking for perfection. He gets to my face and sticks his fingers in my mouth grasping my jaw. He pulls his mouth to my ear and I smell his breath, It smells of death. He whispers in my ear softly with glee in his voice.

Me (26F) got married to (32M), we had a separate rental apartment that we were living at (I was contributing to the half rent) with his parents home nearby as his home did not have accommodations for us (bedroom with connected washroom - basic requirements of a newly wed).

Anyways, our union of living together only lasted a month and a half as things went south really fast, which makes me wonder if this was a prevailing medical/performance issue in him that resulted in a lack of intimacy. He was a little cold towards me days after the wedding, and then during the honeymoon things were good, however myself being non experienced sexually and a virgin I did at times feel things were off, as he would last quite long and would not always finish (perhaps due to the aid of some ed medication).

Anyways, back from the honeymoon our intimate life did seem to rapidly decline, as after works our evenings would be to spend family time over at his parents home, until night time, and when we would come back to our place he would show that he is tired and ready for sleep. Friday nights and weekends would be about the same, wherever we come from (even during times where I have gotten more dolled up), we would come back to the parents home and watch movies together as a family late until nighttime, and then simply go back to sleep at our apartment. Like what newly wed guy wants to watch movies with the family late until nighttime when he’d rather spend some husband/wife time to take care of his sexual needs, esp while having a wife? 

There are many instances where we would just watch tv shows with his sisters until late night,or be randomly out in coffee shops killing time and only go to the bedroom for sleep. When we finally started watching tv shows together in our own apartment, he wouldn’t show any affection despite the privacy we had, and then when it came to the bedroom time he would complain about having some type of a heartburn. Or at time he would show he’s really stressed about something (stresses he refused to share with me).

While respecting his wishes on the importance of spending family time and family bonding his demands for family bonding became bizarre too, where he was starting to instruct me to specifically stand in the kitchen with his mom in the name of bonding, offering to help clean the dishes, making plans with his sisters to go out and spend time (despite me seeing them almost everyday in the family home). Like it almost seemed like he was using petty, illogical household issues to create a dispute between us and mask the real issue.

All in all, it made me question whether I was attractive enough for him, made me doubt myself, made me feel lonely (as I was literally passing time with him), made me feel undesirable and his behaviour towards me was resentful (that per him we spend an unhealthy amount of time with each other, his financial stresses have gone through the roof as I came into his life, because of me he has to be away from his family and friends)

1hwzzh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/1hwzzh7/help_with_my_diet_plan_and_exercise_routine/,Help with my diet plan and exercise routine,"Hi All, 

Any advise would be greatly appreciated. I only started on Nov 2023 and was totally sedentary before then. Started at 95.6 Kg (173cm). BMI was 31.9. But now I am in 73Kg.

So a bit of history is that I was really 105 Kg during lockdown. but went on a health kick and started my first weight loss journey from Nov 2022 and by April 2023 I was 69 Kg. I achieved this by signing up a pre-made meal program (lite n easy in my country) and then started running. I was dropping kgs rapidly, but when I stopped in June 2023, I went back to normal diet and stopped gym I had gained back what I had lost. Like aforementioned I was \~96 Kg. (I'm not proud of quitting gym and going back to my old sedentary lifestyle but life had to take priority)

So I decided to ditch the pre-made meals and stumbled onto cornometer (app to count calories). I made my meals myself and although the weight loss was not happening at the rate I wanted, it was still happening.

So below is my meal plan for the week. 

Day 1 - 5 / Mon - Fri:

breakfast - A 16oz cup of coffee/cappuccino with full cream milk; 

Lunch - 1.2Kg of chicken breast cut into pieces, Mexican seasoning, 4 broccoli florets, 2 tablespoon of oil. When Cooked will produce 5 servings. It'll workout to be 300g of chicken and brocolli and I'll add 200g of white rice. I'll have one serving of this

Dinner - Two multigrain wraps, two eggs and 50g of turkey mince (I prepare the turkey mince before hand with 1 tablespoon of oil and seasonings)

Sat and Sun I generally have my cheat days. Where I have to hearts content but try not go overboard, also these are the days I usually have chocolate. A bit of sweet tooth I'm afraid.

Below are my gym session workouts

Day 1,3,5 - Mon, Wed, Fri

Cardio - Treadmill - Warmup by 5 km/h for 05.00 min, then increase to 6 km/h for 01.30 min and then jog for 03.30 min at 12.5 km/h. I do that 5 times, and finally cooldown for 5 min. It'll workout to be 35min or so and I spend about 350 calories or so it says in the treadmill

Shoulder raise - 53lbs - 2 sets - 20 reps/set

Side dumbbell raise - 7kg - 2 sets - 16 reps/set

Rear shoulder - 26lbs - 2 sets - 16 reps/set

Bicep curls - 53lbs - 2 sets - 20 reps/set

Triceps - 25 Kg - 2 sets - 30 reps/set

Seated leg press - 155Kg - 2 sets - 27 reps/set

Hip abductor - 42Kg- 2 sets - 30 reps/set

Leg curl - 46Kg - 2 sets - 26 reps/set

Back row - 54 Kg - 2 sets - 21 reps/set

Lat pull down - 40 lbs - 2 sets - 20 reps/set

  
Day 2 and 4 - Tue and Thu

Cardio - Treadmill - Warmup by 5 km/h for 05.00 min, then increase to 6 km/h for 01.30 min and then jog for 03.30 min at 12.5 km/h. I do that 5 times, and finally cooldown for 5 min. It'll workout to be 35min or so and I spend about 350 calories or so it says in the treadmill

Shoulder raise - 53lbs - 2 sets - 20 reps/set

Side dumbbell raise - 7kg - 2 sets - 16 reps/set

Rear shoulder - 26lbs - 2 sets - 16 reps/set

Bicep curls - 53lbs - 2 sets - 20 reps/set

Triceps - 25 Kg - 2 sets - 30 reps/set

Seated leg press - 155Kg - 2 sets - 27 reps/set

Hip abductor - 42Kg- 2 sets - 30 reps/set

Leg curl - 46Kg - 2 sets - 26 reps/set

Smith machine squat - 25 Kg (2x 25 Kg weights) - 2 sets - 15 reps/set

Smith machine deadlift - 25 Kg (2x 25 Kg weights) - 2 sets - 15 reps/set

Problem seems to be my fat percentage is still at 19% and I used an online calc to measure my neck and waist. I still have a tummy. I wanted to see if what I'm doing is right. Or should I do more. Been training for almost a year now and only lost about 20 something kgs. Is this good progress? How do I get abs? Also I have not taken any protein powder and don't want to! Please feel free to ask me any questions. Sorry if my english is not upto standard as it's only my second language and apologies if I used the wrong flag

1hwzxxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/VanLife/comments/1hwzxxs/dc_only_system/,DC Only system?,"Apologies in advance for posting another electrical question.  I've read quite a few posts but definitely don't have a full grasp of electrical systems yet.  This is a summary of my current thinking.  I would appreciate feedback as to whether or not I'm on the right path.

For contact, I'm planning an 18-month along the North American Pacific coast, with the possibility of continuing down the Pan American highway in South America. For North America, I am mostly going to be in the national parks and campgrounds in Mexico. Because of the facilities there - shower, running water, toilets, sometimes electrical plugins, etc. I am thinking that I only need a pretty basic setup with the following electrical devices:

1. Fridge/Freezer
2. Lights (6 LED puck lights and 2 reading lights)
3. 2-3 plugins to charge my phone and laptop. My phone is charged 2x per day. The laptop is low use since I won't work on the trip.  I currently charge it about once a week, when not working. 
4. Small USB devices like rechargeable electric toothbrushes and a razor. 
5. Electric kettle. My one wish list item, in order to have hot water in the morning to wash my face and make coffee without getting the stove going.  Otherwise, I plan to use a Coleman stove for cooking. 

I'm seriously questioning if I would even need 120V power and thus an inverter. From my research, it seems like 1-4 are possible with a DC-only system and forgo an inverter and a more elaborate system. I'm thinking of two 200W solar panels and a 200 AH lithium battery.  I could pick up a Jackery or something similar to run the kettle, or even a jet boil, rather than overbuild the electrical system for one device.

I would add a diesel heater, 2nd battery, and an additional 200W solar panel if I continue to S.A. The rest of the trip will be in temperate summer, early fall/winter (California and Baja California traveling south from mid-Oct-to January), or tropical weather (southern Mexico).  I don't expect to encounter cold weather unless I continue.

Is a 12V DC-only system a reasonable approach or am I missing something?  Thanks!

(Plus, I had like two cups of coffee before typing all this).**

In light of recent events and the potential appearance of several Fatui Harbingers for Nod-Krai and Snezhnaya, I personally believe it could either be Columbina, one of Dottore's segments, or Pantalone who will take Mavuika's Gnosis.

However, due to the sudden appearance of Pantalone's subordinates in Natlan for Citlali's Story Quest, I have a feeling we'll lean more into Pantalone being the one who will take Mavuika's Gnosis. We've been seeing a pattern of Harbingers appearing after being mentioned once or twice by NPCs and Story/World Quest Dialogues.

Pantalone has been teased through tidbits of lore such as his involvement in Mondstadt's Goth Grand Hotel, Liyue's economy and political affairs, backing up Dottore's plan to make Scaramouche into a god in Sumeru, creating new currency for Fontaine, his work on Project Stuzha, and now his subordinates' involvement in Natlan. With this, we can infer that a small amount of build up towards his character is being made, all that's missing is his actual appearance in the game to solidify his entrance. What better way than to formally introduce him as a diplomat to take the Gnosis?

Q: Why Pantalone specifically?  
A: I do believe that Columbina still needs some more building up as we know next to nothing about her. I feel like she has a much bigger role in the overarching story involving Snezhnaya and even Celestia. As for Dottore, I don't think that his Omega Segment will move away from Nod-Krai but do keep in mind that he has one more Segment due to his deal with Nahida. Thus, it may be possible that his remaining spare Segment is the one that'll take the Gnosis - But I feel like it'll serve its purpose in Nod-Krai, which essentially eliminates him (in my opinion).

Q: Pantalone doesn't seem to be a combat-oriented Harbinger, wouldn't sending him to the Nation of War basically means death?  
A: With Capitano's sacrifice, I do have a feeling that Mavuika may hold a semblance of respect to the Harbingers - Up to how much that is? Well, it's up to debate. Given how Mavuika seems to have exhausted her powers and Natlan being a bit laxer with the Abyss out of the way, I do feel like we'll see more of Mavuika's diplomatic acts as an Archon rather than as Natlan's warrior. Thus, it's going to be a very political back-and-forth exchange similar to Nahida and Dottore's exchange.

Q: Mavuika is a very proud and headstrong character, what makes you think Pantalone stands a chance with that?  
A: With Columbina being a bit of a wild card and Dottore being the key manipulator in various events but is currently busy with his own projects, Pantalone is also well-versed in psychological tactics - All while Mavuika puts her people's safety and Natlan's above all else. Pantalone may very well use these traits to his advantage, putting her in a situation where she'll have to make a choice to prioritize the betterment of Natlan in the long run.

Q: What about the other Harbingers?  
A: Arlecchino has her hands tied with Project Stuzha, same goes for Childe, Sandrone doesn't really seem to be interested in anything except robotics, Pierro won't leave the Tsaritsa's side most likely, and Pulicinella is Snezhnaya's mayor so he's unable to leave Snezhnaya in general.

**TL;DR -** Pantalone has a lot going for him to be the Harbinger who will take the Gnosis from Mavuika - Especially after being mentioned in Citlali's SQ. The other Harbingers may be reserved for 6.x and beyond as they'll play a bigger role in the story. The exchange might be more diplomatic and political rather than a duel as to who gets the Gnosis.

Again, I could be wrong but let me know what you guys think!",2,1736382638.0,PantaloneMains,0,1.0,False

1hwztfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverfifty/comments/1hwztfy/first_date_27_the_odyssey_continues/,First date #27. The odyssey continues!,"
You might recall that in my last diatribe, I mercilessly skewered online dating for all its flaws, but I also confessed that I wasn’t quite ready to give up. Well, wouldn’t you know it - soon after posting that, I met a woman who completely blew me away. And yes, I mean that 100% metaphorically.

Our first date was a classic coffee meetup. I never have high hopes for these things. After so many disappointments, I’ve learned to approach them with cautious optimism, if not outright skepticism. It’s usually one of these scenarios: I’m not attracted to her, she’s not attracted to me, or neither of us feels the spark. Once in a while, it’s a good enough match to go on a second date or more, but I never felt the “wow” factor.  But #27? Oh, this one was different.

From the moment we met, she was friendly, curious, interesting, and cute as hell. What was supposed to be a quick coffee meet-and-greet turned into a 2 1/2 hour conversation that neither of us wanted to end.

She was my 27th first date since I started this journey 2 1/2 years ago, and I’d never met anyone remotely like her. It felt like she could read my mind, and I could read hers. A few days later, we had a proper theater-and-dinner date that lasted nine hours. Nine hours! And we have another date planned for the weekend.

After 26 first dates, I’d started to think this kind of connection wasn’t possible. I was ready to settle for something sweet and partially fulfilling; but might always leave me wondering, what if? As they say, dating is oftentimes a numbers game.  Sometimes, the wait pays off.

Will it last?  My crystal ball has been busted a long time, if it ever worked at all.  That’s what makes life so interesting - the uncertainty, the thrill of discovery, the not knowing what’s around the bend. It doesn’t always work out, but as Tennyson sagely wrote, it’s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. And right now, I’m happy to just enjoy the ride.",6,1736382603.0,datingoverfifty,3,1.0,False

I'm actually very surprised. The following is my opinion, but several low effort Monkey titles with (at the time) fewer reviews than our title made it to the ""New Releases"" section while we didn't.

I'm obviously biased, however as a VR veteran of 10 years I'm confident enough to say that our title is of Good/High quality. Then there are other titles, which in my opinion are lower effort such as ""Trash Gorilla Horror"", that make it to the New Releases section.

It's not my place to say if you should like our title, Transcend Social, but I'd love if we could get a chance to be seen. So if you can, please give it a try and if you wish tell your friends. We're really trying to push the boundaries of what you can do in VR socially. We're the first title in VR to allow you to bring any object you can imagine into the scene with you. Coffee cup?

I tried to stay strong for him - but all of this happened in 3 weeks. From the most loving dog that helped me get through my divorce (i'd burn the whole world if he didn't end up with me) it kind of feels like i failed you my boy.

When you were diagnosed with lymphoma - prior to thinking it was phlegmon, the world stopped for me. You were everything and i'll never forget you.

You did not have a bad day and you were a bag full of unconditional love, i have a lot to learn from you my boy.

When he could not walk i carried him in my arms so that he can do his bio, he had an accident only once coz i went out for coffee and he was on diuretics.

It was the most painful thing for me up to date - to see him suffering and unable to stand up, but i sucked it up and did everything, coz he was EVERYTHING.

I smuggled chemo (CHOP protocol) for him as that medicine is not available even for humans where i live. If i had to do it all over again, i'd do it until infininity, to the end of the world for my boy.

You loved me more than i can describe and i can't help it but feel so sad without you. If i can give my life so that you can live, tell me where do i sign.

Whenever i'd go for vacation, if it was 5+ days he'd get depressed. When i came back and he saw me - i can't describe this feeling, but having no children myself, this was the peak of everything for me.

I'll always remember him, forever.

He passed away after throwing up twice (liver failure). I remember getting up twice, 4 am then 6 am, cleaning him up, i'd do it until eternity, coz he was everything.

I'm just devastated that out time was cut short. Even that night, he was cheerful and never whined from the pain.

Then few months later had lot of alcohol(usually dont drink due to gastritis )which caused few mins of tachycardia maybe for thirty mins. But that whole night felt like skipped beats etc. Then the tachycardia used to occur when I had meetings etc. So went to cardio again and he put a holter and did echo. Both good.

Now again after six months had lot of coffee ( i have gastritis)and boarded a flight and got tachycardia again which persisted for long time. Went to ER then to cardio who gave metprolol daily.
Holter of two weeks showed some and atrial couplet and PVCs (one pvs and three couplets) where as previous one didnt have any PVCs.

Cut coffee and trying to manage anxiety. Any tips would be welcome.

1hwz895,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hwz895/hm_thumbthings_wrong/,[HM] Thumbthing's Wrong,"Something was a little bit wrong. Max woke up; Still bleary eyed but feeling fully charged, he sat up in bed. He stretched his arms and legs, spun to the side, and planted his feet on the floor. This small sense of wrong nibbled at the back of his half-awake brain. He shouldered open the bathroom door, opened his toothpaste with difficulty – his half-awake thumb was failing to co-operate – and brushed his teeth. He stared into the mirror, the nibbling feeling in his brain slowly became a gnawing, as he began to wake up. He left the bathroom and approached his bedroom door. As his hand reached for the knob, the gnawing turned to chewing. Max tried to twist the knob but his stupid numb thumb still wasn’t co-operating. He looked down and realised, with some great annoyance, the reason his thumb wasn’t co-operating: It simply... wasn’t there. Quickly, the chewing turned to chomping, and the great annoyance turned to great panic. The great panic decided to make itself known in a great scream of alarm. Max, having run out of great options, chose the not-so-great option of collapsing to the floor. 

Something was a little bit wrong. Max woke up; still blearly eyed, but - 

“Oh thank god!” Max gasped, “It was all a dream!” 

He heard footsteps, and to his surprise was in a familiar, mismatched room. He was laying on an old faux leather sofa, covered in seam-like cracks. Next to him, a small coffee table covered in books – all thrillers awaiting their inevitable remake as a BBC drama. Each wall was painted a different contrasting colour – either out of indecision, or a series of poor ones. The owner of the flat, Max’s next-door neighbour Frank, stepped into view, holding what appeared to be half an uncooked sausage. Frank was an older man with an irish accent. He was the sort of man that was likeable until you spent more than 10 minutes alone together. 

“Reckon this’ll do?” 

“I’m fine thank you, I’ve had breakfast already”, Max lied, he had a “strict diet” which sadly didn’t stretch to raw meat. 

“Breakfast?! I meant for the- you know- your-” Frank stuttered, pointing and waving the half sausage in an unusual attempt to be delicate with his words. 

Max’s eyes widened. Did he mean what he thought he meant? Slowly, he looked down, and sure enough. A bloodless stump where his thumb once was. This time Max chose great anger and, thankfully, next door chose a great moment to hoover as Max chose to shout some un-great words. When the hoovering stopped and Max had depleted his surprisingly large vocabulary of unsavoury words, half of which Frank didn’t even recognise, there was a moment close to calm. This near-calm was quickly broken by Frank - “So, do you want it or not?” 

“Do I want-?” Max realised he was still talking about the sausage. His face gave Frank a very clear indicator that he should probably stop talking. 

“Definitely a no then?” Frank had difficulty keeping quiet. Max stood up, trying to stop himself from exploding. 

“A sausage?!! I lost my thumb Frank! If I lost my head would you replace it with a melon?!! That’s hardly going to work! I LOST A THUMB! WHO THE HELL LOSES THEIR THUMB?!” Max had difficulty containing explosions. Frank recoiled, sensing he looked a little stupid for his suggestion.  

“You’re right. I’m sorry, that was stupid.” Frank’s face lit up. “I know! I’ll help you find it! We can find your thumb together!” 

Max, now regretting his explosion, said, “Oh, err- thanks, but I really think-” 

“Wait there!” Frank ran to a wardrobe, cartoonishly picking up clothes and throwing them behind him in a pile, before running to his room with a bundle clutched in his arms. He emerged wearing a long trench coat accompanied by a white shirt and tie, and a pipe he produced from his pocket. 

“Why are you weari-?” Max began asking, but Frank was already heading out the front door, leaving him no choice but to trail behind. 

Frank opened the door to Max’s flat and walked in. He stood, taking in every detail of the scene, uhming and ahhing to himself. After a pause- “I believe what we have here... is the perfect heist.” 

“A heist-? What are you on about? Why would someone STEAL my thumb?” Max exclaimed. This was ridiculous, he was beginning to reach the 10 minute limit with Frank. 

“Well, you must surely have re-entered this flat last night with two perfectly in-tact hands, because you struggled to leave it again this morning, when that wasn’t the case.” Frank reasoned. Max scratched his head but was forced to nod in agreement. It was completely ridiculous, but having a thumb disappear in the night was ridiculous enough, and he couldn’t think of another explanation in these circumstances. 

“There are no bloodstains, and there are no signs of damage or forced access anywhere else in this room. Whoever this was, they knew what they were doing.” Frank spoke almost authoritatively. Max suspected the books on his coffee table were well read.  

“But why would someone do this? It just doesn’t make any sense. There’s no motive to steal a thumb. Maybe I should phone the police.” Max said. 

“The police?! I’d like to see how that phone call goes! They would hang up after the first sentence!” Frank had to stop himself from laughing at the thought. Max was beginning to get irritated at how reasonable Frank was sounding. He was right. Plus, even if the police believed him, he felt embarrassed and ashamed at the idea of other people knowing what had happened. 

“We should start looking for leads right away. We need suspects for interrogation!” Frank announced. At least he’d stopped sounding reasonable. 

“Leads? Interrogation? This is getting ridiculous, Frank! I need time to think about this. It’s my thumb after all. And can you drop the Sherlock Holmes act?!”  

Frank looked wounded by that last sentence, and began to walk towards the door. He decided it would not be a good idea to make a joke about Max losing his cool as well as his thumb, because it would not go down well. “So first you lose your thumb, now you lose your cool, what ne-” 

He didn’t get any further before Max slammed the door in his face. Max spent the next 10 minutes sat on his bed, first staring out of the window until his eyes inevitably landed upon the thumbless nub on his hand. He was mulling it all over. He’d been out last night, until 11pm. Ironically, he’d been bowling with his friends – and he favoured his right hand, the now thumbless one. So he knew he’d not somehow had his thumb stolen from him then, even though he already knew that... because that would be ridiculous. Of course, it was only slightly less ridiculous than having it stolen from him in his sleep, which is what did happen. He’d not drank anything last night either, so it’s not like he’d done something stupid which had resulted in this thumbless nub. Events aside, what could the motivation possibly be? Was someone a thumb short? Did his thumb, unbeknownst to him, contain a small and valuable diamond where a bone should be? He couldn’t think of any other good reasons. After a few more minutes of fruitless thinking through countless stupid scenarios, there was a knock at the door. Max’s heart sunk as he looked over his solder. 

“It’s Frank!” 

“Frank, I’m sorry for lashing out and I appreciate the help, but-” 

“Yeah, yeah, yeah sorry too” Frank replied, quickly and dismissively. “We have a suspect and I’ve taken them in for interrogation.” 

“you WHAT?” Max exclaimed. He’d stupidly hoped Frank might’ve butted out after their argument.  

Frank repeated himself, impatiently. Max quickly stood up and unlocked the door. 

“I didn’t think you would actually interrogate people!” Max said, although he slightly hoped that Frank might have found a real clue, because he had nothing.  

“You’re right, I’m no Sherlock Holmes, but I’m giving him a run for his money.” Max now wished he had not made this comment, because it had clearly galvanised Frank into action. Frank led him past his own door and kept walking down the corridor. “Now, I’ve known Paul for a good few years, so I decided to ask him a wee favour. He took a look at the security cameras, and no one went in or out of the building all night after you arrived. Which means someone inside the building must’ve been responsible for this. Now, taking into account that there was no break in, I reasoned that the assailant must have a key.” They stopped outside a flat 10 doors along. “Now, the only person that has the key to every flat..” 

“Is this Jane’s flat?!” Jane was the resident cleaner, who the landlord did not have the heart (or more likely, the care) to replace. “Frank, Jane is ancient! She can hardly walk anymore! How is she going to break into my flat in the dead of night without a sound!” 

Frank opened Jane’s door. When Frank had said ‘interrogation’, Max had naively taken this to be an exaggeration. There she was, in the middle of the room, tied with thick rope to a dining chair and with duct tape over her mouth.  

“Jesus Christ!” Max ran to her and peeled the duct tape off her face.  

“Why are you doing this???” Exclaimed Jane, clearly fearing for her life. 

“You tell me, Jane” Retorted Frank, “We know what you did last night!” 

“Help me untie her Frank!” 

“And release a prime suspect?! Why would we do that?!” 

“Frank, she clearly didn’t do this, look how scared she is! Now let her go before we all get in trouble” 

“What if I’m right, Max?!” 

“Once again, she can’t walk more than a few metres without a zimmer frame, and besides, what motive would she even have to STEAL MY THUMB?! Now help me out” 

“Fine! But Jane, don’t think I’m not watching you, scum.” Jane gasped at the insult as they worked away the knots in the rope and untied her hands. 

“I’m so sorry! it’s a long story but I promise I’ll make it up to you!” Max said to Jane, now sat in a comfortable armchair, as he closed her front door. 

“What the hell was that Frank?! You need to stop trying to help, you’re just making it all worse. You’ve got to accept that we have no idea what happened to my thumb!” Max shouted, incredulous at how out of hand this had become, and ignoring the infuriating pun in that thought. 

Frank sighed, he looked sad. “You’re right Max, it’s hopeless. If I can’t solve it, then it really is the perfect crime. I give up. I wish you luck.” He let the pipe fall from the corner of his mouth into his hand, and bundled the trench coat under his arm. 

Frank had not entirely taken on board the message Max had been putting across, but it was enough to hear that he was finally going to keep his nose out. He walked down the stairs, past the front desk, and to a bench outside. Maybe sitting in the fresh air would help him think. He sat down... and not a single useful thought permeated his brain for a full half hour. He could think of no good reason to steal a thumb, no less steal his thumb. It was all so stupid. He kept wishing it was all a dream, but having woke up twice already today, he wasn’t holding out hope. He sighed and walked back into the building. Maybe he really would have to call the police – he was sure they wouldn’t be able to help much but it was worth a try. As Max walked into the building, Paul (the security guard) looked up from his desk, “Max! I heard about the.. Er.. The- Did you work out who the guy was?” 

“The guy? What guy?” 

“Frank didn’t tell you? We have a camera in the stairwell, and since your room is across from it, we caught something through the glass in the door” 

Paul turned the monitor at his desk around so Max could see the footage. He watched intently, seeing a figure with a flowing coat reach his door, taking seconds to pick the lock. Less than a minute later, the figure could be seen closing the door and fleeing the scene. Finally, a lead! He grinned, before remembering the fact that Frank had chosen not to show him it. He’d obviously decided he wanted to play detective for a little longer. Annoyed, Max decided against his better judgement to confront Frank. At the very least, they finally had a real lead.  

He thanked Paul and sped up the stairs, along the corridor, and reached Frank’s door. He knocked. There was no reply. He knocked again. Still no reply. “Frank!” 

Silence. Max laughed, obviously an old one like him would lose battery much faster than him. Correctly assuming the door would be open, Max walked inside. “Wake up, Frank!” 

Still no reply, but he could see a bare head poking above the armchair ahead of him. A fly buzzed past Max’s face. It flew above a tangled cable which ran along the floor and snaked up the armchair. The fly landed on an elbow which glinted in the light of the midday sun. The cable ran directly into the elbow. The fly buzzed over an array of differently coloured exposed cables, before landing on a metallic hand. Like the rest of the body, the metallic hand was bare, wires snaking through its frame. Completely bare, except for – Max looked onward in shock – one singular thumb. “It was YOU!” Max exclaimed. His eccentric, bumbling neighbour was behind all of this? He’d tricked him this whole time! Playing Sherlock Holmes whilst misdirecting him with all of these stupid schemes! 

Max slowly approached Frank. Looking at the skeletal body. It was disconcerting to see all of the tangled wires and metallic bones up close. Normally the older models wore clothes to conceal them.  

“Wow, no wonder you guys are nearly obsolete, you’ve gone completely haywire! What were you gonna do, steal my parts slowly, piece by piece and hope I didn’t notice?!” 

Max yanked the flesh-like thumb from Frank’s own skeleton and reattached it to the nub on his hand. He walked towards the power socket for Frank’s charging cable. It would only take one more yank and he’d never have to deal with anything like this again. He didn’t have the heart (quite literally), there was something frustratingly charming about faulty old robots like Frank, despite the strange nature of their malfunctions. As he left the room, he saw the key he’d left Frank to his own flat, in case of emergencies. That would explain the speedy lockpicking. Max grabbed the key and closed the door behind him. He decided on an early night, all that excitement had drained his battery.",1,1736381002.0,shortstories,3,1.0,False

She will only sleep if she’s being held and will scream and cry until she’s picked up.

Her sleep has also gone to shit and I know it’s likely the 4 month sleep regression but I think she’s so cranky because she’s tired.  We’re basically housebound because leaving the house with her is like taking a ticking time bomb out. I took her for a walk this morning and she screamed the whole way until I picked her up and got her off to sleep in my arms and then put her back down when she was in a deep sleep. She slept for about 10 minutes then started screaming and crying again so I had to hold her the whole way home.

1hwz5tj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hwz5tj,AITA for wishing my ex best friend took a new job after she ditched me & my wedding? ,"Throwaway account because I just need to get this experience off my chest. I (25F) need to know if I did something or if I am the asshole. I asked my BEST friend (27F) to be the matron of honor in my wedding in August of 2023 for my wedding in October of 2024. She happily accepted, and by July 14, 2024, she had dropped out of the bridal party and ghosted me almost entirely. For the purposes of the post, we’ll call the friend “Bethany”.

For some background, Bethany was like my sister. We met through my ex bf of 4 years, and she helped me to realize I needed to break up with him. She helped me through the breakup, I even showed up at her house after midnight a few times just for company and support.

We work together (still), would get lunch and coffee everyday, and I’d even drive up to her every weekend to get coffee and go shopping. We’d talk on the phone for an hour+ every day on the way home from work to talk about the day and complain about our boss. I was close with her daughter, who she’d bring with us to our weekend dates and I asked her to be our flower girl. Again, she happily accepted. 

Bethany was the only bridesmaid who showed up to my dress shopping appointment, and was so supportive, snapping pictures and taking videos. She came with the bridal party to go shopping for dresses, and meshed well with everyone at our group dinner after. 

The weekend before Bethany backed out of the wedding was her daughter’s birthday party. I was invited to all her previous birthdays, and attended every one with gifts in hand. For some reason, I didn’t get invited to the party in 2024. I figured because it was at a kid’s play place, and I don’t have children, that may have been why, but I didn’t ask. After the party, Monday and Tuesday she was silent. No calls, no texts, and acting super distant and weird at work. We sit right next to each other and she wouldn’t even look at me, didn’t give any chatter throughout the day, NOTHING. I then saw on FB that my ex was at her daughter’s party. He also doesn’t have kids, so my previous assumption was wrong?  I thought maybe because my ex and Bethany’s husband (we’ll call him Tim) were close, that’s the reason he was invited? And they didn’t want to make him uncomfortable? 

The weekend of July 14th, I got the below text from Bethany. She said she could no longer be a part of the bridal party due to “personal reasons” but was super sweet and assured me it was nothing personal. 

A few days later at work, she told me it was because she was overwhelmed with school and work, and not having anyone to watch her daughter (Tim worked nights and weekends). I understood and tried to be as kind as possible, but tbh I was really hurt. I would cross and ocean for my friends, I’d give them an organ, etc. I understand some things can’t be changed, but I feel like 3 months was plenty of time to figure out babysitting, etc. Plus, her daughter was supposed to be IN the wedding - so she’d definitely be AT the wedding. 

Bethany didn’t talk to me or respond to texts or calls for a while, and then her daughter got sick. She was in and out of the hospital for almost a week, and I was so scared for her. I tried to support her, I tried calling, texting, and offering anything I could to help her. She wasn’t at work so I couldn’t talk to her in person. Again Bethany &  I have spoken DAILY for over 5 years, so not hearing from her for a week was really concerning. 

Bethany finally returned to work the next week, her daughter was feeling better and Bethany seemed to be a bit more talkative. While at lunch alone, I asked her if we were okay. Bethany literally looked dumbfounded, and responded “Why wouldn’t we be?” I responded that we hadn’t spoken in over a week, she outright ignored my calls and texts, etc. Bethany says “Everyone was blowing me up asking if (daughter) was okay, so I just turned my phone off. I was just super annoyed.” I knew this wasn’t true because another woman at work knew details about what was wrong with Bethany’s daughter and has implied she spoken to her everyday. However, in the conversation with Bethany I apologized for blowing her up and annoying her, and she said “No, not you just everyone else.”

So I let it go. But since then, we don’t call, we don’t text, we don’t hangout outside of work. Not for my lack of trying. She just ghosted me. And yet I had to see her at work every single day, have coffee together, and act like everything was hunky dory. 

We discussed at work that Bethany and her daughter were still invited to the flower party, bridal shower., and wedding (plus Tim, too). At first, Bethany was onboard and acted excited to still attend everything. As each event came, Bethany simply didn’t show. No text or anything. The bridal party was the only thing she outright texted me to tell me she wasn’t able to come (the day of.) 

After that, literally 3 weeks before my wedding, Bethany said “Idk if I can even come to the wedding anymore, Tim has to work and I have schoolwork to do.” I was shocked. I asked if her if Tim could switch days with someone, if she could get her schoolwork done for that day at another time, and she said she just couldn’t do it. 

All this happened consecutively 3 months before the wedding. I was devastated. I had basically lost my best friend and my connection with her daughter. Bethany all the while acting like she didn’t care at all. She didn’t make an effort to repair our relationship or even try to explain what the hell happened for all this to occur. 

The day of my wedding came, and deep down I’d hoped she’d at least text me. She didn’t. Nor did she in the 2 weeks following while on our honeymoon. We didn’t speak until I came back to work, and she never once congratulated me or asked about the wedding. Not once. 

I haven’t seen Bethany outside of work, texted or talked since her daughter’s birthday party. I’m heartbroken and taking the steps to heal and move on as best I can while still seeing her everyday and acting like I’m fine. 

This was brought back up because she recently applied to a new job, got an offer, and put in her resignation. I was happy for her and still want nothing but the absolute best for her, and this was a great company with what seemed like a much less toxic work environment. She put in her resignation, and I felt a bit of relief knowing I wouldn’t have to see her everyday and bring up the pain of our friendship. 

Our company counter offered her the day before she was supposed to leave, and she accepted. And once again, I’m devastated. The pain doesn’t stop when I have to see her everyday.

Last week at a group lunch, our male coworker Jason was talking about getting married soon, and how his fiancée Eileen doesn’t have many girlfriends to go shopping with, etc. Bethany tells him she’ll go dress shopping with Eileen and help her plan the wedding. I literally tried not to laugh out loud. Bethany and Eileen have met ONCE at a work event. They didn’t even have each other’s phone numbers. WHAT THE FUCK. I had to use every ounce of willpower the good lord has bestowed upon me not to laugh out loud. How could she help this random woman with her wedding when she couldn’t attend a single event for mine?! After committing to being Matron of Honor and her daughter being our flower girl?! I was flabbergasted and pissed off, and had to keep my mouth shut. Then just today, again at a group lunch, she proclaims she’s hanging out with Elieen this weekend to talk wedding stuff. Jason and Bethany giggled, and I’m literally sitting across from them trying not to gouge my eyeballs out with a fork. 

Am I crazy to be fucking livid? Did I do something to upset her last summer to cause our friendship to dissolve? Everything seemingly happened out of nowhere. All the recent events and comments since my wedding are getting under my skin. It seems like in some cases she’s intentionally trying to hurt me. She’s extremely smart and a bit manipulative, so I wouldn’t put it past her. 

Am I the asshole for wishing she’d left for the other job? Can anyone provide any hint as to wtf happened? Please help me process. ",7,1736380839.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,1.0,False

(that's what we love to do).  My partner is great at driving on other side of road, and driven all over Australia and UK.

We are tasked with taking my sister and her husband (late 50's, very hip, like drinking) to Ireland in July, and they both have never traveled outside the USA.

My partner & I like to do nice city hotels (ie: 4 star) and that's the first thing I am having a hard time finding in Dublin & Galway.  A little nervous - first time traveling with my sister and I want it to be perfect so that's really why I am posting - any standouts (good or bad) for confirmation.

My trip so far:

Stay in Galway 4 nights (the g Hotel & Spa?), do a food walking tour, visit Doolin & Visit Killarney.  Then drive to Dublin (Conrad Dublin?) and visit St Patrick's/Christ Church, Jameson Bow St Distillery & Kilkenny Castle.

Out of the looney bin, into the fire","A whole week in the psych ward, I did my time. Someone on my last post said “do they really keep drunks like that? I thought they needed those beds for actual people.”

Well my dear friend, you are half correct. It was my idea to go to the grippy-sock haven this time, as I was incontinent, shitting black, and vomiting coffee grounds. All of my clothes reeked of shit and piss, open wounds everywhere, and enough sarcasm in my voice to make satan himself blush. 

 The only thing missing weirdly was jaundice, which I’ve only had twice in the past. It turns out, my numerous lab test results this time kept coming back with lower liver enzymes than the last, around 80 ALT/AST upon leaving. That should be fucking impossible, since my entire Destroy Your Dick December was just one big blur of me getting my dick chopped off.

I kept going back and forth between insomnia and sleep in the hospital. SUPER VIVID dreams (not really nightmares somehow) everytime I slept on Ativan. I Also kept flipping back and forth on whether I want to get out or not, and I have BPD so it made it a lot worse. 

Half of me was like “FUCK IT! I FEEL HEALTHY ENOUGH! LET ME GET BACK OUT THERE AND DESTROY MY BODY!”

The other half: “should I go outside? What if I drink again, I know I will. I made so much progress. I don’t even have a place to stay, and this bed is kinda comfy.” And then I’d break down in tears and cry myself into a coma.

Then, before I could make up my mind, the doctors today were like “welp, your fucking discharged mate. Get your shit and get out.” I even expressed to this one male nurse that I had suicidal ideation and he’s like “it’s okay brotha, we got you here.” 

Until he got word from the doctors that were too busy to give me my discharge papers to toss me the fuck out and he’s like “ya gotta go mon’ (he was Jamaican lol) ya want a wheelchair or not?”

The hospital even arranges Lyfts, but they were so busy and this one male nurse was doing all the heavy lyfting (pun intended) that he’s like “I can’t figure it out right now, ya good to go?” So I was politely yeeted out for the first time in a while.",1,1736380553.0,u_Drunkretardmcgee,0,1.0,False

It's how I control right now not exhausting my support group and resisting the urge 

So I write this here pretending it's him

Don't mind my cry into the void please)

If you wanted to know if it was real it was. I wouldn't be this irrational if it wasn't.. it was real for me.. the whole freaking time. 

I just wish it had been for you or at least if it was you had an odd way of demonstrating it 

I'm finally calmed and I'm finally breathing again...

Thank god for reddit 

I'm prepping to go into the hospital suffice to say I'm not doing ok. 

I will though 

I couldn't stay anymore... It hurt.. every single time you'd forget me...and do something that would result in my pain... 

I did give you grace since date 1... I don't know what else I have left to give you...

I wouldn't even have anything to offer you at this point...

A lie?

Masked pain? 

Money....

Someone to keep your thoughts warm I don't know what my purpose was this whole relationship because your words would say one thing and then you'd on repeat week after week would add to the same pattern

What is it you even truly wanted from me? Why even me? I wish it wasn't me..whatever you wanted for the time we were together 

For once I wish I was used for intimacy and just left... 

I don't really know how to deal.. I don't want to turn to my support I've put them through enough and I can't vent or process on facebook.. I have too many eyes on me... So bow out...can't smile for insta...so eh... Imogen will wait... I'm here now


I'm just processing and I don't know how that manifests so.. isolation is safest for those around me. 

I feel like such a whore...literally and metaphysically... 

The full affects of the word

And I'm scared I'll slip...and end up in your arms again... Feeding myself this fantasy that some day I'll believe you love me and everything will be ok...I can pretend the routine ...it's routine at this point... Wont happen again...

But I cant have that hope and fantasy broken again 

You have no idea what that does to me or changes me on a fundamental level

If you can't tell darling by my reddit I'm not really controlling my emotions well

The only thing I'm controlling is my reaction... It has to come out somewhere so I choose a format where my words have no affect over anyone

I got this... I'm not really alone
 There are always souls on reddit to talk to until I feel safe enough to venture again

All this after my hospital visit of course.. if I'm not this ok..I need to go somewhere with more access to mental health and where I feel safe to break and let that take what ever form that takes and I choose a way from my loved ones for saftey. 

Break... Repair...rinse..repeat and re-enter life ... Not happy but hopefully slighty better 

It's intake time now (FINALLY) Good bye phone...good bye world... I'm gonna have a safe and controlled tantrum in my room once I get there and let them interpret what they want... Useally works at getting it out aaannnd I get the benefits of looking absolutely right at home for once 

It's really not that bad it's like adult daycare I get crafts lol 😂 and people so I'm chilli

Further note for those who read to the end... Thank you and advice for going to the mental hospital.. that's your time to act crazy... They've seen it all before... Don't hold it in lay on the ground and flail and scream for a bit...if they ask what you're doing just tell them it's a tantrum and you will stop when it's out and they will have a prperfectly happy patient after... But yeah... Walk around in those grippy socks ... Make schemes to sneak coffee (they had cameras so I think they knew they just enjoyed the group effort for something so small I think) watch stupid movies do some crafts and relinquish the outside for a few days 

You will feel better I promise

He never stays still. Always chattering. Wants to go go go. Can't sit still. He just turned 2. He plays very well independently at home. When we're out though it's gotten where he's fussy and I end up wrestling with a toddler. No toys or snacks will distract him anymore. Yesterday we were at a sick visit at the pediatrician and he wanted to run around and run up to every kid there which I obviously didn't let him do because everyone there was sick. This resulted in me wrestling a screaming toddler for an hour while everyone stared at us. I was so embarrassed. One mom was on the phone and even complaining on the phone about us 🙃 I'm not going to let him run around and act wild to everyone. I don't want to be the person with the screaming kid though. Please give me all your advice for these types of situations. How have you worked with your 2 year olds on not being so loud and not running off? 
He sits to read lots of books at home but I can't take him to story time at the library because he just wants to run around to all the other kids, play with their toys and won't pay any attention to the story or music. Last one I went to I ended up carrying him out and leaving while he was kicking and crying because I wouldn't let him just run around. I know exploring and climbing is normal at this age but he's climbing on things he knows he shouldn't and I want to work on him listening more. 
I see those parents talking about how they don't baby proof their house because their children don't mess with things or climb on things. Please share the secret sauce with me because I want to know. There's locks on my cabinets. I tell him to not climb and redirect him away from trying to climb on my coffee table all day. I just want all your advice for working with 2 year olds on listening better when told no at home. He surprisingly did great with our Christmas tree though. He would tell himself no and point at ornaments which was so funny. If only he would take that approach to everything else in the house. ",0,1736380499.0,toddlers,1,0.5,False

**AITAH for refusing to continue providing free childcare for my stepdaughter?**



I did a work program with the local clerk of court's office when I was in high school. They hired me when I graduated, and I had my 30 service years before I turned 50. With 30 service years you can get your full pension at any age. I worked until my first grandchild was born, then I retired to be 'grandma daycare.' I have 5 grands 8 male from my stepson, 7 male from my son, 5 female and 18 month male from my daughter. I babysat all of them with no issues or complaints. I still keep the 18 month old Monday-Friday and the older ones Summer and school holidays.

My stepdaughter and her boyfriend has been non-stop drama since before the baby was born. When she was 10 weeks pregnant they presented a 3 page list of rules for when I was babysitting. They said if I didn't sign it, they wouldn't allow me to babysit. I said that I understood their need to do what was best for their baby and I assured them that there would be no hurt feelings on my end when they made other childcare arrangements.

Some of the rules were almost understandable but most were down right ridiculous, and none of it was going to work for me. I don't remember them all but some examples are: I can't take the baby anywhere without their permission; I can't watch more than 1 additional child while babysitting; I can't cook; I had to provide the full name, dob and address of any potential visitors ahead of time for their approval of the person being 'around' their child; they have to know anytime I have a guest over and know who it is and how long they stay; My 9 year old cat would have to be kept out of rooms where the baby would be, even when the baby wasn't there; I couldn't get another pet without their agreement.

When she was 7 months along they came back with revised rules in an attempt to compromise. I again let them know that their expectations were not going to fit with my life and they should just find other childcare.

Two days after my stepdaughter went back to work, she called and asked if I could keep Cullen the next day. I agreed but made it clear that I was going to provide safe, appropriate care according to my judgement and I wasn't going to deal with complaints or whatever that I was violating their rules because I wanted it very clear that I was not agreeing to any of that.

My stepdaughter was okay on the days she picked Cullen up and dropped him off. I felt like she was interrogating me every time she picked him up but it was tolerable but her boyfriend was downright rude. I got to the point where I actually spent Sunday dreading the start of the week because of dealing with both of them but especially his behavior. At minimum he'd pick up Cullen, make a big deal of partially undress him, make at least one snide comment about my cat or if I had any grandchild over besides the 18 month old or if I had cooked or whatever. Then he'd say, I guess we don't have any choice but to put up with this for now. Or I guess you are happy that you won.

This went on for 4 months.

I spoke to my stepdaughter several times about it and told her that obviously they are very unhappy with how I cared for Cullen and that they should really work on finding something else and that in the meantime he needed to be less vocal about it. It would get better for a day or two and then he'd start again.

It all came to a head as Thanksgiving was approaching. He was very verbal about the fact that he didn't want me to keep all my grandchildren over the break. I made it very clear that there would be a couple of days that I had all of them and that they needed to make other arrangements if they had a problem.

They didn’t make other arrangements and when he picked Cullen up on the first day that I had all my grands, he was very rude and although nothing happened, everyone was happy, clean, fed, had a great day he said (to Cullen) that he was sorry that they had no choice except to leave him in an unsafe situation to be neglected.

I called my stepdaughter that night, relayed to her what was said and told her that she had two weeks to make other arrangements and that she needed to drop off and pick up Cullen during those two weeks and if her boyfriend came to drop him off I would refuse to keep him and if he picked him up I would not keep him again.

So things were better only dealing with her. At some point she asked me if I would keep him until January because they found someone but he couldn't start until then. I agreed. She picked Cullen up and dropped him off everything was fine.

New Year's Day several people sent me a screenshot of a post her boyfriend made on social media about how thankful he was that they were finally able to leave Cullen without worrying about his safety or him being neglected. He didn't outright name me or accuse me of anything specific but anyone who knows us, knows I was keeping him and the post implied plenty.

I was just happy that it was over.

Friday she called me and said that their new childcare provider had told her that Cullen wasn't a good fit and that she couldn't bring him back Monday. She asked if I would start keeping him again. I told her that I was sorry for their situation but I really don't feel comfortable keeping him.

My husband and stepson both think I should watch Cullen under the agreement that Amanda drop him off and pick him up because they think her boyfriend is the big problem and that I should just do it for Cullen's sake. My stepson also commented that I'd probably be more willing to let it go if it had been a conflict with my daughter's husband.

My pension is about $4,000/month plus continuation of my health insurance. That's about 40% of our take home income if that matters.

Aitah for refusing to start watching Cullen again?

*Baby daddy has a real problem. That’s very controlling behavior there. He also may have a distorted view of you if your stepdaughter has complained about her evil stepmother before the baby. Until she needed you that is*



**Terpsichorean\_Wombat**

*Giving 20 to 1 it's the father who isn't a ""good fit"" for the new childcare. Bet he went on a dictatorial bender once he was paying and thought that meant he could demand anything he wanted.*



**teresajs**

*NTA No, you shouldn't put yourself through this ""for Cullen's sake"".  Cullen will get cared for regardless.  There's no need for you to set yourself on fire because your stepdaughter and her BF can't behave like normal human beings. Your husband and stepson are welcome to offer free childcare and put up with this treatment if it's important to them.  But you've done your time.  Learn from that experience and don't let yourself be put in the same situation again.*



**blackbird24601**

*theres a reason the licensed daycare wont keep him its the boyfriend the liability alone would make me pause. he could ruin your lives*

*Yeah boyfriend could call CPS because of the cat or some other crazy idea. Stay away from these people.*



**SomeGuyInTheUK**

*Cullen stands up, Cullen falls over, Cullen bumps head, Cullen gets bruise/mark.*

*BF calls CPS.*

*Fuck that. This is why the daycare bailed either they saw the FB post or BF made some low key threat veiled as a comment when picking up Cullen and they didn't want to risk anything.*



**\*\*Judgement - NTA\*\***



**Update - 1 day later**



First let me just address the common suggestion that Amanda's boyfriend is purposely sabotaging their childcare to trap her at home. They make roughly the same amount of money and definitely can't afford to lose half their income. I seriously doubt he wants her to stay home.

Second, I would never tell my stepson to find someone else to watch his child because of a simple difference of opinion. My grandson and I have a very close bond. He's the oldest and it would break my heart and his if he didn't come spend his holidays and summers with me. Plus he's a huge help with the little ones when I have them all and things get hectic. I would never be so petty as to make him (and all my other grandchildren) suffer because of an adult disagreement.

So I sort of asked around about why they were dropped by their new sitter so quickly. Apparently they weren't. Amanda picked Cullen up and dropped him off both days he went and everything was lovely. He did cry a quite a bit, but they expected that to get better as he adjusted to not being held as much.

My husband and stepson talked to Amanda and she said that they realized that they can't afford daycare. They already made the 'easy' changes (packing a lunch, giving up fancy coffee, etc) and his dad and her mom are both giving them about $100/month towards childcare and they can barely afford it, but they didn't realize that you have to send everything the baby needs.

I buy diapers, wipes, formula, bottles, extra clothes etc. They just hand me the baby. They didn't realize that daycare didn't cover all that.

Also, imagine her boyfriend's surprise when he found out what the staffing rates are in this very expensive daycare. 1 adult cares for 5 infants. I guess he thought that someone would provide one-on-one care, diapers, wipes and formula for $350/week.

My stepson relayed their almost apology. They felt overwhelmed by an infant and couldn't imagine that someone else could manage that plus other things.

Cullen is going back to daycare tomorrow. Cullen's dad is selling his dirt bike and Amanda is selling some designer clothes, handbags and shoes to cover the cost. It'll get easier for them in 6 months when he transfers to the 1 year old class, which is a little cheaper.

*I love how Amanda’s boyfriend was shocked to find out that daycare isn’t a magical babysitting fairyland. Newsflash: diapers don’t grow on trees, buddy*



**grayblue\_grrl**

*Wonder if he is EVER going to apologize for being an absolute idiot. What a moron.*



**Top\_Put1541**

*No, he'll likely get Amanda pregnant again inside a year because he literally cannot connect cause and effect and neither can Amanda.*



**engine089**

*Amanda and her boyfriend needed to realize that parenting comes with sacrifices.*



**bippityboppitynope**

*NTA.*

*Gee, things cost money and babies are a lot of work. Boyfriend is a flaming idiot who killed the golden goose. He has no idea the favor you were doing them and he is a shitty person.*

*My bestie owned a daycare pre covid and our kids went to her. Even with the friend discount it was 375 a week because we had 3 kids there, 2 full time and one before and after school. She is a fucking angel for discounting it so much. In our area that usually would be 2.5 times that much and we couldn't afford it. I thanked her constantly. I made sure our diapers and wipes were stocked plus extras just to be safe. I sent snacks for all the kids when I could. I brought her bottles of wine. Because that is how you treat someone doing you a huge favor. With gratitude.*

*Her boyfriend is too stupid to breed. Sad she figured that out too late.*

*My mom babysits for free for us to have dates. We have 5 kids still at home (blended family) so as you can imagine babysitters are hard to come by and cost a lot. I got my mom a massage envy membership to say thank you and regularly my husband does stuff at her house she needs help with. Because we appreciate the fact people help us with our kids. They do not have to.*



**ValleyOakPaper**

*Amazing how there is zero drama when you show your appreciation for people who do you favors. You know, instead of slandering them on social media.*



**No\_Abroad\_6306**

*Killing the golden goose is a great way to describe this level of idiocy. What happens when they run out of stuff to sell? Because “little cheaper” at the daycare is still >> than free.*

* Stay *very* organized; our DOC got sick the night before our wedding and had to call in a (very competent) replacement. She was easily able to review all of the spreadsheets, timelines, and diagrams that I'd provided to the original DOC. I planned [everything out in Notion](https://imgur.com/a/XtIYfcn) to *extreme* levels of detail.
* We weren't sure if we'd hit a snag with having a kid-inclusive wedding but they were A BLAST: they kicked off and sustained dancing throughout the night and loved all of the toys and coloring books we provided.
* Guests raved about the food, DJ, and bathroom baskets.
* I thought getting a shorter dress for the reception was a waste of money but I really wish I had gotten one anyway.

As an SD, you are aware that we get several PMs a week inquiring if we’re looking for an SB; most of them remote or distant, foreign, scammers, or people trying to sell content. 

We moved the conversation to a messaging app, and I quickly determined she was real and genuine so we kept in touch, flirted, shared experiences, etc., until this afternoon when we had a MG. 

I entered  the coffee shop and immediately saw her. She walked to me and said, “I know you!” We hugged, got past the awkward stage, which took 15 seconds, and retreated to a corner table after we were served. 

We had an honest conversation about what we are looking for, our relationship situations, work schedules, etc., and held hands, snuck a kiss here and there, and at my suggestion, sat in my car for a few minutes for a bit more “privacy,” although being parked facing a busy boulevard with the sun beaming through the windshield was not optimal for a few extended kisses, we made it work, and we can’t wait to get to the good stuff because the chemistry was great.  

She mentioned that she had a nail appointment following our meeting so I picked a card up on the way and put (what I think) was enough money to cover the mani. 

A few more deep kisses were enjoyed, and she playfully grabbed my hand and placed it under her shirt on her breast…and I was super OK with that.

Teeth whitening has become increasingly popular, offering a quick and effective way to achieve a dazzling smile. However, many people find themselves wondering about post-whitening care, especially when it comes to their beloved morning coffee. Understanding the delicate process of teeth whitening and its aftermath is crucial to maintaining those pearly whites. Coffee lovers often worry about potentially undoing their professional whitening treatment or causing new stains immediately after the procedure. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about when and how to safely enjoy your favorite caffeinated beverage after teeth whitening.

Understanding Teeth Whitening and Coffee Sensitivity

After a teeth whitening treatment, your tooth enamel becomes temporarily more porous and sensitive. This means that immediately after the procedure, your teeth are more susceptible to staining and discoloration. **Dental professionals recommend a strict waiting period** before consuming dark-colored beverages like coffee.

Key Waiting Periods for Coffee Consumption

1. Immediate Post-Whitening Period (0-48 Hours)
- Absolute no-coffee zone
- Teeth are most vulnerable to staining
- Stick to clear liquids
- Avoid any colored foods or drinks

2. Short-Term Waiting Period (48-72 Hours)
- Minimal coffee consumption
- Use a straw if you must drink coffee
- Rinse mouth immediately after drinking
- Choose lighter-colored beverages

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

The Science Behind Teeth Whitening and Staining

When you undergo a teeth whitening procedure, the treatment opens up the pores of your tooth enamel, making them more receptive to staining agents. Coffee contains intense color compounds called tannins that can quickly penetrate these open pores, potentially reversing your whitening results.

Factors Affecting Coffee Consumption After Whitening

Several factors influence how long you should wait before drinking coffee:

- Type of whitening treatment used
- Individual tooth sensitivity
- Professional vs. at-home whitening
- Personal oral hygiene habits

Recommended Waiting Times by Treatment Type

Professional In-Office Whitening
- Minimum waiting period: 48 hours
- Ideal waiting period: 72 hours
- **Most sensitive teeth whitening method**
- Requires strictest post-treatment care

At-Home Whitening Kits
- Minimum waiting period: 24-36 hours
- Less intensive treatment
- Slightly more flexible restrictions

Tips for Coffee Lovers Post-Whitening

1. Use a Straw
- Minimizes direct contact with teeth
- Reduces potential staining
- Helps protect your new white smile

2. Rinse Immediately
- Drink water after coffee
- Use a pH-neutral mouthwash
- Helps neutralize acidic effects

3. Consider Alternative Beverages
- Herbal tea
- Water
- Light-colored drinks
- Temporary alternatives during recovery

Potential Risks of Premature Coffee Consumption

Drinking coffee too soon after teeth whitening can lead to:
- Immediate staining
- Reduced whitening effectiveness
- Increased tooth sensitivity
- Potential long-term discoloration

Professional Recommendations

**Dental experts consistently advise patience** after teeth whitening. While the temptation to enjoy your regular coffee might be strong, waiting 48-72 hours can significantly improve and maintain your whitening results.

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Long-Term Maintenance Tips

To preserve your white smile while enjoying coffee:
- Use whitening toothpaste
- Regular dental check-ups
- Consider professional cleaning
- Moderate coffee consumption
- Practice good oral hygiene

When to Resume Normal Coffee Drinking

After the initial waiting period, gradually reintroduce coffee:
- Start with lighter roasts
- Use a straw
- Rinse thoroughly after drinking
- Maintain good oral hygiene

Conclusion

Navigating the post-teeth whitening period requires patience and careful consideration, especially for coffee enthusiasts. By following professional guidelines and understanding the science behind tooth sensitivity, you can enjoy both a bright smile an",1,1736379913.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

Cocktail waitresses were around within the first half hour, I was served 4 different times until I busted out in 14th. I drank coffee and juice, was surprised to see so few drinking alcohol even though this was a morning game.  

I got some cards early and took a few nice pots and played tight, but did not take advantage of the rebuys, which they did not advertise overhead.  I wasn’t looking at the time and forgot.  

The blinds increase so much that after my 3rd table swap most hands have an all-in, and in hindsight I should’ve played more ace or king/blank hands.  I will say my instincts served me well and I not once missed an opportunity or got caught bluffing.

They paid top 9 that day and if I’d won one single hand late I would’ve cashed.

So me 18F got into a new college last year and i meet a guy (18M) at first i noticed how good he looks but not more. After a few months he changed his seat next to me and we starting talking so much almost immediately. We had so much in common to talk about. Sometimes He teases me friendly sometimes when we talk he forgets the things he had to do and when i buy something he buys the same thing. He always waits for me or even go late to class just to talk to me a bit more. He remembers the Things that i say and if im missing someting like my headphones he asks me about It, we are always talking and joking around class and he does not care if our arms or legs touch my accident.

When we eat he will give me from his food always and once i bought him lunch because He forgot his money and the next day he bought it for me without me saying anything. 
A few days pass and we were talking even more even on the phone to „study“ but we usually just casual talk, when we are in class sometimes i rest my hand on his leg or if i want to reach something and he does Not care. I also touch his legs when excited tell him about something and he does not mind it. He bought me a bunch of snacks and food and complimated my grades in school. We were the whole day together i was even at this dentist appointment and he told me he appriciated my company. We Joked the whole day and i gifted him a self made bracelet that he had on, on top of his jacket so it was visible and he got extremly happy when i told him it was for him. After the day we spend a few minutes at his Home and then i got Home and he sleept the rest of the afternoon.
And when we were studing at a backery we had a friendly fight over who pays because i wanted to pay for him and make him happy with a coffee when we got to study he said „who cares about this anyways i just want to talk to you“ and i got really red.
One thuesday we had an exam and he didnt show up, i was really nervous the whole day because we studied so much so after school i got to his Home and his neighbor woke him up, he came to the door with a tank top showing his extremly good looking Body i got really red and told him i was so worried he didnt show up. He, half asleep, invited me in and prepared coffee for us two he was reaaaally sleepy and it was so cute. After talking the whole morning we decided to go to his doctor so he can say he was sick that day. After that we got to the supermarket and grabbed few things to eat and we were back at his Home were i meet his mother. She cared about me and he already told her about me but they she had to go. He laided on his bed and i sat Next to him using his body as my back support. He turned on some music and i kind of played a bit with the pillows while he was just smiling at me laying down. Then he told me that it was late and i had to Go Home so i told him „make me“ and we had a playfull fight then he grabbed my body and got me outside we said bye and I got home.

After that day we been talking about it and he really liked that i cared so much about him and even told me to plan a sleepover at his House! (Only us two) in class we had gifts for others and i told him that i have something for him later, after class he was very hungry so i took him to my favorite local Restaurant and he ate my favorite dish and drink and he loved it! He said he needed to come again because it was so tasty then i gave him a gift, a 20€ steam gift card and a drawing i made of us two hugging taggeled up in christmas lights he really loved the gifts and i gave him drawings of us before and he already has a Special Place in his room for them. We ate joked around and even drank a bit we spended so much time together and he even told me to try out his ring because he tought it was funny that my hands were way smaller. This time he also asked me about my past relationships and how or why it ended. Then i took him home and i got home after.
Once, going home we both sang birds of a feather by billie eilish and i told him i love that song and he does too.

A few weeks going on a trip to Spain for the Winter vacations and hes been asking for updates If im still at the airport or If im there, i sended him a pic of the airport on 4 am and the anwerserer right away and then told me He was going to sleep. His Last Message was ""good morning ☺️"" because is not night anymore lol 

And our teacher said when we come back from the holidays our class planned to go ice skating, he knows how but i dont so he must help me (he offered his help). 

Then he sundely invited me over to new years eve and when i came we were 4, 2 his friends. And i gave him the gifts that he loved, i also brought my camera and i made pics of him and then told me to pose and take a pic of me. He also loved my outfit and he remembered my neclace. He was always cheeking on me anda offering tee and food. He even said He had gifts for me but because i gave him more he nows has to plan more. When i had to go he told me to take pics together alone with the camera and i went home.

Yesterday we had school together and its been pretty chill we worked together in proyects and then we cooked together at his home and we ate on the bed cuddled up under the sheets on his bed while watching marvel, adventure time and even sausage party 😳 i was cuddled up next to him i could sense he was a bit nervous but didnt want me to go  then we play fighted and cuddled a bit more and i headed home
When i had to go he also invited me to sleepover one day so its clear he liked it.

He has been my loyal companion, a true talker and lover, and a constant source of warmth and joy in my life. However, since having my child, I’ve noticed that he hasn’t been the same, and I truly believe he would thrive in a different environment—one where he feels completely at ease and cherished.

He needs a home with no children, where he can relax and feel secure. He’s a sucker for soft fleece blankets and could spend hours perched at a big window, soaking in the sights. His sweet personality and love for conversation make him the perfect partner for someone seeking companionship and comfort.

Finding him a new home is one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever had to make, and I will only let him go to someone who will offer him the warm, safe, and loving environment he deserves. If you can provide a calm, child-free space where he can thrive, please reach out. I want him to find not just a new home, but the right one.

Thank you for understanding how much this means to me—and to him. ",11,1736378535.0,ChicagoNWside,1,1.0,False

This is what Pinterest and AI think of me based on the following prompt words (the same ones that u/MiniaturePhilosopher used in their original post): 

animal, season, planet, plant, place, color, hobby, food, coffee, and character 

Personally, I see a lot of soft, blended colours and a cozy nature vibe, as well as some colourful quirks and themes of existential exploration. I think I seem drawn to the quaintness of everyday comfort as well as ambling aesthetically through life thinking. 

ChatGPT's words to describe me based on the contents of the photo: 

""Overall, you come across as someone who finds beauty in both the big, cosmic questions and the small, everyday moments. You are a mix of a wanderer, a romantic, and a deep thinker, appreciating art, nature, and the stories that make life meaningful.""

\- Nostalgia (you lean towards peace, beauty and simplicity, the charm of the past) 

\- Serenity (a calm, grounding energy) 

\- Wonder (found both in grand cosmic matters and small everyday ones) 

Collage Title: ""A Quiet Soul's Odyssey"" 

I really love this title! I feel like it emphasises the importance of small, everyday comforts and personal little steps of growth towards something greater.

Drop a picture (or describe their art style),"Not all of my OCs are artistic talents, but I think the way they draw themselves definitely shows a bit of their own personality. I've drawn how some of my OCs draw themselves (their drawing on the left, OC on the right ALWAYS) because 1. I love trying new art styles and 2. It helps me make my OCs more ""whole"" in a way!

How does your OC draw themselves? If you have any pics, drop them here, if you don't describe their art style!! I'll describe their art styles below (and how they relate to their personality), so the next few paragraphs will be some good ol' yapping, feel free to use it as a base to describe your OC's art style. I hope this isn't considered ""low effort"" bc I actually spent 3 days prepping for this post alone 😭 to make it more of an interaction, I'll share what I think your OC's art style would be like (of if it fits what I had in mind upon seeing them) :]


✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦✦


Simon (blond chubby dude, born in 2001) - slides 2-4 - his style is HUGELY influenced by 2010s cartoons, like Steven Universe, Bee and Puppycat, Adventure Time, Gravity Falls, etc. It has mostly round shapes with few edges. When he draw himself, he tends to make himself ""look better"" since he's very self-conscious about his looks. Colors are typically light and saturated, with a huge use of cyan and teal as a tint. He IS canonically a digital (occasionally traditional for sketching) amateur artist, but doesn't have much time to practice so most of his art is unfinished. Canonically, he is a PNG-tuber occasionally: most of his videos have very little editing (educational programming content), and on livestreams he uses his face sometimes, but when he's too embarassed to appear face-to-camera or when he's motivated to edit his videos, he uses PNG-tuber avatars he drew. Sometimes he warns his audience when he's gonna use the PNG-tuber avatar, specially when it's on a livestream considering the ""default"" is not using it (tho at this point he uses the avatar more than he appears on camera)

William (emo dude with deep sadness in his eyes, born in 1997) - slides 5-7 - he is canonically an animation meme kid and had a youtube channel where he makes such vids. He is largely influenced by the 2000s emo art style with jagged lines and lots of geometry. Much like Simon, he conceals his imperfections when drawing himself, particularly his height (he has gigantism). He has a sona character (yes, my OC has an OC!) who is a ""frankenstein-type"" stitched up circus monster, since people bullied him a lot calling him a freak/monster before, so his sona reflects that. Mostly his art has desaturated tones, mostly black, gray and white, sometimes purple. Draws digitally with his phone, or traditionally. The proportions are slightly chibi-like.

Oscar (canonically anorexic guy with sparkly earrings, born in 1998) - slide 8 - He is self taught and learned art exclusively to be able to design his own clothing. His art style is amateur, HIGHLY sharp/angular looking with very little curves, and heavily inspired by fashion sketches/croquis. He is a traditional artist, doesn't often color his work, but when he does, it doesn't have any color preference: he colors things as the color it would be in real life with no stylization. Sketchy due to not being very confident in his lines yet, he can't draw faces well as his main concern is bodily form (wow, it's exactly like he thinks about himself in real life! Insane parallel!). When drawing himself, he doesn't draw himself sickly thin, as he truly doesn't think he is thin as he is, and the longs limbs are inspired by fashion silhouettes. (Due to the image I used I have to specify Oscar is actually light brown with black hair and black eyes, he is NOT blue 😭 I just like to use a blue color palette, but he has a natural human skintone, he isn't a Smurf y'all 😭 so many people actually think he is blue I have to specify)

Henka (fiery red head soldier, born in a medieval-like setting) - slide 9 - Very sharp and highly amateurish, but full of energy. He isn't good at drawing mostly due to never practicing at all, but he enjoys making his depictions of himself every now and then. Very sharp, very edgy, slightly wonky, but a perfect reflection of his personality tbh. Would do art in whatever supply he had in hand, and if colors are available, he will choose the strongest, most saturated hues.

Jack (40 year old soldier with buzzcut, born in medieval-like setting) - slide 10 - simple, clean, slightly amateurish as there's been a while since he practiced. Minimalist and a little old-timey, with lots of curves and thicker lines, looks like something you'd  see drawn in coffee foam, a reminder of simpler times. Draws himself younger, as that's what he misses the most, a time in his life when he had the opportunity to learn to draw and worries weren't anywhere as severe. His art hasn't evolved since that time, it's like a little time capsule. He never colors his art other than tones of the supply he is using (basically varying the opacity of the pencil or paint). (His real color palette is black hair and mid-tone black skin with green eyes)

Coraline (redhead scene queen, born in 1995) - slide 11 - HEAVILY based on the emo and scene art style of the 2000s. Very scratchy and sketchy since she doesn't draw often, and when colored, it's always in shades of white, black and super saturated neon colors (usually highlighters).

Dmitri (long-haired bleach blond, androgynous looking dude, born in 1920) - slides 12-13 - he is legally blind, so the best sketch he can make is a guess based on what he thinks he looks like, and what he can feel in the paper, since not a single line is visible to him. Never draws anything or learned how to, for obvious reasons.",12,1736378139.0,OriginalCharacter,28,1.0,False

1hwy18z,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1hwy18z/my_experience_with_sabroxy_and_dopaminergic_stack/,My experience with Sabroxy and dopaminergic stack.,"Negatives: increases my tinnitus, makes me feel somewhat drunk but not exactly uninhibited, just inebriated, makes me rock back and forth a little, and hands get cold (which is expected).

I do get noticeably more focused and fast but at the same time takes away some of the motivation from the rest of my stack, it's like I'm fast but everywhere, not fast and organised like on methylphenidate.

Two hours later the hands warm up, which is when I know the effects are wearing down. 60mg seem to be the golden spot, but I feel like the curve is too steep for some reason, I feel it hit quite hard after just 15 minutes and then go down very fast, I wish there was some way to prolong the release without losing too much bioavailability. 

There is unfortunately a bit of confusion to it, it doesnt allow my conscious thinking to ""connect the dots"" too well, on the other hand it enhances subconscious processes a lot, its almost as if I'm writing this without thinking and comes easily, on the other hand if I want to say something more than what is being typed I need to really try hard. 

I saw studies about how it reduces manic behaviour but it actually seems to give me manic behaviour, its like I want ""something"" all the time. be it water, chocolate, soda, coffee, gum, walking, sex, etc... also makes me really sleepy, but coffee (which is not usually enough) solves that. It is really interesting, and it doesnt make me feel too bad, I feel better and ""safer"" on it than 4-DMA for an instance but idk if I am really more productive, even when fast and focused indeed. Feels way more ""recreational"" than methylphenidate.

My current daily stack:

150mg - Berberine phytosome formulation (1:1:1:1 berberine/cream of tartar/faba protein/lecithin) (37.5mg)

1mg of Lithium Orotate powder (40ug elemental lithium)

200mg Jiaogulan

1g Taurine in the morning + 2g with the first dose of Sabroxy

5x60mg Sabroxy every 2 hours from 10am

150mg Schisandrin 4% (8mg)

40mg Nobiletin 30% (12mg)

I started on nootropics by taking Berberine because I was having 8 coffees a day but was still very sleepy and it did work as an wakefulness promoting substance, but I lacked motivation and was a bit anxious, so I added Jiaogulan and Lithium Orotate, which fixed each respectively. Still, was missing focus, so I separately tried catuabines (20mg) and pterostilbene (10-100mg), I tried specially hard to stick with the latter but both just gave me panic attacks and it was horrible. Then I tried 4-DMA, which is pretty good but not exactly for focus, it does make me more productive and fast, also recalling everything with precision, but it makes me feel quite weird, as in at the same time I get clarity of thought I also get almost paranoid and extremely uninhibited without inebriation, almost like a truth serum. If I go over the ideal dosage for me (0.5mg-1mg) I start to get massive dry mouth and jaw clenching, is it somehow also SNRI??

So, here I go again…I’m a 54 single Male from NYC looking for friends (male and female) from age range 30’s and up. Ideally in NYC or nearby to meet up mostly on weekends for either a coffee and talk, some hiking, listen to some live music, attend an event, volunteer in some charitable events, libations at a bar and talk/enjoy the ambience, a fine cigar and talk once in a blue moon (don’t smoke that often), read some books and discuss, take pictures, talk on ideas: philosophy, spiritual life/faith, family, on living, and open to some physical activities as well.

About me:  I’m a mix of a shy / a little bit of a charmer / a little dorky, and still have a bit of the night owl in me but also have learned to be a morning person. For those that know me long, I’m a loyal friend, a good listener and will be honest if you ask my advice. My loves are music (jazz,blues,rock from all eras,classical,world music,classic soul / r&b mostly from 60’s,80’s and some pop to give some examples), faith & spirituality (for those that want to I also like talking about this, but don’t mind at all for those that don’t care to talk about it either), tennis (just casual not competitive these days and am curious about pickleball for any that play), and more. 

Just message me here and I’ll respond.

I’m just as interested in him, but he makes it sound like I’m practically his girlfriend already he’s so invested in me. What if he isn’t, and he’s just as invested in anyone else as he acts with me? Are my feelings valid, or am I being silly? 

—— 

Hey y’all! I’ve been on Bumble for about a month or so and I’ve talked to a handful of guys, but there’s this one guy (25M) who I’ve been texting for a few weeks who I (26F) have a lot of chemistry with, and our mutual interest in one another has grown very strong over time. Our texts look like just walls after walls of text and photos back-and-forth, like we just have so much in common and so much to talk about! Despite him wrapping up med school and getting ready to earn his MD while applying for residency, his communication has been very consistent and thoughtful. There’s been a couple of times where he got really tied up by interviews, and I brought up that his busyness doesn’t discourage me from being interested in him and that if he ever feels guilty about not getting to respond to me for a day to please not feel sorry. He reassured me right back, saying that he really appreciated it and that he’s super supportive of my career path and taking space or time to myself when I’d like. We both reassured each other that there’s mutual support between us. 

We were really eager to go on our first date since the holidays are over and he had come back from visiting his family, so we finally went on our first date Saturday. Long story short, we had the same energy in person that we had over text — just going on nerdy rants and raving about so many topics and stories and opinions, just everything! When we were wrapping things up, we talked about our intentions with one another and we both agreed that we were looking for something serious. We both hugged at the end of the night, and we touched base later on how we had such an incredibly fun night together, and how we can’t wait for next Friday to see each other again for coffee. 

But there’s this tiny part of me that’s just mystified by all of this, how strongly he seems to feel about me. I’m basically wondering if it would be unnecessary to ask if he really means what he’s saying to me, because he sounds very subjectively interested in me, like I’m apparently his favorite person to text (as is he for me). He’s very flirtatious and charming, saying he should start charging me rent because of how much space I take up in his head, calling me “brain meltingly perfect”, and how he’s afraid he’s going to become “accidentally obsessed” with me because of my incredible laugh and how intelligent and gorgeous I am. 

Yes, ofc I’ve been screaming like a little fucking fangirl on the daily lmao, but I can feel myself developing feelings for him with all of this mutual attraction. And although I’m still sorta talking to other guys, how this guy communicates with me makes me feel like he’s invested in me, and maybe even only me. It makes me wonder if he’s doing the same as well, like still dating around and talking to other people and such. He’s making me feel like he holds me in very high regard so far and may want to pursue something more in the near future. 

But I keep thinking: what if he’s like this with everyone? I really don’t think I’d like it if he’s giving that same energy to everyone he’s talking to, you know? Is that wrong of me? Part of me wants to casually bring it up in like some lighthearted banter type of way, but I also think it’s really none of my business at the end of the day because we’ve been talking for a little less than a month and we literally just went on our first date lol. But on the other hand, the way he’s been treating me this whole time makes me feel like I’m like the only one he’s interested in, like he might be putting me on a pedestal. Idk, I can’t tell if I’m justified in my feelings or if I’m just insecure and it’s all the early infatuation stage of dating. Please keep in mind it’s been quite a few years since I’ve put myself out there, and I’d love to hear what you guys have to say or how you guys would handle it. Also thank you for reading this whole thing, jeez LOL. ",1,1736377804.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

1hwxv53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Separation/comments/1hwxv53/realized_we_are_separated/,realized we are separated,"My wife of 27 years and I have had a rocky relationship on and off for several years. All sex and intimacy stopped about 12 years ago. Pecks, occasional brief hand-holding if I initiate, are the extent of our physical connection. There are also some issues: she has hoarding tendencies, no job, stays up late, sleeps in late, and mainly just watches TV. She doesn’t clean the house except for doing laundry and dishes. Reading through the r/separation sub, I realized that her and I are essentially separated—not through any formal process or acknowledgment, but in how we’ve been living our lives. She did have a brief emotional affair, meeting the person a couple of times before it ended.

I have been working on trying to fix things. I’ve gone to individual counseling, but she doesn’t want to go. I believe that she gets uncomfortable when they start holding her accountable for her actions and such.

Given the current situation, I’ve asked her to get a job and start paying for some of her debts and help out with bills. She always has excuses for why she can’t work. My dilemma is that as long as I felt my needs were being met, I was fine fully financially supporting her. However, I feel that if all I am is an ATM, then she needs to step up and start paying for some of her own expenses.

We do seem to get along as long as we stay away from any serious topics, like sex or finances. I’ve been trying to reconnect by going out with her more—dinners, movies, and other activities—as we have drifted apart over the years, basically living separate lives.

Reflecting on our relationship dynamic, I’ve noticed that her anger or irritation often sets the tone in the household. For instance, if someone is in the kitchen when she wants to make coffee, she’ll scoff and say, “What are you doing in here?” This creates an environment where it feels like everyone must adapt to her mood. Additionally, while I’ve tried to address these patterns gently, her responses tend to be dismissive or indifferent, leaving me feeling unheard and frustrated.

Despite the efforts I’ve made, I’m beginning to question whether we’re on the same page about rebuilding our relationship.

I did not have dental insurance, no one really taught me the importance of my teeth. I am 21 Yrs Old now, I have had a lot of work done but I am trying to ensure that my future is not filled with cavities.

I need advice as to if there is anything else I should be doing in my Oral Hygiene routine. I use Prevident 5000 before bed and in the morning, I always allow it to sit for at least 30 minutes. I floss at night and throughout the day after meals I swish with water and chew xytilol gum! My dentist told me that I do not really need to worry about using mouthwash but I usually use ACT once throughout the day.

I also used to drink sugary coffee everyday, I have cut that back totally because I am scared but in general is it okay to have a sweet treat or coffee once/twice a week as long as I follow through with my oral hygiene?

For months I have been talking with the guy. We go to the same gym and the first conversation started when he came to help me with my form and we ended up doing a whole session together and then became part time gym buddies. After he would sometimes invite me to get coffee or food. He would spend all day every day texting me too. When we were at the gym but not together he’d always be looking over at me and he’d smile and look away if I looked back.. when we did work out together he would always be touching me and was so flirty with me. 

I felt like he was interested but did think it was odd that he’d only ever invite me to hang out post gym session but i was just enjoying it for what it was. Just before Christmas we grabbed a drink and he joked about wishing there was mistletoe. He constantly tells me how good I look while I’m working out

Earlier today whilst we were working out a lady came over with a small child, looked at me before she pulled him over and kissed him then they chatted. When she left he casually dropped it in the chat that it was his wife and child. 

I feel a little like I’m overreacting but I’m kind of like…are you serious? Should I say something to him - or to her? Or do I just leave it? He never actually kissed me and we didn’t have a formal date.. just maybe 30+ coffee/food evenings. I knew he didn’t want anything serious because it was never more than that, but I can’t help but feel like he’s betraying his wife. Or am I overreacting and this is fine for him to be doing? 

**edit**
For clarification- especially upon hearing this man has a wife I will not be texting, working out with or going for any more dinners with him! I am not interested in coming between a marriage.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

My sister is somewhat mentally disabled and she’s around my age. My sister has the maturity of a young teenager and a low IQ. She can drive and hold down a very basic job. She has a lot of weird anxiety issues. She has issues with her perception of the world and people. She has issues interacting with people. She doesn’t have much logic or common sense. 

My mom is early seventies. My mom has a college degree from a pretty respected university.

My dad died a few years ago. My sister has been living with my mom her whole life. My mom has been her caretaker her whole life. 

My mom seems to fancy herself smarter than everyone else and an advice giver. My mom hasn’t worked for about twenty years. 

My sister usually defers to my mom’s judgement but then she sometimes gets ideas and is very stubborn about them. My sister goes running to my mom if she encounters any trouble. 

If I’m in my mom and sister presence (they’re always together) I get aggravated because they bicker and argue. 

Both my mom and sister cut each other and me off when I’m speaking. But then my mom gets pissed off if she even senses someone is going to cut her off. 

My mom and sister always have better ideas or a better way to do something so even a simple outing turns into an argument. 

I wont go anywhere with them in the car. I rarely go anywhere with them. 

I tell them to not tell me what’s going on in their lives. 

I also avoid telling them what’s going on in my life because I don’t want advice or told how I can do something better.

If my mom or sister is on the phone with me both have a habit of listening to one side of the conversation and yelling in the background. My sister is the worst at this. I can’t talk to my mom on the phone and she isn’t yelling something she wants me to hear. 

My sisters idea of a conversation is letting your get half a sentence out, cutting you off thinking she knows what you’re going to say, trying to finish your sentence and getting it 100 percent wrong.

I try to help my mom and my sister when they need me but they don’t let me get a word of my mouth or finish a whole sentence or an idea. They always know better or they know what I’m thinking or they do something thinking that’s what I wanted without saying it. 

I try to help but I get so frustrated it’s not worth it. 

Getting in a car with them to get a coffee turns into a massive argument, debate, back and forth etc. It starts even before we leave just the text message saying “hey do you want to get coffee.”

I suspect my sister learned this behavior from watching my mom. 

Most of time after I hang up the phone or storm off in frustration I get an apology an hour or a day later.",0,1736377306.0,AITAH,1,0.33,False

Some advanced models even come with smart features, allowing you to track expiration dates or optimize energy use.

### Stove and Oven

A reliable stove and oven combination is vital for cooking a wide variety of meals. Whether you choose a gas or electric model, look for one that offers multiple burners and oven settings.

The microwave is a game-changer for busy families or anyone looking to save time. It’s perfect for reheating leftovers, defrosting frozen food, and even cooking quick meals. Look for features like pre-programmed settings for different food types and sensor cooking, which automatically adjusts cooking times based on moisture levels.

### Dishwasher

Cleaning up after meals can be time-consuming, making a dishwasher an essential appliance. A good dishwasher not only saves you time but also conserves water compared to washing dishes by hand. When choosing a dishwasher, consider its capacity, noise level, and energy efficiency ratings to find one that meets your needs while fitting your kitchen's layout.

For smoothie lovers or anyone who enjoys making soups and sauces, a high-quality blender is a must-have.

This appliance can help you create healthy drinks and easily blend various ingredients.

### Food Processor

A food processor is incredibly versatile and can drastically reduce your meal prep time. It can chop, slice, dice, shred, and even puree foods, making it easier to prepare vegetables or create sauces. If you cook regularly, investing in a food processor can simplify cooking tasks and allow you to experiment with new recipes.

### Coffee Maker

If you're a coffee enthusiast, a reliable coffee maker is a kitchen essential. From single-serve machines to traditional drip coffee makers, there are countless options available.

### Toaster or Toaster Oven

Whether you prefer crispy toast or you need an appliance to reheat leftovers, a toaster or toaster oven is ideal for quick meals. A toaster oven can offer more versatility, allowing you to bake, broil, and toast all in one appliance. Keep an eye out for adjustable temperature settings and timers to suit your cooking needs.

When choosing kitchen home appliances, consider your cooking habits and the size of your kitchen.

### Smart Ovens

Imagine an oven that can adjust itself according to the recipe you are using. Smart ovens come equipped with Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing you to control them via an app on your smartphone. You can preheat your oven while still at the grocery store, set timers, or check the cooking progress from anywhere in your home. Some models even offer voice-command features, making it easier to multitask while cooking.

### Multi-Cookers

Multi-cookers serve a variety of functions including pressure cooking, slow cooking, and sautéing.

Cutting vegetables by hand can consume a lot of time. This is where food processors shine. With different attachments, they can chop, slice, shred, and even knead dough. In just seconds, you can have perfectly diced onions or a pizza dough ready to go. Their ability to handle labor-intensive tasks makes them a must-have for any home cook looking to save time in the kitchen.

### Blenders and Smoothie Makers

If you love smoothies, an efficient blender can change your morning routine. High-power blenders can crush ice and blend tough ingredients seamlessly.

### Induction Cooktops

Induction cooktops offer quick heating and precise temperature control. Unlike traditional gas or electric cooktops, induction uses magnetic fields to directly heat your pots and pans. This method not only cooks food faster but also keeps your kitchen cooler. Additionally, induction cooktops often come with safety features such as automatic shut-off, making them suitable for households with children.

### Instant Pots

The Instant Pot has become a kitchen phenomenon for a reason. This electric multi-cooker combines the functions of a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, and steamer, all in one appliance. It can drastically reduce cooking times, allowing you to enjoy meals that might typically take hours in just a fraction of the time. Plus, with proper recipes, you can create flavorful one-pot meals with minimal cleanup.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/kitchen-home-appliances  
  
### Dishwashers with Smart Features

Modern dishwashers have evolved beyond just cleaning your dishes. Many now come with smart features, allowing you to start cycles remotely or monitor water usage through an app. Some models can even detect how dirty your dishes are and adjust the wash cycle accordingly. This innovation not only saves time but also optimizes water and energy use.

### Robotic Vacuum Cleaners

While not a kitchen appliance in the traditional sense, robotic vacuum cleaners can ease your kitchen cleaning routine. These little gadgets can navigate around your kitchen floors, picking up crumbs and dirt without requiring much effort from you. By keeping your kitchen floor clean, they help maintain a hygienic cooking environment.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/kitchen-home-appliances  
  
### Compact Refrigerators

For those with limited kitchen space, compact refrigerators can be a game-changer. These mini-fridges can store beverages, snacks, or leftovers without taking up much room. Look for options that offer adjustable shelves and energy-efficient designs, so you can optimize space and save on energy costs.

Investing in innovative kitchen home appliances not only enhances your cooking experience but also makes it more enjoyable.

1hwxojs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hwxojs/rotten/,Rotten,"This is not an intentional suicide note.

I’ve been up for 87 hours. The kind of wakefulness that’s so loud your thoughts echo off the walls of your skull. It’s not insomnia; it's a necessity. The caffeine, it’s… it’s the only thing keeping the engine running, and I’ve driven the thing straight into hell.

The first thing to go was my teeth. It started with little black lines at the base of my molars, like dirt shoved under fingernails. Then came the rot. I’ve seen apples left out on the counter longer than they should be—that’s what my smile looks like now. Brown, mushy spots where enamel used to be. And the smell? I’ve stopped talking to people just so I don’t have to see the recoil on their faces. Sometimes, I’ll catch a whiff of it myself when I’m sipping coffee, and it smells like meat left out in the sun. Rotten, sticky, rancid. My gums bleed every time I take a sip of something hot, but that’s just part of the routine now.

The real problem isn’t the teeth—it’s the cravings. I don’t think about food. I don’t think about sleep. I think about the next hit. The bubbling gurgle of a coffee pot is music to my ears, a Pavlovian trigger that sends shivers down my spine. It doesn’t matter if it’s sludge scraped from the bottom of a gas station carafe or a canned espresso shot I found half-crushed in a dumpster—I’ll drink it. God help me, I’ll drink it.

A few nights ago, I stumbled into a gas station at 2 a.m., looking like I’d just crawled out of a grave. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold the coffee cup, spilling hot liquid onto the counter. The clerk looked at me like I was some kind of animal. Maybe I am. When I reached for the energy shots, my hand knocked over the entire display. He told me to leave. I begged him, I actually begged him for just one bottle. When he wouldn’t give it to me, I screamed at him. My voice cracked like dry wood, echoing through the empty store. I don’t even remember leaving.

I’ve started noticing things I can’t explain, things that don’t feel like hallucinations. Sometimes it’s small, like a metallic tang in my coffee that lingers even after I’ve rinsed the pot, or the faint aroma of burnt blood mixed with the steam. But last night… last night was different. I was staring into a mug, black as tar, the surface rippling with tiny oily swirls, when I noticed the color was off—darker, thicker. I tipped the cup slightly, and that’s when I saw it: streaks of red swirling into the black.

It wasn’t a trick of the light. It was real. My gums had been bleeding again, more than usual. As I sipped, I must’ve swallowed some, must’ve let it drip down into the mug. The taste was sharper now, salty and sour, like iron melting on my tongue. I tried to pour it out, but my fingers wouldn’t work right—shaking, sticky, weak. It took all my strength to wrench the cup from my hand, the handle leaving an imprint on my damp, pale skin.

When I dumped it into the sink, thick streams of coffee streaked with blood spiraled down the drain, catching in clumps on the metal grate. The sink filled with the smell—rotting, sickly sweet, a stench so powerful I gagged, tears streaming down my face as I clawed at my own gums, trying to stop the bleeding. But it didn’t stop. It never does.

I’ve started hoarding. The cabinet under my sink is full of expired instant coffee jars, cans of sugary energy sludge, and half-empty bottles of cold brew that smell like vinegar. I don’t throw them out anymore. I can’t. Even the sight of them comforts me, knowing they’re there if I get desperate enough.

And desperate doesn’t even begin to cover it. Last night, I did something I can’t stop thinking about. I was out of cash. No loose change for the vending machine across the hall. Nothing. I was pacing the kitchen, clawing at my scalp, when I remembered the coffee filter in the trash. It was wet, soggy, the grounds clumped together in a cold, slimy mess. I scooped them out with my bare hands and squeezed them into my mouth. The taste was indescribable—bitter, yes, but also sour, rancid, like something decaying. I gagged, but I didn’t stop. I couldn’t.

My skin reeks. Not like sweat, not like someone who needs a shower... it’s sour, it's acidic, like the inside of a trash can after it rains. My armpits, my neck, even my crotch—it all burns. The caffeine’s eating me from the inside out, sweating its way out through every pore. My fingernails are turning yellow. My toenails are brittle. I pulled one off last week without even realizing it was loose.

I’m sweating constantly. My skin sticks to my clothes, and the salt burns when it seeps into the cracks of my dry, peeling lips. My heartbeat is a machine gun, a relentless tattoo against my rib cage that keeps me on edge. Sometimes, it skips. Just stops for a fraction of a second before resuming with a vengeance. That’s when I think, This is it. This is where it ends. But it never does. I have learned that the human body can take so much punishment.

I think I’ve poisoned myself. There’s a pain in my gut that’s been growing for weeks, a gnawing, acidic ache that radiates into my back. The acid’s eaten through something important, I'm sure of it.  A constant churning, gurgling knot of acid and gas that won’t go away no matter what I do. Sometimes, I think I can feel it moving, like something’s growing in there. I’ve stopped looking in the mirror because my stomach is starting to bulge. It's not fat, because when I press on my abdomen, I feel something solid. A mass. Hard, immovable, and just wrong. A knot of caffeine-soaked bile twisting inside me like it’s alive.

I pissed blood this morning.

It wasn’t the first time, but it was the worst. The toilet bowl looked like someone had poured rusted motor oil into it. The pain was so sharp it doubled me over, and I sat on the floor for an hour afterward, trying to catch my breath. When I stood up, I saw the stains on my underwear—dark, red streaks... it looked like someone had slashed a knife across my bladder.

Do you know what I’m most afraid of? Not the heart attacks that linger on the horizon, or the seizures that might be brewing. I’m afraid of running out. I'm afraid of standing in an empty kitchen with nothing left to brew. The thought of being sober is more terrifying than death. I’ve considered… other options. Boiling tea bags and drinking the water like a shot. Scraping the inside of old coffee filters with a knife and swallowing the grounds dry. I’ve even eyed the powdered instant coffee at the bottom of a jar and wondered what it would taste like if I snorted it.

I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. The idea of stopping feels like staring into an open grave. I can’t sleep. I can’t eat. The thought of silence—the absence of that jittery hum rattling through my veins—terrifies me more than the pain, the blood, the rot.

Last night, I found myself in the kitchen again, staring at the sludge I’d squeezed out of another old filter. I don’t even remember walking there. My hands were shaking so hard I could barely keep the mug steady, and for a second, I thought about smashing it. Just throwing the damn thing against the wall and ending it all right there.

But I didn’t. Instead, I took a sip.

It tasted like dirt and regret. The texture was gritty, the kind of grit that sticks to your teeth long after you’ve swallowed. But it didn’t matter. It went down like all the others—burning, choking, filling the hollow space inside me that keeps getting bigger.

When I finished, I sat there for hours, staring into the empty cup, waiting for the next craving to kick in. I could feel my body breaking down in real-time. My fingers were cold and blue around the edges, my vision tunneled, but the caffeine kept my heart stumbling forward like a drunk.

I think it’ll stop soon.

Not the cravings—those won’t stop until I’m dead. I mean the machine inside me. The one keeping me upright. It’s been firing on fumes for days now, and when it finally gives out, I’ll collapse, I’ll puke up whatever sludge is still inside me, and I’ll disappear.

But until then, I’ll drink.",2,1736377252.0,nosleep,0,0.75,False

Last week I bought a Gaggia Classic Pro on marketplace and have been fighting it since. I didn’t realize at the time, as I’ve never owned an espresso machine before, but it was not well-maintained. I’m not sure if this is a normal or advanced amount of scale/rust/buildup, but I had to buy an impact driver to disassemble the boiler. One of the bolts is on so tight that I’ve stripped it internally. I am feeling very overwhelmed, but would like to get this damn thing working. 

I’ve ordered some things already from shades of coffee, but am now wondering if I need more. I’ve also ordered some cafiza and citric acid, but they haven’t arrived yet. Right now I have CLR and vinegar at my disposal, but won’t use them if you think that’s gonna fuck stuff up. 

Any videos or tips or whatever would be appreciated. I also needed to vent because like… how can you be so bad at taking care of your nice things? Or, is this normal and I’m stupid?",0,1736377220.0,gaggiaclassic,11,0.5,False

","I (F26) joined a very large company a few months ago and my old fling (M25) works at the same company. In my city alone there are 2000+ employees, so I didn’t think I would run into him. I don’t even work on the main corporate building, but it turned out he works on the floor above me.  

For background information, we were seeing each other for over a month roughly in mid 2023, but it was somewhat deep and going in a serious direction. That summer I wasn’t doing very well mentally, and I did not fully reciprocate the energy he gave to me. I just looked back at all texts, there were times I wouldn’t respond to him for a few days, and he made effort still and planned such cute and thoughtful dates. I didn’t even realise I wouldn’t respond for days, but I know that my depression was starting to get extremely bad. I ended up sending him a text ending it and explaining the reason for my depression (PTSD) and needing to pull back, but it was after I’d ghosted him for two weeks. I apologised for how I handled it as well, and he responded considerately and thoughtfully.

Going back to present day. In early 2024, he took me off of Instagram. I have found out now that he was in a brief relationship so that’s probs when he took me off. We ran into each other coincidentally in early December, and he looked extremely shocked and so was i. I just got nervous and left, so I texted him the next day saying it was nice running into him. We had a brief conversation and caught up a little bit, and then I suggested that if he’s comfortable with it, we could get a coffee during work one day. He agreed to it, and then said that maybe we could even hang out outside of work. I said that sounds good and told him my schedule, and then he just loved my message and didn’t respond. I followed up early this month asking if he was still interested in a coffee, and the next day we went to a nearby coffee shop together and chatted for a bit. He paid as well. 

I then sent him thanks for the coffee and over text explained that everything I sent in the initial text ending it was actually true, and apologised again for how I handled it. He said it was fine and he’s glad I’m doing better now, but then mentioned that he’s not really looking for anything right now. He said he’s still happy to hang out. I thanked him for his honesty and then he insisted not to feel awkward or bad about reaching out. Then we had a pretty funny and playful conversation, and then two days later, I offered him some dessert as I brought some treats from a recent vacation for my team. I thought he was just going to grab the treats from my floor and go, but he actually came and sat in the kitchen with some coffee, and made conversation with me for about 20 minutes or so.

Is there any chance we could re-kindle this? The delulu in me  thinks that he is being more playful and considerate than a friend (not close one imo). Also, the fact that he initially suggested we hang out outside of work, but then didn’t respond until I followed up a month later. I’d like to think that maybe he’s hesitant given what happened last time, and also maybe he is fresh out of a relationship (idk when it ended). But maybe he is truly not into me anymore and just give that as an excuse. 

This really sucks, he was actually one of the nicest guys I’ve ever dated, and I didn’t realise I was lucky to have him in front of me at the time. 

I don’t wanna over analyse his behaviour since we’ve reconnected, but should I just leave it in assume that I will never be anything between us again? Or does his behaviour suggest otherwise? ",1,1736377107.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

As a Serb, I really enjoy Turkish coffee and food, and many people from here travel to Turkey even though Greece is actually closer. It got me wondering: for the average Turk, is visiting Greek beaches something appealing, or is it less of a priority because Turkey already has such incredible beaches?

What’s it like living in a country with some of the world’s best beaches? Do you feel lucky, like you’ve won the lottery because you don’t need to travel far for a seaside holiday, or does it eventually get repetitive?

Just to clarify, I’m asking specifically about beaches and vacations, not travel in general since I know people everywhere have an interest in exploring different cities and cultures.

Do you think it’s worth the effort to get a visa or do you prefer some of your own beaches? And if not, how does it impact you, personally? ",3,1736377079.0,AskTurkey,10,1.0,False

	2.	Chapstick – IDK why, but I need lip balm on me at all times. Doesn’t matter if I’m wearing makeup or not, it’s a non-negotiable.
	3.	My cozy blanket – I have like five, but there’s this one that’s just perfect. I wrap myself in it whenever I need to zone out for a bit.
	4.	My favorite playlists – From chill vibes to pumped-up jams, these are my go-to mood boosters.
	5.	A cold iced drink – Doesn’t matter what time of year, if it’s iced, I’m happy. Could be tea, coffee, whatever.
	6.	Messy bun + mascara – When I can’t be bothered to do much but still wanna feel cute. Throw my hair in a bun, swipe on some mascara, and I’m good to go.

1hwxiou,https://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1hwxiou/questions_on_adjustments_based_on_age_and_ceiling/,Questions on adjustments based on age... and ceiling height,"I appreciate this community and the folks that give their advice. I am a long time lurker, and I think that this would be my 2nd post. Hopefully soon I'll be at a point where I can contribute vs just asking questions.

I was wondering if there are any adjustments that need to be made to the ketogains program to account for age. I'm a 49M, 6'4"", 250 lbs (245 pre-holidays). Last dexa in October had me at 31.9% bf, so I still have a long way to go.

For added context, I took a previous dexa Nov 2023 and made the following progress (265 lbs then) by following a ketogenic diet and stronglifts 5x5:

* Total mass down 18 lbs
* Fat mass decreased by 24.1lbs
* Lean mass  increased by 6.1 lbs

I have started ketogains 5x5 last November and workout 2-3x per week.

* Should I be putting in a high amount of whey into my ketogain coffee to account for my age? (40g?)
* Is espresso a good substitute for coffee? (I find coffee very addictive, but not espresso)
* For the 3x8 lifts, I find I don't recover enough and find it hard to complete. Should I be resting longer than 2mins? Or is the point to get to failure and I should just suck it up?

 I'm fortunate enough to have access to a power rack. I did have to get it shortened to fit into a room (\~81""). Because if the ceiling height, I had to make a couple of adjustments:

* Standing overhead tricep extension is now seated
* Standing overhead shoulder press is now seated

 Do I have to add anything to ensure that I haven't made things too easy (they don't feel easy)?

 I also noticed the calculation on the ketogains calculator assumed an RMR of 2015. I had a test done ('astronaut' helmet and everything) and got a result slightly over 2,100. I was heavier but less muscular when I did the test. Should I modify any of the macros as a result?

I do notice strength increasing faster than when I did the stronglifts 5x5. So I am grateful for this program being made available publicly.
