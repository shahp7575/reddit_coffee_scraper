I've been running on nothing but coffee for two days.,"Think it'll get to a point where it's not about making something ""good"" but finding that thing that makes your product so addictive that it doesn't matter how shit your service is people are going to want it?

 So many ways to exploit so many different people. Someone is just bound to figure out the way to make the max profit with that. ",1,1755606035.0,DumbThoughts,0,0.99,False

1mugpjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1mugpjt/trouble_with_espresso_volume_and_timing_help/,Trouble with espresso volume and timing. Help needed!,"I have a Sage Barista Touch and it previously worked as expected e.g., first drop of espresso starting on 8 seconds and getting around 40ml espresso from 18g coffee with 25 seconds brew time (fineness setting between 9-14/30 depending on the bean). 

However, I now have to set my machine to the lowest fineness setting (1/30) and the pour starts on 6 seconds and gives 80ish ml coffee with 25 second pour. 

I’m using the double shot basket which is what I’ve always used and tamping pressure is roughly the same as I’ve always done. Any ideas or tips welcome! Any parameters I can tweak to solve the problem? 

Thanks in advance! ",1,1755605692.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False

me: 25 year old works from home

you: literally anyone who knows tai chi

If you know anyone who would be willing please do comment. Maybe it’s your grandma or your neighbor or whoever!

Why you ask? I think it would be a beautiful way to bond with a stranger and learn something I have always wanted to learn. Hoping to foster some community and have a nice peaceful beautiful time and if this goes well, maybe it can become a recurring thing!

I will buy you a coffee too :)",1,1755605585.0,pittsburgh,0,1.0,False

All keys are global unless mentioned otherwise (they might still have region blocks for Russia/Belarus/China – ask and I'll double check).

**Looking for games on** [**my wishlist**](https://lestrades.com/@febrik/wishlist/Some)**.**

I've picked up almost all Humble/Fanatical-bundled games I'm interested in from the last years, but a few I'm still looking for are:

*9th Dawn Remake / Transistor / Super Blood Hockey / Lunacid / Warplanes: WW1 Fighters / Vampyr /* *Yaga* */* *Dark Pictures Anthology: Devil in Me /* *Achilles: Legends Untold / HeistGeist / Star Shelter / Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura / The Almost Gone / The Outer Worlds + DLC (not Spacer's Choice Edition / VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action*

I'm not very excited to trade my never bundled keys for keys from bundles (unless it's a great offer).

Only trading for Steam games or Steam gift cards (not interested in GOG/EA/PayPal/tf2/crypto).

All the coffee chain's salaried employees in North America are set to get the raise, the company confirmed to Business Insider. That's a change from previous years, when managers weighed in on how much of a raise their salaried direct reports got.

The 2% raise doesn't apply to hourly workers, such as store baristas. Bloomberg earlier reported on the raise.

My espresso all of a sudden started to taste very sweet [Bambino Plus and SGP],"I have a full hopper of quite medium to dark roast coffee beans from a local roaster. I was away for a week, and I think the hopper had some sun exposure whilst I was away as usually the sun hits it in the evening.

This morning I had my first coffee for a week, and my espresso tastes very sweet, almost unpleasant and makes me wretch at the end. Has something changed, or is that what rancid tastes like? 

Have a bambino plus and usual dosage is 18.5g in, 37g out. 10 second pre-infusion (until drips).

The label tasting notes are Dark Chocolate, Maple Sryup and Smokey.

1muglwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleDataStudio/comments/1muglwn/5_iptv_providers_i_tried_in_2025_and_my_honest/,5 IPTV Providers I Tried in 2025 (and My Honest Thoughts),"After too many nights falling down the “[**top rated iptv**](https://iptvmeezzy.com/)” rabbit hole and sampling almost every “[**best iptv trial**](https://iptvmeezzy.com/)” I could find, I ended up testing five different **iptv providers** over the past few months. If you’ve ever wondered which **iptv subscription 2025** is worth your time, here’s my no-nonsense, coffee-fueled review. All of these were tested on my Firestick and Android tablet—sometimes at the same time (don’t ask).

* * *

### 1\. [**IPTVMEEZZY**](https://iptvmeezzy.com/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (I went for the 3-month deal for a discount)
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (rare buffering, even during football matches)
    
*   **Personal notes:** I actually found this one via someone talking about their **iptv reseller** experience in a forum. Setup was surprisingly painless, and I was watching within ten minutes. I nearly got lost in the VOD library—there’s way more than I’ll ever watch. Not 100% perfect (a couple of channels glitched during a thunderstorm), but overall it’s been the least stressful.
    

* * *

### 2\. [**SolarWave TV**](https://SolarWave.com)

*   **Price:** $15/month
    
*   **Channels:** 38,000 live, 130,000 VOD
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (great for movies, but some sports channels lagged at night)
    
*   **Personal notes:** SolarWave gets points for a clean menu and fast channel switching. They offered one of the **best iptv trial** periods I found—no credit card needed. I liked their news section, but a few niche music stations were missing.

### 3\. [**EchoStream Pro**](https://iptvmeezzy.blogspot.com/2025/08/premier-league-2025-your-ultimate-iptv.html)

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 30,000 live, 97,000 VOD
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (occasional buffering on international channels)
    
*   **Personal notes:** EchoStream has a simple interface, which I appreciate. Their support replied to my emails within a day (a small miracle in the IPTV world). The VOD selection is decent, but not as up-to-date as the top two. If you’re into retro movies, you’ll find a lot to love.
    

* * *

### 4\. [**FrostFlex IPTV**](https://iptvMeezzy.com)

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 27,000 live, 80,000 VOD
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (some channels slow to load, but most worked fine)
    
*   **Personal notes:** FrostFlex was a bit of a wild card—I only tried it because of a friend’s **iptv reseller** link. Good for basic local TV and news, but I noticed the sports section was hit or miss. Their app worked okay on my phone, but crashed once on my smart TV.
    

* * *

### 5\. [**BluePulse Live**](https://meezzy.myshoplaza.com)

*   **Price:** $12/month
    
*   **Channels:** 19,000 live, 55,000 VOD
    
*   **Smoothness:** 6.5/10 (more buffering than I’d like, especially at peak times)
    
*   **Personal notes:** BluePulse is the budget pick. It’s fine for background TV or catching up on older shows, but don’t expect flawless live sports. The VOD is mostly older content, but it’s easy to browse.

My IPTV Takeaways for 2025
--------------------------

Testing all these [**iptv providers**](https://meezzy.myshoplaza.com) taught me a few things:

*   Don’t buy a year up front—always try the **best iptv trial** first.
    
*   “More channels” doesn’t always mean better—focus on what you’ll actually watch.
    
*   Not every **iptv subscription 2025** will be smooth during big live events, so backups help.
    
*   If you’re tempted by the **iptv reseller** side, remember you’ll be the one answering everyone’s tech questions (ask me how I know).",1,1755605413.0,GoogleDataStudio,1,1.0,False

However, I have always find making coffee at home to be a much inferior product, possibly due to my own skill but likely also the equipment I used.

I've been exploring which machines to buy and doing lots of research but I cannot for the life of me make a deicision. My budget is probably c. £200 and I've been considering The Gaggio Espresso Style, Casabrew CM5418 or the Delongi Dedica Arte (for the better milk frother).

All the research I do says they should have 9 bar etc. if using non-pressurised baskets which would be my intention. But I don't want to fiddle with all these mods and stuff on the machine... ais this really a big deal and if so what would you suggest?",1,1755605280.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

We both don’t drink, the last time I had alcohol would have been like half a glass of wine months ago, and he probably had 3 beers 1 month ago in vacation which is rare for him to even drink. 
We also don’t smoke or vape, I don’t even drink caffeine, he has one cup of coffee a day. 

We try to eat fresh, try to cook from scratch on the stainless steal and cast iron. We use mostly “natural” products, dare I say we don’t use deodorant, he uses a salt stick stone thingy. 
I hardly ever use tampons, for a while we were using Astro glide lube and regular condoms. The past few 2weeks (luteal, and period) haven’t used a condom and only used coconut oil. 
We sleep at least 7 hours a night have a very regular schedule and have little to no stress or financial stress. 

We’ve also only used condoms for 7-10 days around my ovulation time. And successfully avoided pregnancy for 10 months that way. 

Is there anything I should be doing to prepare my body? 
I should say I have regular cycles, and no underlying health conditions.

Should we buckle down and try to eat even more healthy and exercise regularly before ttc?

1muggyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjarouk/comments/1muggyk/bit_of_a_ramble_sorry/,Bit of a ramble - sorry,"At a loose end whilst having coffee (didn't have time to start my  new book - later!) I decided to dive further into my food tracking app, Nutracheck.

Specifically into the ""eating out"" section.

Oh. My. Gods.

I mean, I knew then, as I know now, that most food bought whilst out, isn't really healthy in any way, but I must have kidded myself for years, that it was only occasional, so you know, it didn't matter/count......I'd make up for it in some way by eating extra fruit/veg the next day or some such rubbish I told myself. Except it wasn't occasional. It was at least once a week, and every weekend.

I considered eating out to be a pleasure, and one I indulged in all too often - particularly to do with work.

Still, some of the Fat/ Saturated Fat/Carbohydrate and Salt figures I viewed this morning were terrifying.  Quite literally terror inducing.What was I thinking? What must my insides be like? My arteries?  All those years where my only exercise was running for a mode of public transport or shaking my booty to loud music. Where I didn't care overly much about nutrition (I do now!) - when you're young, you've got time, right?  Where my clothes size went up, down, up further, down, up still further.  You all know how this goes. Where if there was pizza left over from the night before, it made a nice morning snackette! Where a bowl of Special K (healthy right.....right?!...) was always improved - don't judge me - by some single cream poured over. Where the home-made wholemeal (healthy yeah!) bread was always improved with butter and cheese - and a tomato because, you know, healthy.  I fooled myself, because I told myself I didn't drink fizzy drinks, I didn't eat McDonalds, etc. etc.I KNEW none of this was good, yet I seemed powerless to make a difference.

Mounjaro has given me the space I needed to take that metaphorical step back. To stop the feeling of never being satisfied. To make better food choices all around (and yes, make every calorie count). To be, for the first time in many years, and to borrow from Gala's 1996 song,  ""free from desire"" for all the cravings.

TL:DR: Mounjaro rocks. It's changing my life through my health. Don't ever look up the eating out nutrional values unless seated with a cup of coffee in front of you. It's frightening.

The following screen capture from the Nutracheck app just shows what a McDonald's consists of - I did it just for my own information.

All I know is, I’ve literally never talked to a girl before (growing up environment was like that).

Now whenever I see girls, my brain goes: “Bro, write her a note saying she looks cute/gorgeous and ask her for coffee!”…then the other half of my brain goes: “Yeah, and what if her boyfriend WWE-slams you for it? Or she thinks you’re some creepy rom-com villain?”

So here I am, stuck between being Casanova with sticky notes and being a socially awkward NPC.

Serious question though: Would girls actually find a note like that sweet, or is it just creepy? Should I just skip the notes and learn how to talk like a normal human being?

Twins don't run in my family. These are identical and can apparently happen to anyone. Morning sickness is a nightmare and the smell of cooking meat and coffee make me gag. Yesterday, my husband reheated leftovers that, blindfolded, I would've identified as cat food.

This may sound silly, but with over 3 weeks until my next scan, how do I make sure they're both still in there? I'm freaking out about how to handle this, but any advice for staying calm? I Google too many things and the interwebs always show worst case scenario/all the possible medical issues.

Hot showers were my safe space sometimes I'd stay in there for 20 minutes just procrastinating on life.

But I kept hearing about the benefits, so I decided to torture myself for a month and see what happened.

Week 1: Pure agony. Not gonna lie, I screamed. Actual screaming. My body went into full panic mode every single time. I'd stand outside the shower for 5 minutes psyching myself up like I was about to jump out of a plane.

Week 2: Still terrible, but manageable. I stopped screaming but still did this weird breathing thing where I'd hyperventilate before getting in. Started with warm water, then gradually turned it cold. Baby steps.

Week 3: Something clicked. I started looking forward to the challenge. Weird, right? It became this daily test of ""can I do this hard thing?"" And every day I proved to myself that I could.

Week 4: Actually enjoying it. This sounds insane, but I started preferring cold showers. They felt... refreshing? Energizing? I felt like I could conquer anything afterward.

What changed beyond just shower temperature:

My confidence shot up. If I could handle 2 minutes of freezing water every morning, everything else felt easier. Difficult conversations, tough workouts, uncomfortable situations none of it seemed as scary.

My energy levels were insane. Cold water is like mainlining caffeine. I'd come out of the shower feeling more awake than after two cups of coffee.

I stopped avoiding hard things. The shower became practice for not backing down from discomfort. It spilled over into other areas I started having conversations I'd been avoiding, tackling projects I'd been putting off.

My mood improved. There's actually science behind this. Cold exposure releases endorphins and norepinephrine. Basically, natural antidepressants.

My biggest lesson was comfort is overrated. I'd been choosing the easy option in small ways all day hot showers, soft chairs, avoiding anything uncomfortable. Those tiny choices were making me soft everywhere else too.

If you want to try this start with 30 seconds at the end of your normal hot shower. Just turn it cold for the last bit. Build up gradually. Don't try to be a hero on day one.",29,1755604487.0,Habits,3,0.89,False
1muga0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterOpening/comments/1muga0e/delve_into_whether_tide_powder_detergent_truly/,Delve Into Whether Tide Powder Detergent Truly Preserves Colors,"The Tide P_15240 powder laundry detergent with bleach alternative lives up to its reputation as a powerhouse for cleaning clothes. I've been running it through its paces at home, and I must admit, this product manages to combine effectiveness with versatility in a way that’s hard to ignore. Tide has always been a household favorite, and with this particular product, they seem to have further cemented their status.

**Performance and Stain Removal**  
Laundry day used to mean battling coffee stains, spilled spaghetti sauce, and grass remnants on my kid’s jeans. With this detergent, stains don’t stand much of a chance. Its active enzymes claim to break down stains, and from my experience, that promise holds true. Grass stains from soccer practice disappeared faster than usual, and even the stubborn tea stains I usually struggle with came out without requiring multiple cycles. 

[Check Tide P_15240 price on Amazon.](https://go.senaar.com/p/b0dt2fnvwy/)  

**Color-Safe Brightening Power**  
What made this detergent stand out was how it cared for colored clothes. There’s always a bit of hesitation when using a detergent promising both whitening and color-care features, but the results were surprisingly good. I tried it on a bunch of both whites and mixed-color clothes. Remarkably, my whites didn’t look washed out, and my reds and blues retained their boldness over several washes. Knowing it doesn’t use chlorine bleach, I felt safe loading my more vibrant wardrobe pieces without the fear of ruining them.

**Ease of Use and Packaging**  
Handling this detergent is hassle-free. The box is sturdy, though it’s a little bulky to store if you’re tight on pantry space. However, given it handles 89 loads, I didn’t mind sacrificing a bit of shelf room for a product that lasts this long. The powder itself dissolves well in both cold and hot water cycles, leaving no grainy residue on fabrics post-wash. This was a relief compared to some other powders I’ve tried that clump up in the washing machine.

**Pluses**  
- Effectively removes tough stains, even without pre-treatment.
- Safe for both white and colored garments.
- Acti-Lift Crystals help maintain fabric brightness after multiple washes.
- A chlorine-free formula that’s gentler on fabrics and colors.
- Large capacity for numerous loads, making it economical in the long run.

**Pitfalls**  
- The sizable box can be a bit inconvenient to store in smaller spaces.
- Doesn’t come with a sealed liner inside, meaning you need to be cautious about spills.
- While powerful, it’s slightly less effective when using hard water.

**Key Benefits**  
The amount of thought put into this product's design and composition truly sets it apart. By tackling stains without relying on the harsh properties of traditional bleach, it feels modern, efficient, and thoughtful of today’s multifunctional laundry needs.

**Product Alternatives**  
In comparison to similar detergents such as Arm & Hammer Plus OxiClean Powder and Gain Original Powder, the Tide does a stellar job of standing out. Arm & Hammer handles tough stains well but doesn’t always keep colors as vibrant after several washes. Gain is known for its pleasant scent but lacks the robust whitening strength Tide provides. If scent variety matters to you, Gain has the edge, but for stain-lifting and color-saving properties in one product, Tide wins this round.

**Cost Efficiency**  
While Tide might seem pricier compared to generic brands, its performance justifies the tag. Each load feels like it’s stretching a long way, and fewer additional treatments or re-washes save both time and money. Investing in a detergent that can handle daily messes and maintain fabric longevity feels like a smart choice for families like mine.

# Colossians 3:1

* *Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.*

Every Christian should have an upward focus. If we believe in Christ, we are united with Him, and so Paul says, “Since you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is.”

Becoming a Christian makes us citizens of heaven. Though we still live in this world, our true home is above, where Christ is. The joy and life of heaven should be our joy and life.

“Your life is hidden with Christ in God.” This means we are safe in Christ and that our strength and help come from Him.

Our hearts and minds should be drawn away from earthly things toward heavenly things. We should live for what is above. Our minds should be set on heavenly things, not on the things of this earth.

While we remain here for a time, we are on our way to heaven, where we will live forever.",1,1755604444.0,EnlightenUp,0,1.0,False

1mug2a0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mug2a0/discover_if_the_aeropress_go_is_the_ultimate/,Discover if the AeroPress Go is the ultimate portable coffee maker review!,"The first time I got my hands on the AeroPress 15A01 and started testing this travel coffee press kit, I found myself savoring the fine balance between portability and functionality. AeroPress has a reputation for innovation, and this product upholds that legacy with its compact design and ability to brew full-bodied coffee without bitterness. This handy little guy quickly became my daily companion—not just for camping trips but for those ""office-in-the-park"" days too. Everything about this coffee maker screams convenience, which makes it quite appealing for those who love great coffee without the complicated process. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of this portable coffee press struck me immediately. Compact yet sturdy, it feels reliable even after daily trips in my slightly overcrowded backpack. The matte grey finish is understated but chic, and every component fits perfectly into the collapsible mug that doubles as a case. The setup includes well-thought-out pieces—a plunger, paper filters, stirring tool, and funnel—that all seem engineered to last. As someone who tests coffee makers a lot, I particularly appreciated the BPA-free and phthalate-free materials, which give health-conscious users extra peace of mind. At just 11.2 ounces, you can barely feel the weight in your bag. It's almost laughable how something so small can deliver high-quality coffee consistently.  

**Functionality and Features**  
This device is all about practicality. Brewing coffee with the AeroPress Go doesn’t require PhD-level skills. Honestly, if you’re capable of stirring and pressing, you’re overqualified. It’s designed to brew 8oz of coffee or 1-3 shots of espresso-style coffee in under a minute. Investing some trial and error into grind sizes, I found medium-fine grounds work best to prevent clogging the paper filter while still producing that smooth, rich flavor. The variety of brewing options surprised me. From classic hot coffee to cold brews in just two minutes, the flexibility is commendable. If you drink coffee like I breathe air, this becomes even more enticing. The process remains mess-free, and cleaning takes under 30 seconds—a blessing for anyone who loathes scrubbing coffee residue.

**Who Will Love This Coffee Maker?**  
This small but mighty coffee maker targets a specific crowd: coffee enthusiasts constantly on the move. Campers, hikers, travelers, and students (think late-night dorm coffee marathons) will all find an ally in this product. Working a remote gig myself, I needed something travel-friendly that wouldn’t sacrifice flavor. The AeroPress Go nailed it. Even at home, I’m reaching for this over my larger machine because it’s so easy to operate and produces remarkably smooth coffee. If you’ve ever struggled with bitter, gritty French press results, this coffee maker offers an excellent solution. 

**Positives**  
- Compact and lightweight design ideal for travel  
- Smooth, grit-free coffee that rivals much larger machines  
- Multifunctional: Espresso-style coffee, cold brew, and classic coffee options  
- Quick cleanup and faster brewing compared to traditional methods  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
While I adored using this coffee maker daily, a few quirks surfaced:  
- Built for single servings; not ideal for larger households or groups  
- The reliance on paper filters may not appeal to those preferring eco-friendly, reusable options  
- Produces a smaller quantity of coffee compared to some French press alternatives  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing the AeroPress Go to similar compact coffee press models, a few distinctions become clear. The Wacaco Nanopresso, for instance, also caters to travelers but feels noticeably bulkier. Wacaco excels in creating a true espresso experience, yet the AeroPress Go wins in versatility—I doubt any competitor beats it for cold brew creation in under two minutes. Fellow portable coffee makers, like those from Bodum, typically rely exclusively on the French press process, leaving behind grit that AeroPress avoids. From my observations, this compact press offers a more refined brew taste, making it better suited for those with picky palates.

**Money’s Worth**  
Without getting into exact price specifics, I’ll say that the AeroPress Go represents smart spending for its niche. Considering its adaptability and the level of quality it delivers on a consistent basis, it feels like a sound investment. Whether you're sipping cold brew after a long hike or enjoying an espresso shot in a motel room, the results justify the cost. Skip a few stops at pricey coffee shops, and this gadget pays for itself.

I couldn’t eat that, and I didn’t want to throw it in the garbage, so I decided to put it in the freezer until next burger night.  
After defrosting both, I can say that it’s a perfect way to preserve bacon jam and caramelised onions and avoid the effort of making them fresh each time you crave burgers.  
There is no difference between the frozen ones and the fresh ones – same taste, same texture.

Bacon jam ingredients: 1 lb of bacon (diced) , 1 medium white onion (diced) , 3/4 cup of diced fresh strawberries, 3-4 oz of black coffee or espresso – I use a shot,  2 tbsp apple cider vinegar , 1/4 brown sugar, salt and pepper – not too much salt!

To make the bacon jam – cook 1lb of diced bacon, medium high heat until crispy with a slight chew. Remove it from the pan, remove and save the bacon grease. Put the pan back over medium high heat, with the left over bacon drippings still inside, add the diced white onion and sauté for 2-3 minutes. Add in the diced strawberries and continue to sauté for another 2 minutes.

My husband (42) cares for me (34) but he's incredibly avoidant. He's probably on the spectrum but his way of communicating is 'im just being honest' and will say things that are delivered in a really unkind way, especially when what I need most is love, affection and connection with this horrible disease. I very much interalise and over think - more on the anxious attachment style so every month we but heads. When I start to feel better or have a good day, he tells me he's 'at 10%' and will shut down further and it honestly feels like he's trying to make things fair in some way, and I need to support him back (he never gives me a reason for his feelings bad or wants to talk about it, he's just downright rude and grumpy with me). He's not malicious, he's just selfish and hands off. 

It's my second crisis of the year and Ive been thinking about this since Jan but I'm at the point where I'm going to separate and move back to my home town (where my family and friends are) 

The most recent thing he said, when we were trying to connect over a coffee date, was 'after you, the thing I want most in this life is no hassle'  😔 

pmdd is hassle. 

I've started perimenopause so I'm really struggling as it is but the relationship, and living in a town where I have no friends other than my husband is adding a lot to my distress. 

I think I'm making the right decision but I'd love advice. Anyone else here realised they have love for their partner but that they cannot provide enough support especially emotionally. 

Do I ride it out? Knowing that consisteny good days for me might be 10 years away or be better single whilst I'm healing because the man who said yes to in sickness and in health' can't handle or manage the sickness part. Im struggling to let go of being told he doesn't like me, nor is he attracted to me when I'm in pmdd flares. (Lots of crying and depression, and sometimes me begging for closeness /intemacy) 

I'm not sad about the relationship ending, I think I'm feeling relief as I right this but yeah needed to right it down and share somewhere with people that might understand. 

Ps I think he's so hands off that he's pushed me in a way to end the relationship becuase its less hassle for him if I end our marriage. ",2,1755603266.0,PMDDxADHD,1,1.0,False

I have no problem with my morning latte or matcha latte (from a café) but I am miserable after my afternoon coffee (at home, espresso with almond milk (almond, water, salt) )

Is it possible that different types of coffee have different effect on me? Do you have any recommendation what to try or just avoid the afternoon one?

I’ve been thinking a lot about how much digital marketing actually influences the choices we make every single day—even the tiny ones. Like, the other day I was scrolling on Instagram and saw this random ad for a coffee brand I’d never heard of. 

Normally, I’d just scroll past, but they had this super quick 5-second video that made me curious enough to check the website… and guess what? I ended up buying it a week later when I saw the same brand pop up on YouTube. That’s digital marketing doing its thing.

It’s kind of wild when you realize how subtle it is. Half the time, it doesn’t feel like you’re “being marketed to.” It just feels like… content. Recommendations. A friend is sharing a cool product. But behind it, there’s data, targeting, and strategy nudging us along.

What I’ve noticed, especially with [social media marketing for small businesses](https://www.searchenginemagazine.com/social-media-marketing-for-businesses)**,** is how personal it feels compared to the big brands. Like my friend runs a tiny bakery and started posting short Reels of her baking process—no fancy equipment, just her phone. 

Suddenly, people who never even knew the bakery existed started showing up. That’s not some massive ad budget, that’s just smart use of digital marketing making real-world decisions happen (like choosing her cupcakes over a supermarket’s).

I guess my point is: digital marketing isn’t just about “convincing” you. It’s shaping what you see, what you consider, and eventually what you buy—sometimes without you even realizing it. Kind of creepy? Yeah, a little. But also fascinating.

Curious—have you ever caught yourself making a purchase and then realizing later that it was because of some ad you saw three times in the past week? Or is that just me?",2,1755602787.0,u_Thomas96354752,0,1.0,False

How does someone stop ""pretending"" to be their birth sex?

This isn't a ""gotcha"" question, but I keep seeing it, and it's a lot like how ""ladybrain"" went from being a metaphor for ""opposite sex personality and behavior"" to a real belief.

I think ""repression"" is the last thing I don't understand about the kind of trans people I'm not.

What does a day in the life of ""repression"" involve? I assume that ""pretending to be a man"" is really about repressing some set of urges that the person thinks are ""being a woman"", but ""being a woman"" isn't an urge women have.

I don't wake up in the morning and think that I have to ""be"" a woman. I didn't use to wake up and ""today I have to be a man!""

Ever since I had the Internet at home and could get into the work network, which has been close to 35 years, my first thing is ""what has broken at work that I'm going to have to fix?"" or ""has so-and-so answered my email?"" That's followed by get some machine to make me coffee. That's been followed by food, clean clothes, shower (I shower in the mornings). This is still my life. I just rinsed some dishes and put them in the dishwasher (I'm one of those people) and when it's more-full I'll run it. Same before, same after.

I used to decide do I drive a car to work, or a motorcycle? If I had a job where I could bicycle, I'd decide that. I'm going to check the weather soon to decide ""car or motorcycle"". Same before, same after.

Hello, ever since I was a child or younger, I always went once a day or every two days, but after a while I notice that I go once every two days. I've never had blood in my stool. Sometimes it's thin, but not exactly like a pencil, but separated and maybe 2 cm or 1.5 cm in diameter. It happens to me sometimes: I go in the morning normally, and then weirdly I have to go to get some of the rest out. I didnt drink. Alot of water before or fiber neither now after this week I do an i can see better stools and shapes not thin but before it wasnt diarrhea all the time it was solid but sometimes hard and a few ones

I hardly ever have abdominal pain unless I drink milk or something hurts me. I was relaxed and fine these past few months, but until I read about colon c*ncer and its symptoms every day on Google, and out of nowhere, it scared me and traumatized me, so much so that I spend every minute worrying about my stomach or intestines, wondering if they're making noise or not, or whether I have thin stools, etc. I used to go to the bathroom whenever my body wanted to, day or night or whenever. But now, ever since that day I read things on the internet, I have the feeling that I always want to go to the bathroom to defecate. Before I got scared, that didn't happen to me. I didn't have anxiety. I would just say, ""Okay, I go to the bathroom more often, but everything's fine, there's no blood or pain."" And now, all I have is thinking about this, mostly from reading that someone might not have symptoms and be in the terminal or advanced stages without realizing it. All the fear was just from going to the bathroom twice instead of once like before. Something to mention is that lately I was eating more junk food and a lot of coffee and alcohol on the weekends continuously.

This is also someone who told me they were having difficulties, after nine months of trying. Don’t get me wrong, everyone’s journey is unique, and I could understand why you would be disappointed not getting pregnant when you thought you would. However, she got pregnant the next month. Meanwhile, I’ve had fertility operations and about to start IVF. 

I kept my distance from this friend as she tends to have a ‘everything is perfect!’ outlook on life, and my life has really not been perfect. I couldn’t make her baby shower and she simply said ‘it’s a shame you couldn’t come!’ I sent a package of baby outfits and a nice card, as despite my personal situation I am genuinely pleased for her. When she gave birth, I sent a very long message saying I know how overwhelming the first few weeks are with visitors, but whenever she was ready, we’d love to come and see them. Radio silence. She never let us know. Then would send multiple rounds of baby pictures in the group chat, which I eventually stopped responding to. I will admit, I did take a backseat from the friendship, and probably could have reached out to her again to see if we could come and see her, but I just didn’t. She has never once asked about our situation since falling pregnant (she knew everything up until that point.) 

Anyway, my husband is on the phone to his mum, and she says that she got a messenger request from this girl, asking to meet for coffee….? Whilst my husband went to school with her, other than seeing each other at our wedding two years, they hadn’t spoken! They see each other occasionally as she goes into my mother-in-laws workplace but that’s the extent of the relationship. Certainly not close enough to meet up for coffee and cake. She put in the message ‘because I know how much you want to see the baby.’ I just feel so weird about it? Why do I feel weird about it?

Reason One: Applicant deemed to be intentionally homeless because their actions (deliberately giving up previous accommodation to go on vacation) directly led to homelessness when it would have been reasonable and expected to retain their previous accommodation.

Reason Two: Applicant has very high income from YouTube (especially the “Buy Me a Coffee” facility) which could be used to pay for private accommodation at market rates.

Reason Three: Applicant has significantly “above limit” savings, notwithstanding the applicant’s refusal to use those savings to pay for private accommodation at market rates.

Reason Four: Applicant states their requirement is for temporary low cost accommodation to use for only six to twelve months while they increase their savings before returning abroad where they intend to live permanently. Policy is to provide accommodation for those looking for a permanent residence in the United States.

**Housing Complaint - Non Emergency**
This resident all piles up trashbags at the curb all week long.  They are always white trash bags and by the end of each collection rotation there are usually 5-8 bags.  They do this every single week.  The house has city of Lexington carts, but do not always use them.  Instead, they regularly put a new bag of trash on the curb.  Today there were 6 bags.  Occassionally the bags are torn open by animals and messes are made....this is usually not cleaned up.

**plastic barriers are crumbled**
The intersection of Pleasant Ridge Drive and Plaudit Place is an unsightly mess.  In the right turn area, the plastic ""barriers"" are crumbled in numerous spots, the yellow lines are peeling up, weeds are growing in the area, and the yield sign/right turn only is falling backward.  It looks awful and needs attention from the city.  It is the area near Whittaker Bank and 5th/3rd Bank.

I wanted to know if this is a safe method. I usually pair it with coffee since I work online and have a lot to do. I don’t smoke, I don’t drink, I don’t use drugs, or do any other stuff—just nicotine pouches.

So, do you think this is safe? How much per day is considered okay, and how much mg would be too much? I don’t want to overdo it, but I enjoy using it because it helps with my creativity and focus.

1mufed5,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1mufed5/infusing_roasted_coffee_beans_with_aromas_using_a/,Infusing Roasted Coffee Beans with Aromas Using a Custom Box,"Hey everyone 
I’ve been thinking about an idea and would love to get your feedback before I try it.

The concept is to buy already roasted (but not ground) beans and then place them in a sealed infusion box with controlled temperature and humidity.

Here’s the setup I’m planning:
	•	A sealed box with mesh shelves to hold the beans.
	•	On the other side, I would place natural flavor sources like a cigar leaf, vanilla pod, or cotton pads soaked with food-safe oils (e.g., caramel, coconut, etc.).
	•	A small fan inside to circulate the air, so the aroma spreads evenly without direct contact.
	•	The beans would stay inside for a few days, and I’d shake them daily to help distribute the aroma.

The goal isn’t to add syrups or coat the beans, but to let them naturally absorb aromas through exposure—kind of like how roasted beans degas and pick up external scents.

A couple of reasons why I’m considering this:
	1.	I mainly brew pour over coffee, and I don’t want to risk damaging my grinder with sticky syrups or coated beans.
	2.	Buying pre-infused coffee in Dubai is really expensive—around $25–30 per 100g—so I’d rather experiment with making my own.

💡 My questions to you all:
	1.	Would this count as “infused coffee” or would it be seen differently?
	2.	Do you think roasted beans can really absorb enough aroma for it to be noticeable in the cup?
	3.	Any advice on what conditions (time, temperature, humidity) would make this work best?

Curious to hear your thoughts before I start experimenting.

Thanks!

1mufe5x,https://i.redd.it/no7bnr38lyjf1.jpeg,The Roobaroo Story,"# How it begun?

Our entire childhood has been about sharing time with friends either in the open grounds playing cricket or having fun playing during power cuts. But as we grew up, open lands have been converted into establishments, there are no free grounds to play cricket anymore. We noticed the rapid changing urban landscape ( might be for greater good), as our generation had found memories of our childhood, youngsters of this generation can’t find a decent place near their home to unwind, gossip or recollect their fond memories. That’s when the idea of a place to hang out first conceived.

**What’s in a Name?**

As our idea of a place to hang out unrolled, we had a undulating task to choose what kind of place it had to be? what all facilities could we manage in it? what would be the response of the crowd? will there be any takers? out of all these we had one major concern……..NAME?

As the work progressed and since it was a *covid year*, all the work was being done at snail’s pace. We had limited time to catch up as lock down extended for 9 months, after infinite zoom meetings, web searches and telephonic conversations, we wondered what it could it be when two people sit across (not essentially for a cup of coffee) and have a pleasant conversations? and since me and my partners are from Hyderabad, we are more familiar with the language here. That’s when “ROOBAROO” striked, we had slightest hesitation, are we making it sound too orthodox? too old fashioned for a continental cafe? our architect wanted it more updated one but when we discussed with our brand designer, she said its cool but was worried about the design. Modern yet contemporary, brand should reflect coffee! must admit she has done a brilliant job with the logo, which describes coffee being enjoyed by 2 people.

**The ever after continued…**

And since then, after the launch in January 14th of 2021, we saw people happy, with the food, the ambience, the service. Its with pride we can say, this is the continental cafe in the east of Hyderabad, then after a lot of our roobaroo crowd drew inspiration and established their brands, happy for them though. What we are content about is, we create memories of endless youngsters who spend time here, working on projects, planning their careers, team meetings, timeless conversations, tomorrow these young Indians as they embark on their journey, *Roobaroo wants to be a part of their memories* in the most optimistic way possible. As our understanding of the business grew, we had to take some drastic measures even if they affected our sales and loosing our customers to some extent….

The girl was being bullied in an alleyway, the boy walks in on the bullying with a cup of coffee, splashing it on one of them and fighting, then the dude gets hit in the head with a damn pipe, the girl screams and makes the bullies run away.

1mufc2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1mufc2e/missed_period_for_months/,missed period for months,"
Hello everyone!

Back in 2021–2022, I started experiencing really bad symptoms that I later researched  was adrenal PCOS (based on my reports and diagnosis). I was prescribed inositol supplements since I declined birth control.

At that time, I had horrible acne, anxiety, sleep issues, and really bad PMS before my periods. With the supplements and lifestyle changes, over time, my acne started clearing up, and I felt less anxious after moving out of my country.

Everything felt somewhat manageable until this year when I suddenly stopped getting my period for the past 5 months. Before this, the longest delay I ever had was about two weeks during stressful times.

Also, I got the HPV vaccine in march (after my last period). From January to May, I was under a lot of stress, but from May to August I’ve actually been stress-free and healthy. During this time, I’ve felt so much better overall, and my skin has stayed mostly clear.

I did not drink caffeine at all before as it gave me panic attacks and palpitations but I am able to happily enjoy a cup of matcha or sometimes even coffee without anything bad! 

For context, I’ve always been naturally very skinny and even underweight most of my life. After moving to the U.S. in 2023, I gained weight gradually (which I was actually happy about), but by 2025 I’ve gained around 30 pounds, much more than I expected.

What confuses me is that, despite my health anxiety, my H1ACB test in 2024 showed extremely low blood sugar, so I don’t think I had insulin resistance. Now, with the weight gain and my missed period, I’m scared I might be developing it especially given the processed American diet.

That being said, besides the weight gain and cycle issues, my overall health has actually improved. I sleep better, I don’t get sick as often, and I’ve been eating more consistently without constantly falling ill like before. My indigestion issues or frequent flu etc. got way better.

I just don’t know what’s causing my cycle changes whether it’s related to the HPV + flu shot I got in March, the stress from earlier this year, or the combination of diet and weight gain (I’ve also noticed some “skinny fat” in my belly and arms).

I do plan on getting a full health checkup soon, but I wanted to ask if anyone here has had similar experiences or has advice to share.

Since that night he started getting full on mucusy green poops. Previously his poops weren’t that mucusy and were yellowish/mustard in colour. We waited one week thinking that the change in poops could be due to the vaccine. After one week when it didn’t get better I started searching online and found out about CMPA. I am so new to this so I was quite confused. I saw a red streak in his poo (although not sure if it is one) and got scared thinking it is blood and decided to see the doctor asap. Doctor gave us a stool test which came positive for bacteria.

The doctor prescribed antibiotics and zinc for 7 days. During the first 4 days the poo didn’t get any better so I did some more reading and decided to go dairy free. Today we have finished our antibiotic course and his poop has just slightly started getting better (less greener at least). 

What could it be? Just a bacterial infection or cmpa or both? Or could it be rotavirus messing up his gut? Or can dairy intolerance mess up the gut and show up as bacteria in the poop/reports 🤣He does not have any other symptom and I know CMPA is hard to diagnose! 

Please advice, should I go back to taking dairy (miss milk in my coffee) or wait? Do we do another stool test to check the presence of bacteria? Would probiotics help his gut? 

I am so new to this so hence the questions. Please share any experience or advice :) Will share some photos of his poops in the comments.",1,1755601565.0,MSPI,4,1.0,False

I tested it so you don’t have to gamble your grade (or sanity).

https://preview.redd.it/6k7jwbewjyjf1.png?width=1291&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1848ff1ba68949f32110098c06f600b380afc77

Below is a practical, student-friendly review, pros/cons, and a quick scorecard. I’ll keep it conversational, skip the robotic buzzwords, and flag where this shines - and where it doesn’t. Note: always follow your school’s academic integrity rules. Use services for drafting, editing, and study support.

# Why I tried LeoEssays

* I needed help outlining and polishing a 7-page analysis (tight turnaround).
* I wanted a transparent essay writing service online with clear pricing and visible revisions.
* I was comparing options to see which one might be the best essay writing service for speed + quality without sounding like it was written by a toaster.

You can peek at the site yourself: [**https://leoessays.com/**](https://leoessays.com/?utm_source=R254&utm_medium=google)

# Ordering experience (fast, minimal friction)

* **Briefing form:** straightforward; you can attach rubric, readings, or your own draft.
* **Deadline options:** flexible; rush costs more (shocking, I know).
* **Communication:** live chat + updates; I asked for 2 structure changes and got them within hours.
* **Delivery:** draft first, then a final after my comments.

If you want to test the flow, here’s the brand link: [**LeoEssays**](https://leoessays.com/?utm_source=R254&utm_medium=google)

# Quality & authenticity (what actually landed in my inbox)

* **Structure:** logical, clean transitions, no waffle.
* **Sources:** credible (journal articles + textbook), properly cited.
* **Voice:** human (not “AI-ish”); matched my brief after I shared a sample paragraph.
* **Revisions:** handled quickly; tone tightened to sound like *me*.

Would I call it the best essay writing service across the whole internet? Bold claim. But for the price-to-quality ratio and how well they followed my outline, it’s solid.

# Pricing & value (what you pay vs. what you get)

* Not the cheapest, not the priciest. You’re paying for speed, edits, and responsive support.
* My take: worth it if you need editing, structuring, citations, and clarity, especially under time pressure.

# Pros & cons (no sugarcoat)

**Pros**

* Clean structure and credible sources
* Quick, polite revisions
* Human tone that doesn’t scream “template”
* Clear brief, clear deliverables

**Cons**

* Rush pricing can add up
* You still need to guide the voice (share a sample or outline)

# Quick scorecard

|Category|My Score (out of 10)|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Writing quality|9.7|Strong structure, good synthesis|
|Speed|9.0|Fast revisions on same day|
|Communication|9.5|Chat + friendly updates|
|Referencing|8.6|Accurate, consistent style|
|Value|8.7|Fair for turnaround & support|

# Who it’s best for

If you’re thinking, “I need an essay writing service for me that can digest a messy brief and hand back a clean draft,” this fits. It’s also a decent writing essay service for students who already did the reading but need help translating ideas into a coherent paper.

If you’re shopping around and comparing, LeoEssays is a practical baseline - use it to benchmark what responsive support and clean structure should look like from an essay writing service.

# How I used it (ethically)

I treated the draft like a study aid:

* Asked for an outline + annotated references
* Compared their structure with my rubric
* Rewrote in my own voice and added my class notes

That’s how I’d approach any essay writing service - as a drafting and editing partner, not a “submit and forget.” If you need a straightforward essay writing service online, LeoEssays is easy to navigate and doesn’t drown you in upsells.

For plain text lovers: you can check it out here → [**leoessays.com**](https://leoessays.com/?utm_source=R254&utm_medium=google)

# Final verdict

Reliable, quick on revisions, and good at turning messy instructions into a readable draft. It won’t do your thinking for you (nor should it), but if you want structured help under a deadline, it’s a strong contender for the best essay writing service in the “balanced cost + quality” lane.

# Your turn

* What matters more to you - speed or specialized subject expertise?
* Have you tried similar services? What did you wish they did better?

We hit it off right away. We opened up quickly about life, struggles, goals, and I eventually met many of his friends and family. It genuinely felt like we were building a solid, meaningful friendship.

Over time, though, I noticed how rigid and argumentative he could be. Conversations often felt like debates (even when they didn’t need to be) and he always had to be right. Still, I supported him a lot. I gave him relationship advice, career tips, and tried to be there when he needed someone. I honestly thought the support went both ways.

We got into a conversation about politics. He told me he was a DJT supporter and asked about my views, and I said I leaned Democrat. His response was, “That’s probably just because of your dad.” I explained that while my upbringing influenced me, my beliefs are still my own. He laughed and said, “How much?” I told him I didn’t want to quantify it, but he insisted, saying, “I’m going to assume a lot then” and then started trying to convince me that I actually agree with him more than I realize. It didn’t feel like a respectful conversation (it felt like he was trying to invalidate my stance and manipulate the direction of the discussion).

The next day, I texted him and said I didn’t appreciate the way he dismissed my views and made assumptions about me. I said an apology would suffice, not in a confrontational way, just to express that I felt disrespected.

He said he doesn’t like texting and preferred to talk in person. When we met up, I bought him a coffee at Starbucks and we sat down on a sofa and the whole thing exploded. He said I was trying to bring him down to my level, accused me of having low self-esteem, called me controlling and untrustworthy, sounded like the devil and said I “love conflict"" and even said I was bullying him at a given moment. It felt like he was unloading a bunch of resentment and going straight for personal attacks. I was stunned. I reminded him how much I’d supported him in the past (not to guilt him, just to show that I’ve always acted in good faith). He accused me of being manipulative and trying to make him feel bad for me.

He ended the conversation by saying, “This friendship is over,” and insisted on doing a prayer with me and I declined respectfully saying it wasn't about that. He got up and told me to hug him which I also declined but extended my hand to shake and he shook it then walked away.

Afterward, I sent him one last message and blocked him:

“I don’t feel bad about myself, Lucas, nor do I have low self-esteem. I’m okay the way I am—even better than some people, to be honest.What really bothered me was how you turned a simple request into a character assassination.People make mistakes, including you—you even joke about them sometimes. But today you took things to a different level, throwing insults at me non-stop.I don’t deserve that kind of treatment. I’m not interested in being friends after this. Ciao for now.”

It's been 7 months of no contact but absolutely no one has sided with me out of the entire church I use to go to (I stopped going for 7 months now). For some reason his close friend keeps reaching out every 2-3 months and it seems performative or like he's trying to collect info and report back to Lucas. AITA ?",5,1755601306.0,AITAH,13,0.86,False

1muf629,https://i.redd.it/jgyrl1vljyjf1.jpeg,Bujairami No Limit (Pacific Chill clone),"**Warning**: Skip to the TLDR at the bottom if you don't like my rambling.  

Let's start with the fact that I've never tried the OG, and I'm not even going to, because if I am to buy a $350 fragrance, it needs to fix my car and make me coffee every morning. But I have tried Pinnace White and Jean Lowe Vibe.  

 I like the profile quite a bit. It's uplifting, super casual, very fresh, and completely unisex. It pretty much shouts ""I'm up for anything"". Will it work for a summer party? Yes. A restaurant? Yes. Chilling at home? Yep. A daily at your work? Yes.  A job interview? Ummm... Maybe. But almost anything you're gonna do in summer, it's appropriate. It's inviting, sweet, fresh, slightly playful, a little a aquatic, slightly minty... Just all around great. Very fruity, more on the photorealistic side and less on the candy fruit side. 

I much prefer the Pacific Chill to the 3 Afternoon Swim clones I've tried (Pinnace Oryn, North Stag IV, and Jean Lowe Azure), which were pretty much just an orange bomb (especially North Stag... From those 3, Oryn was the best one). No Limit smells higher quality the Vibe and performs better than Pinnace White and Vibe. But if you have any if the other 2, don't buy this, it's not THAT different. I can't believe I got it for under $14 (it's usually about $40). Would I rebuy it for $40? Probably not, as I'll most likely find a deep sale on something else I like. But it did made it into my top 10 summer frags, which I have to admit is an easier task then getting into my top 10 winter frags. I wish I bought 2 of these instead of getting Bujairami Breezy (that one was also on a deep sale, but I'm not a fan... It's smells like Aqua Dubai, or pretty much pure soap).  

#TLDR:   
**Subjective Scent Score**: 8.4  
 **Longevity**: 7-8 hours on skin.   
 **Projection**: about 1.5 hours of medium to strong projection, then a small to medium scent bubble for another hour or two.  
 **Blind buy safety score**: 9.0. this has 0 notes that will offend anyone. Could be a 10.0 if it wasn't unisex (some guys don't like unisex).   
 **Unisex Score**: Unisex and maybe slightly fem leaning.   
 **Value Score**: 10.0 for me ($14 for 100ml of an above average performing and high quality scent). 6.2 if you buy it from Bujairami directly.   
 **Bottle design**: 9.9 (I'm a sucker for Bujairami bottle design... Aether is the only bottle I like more)   
 **Atomizer Score**: 9.0 (pressurized with narrow distribution fan, so you don't waste half of the fragrance because you miss your wrist when you spray from further away than 3"")  
 **Conclusion**: Another good Bujairami... Nice to have them back on my whitelist after the disappointment I had with Breezy.

-wife is a light sleeper, gets interrupted easily and has a hard time falling back asleep.
-my “mornings” start at 0515 where I wake up, drink coffee, dink around on my phone, maybe a brief walk, eat breakfast, make lunch and snacks, then shower at 0700 and out the door by 0715-0730.
-wife gets to “sleep” or at least the opportunity to sleep until 0700 whenever I come in to take a shower and get ready for the day (can we all just agree that en suite bathrooms are stupid already?)
-we both go to bed at 930-10p
-we have 2 kids, 1 3yo and 1 14mo old 
-I’m on 3 yo duty at any time, she’s on 14mo old duty (that’s our agreement).
-baby wakes up at 445, agreement says she’s up. 
-**she expects me to get up with him because it’s “close” to when I usually wake up**
-I say no, it’s the baby you’re up and if I get up with him my day starts at 445, you at least have the opportunity to sleep until 0700 (I’m not the most quiet person and this is an old a** house from the 50s with foundation issues, so I’m saying 0700, technically she can stay until 0730 whenever the gremlins wake up for the day)
-she gives it the old college try and goes in there and sticks with him for 5 minutes even though whenever she sets him down he’s still at a 7/8 (crying, screaming, you know the scale)
-she comes back in and I’m like “WTF did you help him or what?” she says “he wanted to nurse and I said no (she stopped nursing 2 weeks ago) and he got mad, there was no winning. He’ll calm down I’m sure.”
-he starts crying again so then I go back in to help him, whatever, my day is starting early anyways. So I grab my shorts and walking gear and put it in the hallway to walk at sunrise.
-he’s not calming down for me so she comes in and calls me worthless, and thanks for nothing. 
-she then sends me a long text saying that if he goes off again that I’m up and that I’m selfish for not taking care of our kids and just chilling drinking coffee and choosing myself over my kids. 

I kind of get where she’s coming from but I do want the opportunity to take a walk to stretch my body. I’m also an introvert with a very strategic mind that consumes my brain at my job most of the day.

I'm not a burn victim, however, consider if a child were, emotionally & physically scarred by narcissist parents, as many are, & don't have the words, or understand what's happened to them, & can't communicate about it. Isolated, without siblings for 18 years. Parents are skinny from coffee, beer & cigarette diets, while the kid gets fat from junk food. Beat up at school for being fat, poor, smelling like cigarettes. Parents mocking everything you like. Expecting you to grovel. Humiliating you in public. All you can think is, when I'm old enough I can get dafuq away from them. Sure, running away into the abyss is an option, where everyone would call you a spoiled liar, truant, in need of harsher circumstances, get institutionalized worse than public school.

It gets so bad, they pull me out of school in 1991, before home schooling was a thing; one of the best & worst things to happen. Parents divorce. Lose the weight, get a fast food job, things are looking up. And they were.

I go to live with my mother & her husband who likes to tell the same hours long fking stories over & over every night & expects you to listen.  But he doesn't hurt my mother, so whatever. He does like to disrespect me, my father, but he's a drunk idiot. I go through a dozen dead end jobs. Several girlfriends. Decide at 25 to go to community college, where I'm able to live halfway out of my mother's house on grants, & a couple jobs. No direction. I don't drink, do drugs. The social scene is built around alcohol, drugs, wanna be gangsters, bad music, NFaiL. Everyone's full of shit, on drugs, working overtime to pay bills for sh!t they don't need or use, acting like being mentally ill is the new enlightenment. Losers. I'm no athlete. Did I mention the joy of losing 100lbs so no matter how smart, well hung, good in bed, loving, the second they see you naked it's over. They can do better.

The adult world is totally fucked. No one did sh!t about 9/11. Most ppl won't acknowledge chemtrails. It's like everyone's stuck on stupid, & my oppertunities are to work for them & in my little time off I can hope to die from autoerotic asphixiation. What a time to be alive. Oh, I could sell dope, steal, save up, buy a condo to live in all alone & watch the soft porn of tv & movies until I'm a 150,000 years old. Luckily, I found Gød. Or, met half way. Real, spiritual enlightenment. No one pushed it on me. It was a realization about how gød is everywhere & nowhere @ once & that's considered negative/yang space. Not good or bad, like a film negative.

I got tired of playing video games & started spending time online chatting on mIRC, occult & kayfabe forums. I hunted down every dirty secret about everything, in a time when google actually functioned, books were still a thing, & people went online & published everything they could think of, before social network ghettos communized everything. I can report that there's a 60+ year lapse between tech ready to go in the lab & finding it @ best buy. There's a science(s) to spirituality. Yes, the jay ee double yous have the bulk on it, hence their wild wealth & industry (it's really a saturn cult. Muslims are a moon cult, xians a hades/sun cult). Quantum Physics was first known as Kabbalah, the Tree of Life in the Bible. If you learn music you'll learn how every system works. Sacred Geometry holds the patterns of life & death. Goëtia is real. Kundalini is real. Astral Projection, Lucid dreaming is real-it's just like anything else, you have to sort through mountains of bs to find the truth. Bagua. I ching. Chakras are as real as our physical arms & legs. They pertain to the magnetic fields in and around us that we are mostly blind to due to our pineal glands being hijacked by toxins in food, water, & radio frequencies. You can use ""magic"" sigils, your voice to open portals, contact beings from the stars (Grant Morrison). All demonstratably true. But so what? Who cares?

I have no advice for anyone. Do whatever works for you. Life isn't fair. Great people die alone penniless while ignorant nepo baby crooks get richer by screwing up.",1,1755600812.0,depression,0,1.0,False

Honestly, I’m at a point where I just want to date seriously… long term and hopefully leading to marriage. 

About me:
- 30 years old
- Biological female 
- Straight 
- Christian
- Single. Never been engaged nor married. 
- No kids.
- Curvy in all the right places, plus size.
- Pleasing to the eyes (your mileage may vary, but so far the reviews are good 😏)

By day, I’m a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning 🩺). By night and during my days off, I’m probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy café, pretending to “study” but actually people-watching… or getting lost in a book I picked up from FullyBooked.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it’s a sacred ritual, and walking around the city with my earphones in, imagining I’m in the opening scene of a movie. I’m also a sucker for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, and city lights that feel like they’re winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely. 💯 

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my playful and adventurous side.

What I’m looking for…
A guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you: 
- Are well-groomed, carry yourself confidently 
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a CENOMAR cert when we meet 😂)
- No human kids 
- Christian (genuinely God-fearing)
- Love and/or have dogs
- Enjoy spontaneous long drives
- Can appreciate the charm of bookstores and late-night cafés
- Preferably you’re in Cebu City / Mandaue City (easier for coffee dates and spontaneous drives), but I’m open to LDR if everything clicks.

If this sounds like you…
Send me a DM and tell me: 
- About yourself comprehensively, like the important aspects in your background, current work, and/or long-term goals AND 
- Your go-to coffee order OR
- Your dream road trip destination OR
- The last book you couldn’t put down

He also only closed the shop after getting new E-soul. This is because he finally got rid of the OG E-soul who successfully took down Zero, the one he's trying to revive. Therefore, if another Zero came along no E-soul is going to stop him because the new E-soul is under his control.

So yeah that's it. The shop was just the perfect cover up for him to approach young vulnerable people to control.

(Note: the reason why he didn't accept Yang Chen as an E-soul actor is probably to make him more vulnerable and easier to manipulate. At least that's my opinion.)",5,1755599579.0,ToBeHero_X,0,0.86,False

Would it be better to just send a quick “had a nice time, take care” and move on? Or should I try asking her out again to see if maybe she was just nervous on the first date?

1muemwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1muemwc/my_eczema_and_tsw/,My eczema and TSW,"Hi all just a post of my (29M, UK) experience to what I went through. A bit of background I had eczema as a kid but nothing unusual to what a kid would have i.e inside arms and back of knees then from about age 10 I had absolutely nothing no problems even through university where I wasn’t exactly doing eczema friendly diets or limited alcohol consumption. 
End of 2019 / start of 2020 I had a random patch of eczema on my inner left thigh no idea where it came from but I got some steroid cream for it put that on for a day or 2 then it was gone and absolutely no problems again. October 2022 it all started up just small but itchy patches that gradually got worse and worse culminating in me going to A&E over Christmas with what looked like sunburn on my back, shoulders and arms. I don’t know what was the exact trigger but early 2022 we became homeowners to a house that needed lots of cosmetic work so sanding plastering and painting, my nan passed away and I started a new job so a few stressful things rolled into 5 months. I also started boxing which made me more sweaty than I have ever been which aggravated things. In the run up to A&E I was on steroid creams like betnovate and eumovate which temporarily helped but eventually it was spreading all over and I was given prednisone tablets along with steroid creams. When I left A&E they gave me prednisone again which is I think where the steroid addiction began. From then I was on creams on and off until January this year when not even the creams were helping so I took drastic action and decided to completely cut them out and do NMT. I have a friend who went through TSW a few years ago who was a massive help throughout 

Red light therapy 
In the run up to my NMT decision I started red light therapy at a tanning place by me, it wasn’t the miracle cure I hoped for but initially I did love the feeling when I came off the bed and I do think it helped me stave off the worst withdrawal symptoms. I’ve been on recently and it made the red bits come up more red so I’ve knocked that on the head for myself but I’m sure it has results for others

NMT
This was tough and pretty miserable, my doctor was next to useless and didn’t want me to even try this even when I told them that I’d tried everything they had suggested over the last few years and it hadn’t worked so what was the harm in trying something else. They referred me to a dermatologist and a therapist service as I was at rock bottom. During NMT I had 1 pint of water through the day and we ate mostly chicken, thin cut steaks and salmon. In a morning I’d have kefir with blueberries and honey and seeded toast. Lunchtimes would usually be egg based in some way and chicken bone broth. We cut out all flavours other than salt and pepper and I stopped drinking normal milk. I’d also try and get an hours workout (never to a point that made me sweat) sometimes this would be easier than other days but the feeling during / after a workout was some of the only optimistic feeling I would get. I’m lucky enough to have some equipment in the garage like an exercise bike and smaller weights 

Clothing 
Cotton only, primark was my best friend I basically lived in their long sleeve tops (I could only get womens but no one could tell) I used white long sleeve tops to sleep in and changed them every day, some are permanently marked red in places from my worst nights. Joggers and jogger shorts for my bottom half. You put on a lot of washes and I used ecover detergent and only wore clothes once 

Sleep
This pretty much didn’t happen apparently it’s part of fight or flight you just never feel tired at night even when you haven’t slept. Nighttime is when I would get my most itchy, I was signed off from work so I basically just resigned myself to not sleeping at night but I still tried to make sure I didn’t lie in or get into a habit of day sleeping. Eventually after begging the doctors gave me zopiclone sleeping tablets the stronger ones definitely helped so long as I took them about 8pm and slept through the worst of the itching although I have only in the last few days been able to sleep through a night solid 

Showering 
I basically cut out showering and still don’t really shower much now. Eventually your underarms get used to it and the smell stops but if you aren’t going out it’s nothing you can’t cope with, I’d recommend roll on deodorant if your arm pits aren’t really affected like mine weren’t or spraying clothes rather than skin. I used a bowl of warm water to wash pits and bits when I did feel grubby. I did occasionally have Dead Sea salt baths unsure how they helped if at all but I’m talking 2 or 3 at most through the whole thing

Pain
I took paracetamol and ibuprofen throughout, no idea if it actually helped but sometimes it stopped pain. At times I took codeine paracetamol too

Itching 
No matter what this is going to happen, I was lucky in that during the day I didn’t really get itchy, my worst was at night as I said before when I would go to town on myself you just can’t help it, I tried to itch the clothing but I also got a cosi care bumpy ball which was great but then I would eventually just have to start scratching with my nails. Speaking of which they started to grow bending down and still grow a bit funny now. One thing that really helps is ice gel packs. I had about 3 on rotation in the freezer and a large one specifically for the neck. I’d wrap these in a pillow case and use through the night or during the day if particularly itchy 

Creams and moisturiser 
This is the biggie. Through my whole experience you name a cream I’ve tried it. During the NMT I used nothing for the first 3 months, in April I saw posts about calm balm so I tried that and it seemed ok, later I tried balmond a which was quite nice but it would normally be a case of once a day for a few days then I’d get lazy and have a break from it. Ultimately putting nothing on gave the best results for me. I’ve recently started using thunderbird rescue cream once a day but my skin is in a much better place now I wouldn’t have used it in my worst times I don’t think. 

Water and drinking 
During NMT I had the one pint but then about 2 months into that I started to drink a lot of water. I’ve always been bad for staying hydrated but now I make the effort to have at least 7 pints during the day. Teas and coffees I was fine with as lime I say I had no itching during the day. Alcohol I basically cut out although the odd binge for social events I attended later on helped with sleep. I make ginger shots at home which is a mix of a few things and some other bits which I take almost daily and a probiotic from Hanna Sillitoe

Skin
You shed a lot of skin during the night so sleep with the hoover next to you. I barely shed anything now but I’m so in the habit I still hoover the bed. I also got a little mini hand held hoover which I could take if we went away overnight anywhere more for my peace of mind and also to hoover the floor if I couldn’t be bothered to plug in the big hoover 

Sunlight
I’ve recently started to sit out in the sun to get it on my skin I can’t tell if it helps or not but I have rapidly improved over the last month

Time
At the end of the day as much as I hate to admit there’s no miracle cure that I came across, I think you just have to ride out the storm and know it will get better. Take steps to try and make yourself comfortable where you can, the sleeping tablets were a blessing for me when I got to that point to eventually be able to get some sort of sleep but just be careful not to overdo them. Dermatologist was no help they would put me back on steroids straight away to the point where she ripped up a prescription in the appointment and said “that was a waste of time”. I am on a waiting list for phototherapy so we will see how that goes. I still get itchy but most places don’t come up red or tear the skin if I do scratch and my skin just generally feels a lot healthier. Still work to do but I’m honestly a million times better than I was 

I’ve been incredibly lucky in that I haven’t seemed to have taken as long as a lot of people to start healing and although I was covered all over I never had it on my face. I’ve also had an amazing support network of family and friends and my work were so understanding. The Sunday just gone is the first time since January I’ve had my arms out so that was a huge milestone 
I appreciate it’s a long post and I’ve tried to cram as much as I can in through what’s been some of the worst months of my life. From April I’ve also had 3 stag dos and 4 weddings including my own next week which at one point I thought I’d never make it to. I’ll answer any questions where I can and I wish any of you going through this all the best, ride the storm. I think ultimately try anything and if it doesn’t make you worse but makes you feel happy do that",0,1755599386.0,eczema,0,0.5,False

1muemkr,https://i.redd.it/of4zae88eyjf1.jpeg,Feedback on my pastry + coffee caravan brand idea: Noir (with a raven logo),"I’m starting a small pastry + coffee caravan inside a park. The idea is for it to be cute, minimal, and Instagrammable — a hangout spot for teenagers and people in their 20s.

I’d love your honest feedback on the name and logo concept:
	1.	The Name – Noir
	•	Do you think Noir works as a name for a pastry/coffee brand?
	•	Is the mystery/ambiguity a good thing (makes people curious), or should I be more direct about what we sell?
	•	Does the name sound attractive to a younger crowd?
	2.	The Logo Concept
	•	I’m imagining the word “Noir” with a raven perched on top.
	•	Does the raven fit the vibe, or is it too dark for a pastry/coffee brand?
	•	Would you see this logo and guess it’s food/coffee, or something else entirely?
	3.	Branding Feel
	•	Noir is meant to feel modern, minimal, and a little mysterious.
	•	Do you think that works with a cozy little caravan booth in a park, or should I aim for something warmer/lighter?
	•	Should I keep the mystery, or add a tagline (like: “Noir – Coffee & Pastries”) for clarity?
	4.	General Advice
	•	Any tips for making the brand stand out against other coffee/pastry spots?
	•	What colors would work best with the Noir + raven theme but still feel inviting?

I’d really appreciate your thoughts 🙏 I want to build a brand that feels unique but also welcoming.",0,1755599353.0,design_critiques,2,0.25,False

1muelrn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BoysenberryDue7563/comments/1muelrn/why_egyptians_love_nespresso_the_rise_of_capsule/,☕ Why Egyptians Love Nespresso: The Rise of Capsule Coffee Culture 🇪🇬✨,"Coffee has always been a central part of Egyptian culture. From the traditional *ahwa* (coffeehouses) where friends gather over strong Turkish coffee, to the booming modern café scene offering lattes and cappuccinos, Egypt’s relationship with coffee is both historic and evolving. But in recent years, a new trend has entered Egyptian homes: [Nespresso capsules and machines](https://fengany.com/collections/nespresso-pods). What was once considered a luxury item is now a lifestyle essential. Egyptians are embracing capsule coffee culture for its **convenience, variety, and premium quality at home**. Let’s explore why Nespresso has become such a beloved choice.

# 🌍 A Shift in Egyptian Coffee Culture

Egyptians have long associated coffee with **social connection**. Whether at family gatherings or bustling ahwas, coffee has always been more than just a drink—it’s an experience. But as modern life becomes busier, lifestyles are shifting. Long commutes, demanding jobs, and busy family routines mean less time for traditional brewing methods.

At the same time, international exposure through travel, social media, and global café trends has introduced Egyptians to espresso, cappuccinos, and other specialty drinks. The result? A growing desire to enjoy café-style beverages at home—quickly and easily. Nespresso steps in here, offering the perfect solution: a capsule system that delivers premium quality with zero hassle.

# ⚡ Convenience Meets Quality

One of the strongest reasons Egyptians have embraced Nespresso is the **perfect balance between speed and taste**. With just one capsule and the press of a button, anyone can brew a café-quality cup in under a minute.

The capsules are **nitrogen-sealed**, which locks in the aroma and freshness of the coffee. This means every cup tastes as bold and rich as if it were freshly ground. Machines heat up quickly, require minimal cleaning, and are compact enough to fit in Egyptian kitchens or offices. For Egyptians balancing fast-paced lifestyles, Nespresso is a game-changer.

# 🎨 Variety for Every Mood

Egyptians love variety in their food and drink, and Nespresso perfectly caters to this preference. The brand offers a wide range of capsules to suit different moods and moments of the day.

* **Espresso capsules** ⚡ for strong, intense flavors in the morning.
* **Lungo capsules** ☀️ for smoother, larger cups perfect for relaxing.
* **Flavored capsules** 🍫 like vanilla, caramel, and chocolate for dessert-like indulgence.
* **Decaffeinato options** 🌙 for late-night coffee without the caffeine.
* **Limited editions** 🌍 that bring global flavors straight to Egyptian kitchens.

This diversity allows Egyptians to create their own café menu at home—switching between bold espressos during workdays and sweet flavored coffees on weekends.

# 💸 Affordable Luxury

At first, capsule coffee may seem expensive compared to traditional brewing. However, when compared to daily visits to coffee shops, Nespresso offers **affordable luxury**.

Each capsule costs a fraction of a café espresso, and bundle deals online make it even more cost-effective. Machines are also available in various models, making them accessible across different budgets. For Egyptians who value both quality and practicality, Nespresso feels like an investment in everyday comfort.

# 🏪 The Role of Online Shopping in Egypt

The rise of **e-commerce in Egypt** has played a huge role in popularizing capsule coffee. Trusted platforms like [**Fengany**](https://fengany.com/) make it easy for customers to buy authentic Nespresso capsules and machines without leaving home.

Online stores not only ensure authenticity but also offer bundle deals, seasonal promotions, and fast delivery across Egypt. Accessories such as capsule holders, descaling kits, and milk frothers are also widely available, giving customers the full Nespresso experience. For tech-savvy Egyptians, online shopping is making capsule coffee more accessible than ever.

# 🥂 Influenced by Café Culture

The café boom in Egypt has influenced consumer tastes. Young Egyptians especially enjoy visiting trendy spots for cappuccinos, lattes, and iced coffees. However, daily visits can become expensive and time-consuming.

With Nespresso machines, Egyptians can replicate this **café-quality experience at home**. By adding a milk frother, they can easily prepare cappuccinos, creamy lattes, or even iced coffee. It’s like bringing the café into the kitchen—perfect for family mornings, hosting guests, or winding down after work.

# 🌱 Sustainability & Conscious Choices

As global awareness of sustainability grows, Egyptians are becoming more conscious consumers too. Nespresso appeals to this mindset through **sustainable sourcing** of coffee beans and recycling initiatives for used capsules. This eco-conscious approach resonates with younger generations in particular, who value brands that care about the planet. ♻️🌍

# 🚀 The Future of Capsule Coffee in Egypt

Looking ahead, Nespresso’s growth in Egypt shows no signs of slowing. We can expect to see:

* Expanded capsule ranges, including more limited editions.
* Wider availability both in retail outlets and online platforms.
* A blending of capsule coffee with Egypt’s traditional coffee rituals, creating a unique cultural mix.

As more Egyptians experience the convenience and variety of capsule coffee, its popularity will only continue to rise.

# ✨ Final Sip

Nespresso has transformed the way Egyptians enjoy coffee at home. It reflects **changing lifestyles**, where speed and convenience are essential, while still honoring the love for rich, flavorful coffee. From bold espressos ⚡ to indulgent caramel or vanilla blends 🍫, there’s something for every mood and moment.

In short, Egyptians love Nespresso because it delivers **quality, convenience, and variety**—a combination perfectly suited to modern living. Whether it’s a quick morning boost, a relaxing afternoon lungo, or a cozy dessert coffee, Nespresso has become part of Egypt’s evolving coffee story. ☕❤️",1,1755599278.0,u_BoysenberryDue7563,0,1.0,False

1muek2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1muek2z/i_am_obsessed_with_my_brothers_friend/,I am obsessed with my brothers friend,"I (22F)single have a massive crush on my brothers friend (21M). Where do I start. I met said crush maybe three years ago. He was first introduced to me at my family’s lake house by a family friend (21F) who was on and off with said crush for 4 years as he lived close by to her school and developed a friendship which led to a sexual arrangement which led to a complete end of contact. They only talk when they see each other which is very unlikely unless both are visiting our lake house at the same time. While I have not heard his side of the story of why there said relationship concluded  my family friend has informed me that he has confessed his love for her a few months before she started dating her now ex boyfriend (despite her breaking the situation ship ish a month prior) and he has attempted to contact her a few months ago through various ways such as texting her “I was watching this movie and just though about you, hope things are well”. While I have observed through conversation that she is “completely turned off from him ” and “she is unable to see him the same”. I believe she is completely over him considering she recently broke up with her boyfriend that she is “still in love with”. Despite removing herself from his life completely and not remaining in contact or friends my said crush became good friends with my brother and his friends which are now a solid group. My brother would consider him one of his best friends,  we have shared a lot of memories and experiences together including days at our lake house, watching their footy games (they formed a friendship team with all of his closest friends) and recently met up in europe with his friends from highschoool. While our friendship is not as established as my brothers hence we have had deep conversations collectively as a group and shared some great moments and  some deep eye contact and smiles  (when I hang out collectively with my brothers whole friendship group). While I haven’t heard this directly from said crush my sister (21F) boyfriend (21M) does share mutual friends in which he revealed that allegedly said crush said to him over a coffee exchange “I had a thing for her (me) but I can’t go there because of her brother”.  I still am good friends with the family friend mentioned who I happen to believe my said crush may still be in love with. Said crush was also asked by my brothers friend (23M) in the recent months if he still likes his old fling hence my family friend to which he responded with “yeahhhhh actually fuck no not anymore”.  But I am still convinced he may be in love with her or may have residual feelings for her. On top of that my family friend did say he is a said “bitch” hence not likely to make a move or express any interest. From certain behaviour he has displayed hence volunteering for us to be in the same team if we are ever playing a friendly game of sport, catching him constantly glancing at me in big group gatherings, my sisters friends also have observed him staring at me at her birthday, enough for them to tell my sister who in turn told me. Will always grab me for a dance at a party and of course the verbal confession to my sisters boyfriend. The reason I am writing to reddit is because I go through phases when he is around (sometimes I will see him for days on end or not see him for months) where I have dreams about him every night even when dating in the past, I would have dreams about my brothers friend and not the person I was currently dating. Basically my mind is scrambling and I am taking little snippets of conversations or moments we have had and obsessing over it. I need clarity with what to do next (not that I need to do anything) but my friend has recently shared some philosophical studies basically alluding to live life as if there is no tomorrow and I am wondering if I keep this to myself for too long I would never know what could or couldnt be and could potentially regret it in the future. Again i still adore my family friend and would hate to jeopardise my brothers friendship but I am CONFLICTED!! please help !! ",1,1755599112.0,whatdoIdo,3,0.67,False
