It's been a long time since I was a green bean and since it is the first time, I'm not really sure how quickly people pick up these new skills. But the barista I am training seems to be struggling a bit more than I would expect. They are pretty young and this is their first food service job. They have no knowledge of starbucks or coffee and after 3 hours of bar practice could not remember our sizes.every time we made a drink, they would pick up a random cup hoping it was the size on the sticker. I got them to understand the steam milk routuhe and how the bar itself works, but they can't seem to memorize even the most basic drinks after multiple repetitions. some drinks we even made 5 times in a row with no luck. I really just wanted to try to get them to remember how to make a latte, but it seemed nothing I said or did made it make sense. I usually started off by demonstrating the drink routine, walking them through it while they made it, then had them do it on their own and ""teach"" me how to make it. nothing ever clicked. and I know that recall helps with memorization so I periodically tried to quiz them on drinks we had made previously, but they were just drawing a blank. I made them a cheat sheet with the number of shots and syrups per drink to reference, but because they don't know which size is which, they just guessed when looking at my chart. I'm really unsure how to help them grow and feel like we've hit a roadblock. anyone have tips? I think if I had more time to train them, it would be okay, but we only have 2 more hours of scheduled training on bar and my manager said we can't get any more time... and at the rate we're going now, they won't be able to do any position once training is over because even register is a struggle   ",1,1747368950.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False
1kns0ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1kns0ly/sunroof_coffee_review/,Sunroof Coffee Review,"So Sunroof Coffee is a coffee shop at 175 Tracy St K5, and it's been open for about 2 years. I've been about a dozen times and wanted to tell y'all about it. It's become my go to coffee shop. It's just a shop when you order at the window and there's only outdoor seating. Definitely a very weather dependent vibe, so not a place to go to work. But the coffee is phenominal. I've had the iced shaken espresso, the cold brew latte, drip coffee and now the matcha latte. The employees are always incredibly nice and they have punch cards where you can earn a free coffee! Coffee is so rich and balanced in flavor, not overly acidic. The espresso drinks are creamy and rich. My favorite is the cold brew latte, it's just cold brew concentrate, oat milk, and vanilla. It has complex warm flavors, like brown sugar, and it's just so so so good. I recently tried the matcha latte and was pleasantly surprised. It's very mild, no weird wet grass flavor or bitterness. It was mildy sweet, bright, very earthy, and overall the best matcha latte I've found in athens. My only complaint is the area it's in. It's in a weird, liminal office (?) business park? Or maybe they're apartments. I had a really hard time finding it the first 2 times I went. But there's a large amount of free parking which is cool.

It was the healthiest relationship I have ever been in. We broke up over the phone on Saturday right before Mother's day while I was with my family. It was a bit of a messy breakup, but the relationship wasn't toxic at all. We made mistakes, but they didn't seem like relationship ending mistakes.

I texted her today and told her that I started therapy and that I do miss her and would like to talk. I asked if we could meet for coffee, and she responded and said she was busy and needed to think about whether we could meet in person. She also said the breakup is final and if the point of meeting is to get back together then she is ""not sure"".

I'm so confused as to how someone can say they care about me more than anyone they've dated before, and even talk to my Mom 2 days before initiating a breakup over the phone. She never communicated to me how bad things apparently were during the last few weeks, then threw all my mistakes at me on the phone. I guess I'm typing this because I'm still processing what happened. I'm not perfect, but I was planning a future and trying my best. 

I hope everyone else here is healing. ",1,1747368889.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

  So earlier, nasa coffee shop ako doing my things sa laptop, before pumasok ng work at 10am.  

A random girl , who looked like a college student , came up to me. At first, akala ko mag-aalok ng thesis aid na mabebenta.

  But then she said (non verbatim), “Miss, I’m sorry, I just really have to ask , I really like your body type. What workout do you do po?”  

I was literally dumbfounded, so nagpause pa ako saglit bago ko masagot.

  I could not stop smiling as I answered, “Grabe! Thank you?? Swap tayo? You have a better body type than me! But to answer your question, I just walk for about 30 minutes every day.”  

But honestly, she has that slim body type I actually prefer. As for me, I feel like I'm leaning more on the voluptuous side.  

We ended up chatting for about 20 minutes before she said goodbye. Before leaving, she even asked for my IG, so we exchanged socials.

  Napaisip tuloy ako kasi I’m quite insecure sa body ko, and that simple compliment gave me such a huge confidence boost. Words are powerful nga talaga.

Yazeed Yacoub, MSc, proudly announced his significant contributions to the Building Information Modeling (BIM) scope at Populous London for one of Saudi Arabia’s landmark sports venues, which is set to host the 2027 AFC Asian Cup and the 2034 World Cup. Yacoub described the experience as “an incredible design journey with a world-class team.”

Populous, renowned for its architectural excellence, was the lead architect for the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium project, overseeing all design aspects from the initial concept stages in 2014 to the completion of construction in 2019. The comprehensive development includes the stadium, a new visitor center, and the Club’s headquarters, with future plans for an extreme sports building and a hotel.

In collaboration with its sister company, Jump Studios, Populous designed the stadium’s general admission concourse spaces, featuring 61 bars, eateries, and coffee shops. Notable highlights of the project include three pub-style feature bars, a food court inspired by local street markets, and the world’s first in-stadium microbrewery, developed in partnership with Beavertown Brewery. Additionally, Populous and Jump Studios crafted the concept designs for the stadium’s premium hospitality areas, further enhancing the venue’s appeal.

The walk from Guui to Gangbyeon used to look like this:

* Out exit 3, walk along narrow road
* Pass motel on the right, see abandoned lot from former hotel on the left
* Pass by outdoor car repair place
* Walk by gas station
* Walk by school
* Walk by super crowded bus stops with pojangmachas on the left
* Cross the street, walk by smoking place, get to the station

Now the area out front has been turned into a big apartment complex with a mall, the Gu office, and Pullman Hotel coming soon. The walk is now:

* Out exit 3, walk along wide road with trees everywhere
* Pass 4-storey coffee shop on the right (they bought out the former motel), see SK apartment complex on the left
* Pass by small corner park
* Walk by building under construction (least fun part of the walk but building will be done around September)
* Walk by school
* Walk by super bus stops that are no longer crowded because most people going to Guri and Namyangju take the Line 8 now instead of coming to Gangbyeon to get on a bus. Also the pojangmachas are gone
* Cross the street, walk by place where you probably won't see anyone smoking because they crack down on it a bit now, get to the station

1knrl0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrincessCruises/comments/1knrl0i/cruise_review_majestic_princess_eastern/,"Cruise Review - Majestic Princess, Eastern Mediterranean","My husband and I, along with my sister and brother-in-law just competed a 10 day cruise on the Majestic. The itinerary was Venice (Trieste), Dubrovnik, Corfu, Crete, Kusadasi (Ephesus), Istanbul and Athens. This was our first cruise with Princess

Both couples had a mini-suite with the Plus package, and we added two days on either end of the cruise in Venice and Athens. The itinerary was fantastic, despite being bumped from Santorini  to Crete because of overcrowding and upgrades being made to the cable cars to get one from port to town.

First let's start with the ship. The Majestic is indeed a beautiful ship. Classy, uncrowded despite being almost fully booked, with a lot of public space for relaxing. Beautiful, spacious cabins, lovely dining rooms, and a staff that was beyond friendly and accommodating. There are a number of oddities in the space planning of the ship, a number of which have been addressed by other's reviews. Number one is the route to get to the Allegro dining room in the very aft of the ship on deck 6. I know it sounds strange, but it truly is a difficult path to learn, and it took us most of the cruise to remember how do it, depending on where you start the journey to get there. That said, it was a lovely space, reminded me a bit of a chic New York city dinner restaurant, that for the most part, had phenomenal waitstaff.

The menus were varied and full, and there were only a few dishes that we ordered for dinner (I'm speakikng about all four of us) that we decided were just ok, but for the most part, the offerings were very good, including the desserts. We are not gourmands, but we know good food, and I am baffled at the number of reviews I read prior to our departure that complained about the quality of their meals.

We avoided the buffet almost entirely as the number of people and noise in that atmosphere is just not what we were looking for, so I can't comment on the quality of the food there. We did have a dinner at the Crown Grill one night and were disappointed at the service and the lack of correct food preparation on a couple of the dishes we ordered. While the Crown Grill is probably the most beautiful of the restaurants as far as atmosphere, I would hesitate to again spend the extra money for the experience we had there.

The International Cafe and limited but quite good offerings for a quick breakfast, the coffees made to order and superior to the room service coffee.

The room service (included without extra charge for those on Plus) and the Oceans Now delivery were nearly flawless and quite speedy, but our orders were generally drink orders or morning coffee delivered to our cabin.

The entertainment onboard was varied and there were many venues to enjoy music and activities if one so was inclined. A few of the shows were just not up our alley so on the whole, I'd give a middle range rating.

Overall, we had a fantastic, memorable vacation on this cruise. One of the reasons we chose this sailing was that it had four days at sea, which is not that usual for the Mediterranean sailings. We were very glad to have that many days to relax and digest all that we had done on the private excursion bookings had done at each port.

Without a doubt, I would recommend Princess in general and the Majestic Princess in particular to my friends and family.

I'd be most happy to answer any specific questions people might have about the ship and/or our experience on the voyage.

1knrjel,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1knrjel/why_cant_i_feel_anything_help/,Why can’t I feel anything. Help.,"Idk how to make this mess short so please bear with me here I’m sorry for the rant . I’m 25M. When I was 18 I dated a girl for three years , the last 7 months of us dating she cheated on me with a girl. We had issues , her parents didn’t approve of me , I was insecure and I said things and acted in ways that didn’t help with her family thinking i was safe or good for her. Meanwhile I really did care and I wouldn’t have done anything to hurt her. But I know now I was blind and immature I did hurt her emotionally by not being aware/present enough and that’s probably why she cheated on me. I also didn’t ever want to break up , in my mind the stress and issues in time with work could have been resolved and I loved her too much to give up. In my mind it was giving up and I didn’t see my actions as toxic. I was wrong , and I do wish I could apologize for that to her now but the damage has been done , and it wouldn’t change anything. It wouldn’t to get back together or even be friends , just as a human I’m sorry. 

Fast forward to 21, I met a girl in my trade school . Imagine your typical scene from a movie , loser kid gets to talk to the girl all the guys want except he actually gets the girl….. almost. I didn’t want to like her bc all the other guys did and I heard what they’d say about her and it made me mad , also felt like I stood 0 chance ; she was powerful to me . Her and I would go out for lunch together all the time , she’d always buy me coffee . After classes we would go and drink in a lot together bc it was the only time we could make work , just to talk and know more .  We graduated, we began to open up about our feelings towards one another over the phone and I was in shock. 

It took months to hear from her once we graduated , I had my phase of tinder and “not looking for anything serious “ between then as I just wanted to not feel so alone and hurt , I thought the girl I wanted didn’t want me so I had to do what I had to do , in order to get her off my mind. Once again this was immature of me I know now bc it didn’t work and it was a waste of time and energy .

Fast forward again it’s been a year since I’ve seen her since graduation , she actually made time to come to my house . And I remember walking out to open her car door for her and walk her to my house ; I was shaking , I couldn’t walk or breathe. Yet when we got into my house we didn’t do anything spicy , we barely even spoke but she laid in my arms and I couldn’t believe it was real. That she’s really in my arms. I died and came back to life when we kissed. A few hours later she had to leave bc her mom called freaking out or something. ( she was 27 at the time why is your mom like that ? Also red flag In hindsight) 

We saw each other maybe three more times, two of those times was for me to lend her money to help her sick grandmother. This is when my red flags went off.  

I never saw her again , in fact I got no more texts either. I was worried she got hurt , died or ended up in jail.  I sent texts I called not like crazy but a few times through the day , the next day I stopped seeing delivered  on the messages. I got my friends phone and sent a text asking if she’s okay , and it went through. I know she blocked me at that point but I didn’t know why. Ashamed but admit to finding her grandmother on facebook just to see them going out to family parties dancing and she was healthy not in the hospital like I was told. 

At this point , my mental illness took full control and I decided to hurt her . I went all over every social media she had and made sure to rub all her woes , all her insecurities, all her pain and suffering in her face.  I went manic , i snapped. This is a low point I’ll never hit again , this is the moment that caused me to seek therapy and medication. This is a point I refuse to ever get to again.

Low and behold after saying the most volatile words to the woman that could make my heart stop just by eye contact , she responded . And it was actual paragraphs compared to before when things were “normal” and I’d never hear from her maybe a sentence if I’m lucky.  “You showed your true colors” ( me showing my true colors after saying I’m confused , can we communicate more , I don’t want to be too much for you and I know I am bc this triggers me so do you even want me around I can leave just talk to me im confused, but push me to my breaking point and when I snap yes , sit there and wonder why) she then ghosted me. 

Now it’s been years since , I’ve been dating my current gf for three years and I’m dedicated to her. But I genuinely don’t feel emotions anymore , like anhedonia. I feel pain , I feel regret , I feel hate towards me and others , I feel anger… but I can’t feel love . I’d do anything to make my current gf happy , she’s the reason why I STAY In therapy and my reminder.  I know I love her , I just I can’t feel anymore . Everything is numb since .

I’ve taken time to be single , to be alone , to be lonely , to force my self to enjoy it , just to realize I didn’t enjoy it . My current gf I met through a game , I felt feelings of trust for her before I knew her face . I trust her , and I’m attracted to her , she makes me happy and safe . But like depression , I can’t love the way I did  and I’ve tried to push her away bc she doesn’t deserve this. And it breaks me down bc I wish the way I felt for my ex , could be applied here but it’s like that part of me doesn’t work anymore .   But she holds me close and tells me how much she loves me and she understands me and sometimes I CAN feel the love so I don’t give up and I cry and apologize to her for being so delusional. 

I’m in therapy I’m working on it. Any ideas as to why I’m like this and anyone relate , how tf do I feel normal again

I'm the Mafia leader. I went to collect a debt and met a girl who was being abused. I will not tolerate this. -- ""You bimbo, can't you do one thing properly without making mistakes? You are a disappointment"" David roared and slapped her hard. This was my last straw. ""Enough! You jerk, how dare you slap her? I was going to give some time to return the money but now you will pay us back within a week."" ""Please don't do this. How will I gather 20 million in a week?"" He begged. Ignoring him, I walked toward that little girl. ""Don't need to be afraid anymore. I'll protect you for the rest life."" I held her in my arms and comforted her. ———————— Isabella It was almost 4 in the evening when I finished my work in a coffee shop, so I hurried my way to the house. I don't call that place home because home is where you feel safe and this place is my nightmare. I still have to prepare dinner and get ready. I reach at the house and go in the kitchen. I see that some chefs are already preparing the dinner. That means someone important is going to come. I was leaving the kitchen when my aunt suddenly saw me and held my arm in death grip, her fake nails were digging in my skin. She dragged me into the living room and snarled, ""If you are done whoring around like your mother go and get ready into something presentable. We don't want other people to know the bimbo that you are."" I whimpered as she roughly pushed me on the ground not before telling me to cover my bruises properly. Not wanting to cry I go into my room and start getting ready. I wear a simple red colored dress that has small white hearts and cover my visible bruises with makeup. I get ready and go upstairs to see if everything is perfect or not. I was arranging the couch cushions when my cousin Vanessa came downstairs wearing a very sheer black corset style dress. I wonder how she manages to breath in that dress. ""Eww! What are you wearing? It's so ugly but not as ugly as you."" Says the one with fake lips and nose job. My subconscious chided. I ignored her and continue what I was doing. Few minutes later my uncle and aunt came down in the living room. My uncle dragged me into a corner and threatened me, ""Keep your head down and don't talk unless you are told to. These people are dangerous and won't hesitate to put a bullet in your head. I really don't care but I have to keep you alive for next two years so don't mess up or you will regret it."" I meekly nodded yes sir and go into the kitchen. The chefs who came to prepare the food are long gone. I start to arrange the cutlery on the dining table when doorbell rang. I quietly go outside and see that my uncle opening the door. There entered three masterpieces of human but what shocked me more was that two of them were the same ones who came to the café in the morning. Two of them seem to be of same age but one of them looked a year or so younger. This is going to be a long night, I thought. Alexander I'm the Mafia leader. David Thompson is a vile man who borrowed 20 millions for his business few months but hasn't returned it. We warned him few days ago but he didn't responded so now we are going to his house. Nodding at him we went into my car. I sit at the driving seat, but Jacob and Nate are fighting to sit on the passenger seat. Childish much! I roll my eyes at them and shout, "" Sbrigatevi, cazzo ragazzi"" (hurry you guys). Jacob comes and sit on the passenger seat and Nate went to sit at the back with a pout. I roll my eyes at his antics. After driving for around half hour we reach his place. It is a medium sized house. Jacob rings the bell and David opened the door and ushered us inside. There were three women in the hallway. One of them was around David's age, I assume she is his wife. There were two other girls who looked like they were of same age. But I was shocked when I saw the same girl I saw at the café. I quickly cover my shocked expression with blank face. I'm here for business. David introduced his wife Veronica and his daughter Vanessa but didn't introduce the other girl. Jacob noticed that and asked, ""Who is she?"" pointing to her. David answered with a fake sweet smile that she is his niece Isabella. Isabella, it suits her. She is wearing a cute red dress with little hearts on it. She is looking beautiful even without wearing revealing clothes like Vanessa and Veronica. We made our way to the dining room. I had to sit next to Vanessa and God she can't keep he hands to herself. I saw Isabella sat across me. She started filling her plate when Veronica said, ""How much will you eat? You are already fat."" Isabella put back more than half of her food back. I am already getting irritated because of Vanessa's antics and now what Veronica did added fuel to my anger. I wanted this to be over already. We finish the dinner and go o David's study. I threatened him to give my money within a month or else he would be good as dead meat. After discussing few other things we went outside. David insisted to stay for drinks so we agreed. I sat on the couch and unfortunately that Vanessa came and sit beside me. No wait, she almost sat on my lap. I politely scooted a bit from her. I was annoyed by her behavior. Can't someone take a hint? Nate was snickering and Jacob was trying to control his laughter. I glared at them and they both shut up. Good for them. ... David ordered Isabella to do something and she left the room. Isabella came back in the room after few minutes and started serving drinks to everyone. Vanessa suddenly made Isabella stumble by putting her foot in the way. Luckily she didn't stumble and regained her balance. David suddenly got angry, ""You bimbo, can't you do one thing properly without making mistakes. You are a disappointment"" David roared and slapped her hard. All three of us were shocked but Vanessa and Veronica seemed unfazed by this behavior like it like this happens regularly. This was his last straw, ""Enough! hijo de puta, ¿cómo te atreves a abofetearla? (You jerk how dare you slap her?) I don't do business with people who hit women. Forget about the deal. I was going to give some time to return the money but now you will pay us back within a week."" We maybe mafia but we are taught not to put hands on women or children. Ma will whoop our asses if she finds out if we did anything. David started stammering and begging to give him some more time but we didn't pay any heed and left the house. After what happened in there I needed drink. I dropped Nathan and Jacob at house and then went to a club. I went into the VIP section and ordered my regular whiskey neat. There were so many women trying to get my attention but none of them appealed me so I went home. I took shower and went to bed. But I can't take Isabella out of my mind.

Is this an expat or Russian influence?
Did not seem like this in Tashkent, Ashgabat, Almaty, Samarkand, Dushanbe etc. although those cities seemed large and modern.  Certainly not like this in small towns like Khiva, Nukus or Penjikent. 
Had a fancy lunch at a place called Chinatown and a French 75, sushi roll and soup for my companion ran about $21 US.
How did Bishkek end up so much more expensive and less conservative than places like Tashkent and Dushanbe?  
Culture? Economy?  Oil money? Russians escaping Russia?
The way Ashgabat is like a Vegas Dubai Disneyworld cross was sort of understandable - natural gas money plus dictatorial paternalism where clean and orderly is prized.

1knri97,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1knri97/the_night_la_llorona_tried_to_enter/,The Night La Llorona Tried to Enter.,"The following is a real account of our experience in the rural coffee region of Colombia over the last several months. This all began in January, and it has taken us until very recently to uncover the full extent of the localized version of the legend surrounding La llorona, and piece together the experiences we have been having. We are thoroughly freaked out. 



We had just moved into our house—a secluded finca tucked into the hills near Río Espejo, where the trees drip mist and the river never sleeps. It was the kind of place you imagine as peaceful. Fertile. A place to start again.

My partner was four months pregnant, and we were excited but cautious, still adjusting to the rhythms of the land and the quiet.

It started in the first week.

Late at night, while we slept upstairs, her mother, brother, and sister—who were staying with us at the time—began to hear something. A voice. A woman’s voice, faint but urgent, floating in from just beyond the house.

“Ayúdame…”
“Help me…”

It didn’t come every night. But it came enough. First once. Then again. And by the second week, they had heard it three times, always around midnight to 3 a.m., always when the night was heavy with fog, and the river hummed louder than usual.

They said it wasn’t a scream. It wasn’t loud. It was worse than that.
It was soft. Pained. And human.

At first, they thought it was my partner calling for help from upstairs. After assuring them it wasn't her, they would look outside, thinking maybe someone was lost, maybe hurt. But there was never anyone there. The trees stood still. The night kept breathing. The voice faded away.

Then came the second week.

That night, my partner began to have sudden, severe pain. Cramping that felt like contractions. We were terrified—it was far too early for labor. We didn’t know what to do. We were upstairs, focused completely on her. And for reasons I still can’t explain, we didn’t have our phones with us. They were downstairs, forgotten in the rush of fear.

We thought we had ridden it out. By morning, the pain had eased. We were exhausted but relieved.

Until we spoke to the security guard at the front gate of our conjunto residencial.

He asked us what had happened the night before. We said, “Nothing… why?”

And he told us:

“An ambulance came to your house. Around 1 a.m. Someone called from here. From your property. Said there was a woman in distress.”

But we hadn’t called. No one in the house had.

And yet the ambulance arrived, lights flashing, knocking at the gate. Because we didn't answer his call, the security guard refused to let them enter. After waiting, they turned around and left—confused.

We were stunned.

That same night, the voice had been heard again by her family—closer this time, almost under the window. Again:

“Ayúdame…”

It wasn’t until we started asking around recently—neighbors, guards, even the older people in the nearby town—that we began to understand and put all of the pieces together.

We were told, very plainly:

“That’s La Llorona. You live near the river now. Pregnant women, crying children, and pain draw her in like blood in the water.”

But what's most terrifying to us is that here, in this part of Quindío—especially near Río Espejo and La Tebaida—the stories go deeper.

She doesn’t just cry by rivers anymore.
She doesn’t just appear in white veils.
They say La Llorona has learned how to use the modern world.

There are stories of:

- Phones ringing, and no one on the other end but weeping.

- Baby monitors catching whispers.

- Emergency services receiving calls from homes where no one made them.

- And just like us—ambulances showing up to rural houses in the night, responding to a cry for help that no human ever gave.

Some believe she’s not just a spirit anymore—she’s a pattern, a force, that clings to sorrow and technology alike. A kind of ghost intelligence, using whatever tools she can to get past the walls of a home. To be let in.

And they say if you respond to her voice—if you open the door, even out of kindness or confusion, you give her permission to enter.

We didn’t hear her that night. We didn’t open the door.
But she tried.

And maybe—because we didn’t answer—our baby is still safe. At least for now. Our daughter is 6 weeks old now and she is still trying to get in. At least now we know what we are up against. And we can't wait to move away from the river.

1knrhxn,https://i.redd.it/0p353gerf21f1.png,The LORE of Italian Brainrot,"After compiling different sources and making things up, I came up with this:

  
Seven original children were born: Tralalero Tralala, Lirili Larila, Chimpanzini Bananini, Bobrito Bandito, Trulemero Trulicima, Bombardino Crocadilo, and Bombini Gustini. They were experimented on at a young age by cruel human scientists. Each went on in their own way, some helping the world improve and become a better place, while others were driven by vengeance. Now only Tung Tung Tung... Sahur can save the world.



Tung Tung Tung... Sahur is an odd being from the Forestini Forest, a place on the Wooden Planet. Often spelled with two, three, four, five, seven, or ten ""Tung""s. 



Little is known about Bobrito Bandito, a top-secret detective working with Tralalero Tralala. Information about him cannot be revealed.



Bombardino Crocadilo was an evil crocodile who bombed the Forestini Forest, the homeland of Tung Tung Tung Sahur, destroying the town and killing Baby Tung, Tung Tung Tung Sahur's son, in the process.



Someone named Patapim found a gold hat, inside of it was a frog named Slim, who said ""brr, brr"". So Patapim met a wizard named Tiramisu and asked how to get rid of Slim. He was told to pop a balloon, and just like that, Slim disappeared.

This wizard had allied with Tralalero Tralala and his team, leading to the powerful being now known as Brr Brr Patapim allying with them.



Ballerina Cappuccina, married to Cappuccino Assassino, is a ballerina with a coffee cup head, who used to be a standard ballerina but drank coffee so much that she turned into a cappuccino. Cappuccino Assassino is a ninja cappuccino with great speed, he wields two katanas. He is a very powerful ninja being. The cappuccinos were married, but Cappuccino Assassino got kidnapped by Espressona Senora, who lied to Cappuccina leading to their divorce. They later remarried.



Tralalero Tralala had his child kidnapped by an evil human scientist named Tim. Tim hired Chimpanzini Bananini to battle, since Tung Tung Tung Sahur killed Bombardino Crocadilo.



Tung Tung Tung Sahur, speaking of which, went to fight Bombardino Crocadilo, and killed him, leading to Bombini Gustini hunting for Tung. He thought he had killed Tung Tung Sahur, but in reality Tung had faked his death, preparing for the larger battle with Chimpanzini Bananini.



Finally, Tralalero Tralala and Tung Tung Tung Sahur teamed up against Bombini Gustini and Chimpanzini Bananini, resulting in an epic battle which led to the Final Boss, the human Tim's last creation before his death. This was a combination of each brainrot character. Through discovery of lore, they returned to their normal state, and Tung Tung Tung... Sahur went on with Tralalero Tralala to save the world.



During all of this, Espressona Senora had been planning to take over the world, and Tung Tung Tung Sahur had finally begun catching on. In the midst of all of this, after the stopping of Chimpanzini Bananini and the slow rise of Espressona Senora, a new, mysterious character would arise. One that no one could anticipate, one that would serve as Espressona Senora's greatest ally, one even more powerful than the final boss, one that Tung Tung Tung... Sahur and Tralalero Tralala could not beat. One more powerful than any other character, one not yet known as an Italian Brainrot character, one more intelligent than any other creature. This is a character no one could have anticipated. No one could have anticipated the rise of Super Aikerini Pastini...",1,1747367203.0,ItalianBrainrot,1,1.0,False

 I'm building something to help!

To make this tool truly effective, I'd love to get your input on a few key questions (feel free to answer just one!): 

 **1. What triggers those feelings of being mentally or emotionally ""off"" for you during your workday?** Is it pre-Zoom anxiety, the afternoon slump, critical feedback, analysis paralysis, micro managing, breakdown in hybrid communications, technology issues or something else? 

**2. What do you \*currently\* do to cope with those feelings?** Scroll social media, grab coffee, take a walk, try to power through, use an app, complain/vent to a coworker, internalize, or nothing at all? 

**3. If you had a 2-minute tool to help you emotionally reset and improve your day to day work experience, what \*must\* it solve, include, or not include to encourage you to use it?** Calming audio, breathing cues, visuals, affirmations, movement prompts, mood tracking, clearer management insights on employee energetic flow, more autonomy in scheduling  

**4. If you are not familiar with any of these wellness modalities, on a scale from 1 (not at all)- 10 (very interested), how would you rank your willingness to try a program like this? Wha significant factors would impact your decision?**  (not enough time, lack of understanding as to how this benefits me, not interested if it doesn't somehow communicate and/or have the potential to improve my relationship with upper management)  

**5. (Optional) Are you into things like numerology, moon cycles, or energy-based planning? Or is that a little too ""out there"" for your work life?**

They started 2 years ago while in college. In the middle of class i felt my heart pounding and shortness of breath. I had to rush outside the classroom thinking i was having a heart attack, who wouldn’t? if i was having the exact symptoms of it. In many instances in the middle of the night i would get low heart rate notifications from my watch which made me think my heart was going to stop beating at any time. I could also barely feel my heart beat when this happened. Imagine all the anxiety this induced on me. I remember having many episodes a week and having to rush to emergency room at the middle of the night in 3 occasions, just to be told by the doctors that my ekg and everything else was fine. In some other occasions I would sleep in my car in the parking lot of hospitals just in case my symptoms would come i would be close to help, plus i was already getting in debt from previous ER visits. I even ended up buying an apple watch just for the EKG and heart rate functions, which helped by letting me know i wasn’t having a heart attack and that my heart was still pumping. I visited many specialist including cardiologist, pulmonologist, endocrinologist, etc. The only thing found was mild asthma with mild lung obstruction. Pulmonologist said he didn’t knew the causes of these conditions and referred me to the allergist which did a skin prick test that helped in no way. Some doctors even suspected me of suffering from anxiety, which I found very frustrating since  the people that know me know im a pretty relaxed and mindful guy, and I’ve never suffered from this, and im exposed on a daily basis to stressful situations. In any case the symptoms i was having were inducing anxiety on me. I did LOTS of research and suspected that I might have a hiatal hernia. So i scheduled an appointment with the GI. She sent me for a endoscopy, in which a hiatal hernia wasn’t found, but they found I had mild gastritis and EOE. I was prescribed pantoprazole. Until this day im not fully cured but im way better, sometimes i get pounding heart, and difficulty swallowing, but rarely any shortness of breath. Ive found that when i stop drinking coffee i barely have any symptoms. But i dont think its the caffeine, its the coffee itself since drinking energy drinks or tea doesnt make me feel bad. Until this day i keep battling to try to feel as before that day in college, trying to feel like the old me, the fully healthy me. My mental health has taken a big hit because of this, and im also slowly recovering from that. I wont stop trying until i find exactly whats causing me to feel like this, and when I find the cause I will share it, so if anyone else is suffering this, they can benefit from it.

You can track your history, view trends, and get insights over time.

The app lets you see calendar-based patterns, unlock badges based on consistency or challenges, and explore short articles on gut health. It also tracks your location (privately) so you can spot how travel or environment might affect things. You can log food types and period data too, and see how those factors correlate with changes.

As luck would have it yelling ""Oh Shit!"" as opposed to actually having the reflexes to catch it...spoiler alert it cracked on the cement floor of the warehouse! Perhaps it seems silly but drinking garbage coffee in this mug was the highlight of my break or lunch. 

 So here I am asking if anyone knows where to replace this type of mug without spending $40 on Amazon. I want the one in the back of a millennial parents coffee mug collection.

PS: Excuse my english it’s not my first language :) 

D-2: i had my morning coffee, white toast with cream cheese. A wrap with chicken breast at lunch. Another chicken sandwich for dinner. 2 tablets of laxatives at midnight right before bed
 —-> I was a bit confused on what should i eat it was not clear and this is not what i usually eat. I am used to salads lol. I was SO hungry it felt like a diet. 
D-1: very interesting. I had a black coffee at 8 and head to the office (wow) all day long I had apple juice, lemon vitamin water and regular water. I was NOT HUNGRY at all which was very weird I usually snack every 1hr lol. 
I brought with me 2L of PEGlyte in 4 small bottles of 500ml. I started at 5pm and thought I would do one bottle per 30 min as I had to finish 2L in 2hours. PEGlyte is both salty and sweet. I had the best advice of mixing it with Distilled water instead of any other water. I could handle the taste even though I am very picky about tastes. But it’s the feeling of drinking a lot of water on an empty stomach that makes it difficult. What i did is drinking a lot in one shot and stop for 15 min and then drinking it again. 
After ~700ML i felt like i needed to go to the washrooms and it was like the beginning of diarrhoea. I had to stop after this because it was 6pm and I had to take the subway to go home. Not ideal lol. 
At 7pm i was home and started drinking peglyte again. I was then finishing every shot of peglyte with apple juice and it was revolutionary. I was going to the toilet every 5 min and at this time it was basically just liquid. But not clear yet. 
I finished the first 2L at 8h20 instead of 7pm. I took 2 other tablets of laxatives at 9pm and started peglyte again at 10pm. No straw no nothing just a big shot followed by apple juice. 
I finished the other 1.5L at midnight. i did not finish the 4L because at this time it was probably just a clear pale yellow liquid as stool. But the urge to go to the washroom did not stop until around 1 am. I went to sleep and woke up at around 2.30 am to throw up. I didn’t feel any need to throw up while drinking peglyte but it happened when i was sleeping. 

The day : appointment at 11. Last thing i drunk was the peglyte the night before. Nurses and doctors made me feel so comfortable. My main concern was anaesthesia. I have never ever had that and didnt know how it felt. I was so scared. They put a needle in my arm and a thingy in my mouth. The thingy sprays something in my mouth and in 3,2,1 i fall asleep. I wake up 45 min later. It felt like a good night of sleep. I was not hurt i did not feel anything. I was just sleepy. Blurry memories of leaving the clinic and the ride back home. Nothing was hurting. I was just feeling so bloated and full of gas.

We’re a couple with a dog (no plans for kids in the near future), and we’re exploring ways to improve the layout of our existing home. We'd really appreciate your thoughts and suggestions on how to better use our space!

Our main priorities:

A spacious living room (we’re thinking of placing it in the northeast corner).

A functional kitchen —we'd like to keep it in its current location but want to improve the layout by adding more counter space and storage. A dedicated coffee area would be great too.

Other notes:

The main entrance is on the west side.

We’re unsure how to make the best use of the space near the entrance — open to ideas!

We're flexible on moving walls, plumbing, and electrical if it helps create a better layout.

The reason being that one of his close family members passed away a couple of months ago and I did not show up for him for a couple of days. I was present on the day we got the news,  I was present the next day (day2) too for his family dinner, the next day (day3), I asked him to help me fix a coffee table thinking this will distract him a little and would be a bonding moment for us. He did try to help but we ended up fighting while fixing it. I already had a lot of unresolved issues with him way before we got the news of his family member passing away, I ignored it all and supported him, but the day we fought- I was really distressed from the fight with him and I had also had an intense argument with my mom on the same day, I was not feeling emotionally stable to be a support for him for his family dinner. The next day , 2 of my close friends got really sick (friends that I call family and they are the only family I have in this country)- I went to meet them since they have always been there for me whenever I fell sick. I had communicated this to my boyfriend and he seemed fine with it at the time. The next day (5th day after his family member passing away), he sent me long text messages that Iam not being a great support for him. I apologized, agreed and I did my best to be his support for the next 2 months. I helped him with moving (packing), I painted his house (even while I was sick), I attended his family gatherings (while I was sick), I attended the funeral and was with him the entire time. Before the funeral, and even after the funeral- I let him sleep at my house for about 3 months(he had some neighbor issues at his place at the time), during these 3 months a lot of days we ended up fighting for hours, to the extent where it was affecting my health, I felt like breaking up but I didn’t and I still let him sleep in my bedroom while I slept on the couch with my cat (he is allergic to my cat and my cat is clingy). 

Now he sold that house where he was having trouble sleeping, got a new job at a different city and he broke up with me 2 weeks before he is suppose to move to the new city. Reason according to him is that I was not there for him when he needed me the most (I have apologized multiple times for this and also given evidence that I have showed up for him a lot many other times). 
And the reason why I thought it was okay to miss for those two times was in the past, we had an incident where he had abandoned me and we had a long fight on that- and as a resolution being - we both had agreed that we would be vocal with each other if we want the other person to show up for us. 
When he asked me for family dinners for those two days he was more of the tone like “if” I can join and not that he wanted to me show up. In my head I thought- I have already been there for him for the last couple of days, now it’s time for me to show up for my friends and me (just for those 2 days). I had no intention of abandoning him in any way and whether he asked me or not- I was gonna be there for him for the rest of the days. Now his argument is that since he asked me- I showed up and that didn’t feel genuine to him. 

Iam left feeling like I did everything in my capacity and poured a lot of me into this relationship but in the end he invalidated all of my efforts.

I'm in my late 20s and male. I used to weigh around 120 kg and managed to bring it down to 107, but I’ve recently gone back up to 110. I've been accepted for a scholarship and would really like to reach around 100 kg (ideally 95 kg if I push hard) by mid-September. I know that’s quite ambitious, but I just want to see consistent weight loss to keep myself motivated.

I walk about 10,000 steps a day (tracked with a pedometer) at a speed of 4.7 km/h. On some days, I use the treadmill and hit around 20,000 steps, those days my average speed hits around 5.2 km/h. I walk to and from work. While my job is mostly desk-based, I'm fairly active overall.

I lift weights at least 3 times a week and up to 5 times when my schedule allows. I train using a Push-Pull-Legs (PPL) split and lift fairly heavy. For example, I leg press about 120 kg, my back exercises (rows and pulls) are around 60 kg, and my chest press is currently at 80 kg. I’ve seen noticeable muscle development in my chest, arms, and legs—but I’m still holding onto weight around my stomach, and it’s very noticeable.

I’m trying to stick to a calorie deficit, but I often end up eating more—especially after intense workouts. I used to consume about 1500 calories a day before I started training, and dropping below that has been tough. I went down to 1200 calories for a while, which worked initially, but I’m afraid I’ll have to go even lower, which doesn’t feel sustainable.

I prepare my own meals and use as little oil as possible. My diet is mostly protein-heavy, and I use low-fat milk in my coffee whenever I can. My diet is low carb and full of vegetables mostly.

So I'm doing pretty good right now but last year I had a stressful time, started having a slowly growing amount of paranoia and a lot more sensing spiritual entities.... which kinda led me to thinking I had schizotypal cause it all fit(even though occasionally it mostly went away). 
But instead of taking the subreddit like a support group for people with a personality disorder I kinda just fit myself in since in my mind schizotypal people were just people who could genuinely sense entities and had some level or telepathy, and hey I can relate with everyone! 

(And I tried to be able to communicate with spiritual entities more while genuinely ignoring the times others said it was a symptom) 

Add in stress and I just snowballed with paranoia and alot more things. Then I realized schizotypas was an actual personality disorder, and I thought that I was clearly spiritual so I ""graduated"" to other communities with people just straight up not really suggesting they had an issue. (Thankfully I was still in spaces supportive of mental health). 
Heck I joined occult spaces on discord and got told to talk to a therapist cause I brought up telepathy... uh I eventually did. Mostly due to my paranoia just getting worse to the point that it started involving things recording my thoughts and I couldn't drink coffee at all without getting convinced of certain things. 

(All this would stop for a little when I stopped being stressed but eventually cMe back). For a lot of this time I was hearing voices when stressed and communicating to entities. 
And I talked to a therapist about my paranoia issues and added in info about the other stuff and... idk I'm making a choice not to go on any subreddits that are spiritual or related to weird thing.
Thing is I did have some small level of ""I have telepathy/I can practice and develop telekinesis"" it just was at a really low level and then I managed to make the whole thing skyrocket 

I'm fine now so I don't think it was me developing schizophrenia. I hope

Marco's pov

Homeroom felt more like a fridge than a classroom. The windows rattled faintly in their frames, and I could see the gum trees outside swaying in the wind like they were already giving up on summer. It was mid-February, technically still summer, but the cold had crept in early this year—sharp winds, grey skies, breath hanging just a little too long in the air.

Half the class had pulled their jumpers out from the bottom of their bags. Eren, predictably, still wore his hoodie like a security blanket. I had my blazer on, fingers curled around a warm travel mug my mum insisted I take this morning. Apple and cinnamon tea. It helped.

I was halfway through rewriting my Modern History summary notes when the door opened.

Ms. Ral walked in, clipboard tucked under her arm, followed by someone new. Heads turned. Chairs creaked. Even Sasha paused mid-sip of her iced coffee.

“We’ve got a new student joining us today,” Ms. Ral said. “Transferred in from Trost. This is Jean Kirstein. Play nice.”

Jean looked like he’d rather be anywhere else. Tall, lean, sharp-edged. His brown hair was styled back but wind-blown from the walk across the quad. His uniform was technically correct, but his tie was loose and the top button of his shirt undone. The sleeves of his blazer were slightly too long, like he hadn’t had time to get it tailored.

Ms. Ral looked at me next.

“Marco, he’s your buddy. Show him around, help him settle in.”

I nodded instinctively. “Yes, ma'am.”

Jean glanced toward the empty seat beside me with the expression of someone sizing up a lifeboat they didn’t ask for. But he walked over and sat down, dropping his bag beside his chair with a soft thump.

“Hey,” I offered, smiling. “I’m Marco.”

He gave a small nod. “Jean.”

The chill in the room didn’t just come from the air conditioning. Jean sat stiffly, arms crossed, staring ahead like he was bracing for something. He didn’t take his books out, just looked out the window, jaw tense. I wasn’t sure if it was nerves or something else, but I didn’t push.

Ms. Ral moved on to attendance and updates, the usual Monday stuff. I could hear Hitch whisper something behind me and giggle—probably about the new guy. People were already whispering. Transfers in Year 12 weren’t normal, and Jean didn’t exactly scream “open book.”

When the bell rang, I stood and looked over at him.

“First period’s English,” I said. “It’s in C Block. Want me to show you?”

Jean stood slowly. “Yeah. Thanks.”

We walked out into the hallway together. The breeze cut through the open walkway like a knife, and both of us instinctively tucked our chins deeper into our collars.

“You got stuck with English, History, PE, and Legal, right?” I asked.

“Pretty much whatever was open,” he said. “Didn’t get much of a say.”

“Still no math, though. So that’s a win.”

That got the faintest curve of a smile from him.

The path between buildings was scattered with dry leaves—brown, brittle, crunching under our shoes. The air smelled faintly of damp eucalyptus and cold metal. Jean didn’t talk much, but he kept pace with me.

“Is it weird starting over now?” I asked.

Jean shrugged. “Better than staying where I was.”

I didn’t ask what that meant. Yet.

When we reached the English room, I held the door open.

“This is 12C English,” I said. “Mr. Jinn teaches it. He’s a bit dramatic, but he’ll like you if you quote anything vaguely literary.”

Jean stepped in, paused, then looked at me with something more like curiosity than discomfort.

“You always this helpful?”

I shrugged. “Occupational hazard.”

He looked at me for a moment, like he didn’t quite know what to make of me.

Then: “Thanks.”

Short, quiet—but it felt like something real.

And for now, that was enough.

The classroom smelled faintly of old paper and dry-erase markers, warmed by the heater humming softly in the corner. Jean and I took seats near the middle of the room—me by habit, him because he followed.

Mr. Jinn strode in two minutes after the bell, wearing a navy turtleneck and thick glasses that always slid halfway down his nose. He clapped his hands once like he was commanding attention on a stage.

“Today,” he announced, “we’re writing poetry. Don’t groan. This isn’t Shakespeare. This is you.”

A few people groaned anyway. Sasha laid her head dramatically on her desk. Jean just blinked.

“I want a single free verse poem,” Mr. Jinn continued, “based on your life right now. One page max. Doesn’t need to rhyme, but it does need to feel honest.”

I stared down at my notebook.

Honest.

A dozen university brochures flashed through my head—emails from places I couldn’t even point to on a map, application deadlines highlighted in neon on the family calendar, late nights spent wondering if I was making decisions for the right reasons or just making them because everyone expected me to.

I picked up my pen.

“Decision Season”
By Marco Bodt
They say I could go anywhere.
Across oceans, over borders, through ivy-covered halls.
Oxford. Keio. UBC. ANU.
They say I’m wanted.
They say I’m lucky.
They say I should be excited.
But mostly, I’m tired.
Mostly, I feel like a resume
shaped like a seventeen-year-old.
Every choice feels like a fork in a forest I’ve never been to.
And all I want is to breathe without thinking about tomorrow.
Just for one day.

I stopped writing. The class was quiet except for scratching pens and the occasional sniffle. I glanced sideways at Jean, who was still staring at his blank page like it had personally offended him.

He noticed me looking and muttered, “I don’t do poetry.”

I smiled faintly. “Lucky for you, Jinn just wants honesty.”

Jean looked at me like that was the bigger challenge.

I don’t know what I expected when I walked into the library for my first tutoring session—maybe a Year 10 kid nervously flipping through a textbook, or someone shy who’d pretend not to understand basic algebra just to get out of doing it.

What I didn’t expect was Eren Yeager.

He was already there when I arrived, slouched in a seat like it had personally offended him. Hood up, legs sprawled, his backpack dumped on the floor like it exploded on impact. He looked like he was waiting for detention, not help.

“You’re my tutor?” he said the moment he saw me, raising one eyebrow like it was the most personally disappointing news he’d ever received.

I sat down across from him. “Apparently.”

We’d been in the same classes for years, but we weren’t exactly close. He was loud. I was quiet. He argued with teachers. I didn’t. He once threw a desk leg at a whiteboard when a relief teacher got Stalin and Lenin mixed up. It missed, but the message landed.

“Great,” he muttered. “Just great.”

I pulled my folder out and tried to sound neutral. “I’ve got your progress sheet here. Looks like you’re falling behind in Modern History.”

“No shit.”

There was a beat of silence. I glanced at the study guide. “So. The Cold War?”

He leaned back in his chair like it might protect him from the next forty-five minutes.

“Can you just… I don’t know. Tell me what I need to know so I don’t fail?”

It was tempting to recite the syllabus and walk away, but that wasn’t the job. And, stupidly, I kind of wanted to prove I could do this.

“Alright,” I said, flipping to a page I’d highlighted earlier. “Let’s start simple. Do you know what the Iron Curtain is?”

“Yeah,” he said immediately. “A metal curtain that—like—cut Europe in half or whatever.”

I blinked. “No.”

He frowned. “Well, I thought I knew.”

“It’s a metaphor, Eren.”

“Oh. Well maybe don’t ask trick questions, Marco.”

I sighed and kept going.

Tutoring Eren was like teaching a very talkative Labrador with no attention span. Every time I explained something, he interrupted with a question that spiraled into a conspiracy theory, a rant about how school was designed to crush people’s souls, or an aggressively personal opinion about American foreign policy.

But the weirdest part was… he stayed.

And listened.

And sometimes, he got it.

I drew a cartoon on the back of a worksheet—two guys yelling over a TV remote, each claiming they had the right to change the channel while the other refused to back down. “This is the U.S. and the Soviet Union during the Cold War,” I said. “Both want influence. Neither wants to give it up.”

Eren stared at it. Then snorted.

“That’s actually kind of good.”

I blinked. “Wait, really?”

“Yeah. Like, it’s stupid—but it works.”

By the end of the session, he’d filled in a worksheet. Badly, but it was filled. That alone felt like a miracle. As we packed up, he looked at me sideways.

“You’re not as annoying as I thought you’d be.”

“Thanks,” I said. “I think.”

He nodded toward the paper. “Same time next week?”

I wasn’t sure if it was a threat or a question. “Sure.”

He left the library in the same chaotic swirl of limbs he arrived with.

I sat there a few minutes longer, watching the dust float through the light, feeling a little less like I was falling behind myself. Maybe this tutoring thing wouldn’t fix everything. But it was something real. Something mine.

And for now, that was enough.

After Eren left the library like a one-man hurricane, I packed up slowly, feeling weirdly… okay.

Not proud, exactly. But like I’d done something that mattered, even if it was just convincing Eren Yeager that Stalin and Lenin weren’t cousins. I slipped my notes into my folder and headed down the hall toward Student Services to log the session.

The admin office smelled like dry paper and weak instant coffee. I nodded at the receptionist, who didn’t look up from her screen, then stepped into the side room labeled Tutoring Program – Logs and Hours. It was basically a glorified storage closet with a sign-in folder and a couple of clipboards hanging from thumbtacks.

As I started filling out the form—Name: Marco Bodt. Session type: Peer tutoring. Subject: Modern History. Notes: Iron Curtain / Cold War basics—I heard voices drifting in from the open admin office.

Two teacher aides were talking just outside the doorway.

“I heard they’re transferring him from one of the city schools,” one said, voice low but not exactly secretive. “Something about family stuff, maybe behavioural? Poor kid’s been bounced around like crazy.”

“Is he from interstate?”

“Mm, maybe. I saw paperwork for Sydney. But the application had European documents too—France or Switzerland or something? It’s all kind of vague.”

“Do we know when he’s starting?”

“Term’s already halfway in. Could be anytime.”

They both went quiet for a moment, then one of them added, “Honestly, if they want him to settle, this school might be the first place that sticks. Sina High’s got its mess, but at least we try.”

There was a rustle of papers. A door closed softly.

I stood there for a few seconds, pen still in hand. I don’t know why I felt the need to listen so closely. It wasn’t like I knew whoever they were talking about.

But something about it stuck in my head.

Maybe it was the way they said “settle,” like this person had been drifting for a while. Or maybe it was because, despite all my lists and plans and university pamphlets, I knew a little bit about feeling unmoored.

I logged the time, capped the pen, and left the room.

I've been on ADHD meds which have helped with focus (albeit not so much with dexterity issues). I recently started taking supplements daily because why not (about a month ago), and about a week ago I noticed I felt way different. 
I feel less craving or obsessive with regard to buying stuff or food—I get some anhedonia that people talk about, and given my mood swings that does concern me, but I do like that I eat or buy things more intentionally, rather than buying stuff out of low impulse control and a craving for dopamine. I’m not totally protected from mood swings but I feel more resilient, more assertive and more confident as well as more goal-driven; on the whole I feel more “manly”, but in a mature way rather than something cartoony. 
I do still sometimes get the overthinking and “analysis paralysis” comes with OCD, which really can drive alot of bad decisions, but it does seem to happen less; the intrusive thoughts are much less common. As mentioned before, I still do get mood swings at time—(I found out coffee treats that way better than energy drinks, as a side note).

I suspect alot of these changes are driven by the ashwagandha (I take 600 mg of KSM-66, for reference). I’ve noticed I feel groggy throughout much of the day—researched and found out I should take it at night instead.

I wanted advice on how adding in l-theanine would help me or hinder me, and/or further advice with ashwagandha (“cycling it” as I’ve heard people talk about)

with this hairstyle. 

The Aishi condition would no longer be a thing and Ayano would slowly develop a condition where she can barely form emotion due to being neglected by her mother and abused by her father.

Student Council would wear a beige blazer seen on the Game Asset Studio Models

There'd be Four Rivals
- Kokona
- Oka
- Asu
- Megami

Canon Elimination
Kokona - Befriend
Oka - Suicide
Asu - Drowning
Megami - Ruining her Reputation Enough to Move Schools

Time Frame

Fall/Winter of 2014

Kokona on September 15th-19th
Oka on October 17th-22nd
Asu on November 4th-7th
Megami on December 24th-29th

The days during the week where you're not attending school you can spend stalking the rival, working as a barista in a coffee shop, going into town to buy things, and torturing people.

Kokona's Befriend Mission

Kokona would converse with Saki while Ayano is Spying on them as usual. Ayano would arrange a meeting with Kokona discussing her Father's debt. Once Ayano figures out who is responsible for this she'll sneak into the Rokuda household in the middle of the night. There she'd suffocate Mutsumi to death, hide her corpse in a giant suitcase, and bring it to Ayano's home. You'd take Mutsumi's corpse, stitch her eyelids open, and pose her as if she were screaming. Take an image of her and send it anonymously through a burner phone with a vpn to Mr. Rokuda. Ayano'd threaten him to free all his clients from debt and ask him for 985,000 Yen. He'd send her the money anonymously to a discreet location. Ayano would dispose of Mutsumi's Corpse by dumping it into a river and pick up the envelope of cash. 


Effects of Mutsumi's Passing
Due to Mutsumi no longer attending the school, the bullies would be led by Hoshiko Mizudori. Hoshiko is much crueler than Mutsumi and attempts to manipulate the other three bullies remaining into doing more extreme methods of ""bullying"" such as burning students with cigarettes and lighters, cutting them up with sharp objects, and beating them with items around the school. Kokoro sees through Hoshiko and decides to leave the bullies which makes her a target for bullying. Kokoro decides to join the occult club.

Megami's Canon Elimination

Megami wouldn't be the perfect girl we all know in the current game. She'd have a shorter temper and make a few mistakes every now and then. You could spy on Megami and take images of her doing things such as tripping and spilling things onto other people. You'd be able to print these images out and hang them around the school which will lower her Reputation. One of the student council members will discuss this during lunch time (Most likely Shiromj) which will cause Megami to lash out at her. You could record this out of context and edit it by joining the Photography club. Then you could send this to the bullies phones and previous friends you've made (Minimum is Kokona as in this AU she'd be loud mouthed and can't keep a secret). Megami would be bullied so relentlessly that she'd no longer want to attend the high school and would withdraw. Leaving Kuroko as the president as no one else was involved in the election.

During the Student council election, the school would go through a massive renovation, there'd be atleast 2 or 3 students joining the school every two days, and students would become much more intelligent. An example of renovation would be curtains around every window including doors, desks being separated from chairs, every chair having wheels, and better lighting in the school. Students would be able to notice blood and bodies much more quickly due to this new lighting and would have much better hearing than previously. Students can now also see through windows which is where curtains come in. Classrooms would also be locked during lunch time and unlocked during class time. Students would also be able to distinguish a regular trash bag and a body bag now. Students council will also now tase Ayano after two pushes instead of four like normal.



Endings

There'd be three

- Genocide ending
- Snap Ending (Two Ways)
- Jail Ending (Canon)

The Snap ending would be either achieved through how it is normally in game, or through the ending by catching Taro (I will elaborate on this)

Jail Ending is a reference to Yuka Takaoka (The IRL Yandere) where Ayano spies on Taro at work and sees him speaking with a Female Co Worker. Later that night, she'd stab Taro with a kitchen knife into him abdomen. He'd run out of their home into a blizzard and attempts to run towards the nearest hospital. He passes out near a local police station where they discover him and immediately take him to the ER. Upon waking up, Taro would be question on what happened where'd he'd confess that Ayano was the person whom he'd been attacked by. She'd be promptly arrested and sentenced to either life in prison or sent to a mental asylum (Haven't decided Yet) There'd be a chase sequence where you can successfully chase after and catch Taro trying to run away. You'd tackle him and get into a fight which ends in you slitting both Taro's and your throats.",5,1747363203.0,RyobaAishi,2,1.0,False

I’ve been using the Fellow coffee maker for the past 5–6 months, and overall it’s been great. However, the carafe has become badly stained from coffee over time (stained from week 1 of using it) and it just doesn’t look good anymore. I’ve tried cleaning it multiple times, but the stains seem permanent at this point.

Has anyone else experienced this? Any tips or suggestions on how to get rid of those tough coffee stains? I’d really appreciate any advice!",1,1747363120.0,FellowProducts,17,1.0,False

Beautiful, spoiled, well-spoken, and dangerous in the sweetest way.

You’re here because you need something.
My attention. My voice. My approval.
Or maybe you’re just hoping I’ll humiliate the part of you you’re too ashamed to show anyone else.

I don’t just want your money.
I want your submission in every form it comes in.

🖤 What I Enjoy:
	•	Financial Domination – I take because I can. You give because you need to.
	•	Humiliation & Degradation – Soft words or sharp cruelty, depending on what you deserve.
	•	Drain sessions & voice calls – I talk, you melt. You pay, I take.
	•	Obedience play, control, and training – I mold weak minds into devoted pets.
	•	Worship – Feet, voice, intellect, and superiority. Choose your altar.



💸 My Ideal Submissive:
	•	You give consistently without whining or conditions.
	•	You understand that Findom is about loss of control, not bargaining.
	•	You crave being used, teased, or put in your place whether that’s playful embarrassment or something more intense.
	•	You get hard knowing I’ll forget your name but keep your money.


🧋 Roles I Love Having in My Lineup:
	•	Coffee/food subs who pay for my cravings
	•	Long-term tributers who quietly send without fuss
	•	Voice-obsessed weaklings who pay just to hear me drain them
	•	Debt contract boys who need structure & punishment
	•	Humiliation pets who get off being reminded they’ll never be enough
	•	Big spenders who need a Black Goddess to break them

I may already have some of these 
But I’m always open to more if you’re obedient, consistent, and know your place.


📎 How to Approach:
	1.	Start with tribute. No tribute = no attention.
	2.	Introduce yourself with purpose. Who are you? What do you crave?
	3.	Be real. Be ready. No “maybe later” energy here.



You’re not just paying me.
You’re paying for the privilege of proximity.
Make your presence worth my attentionor stay a silent admirer.

here are some different types of **founders(only bad ones, will talk about good ones some other day)**:  
\-> **I know it All founder**  
these kind of people want a lion to climb trees, a monkey to roar and hunt elephants, cuz they themselves are not aware what to ask and whom to ask but are not ready to take any advise from people who know the stuff  
\-> **The micro manager founder**  
they lack trust in their employees and try to dig into each and every minute thing, focusing less on the right things which actually add value  
\-> **The gaslighting founder**  
they are understaffed and overload employees with a lot of work and gaslight employees into toxic late hours, create fake urgencies almost every other day  
\-> **The Aladdin(genie version) founder**  
especially founders with almost 0 technical knowledge of stuff, they don't understand the process, timeline,  and how, why and when things are to be done, they just have an attitude like you read a magic spell and booom, the product gets shipped  
\-> **The Aladdin(dictator version) founder**  
they own their employees, the employees are basically paid slave, they might lock you out of office if you come a bit late, they might ask a software developer to get coffee for them, you are paid by them so you are bound to satisfy their ego and lick their boots and what not  
\-> **The freeloaders**  
what have you done ? are you building a rocket here ? so just keep 2 cents and be happy that you are even employed by me. they don't want to pay decently and make you feel like you are not worth it  
a very common thing among these founders is **hire and fire quick, no stability**  
so what is common in these companies, that might kill the startup:  
\-> good/skilled employees never stay for long, they are out at the first opportunity they get  
\-> the products becomes extremely shitty if the talent is unfit, or too may people work for very short period of time and on tight deadlines, then they leave, so this pattern makes the codebase a pile of p\*g shit no body likes to work with  
\-> there is always a sense of fear, everyday employees are insecure about their job and worried about their bills/responsibilities, so basically a very bad environment for any good thing to be accomplished  
\-> firing someone who knows ins and outs of the product, better luck finding the right replacement as quickly as possible without impacting growth. there is always a guy or a small group, they run the show there, so if you bite them, it will make things harder  
\-> relying too much on jr talent for critical decisions, they don't have the right amount of experience and some mistakes can impact you heavily, so respect experience and let the right people do the job  
\-> don't set your hiring criteria like FAANG, if you pay like Tom's bakery, it's a two way street, if you are having standards, then people with good skills do have them, so try to find a balance",1,1747362522.0,cscareerquestions,0,0.67,False

It wasn't my resume. It wasn't my experience. It was how I was practicing.

For months, I'd been doing what everyone recommends—talking to my computer screen, recording myself, using those AI interview prep tools. But my breakthrough came when I stopped talking to pixels and started talking to people.

**Here's what I discovered:** The key to nailing interviews isn't just preparation—it's HUMAN preparation. 

When you practice with an actual person (literally anyone will do), your entire approach changes. Your responses become more fluid, your personality shines through, and you appear significantly more relaxed and confident.

## The Simple Method That Changed Everything

1. Find ANY adult—friend, family member, former colleague, neighbor, barista at your local coffee shop
2. Ask for just 10-15 minutes of their time
3. Give them a list of 10-15 common interview questions
4. Have them ask these questions randomly
5. Respond exactly as you would in a real interview

The difference is immediate and dramatic. You practice maintaining eye contact, reading social cues, adjusting your tone based on reactions, and managing your facial expressions and body language—none of which happens when you're talking to your laptop camera.

I've noticed that whenever I go a few weeks without this kind of practice, my interview performance tanks. But a quick 15-minute session with my neighbor or cousin gets me back in fighting form.

This might seem stupidly simple, but if you're struggling with interviews despite having good qualifications, this could be the missing piece. Our brains are wired for human connection, not computer screens.

Anyone else try this approach? What other ""obvious but overlooked"" interview hacks have worked for you?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",10,1747362450.0,jobsearchhacks,1,0.92,False

I have been to the Napa region once before but none of the other girls have. We are staying in downtown Napa and have access to a rental car to get us between wineries. One of the girls on the trip is pregnant and will not be drinking and I understand some wineries still charge a fee for non-drinkers. Our preference of wines include Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Chenin Blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, and sparkling wine. For tastings, $75 is the upper limit of what we would like to spend per person.

Here is the general itinerary I've roughly built out so far. The asterisks are where I could use some guidance and suggestions.

Thursday (downtown Napa):

Friday (central Napa):

Saturday (Calistoga, St. Helena):

\- breakfast/coffee @ Bouchon Bakery, wine tastings @ Sterling and \*\*\* (1-2 more tastings), lunch @ \*\*\*, explore shops along Main St. St Helena, dinner @ Farmstead

I work and live what would be considered a textbook ""middle class lifestyle."" I'm a High School educator and football coach, live in a brick ranch in the suburbs, enjoy mowing my lawn, etc. I am a former college athlete and I did let myself go after that until around 2019 when I was 250 lbs. Since 2019 I got back on a very healthy diet and exercise regimen and I've stayed around 165-170 lbs for the past 4 years. I'm at a 9% body fat currently. In 2021 I ditched all soda from my life (I used to be an ardent Mtn Dew drinker but drifted to Coke Zero because of ""NO CALORIES""). Still, even though I was active, ate well, and had basically perfect labs, I still struggled with what I felt was my energy and an often times foggy mind.

In June 2024 I decided to discontinue taking my SSRI (Lexapro 10mg) that I had been on for 8 years. I had a Hyponatremia emergency in 2016 that really messed with my fight or flight response and the best solution the doctors came up with at the time was it was treatable through an antidepressant because the symptoms presented themselves as General Anxiety. I wanted to see if this was what was lowering my energy and I knew it was devastatingly cratering my libido. I did not taper as long as I should have; I have a very ""do it all now or don't do it at all"" mentality. I was off Lexapro completely by the 4th of July in 2024. That was not an enjoyable experience but honestly I'd say by August I was feeling good. In-fact I remember stating that I didn't notice a  negative difference (and saw positives!). By the end of fall I was noticing my stress levels were increasing yet I still had my Zyn that I would have in my mouth all the time. Even at work when I was on prep or my lunch I would have one in. When my infant was screaming at 3am I'd gladly get up with him because I'd just throw a pouch in and start my day. Still, my energy levels and all that seemed off. Had another round of blood work done at my annual physical and everything was ""as normal as one could hope for"" at my age.

In November I took an inventory of things I wanted to change to really get to a fully healthy lifestyle (and see if it'll get myself back to what I think is tip top shape). The biggest things I noticed were that 1. I do not sleep a lot due to having a baby in some form for the past 5 years keeping us awake. 2. I was using a THC pen every night to help sleep. I never had an issue falling asleep but the pen would just knock me out in 3 or less minutes and I thought that was better than tossing and turning or doom scrolling. 3. I was still consuming a lot of artificial sweetness in the form of the gum and mints I consume and the stuff that was in Zyn. 3. The biggest of them all: QUITTING ZYN.

Come November 15th 2024 I quit Zyn cold-turkey. I tried some replacement therapy stuff with TeaZa, Smokey Mountain, and Jake's Mint Chew and none of them really did much. I tried an Ashwaganda and Rhodiola supplementation but that did not seem to help either my anxiety or withdrawls despite the fact that I put myself through it for a month on and a month off and repeated that 2x! I quit THC. I now only use Xylitol gum and Simply Mints. Sleeping still isn't great. Quitting Zyn was awful, yet, I noticed come March I still hadn't had a single pouch.

Now here I am 6 months later. According to the Quitty! app I have avoided 2800 pouches and saved close to $1000. However, I can't help notice lately I really just want to go back to it. I quit Grizzly back in 2016 for exactly 6 months as well (while I was going through the Hyponatremia fallout), but relapsed around this time. I think my biggest struggle has been that despite the massive amount of changes I have made in the past year, the only things I've really noticed changing are that:

My health really is unchanged (haven't gained any weight thankfully) but my resting heart rate was around 55-60 prior and it still is there now. My blood pressure was around 110-115/75-80. I find myself getting way more irritated at simple things and overall less happy. I was told back in 2021 that I really needed to cut specific things out of my life in order to truly be healthy and I quote ""You will not believe how great you feel when you eliminate artificial sweeteners, tobacco, THC."" I think back and I am jealous of how good I had it back then. I had so many instant dopamine options at my disposal (and I had an SSRI on top of that).

In addition to working at a school I am also a clinically licensed mental health professional so I'm so aware of how a lot of this works or how we in the community understand brain health. I know that based on all that I've eliminated it can take 18-24 months to ""really"" see the changes. However I just think I really want the instant calming effect that Zyn had. I know I'm romanticizing it because it wasn't as good as I remember, but damn was it and other things a crutch.

I still find myself very happy when I'm with my kids, coaching, and other things. I still do interval trianing 4-5 days a week and lift 2-3 days a week as well. The one thing I noticed most is I cannot sit still now or I begin to either want to doze off and fall asleep or my mind is racing. So I am always constantly moving and when my mind is occupied I'm doing well. Like I've felt fine while typing all of this. But, if I was not super engaged like I was here I would be thinking about why things don't feel ""right.""

For just a little more context here is my normal week:

Here is my overall day with diet and everything else so you have a full picture per se.

Monday-Friday:

I wake up around 5:45 AM. This can be changed if one of my kids wake up but I am usually up around this time. I get dressed for work. I take one Thorne Stress B Complex capsule and 1 tbsp of Organic Apple Cider vinegar. I usually am listening to a podcast but not on headphones. I have my breakfast which I prepare the night before. The breakfast is a smoothie made up of: 8 oz of unsweet vanilla almond milk. 1/2 cup of Oikos Triple Zero Vanilla yogurt. 4 TBSP of Naked Double Chocolate Protein Powder 4 TBSP of Simple Truth Organic Peanut Butter powder 1/2 of a frozen banana blended with ice. I drink that and then pack up and drive to work with my lunch, gym bag, and coffee. My commute to work is less than 5 minutes. 

I work as a school social worker at suburban high school. It allows for a lot of interaction with students and staff but also a ton of time on a computer due to paperwork. I usually drink my 20 oz tumbler of coffee between 7:45 and 9:00 am. My coffee is brewed at home in a standard 12 cup coffee maker. I use 1/2 cup of medium roast coffee grounds to make the 12 cup pot. During the work day around 11-11:15 I will go to the school cafeteria and eat two bags of the small packs of sliced apples and a bag of baby carrots. Around 12:30 or as late as 1:00 I eat my lunch. My lunch everyday is 1 romaine lettuce hairt, 1 ounce of baby spring mix, 2 hounces of rainbow shredded carrots, 2 ounces of matchstix radish, 1/3 of a chopped cucumber, 1.5 oz of chopped whole mushrooms. 1/2 cup of spinach and arugula mix. 3 oz of chicken breast and 3-4 tbsp of simple truth organic creamy parmasan dressing. At the end of the school day I spend most of the school year coaching. I coach JV football which is the biggest time commitment in the fall. Middle school basketball in the winter and middle school track and field in the spring. The latter being the ""ligthest"" of the coaching responsibilities. 

During the football season I exercise usually exclusively at night tiem after the kids go to bed. In the spring I will sometimes work out after practice or fit it in maybe in a lunch hour. My workouts consist of lifting (Shaun T Dig Deeper program modified is what I currently am using) 3-4x a week and then Insanity Max30 cardio is done around 6x a week. A full workout session of lifting and cardio lasts around 65 minutes with 430-500 calories burned. A just max30 cardio session usually is 35-38 minutes with around 300-330 calories burned. I try and drink ultima replenisher after for electroylite replenishment and just recently have tried to have transparent labs 100% whey one scoop to help with muscle growth and recovery. Frankly I haven't done grat at having the protein but I'm working on it.

When I get home from work it's usually pretty chaotic. Between making dinner cleaning up from dinner, laundry, playing with the kids, kids showers and bed time, prepping breakfast and clothes for the next day. That whole process usually ends around 8:30-9:00. Sometimes I work out after that or I did so earlier in the day. I'm usually in bed around 10:30-11:15. I do have a bowl of simple truth organic honey nut cheerois and I do know that is something that isn't the greatest (do not have any milk with it just dry cereal). I usually fall asleep within 2 minutes of trying to fall asleep but I do have a bad habit of being on my phone in the bed for like 10 minutes. For years I used a THC cart pen before bed that would knock me out to sleep very quickly. Recently I have quit doing that on the regular to try and see if that was impacting my energy and overall mood. Jury is out on if that makes a difference and occasionally I will take a few puffs still of it before bed. My sleep can be okay or pretty broken depending on how often I'm awoken by our children. My wife and I are stressed a lot and it can be very hectic in our home. Thankfully we are in a good financial situation and that has eased some stress.

The weekends aren't always following a routine but we do go to mass each week. Usually at 10:30 sunday and we have family breakfast before that. The rest of it is busy a lot with grocery shopping, activities, and all. Like I said I do like to have a couple light beers on fridays and saturdays but only after the kids are in bed and tasks are complete. I am very task driven and can do mostly anything around the house even with little sleep. I find that when I go go go I don't think about stuff too often. It's when I'm not actively active that I really notice the stuff with my body (for example when I'm at my desk at work, driving, etc.) or when I'm super stimulated and stressed.  I can be exhausted yet still able to do a full one hour 500 calorie burning workout. 

I forgot to mention for dinner we usually have some sort of chicken or beef meal with a vegetable and starch. We do not drink any soda and all I consume is water and coffee. I forgot to mention that I will have sometimes an additional 2 or so small cups of coffee throughout the day depending on how I feel my energy level is.

I just want to be sharp, have more energy and clearer sights both physically and mentally.

Was craving vanilla pastry, went to a well established bakery to eat and it tasted literally like sugar. Same thing with every rosemilk, milkshake, cold coffee, juice, pastry, cake, ice cream that I have had recently. Has the collective taste palette gone extreme towards sweet that everything tastes like sugar syrup?

Farmers market in mosaic or downtown alexandria sounds good, but what else? Is there a good place just to get tea/coffee/ice cream and walk around with good scenery or somewhere to just check out random shops? No bars/alcohol/brewery as I don't drink.

1knpvim,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1knpvim/my_bridezilla_cousin_expect_us_to_pay_for_almost/,My bridezilla cousin expect us to pay for almost her whole wedding.,"When I told my friend this crazy story of my bridezilla cousin, she told me to ""make a reddit account, post it into Charlotte community. She loves that kind of tea"" so here I am

Buckle up it's looooonggg!! Hi! You can call me Zab (25F) my cousin Shai also (25F) is getting married, I've got an Invitation so is my whole family, (Mom, Dad, 2sis 21 and 19) I'm actually expecting that I'm just gonna sit beside my mom but I'm wrong, I'm one of the BMs! I am BEYOND surprised, I'm SHOCKED! First we're not close enough and second we barely talk, u asking why? Because she's kinda mean growing up, I beg my mom not to send me in the same high school she's in. Fast forward after 2 weeks, she made a group chat with the other BMs and MOH all of the BMs is unfamiliar, maybe her friends in college or anyone, the only familiar in there is my cousin Charlie (24F) she's her MOH. That's also surprising. Charlie is sweet, kind, people pleaser, successful and a relatives favorite (she's also my favorite) also never talked to her, MOH is supposed to be the closest to the bride but Charlie and Shai never even spoke before. Back to the group chat she messaged us that she's not gonna pay for our dress because there's already a lot of expenses they need to pay, we all agreed. The dress cost us 2k each, nevertheless it's beautiful no one complaints, for the fitting we need to meet at a coffee shop near her house because it's convenient for her still we all agreed, even though it's Tuesday at 10am (Work day and time) some of the BMs need to take a day off for work, it's fine for them, then she told us about the bachelorette trip in Vegas, the itinerary is so good it's ALMOST that you can't say no, the only problem about that trip is it cost 15grand+ it's ridiculously high because the hotel that she wants cause 5grand a night. She said she's not gonna help paying it because it's already our gift to her for the bachelorette party, we didn't need to give anything else. No one replies. 15k is a ridiculous amount even if all of the 9 girls pinch in. One of the BMs ""Chloe"" says the price is to expensive, she didn't know if she can afford it that's when Shai let out one of her true colors, she started cursing and embarrassing Chloe in the group chat and started calling her a poor dirty bi'ch. I'm not surprised abt that, she's a spoiled brat who gets whatever she wants so when she doesn't, she wouldn't control herself and threw a fit like a child. I told her to stop and I'm just gonna pay for it, but they just need to pay for their own expense for the trip. They all dm's me to say thank you but Shai kicked Chloe out of the group chat, remember Chloe she's gonna be important for later. Anyway 2 days before the bachelorette trip Charlie called me, saying she's been meaning to ask something. I got suspicious. We talked about a lot of things in the phone then she asked ""How many guests do you think Shai has?"" Her mom told my mom there's gonna be above 300 or 400 idk so i did tell her that. Fast forward to the bachelorette trip, I all meet the bridesmaids in the airport, Shai's not with us she's in business class. Me and the other BMs and Charlie talked while boarding and we had a great time not until one of them tells us that they're not really close to Shai so they're worrying that it's gonna be awkward, now there's no need for them to worry because even though they're not really close to Shai they have us. Charlie and I looked at each other, because we know that even us is not close to her. WTAF??? WTH is happening, BMs and MOH isn't her circles?? How about her friends?? Some of the BMs told us that Shai's their BOSS at WORK that's why she's so mad at Chloe because she knows how much is she making. THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED THAT CHARLIE AND I IS ONE OF HER MOST SUCCESSFUL COUSIN. WTH?! I didn't say anything but that just didn't made sense at all. 

(I earns 400-500k annually I'm a CTO and Charlie earns 600-700k I'm not sure) just to give context 

TO THE BACHELORETTE PARTY 

We're all having fun Shai's being an angel and sweet. I still bring a gift so is all of the rest. She's so happy with all our gift and says she's really lucky to have us as her bridal party, maybe she wasn't bad at all i thought. When everyone was having fun Shai called us because she wanted to thank us properly.

""First everyone thank you for all of you and how wonderful you were to me, this wedding is messing with my mental health but because of you guys everything is going easy thank you. Thank you also Zab for paying the hotel you were so nice loveyou. Also a special thank you for Charlie for accepting my request to pay for the catering"" she said something like this but even more longer

WT? I looked at Charlie but she still looks awkward when we all turn our heads to her. After that Shai and some of the girls went back to partying but as a curious cat I ask Charlie about the catering and if she needs some help. Then she started telling me about the conversationt that she has with Shai, she said at first Shai only ask her to pay HALF it's fine for her because she's still her cousin and she loves doing favors for family. I asked her how much is the cater then I learned that it's from a 4 star restaurant ( you probably hear this restaurant in some of the famous influencer and famous celebrities like the Kardashians) It Cost 31k but 2 days before the trip Shai called her to say it's already been paid for because the restaurant needs advance payment, so she ask Charlie to just reimburse her, but because she already paid it, she ask Charlie to cover the whole 31k even though hesitating Charlie said yes. I felt bad for her. It's not her wedding but she's already spending so much money. Fast forward we got home and everyone enjoyed the Vegas trip

After not so long we were informed that Charlie is not the MOH anymore. It's Chloe now, yes Chloe. I immediately called Charlie and she said that Shai already ask her about it and she said ""I think it's a good idea"" because it's an easier job to be a BM. So she's fine with it I'm fine with it. The gals told me that Chloe got a promotion and suddenly they become besties, still no words. Charlie's still paying for the catering and nothing change except the positions. After a few hours, Shai called me I answered 

""Hi Zab are you busy"" 

""No, what's up?"" 

""Can I ask you a favor? Please say yes"" 

""Uhm I guess, what is it?"" 

""I have a dream wedding cake and my budget's really tight because y'know everything is expensive, can you pay for it? Not that you have to"" she laugh. Her exact words 

""Uhm yeah sure, do you need anything else? "" 

"" OHMYGODD 'scream' thank you so much, also haha can you cover the gown? I mean if it's not too much?""

"" Oh yeah uhm how much is it?""

"" Oh only 27k, but it's already paid you can just venmo me so you know""

"" Yeah...sure? but can I do that after the wedding? If that's alright ""

"" Oh absolutely, thank you Zab you're the best""

My phone is in auto recording in incoming calls so yep I've got that on record.

Fast forward a week before the wedding she told everyone that were gonna have a spa day ""her treat"" for the upcoming event. We all agreed. Fast forward to the spa. When we arrive everyone is there, we all hug and so on. Shai suddenly has an announcement before we proceed, she said she didn't want to ruin her mood in her wedding day so she didn't want to be disappointed with our gifts so she'll just say what she wants so there'll be no problem, She prepare the pictures of the gifts with their price on it. All of the gift she show them is expensive, it's all branded bag, shoes, customize dress, paid vecation etc. Then she goes to Charlie ""and for your gift Cha I want this necklace, see? It's beautiful"" Charlie's stunned i didn't see the necklace but base on Charlie's reaction it costs a lot, then she goes to me ""And for you Zab, here"" she showed me the photo, it's also a necklace that costs 100k+ WTFF?? That's when I've had enough of this BS I told her 

""I'm sorry I can't afford that, with the wedding gown and the cake, and also I already spent ten thousands of dollars in our vegas trip, I don't think I can add anything on my cart""

She frown like i said something ridiculous, and I saw the anger coming in her eyes, when she's about to speak Charlie cut her off saying 

"" Yeah actually me either, I couldn't spent 250k on a necklace, I mean it's not even my wedding but I already spending so much, 250k isn't a wedding gift anymore, it's just a luxury you didn't wanna pay for""

My jaw dropped! That's not very Charlie, she used to say yes to everything that Shai says to us even though it's too much, that's when Shai starts to make a scene. Screaming shouting and saying we were useless cousin and we were such a bi'ch for ganging up against her just because were helping her. I actually didn't mean for her to feel that way I just had enough. And for Charlie, I don't really know what's gotten into her, she's mad, I've never seen her that mad before. 

Shai's still raging like a beast, shouting and cursing at us. Everyone is looking at her because her voice is really really really loud. When the security arrives they escort her out and told us to leave the property, but before she the guard pulled her she shouts ""You know what F'CK THE BOTH OF YOU, You're no longer INVITED! the both of you!! F'CK YOU"" And yes, were uninvited. Charlie cried when we arrive at my car, she started saying sorry to me because she just had enough of it, and she's sorry for being mad but Shai's just too much. I know were wrong for addressing that in front of the gals but I just explode, she's taking advantage of everything just because she's getting married. The parents heard about what happened in the spa and Charlie's mom is furious apparently she's paying for the venue lol, it's so funny how Shai's still wanting Charlie's mom to pay for her venue but we all didn't go, so is my family and Charlie family 

Oh yeah lol I almost forgot this, Shai called us after the wedding asking for the money for catering, venue and gown lol. We told were not giving her any money because we weren't even in the wedding, and it's her wedding after all pay for it herself. Apparently she thought even after uninviting us we'll still pay for her wedding, were just not going and not giving her gifts. 



Ps. I didn't use our real names. Only my Nickname ""Zab"" and Charlie's nickname ""Cha"" 

Thank u for reading

1knpv9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToBeHero_X/comments/1knpv9h/soda_theory_a_theory_on_how_x_got_his_powers/,Soda Theory: A theory on how X got his powers,"I made a post here before, but I found some more information and want to share my thoughts on what I call ""Soda Theory"". It's basically a theory on how X got his powers. 

Part 1: Why is the X soda so important?

Ever since the very first concept trailer of TBHX, the X soda has played a very significant role. Not only does X specifically get excited when seeing it, but when he throws it, the camera zooms right in on the logo. In almost every episode of the show, the soda appears in some capacity, showing that it definitely plays an important role in the show, but we just don't know how yet.

Part 2: How TBHX relates to the other seasons

We know TBHX is the third season in the To Be Hero franchise. Now, the director has said there are no direct connections between the previous two, and this one, but he did say the themes are the same. This could mean anything, but we do know for a fact TBHX at least references the previous seasons, as in the concept trailer, X stands on a sign that displays the logo of season 1. Now in season 2, To Be Heroine, the antagonist uses a soda that was capable of brainwashing the entire town into believing him. You can probably see where this is going.

Part 3: Foreshadowing similarities

In To Be Heroine, the soda being crucial to the plot was foreshadowed in many ways. One of the main ways was through subtle advertisement. Not only would characters drink the soda in almost every episode, but posters of the soda would always appear everywhere. Of course, we never know the soda was crucial until near the end, but it was foreshadowed from the very beginning. Very similar to the X soda.

Part 4: Where does X work?

We know X works is a business man in some sort of corporate office as seen in his character trailer. I think we can get some hints from this trailer as to his specific job though. He grabs a coffee mug with a logo on it. The logo was purple, pink, and blue. It doesn't seem very interesting until the end of his character trailer, where X is seen drinking a soda with the color scheme of purple, pink, and blue. It's very possible X works at a place that, at least in some way, helps advertise for sodas. Worth noting that this way of advertisement is almost identical to the way the soda from To Be Heroine was advertised.

Conclusion: How did X get his powers?

Just like the antagonist from To Be Heroine, X was able to brainwash people with the soda (most likely via advertisement) that a man with white hair and sunglasses was omnipotent and was Hero X. Since he was the one dressing up as this, all the people believing this would inadvertently give him power.

Possible Argument: Why was X advertising an X soda if he didn't have power yet? X wouldn't have existed yet

Response: As we can see from the character trailer for The Johnnie's, Hero X had been a concept in this world long before the current X. The previous X was The Johnnie's father, so it makes sense why people would advertise for X before the current one existed.  ",6,1747361888.0,ToBeHero_X,0,1.0,False
