1g4n553,https://www.reddit.com/r/30PlusSkinCare/comments/1g4n553/was_told_that_i_have_significant_volume_loss_in/,Was told that I have significant volume loss in cheeks compared to other 30 year olds at a medspa. What lifestyle factors could cause this? ,"Hi I recently turned 30 and have been really into skincare the past year or so. My skin doesn’t look bad, but my nasolabial folds have become more prominent in the past couple years. I’m not trying to look 20 forever, I just want to age as gracefully as possible. 

So today I went to a medspa for mainly cheek and lip filler, but I have the injector a budget and said that he could place the filler wherever he saw to be most fit. We were getting along well, and then he asked if I’m a runner bc I have lost a lot more volume in my cheeks than the rest of my peers. He even asked if he could get less filler in my lips so he could put more in my cheeks bc a subtle amount of filler in each cheek wouldn’t be enough. I don’t think he said this to upsell me bc he wanted to do this within the same budget.

I am almost never in the sun and when I do I use spf religiously. I have used prescription tret (.5) for a year now. I have my mom’s face and skin and I notice that she didn’t have the same issue at this age. I am thinking it is mostly caused by lifestyle factors and want to know what may specifically be causing this. Overall, I need to be healthier, but I’m wondering what most likely caused this, so I don’t change my whole life at once. 

Possible lifestyle factors causing premature volume loss: 

- prescribed adderall for 5 years now
- huge coffee and energy drinker
- never work out
- sleep on side
-have a really expressive face and smile a lot
- vitamin d deficiency 
- husband smokes around me and I smoked for two years in the past
- I’ve eaten mainly vegetarian while living in a country where that’s uncommon so it was hard for me to have perfect nutrition/ protein consumption throughout the years
- a couple years ago I dropped 30lbs from severely reducing my calories which caused me to lose weight really fast


Lifestyle factors working in my favor:
- I never sleep less than 8 hours
- lucky enough to live a pretty stress free life
- I’m at a healthy bmi 

Writing all this I see that I need to be healthier as a whole. But I want to see what are the most damaging of these bc my unhealthy lifestyle factors are things I enjoy and I don’t want to stop anything for only a minor difference. ",1,1729039623.0,30PlusSkinCare,1,1.0,False
1g4n50q,https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/16/garden/on-the-road-to-acclaim-a-chef-learns-lessons-in-humility.html,"On the Road to Acclaim, a Chef Learns Lessons in Humility - Note, this is an article about Thomas Keller published in 1996","> I read this article after seeing people discuss his appearance and how it fits into the theme of the show, so I figured some of you might be interested in reading it as well. 

THE people who work in Thomas Keller's kitchen here do not wear baseball caps backward -- or forward. There are no scraps of food on the floor. In fact, for a kitchen that is in the middle of preparing dinner, there is an eerie quiet.

''A lot of people do remark when they first come here about how quiet it is,'' said Stephen Durfee, the pastry chef at the French Laundry, a two-year-old restaurant in this Napa Valley town that some knowledgeable people consider one of the best in the country. ''It's the strictest kitchen I've ever worked in. You have to take care of your own equipment, wash and dry it. No one ever dried anything in any kitchen I've worked in.''

Having a reputation for high standards is preferable to a reputation for temper tantrums, and a few years ago it was Mr. Keller's temper that was often remarked on. Now, he says it is under control.

''I don't explode anymore,'' the 40-year-old chef said. ''I let it out different ways. You become more mature. You don't accept incompetence, and if someone is incompetent you find an expression for your anger. I get close to the stove. I sweat more.''
Some who know him see the change. ''I definitely saw a big difference in him when I went out to the French Laundry last summer,'' said Chris Gesualdi, the chef at Montrachet, who worked with Mr. Keller for several years in New York. ''When he was at Rakel and Raoul's and La Reserve, he was very intense and he screamed at people and told them they didn't know what they were doing. He's much more relaxed now and he compromises much more, but his food is incredible. There is no second best with this guy.''

Mr. Keller's pursuit of perfection continues unchecked, and the food world has taken notice. Sitting in the lovely garden of his romantic little 62-seat restaurant, Mr. Keller mused about his celebrity.

''Sometimes it bothers me we got four stars,'' he said, referring to reviews in both San Francisco newspapers. ''There are glimpses of perfection, but they come in short spurts. I'm not satisfied yet.''

But those who sit in the magical garden outside the 100-year-old fieldstone house or in the cozy dining room that once housed a French steam laundry are more forgiving. Words like ''sublime,'' ''impeccable,'' ''intelligent'' and ''dazzling'' float through the night air. People who come here are treated to brilliantly layered flavors that are perfectly balanced.

''This is a serious restaurant, but I don't want customers to feel that this is a temple of gastronomy,'' Mr. Keller said. ''There is a certain amount of intellect behind the food that is both whimsical and serious. People should come here and have a good time, so I want people to understand the food by drawing a reference point to something else they've had. It's a way to surprise people, to make them smile and relax.''
Like ''toad in the hole'' -- not the cooked egg in a circle of white bread that one remembers from childhood, but a quail egg in brioche with eggs from a sturgeon. Or ''coffee and doughnuts,'' the signature dessert, which is a tiny freshly made doughnut with cappuccino semifreddo.

Mr. Keller describes his cooking as progressive American cuisine with traditional French influences.

''I try to create food that makes sense logically, and that logic comes from traditional French cuisine, not from French-Japanese or Japanese-California,'' he said. ''There is some Italian.''

And there is some Asian, like the tartare of tuna, in which tuna is treated like a piece of beef. Mango provides the color that would traditionally be provided by raw egg, and cucumber gives the crunch that onions give in beef tartare.

The chef learned to cook as a child, helping to peel vegetables at the restaurants in Florida where his mother was a dining-room manager. He studied psychology in college but became a full-time chef when his mother was desperate for a replacement for a chef who had quit without notice. He learned how to cook prime rib of beef over the phone, consulting with his older brother, Joseph, who was already a chef.
On a trip to Newport, R.I., in 1976 to watch the tall ships he got a job as a fish cook even though he knew nothing about cooking fish. ''It was just something I knew I could accomplish, and that was the crack through the door where I could see what cooking was all about,'' he said.

Along the way he learned to make sole meuniere, coquille St.-Jacques and cream sauce. ''I learned by asking stupid questions,'' he said.

Never doubting his own ability, by 1977 Mr. Keller felt he was ready to open a restaurant and returned to Florida, where he joined two men who had never worked in a restaurant before. ''We ran the restaurant for one and a half years till we ultimately failed,'' he said. ''It was my first taste of responsibility, managing people and being critiqued and learning the why of cooking.''

But self-knowledge was on the way. His next stop was a restaurant where the chef, upset with Mr. Keller because he couldn't truss a chicken, threw a knife at him. ''It may not be the best way,'' he said, ''but it taught me how to tie a chicken.''

He spent three summers at a restaurant in the Catskills, where he served 80 people a night with no help other than a dishwasher. ''I learned great organizational skills because I had to do it all myself,'' he said.
He felt he was ready for the big time. But his job as an assistant at the Grand Hyatt in New York lasted 10 days. ''I was miserable,'' he said.

Eventually he became the chef at Raoul's, the French bistro in SoHo. After that, he took a day job with Christian Delouvrier, who was opening Maurice, the restaurant at the Parker Meridien hotel, and a night job with Patrice Boeley, who was the chef at the Polo in the Westbury.

During this period, he learned that stealing another chef's ideas is frowned upon. ''I'd learn something at the Maurice, and I'd reinterpret it at Polo,'' he said. ''The food and beverage director of the Maurice came to dinner at Polo and saw it and it was a scandal. Christian told me it was not done. It was very embarrassing.''

Cooking in France had always been on his mind, and he finally arranged it, at eight restaurants, including Taillevent, Guy Savoy and Pre Catalan. Mr. Keller was reaching the top, but still had a lot to learn about cooking skills and humility.

''There was a 14-year-old telling me I didn't know how to peel a turnip,'' he recalled. ''I learned modesty. I was 26 years old and realized I was seeing the big picture.''
After a year and a half, he went back to New York and became the chef at La Reserve. But he thought he knew more than the owner.

''I was arrogant,'' he admitted. ''I had a clear vision of what I wanted to do -- more contemporary -- and it didn't coincide with the way the owner wanted to do things, which was traditional.

''One day, we had an argument in the kitchen and I told him to get out. Ultimately, you can't throw the owner out of his kitchen. I was fired.''

In 1985, his former boss Serge Raoul asked him to become the chef and his partner at Rakel, a new restaurant in Manhattan. It was there that Mr. Keller came to public attention, but by 1990 he was gone.

''I learned it didn't matter how good a cook you are,'' he said. ''It was about organization, management. The management was not as strong as it should have been. The restaurant was undercapitalized, and we didn't capitalize on great reviews. Financially it wasn't working, and Serge Raoul wanted to run Rakel like Raoul's, like a bistro. I didn't want to compromise what I was cooking and realized I would have to make a change.
''It was heartbreaking, confusing. It was torture. I was sad, depressed, embarrassed. Now I feel it was a great accomplishment to gain that experience at that age.''

He retreated to Los Angeles, where he worked for a year at a hotel restaurant. He then began making olive oil commercially and disappeared from the restaurant scene for 18 months.

He had first seen the French Laundry in 1987, when it was owned by Don and Sally Schmidt. ''It was a magical place,'' he said. ''It reminded me of France.''

By 1994 the Schmidts were ready to sell, so Mr. Keller and 50 limited partners bought it for $1.2 million. Listening to Mr. Keller, it sounds as if the place will never meet his standards.

''We don't have the right entrance,'' he said. ''The patio is horrible, it kicks up dust. It gets on people's shoes, it gets on the tablecloth; it tracks in the restaurant. We had only $10,000 to spend on the patio and it all went to chairs. It would take seven tons of Connecticut bluestone for the patio and that costs $27,000.''
Couldn't he settle for something local? ''This is the French Laundry, and you have to have certain things,'' he said.

Unlike so many chefs, Mr. Keller has no interest in a restaurant empire. ''If this is Thomas Keller's cuisine, how can you have it in two places?'' he said.",1,1729039612.0,TheBear,0,1.0,False

Very rough query: 

Inspired by Celtic mythology and the Atlantic cod fishery collapse, OF THE SALT DEEP is a 90K standalone LGBTQ+ YA Urban Fantasy. 

Seventeen-year-old self-described loser Lorcan is not having a good time. As if failing his senior year and getting rejected by the girl he’s had a crush on for years wasn’t enough, Lorcan and his insufferably perfect sister are forced to spend their summer vacation with their estranged aunt and grandfather on an overfished, financially ruined island off the coast of Newfoundland.

It’s on the island that Lorcan meets Sam, the charismatic nephew of the island's only working fisherman, Halloran. With his startling green eyes, webbed fingers, and ability to make Lorcan feel noticed for the first time in his life, Sam is unlike anyone Lorcan has ever met. When Lorcan witnesses the horrific abuse Sam suffers at the hands of Halloran and the islanders, Sam confesses to Lorcan that he's a Selkie – notoriously alluring seal fae who must do the bidding of whoever steals their seal coat. Captured by Halloran years ago and desperate to return to the sea ever since, Sam has been forced to lure fish into the trawler's nets, with brutal consequences if he doesn’t. 

At the risk of inciting the wrath of Halloran and the islanders who rely on the fish to keep the island alive, Lorcan agrees to help Sam find his coat before the fish inevitably run out and Sam is killed. But as the summer wears on and Sam and Lorcan grow closer in their search for Sam’s coat, Lorcan's fascination with Sam begins to turn into obsession, an obsession that leads Lorcan to wonder if he'll be able to let Sam go when – and if – they find his coat.

First 300ish words: 

*God, I don’t want to be here.*
      
I mean, I really, *really* don’t want to be here. 
          
Tourists in rain slickers swarm the ferry’s brine-spattered deck. They jostle against the railing, their *ooh*s and *ahh*s punctured by the clicking of cameras, the razor-throated shriek of seabirds. 

Apparently, coughing up eighty bucks to gawp at a floating chunk of ice the size of a mini-mall is a thing. Who knew? 

And then there’s this shrill, orgasmic cry of, *""Oh my God! A seal!""*, and all these tourists, these happy, wholesome families with their fanny packs and their little ziplock baggies full of ten-dollar-a-pound organic trail mix go rushing over, desperate to catch a glimpse of something they'd only ever seen on TV. A petite blonde woman clutching a glittery pink Starbucks thermos in one hand and this year's iPhone in the other shoves me, linebacker style, into the metal staircase leading to the upper deck. Her kids, a boy and a girl with iPhones of their own, plus a selfie stick each, chase after her. 

I don't get it, any of it, and I'm not about to try to, either. 

The only person who I can confidently say is about as unimpressed as I am is my sister, Neeghan. She stands by the lifeboats, looking more than a little out of place in her tiny shorts, bright pink flip flops, and too-thin *Sacred Heart Dance Team* jacket. Her curly hair, straightened within an inch of its life, is twisted into this giant bun thing that bobs back and forth with each shuddering heave of the ferry. Thirteen years of ballet have made her feet permanently splayed, her balance impeccable. She’s nursing her second cup of burned coffee and glaring at her phone. The whole time her greasy, gloss-smeared lips are moving, muttering, swearing. 

No cell service out here. 

This isn't really so much of a problem for me as it is for Neeghan, but that's mostly because she's got something I don't - a life. And friends. *Plural.*

But if you’re like me, that constant demand for interaction can leave you feeling drained and overwhelmed. It took me a while to understand my own needs and give myself permission to step back, but I’ve found a few ways to recharge and create balance, even when things get hectic. I thought I’d share them here in case they resonate with anyone else!

1. Set Boundaries That Honor Your Energy

I used to feel guilty for turning down invites or needing time alone after social events. But I’ve realized that saying “no” is a way of respecting my own limits. Whether it’s carving out quiet time in the morning or scheduling solo weekends, setting these boundaries helps me feel more present when I do engage with others.


2. Embrace Meaningful One-on-One Connections

Large gatherings can be draining, so I focus on spending time with a few close friends or family members who truly get me. I’ve found that deep, meaningful conversations with people I trust are much more fulfilling than trying to keep up with everyone. Don’t be afraid to suggest coffee dates or smaller get-togethers they’re often more enjoyable and give you a chance to connect on a deeper level.


3. Make Space for Activities That Recharge You

Introverts tend to recharge through quiet, solitary activities. For me, reading, journaling, and taking long walks are essential. I set aside time each week for these things, even if it means blocking out time on my calendar. Finding little pockets of time to do something calming can make a huge difference in keeping stress levels down.


4. Practice Self-Compassion When You Need a Break

It’s easy to feel like we “should” be more social or “should” want to go out more. But I’ve learned that it’s okay to need a break. When you start feeling overwhelmed or overstimulated, remind yourself that there’s nothing wrong with needing time alone. It doesn’t mean you’re missing out it means you’re listening to what you need to feel your best.


5. Find Ways to Thrive in Social Situations on Your Own Terms

Sometimes, socializing is unavoidable. I’ve found that grounding myself with simple tools like finding a quiet corner, focusing on one person at a time, or taking breaks when I need them helps me feel more comfortable. Going in with a plan makes it easier to handle social settings without feeling completely drained.


I know that being an introvert can feel challenging in a world that’s always moving, always asking for more, but it’s okay to pace yourself and make space for what you need. Do you have any go-to strategies that help you recharge or find balance as an introvert? I’d love to hear what works for you!

It's been so hard just getting through each day lately. My cat of 13 years passed away in August and the grief has been terrible, I've never resented working a shitty customer service job as much as I do lately, I'm just so fucking burnt out. I took a week off work but it wasn't enough. 

Now that PMS is hitting I just don't know how to cope anymore. I hate my shitty fucking life, I hate driving in this shit hole city, I just want my cat back and to make a living wage doing something other than making coffee and cleaning filthy bathrooms.

I’m a 2nd Yr CS & Physics Student in Australia. I’m looking for some work experience over the summer I’ve gone through the database of my states startups and messaged founder / hiring positions related people through LinkedIn. I’ve just started and have a meeting lined up next week with a founder for a startup that are developing a travel assistance software. I’ve offered my time as an unpaid intern over the summer but I really don’t know what that looks like. For context im also doing a summer unit which I can do mostly remote with the exception of going in for a class test twice in the summer. I also tutor in the evenings between 6-9pm 3 days a week. Im unsure on how to approach the meeting.

How many days of my time should I offer? 

Would it be appropriate of me to offer 12 weeks of my time and be available 3/4 days a week 9-5 with potentially a work from home day? As it is quite a small startup.  

What should I mention that I can do for them?

I’ve searched the entire internet for as much info as I can about the company but there isn’t much. Hence leading to my next question

 
What work is an intern generally given in the tech field?

I assume it’s not just getting coffees lol. But is this just being an assistant or doing admin tasks or listening in to meetings or just shadowing people?

Weekends where I didn't have a need for it or calmer days I wouldn't take any. Say on average I took 2-3 times a week.

Recently I express to my doctor that I wasn't happy of the instant release and crash and it made me not use it daily.

We agreed that I should try Concerta. I got my prescribtion and I saw that it was 54mg.

He made sure to mention that I shouldn't take it after 12pm and that coffee might cause some trouble.

I've been taking it everyday for 4 days. Not many issues, definetely prefer it over Ritalin just cause its much smoother but its also too early to be sure.

I came to this subreddit and saw a lot of people mentioning something called titration. My doctor didn't mention anything of that sorts and now I'm curious to know if this is unusual or not.

Is it a necessity to have a titration period of increasing the dose slowly or can I go from 0-100 without issues?",2,1729038738.0,ADHDUK,1,1.0,False

First, I was an au pair and worked for a single mom, taking care of her cute kid. I was good at it (kids love me), it was only part time and enjoyed it. But I masked heavily in the interview, portraying myself as extroverted and bubbly, only for the mom to realize eventually it was a mask and fire me, which meant I had to move out. She claimed her friend needed a job so asked her if she can be her au pair, but I suspect she just wanted to get rid of me.

Then, I moved into a place that was unfurnished, so because I choose the furniture it really felt like home. I loved it there. I'm gonna be honest, my then boyfriend was helping me financially so I got to just work for myself, a few hours a week teaching coding online. It was bliss not having to deal with bosses and co-workers... But then I broke up with my bf and had to move.

I moved in with a friend, which was great at first. My friend was teaching me how to drive, he would make me coffee in the morning, we would go on trips together which was perfect because we would do our on thing on the trip if we wanted to, so I wasn't overwhelmed. It then came to light that this friend likes me romantically. This basically triggered a mental breakdown and I ended up escaping to a house of the man I was dating and moving in with him for a few months, but that was a disaster that can be a whole post in itself lol.

Eventually, I find a place with a live in landlord and his dog. At this point I really needed a proper job, I find a teaching assistant job in a school and start working. At the same time, I am volunteering for a charity, which makes me feel really fulfilled, became friendly with my landlord (he is ND and helped me realize I am too), his dog loves me and keeps coming into my room to cuddle, the place feels cozy and like a home, I have trips booked with friends. I feel settled and like a functional human being. And then...

He tells me I need to move out because he is moving his friends in. At this point I have a full on mental breakdown, I am unable to go to work, which gets me fired, I cry every single day, I ghost the charity I volunteer for, the manager who is the sweetest person ever is still texting me asking if I'm okay, I feel like I let her down, on top of that I go on a trip with two friends and I find it EXHAUSTING. I moved to a house share where I have problems with one of the housemates but honestly I don't even care, I am just existing. I am just going through the day, I have given up believing my life will ever be settled, everything good in my life eventually gets taken away from me, it's like a curse.

1g4mqol,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1g4mqol/hr_darkstar/,[HR] Darkstar,"Why did they venture out to the void so far? Some came looking for glory, a story, or to sate their curiosities. What they found was the Darkstar.

The starjet hummed quietly as they were all awoken. Six of them made up the crew - Ronaldo, Marilyn, Phoebe, Omeka, Ivan, and Clark.

The sextet had scarcely seen each other, forget getting to know each other, since their journey began years ago, seeing as they all had been asleep and in hyperspace. Now, their speed has crawled to a measly 4% speed of light.

Clark and Phoebe were the first to make it to the common area. The ship resembled an isosceles trapezoid when viewed from above or below. The longer portion being the back, this is where most of the engine work was held as well as personal quarters and sleeping chambers. Toward the front, the shorter end, was where the common area was held. It was split between a mess hall/kitchen, a lounge area, and a gym. Beyond that, the cockpit. 

The lights above were harsh and the environment incredibly sterile. Clark thought this as he rubbed his eyes in response to the light. He felt a pit in his stomach, pure anxiety coursing through him as his mind continues to come to and realize their situation. *A grain of sand thrown into the ocean,* he remembered someone saying to him. He looked out the portholes into the black, never-ending void. He turned around to see Phoebe and his worries melted away. *I am not alone, at least,* he thought.

“Hello!” Clark said with great excitement. Phoebe still seemed dazed, but gave a meek smile. “I’m Clark, the documentarion,” he continued, holding out his hand.

Phoebe shook it, finding her resolve as he did. “Hello Clark, I’m Phoebe, the, uh, philosopher, I suppose.”

“Suppose? Well are ya or aren’t ya?” Clark asked. He was a small, slight man with a plain face, though Phoebe was drawn to his smile, confidence, and warmth.

“I am a philosopher, yes.”

""Ah, Phoebe the philosopher. What a cool gig; suppose philosophering is something you’re just born with, right? Not something you can go to school for? Either got it or you don’t. They taught me how to point a camera and frame a story, but hell, ask me about something that I can’t see or hold and I’m more lost than a bat in the dark.”

“I believe you can learn it. There are many books and teachings on a wide array of philosophy topics and philosophers who came before us to study on. Coming up with your own thoughts, now that is more difficult to teach. Also, bats do just well in the dark, Clark.”

“Would ya say philosophy is more about the question or the answer, Phoebe?” Clark asked with such sincerity that Phoebe felt the need to sit down, like she’d just run into an old friend in the midst of a bustling city and wanted to catch up for hours.

“I, uh, can we sit?” she asked. Clark nodded and followed her to the great stainless steel round table that sat in the middle of the mess hall. 

Someone else entered at that time. A large man with olive skin and curly hair, he too rubbed his eyes as he adjusted. He paid little mind to Phoebe and Clark but headed straight to the kitchen. “Fuck. Anyone want coffee?” he asked, his back turned to the pair. They both said ‘yes’ in unison.

Fifteen minutes later and the entire group had arrived. Omeka was the man who made the coffee, and he introduced himself as the pilot. Ivan and Marilyn named themselves religious scholars, and Ronaldo was the resident astrophysicist. 

“So, now that everyone is here, could we get to know each other?” Clark asked, his eyebrows raised as he lifted his steaming mug to his lips.

“Get to know each other?” Ivan asked.

“Seems unnecessary, we’ve a job to do, no?” Ronaldo said, turning his body toward to porthole to view the nothingness blast past them. There wasn’t much to see, 4% of the speed of light they moved, yet they still not had broken the Oort Cloud of this mysterious solar system. Ronaldo was a tall, lanky man with what they all would find was a perpetual five o’clock shadow that reached nearly all the way up to his dark eyes, and a nose and chin so sharp it appeared to be able to cut through steel.

“Aye, we’ve a job to do, Ronaldo, but I’m one who likes to know who I am chasing oblivion with. What say the rest of you? Of course, if it is too much to ask, I’ll let sleeping dogs lie. But I look at all of you, all interesting in your own right, and I see my family for who knows how long?”

“He’s got a point,” the religious pair said in unison.

“Into oblivion, who knows why we’re even here? Who’re the benefactors?” Omeka asked.

The question hung in the air, no one willing to speak. At that moment, they all felt the lights were so blinding. They assessed their surroundings, looking past their companions to the brutalist furniture and trappings around them. They all appeared so solemn, Clark thought, *if only we all did not just wake up, so grumpy they seem.*

For the next hour he held off. Once coffee was had and a hot breakfast served, a combination of warm pastries, meats, and eggs, the group dispersed to their assumed stations. Omeka made his way to the cockpit, the religious pair to the gym, Ronaldo to check his calculations, and Phoebe to her quarters. 

Clark wandered around with his camera, checking on each member and asking about their respective duties, “anything I can do for you?” he asked each of them. Most declined, all politely save for the pilot, who requested Clark leave him be as he did his work, seeing the Oort Cloud approaching menacingly. 

Clark lastly made his way to the quarters of Phoebe, to whom he posed a simple question: what is your story?

PHOEBE: I grew up in a nowhere place on the outer edges of the settled systems, claiming a no-one family whose name you’d never recognize in any of the annals of history. We farmed energy, like many families, harvesting the strong and raucous winds of a planet you’d swear was rogue.

We never found fortune, nay love, and hardly a living. My parents, all eight of them, tried their damndess, but keeping food on the table and water in our canteens increasingly difficult. 

I wrote of these troubles, and write I could. Through the radio waves careening toward the centers of civilization is where we finally found our respite, so pontificate I continued.

As our station in life improved, so my writing waned, one of my fathers ascertained this, his name was Alec. And through a combination of deliberate withholding of funds and the paychecks dwindling due to my own incompetence, my family became more scarce. Two siblings died of thirst before we knew it. They didn’t ask nor beg, at this point they knew better. They died silently in the night. One of my mothers then starved and thirsted herself to death to save some for the rest of us. This all happened in a matter of weeks. I was only twelve, and I was in shock. Destitute and desperate, a combination as common as peanut butter and jelly, Alec would neither grant me leave from my quarters nor water until I wrote, and wrote good. In those dark and hungry days my mind wandered and gave birth to the words Alec so sought. Too tired for a pen and pad, lest a typer, he provided me a recorder in which he’d transcribe and send out into to the void.

Why the other parents allowed this, I’ll never know. 

By my seventeenth birthday I was well-renowned in the scholar domain, but not a superstar or household name. This still allowed us to beef up our machines and truly provide us a living. At seventeen, once this was all settled, I requested to go to a writers expo on a planet in Alpha Centauri. Leave was granted, and I never returned.

Her story nearly leveled Clark, but he listened with a kind ear, never interjecting but asking questions when she paused to collect herself. He noticed a tone shift as she spoke her last few sentences, something he noted to remember.

Over the next day Clark tried to break the rest down, but found it impossible.

A day had past, and the Oort Cloud was well behind them. The first planets in the seven planet system approached, dotting their navigation systems in a perfect line.

“What are the odds of that?” Phoebe asked as they enjoyed a steaming dinner of pasta and red sauce.

“Impossible,” Ronaldo said in all his wisdom. “Got to be some glitch in the system.”

“Now that,” Omeka interjected, “is impossible.”

“We only know where we’re going, not why, such an odd thing,” Clark said.

“The Great Attractor,” Ronaldo added, sipping his wine. He reached into his breast pocket, revealing a pipe, which he lit.

“My understanding is we can’t see it, so they want us to go to it?” Phoebe asked.

“Yes,” Ronaldo said, his voice was low and plain, never hinting at any emotion. He puffed on his pipe, “there’s a sort of… block. None of our instruments can give us any information on what lies in the great beyond. For centuries we thought it a group of galaxies closely clustered together, but that proved not to be true.”

“Supermassive blackhole?” Ivan asked. He and Marilyn sat together, both dressed in black collarless dress shirts, dotted with white, blue, red, and purple dots, resembling the cosmos.

“Doubtful, but we shall see. Speaking of, I need to do my readings,” Ronaldo said before standing and exiting the common area. The blue smoke from his pipe following him as he strode toward his quarters.

The ship hummed quietly as they watched Ronaldo exit. Soon enough, as dinner was finished, all made their way to their quarters for rest, all save for Clark who cleaned up the common area.

Clark peered through the porthole as he placed dishes in the cleaning cabinet. He saw boundless and endless nothingness. No stars, galaxies, or nebulae greeted his eyes, and an eerie feeling fell over him. He could walk a trillion lifetimes and touch nothing. *Space,* what a good word. The blackest sea, the last frontier. So grand no species, no matter how much time, could fully chart and explore. He felt a tightness, like the walls were closing in, he looked back out into the nothingness and imagined a giant beast, black as the night, resting out there. Scaled skin, long claws, and a mouth made of a black hole.

It was hours later when the entire crew heard a shriek. They bolted from their quarters to see Omeka on the floor near a porthole. He looked pale even through his brown skin, his eyes were wide, yet resigned, like he’d looked god in the face and realized he was not benevolent.

All huddled to the the porthole. Some froze, some screamed, all felt strength leave their souls.

An ice giant planet greeted them. It bore a gorgeous deep blue with wisps of white. The blackness of space behind it still so ominous, yet, what no one could fathom was the blackness in the middle of the planet, perhaps even deeper than what they saw past it; and those wisps of white surrounding it in a ring…

“That—that’s a—,” Phoebe sputtered.

“No.”

“That’s an eye,” Clark whispered, horror in every syllable.

They felt it more than they saw it, fear making them stand still, like looking into the eyes of a tiger before it pounces upon your helpless body. They felt it searching them, it felt so all encompassing yet so minute—looking into their souls, to their pasts and future, and searching every atom that made them one by one, looking for the weakest link.

The eye-planet stood so large, seeming to grow as the seconds crawled by, like it was coming closer. The sheer size of it nearly filled the entire porthole, it was all they could see.

After an indeterminate amount of time they circled the table in the common area, heads bowed, coffee mugs steaming and pipes smoking. No one dared say a word. All were there save for Marilyn, she had not left the porthole. Dinner would be soon, yes? Clark thought so, he started it up and put forks and knives in front of everyone. Pristine stainless steel reflecting the harsh lighting right into his eyes, Omeka pushed his aside.

The coffee was cool and the pipes snuffed out when she joined the rest. Still, no one spoke. Until Marilyn did.

*The great attractor is who we seek, so elusive. We conquered Earth, lost her, some think her a legend, but she is not. We take to the stars like children playing on a highway, so naive.*

*Darkstar, Darkstar, it’ll find you where you are.*

*Darkstar, Darkstar, you are never too far.*

*We are not but fleas on a dog, nay, swine! Nay, a rat! Yet, our hubris is that of gods. Darkstar, Darkstar, STAY WHERE YOU ARE.*

*Our path was chosen, our fates transfixed, meet the Darkstar and soon be nixed.* 

Many jumped in, telling her to quiet or make sense. Phoebe sat silently, looking at her, Ivan nodded and encouraged.

*You all came here because you thought you had nothing to lose, or something to gain. You stake your minds so in the natural world, you fail to ascertain that there is more to lose than just your life; and what you’ll gain is far greater than pain, far greater than what one could ever explain.*

*You think its a coincidence that we’re all here? A coincidence that you’ve all lost so much you’d accept such a trip? The Darkstar chose you, followed you, and made your life as it is so you’d come to it.*

*We come looking for riches, answers, an intelligence to rival our own! What if, now listen closely, the Great Filter itself is calling us home.*

*How could a universe so boundless in riches be so quiet? Who are they afraid of? Now before you answer, take your time. I’d wager we’re the last ones left, or the next in line.*

Omeka stood up, “I’m turning this ship around.” His eyes had not returned to form. He looked death in the eyes, like fighting sleep, it would come to him sooner than he thought.

No one responded, he stood there stiff as a board. Phoebe shook her head, Clark sighed, Ronaldo said only ‘no’.

Suddenly, Omeka bolted to the cockpit, moving faster than anyone could expect with his large frame, but Marilyn was quicker, she somehow appeared in front of him, and a stainless steel knife was in his neck, then the lights went out.

The emergency lights turned on. How dim they were! A warning light system flashed red to accompany them. The group looked in horror as Omeka lay on the floor, Marilyn standing over him.

“He’s the lucky one,” was all she said and would ever say before she was tackled by Ronaldo, tied up, and put in the brig.

An hour later, their bearings had returned, and they discussed their next course of action. Though the red lights had stopped flashing, the lights still stayed dim. They found no solution to their problem, as no one else knew how to manually fly the starjet, and the auto piloting system would not listen to their commands. 

Then another one came.

This one, another deep blue, another eye. An ice giant searing its icy eye into their soul, burning like fire. They stood there as the minutes ticked away and they passed it by, looking in horror, as this time, they realized the planet’s eye followed them. Once it was out of view from the side porthole they ran to the back and into Phoebe’s quarters and looked through her porthole and sure enough, as the starjet left the planet in its theoretical wake, it was still staring straight at them.

“I’m going to sleep, I don’t care. I’ll go back into hibernation,” Ronaldo said sharply.

“And leave us with Ivan? I do not think he’s to be trusted,” Phoebe retorted.

“Give him a break, he didn’t kill anyone. He’s been nothing but passive,” Clark added.

“He came here with her.. They—they know each other. They worship the same deity, whoever the fuck it may be,” Phoebe said, exasperated.

“Phoebe, you of all people should be more tolerant… you’re a philosopher, right?” Clark asked.

“Fuck who I am and fuck who I was. I can’t comprehend what is happening, what she said.. Those eyes. I have never felt more naked.”

“Join me. We lock Ivan up to, and we all hibernate,” Ronaldo interjected. 

“No, I won’t do it. I won’t lock an innocent man up!” Clark shouted.

Just then, Ivan turned around. They found themselves in the common room again, and Ivan stood at the porthole, peering out solemnly.  “Ronaldo, you’ll want to see this,” he said.

After the last syllables left his mouth Ronaldo heard something he hadn’t, and thought he ever would, in years. His name, and the word ‘dad’ spoken simultaneously by three voices. His eyes went wider than before, he looked at Phoebe and Clark, who returned his gaze with confusion. “My family,” he whimpered, tears welling.

He sprang up and looked to the porthole, he saw nothing there so onto the cockpit he ran. There he found more windows to peer from. And sure enough, there they were, naked as far as space goes, wearing the clothes he last saw them in back at home, before he departed to the Eclipsis Space station for his studies. “Let us in, dad! Let us in!” his son waled. His hair floated above his head in a torrent of curls, Ronaldo held a flood of emotions back as he remembered his boy and his beautiful hair, why did he try so incessantly to get him to cut it? What a travesty it would have been if his son had given in.

“My love, please! We are so cold!” his wife pleaded, “the eyes, they follow us. The eyes never stop looking. The eyes, the eyes, please my love!”

“Please, dad!” his son and daughter pleaded in unison as they drifted past the ship. He sprinted out of the cockpit to the porthole in the common area where he saw them once more, still they plead and cried, and Ronaldo cried as well. They held onto the hull of the starjet, he saw their bodies beginning to freeze and crystallize. A cocktail of love, shame, hope, fear, and confusion engulfed him, but adrenaline kept his legs steady. Phoebe and Clark tried to corral him before he made his move toward the spacesuits, but he shrugged them off with ease and power. With effortless ease born from hundreds of times going in and out of spacesuits, he glided inside one, closed it up, and found the exit. He closed the hatch behind him and stood at the precipice, a thin film of light between him and nothingness, representing where the laws of physics began. He leapt from the meter long room and through the light, into the nothingness. By the time he turned to his left, the starjet was already out of view.

He searched the darkness for his lost family, screaming their names at the top of his lungs. After a few moments, he realized how they could never hear him in a vacuum, and how he could never hear them from outside the starjet, and how they were dead, reduced to bones by this time in the dark, marshy soil on Pluuvia. 

He wept as his wits came back to him, floating helplessly in the enormous void. He looked at the metrics on his suit. Days worth of sustenance. Days of floating in silence before he would begin to choke and starve. Release followed him, however. Although it was so dark in front of him he could scarcely tell if his eyes were closed or open, he felt something. A feeling he had not felt in a long while, but one he knew well. When was the last time he felt it? Yes, he was deep in his studies back on Pluuvia at home. His office was warm and candles lit, music filled the air. Jazz, how he’d loved Jazz. Sofia never did, but she pretended, he knew she did. His back was hunched over the computer as he typed, and he knew it was getting late, but he’d never know it was time for bed until *that* feeling arrived. Like a sixth sense, when he did feel it, he would turn around and see Sofia in the doorway, in her nightgown, her beauty unmatched in his eyes. Her big round eyes would meet his and she’d say, “I’m going to bed, love.” he would always respond, “would you like me to join you?” She’d give him a look, and a slight nod, and off they went.

His eyes welled, had she come to call him to bed once more? But, as his thrusters maneuvered him in a 180 degree motion, he felt something else. A sound, but no, it is a vacuum, his mind thought, now acting sharp. Perhaps something else. Once he had completely turned around what he saw astonished, frightened, and struck awe in him.

Another gas giant, red as an apple with an eye the size of thousands of Earths. It was so close that even as he turned his head he could scarcely see anything beyond it. The sound continued, but it was more a vibration, a hum, a welcoming. It got stronger, and as it did, so did the distance between them shrink. He cried, and he plead, it was no matter. He floated there helpless as the incomprehensibly large celestial body came toward him, its giant eye searching. Before a minute passed the iris was all he could see, and next… well, next, he was nothing.

Back on the starjet, Phoebe tried convincing Clark to seize Ivan. Clark stood steadfast, refusing. Arguing they must all stick together.

Stricken with fear and confusion, they tried hibernating as Ronaldo had suggested. But, similar to the auto piloting system, it did not work. After a few hours of trial and error they gave up. The next morning, after fitful sleep, they sat at the common room table, haggard. 

“We’re nearly there,” Ivan said calmly.

“What is going on here, Ivan?” Clark asked. “Please, please help us. At least tell us.”

“You mean to ask what will happen. That is something I wouldn’t dare to assume, for I am but a man. What is happening and has happened is quite clear. Marilyn spelled it out for you. We’re in a sort of tractor-beam right now, being pulled to the Great Attractor, the Great Void, Darkstar. Fate, similarly, has pulled you to this point in a tractor-beam like manner as well. Be grateful, and let the awe wash over you.”

“So there is nothing we can do?” Phoebe asked.

“No.”

Several hours passed, and the two grew more tired and wary. Before long, the eerie quiet and mild lighting aboard the starjet was interrupted. It started mildly, manifesting as a ringing in their ears that they couldn’t shake. It evolved into a low hum before growing increasingly loud. They went to the porthole and saw what appeared to be an incredibly dense asteroid field. Millions of rocks lay in their line of sight.

“I wouldn’t mind if one of them hit us,” Phoebe said, her voice whimpering.

“No eyes, thank g—“ Clark said, but he was interrupted by a whir of motion. Each and every asteroid in the field rotated sharply before stopping so abruptly it had to have broken the laws of physics, but of course they were past any sort of laws now. Once they stopped, Phoebe and Clark fell to the floor, but not before they saw it. Millions of eyes staring at them from the darkness. Feeling like caged animals in a packed zoo to an innumerable degree, they both wept on the floor, holding each other. The sound continue to grow louder. 

A short time passed before the sound became clear. A chorus of human screams. As the realization hit them, they began to hear things bump the hull of the starjet. They made their way to the cockpit, hands over ears, before seeing the incredible once again. Bodies flying at them. One held on, somehow, and looked inside. Its body an ash gray and its eyes ablaze with a red fire within, like it had burned from the outside in, flame traveling inward. It stared at them, unblinking, its mouth open wide, showing nothing but flame. Two more were holding on now, and the screaming reached such a volume it became truly unbearable, like shoving ice picks in each ear, over and over and over.

Clark and Phoebe sprinted to their quarters. Clark saw trickles of blood flowing from her ears, he touched his ear and found it wet. He screamed in pain, and heard nothing.

The pain was still there, though they kept running. Past Ivan, who they saw in the common room on his knees, smiling, and blood flowing from his own ears. 

As they entered the hallway, they were confronted by one of the beings. It stood incredibly tall, hunching over the doorway, its ashen hands outstretched, its mouth open wide, as they breathed they smelled burnt flesh and a smell that reminded Phoebe of a campfire. They diverted their path, seeing another being crawl its way through a porthole as if the glass was not there. As it landed on the floor, the already dim lights went out, replaced by the flashing red warning lights. 

The strobing effect was disorienting, and Phoebe in her panic, lost Clark. She went to the first room she found, the brig. She unlocked it, slid in, and closed the door. She justified this decision with the thought she would rather be with a crazed killer than whatever those things were.

Clark found no respite. He ran around, dodging the outstretched arms of the ashen, there had to be a dozen on the starjet. He circled back to the common room, seeing Ivan on the ground being… consumed. Three of the ashen crouched around his laying body, their heads bowed, mouths open pulling Ivan’s body into theirs in a string-link fashion, like they were pulling his body apart atom by atom into strings. 

He had seen enough.

Without a second thought, he followed the path Ronaldo had taken less than a day ago. Sprinting through the red strobing lights, dodging ashen, and not being able to hear a thing, he went to the airlock. With no spacesuit on he stood on the precipice just as Ronaldo did, though he was more hesitant. Though the door was closed behind him, He felt clawing hands at his back, turning around, he found an ashen halfway through the door, its mouth open in an endless scream he could no longer hear, its eyes ablaze with fire. He turned around, and jumped. 

Phoebe remained in the brig for an unknown amount of time. She shivered and hyperventilated, hand searching in the dark to ascertain her surroundings. She was alone. Where had Marilyn gone?

The self locking mechanism clicked open, and the door inched open. No light shone through, all she felt was dark and desolation. She inched her way out of the brig, unsure of what to do next. What she found through the halls and into the common area shocked her: nothing. It was as if nothing had occurred, and she had always been alone; not just on this voyage, but her entire life. A sort of incomprehensible dread of being the only of your kind, the only sentient being in a lifeless universe. But then, something called to her.

Slowly, she walked to the cockpit, and through the glass magnificence, horror, and awe found her. In the middle of her view, in the background, she saw *it,* or what she assumed to be it. The space beyond it was pitch black, but this, this hole of nothingness, how aptly it was named, this black hole stood there as if a king or god, the depths of nothingness deeper than the emptiness of space beyond it. Separating the two was a ring of light. *The accretion disc,* she thought.

Darkstar, darkstar, it will find where you are.

Her feeling of loneliness was replaced by that of a insect staring up at a meteor, heading straight to it. But something more, she felt seen. She felt, *felt*. This was no mere astronomical entity, no, it was a being. Not lifeless like a planet or moon, she was in the presence of something more. In the foreground she could make out shapes in the darkness, planets. Some, from their dark side, emitted lights resembling what could only be cities, civilizations. From the left and right she found dozens of stars, the size of small eggs if her arms were outreached. All these objects, including her and the starjet, floated ever closer to this being.

In desperation she called out to it, and before her thought was over a jolt of information was injected into her mind, not in the form of words, thoughts, or images but something higher, something that could be understood completely. In a rough translation, it went something like this:

*Planets, civilizations dawning across the young cosmos. Some dying of their own hand, others taking to the stars, going to far.*

*Those that did, would soon look up from their homes and farms, seeing a giant arm.* 

*A hand made of millions of fingers, grasping the rock and soil, ripping them from their orbit.*

*Regardless of what came before it, they would see it. The Darkstar. Sometimes it would be on their horizon, sometimes high above like a moon. Some welcomed it, some detested, but regardless their time came soon.*

She saw this in a million iterations across a span of time she could never fathom.

As she came back to, she saw it, the arm and the hand reaching for the nearest star. Darkstar grabbed at it eagerly, and pulled it in with a swiftness that surely broke every law of physics. A being above such laws, it seems.

In her mind, she asked why, and the response was a look into its essence, pure truth. Like someone asking you how their day was and you instead gave your whole life story.

What Darkstar said is translated here into human terms and phrases:

*There is no ‘why’ for a primordial being. It is not evil, such as a wolf is not evil for finding its next kill. Nature is nature. Watch as a preying mantis rips the head off of its next meal, it feels no disdain, shame, or sadness. It is what it is. It does what it must. I hold no views, nor ideals, I am here to do what I was born to do. Just as you breathe, I consume. Do you feel for the oxygen that enters your lungs and becomes a part of you?*

The arm snaked out once more, like a skeleton made of the blackest coal, its millions of fingers grasping the next star, and the next, pulling it towards its ending embrace.

*This is the order of things, you see. I have and always will be.*",1,1729038421.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Me and my partner have a 5 month old daughter. She is the smiliest, happiest little bean when we’re at home and seldom cries or gets upset however recently I have taken her out with my mum (her nana) and she has become so inconsolable to the point where we have had to cut the day short and take her home.

When out with me and my partner, she is absolutely fine. My partner took her to baby massage classes for 8 weeks and she was super content. It just seems to be when I’m out with her and my mum that she cries. We took her to soft play a few weeks ago and she cried so hard, her face became blotchy and even a bottle wouldn’t comfort her. As soon as we brought her home, she was smiling from ear to ear. Last week we took her to a coffee shop and left within minutes because again, she was absolutely screaming (and yep, smiley as anything as soon as she was back in the house). 

My mum is now taking it personally and tells me that it’s because my daughter dislikes her and that really hurts me. 

Does anyone have experience of with their baby crying around certain people and in certain places? I’m hoping she will grow out of it but any tips or advice on how to help her to calm down when I’m out and about would be much appreciated!

My skin doesn’t look bad, but my nasolabial folds have become more prominent in the past couple years. I’m not trying to look 20 forever, I just want to age as gracefully as possible. 

So today I went to a medspa for mainly cheek and lip filler, but I have the injector a budget and said that he could place the filler wherever he saw to be most fit. We were getting along well, and then he asked if I’m a runner bc I have lost a lot more volume in my cheeks than the rest of my peers. He even asked if he could get less filler in my lips so he could put more in my cheeks bc a subtle amount of filler in each cheek wouldn’t be enough. I don’t think he said this to upsell me bc he wanted to do this within the same budget.

I am almost never in the sun and when I do I use spf religiously. I have used prescription tret (.5) for a year now. I have my mom’s face and skin and I notice that she didn’t have the same issue at this age. I am thinking it is mostly caused by lifestyle factors and want to know what may specifically be causing this. Overall, I need to be healthier, but I’m wondering what most likely caused this, so I don’t change my whole life at once. 

Possible lifestyle factors causing premature volume loss: 

- prescribed adderall for 5 years now
- huge coffee and energy drinker
- never work out
- sleep on side
-have a really expressive face and smile a lot
- vitamin d deficiency 
- husband smokes around me and I smoked for two years in the past
- I’ve eaten mainly vegetarian while living in a country where that’s uncommon so it was hard for me to have perfect nutrition/ protein consumption throughout the years
- a couple years ago I dropped 30lbs from severely reducing my calories which caused me to lose weight really fast


Lifestyle factors working in my favor:
- I never sleep less than 8 hours
- lucky enough to live a pretty stress free life
- I’m at a healthy bmi 

Writing all this I see that I need to be healthier as a whole. But I want to see what are the most damaging of these bc my unhealthy lifestyle factors are things I enjoy and I don’t want to stop anything for only a minor difference. ",1,1729038240.0,u_GlitteringWitness471,1,1.0,False

Using 18g in, I’m getting around 80g out in 30 seconds. No obvious channeling / squirting on a bottomless portafilter.

I’m using the finest grind I can on the grinder. I bought some commercially ground grinds (setting 1 on a Malkonig machine) and it stalls the machine.

Backstory:

I bought a 2011 machine with poor head pressure. After a full descale and no improvement, I bought a new pump. Measuring on the portafilter now gives me 10 bars with https://www.shadesofcoffee.co.uk/universal-portafilter-mountable-0-16-bar-pressure-gauge---38-thread

I also have a Smart Grinder Pro, who I bought from someone with the same machine. They used grind setting 4 on it, and got decent output. I changed to 1, and ended up with bitter coffee and a huge volume of it. I even took the internal grind calibration down to the finest setting and had the same results. Lance Hendrick uses 11 on the same machine.

I even attempted to use a pressurised basket I got from the previous owner. It’s possible it’s faulty, but the coffee squirted out so fast it hit the portafilter splitter and doused the walls in coffee!

My best guess is that the pressure is too high. But that means my portafilter gauge is wrong.

Or, since I’m buying supermarket beans to try avoid spending crazy amounts diagnosing things, the beans are just awful. Having tried 7 bags of beans trying to diagnose things prior to buying a grinder, this is entirely likely.

1g4mfuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1g4mfuq/poketober_progress/,Poketober Progress ,"Edit: (They are showing now, okay)

Every year I've watched Inktober come and by wishing I'd make something for it, so this year I decided to buckle up and do it.  Before now, my main strengths were in line art, but coloring has always been on the harder side to do, so it started out rough.  Also, I know some of the kana/kanji are not traditionally used in some of the ways I use them, sorry in advance.

So, on Day 1, my goal was just to do something, anything.  It was messy, but it was made.  I wanted to emulate the old youkai painting where they sometimes color outside the lines in an artistic way, but kinda failed at that.

On Day 2, I tried that again, just to keep going with the idea.

Day 3, I took a step back, and decided it wasn't working, and I wasn't happy, so started go to the basics with a calligraphy brush, and focus on clean flat colors.  I referenced Demon Slayer for the Water effects as well.

Day 4, was mostly more of the same, with the intent of starting to add flat cel shading.  Edges were left hard on the cels.

Day 5, I wanted the lines to look cleaner, experiment with more shading, and then accidentally made the blue aura effect using a selection on a vector layer, and ran with it.

Day 6, was the first day I tried lighting, just a little bit.  Turns out amber lighting is a nice cheat.  Had fun with a new brush for the fire effects as well.

Day 7, Tried using non black outlines for the first time, and made some scuffed butterflies.

Day 8, I decided to dabble with the smudge tool to fluff out the shaded cels to emulate fur.  Got lazy with the fire because this one took a bit longer.

Day 9, I started growing out of the Japanese youkai parchment style theme, but not yet.  But I want to mess around with more brushes and backgrounds and effects.

Day 10, I swear it's only 9 tails, the one is just extra long.  But I started dabbling with backgrounds here, even if they're not very related to the character yet.

By here, I decide to ditch the youkai theme, since I'm more interested in learning more about coloring now.

Day 11, continuing the trend of the previous day, I started using masks from the inside of the line layer, along with the spray paint brush to shade the tails.  Was kind of happy with that, even if the body turned out a bit of a mess.  I also discovered I like the texture of the pointillism brush and spammed it on the trees.  Also poor man's attempt at Bob Ross emulation on the mountains in the background.  My favorite part was the aurora.  It's two layers of light teal, and a darker turqoise with an elongated vertical pen.  Then I merged the layers and smudged them together.  Finally, the sparkle brush for sprinkles on top.

Day 12, I picked Dragonair because I wanted something a lot simpler to line, but that gave freedom to color more.  Learned a new technique of shading today, where I made new layers for the cels and was able to lay down flat cels for the shadows and highlights a lot faster using masks.  I also am still spamming that pointillism brush on the clouds in the background, changing hues on different layers to try to make something that resembles a cloud.  Finally, got the idea to make a gradient for the sky background, and then some light gouche brushing over it to make it less smooth.  A little bit of blotting ink too for texture.  Kind of random, but it was something I got familiar with the first few days of parchment/coffee stain emulation.

Day 13, Using softer brushes for clouds, and realized I could just try to highlight them like the pokemon, so I think they came out better.  I still really don't know what I'm doing with the backgrounds beyond referencingmy own photos, and spamming random brushes.  Pointillism coming in on the river once again, but I decided to shade that as well.  I intended for more rock work in this one but for now, vague blurs of colors is the best I got for backgrounds.

Day 14, First attempt at a closeup shot, and it was fun.  I am still using amber lighting as a crutch here, always works for 3D level design, so that stands true here, too.  Went back to watch some more Bob for the trees, and they're well, better.  Not great, but better.  The past few days also got a fair amount of improved linework from friends watching stream, so thanks to them for helping clean these two up.  Biggest regret is experimenting with different colored outlines this day.  It makes the flower neck piece look a little flat.  I think it would've been better with the same green outline.

1g4mfqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1g4mfqp/today_was_weird/,Today was weird,"The guy shows up to resurface my bathtub. He looks like my/the ex-fiance. It was such an eery feeling. We've been broken up for two years and if his heart should change I would actually consider taking him back. I miss our good days. But then reality reminds me that he was a bit of a monster. These have been the thoughts of my heart for the last few months, then this guy shows up. I shared a picture to show him the similarity and his eyes widened. He couldn't believe it either. Then the guy starts to flirt. I stopped him in his tracks. Dude was on the job...and looked too much like my ex. The hair, jawline, complexion, eyes, even the potbelly.

Then my neighbor whom I thought was a friend. I can't use the tub for the next 48 hours so I ask if I could take a quick shower at her place tomorrow morning. She walked to my apt about an hour later, complained of being able to smell the epoxy odors from her apt, and in between random chatter about my headache, the guy, and my 5 mile morning walks, she tells me that I ""will just need to take a bird bath because we all go through things in life and it's only temporary."" Now, she and her boyfriend do not have a car. My very old car is old old and rusty but it works...or was working until last week. I've never requested or accepted money from her the one time she did offer and  even overtaxed my old car by driving it across town to help her out. For the last several months I have driven her around and called her when I was headed to the grocery store or other places she shopped at. And it was cool. The neighborly, friendly thing to do, right? We've shared stories about random things as friends do. This week, she only contacted me to ask for stuff ( coffee, art materials) and I gave her freely, over and beyond ( a whole bag of my favorite Italian brand of coffee and the rest of the medium I was using). And it was cool, you know... neighbors...friends. But when she literally told me to take a bird bath after alllllll the free rides and shared dishes, I felt like someone spat in my face.

Now the crazy thing: Just THIS MORNING, my prayer to God was to surround me with people who Jesus would  KNOW ( in the spirit of Matthew 7:23 and similar verses where Jesus tells performative folks to get away from him because he doesn't ""know"" them). I prayed this prayer and added the idea that even if it meant walking alone for a little while, know me and surround me with people you know because I am so sick of giving up parts of me to people who only trample over me when they decide I am of no more use to them. 

I am a little hurt by her choice and the harshness of it, but at the same time I am grateful for the timing and her showing her true self. Her stories about all the shady dealings with other friends played back in my head today. I hope this is the last time I have to repeat this lesson. Shady people are just... shady and will use you like they use all the other people in their lives. Listen and take heed!

Now if only my hopes for steady income that more than covers my living expenses and allows me to continue sharing breakfast bags with the two homeless people I see each morning would manifest... this and my hopes for a reliable vehicle....May these  ""manifest"" just as quickly

Other: $1176.66

This was a really fun week for me. Spending looked fairly normal not including the vet visit. I knew the dog bill was coming out, so it's not technically counted in my monthly budget. I'm quite proud I didn't spend THAT much during the week. I'm a sucker on the weekend. I love supporting local businesses, so little purchases get made. 

My goal for the month is to reduce spontaneous spending. Only the flight and SC pop-up were spontaneous. Granted, I'd been wanting to travel for a while. My friend had a great proposition. We could stay at her friend's apartment. The weekend we're looking at was fairly cheap too, so I speed ran it. I find the first time I look up a route is the cheapest. No going back at that point. And I was right! Tickets were up $25 the next day. 

I genuinely think running has become a good money curb-er for me. It's a free activity and there's a huge community with it. It fuels both my desire to be fit and social. ",7,1729037470.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,1,1.0,False

Once, a student asked me, ""How do Italians express what they *really* need – like a *desperate* need for a cappuccino?"" And that sparked an animated Italian lesson featuring *avere bisogno di*. Imagine my surprise when half the class thought it meant we needed a priest! But seriously, it’s all about mastering this phrase to get the essentials right.

Here’s the lowdown:

- **The basics**: Use *avere bisogno di* to express a need. It's like saying ""I need"" – just roll with it!
- **Nouns**: Pair it with a noun. For instance, if you’re running on fumes, say, _Ho bisogno di un caffè_ (I need coffee).
- **Infinitive verbs**: Want to express a need to do something? Slip it in with an infinitive – _Ho bisogno di dormire_ means I need sleep (don't we all at times?).
  
Real-life application? Once, on a friend’s trip to Rome, feeling utterly exhausted, she said to a local, _Ho bisogno di dormire_. The Alfredo replied, ""Ah, vacation in Rome is not for that!"" Well played, Alfredo!

Cabrera looks down at his plate. Nothing but tiny crumbs left. For the life of him, he can’t explain how he ate it so fast. Nor can he explain how he can stomach any food while listening to something so grisly. From the corner of his eye, he sees Alvaro cringe; her cinnamon bun left untouched since the first bite. ﻿

Alvaro takes a sip of her coffee, instead. He debates internally, pondering whether to sneak his fork over and swipe it from her plate, or to wait a little longer. *Just another minute*... He sits, waiting impatiently for an end to the uncomfortable silence that hangs in the dining room.

Darling eyes Cabrera’s empty plate. “Before I continue, would you like some more, Detective? I can fetch another from the kitchen.”

“Yes, please!” He answers without hesitation, like a grateful, greedy little boy bubbling with excitement as he peers into a candy shop window. Off she goes with the empty plate. Cabrera sits tight, eagerly awaiting his second serving.

“This is absurd, just ridiculous!” Alvaro bursts with indignance. “Does she think we’d believe *that* story?”

He shrugs. “I’ve heard that a lot of crazy things happen in San Judas.”

“Oh, God, really now? Don’t start with your bizarro theories...”

“I mean, why not listen to what she’s got to say? She knows something about Jacobs’ death. And there could be clues she’s dropping in her story, no matter how ridiculous it sounds.”

Alvaro shakes her head and scoffs. “Jorge, she’s just conjuring up a fake story to distract us. We need to get her to the clinic. If not, then perhaps we can take something from the house that has her hair follicles, like a hairbrush or—”

“Elise, we can’t just take things without a warrant.”

“It’s probable cause. We don’t know what she has. She doesn’t know either. Maybe it’s-”

Darling waltzes into the room with a fresh plate of cinnamon bun for Cabrera. He salivates instantly. 

A smile appears on her round, matronly face. “I should tell you how I got my eyes back. That’s when things truly changed for me.”

Alvaro lets out a low, frustrated hiss through her teeth. “Mrs. Ross, where are we going with this? Tell us exactly what you know about Robert Jacobs!”

“I *will* tell you, dear. Be patient.”

The police discovered the boys’ organs in the fridge. Their limbs were out in the cemetery, right in the exact same spot where Bo had poked at that strange, dead creature. Their arms, legs, and torsos had been ripped to shreds, as if by a large animal. The house was searched. Every room, every crevice, and every little hole in the walls. But Momma was nowhere to be found.﻿

The boys’ deaths left people shaken, absolutely terrified. Mom became catatonic while Dad mostly went on as if everything was normal. He still went to work every day and read the Bible and prayed. But he stopped telling me stories. Instead, he would go out for long walks at night for hours at a time. Sometimes he wouldn’t come home until the next morning.

And no one believed me when I told them that the aswang took my eyes. Folks came up with their own theories. Some said I did it to get attention. But the doctors figured a rare disease—anophthalmia—was the cause of my missing eyes.

Since my family was Catholic, they believed it was God’s punishment for going into the house in the first place. Dad used to say: ‘Do not turn to mediums or necromancers; do not seek them out, and so make yourselves unclean by them.’

And, so in their minds, I was unclean. I knew—not *entirely*, it was more like a feeling—but I knew they blamed me for what happened to Junior. Like I should’ve gone straight home and told them what he’d been up to. They didn’t say or do anything. They wouldn’t even hold my hand to comfort me. I was all alone, left with no one to guide me in the darkness. And then, one night, Momma came to visit.

Momma didn’t have a form; but I could feel her presence all around me. The air felt different—heavier, tense, cold. But it was all strangely comforting. It embraced and consoled me.

*You’ll see again with my eyes*, she told me.

Then, this powerful force pushed me back onto the bed. My arms and legs were pinned down. I tried to wiggle away, but Momma was too strong. Then I realized that this itchy, pins-and-needles feeling was the work of dozens, even hundreds, of tiny spiders! Their little spindling legs crawled up my cheeks and into my eyes, burying into each socket.

I could feel them filling up to the breaking point, like balloons about to burst inside a tiny pore. The pressure kept building. I thought my head was going to explode!

When I finally woke up the next day, I saw gray silhouettes of items around my room. Little by little, sight returned to me. I could see everything! Clear as day! Colors! Light! My bedroom! But I also saw the horrified faces of my family, staring back at me. Mom fainted. Dad went white as a ghost and pissed in his pants.

He was the first to say something. And I will always remember what he said: Oh, my poor Darling, you have the eyes of the Devil!

He wasn’t wrong. I looked in the mirror and saw the Devil, too.

Since then, I hid behind bug-eyed sunglasses. I never took them off. Not ever. From that point on, my family wouldn’t even look at me. Dad lost his appetite. Mom fainted when she saw my Devil’s eyes. They told the school I had an eye operation that had gone wrong. I was a quiet student. No one bothered or noticed me. That is, until Clara Cooke came along.

Over forty years later I still can’t forget about her. In most people’s eyes she was a bubbly, cheerful girl. Everyone thought she had a little golden halo over her light-brown curls, like a Shirley Temple reincarnation. But she had a mean streak. Underneath the ‘good girl’ smile and rosy cheeks was a thoughtless, cold-hearted creature. She preyed on anyone she thought was beneath her.

She came up to me one day with her two sidekicks, and dared to ask me, ‘If you take the sunglasses off, like, do your eyes shrink when they’re in the light?’
I told her that I didn’t understand.

Clara laughed, and her goons laughed with her. I’ll never forget what that little monster said next. ‘You know, do your eyes get more chinky and, like, you can’t see? Is that why you wear those ugly sunglasses?’

She pretended to have slits for eyes. They all let out this roaring laughter, like they were werewolves howling at the moon.

I told them that I could see just fine and called them a bunch of dumb bitches. And then that girl laid a sunburning slap on my cheek so hard, it knocked off my sunglasses. I reached down to pick them up, but she crushed the lenses with her foot. I threw her the nastiest glare I could muster up. It reminded me of a Bible verse: ‘the eye is the lamp of your body; when your eyes are clear, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is bad, your whole body is full of darkness.’

Darkness filled every inch of my body in that moment.

The girls were so scared they almost shat their pants, and they scampered away. Still, that didn’t stop Clara from coming up with a nickname. Oh, she thought she was so clever. I heard the whispers; the talking behind my back. They called me Icky Iguana. By third period, the whole student body started calling me ‘Guana’, like it was my God-given birth name. The class wouldn’t stop their jabbering and pointing.

Our science teacher, Mr. Mann, hollered for everyone to shut up.

He demanded to know: ‘Who are you calling an iguana?’

Their eyes fell on me.

I tried to shrink away, down to the size of the smallest molecule. The left side of my sunglasses had cracked, and most of the right lens was missing. Mr. Mann took one look and clutched his chest like he was about to have a heart attack. He went up to the blackboard and lectured the class about the similarities and differences between iguana and crocodile eyes.

Students couldn’t stop giggling, and Clara had the widest shit-eating grin all over her fake, ‘innocent’ face. I wish I had the satisfaction of smacking it off. But I didn’t have to. Because, you see, this omnipotent being sent a miracle! Not God. Momma.

I watched that smile transform into a grimace in a heartbeat. Her hand flew to her throat like she got something stuck, and all of a sudden, her face was redder than a tomato. Then, she reached into her mouth and started pulling something out, like a magician with an endless rope of colorful cloth. The thing in her throat landed wet and hard on the floor.

It was the longest and fattest centipede I ever laid my eyes on!

The centipede crawled around the room. Dazed and confused. You should’ve seen the others. I thought their eyes were going to pop right out of their skulls! Clara birthed a dozen more out of that vile mouth. The last one was the biggest of them all. It opened up her mouth so wide, that once it pulled itself out, her lower jaw was dangling loosely off a single thread of muscle.

Oh, don’t worry. She lived. By sixth period, the whole town knew who Centi-Clara was. It made the front page of the county newspaper. TEN-FOOT INSECT CAUSES HAVOC AT SAN JUDAS HIGH! This made Mr. Mann upset, because centipedes aren’t insects, and the news editor had been his student.

The darkness that I had felt before faded. and gave way to light. Everyone thought I did it to her. Maybe I did, but do you know what that meant? Momma gave me a gift. No one in that school ever dared to cross me again.

Politely, Darling asks to be excused. She must attend to her sickly husband.﻿
“What the *fuck*!” Alvaro shouts once she is gone. “What are we doing here, Jorge? This is too much! Certainly, she’s not right in the head.”

Cabrera taps ‘pause’ on his smartphone. “You don’t believe her?”

Alvaro gawks at him, shaking her head in disbelief. “And you do? Did we not listen to the same story? The woman claims she lost her eyes and that an aswang—demon or witch or whatever she calls it— regrew her eyes with super spiders!”

“It’s possible.”

“You’re kidding, right? Jorge, come on.”

“I know you don’t believe in the supernatural, but I think if you just open...” He pauses and sighs. “Look, have I told you about my family?”

“No, you haven’t.”

“I haven’t?”

“You rarely talk about that part of your life.”

“I’m going to tell you something that I’ve never told anyone.”

Alvaro straightens up in her seat. A look of concern flashes across her face. “Okay, I’m listening.”

He fumbles with his fingers for a moment, hesitant to delve too deeply. No, I can’t. A bead of sweat drips down his forehead as he vacillates.  

*Come on*, says a voice from within. *It’s been three decades*. *Someone needs to know*. 

He’s entrusted Elise to have his back on the field. Maybe, then, he can trust her with his secrets, too.

“I had an older sister; her name was Elena,” he begins. “She was three years older than me. Just the best sister you could ask for. Our lives changed when she got sick, I think she was about twelve years old. At first, she had a fever and chills. Then she started refusing food, preferring raw, warm meat. She changed... transformed into something…”

He pauses for a moment, remembering the pale face of his sister, and the way she stared at him with ferocious, reptilian eyes.

“My parents took her to the doctors,” he continues, “but they had no idea what it was. Elena’s behavior grew worse, almost like an animal. She bit the nurse on the face. I was there. I saw her feed on a woman’s face! I knew that she wasn’t my sister anymore. She was gone and something else was inside of her.”

“Oh, God...” Alvaro gasps.

“The nurse survived, though she lost both eyes, most of her lips and about half of her nose.”

“What do you think was wrong with your sister?”

“It’s obvious, isn’t it? She was possessed.”

“Possessed?”

He nods. “By a demon.”

“A demon?”

Cabrera takes another bite of the cinnamon bun, registering Alvaro’s look of concerned disbelief. She may not believe it now, but he is certain she will come around. He licks the fork and dips into the bun again.

“Yes, a demon,” he says.

“So, what happened to Elena?”

“She escaped the hospital and was run over in a traffic accident. And as if it was all some cruel joke that God had played on us...my dad was the driver.”

“Oh, shit, I’m so sorry, Jorge. That must’ve been so traumatizing. But how does this connect to Mrs. Ross’s story?”

“I think she’s possessed, like how Elena was possessed.”

“How do you know that? Mrs. Ross seems fine.”

“It’s a feeling, Elise. Perhaps the demon inside her is dormant right now, and just waiting for the right time to strike.”

Cabrera lifts up the fork and dives in for another slice, but Alvaro slaps his hands away.

“Stop eating it,” she says.

“It’s rude not to finish what’s offered to you when you are a guest in someone else’s home.”

“We’re not houseguests. We’re investigators on official business!”

Alvaro gets up.

“Elise, wait,” he says, grabbing the cuff of her jacket. “Where are you going?”

“We need something that can tie her to Jacobs’ death.”

“How? We can’t just snoop around without a court order.”

Before Alvaro answers, the door swings open. Darling breezes into the dining room with a pot of coffee and a brand-new plate of cinnamon bun. She refills Cabrera’s mug and sets the plate down before him.

“I hope you’re not going just yet,” she says as Alvaro inches her way towards the door. “Oh, please stay, I haven’t finished my story.”

“Actually, I need to use the bathroom. So, where is it?”

“It’s under the stairs.”

Alvaro leaves the room, while Cabrera moans in delight as he digs into the second helping.

“Mmm…Well, don’t worry, Mrs. Ross,” he says. “I won’t be leaving until I’ve finished this.” He points to the bun and cuts off another piece. “But you’ve got to tell me your secret recipe for this!”

“Oh, it’s no secret,” Darling says, giggling. “I’m sure you can look up on the Internet and find a recipe.”

“But yours hits so differently!”

He licks his finger so as not to waste any of its sweet flavor.

Her smile widens. “Yes, well, maybe I did put a little more love, a little more care into it.”
The corded phone rings again.

Darling bolts from her chair, leaving it wobbling from the sudden movement. She strides over to the wall to pick it up and listens for what seems like a split second, before slamming it back on the hook. Not a word is spoken to the caller.

Cabrera resumes recording. “Okay, Mrs. Ross, let’s go on with the story. What did you mean when you said that Momma gave you a gift?”

“Let’s just say...I could do any and all things through her. It is she who strengthens me.”

“And your eyes...”

“My eyes? What about them?”

“You said they were unusual, but they look normal.”

“Well, that’s the miracle of contact lenses!”

“And the centipede incident, did that really happen?”

“I don’t lie.”

“Well, that’s good to know! So, let’s fast forward a bit to the part where you met your first husband.”

“Which one, dear?”

“Start with the first and we’ll go from there.”

Darling’s smile wavers, and her eyes sink. Tiny, inadvertent slips of the mask. Then she catches herself. And without hesitation the warm, maternal smile returns; lighting up her face from cheek to cheek. Memories of her past marriages resurface.

How do you do it?  Below is one way I do it.  ,"I have a large number of friends that are gifted.   There is a trust that I have with my gifted friends because their thought patterns and ways of thinking vary greatly, and I treat them uniquely.   

  
I see gifted through this lens:  ""unique ways of thinking""  - That seems to be the core trait among my gifted friends. 



It is typically brain damage for group leaders but to me it comes naturally to orchestrate a valuable conversation. 

  
Today a group of 5 other gifted people and myself got together and talked.  Where?  At a coffee shop.  

 The coffee shop meeting made me think of this Reddit group.  I do not really think about groups on Reddit much when I am not on Reddit but today I thought about Reddit and this group specifically.  

  
With an average person they would probably offend by either talking too much or interrupting or by being really harshly blunt and direct.    

  
What strategy do I typically use?  



Ask people to provide 3-4 examples whenever possible when they are sharing an idea.  



It is very simple asking for not 1 but 3-4 examples.  It seems to almost by magic diffuse tons of debates and arguments because to ""think of 3-4 examples"" really tones down the emotional tension very quickly.    It seems very, very, very hard for a person to give their 3-4 best examples of something and remain at a high negative tone.  

  
My labeling of them is never using their diagnosed label and just talking about the unique patters of thinking that they have.   I just say:  ""They have unique thinking patterns"".   I tell people that they have unique and often innovative ways of thinking. 

  
What is your take on this?

Becoming a better husband isn’t just about grand gestures or special occasions; it’s about showing up daily as a man committed to nurturing, protecting, and growing with his partner. 



Your relationship with your wife is a cornerstone of your life; when you invest in improving it, every other aspect of your life benefits.



Here are five ways you can strengthen your relationship with your wife and become the empowered husband she deserves:



1. Listen Actively: Try to truly hear what she’s saying without interrupting or trying to solve the problem immediately. Sometimes, all she needs is to feel understood and validated.



2. Show Appreciation Daily: Make it a point to acknowledge the little things she does and express gratitude. These small, everyday acts of appreciation build a foundation of love and respect and bring warmth and love to your relationship.



3. Quality Time Together is crucial to nurturing your bond. Whether it’s a weekly date night, a morning coffee together, or a walk in the park, set aside time without any distractions. This undivided attention can help strengthen your connection.



4. Communicate with Honesty and Vulnerability: Share your thoughts, feelings, and struggles openly. When you’re vulnerable, you create a safe space for your wife to be vulnerable, deepening your connection.



5. Support Her Goals and Aspirations: Show genuine interest in her dreams and actively help her pursue them. Supporting her ambitions fosters a relationship built on mutual growth and support and brings joy and fulfillment to your relationship.



Becoming your best husband starts with a decision to grow and improve. Schedule a complimentary call with me to discuss how you can take your relationship to the next level and become an empowered husband.



I’m launching a new cohort for men called Beyond the Provider: Redefining Manhood. It’s time to step into a new kind of leadership in your marriage.



Be Extraordinarily Bold!

Was hoping for a relaxing effect physically or possibly mentally but almost the exact opposite seems to be occurring. I’ve noticed that it definitely gives me energy… but almost in a wired anxious way. I’ve also noticed it seems to make me sweat, upper lip, face feels hot, sweating in areas that I usually don’t it feels odd.

Trying to see if this is a common occurrence or what it could mean if anything? L theanine has been great as far as relaxing for me.

Lysine is like a godsend for hsv outbreaks. But taurine the one I was actually most excited for has let me down 😫

Help!,"So I'm a college freshman with my earliest class being at 9 AM, but I like to wake up some hours earlier to try and get some time to read my bible and / or work out. In high school, this wasn't too much of a problem and I was able to keep things consistent. And then, after this semester started, I was able to continue that schedule pretty well.

All of a sudden, I'm oversleeping my alarms and not only end up not having time to do the things that I want to do, but also the things I need to do. It started worrying and bothering me when I'd finally get out of bed only 10 minutes before class started, only giving me time to put on some clothes, brew coffee to drink in class, and walk to class. This bothers me because I usually always start my mornings with a shower and some time to take care of my facial and oral hygiene.

Working out is gradually becoming a requirement for me, as my dad and I have recently started doing mini-marathons and spartan courses. 

I really need to start getting out of bed earlier, but it almost feels impossible at times. I haven't taken too drastic measures, but my methods of my sleep schedule mainly include taking 5g of melatonin and a small cup of water, and going to bed anywhere between 10 and 11. My first alarm starts at 6, giving me the recommended amount of at least 8 hours of sleep, and then multiple more alarms at 15 minute intervals. I also have an alarm on the other side of the room that acts as an artificial sunrise, but its rather ineffective.

To combat this, I plan on removing my blackout curtains to let in natural light as the sun rises, giving my internal clock a better wakeup call. I could also get some of those outlets that connect to my google home to connect to some bright lamps so that my room is illuminated indefinitely, rather than my sunrise alarm only being lit for 30 minutes and then turning itself off.

I'm staying open about this to those who mentor and council me through my mental troubles, so I have help in that region. Are there other tips or methods that may help me in my wakeup process?",1,1729036042.0,sleep,3,1.0,False

Is the X100VI all hype?,"I know flavors of this have been asked here before, but I’m looking for some holistic feedback and appreciate the help!

TLDR: I have a lot of film cameras and want a stripped down digital camera for travel. My search has led me to the X100VI. Am I falling prey to the hype?

I’ve been shooting film for 10 years now. I got into it after drunk-buying a Nikon F3 on eBay and have been hooked ever since. I now own 8 different film cameras and use almost exclusively 28mm and 50mm equivalent lenses for street and travel photography. As life has gotten busier, I’ve been simplifying my work flow by outsourcing the processing to a lab, but I still do my own scanning. I find that the more steps there are between releasing the shutter and the final result, the less likely I am to take photos. 

I still love film and want to continue with it, but I’ve started a new job that allows for frequent travel, but short trips. I often only have 1 or 2 hours of free time, like when I’m grabbing lunch or a coffee before heading back to the airport. It’s just not practical to commit to one type of film and then feel pressured to either shoot the whole roll or risk sending it through the x-ray in the camera over multiple trips. I never bring a camera as a result and feel like I’m missing out on opportunities.

This is why I’ve been toying with acquiring an X100. It seems to fit my goals perfectly: simple, small enough to fit in a cross body bag, but with the quality and control I’ve come to expect from some of the higher end film cameras I have bought. My desire is to continue shooting film in a more intentional manner, like when I’m traveling for pleasure and have more than one day in a city. For work trips or when I am hiking and do not want the weight of a film system, I’d like something like the X100. 

My fear though is that as I get more used to digital, I’ll quickly outgrow the X100. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Is it worth spending more on something like an A7Cii for the added flexibility?",1,1729035828.0,AskPhotography,6,1.0,False

I reactivated my AM account. Responded to someone who actually read my profile. Conversation felt easy. We met for coffee. He was as hot as his pics. I was pleased, he was pleased. We had easy conversation, laughed… there were sparks. Had a very hot kiss in his truck. Made plans to have a hotel meet for this coming Thursday. 

Two days later he gives me a heads up that he’s OOT with the fam for the weekend. No problem for me, I get it. Heard from him when he returned home Sunday night. Great. Got breadcrumbs from him yesterday, one of which was, “Are we still on for Thursday?” I said yes.

I am very, very clear in my profile about what I’m looking for. I reiterated it during our conversation at the coffee shop. I checked back on our previous messages to make sure that I made clear my expectations of what I was looking for. 

I’ve heard ZERO from him today. So, as much as it pains me because I really know that physically I would enjoy him, I’m going to tell him it isn’t happening.  The breadcrumbing is  just foreshadowing for Thursday either being a one off or him thinking that all he has to do is make appointments with me for sex and drop me a few crumbs. Well, I’m not signing up for that.

This is a rhetorical question, but WTF? So disappointing. I’m just gonna keep my AM account deactivated for now. I’m not in the mood for more bs. I was really looking forward to the manhandling and orgasms too. Jerk. 😠",10,1729035826.0,adultery,4,0.92,False
1g4luw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1g4luw1/labs_concern/,Labs Concern,"27M, 5’11 180lbs, no medications

Just had some annual labs done, plus a few from my sleep specialist. I wasn’t expecting the low RBC or high iron.

A few things to add, I’m a mostly healthy and fit guy. I lift weights 3x a week. I started a somewhat half ass carnivore diet about 2 months ago mainly as an elimination. Sausage for breakfast, steak for lunch, and then I’ll have carbs with dinner (pasta, rice, etc.). I only drink water and an occasional coffee.

As far as symptoms, I sort of chronically have fatigue and low energy. Bad sleep (OSA), my sleep inertia is AWFUL and I rarely get REM. My cardio performance as far as the gym has gone in the toilet the past year or so, but I’m also a recently solo dad of 2 young kids so I figured it’s all just part of it.

I also was diagnosed with a neurocardiogenic syncope that only happened during the recovery phase after exercise about 2 years ago when I was in Colorado Springs, which I attributed to the altitude. My HR gets insanely high when doing any high intensity stuff (175+).

Sorry if I’m rambling idk what’s relevant 🤣 

Are these labs concerning or am I just reaching? If they are concerning could my recent diet changes be related at all?

This is a reminder that scammers will *often* target WTB threads for most, if not all, marketplace subs.  

Please remember these helpful tips:  

- ***Do not*** reply to any chats/PMs, in reference to your WTB comment, when the user hasn’t replied to your comment first!
- ***Do ask*** for *current* timestamps and confirm photos. Honest sellers should easily be able to provide a *current* timestamp for their items, just like a WTS post. ***Don’t*** accept old dates on timestamps. Make sure to confirm photos are not edited and the timestamp is *handwritten*!
- ***Do*** please double-check the Universal Scammer List, before committing: [USL](https://www.universalscammerlist.com) - *Remember, you can always block a user to prevent any further contact from them.*  

***Pro Tip:*** If you want a *little extra* insurance that the timestamp photos you are being provided are authentic, and not photoshopped, ask the seller to include a common item, **of your choosing,** in the photo next to the timestamp (e.g. a shoe, coffee mug, computer mouse, utensil, etc.) If the seller refuses, run. It should also be clear if the item was added by AI or photoshop.

I definitely burned the outer edges a bit, but after about 20 minutes I managed to get the beans completely dry and heard the 'pop' sound that the beans are supposed to make while roasting.

My mom and I tend to argue a lot, most of the time it starts off as something small but I get easily irritated and catch an attitude with her, which devolves into an argument. Our arguments usually always come back to the same thing about her telling me I am trying to act grown or I am entitled or I am just plain selfish. Now I am writing this because I think yesterday was the straw that broke the camel's back. We had just returned from a vacation and I ordered coffee on the plane. For some context, I have a genetic condition that makes me prone to high blood pressure as well as other things that limit my ability to eat some foods. I don't usually care about that because I drink coffee normally and I am on medication for it so I ordered the drink anyway. When my mom found out that I ordered the coffee she blew up and started saying that I sickened her, and stressed her out. After that, she didn't speak to me the rest of the flight and just handed me my passport and said nothing for the rest of the flight. We also had a connecting flight to catch but she distanced herself away from me in the airport and refused to speak to me. Anytime I tried to speak to me, like telling her I was going to the bathroom she would ask me why I was telling her this, and if I wanted to be grown I should go be grown. Today she asked to talk with me and told me that she was done. I constantly stress her out and she needs to prioritize herself. She said that I don't care about her and that I only care about her when she blows up and when I worry about her it's fake. I genuinely don't know where to go from here and I'm starting to think I'm a really bad person. I know I am a shitty listener and I do have a big role to play in this because I actively choose to do things she tells me not to do, but sometimes I just don't care, and I feel like she may overreact to the smallest things I do. Maybe these things just stack on top of each other, but I don't know how to change my behavior. At first, I would kind of brush off what she said but now I am realizing I may be really selfish. How do I make it right with my mom?

1g4llhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1g4llhh/all_the_heroes_are_in_an_inkobowl_and_fighting/,"All the heroes are in an ""Inkobowl"" and fighting for her attention","Inko is a reporter, someone that covers what villains attack happened and the heroes that are involved, it's not just villain attacks, it could be something simpler like interviewing a hero after they release some merch or something.

What sets her apart, is that she actually respects boundaries, unlike those papparazzi that hound at the heroes, she backs off whenever she accidentally stumbles upon anything that she knows the heroes wouldn't want, she isn't constantly after ""The scoop"" and doesn't pester them for personal lives, and will call heroes out on their misconduct, whenever coming across underground heroes, she will keep it silent even without them asking, even when reporting villains, she gives the motives and in some cases gives a sympathizing perspective, giving her some favor amongst villains and she is seen as a professional investigative reporter.

But this also gets her some attention.

Due to Inko's non invasive nature, this causes a lot of heroes to be very willing to interview with her, and after a lot of interviews they will talk, and some even go on impromptu ""dates"" with her, where they'll hang out.

Heroes will genuinely fight to secure some of Inko's time, because she is just so damn likeable! Villains will purposely go near places she frequents to do crime, just to see them on the news in the future written under her pen.

However, they always thought they never had a chance, given that sometimes Inko will bring her young starry eyed son along, Izuku, another blessing upon this earth, though quirkless, he will ask the best questions, and aims to follow in his mother's footsteps and a lot of his questions are actually the ones that end up in the final article!

Given the fact she has a son, they all thought she had a husband, but one day after she was finished doing an interview with the wild wild pussycats, Pixie bob was once again groaning about her lack of a partner.

""Haha!"" Inko chuckled. ""Yeah the single life is hard!""

""Your man is probably such a good husband, Inko, just look at how Izuku is growing up! Last year of middle school and one of the smartest kids I've met!""

""Thank you! but, I don't have a man, I'm single! Single mothers don't get much attention these days!""

After that, word spread across the hero world that she is single as they all try to learn what she likes, and the main point of attack: Izuku.

They would always try to secure time with Izuku to gain his favor and gain favor with Inko, essentially becoming aunts and uncles to the young boy.

Even the villains would immediatley flee, the moment Izuku gets anywhere near their crime scene and they will covertly try to hide their villain identity to go on dates with her, causing Izuku to help her ""vet"" them out.

The heroes would berate one of their own, if Inko was ever injured during a villain attack under their supervision, and would be forbidden from going hear her for two weeks, even though Inko doesnt blame them.

And something that could be included is like a ""dekubowl"" where Inko would regularly meet with many others and their kids will mingle with Izuku,

The most common interaction is him with a blunt frog girl who's parents are the lawyers at Inko's news organization and TV channel. Dealing with charges like defamation and such.

Meeting the musicians behind one of the news stations, Izuku made a certain purple haired earjacked girl his friend.

Meeting a very stiff and robotic boy after an interview with Ingenium

After the whole fiasco of Endeavour being an abuser is revealed, meeting a peppermint boy when interviewing the mother, Rei.

Meeting a mochi loving brunette after meeting the company that handles some of the reconstruction after villain attacks.

The daughter of the host of a paleontology show on the Tv station that regularly leaves severed limbs in random places.

Meeting an onyx eyed long haired ravenette after an investor meeting.

A kind red head family that Inko met at her gym while trying to get fit. Their daugther seems really strong! Especially her hands.

All the children will want to spend time with ""Ms Midoriya"" and ""Zuku"" but defintely not because they like them!

Ideas:

When All For One and All Might see each other in a flowershop both reaching out to the bouquet full of flowers Inko likes, they look at each other before coming to a silent agreement, to let each other go out with Inko one last time before fighting.

Mirko, after defeating another villain, the reporters swarm for a statement, as she pushes through all of them and only gives Inko her time of day, all the while subtly trying to slip Inko invitations to coffee.

The UA, Shiketsu, Ketsubutsu and other heroes who teach at the hero school offering ludicrous conditions just for Izuku to go to their school.

The heroes all scramble to ""kidnap"" Izuku for a good time hanging out, whether it's Present Mic taking him to the radio station or Ms Joke taking him to a comedy show, Hawks taking him on a joy fly at this point Inko is just used to this.

So one day I was working and my wife had messaged me to let me know he was coming over for coffee totally fine. But once I found out he was still at my house with my wife I had started to get a little uncomfortable. So after about 4-5 hours of “coffee” he left. 

I confronted my wife about it and the only thing she had said was it was just coffee nothing more.

                               A Year Later
The same dude messaged us on (fetlife) asking when they was going to fuck again. So I question my wife once again, but this time her story changed to (I only made out with him). Dude kept messaging us pretty much degrading me saying that “my small cock wasn’t enough for her and that I should let my wife have coffee with big dick white boys”. So as soon as I got back home from work I asked to just tell me the truth. Her words “ he picked me up and sat me on his lap making out and sucking on my tits”, I asked her if that was it and she was hesitant and said “I sucked him to”. I didn’t fuck him, he had left.

Till this day I still believe she did fuck him and that she cheated on me. But at the same time the whole thought excites me to the point that I’m either fucking her thanking about it or jerking off to the thought of my wife cheating on me.

What do you guys thank? She told me no but he said he fucked her good. I’m 50/50 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️

1g4lkpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1g4lkpr/bcaas_and_eaas_useful_or_waste_of_money/,BCAAs and EAAs: Useful or Waste of Money?,"**By Luis Villaseñor, BS in Nutrition, Ketogains & DrinkLMNT co-founder**

At Ketogains, we emphasize a whole-food, protein-focused approach to nutrition, ensuring our clients optimize muscle gain, fat loss, and overall health. One topic that frequently comes up is the use of BCAAs (Branched-Chain Amino Acids) and EAAs (Essential Amino Acids) as supplements. Are they necessary? The simple answer is: if you're consuming an adequate amount of protein through your diet, they’re generally not required - and more so, I would say they are a waste of your money which could be used better for whole food sources of protein.



# What Are BCAAs and EAAs?

BCAAs refer to three specific amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, and valine. These three are called ""branched-chain"" because of their chemical structure, and they are essential for muscle protein synthesis and energy production, particularly during exercise.

EAAs, on the other hand, are Essential Amino Acids—nine amino acids that your body cannot produce on its own and must be obtained through your diet. They include leucine, isoleucine, valine, along with lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, histidine, and tryptophan. Both BCAAs and EAAs are essential for building and repairing muscle tissue, especially after training.



# Why Are They Unnecessary When You Consume Enough Protein?

Let’s start with the basics: virtually any whole protein source (such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy, or whey protein) already contains all nine essential amino acids, including the BCAAs. For example, whey protein—one of the most bioavailable and complete protein sources—provides ample amounts of both BCAAs and EAAs. When you're consuming enough protein from quality sources throughout the day, supplementing with either BCAAs or EAAs becomes redundant.

Research supports this view. Studies like [Nakayama et al. (2018)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29671767/) demonstrated that a hydrolyzed whey protein shake can elevate blood amino acid levels just as fast as an EAA supplement. In fact, [Rérat et al. (1998)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3044443/) found that whole protein sources, such as hydrolyzed milk proteins, raised blood amino acid levels faster than free-form amino acids. Simply put, whey protein does the job of both BCAA and EAA supplements at a fraction of the cost.



# Why We Recommend a Pre-Training Whey Shake (The Ketogains Coffee) at Ketogains

If you follow the Ketogains protocol, you know we suggest having the “Ketogains Pre-Workout Coffee” which includes whey protein, as it provides a quick and easily digestible source of amino acids, particularly leucine (the amino acid most responsible for triggering muscle protein synthesis). Whey also contains all the EAAs and BCAAs you need for optimal recovery and muscle growth. A dose of around 25 grams of whey protein taken 20-30 minutes before training will supply your body with the necessary building blocks to repair and build muscle and synchronize the MPS (muscle protein synthesis) from training along with the building blocks for muscle, which is the protein.



# The Myths About BCAAs and EAAs

There’s a popular notion that BCAAs help prevent muscle breakdown during training. While BCAAs are indeed crucial for muscle protein synthesis, research shows that they are not superior to whole protein sources like whey. In fact, for muscle-building, leucine from BCAAs works better in synergy with the other essential amino acids found in complete proteins. Without the full profile of EAAs, your body won’t maximize muscle protein synthesis.

Additionally, EAAs are often marketed as a fast-absorbing, superior alternative to whole protein. However, studies like those by Nakayama (2018) show that whey protein—especially in its hydrolyzed form—can raise blood amino acid levels just as fast, making EAAs largely unnecessary if you are already consuming whey or other complete protein sources around your training sessions.



# Should You Spend on BCAAs or EAAs?

In most cases, if you're following a well-structured protein-rich diet—whether you’re on keto, low-carb, or a standard diet—spending money on BCAA or EAA supplements isn't necessary. They’re typically 3-5 times more expensive per gram of protein than whey, without offering additional benefits. You’d be better off investing in high-quality whey protein or even better, ensuring your whole-food protein intake is sufficient.



# Practical Takeaways for Ketogains Followers:

1. Prioritize Whole Protein Sources: meats, fish, eggs, and whey protein contain all the EAAs and BCAAs you need. Aim for a minimum protein intake of 1.2g grams of protein per lean lb you weight (or 2.2g per lean kg you weight) daily, as per Ketogains recommendations. This usually ends at around 120g for most females and over 150g for most males.

2. Use Whey Protein Pre-Training: A whey protein shake (25g) as per the Ketogains pre-workout formula before your strength training workout will provide all the essential amino acids, particularly leucine, to kickstart muscle protein synthesis.

3. Avoid BCAA and EAA Supplements: Unless you're in a very specific context (like eating a vegan diet), BCAA and EAA supplements are generally unnecessary and cost-prohibitive. Stick with whey, casein, egg white protein, or whole-food protein sources to meet your amino acid needs.

4. Nutrient Timing Matters: Focus on getting high-quality protein at regular intervals throughout the day, with a specific emphasis on pre-and post-workout meals to optimize muscle repair and growth. 2 whole foof meals of at least 40g protein each, plus a pre-training protein shake (the Ketogains coffee) is more than enough for most people.



At Ketogains, our philosophy is about using what works—based on science and practical application. When it comes to muscle recovery and growth, whole-food protein sources and whey protein are more than enough to meet your needs. Skip the expensive BCAA and EAA supplements, and focus on adequate protein intake for sustainable results.

Your body and your wallet will thank you!

I’ve avoided all tree nuts for over twenty years, as my parents interpreted my initial testing as an overall tree nut allergy. Recently, I found out about the allergen pairs — like walnut/pecan and pistachio/cashew allergies going together. 

While looking into this, I saw that almonds were kind of their own thing and started to wonder if I might be able to tolerate them. My parents don’t have my original allergy testing results, but only remember walnuts, pecans, cashews, and pistachios specifically being flagged. 

I got a blood panel done, and got some expected results back (walnut/pecan and cashew/pistachio were flagged), and some surprises — almond was in the <.10 kU/L range. It was even lower than egg whites and peanuts, which I eat all the time without issue. I know that false positives are more likely than false negatives with these tests, so my next step is to see an allergist and see what they recommend. Because I’ve never actually reacted to almond, I’m hoping I might be able to do a food challenge and incorporate them into my diet. 

While pecans/walnuts are easy-ish to avoid, almond milk has really taken the world by storm in the last few years.  I’ve been stressed about it! The biggest thing that would change if I’m not actually allergic to almonds, would be being able to order coffee and bubble tea at places that offer almond milk. Obviously it all depends on what the allergist says, but I’m excited to find out either way. ",1,1729034980.0,FoodAllergies,1,1.0,False

I (27F) have been dating my boyfriend (30M) for almost 6 years. The relationship with my MIL has been great - so much so I’d consider us close (up until what happened last weekend). 
My boyfriend has two brothers: One 36M and 33F. They’re both quite “odd” and have not been close to my boyfriend (or at least the last couple of years). My bf and his brother got into a real nasty fight in 2020 - into which the parents took the brothers side and have been pressuring him into an apology and “moving on” for the sake of a “close family”. My MIL has been super annoying about this issue for quite some time, she always sneaks up comments about how “I should talk to my bf” and help solve this issue, labeling it as “pride”. To which I have not been receptive tbh, since I’d side with my bf in a heartbeat. And I truly do not believe my boyfriend was in the wrong to begin with. 

Fast forward to last weekend - we all traveled to my boyfriend’s cousins wedding. My boyfriend and I booked all our accommodations with plenty of time beforehand, and were the first to confirm our whole weekend stay and attendance. 

My boyfriends sister was being super weird, she originally said (and confirmed) that she would not be attending the wedding. Since it was “expensive”. However, their grandma died suddenly and she decided she was attending the funeral with last minute flights and the “possibility” of going to the wedding. To everyone’s surprise, she ended up going. 

The only context I have for the sister is that in the six years we have been dating - she has broken up with her boyfriend 3 times. One of which was a whole family drama because we were all vacationing together. Her “fiancée” / “husband” has a track record of being kind of a dumbass. He was super selfish all throughout COVID (making her stay in Canada with his family, even after they were rude towards her) and has been overall pretty unstable. So much so, that she broke down crying about her “difficult situation” with this dude and why she was unhappy in the relationship.

This has been going on for years. They break up, he returns to Canada and they start talking again. They rekindle their relationship, get back together and everything starts over again. 

Last time this happened was April (2024) in which “they were done for good”. So much so, that he wasn’t even accounted for in the wedding. Up until they got back together in June / July. 

Last weekend, he got a call whilst he was watching a soccer match with all his cousins. His sister is pregnant. And she broke down the news by saying “are you excited to be an uncle?” - followed by his mom screaming she was going to be a grandma.

Obviously my boyfriend was not excited nor happy. And he stated multiple times that he “had to pretend” over the phone but that the reality is quite different. He ran upstairs and told me all about to. To which, I am not surprised since I had been calling this out for the last year or so. I truly felt it deep inside me that the only missing thing was her getting pregnant knowing damn well she was not happy / wanted to stay with him. 

The whole weekend was planned for the wedding, with different events each day. And everyone else was in a wedding mood - not a baby mood. My boyfriend thought he was being weird about it, so when we talked to all of his cousins, they agreed that the sentiment was not of “excitement” nor happiness. But everyone felt some type of way about it. We all agreed that the original plan was to celebrate my boyfriends cousins wedding, and that maybe she should’ve kept the “secret” until sunday, after the wedding ended. 

On Friday, we were attending a salsa class, in which we had to follow the instructor. This was late pm and we were all super excited. 

My MIL arrived to this place and her greet was “I COULD CRY, IM GONNA BE A GRANDMA” So I just smiled and nodded. My boyfriend did the same - we couldn’t have been MORE uncomfortable. But I was - I see his brother arrive and greet everyone except my bf and I (there’s this common rule that whoever arrives, says Hi) a couple of minutes go by and I see my boyfriends sister walk in with her man. Immediately, my mother in laws voice changed and she told me in a QUITE hostile and passive aggressive tone that her daughter was here, and that I should say hello. 

My heart dropped. Since I had seen this tone in action, but never towards me. 

I greeted her daughter and her husband, and quickly pulled my boyfriend to the side to tell him what had happened. I was in shock. I never expected that treatment and less so being that I am NOT her daughter or her direct family. Acting on orders with a nasty attitude is NOT my thing - and I wouldn’t have tolerated that tone with my own mom.

I was quite pissed tbh. And the rest of the night I ignored her as much as possible. 

Next morning, my boyfriend and I sit down to have breakfast. When we see his sister and brother in law seated in a table. We say hi and we go get our food. I see my in laws walking in (with my boyfriends brother) and I see he’s upset about something. We see in the corner of our eyes that the brother starts screaming and pointing at my MIL - when he leaves super upset just to return to get a coffee from the table we were sitting on. My boyfriend (on purpose) says “HI GOOD MORNING” to which he replies “Oh so now you do say hi, uneducated”. To be fair - when my boyfriend or I have had to greet him, we have done so. But following the rule, he should’ve greeted us yesterday. And I am ONE THOUSAND percent sure he ignored us on purpose.

They both start going back and forth - up until my MIL says “You are both (referring to me and my boyfriend” so rude and uneducated” “Why can’t you put some effort into it”. When I tell you I was GAGGED. My boyfriend immediately shut her down by reminding her that if she’s talking about someone it’s about him, and that if she has something to say it’s to him (not to me). And reminding her that I am NOT her direct family nor daughter, and that that attitude is NOT correct. 

She replies by saying that “she considers me as her family” and starts apologizing (which wasn’t sincere). My bf dad gets involved and everything became quite messy. I ended up sitting down in silence watching everything unfold. My mother in law started being super aggressive saying things like “thank you for breaking this family apart” (towards my BF) and started going off about my boyfriend not being happy about his sisters pregnancy. 

She went full in - and at some point my boyfriend told us to get up and leave (which we did). 

The wedding ceremony was that day, and my boyfriend (being a groomsmen) had to leave early. When I saw my in laws in the ceremony I waved at them - my MIL waved reluctantly. When the ceremony was over, she approached me and my boyfriend, greeted me as if I hadn’t greeted her before (hostile) and complimented my boyfriend (I know she was being rude on purpose, since my “regular” MIL would’ve complimented me as well). She said 2/3 words and left. 

By the time the after party was happening, I was absolutely done with her attitude. I will NEVER take disrespect from someone, specially because I did not do ANYTHING to her or her daughter, neither her son. I will not tolerate her hostility and her passive aggressive tones. She tried “chatting” with my boyfriend and I and I was completely uninterested. Honestly? I do not care. 

My boyfriends sister is extraordinarily offended with me as well - when I said goodbye the look on her face was pure hatred. As if I was responsible of my bfs feelings towards her and the whole situation. Frankly, I do not care if she’s pregnant. And it’s not for me to care, I do not have a close relationship with her, and I have seen her max 5 times. My boss recently got pregnant and I couldn’t pretend to care either, because WE WERE NOT CLOSE! - I will not be fake in my interactions. I am NOT rude but I am not fake either. If I don’t feel it, I won’t say it. 

The situation with my MIL does affect me though, because I did have a close relationship with her. But after all this - I won’t take her shit either. I am not her daughter to manipulate, guiltrip or force.

So, AITA? Should’ve I “pretended” and acted out the way my MIL wanted me to? ",8,1729034331.0,AITAH,6,0.91,False

1g4la31,https://www.reddit.com/r/agathachristie/comments/1g4la31/mysterious_affair_at_styles_ch_2/,Mysterious Affair at Styles — Ch 2,"I really like how this chapter basically leans into the mystery. Agatha Christie is over here just straight up telling us, ""Yeah, you know what's going to happen."" It doesn't make us feel like we're being left in the dark — nor will it make the characters seem silly for not anticipating what's about to happen, I think. If the murder came after everything from the last chapter, maybe... but this feels much more organic.

Things are spicing up! Not much happened on the 16th like I thought it would, as implied by the title and Hastings' introduction... but I still think some small part might be relevant to everything on the 17th and beyond. Emily Inglethorp's performance being so close to her death kind of indicates some shift in the family dynamic that has led to the arguments between her and Alfred, as well as her and Mary. Did someone find out something that led to those? We will have to see... but until something happens, everything is circumstantial.

Let's get the family tree out of the way, as there's not much — I only added Dorcas (Emily's servant) and added a new connection between Poirot and Cynthia, who know each other. This implies that Poirot will be able to ask her for more information about her dispensary? Then maybe we will know if something came from there the day before the murder, like what Cynthia did before leaving it with Hastings and Lawrence.

[Timeline of the 16th and 17th](https://preview.redd.it/an9zjc3260vd1.jpg?width=1877&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da9f2d8c01f5942e0b387379d1a7f6804674e93a)

And here's the added parts of the timeline — a LOT, I know. But after the murder happens, I don't think the days will be as jam-packed... I don't know, we'll see. Highlights:

* Mary's time with Bauerstein — which she has told Hastings never happened. Is she lying about that, and does it matter? Until I get an answer, I'll leave that event as uncertain.
* Mary's conversation with Emily. I think I might know what she wants, if my assumption about this murder surrounding *inheritance* turns out to be correct. But I'm not too sure who she thinks Emily is shielding... John, Lawrence, Alfred? That's up to the jury.
* Anything orange is listed as some form of evidence, and Hastings insisting on the tea in Emily's hands having not been drunk — that is clearly going to be important later. I have marked it.

Of course, I do not know how much of this will be relevant... after all, the murder hasn't even happened yet. Once it does, then I'll be able to stop recapping these events and start making deductions! Then, I'll cry as Christie finds ways to subvert my expectations, probably. :/ But in the meantime, I'm looking forward to when everything goes wrong...",0,1729034119.0,agathachristie,0,0.5,False

I've been once a day cup of coffee drinker (\~200mg) for the last 9 years.

I didn't feel like drinking coffee one day and just kept going caffeine free cold turkey. I also dream from time to time that I am in a coffee shop getting a coffee and I wake up with a craving.

The headaches are gone as well as the muscle aches that I have felt during the first few days.

My sleep has improved a lot and I remember my dreams every morning now. The problem I face is with my motivation. I don't feel like doing anything and it takes me forever to get going in the morning.

I wake up at 6AM but I am not fully awake until 10-11 AM. My room is a mess and I just don't feel like cleaning it.

I am also dealing with some mild depression that I do not know how to describe as well as social withdrawal. I do not truly feel myself? And life is a little less enjoyable.

The past 2 days my body really wanted to get a caffeine but I am still refusing to cave in.

I am close to the timeline of 2-9 days of caffeine withdrawal and wondering if it will take longer than this?

I'm happy with it, but there is something strange I have noticed. Probably about 75% of the time, the filter works very slowly and actually won't even process all the water from the top chamber until I've emptied the bottom chamber. The other 25% of the time, it filters more quickly and can filter all the water from the top without coming to a stop. Either way, the water comes out at 0 TDS and tastes fine. Also, the speed remains the same for all the water I filter at a given time (e.g. if I refill the pitcher several times over the course of a few hours) until the next time I need to do it. It's the same tap water going in, and there seems to be no discernable pattern as to when it will work fast or slow.

1g4l8dx,https://i.redd.it/1cgiyvyq50vd1.jpeg,Every Part of this is GOLD,"""If you know Tony Head only from his role on the WB cult hit, ***Buffy the Vampire Slayer***, then you don't know Tony at all. As Giles, Buffy's watcher (the man destined to train and counsel the slayer), he is bookish, bumbling and shy in all romantic matters that transpire between the sexes. You'll generally see him with a book in one hand and a teacup in the other, decked out in layers of wool and tweed with a pair of wire-rimmed glasses perched on his nose.


Off screen, it's a different story. Tony's style leans toward a loose-fitting silk shirt and jacket in muted tones, gold loop earring in one ear and a rakish smile (a far cry from one of his early characters. Frank N' Furter from ***The
Rocky Horror Show***). In conversation, he switches accents as fast as people switch lanes on L.A. freeways and comes up with one-liners almost as quickly.


Tony may look famillar - think instant coffee in the form of those now-famous, soap opera style Taster's Choice ads. The series of commercials gave him his first taste of what it's like to be a sex symbol.


""Initially, I found the character be insufferably smug - I didn't see him having any life at all,"" Tony tells us with a laugh. ""I thought people would stone him in the streets if he didn't get some credibility. My favorite moment was having a conversation with my leading lady in the lift and the doors close in my face. That was the most human moment of all.""


According to Tony, the commercial producers hired him because he had wry smile and a twinkle in his eyes. Those two traits also helped him capture a role in the SciFi series, ***VR5***, in which he played the natty spy Oliver Sampson, a dark and dangerous mystery man. ""A smiling vilain is sexy,"" Tony asserts. ""You're not sure where he's coming from. Oliver had this cool, faceless exterior and there was a riskiness to him. I think that's what made him attractve. When someone seemingly has a lot to hide, it makes him interesting,"" he claims before adding, ""but in real life you met someone with a lot to hide, you'd probably run a mile.""


While an air of mystery may attract women, Tony is clear on what captures his fancy. ""It's the eyes."" he says dreamily. ""And Sarah has the most incredible eyes. They're extraordinary... you just get lost in them.""


Sarah is Tony's lady love and the mother of his two children, Emily Rose and Daisy Mae (ages ten and eight). Tony and his girls share a country home in Bath, England, with horses, dogs and other assorted animals. But with his role on a weekly TV series. Tonry spends most of the year here in the U.S. ""The hardest thing about being away,"" he says, casting his gaze into the distance, ""is talking to Sarah on the phone and knowing she's basically being a single mother. Sometimes we have to remind each other, '*you*
know why I'm here and *I* know why I'm here, and it's a good thing.'""

Sarah isn't ready to be Mrs. Head, Tony reveals, but he's quite happy with things the way they are. ""We've been together for fiften years and we have an exceptional relationship which has stood the test of distance and time and other ravages. Sarah is a remarkable woman.""


Unlike Giles, Tony is a man who appreciates a good hug. ""Giles has a bit of my father in him - a very sweet man but not hugely tactle. Tony offers fondly. ""Personally. I am a tactile person. I'll give anybody a hug... and happily. It's not a sexual thing - I like contact.""


Hugging isn't the only thing Tony enjoys. ""Kissing,"" he says, ""is the most underrated thing. People just assume that's what you do before you get into
the rest of it. But kissing is the most exciting thing. You don't have to be in love with someone to enjoy it. And when it is someone you love, it's the most electric thing. It's an art. You know that feeling sometimes, when your lips are r really sensitive and it's happening for both of you? It's fantastic!""

Of course, not all kisses turn out that well. ""The first kiss for the Taster's Choice commercials was shot in Paris. It was supposed to be set in the spring but it was freezing. You could see the breath coming out of our mouths, so we had to suck ice cubes before we talked to keep our breath from showing. Deeply romantic. When I saw the first cut, there were all these slurping noises going and I said, 'Oh God. you've got to take those out!' But the ad exec loved the slurps. It's funny what turns people on. When people kiss or screen, like it to be - not silent, but at least delicate. Not a three-course meal.""


**Pillow Talk Bedtime Thoughts:** ""They're 
romantic - even when I'm alone. Romance means doing something that touches her soul, something that shows you've thought about her to a great degree.""


**Bedroom Music:** ""Prince has always besr sexy - Beethoven is, too.""


**Sleepwear:** ""Depends on the mood. Certainly not the lingerie I still get from devoted Frank N Furter fans.""


**Most Unusual Bedroom Activity:** ""Hoovering with me sling backs on. I had to practice walking in high heels for Rocky Horror and when me girlfriend caught me vacuuming in her shoes, she was quite astonished. I soon put her mind to rest.""",49,1729033985.0,buffy,6,0.99,False

1g4l70r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g4l70r/aitah_for_breaking_lease_and_possibly_leaving_my/,AITAH for breaking lease and possibly leaving my roommate screwed?,"I (31F) and my partner (25M) have a roommate (26F) who we are breaking lease on.

We gave 7 weeks notice, and the original lease and is 1/31 so it would’ve been 3 1/2 more months of living together - yes, it was more expensive to break lease than to ride it out.

Now for the details - I received word that I lost my job about 3 weeks ago, my last day is 11/26. Ever since we got word, we immediately started tightening our belt and spending less, being as frugal as we can knowing we’ve been unhappy here and would be leaving in January and not knowing if I’d have work by then.

We’ve had ongoing issues with my roommate helping herself to my food - she has always taken things she thought I wouldn’t notice, or “assumed” she could have, would sometimes claimed to think it was hers, or sometimes I’d offer a food I made that day and she’d take an unrelated food item instead (key note to the story). 

I’ve confronted her in the past - but the response has either been:

A. Crying, sometimes with an excuse (“had a bad day”, “I started my period” and “my friends bailed on game night and I just couldn’t” have been some of the excuses).

B. Played it off as nbd and promised to replace it, usually not doing so, or sometimes doing it then eating the replacement. 

C. Outright denied (in the case of coffee, which I brew at home, I have a chemex, she has a French press, they use different grinds so it’s obvious whose coffee is whose, also I label mine now).

So the backstory is this - she tends to act out passive aggressively. For example, she has a chinchilla and she’s bad about picking up its poop. Chinchillas are like rabbits, they just drop poop pellets as they go, and she lets it free roam. I’m fine with that, as long as she cleans up its poop. She often doesn’t or does poorly and we’ll fine poop pellets on the kitchen, bathroom, etc and to the point where some months ago I just asked that the chinchilla not be allowed in those areas. After we asked this, we started finding chinchilla poop in our bedroom in corners, under the bed, under the desk etc. We are in the basement room with a door, so there is really no excuse. 

 We had friends over last week and I made a curry dinner - when she came home, I offered her some. I make more money than her and sometimes offer to feed her - she said thanks and proceeded to instead eat some leftover pizza my boyfriend and I had set aside for lunch the next day. This pizza was not offered, and it was our one splurge this week cus again? I’m losing my job. But most importantly, I’m performing 4 nights a week in addition to full time work still, so preparing meals is important so that I can eat most days of the week as some days span 16 hours of committed time elsewhere.

When I confronted her she burst into tears and offered to buy a new pizza (frozen from Fred Meyer, what she took was a restaurant purchase from a nicer place we all like).

Later that week - I had been doing a 1k piece puzzle on the dining room table in the common area, I had told her I lost my job, I didn’t tell her this was one of the ways I was addressing my stress - I own the table and it’s important to note that all other areas were clean/usable. It’s also important to note that we had a second puzzle in our bedroom but my boyfriend asked I leave that as an “us” thing so I was doing the one on my table. 

I work full time still, and perform 4 days a week in a musical. So, I worked 8-5, left to perform at 5:30 pm and came home around 11, and my puzzle was boxed and left on the table in the box. This didn’t surprise me, again, she tends to have passive aggressive retaliation’s when we address problems. 

So the next day I asked her not to do it again, I stated that it was how I’m trying to manage my stress, and she snapped at me about it being in her way while she was trying to study (she’s a student now, more on that later), I snapped back that she could’ve used the living room, her desk, her bedroom, placed her stuff on top of the puzzle, pushed the puzzle aside, or texted me to ask. All reasonable solutions I felt. We snapped back and forth and she left.

She then sent a lengthy text about us making her feel unsafe and messes in common areas (ironically most of the messes referred to were hers, including dish complaints, etc) and about respecting the communal spaces. I proposed looking at breaking lease as an option, since she doesn’t feel safe around us and we’re unhappy with the space itself, the small issues we’ve had with her regarding food theft, and the more long-standing issues of I paid 60% of the rent for half the lease (5 months of our 10 so far) and my partner had to move in because she was never able to pay her fair expected half of rent - which was the original agreement when we moved in together - we split everything down the middle. I have receipts for this all. Important note - she’s had 5 official jobs in these 10 months, 7 if you count side gigs. She quit both full time job opportunities she’d had, then eventually chose to take out loans and go back to school full time so “couldn’t” pay 50% rent - saddling me with the bulk of the financial responsibility. This doesn’t include my giving her money for things like car tickets, provided all communal supplies, and providing sometimes food outright and utilities. So this was why I was frustrated by this stage and proposed a lease break.

She initially said if we wanted to move out, she stay til the end of the lease and pay the remaining rent - we said yes and started looking. 

She backtracked and said she was “honest surprised” and told me “I think you’re reacting to emotion” etc basically, gaslighting me into backing down. But I’d had it by this point so wasn’t backing down.

The next day, she left a bloodied, water soaked large tattoo bandage in the shower that my partner slipped on that morning when stepping in. This was the day after we got the text about being cleaner and respecting the communal space. When notified her and sent photos of the bandage and stated she left it there, she replied with “haha I had a fever dream I threw that away. I only stained the towel I laid out a little” (a whimsical excuse, which is very her, and a subtle acknowledgment that she also ruined our towel).

We let her know we’d be vacating before December. 

She texted the next day that she “actually only gave 2.5k left of my student loan to live off of until January” which implied that she had not further income. So we asked if she lost her job - if she did we were sorry we didn’t know (she’d gotten a huge tattoo the day before so we figured she still had income). She replied that she has 2 part time jobs and was confused because “we always split rent evenly”

By which point I was fuming mad. I sent the receipts from the property manager. There were times I paid twice what she did in rent, for 5 months.

She got upset, said I was bullying her, that she didn’t know where it was coming from, and that I was putting her in an impossible situation because she makes so much less money than me. To which I pointed out she contained to choose to quit her full time job opportunities which unfairly saddled me with disproportionate financial obligations so we wouldn’t lose our home. She stated she was staying through part of December and “I don’t know what your plans are but”


So we put in our notice. 7 weeks notice, well beyond 30 days. She makes less, yes, and perhaps it did blindsided her, my decision, and she has to figure out housing and the costs associated etc but 


It’s been 10 months of stress, low level financial manipulation, petty theft, and little white lies as well as weird social bullshit I’m not even getting into. Why I’m struggling with whether or not I’m an asshole, is the off chance that this IS a surprise and knowing she can’t get approved for an apartment due to her financial history, terrible employment history etc. She thinks I’m doing this for revenge over a puzzle. 

Also let me note a - she had a full time job when she moved in, quit almost immediately after moving in. Part of her begging (yes she begged me to help) in this situation was how much debt she was in from school, I’d been paying out of pocket for school at the time and had to quit due to financial strain. One of her part time jobs bumped her to full time a few months ago, and she quit within two weeks of being made full time and stated she couldn’t work full time now because she was  going back to school instead. Which she took out MORE loans to do.

I initially started this post as a response to another before it became far far too long of a post to be in the comment section. 

I for my entire life I've struggled with extreme explosive irrational anger after dropping things and only within the past year have I been able to make a change for the better I hope that this post can help other people with the same issue.

...

Hey guys I've really been working on this the past year and while I'm not always able to just shrug off the experience in the moment it's been getting better and better to the point where now I don't think much of it. That is until recently when after moving back to somewhere I used to live I saw how much a loved one struggles with this on a regular basis and I relived how much I used to by seeing it. I'm hoping by sharing my own experiences with this I can help other people with this problem and also at some point hopefully help that person as well when they're in a place to hear advice on it.

Much of this is voice to text as I am also dyslexic and struggle with having to type everything out there will likely be some typos but I will do my best to keep them to a minimum
Also I am realizing this post is way longer than I meant for it to be and will put subcategories to make it easier to navigate 😩

Step 1 finding the root cause:

So first off this and change for me really start with understanding the root of some of my issues with dropping things to begin with so while this can vary for different people I figure sharing my own logic for how I got to be so bad with this can help other people to self evaluate their own likely reasons for why they struggled with this. 

Part 1 Autism:

Personally I have recently learned that I am likely autistic and also have bad proprioception and I'm also prone to autism meltdowns. Due to my difficulty with motor skills I have been clumsy my entire life and therefore have been struggling with minor things like dropping stuff throughout the day my entire life this has led to me building and building a hatred towards these moments because it just seems to keep happening and is out of my control. 
One thing that I have found helped a lot with this is allowing myself to have empathy for myself, recognizing that this is something inherent in my body that I struggle with and that wall I am very physically capable of many things I can struggle at times with motor skills and that that is something I have to accept. 

Part 2 childhood:

Another cause that I found for this or rather likely cause is the way in which people around me reacted to things being dropped while I was growing up and learning right and wrong from those around me
This first dawned on me when I saw a tiktok of a woman raising her kids and she had multiple videos of one of her kids spilling things and dropping things and her reaction to these moments were so intensely different from anything I remembered as a kid when I was a kid if I dropped something I remember people around me getting upset and I also remember witnessing other people in my life in my family dropping things and getting unreasonably angry and response as well so likely part of this behavior is from learning it from others and therefore repeating it myself as well as when I drop something getting annoyed because I knew other people would be upset or annoyed or mad because of that action. In the video this mother would show her kid drop something or spill something and her response was always oopsies or no response at all just uh oh you know just a little like oh okay that's that's no biggie and I literally started bawling my eyes out so if you haven't seen a video like that but you watch a video like that and you have a similar response that could be a root of it.

Step 2 coping mechanism:

One of the interesting things about the human brain is that when you have a pathway form in your brain the more that pathway is utilized the stronger that pathway becomes. I personally love the visualization of imagining your brain as a deep dense forest at some point you walked from point a in the forest to point b in the forest to get from point a to point b you had to form a path maybe you slice through the path with machete maybe you slowly walked carefully winding through the woods maybe you found a field and walk through the field no matter what you made a path the more and more traveled the path became the more worn it was. So for instance if you have an action that is repeated over and over and over again that pathway May resemble a paved roadway or a black paved path through the woods versus a pathway that is only sometimes traveled maybe a dirt path maybe with some Vines growing across it and a pathway that is never traveled me just be dense brush. 

That all to say the pathway from I dropped something to I get really mad is likely to be pretty damn paved at this point if you're an adult so the difficult part is trying to no longer walk that path so as to let the cracks start forming in the pavement trees to start growing through the path Vines to grow across and it all to go back to dense forest while at the same time walking New paths over and over and over again so as to form new ones that are easily accessible and eventually paved themselves. This visualization wallets a bit dramatic has been very helpful for me as a sort of meditation in these moments allowing me to visualize since I'm a very visual thinker and kinesthetic learner and therefore visualizing and then moving through this New path really helps me in these moments.

So that brings us to how in the heck do I start making a new path. 

Part 1 surrender/removal

So when it comes to surrender I put this into two categories one is the Fish flop and the other is deep breaths
But I first started doing the very first step that I started doing was anytime every time that I was at all capable of it when I dropped something my first step was always to fucking take a breath and it is so insanely simple but it does so much and it is so God damn hard when you are not used to it it's so easy to say oh you drop something deep breath before you do anything else yeah it's not that simple but the more that you can practice doing that the more that you will be able to improve it.
So every time moving forward that you drop something take a moment and take one deep breath maybe as you exhale that breath you sigh loudly and you just shake your shoulders right it sounds really stupid sounds really silly I know but it will help. Maybe one breath is not enough in some moments and taking five deep breaths will help right take as much time as you need you can even walk out of the room which falls more into the removal category right say for instance taking a deep breath while standing there looking at the mess that you just made by dropping something on the ground is too much for you take a deep breath as you walk out of the room you don't have to look at it anymore if you have bad object permanence like me you might even forget about it for a moment right. 

The second concept the fish flop like to call it because I think it is funny sounding that way is really deep into the surrender category or if you think about it differently really deep into the removal category but more in the mental removal from the situation and this is in that moment when you drop something just laying or sitting on the ground. 
You might feel really stupid doing it especially depending on where you are and who is around you and some cases it might not be right to do this move say for instance if you're in public it might not feel safe or socially acceptable to do but if you are in the comfort of your own home or if the breathing alone does not seem to help surrender into it oh you just dropped a spoon and now you have to go get another one sit down and breathe lay down and breathe and I mean full body deep breathing for just a couple moments. You can even do this wall also removing yourself in the situation right so you drop something in one room you take a deep breath as you walk out of the room and just flop onto the floor maybe the cozy carpet in the living room right or onto a cozy bed or a cozy couch and you just breathe.

Taking a second to calm yourself before addressing the situation really helps

I find specially because the pathway is so strong at the beginning that initial disruption is the hardest part but also can be the most simple step right so taking a deep breath removing yourself in the situation releasing the tension your body and just flopping to the floor surrendering into the moment gives you a break in the known pattern it is uninterrupted interrupts that initial gut stink reaction of anger rising.

Part 2 healthy release of energy 

So one of the next stages which I personally found I had to build to because it was very hard for me to do naturally is a healthy release of energy. Emotions are stored in the body if you hold emotions in they will come to harm you in some other way whether it is future emotional issues or physical sometimes even just tension health in certain muscle groups of the body due to not releasing your emotions correctly

in these moments it is important to LOCATE the emotion FEEL the emotion RELEASE the emotion

So this category is focusing on that release of emotion in these moments you're likely feeling upset frustrated annoyed angry the unhealthy way of releasing that energy is throwing that little tantrum which is the known pathway finding a healthy release of that same emotion is going to be key in long-term ability to sustain this change 

One of my personal favorite ways to handle this is with what I call ""Funny Anger"". I tend to be a bit of a cross and sarcastic person at times and in these moments especially I find that that is the next closest thing to anger that I can express but it is a little bit less bad for me so what I find really helped was after I had that deep breath being dramatically angry but in a way that was pushing comedy 
So if I was going to give an example of this I'd say I dropped a spoon into the sink and hit a bowl of soapy but also grimy water that was sitting in the sink and it splashed on me onto the counter onto the surface around me and I'm annoyed cuz I dropped that spoon and I was washing the spoon and I'm pissed off now here's how I would Express that moment with funny anger. It would change each time slightly it wasn't some specific line that I would say or something though you could also do that like a mantra of sorts if that's easier but I would maybe I drop that spoon in instead of shouting truly angry I would go oh my God the world is ending oh it's horrible I dropped a spoon into the sink this is the worst thing that could have ever happened to me oh my God and I throw my hands up in the air and I would say it with this vibrato and this drama and maybe I can fall to the ground kneeling and then I'd like go oh my God and I just hold my head in my hands now that's absurd I wouldn't really do that around other people but if I was by myself I might do something along those lines.

Finding some way to make that anger comical made it easier for me to accept those moments and when I would do this normally by the end of it it was so silly and dramatic that I would start laughing at myself because it was so absurd. And I personally have a dog who is sensitive to sounds and shouting and anger she gets very concerned if I'm upset so if I was alone meaning not with other people I was often with her so I would do these things more so at her goofily and she'd come over wiggling like saying what I'm doing and it would just be a funny moment instead of me shouting cuz I drop something in her looking terrifying I would be able to make it something that lifted my spirits. 

Now I understand that that method is not for everyone it wasn't even always for me sometimes I could not do then I just opted for a deep breath and then quietly angrily cleaning up the stuff but not shouting which was improvement enough so instead of that kind of release of energy you could also do a physical release of energy 

I find that anger can be very physical emotion it's very intense in my muscles and I can feel the way that anger tenses my muscles so movement is a great way to release that energy right that tightness in the muscles becomes something strong or flowy is the easiest way I can explain it 
An example of a strong release would be say for instance you drop something you feel angry you start jogging in place and punching the air right but you're not shouting it's a different pathway it might not be the best pathway but you're starting to form different ones right the more different pathways you start forming the easier it is to break that initial one 
Or say for instance you need more of a flowy one and this one can also be kind of silly too if you play it that way you drop something and you just start breaking into dance or breaking into dance and song really go over the top with it and just find movement really truly any kind of movement you can take a lap around the house it does not matter any kind of movement could help in this situation to release that energy if you're in a situation where you can go for a quick run a quick bike ride a quick jumping on a trampoline I don't know jump rope something that could be your outlet try to find something that works for you as a release

It is important with a release of energy to get timing right so it release of energy should either be right before cleaning up the mess or right after cleaning up the mess so for instance if you dropped something that's glass and there's pets in your house it's not safe to leave the room and go for a run outside if those pets aren't confined to a different part of the house because it wouldn't be safe for them or right to do to them if they were to come in there and step on it so you might need to just take some deep breaths quietly clean up the mess and then go for a run or you could put your dog into a crate and then go for a run but ideally that release energy would take place before having to clean up that mess say for instance you just drop something nothing broke nothing is hazardous it's not important really that you clean up in that exact moment if there is even a mess to clean up in that moment go for that run go for that bike ride jog in place for a while until that is released you can even punch a pillow or a punching bag if you have it anything and then go clean up the mess when you're in higher spirits when you have those endorphins pumping through your veins

Part 3 Inner child work, meditation, self love

Now this category is kind of broad which I thought would make it longer than other ones but clearly I can talk for way longer than I thought about this 🫠

Inner child work could be a positive way to reform this pathway specifically if your childhood was filled with people reacting to these situations in an unhealthy way right reenacting the way in which that tiktoker that I described earlier reacted to her kids you drop something you go oopsies oh my goodness did you spill something and you can even say it in the kind of voice that you would use for a child or a dog treating yourself as if you are a child in your own home and healing those past moments in the process 

Meditation could be in that moment or in a future moment say for instance you dropped something in that moment you might take 5 minutes breathing meditating saying in mantra to yourself talking to yourself through it this is not that big of a deal it's only going to take me two seconds to really clean this up yes it's upsetting that it just happened and I wish that I wasn't so clumsy that I did these things but my hands and my body allow me to do so many wonderful things of course there's times that I'm not perfect of course there's times that I'm not able to not drop things especially given my difficult motor skill problems or specially given the fact that this bowl was slippery when I was washing it of course I dropped in it broke that's okay now let's just breathe through this moment and if you okay in this moment and accept myself in this moment. 

Part 4 Being around the right people 

Now one thing that I was lucky about is that I was able to do these changes in the setting that I was in I was around other people who did not have a hard time when they dropped things and I could watch the way that they were with those things I was around people who were not going to be upset with me at least most of the time depending on what I dropped potentially if it was something really important no one's perfect but overall if I drop something something broke anything like that they were the kind of people who would not overreact and negative way or be over the top about it and that allowed me to go through this transitional phase 

One thing that would be important to think about and consider for yourself during this time of trying to rewire this pathway is how other people around you act and react now if they don't personally have the most healthy ways to react to things it can be very easy for those instances and witnessing those instances to rub off on you and make it harder for you to make a change 
maybe if you are lucky they're the kind of people who would be receptive to also going through a change with you the hey I want to do this about myself will you be my buddy for it approach might work for some people but they also might not be and if that's the case thinking about a plan of how you're going to handle when they're having an overreaction or how you can separate yourself from them might be important 

On the other side of the coin there are the people who will overreact at you if you are living with or spending an extended period of time with people who overreact because you drop something please understand that that is not a normal reaction if you drop something no one should be yelling at you no one should be shouting at you no which would be disappointedly shaking their head at you or cursing or anything like that that is not a healthy normal reaction even if it is what you are used to that does not make it normal or healthy 
For some people you may be able to separate yourself from those people for other people you may not be able to find space or separation from those people I personally don't have much experience with this and can't speak on the issue much but it is something that you may want to think through and consider how you're going to handle those situations most likely if they're the kind of person who reacts in that way you cannot have a healthy constructive conversation with them about their future actions but maybe if there was someone who has issues with rage but is seeing a therapist or something like that there is a way in which you could talk them about it and best of luck to you if you are dealing with that

Part 5 reflection 

Now this is more of a post reaction stage and it is that moment of self-reflection after a moment so say for instance you drop something you managed to take a deep breath you managed to calm yourself in some way and clean it up or mediate the situation well pausing and having a moment of self-reflection congratulating yourself on that it's very important 
Take a moment pat yourself on the back and tell yourself that you did a good job even if it feels silly even if makes you feel kind of stupid that moment can make a big difference in the long run because it's self rewarding that response making that pathway grow a little bit more because it felt good maybe you even had a reward system if you manage to drop something and then respond to it well you get a piece of candy you get a lollipop you get to buy something that's under $5 that you really wanted but you were just not buying right then maybe you got to go get yourself a coffee something enjoyable maybe you get to watch 5 minute video of something funny right something to reward yourself for that reaction 

now on the other side of that say for instance you had a moment where you had this over the top dramatic reaction you were too tired that day too hungry that day too exhausted for some reason you were not able to do your best in that situation or maybe it wasn't necessarily a bad day but you're just still early on in the process and it's really hard to change your brain so you blundered a little bit and you did a bad job at your reaction and you feel embarrassed you feel upset you feel silly especially say someone else saw you with that reaction and now you feel foolish 
In that moment having a little meditative self-reflection or maybe sometime a while after the moment when you've calmed down enough reflect on the moment look at ways that you could have gone about it differently maybe you could have done something different before you even drop the thing to get yourself in the right headspace say for instance you were running around frantic in a rush and that's why you dropped something maybe you need to start thinking of ways that you can change that frantic energy that you're having before you even dropped the items maybe you need to start being able to recognize those moments, sometimes it's hard recognize those moments before the issue happens but afterwards you should be able to self reflect to a certain extent and even if the next time you do the same thing the next time you do the same thing and the next time you do the same thing eventually if you keep on self-refing on those moments and in your head thinking I get to frantic and then I drop things I get too anxious and then I drop things I don't eat enough breakfast I don't give myself enough fuel I don't get hydrated enough I don't get enough sleep and then I do this and then I get too upset and I can't handle it recognizing those issues and starting to do little microscopic changes will eventually start diminishing the number of instances and the intensity that you're feeling and having in those instances 

Another thing to consider it in these self-reflective moments is self compassion not just how could I've done some things differently but telling yourself it's okay that you're still learning we are all here for the first time in our memory we don't have another life of experiences that we can access we don't know everything there is to know in life we don't know how to handle everything it's okay to not do the right thing the first time even the second time if it's new to you it's hard to do and growing your own self compassion more and more will make the whole process of changing easier

Stage 3 practice 

Lastly I know that this somehow ended up being its own book but if you got away here likely you're very committed to making this change like I was and I want you to know that it is doable it is a pain in the ass but it is doable and sadly it's going to take long time so practice everyday practice every time it happens practice every moment you're able it might be hard at times there might be some days where you don't have the capacity to deal with any of it and just fall into the old patterns and that's okay but the next day is a new day you wake up and you practice again getting yourself in the right mindset and having the goal to practice this everyday so that you can slowly make this change will be key 

I'm sorry for the Post being so insanely long but I do hope it genuinely helps someone out there I hope other people can share their experiences and I hope to hear from people who either have already made that change or are working on it as well

How to not be a rationally angry after dropping things!,"I initially started this post as a response to another before it became far far too long of a post to be in the comment section. 

I for my entire life I've struggled with extreme explosive irrational anger after dropping things and only within the past year have I been able to make a change for the better I hope that this post can help other people with the same issue.

...

Hey guys I've really been working on this the past year and while I'm not always able to just shrug off the experience in the moment it's been getting better and better to the point where now I don't think much of it. That is until recently when after moving back to somewhere I used to live I saw how much a loved one struggles with this on a regular basis and I relived how much I used to by seeing it. I'm hoping by sharing my own experiences with this I can help other people with this problem and also at some point hopefully help that person as well when they're in a place to hear advice on it.

Much of this is voice to text as I am also dyslexic and struggle with having to type everything out there will likely be some typos but I will do my best to keep them to a minimum
Also I am realizing this post is way longer than I meant for it to be and will put subcategories to make it easier to navigate 😩

Step 1 finding the root cause:

So first off this and change for me really start with understanding the root of some of my issues with dropping things to begin with so while this can vary for different people I figure sharing my own logic for how I got to be so bad with this can help other people to self evaluate their own likely reasons for why they struggled with this. 

Part 1 Autism:

Personally I have recently learned that I am likely autistic and also have bad proprioception and I'm also prone to autism meltdowns. Due to my difficulty with motor skills I have been clumsy my entire life and therefore have been struggling with minor things like dropping stuff throughout the day my entire life this has led to me building and building a hatred towards these moments because it just seems to keep happening and is out of my control. 
One thing that I have found helped a lot with this is allowing myself to have empathy for myself, recognizing that this is something inherent in my body that I struggle with and that wall I am very physically capable of many things I can struggle at times with motor skills and that that is something I have to accept. 

Part 2 childhood:

Another cause that I found for this or rather likely cause is the way in which people around me reacted to things being dropped while I was growing up and learning right and wrong from those around me
This first dawned on me when I saw a tiktok of a woman raising her kids and she had multiple videos of one of her kids spilling things and dropping things and her reaction to these moments were so intensely different from anything I remembered as a kid when I was a kid if I dropped something I remember people around me getting upset and I also remember witnessing other people in my life in my family dropping things and getting unreasonably angry and response as well so likely part of this behavior is from learning it from others and therefore repeating it myself as well as when I drop something getting annoyed because I knew other people would be upset or annoyed or mad because of that action. In the video this mother would show her kid drop something or spill something and her response was always oopsies or no response at all just uh oh you know just a little like oh okay that's that's no biggie and I literally started bawling my eyes out so if you haven't seen a video like that but you watch a video like that and you have a similar response that could be a root of it.

Step 2 coping mechanism:

One of the interesting things about the human brain is that when you have a pathway form in your brain the more that pathway is utilized the stronger that pathway becomes. I personally love the visualization of imagining your brain as a deep dense forest at some point you walked from point a in the forest to point b in the forest to get from point a to point b you had to form a path maybe you slice through the path with machete maybe you slowly walked carefully winding through the woods maybe you found a field and walk through the field no matter what you made a path the more and more traveled the path became the more worn it was. So for instance if you have an action that is repeated over and over and over again that pathway May resemble a paved roadway or a black paved path through the woods versus a pathway that is only sometimes traveled maybe a dirt path maybe with some Vines growing across it and a pathway that is never traveled me just be dense brush. 

That all to say the pathway from I dropped something to I get really mad is likely to be pretty damn paved at this point if you're an adult so the difficult part is trying to no longer walk that path so as to let the cracks start forming in the pavement trees to start growing through the path Vines to grow across and it all to go back to dense forest while at the same time walking New paths over and over and over again so as to form new ones that are easily accessible and eventually paved themselves. This visualization wallets a bit dramatic has been very helpful for me as a sort of meditation in these moments allowing me to visualize since I'm a very visual thinker and kinesthetic learner and therefore visualizing and then moving through this New path really helps me in these moments.

So that brings us to how in the heck do I start making a new path. 

Part 1 surrender/removal

So when it comes to surrender I put this into two categories one is the Fish flop and the other is deep breaths
But I first started doing the very first step that I started doing was anytime every time that I was at all capable of it when I dropped something my first step was always to fucking take a breath and it is so insanely simple but it does so much and it is so God damn hard when you are not used to it it's so easy to say oh you drop something deep breath before you do anything else yeah it's not that simple but the more that you can practice doing that the more that you will be able to improve it.
So every time moving forward that you drop something take a moment and take one deep breath maybe as you exhale that breath you sigh loudly and you just shake your shoulders right it sounds really stupid sounds really silly I know but it will help. Maybe one breath is not enough in some moments and taking five deep breaths will help right take as much time as you need you can even walk out of the room which falls more into the removal category right say for instance taking a deep breath while standing there looking at the mess that you just made by dropping something on the ground is too much for you take a deep breath as you walk out of the room you don't have to look at it anymore if you have bad object permanence like me you might even forget about it for a moment right. 

The second concept the fish flop like to call it because I think it is funny sounding that way is really deep into the surrender category or if you think about it differently really deep into the removal category but more in the mental removal from the situation and this is in that moment when you drop something just laying or sitting on the ground. 
You might feel really stupid doing it especially depending on where you are and who is around you and some cases it might not be right to do this move say for instance if you're in public it might not feel safe or socially acceptable to do but if you are in the comfort of your own home or if the breathing alone does not seem to help surrender into it oh you just dropped a spoon and now you have to go get another one sit down and breathe lay down and breathe and I mean full body deep breathing for just a couple moments. You can even do this wall also removing yourself in the situation right so you drop something in one room you take a deep breath as you walk out of the room and just flop onto the floor maybe the cozy carpet in the living room right or onto a cozy bed or a cozy couch and you just breathe.

Taking a second to calm yourself before addressing the situation really helps

I find specially because the pathway is so strong at the beginning that initial disruption is the hardest part but also can be the most simple step right so taking a deep breath removing yourself in the situation releasing the tension your body and just flopping to the floor surrendering into the moment gives you a break in the known pattern it is uninterrupted interrupts that initial gut stink reaction of anger rising.

Part 2 healthy release of energy 

So one of the next stages which I personally found I had to build to because it was very hard for me to do naturally is a healthy release of energy. Emotions are stored in the body if you hold emotions in they will come to harm you in some other way whether it is future emotional issues or physical sometimes even just tension health in certain muscle groups of the body due to not releasing your emotions correctly

in these moments it is important to LOCATE the emotion FEEL the emotion RELEASE the emotion

It would change each time slightly it wasn't some specific line that I would say or something though you could also do that like a mantra of sorts if that's easier but I would maybe I drop that spoon in instead of shouting truly angry I would go oh my God the world is ending oh it's horrible I dropped a spoon into the sink this is the worst thing that could have ever happened to me oh my God and I throw my hands up in the air and I would say it with this vibrato and this drama and maybe I can fall to the ground kneeling and then I'd like go oh my God and I just hold my head in my hands now that's absurd I wouldn't really do that around other people but if I was by myself I might do something along those lines.

Finding some way to make that anger comical made it easier for me to accept those moments and when I would do this normally by the end of it it was so silly and dramatic that I would start laughing at myself because it was so absurd. And I personally have a dog who is sensitive to sounds and shouting and anger she gets very concerned if I'm upset so if I was alone meaning not with other people I was often with her so I would do these things more so at her goofily and she'd come over wiggling like saying what I'm doing and it would just be a funny moment instead of me shouting cuz I drop something in her looking terrifying I would be able to make it something that lifted my spirits.

Part 3 Inner child work, meditation, self love

Now this category is kind of broad which I thought would make it longer than other ones but clearly I can talk for way longer than I thought about this 🫠

Inner child work could be a positive way to reform this pathway specifically if your childhood was filled with people reacting to these situations in an unhealthy way right reenacting the way in which that tiktoker that I described earlier reacted to her kids you drop something you go oopsies oh my goodness did you spill something and you can even say it in the kind of voice that you would use for a child or a dog treating yourself as if you are a child in your own home and healing those past moments in the process

Part 4 Being around the right people 

Now one thing that I was lucky about is that I was able to do these changes in the setting that I was in I was around other people who did not have a hard time when they dropped things and I could watch the way that they were with those things I was around people who were not going to be upset with me at least most of the time depending on what I dropped potentially if it was something really important no one's perfect but overall if I drop something something broke anything like that they were the kind of people who would not overreact and negative way or be over the top about it and that allowed me to go through this transitional phase 

One thing that would be important to think about and consider for yourself during this time of trying to rewire this pathway is how other people around you act and react now if they don't personally have the most healthy ways to react to things it can be very easy for those instances and witnessing those instances to rub off on you and make it harder for you to make a change 
maybe if you are lucky they're the kind of people who would be receptive to also going through a change with you the hey I want to do this about myself will you be my buddy for it approach might work for some people but they also might not be and if that's the case thinking about a plan of how you're going to handle when they're having an overreaction or how you can separate yourself from them might be important 

On the other side of the coin there are the people who will overreact at you if you are living with or spending an extended period of time with people who overreact because you drop something please understand that that is not a normal reaction if you drop something no one should be yelling at you no one should be shouting at you no which would be disappointedly shaking their head at you or cursing or anything like that that is not a healthy normal reaction even if it is what you are used to that does not make it normal or healthy 
For some people you may be able to separate yourself from those people for other people you may not be able to find space or separation from those people I personally don't have much experience with this and can't speak on the issue much but it is something that you may want to think through and consider how you're going to handle those situations most likely if they're the kind of person who reacts in that way you cannot have a healthy constructive conversation with them about their future actions but maybe if there was someone who has issues with rage but is seeing a therapist or something like that there is a way in which you could talk them about it and best of luck to you if you are dealing with that

Part 5 reflection 

Now this is more of a post reaction stage and it is that moment of self-reflection after a moment so say for instance you drop something you managed to take a deep breath you managed to calm yourself in some way and clean it up or mediate the situation well pausing and having a moment of self-reflection congratulating yourself on that it's very important 
Take a moment pat yourself on the back and tell yourself that you did a good job even if it feels silly even if makes you feel kind of stupid that moment can make a big difference in the long run because it's self rewarding that response making that pathway grow a little bit more because it felt good maybe you even had a reward system if you manage to drop something and then respond to it well you get a piece of candy you get a lollipop you get to buy something that's under $5 that you really wanted but you were just not buying right then maybe you got to go get yourself a coffee something enjoyable maybe you get to watch 5 minute video of something funny right something to reward yourself for that reaction 

now on the other side of that say for instance you had a moment where you had this over the top dramatic reaction you were too tired that day too hungry that day too exhausted for some reason you were not able to do your best in that situation or maybe it wasn't necessarily a bad day but you're just still early on in the process and it's really hard to change your brain so you blundered a little bit and you did a bad job at your reaction and you feel embarrassed you feel upset you feel silly especially say someone else saw you with that reaction and now you feel foolish 
In that moment having a little meditative self-reflection or maybe sometime a while after the moment when you've calmed down enough reflect on the moment look at ways that you could have gone about it differently maybe you could have done something different before you even drop the thing to get yourself in the right headspace say for instance you were running around frantic in a rush and that's why you dropped something maybe you need to start thinking of ways that you can change that frantic energy that you're having before you even dropped the items maybe you need to start being able to recognize those moments, sometimes it's hard recognize those moments before the issue happens but afterwards you should be able to self reflect to a certain extent and even if the next time you do the same thing the next time you do the same thing and the next time you do the same thing eventually if you keep on self-refing on those moments and in your head thinking I get to frantic and then I drop things I get too anxious and then I drop things I don't eat enough breakfast I don't give myself enough fuel I don't get hydrated enough I don't get enough sleep and then I do this and then I get too upset and I can't handle it recognizing those issues and starting to do little microscopic changes will eventually start diminishing the number of instances and the intensity that you're feeling and having in those instances 

Another thing to consider it in these self-reflective moments is self compassion not just how could I've done some things differently but telling yourself it's okay that you're still learning we are all here for the first time in our memory we don't have another life of experiences that we can access we don't know everything there is to know in life we don't know how to handle everything it's okay to not do the right thing the first time even the second time if it's new to you it's hard to do and growing your own self compassion more and more will make the whole process of changing easier

Stage 3 practice 

Lastly I know that this somehow ended up being its own book but if you got away here likely you're very committed to making this change like I was and I want you to know that it is doable it is a pain in the ass but it is doable and sadly it's going to take long time so practice everyday practice every time it happens practice every moment you're able it might be hard at times there might be some days where you don't have the capacity to deal with any of it and just fall into the old patterns and that's okay but the next day is a new day you wake up and you practice again getting yourself in the right mindset and having the goal to practice this everyday so that you can slowly make this change will be key 

I'm sorry for the Post being so insanely long but I do hope it genuinely helps someone out there I hope other people can share their experiences and I hope to hear from people who either have already made that change or are working on it as well 

And with much love best of luck 🥰",2,1729033667.0,selfhelp,0,1.0,False

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[NEWS]  Semirara plans ₱291B expansion of its coal mining operations...** **Semirara Mining and Power** [SCC 34.00 ▼0.7%; 344% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=e305bf5cc0e42910abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] confirmed a report that it was planning to spend approximately ₱291 billion (~$5.07 billion) over a five-year span to run both of its existing coal pits (Molave and Narra) at the same time, then to run the new Acacia pit when the Molave and Narra pits are depleted. The Molave pit reached its end-of-mine life in November 2023. SCC expects the Narra pit to reach its end-of-mine life in 2026. The expansion project will be undertaken until 2027. SCC plans to mine its new Acacia pit once the (expanded) Molave and Narra pits have been fully monetized. The company has submitted its documents to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.
>    - ***MB:*** SCC says all the right things when it talks about how the expansion will support the local economy through the added employment, infrastructure development, and economic activity, but the truth of the matter is that coal is still in demand because it takes time to build energy generation facilities, and our country’s coal power plants are still relied on to produce “baseload” power that “naked” renewable energy facilities (without attached battery builds) cannot. Yes, coal is dirty. Yes, coal kills. Yes, this new Acacia pit is going to be “open pit” just like the Molave and the Narra, which is one of the most dangerous for workers and the environment (both land and sea). But the reality of the grid is that coal is still needed to get us through the day. Even if our grid didn’t need a single metric ton of coal, I imagine SCC would still push through with the expansion to sell its coal on the open market. Sure the price is a lot lower than it was during that crazy pump, but money is money, and SCC makes a lot of it. This expansion could help extend the life of this coal party for SCC and its shareholders.

>- **[UPDATE]  CTS still has not disbursed 56% of its 2022 IPO...** According to its quarterly Disbursement of Proceeds and Progress report, **CTS Global** [CTS 0.71 ▼4.0%; 5% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=66716ac9c363f70babca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] has over ₱780 million in undisbursed proceeds from its April 2022 IPO that raised ₱1.375 billion. The company has not disbursed a material amount of its IPO proceeds since its January 2023 progress report. The stock is down 7.5% over the past year, down 1.3% year-to-date, and down 26% from its IPO price of ₱1.00/share. It declared ₱0.00264/share in regular and special dividends this year out of its FY23 unrestricted retained earnings, at a yield of 0.4% at CTS’s market price at the time of the declaration. The stock is up 23% since the middle of June.
>    - ***MB:*** Is CTS still just squatting on government bonds to wait out the volatility of these tough markets, or is it putting the money given to it by IPO buyers to use and trading the PSE and international markets? All we know for sure is that it still has more than 56% of the money that it took from investors just sitting there in low yield government bonds. Technically, that’s trading. It’s not the kind of trading that CTS used to sell its IPO, but in a world with rapid interest rate changes, playing government bonds is at least a strategy. But when will CTS ever pivot away from this strategy? They’ve missed the entirety of the magical DOW bull run, the early stages of the PSEi bull run, and they seem to have missed the commodities bull run in gold and other precious metals. If I were a shareholder, I’d be screaming for some direction and guidance from the management team.

>- **[QUESTION]  Why do you care if shares sold are primary or secondary?...** 

>  Because it helps me follow the money! Long-time readers know how important the distinction between primary and secondary shares can be for something like an IPO or a strategic investment, but for new readers or for those who are new to investing and reading financial disclosures maybe a little explanation is in order.

>  - **“Primary” definition:** Primary shares are “new” shares that are issued by the company out of its authorized capital stock. The money paid by investors for primary shares will go to the company. A primary share sale increases the company’s outstanding shares.

>  - **“Secondary” definition:** Secondary shares are “used” shares that are held by an investor. The money paid by investors for secondary shares will go to the shareholder(s) selling the shares, not to the company. A secondary share sale doesn’t change the company’s outstanding shares.

>  - **Cash-out vs cash-in:** A primary sale (generally) monetizes the company’s valuation to raise more cash that the company can use. New cash comes into the company that it can put toward paying down debt, building new facilities, or launching new products. A secondary sale (generally) is just a market transaction that doesn’t alter the company’s business in any way. A secondary sale might alter the governance of a company by changing the configuration of the company’s board of directors, but it doesn’t have any impact on the company’s financial statements.

>  - **So why is primary so good?** In an IPO, I use the sale of primary shares as a signal of potential growth. If the company is selling a large portion (>25%) of secondary shares it makes me question the future growth potential of the company if existing shareholders are so willing to exit at this price. Of course, we cannot enter into the minds of those selling shareholders to know their true motivations for selling, but I don’t give selling shareholders the benefit of the doubt. At the end of the day, if I’m taking the enormous risk that comes with buying IPO shares, I want to know that my money will be put to work to make more money for me and my fellow shareholders in the future. I’m not usually interested in providing a parent company with an easy exit or buying an oligarch another supercar as one might in a secondary sale.

>  - **Is this a hard rule?** No, of course not. In the REIT space, for example, there may be valid reasons (time/cost) for a parent company to sell secondary shares of a REIT to increase the public float rather than conducting a public follow-on offering. It’s also quite common for the over-allotment option in an IPO to be made up of secondary shares being sold by one or more of the IPO’s existing owners, but this amount rarely exceeds 10% of the offering and is done so often that it’s honestly hard to draw much (if any) signal from it. For my money, there’s more “signal’ to be drawn from the over-allotment option being primary as well, like we saw with the **Alternergy** [ALTER] IPO.

>    - ***MB:*** The primary/secondary thing is not a debate like whether halo-halo should come with pinipig (it shouldn’t and deep down you know it), or whether you should call a cat by saying “swswswswsw” or “pspspspsps” (it’s neither: you click your tongue three times and yell: “MEOW MEOW!” in a gratingly annoying tone). There’s not a group of Secondary Stans out there waiting to pounce on anyone still laughing at the 33% secondary **Medilines Distributors** [MEDIC] offering. You won’t win friends and influence people by knowing this difference, but I think it is important to understand in order to get a better idea about what a transaction is ‘saying”. Are the owners going all-in alongside the new buyers, or are they offloading bags onto a new bunch of suckers? Does the company have the ability to turn new cash into greater earnings, or is the management team out of ideas and the market already too saturated for new money to boost profits? I use the primary/secondary question as part of a “balance of factors” analysis. It’s one of several things that I look at when evaluating an IPO. It’s not the only thing, and it’s not even the most important. But it’s significant to me, as a long-term investor, as it helps me confirm/validate other parts of the business plan in the prospectus and get an overall feeling for the management team’s ability to grow the business for the benefit of all shareholders.

1g4l0lr,https://www.reddit.com/r/hsp/comments/1g4l0lr/does_anyone_else_feel_overwhelmed_by_constant/,Does anyone else feel overwhelmed by constant noise but struggle to use peaceful moments?," TL;DR below

I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed by the constant noise and activity during the day, and I’m wondering if anyone else can relate. It feels like there’s always something—vacuum cleaners, motorbikes idling in driveways, lawnmowers, construction noise, coffee machines, kettles boiling, or dogs barking—and it leaves me drained. Even when it’s a neighbor’s vacuum or distant noise, I still feel the impact, though not as intensely as when it’s happening right in my own space.

I know I need a lot of sleep to recover from this, but at night, when it’s finally quiet, I feel a sense of peace and sometimes even the motivation to engage in things I enjoy. The problem is, I believe in following a natural circadian rhythm, so I don’t want to become a night owl. I feel that being in sync with the day-night cycle is important for our bodies—especially with how sunlight affects our physiology and how melatonin helps us sleep at night. I really enjoy being outside in nature during the day, far away from people, and don’t want to miss out on that by staying up all night and sleeping through the day.

I just wish the daytime weren’t so noisy and rushed, like everyone’s stuck in a rat race. Has anyone else struggled with this? How do you balance the need for peace and quiet during the day with the necessity of rest at night?


TL;DR: Constant daytime noise exhausts me, but I feel motivated at night when it’s quiet. I want to follow a natural day-night rhythm. Anyone else struggle to find peace and balance rest?",7,1729033369.0,hsp,1,1.0,False

Just recently, I found the courage to introduce myself to her and we immediately hit it off. Good chemistry and it turns out she's also been wanting to introduce herself for a while.

Since then l've encountered her just once more and from those two instances where we talked, l've learned; her name, where she works, where she's from and, obviously, her coffee order.
I'm only missing one thing: her phone number which I was too embarrassed to ask for.

Now, I think this girl is the love of my life and I have no clue when I'm going to see her again.

Therefore, and since l'm a bit delusional, l've come up with a plan. I want to pay a flower shop to deliver a nice bouquet to her workplace with my phone number on it and obviously a note with my name attached to it which I haven't thought about yet.

Just think about it. Isn't this the perfect plan? She's going to have no choice but to text me (this can be either good or bad lol) and once I have her phone number, it's all smooth sailing.

Plus, you can't really get more romantic than that right? Just imagine the ""How I met your mother"" story. I know girls go crazy about romantic stuff like that.

In conclusion, do you think this is a good plan or will she think I’m actually a deranged maniac?

I want to end an affair and come back to the church and be with my family, but my heart is completely broken and I don’t think I have the strength. ","I am 28, and I have been married for 5.5 years. My husband and I share a daughter, who is about to be four. After ten years of wrestling with Catholicism he converted earlier in the year, and, not wanting my family to attend a different church, I converted alongside him as I was essentially Catholic before (we attended a high liturgy Anglican Church). 

I’m going to briefly explain a backstory as context, not an excuse, for the situation I’m now in. I know the Lord can absolve any sin. But I am in a position where I am about to bring horrible pain on many people if I try to seek out reconciliation. I’m looking for people who have come out of seriously screwed up situations like this and who have seen the Lord redeem them, so I can hold onto them while I’m dealing with the fallout of my choices. I also just want to dump all this horrible pain and there isn’t anyone in my life I feel I can lay everything out to because of the affair that no one knows about. 

My husband and I got married right out of college and have been very good partners to each other. We communicate well and I think he is very intelligent and a great father. Essentially right off the bat we did have some trouble with intimacy. We lived in a small apartment with little privacy and I had a lot of struggles with that. We moved states for him to pursue a graduate degree (in a field that he is now not going into) and paid cash for it along the way from my job, so we lived pretty frugal lives. The day Covid lockdown began (it was very strict in the state in which we lived) we found out we were unexpectedly expecting our daughter (NFP method failure) I had HG (hyperemesis) and vomited every single day until my daughter was born. I gained only four pounds and was severely anemic and got 5 cavities. I began to struggle with depression and have had several intensive episodes since her birth. 

Fast forward a few years and the most recent episode occurred in February after I was wrongly accused at my workplace of something very serious. I consulted an attorney who said it was in the top craziest things he had ever heard at a job and advised that I quit. I loved my job and admittedly had allowed it to become part of my identity (it was the one thing, when I was in the throes of depression, that would give me something to get up for) and when I lost it I was completely devastated and crashed into the worst and most horrifying depression of my life. I went to a psychiatric hospital for paranoia (the nature of the accusation had me completely afraid of how I appeared to other people) I took a few months off work and just wallowed in misery. My husband was supportive and kind and basically took on the total care of our daughter and even arranged for us to move cities so I would not have to be around this place where I worked. I cannot tell you the pain I was in from this. It’s still no excuse, but I felt like I was losing my mind, I wanted to die, and I hated everything about my life. This was the point at which my husband converted to Catholicism and I did so as well from despair. 

Then, over the summer, I had to go out of town for a job training. And when I did this, I made the stupidest mistake of my life, and I made a dating profile online and met up with random people for dates during the week I was out of town. I basically just went on walks or got coffee with strangers just to talk to people. I was lonely, and in pain, and I shouldn’t have done it. I used a fake name and didn’t intend for any of them to go beyond a first interaction. 

As you might imagine, I developed feelings for one of these people, and I have been allowing this to go on for four entire months and have been in utter, complete misery. I was a virgin when I got married, I’d never even remotely considered doing anything like this, and suddenly here I am, having an affair with a man who doesn’t even know my name. My husband is so trusting and so good and I love him and I don’t know why I’ve done this but I want to end things—but I am afraid to come clean on either end, because there is going to be so much pain. And the worst part is that I’ve developed feelings for this other person, and despite my love for my husband I’ve now become aware that there were dimensions in our marriage that were missing and I do not know what to do with this knowledge. We talk often and I know ending things will be horribly painful. And since we moved my husband has been so stressed that things haven’t been good in our life (it’s all my fault) and I’m afraid to come crashing down from all this pain with nothing to catch me. I went from never having a speeding ticket to sleeping in another man’s bed. I didn’t even know real people could sin this badly. 

How do I make amends? What do I do? Im so lost and so heartbroken and I am absolutely disgusted with myself. I’m still a new Catholic and I want to be devout. I don’t want to feel this dirty anymore. My husband is a wonderful man and I want to restore our marriage and do right by him. I am afraid and stupid and just need help. Please, especially older Catholics, offer any wisdom you have.

I was responsible for 6 other employees and they all seemed like a very sweet group of ''older'' ladies (age 45-62) and one older man age 53. They were quite knowledgeable in their specialty fields and I felt welcomed and like this would be a great opportunity to learn practical management and a nice springboard for my carreer.

Oh boy was I wrong. 

It all started when they realised I was inexperienced and unfortunately was late to forward some emails (nothing serious, but enough for me to understand their frustration). I apologized and did my best to get better; rewamping my schedule, making automatic notifications, creating daily checklists etc etc. Unbeknown to me, one of the ladies, lets call her Felicia (45F), had applied to the job at the same time as me, but was rejected because she didnt have the needed formal qualifications. This did not sit well with her and she occationally brought it up that she did not understand why she was not picked. She had after all been with the corp 4 months longer than me and had 'experience'.

After only 3 months I started noticing things that gave me a bad feeling, but I could not pin-point what. Things like conversations immediately stopping when I entered the break room, or whenever I joined in on a conversation my thoughts and remarks were dismissed as wrong or just simply overheard or ignored. Someimes I ate my lunch alone, as they seemed in a hurry when I sat down. I am a person that gives people the benefit of the doubt, so I assumed maybe its just transitioning from one manager to another being awkward for them or maybe it was all coincidental. After all, I barely knew them yet and instead I decided a different approach and try get more one-on-one time with each of them. This seemed to have some positive effect, at least while we were by ourselves. I felt like we were having proper conversations and I was finally connecting to them and started enjoying my management role. 

But then other things started to happen. Felicia and Karen(62) were both hired as reseptionists at the front desk, helping customers with access cards, keys, booking meeting rooms etc, while Felicia also had some additional admin duties and lead the team responsible for arranging seminars, business trips, christmas parties etc. I started to notice whenever I walked by, they would close the glass window at the front desk and close the doors. My office was next to theirs and the walls paper thin, so when I sat down by my computer I could clearly hear them talking very negatively about me and sometimes blatantly making up rumors. Then things started to escalate.

I was brought before my boss because there were serious concerns about my leadership, where I was accused of holding back information (this had not happened since the 3 emails i was late to forward) and that I was not being conciderate of the employees, that I did not have appropriate control of their work load, that I did not communicate and so forth. I had no clue what to reply, as neither of these things were true (we had meetings every monday with a set agenda and a ''table talk'' where everyone is expected to bring up issues, concerns or positive things that happens). I told my boss as much, but regardless I was still willing to work on myself should I get a better explanation and some examples of what the team meant by all of this. I never got an answer to either. I brought up the issue of talking behind my back and iffy behaviour, wanting advice from my boss how to handle such before the conflict gets out of hand, but I was only told to continue getting to know them and it would resolve on its own once they trust me. 

It did not get better after this. It went from silent treatment and talking behind my back to yelling at me in front of customers on several occations. Then Felicia and Karen recruited another one from our team, Trudy (51) and started leaving their jobs to talk about me to other departments of the coorp (I know this because  the management of those departments came to me, telling me they had asked the trio to leave as they were wasting the departments time talking rudely about me to the other workers there). At one point they had spent 3 hours talking badly about me to a different department, while they had told me they were out preparing rooms for a big seminar happening later that week.

Again I brought this up to my manager, who had no advice for me and right after our conversation left on a long term sick leave before retirement. The temporary boss made everything worse by enabling what had now become bullying and harassment and instead of helping me handling the conflict, blamed me for how it had turned out and did everything to cover his own back. On the few occations I was bedridden with migrains, I could not even log into Facebook messenger to ask my parents for help to do groceries for me, as the trio from hell would stalk my online status and claim I was not sick if I could be on facebook. 

Eventually, it escalated to a point I got threats from the three employees, saying they would go on collective sick leave and ruin the team as punishment if I made even the smallest mistake again (I still dont know exactly what I did wrong. Even after I asked them directly they had no clear answer). I started losing sleep, I stopped eating and I got nothing done at work because every decision I made, even deciding to print or not to print a document could take me 45 minutes because I didnt know if i should, or if it would be looked upon negatively, I was terrified there would be consequences if I got myself a coffee and so forth. Then Felicia (who had been the herd leader of the trio) staged a security breach and brought it up in a larger meeting, blaming it on me. Luckily, I had physical evidence of not being anywhere near the office when the breach happened, but thats when my doctor, the HSE team and HR told me to go on sick leave immediately, as I was about to collapse by the pressure. In my absence, Felicia and her sheep had finally free reins to do as they please. 

When I slowly came back to work from my sick leave, Felicia was on a power trip from being 'the boss' for a short while. She demanded I give her my management tasks (tasks only I knew how to do as I was the only one with technical insight and thus got a lot of praise for it), dictated how I should do my job and scrutinized every single thing I said and did -both related and unrelated to work. She had put the team upside down, nothing was really under control and where her control ended, she blamed me for the issues she had created in my absence. Yet, she declared herself as a better manager and constantly bothered HR why she just couldnt get the manager position. She loved to tell HR she ''cared deeply'' about my health and it seemed like I was better off in a different, less stressful position, aka, she indirectly asked HR and management to demote me.   
  
However, during my 2 months sick leave, we finally got a new, permanent boss -a real no BS type and this is where I can reveal I had been moving in the shadows all along. Despite a brewing depression, running on 2 hours of sleep a day and a kiwi on the rare occation I ate anything, I was fuming and the lust for revenge was real. During the 1,5 year of harassment, I had documented EVERYTHING and put all my evidence neatly in a 20-some page folder. Each case chronologically. Screenshots, messages, rumors, names, statements from other collegues, dates and time down to minutes. I was THOROUGH. I only needed an opportunity to utilise my weapon. Early on, my boss noticed something being very off with my team and I handed him the folder. To marinate my already juicy beef, I was coincidentally told by the cleaning personell they had seen Felicia work someplace else within a time frame I knew she had registered overtime at our office. Not only that, but on days when she called in sick to our office, she was seen working someplace else. So, I had collected Felicias entire work schedule over the last few months and handed it over to my boss as well. My boss made some calls and well... Apparently, she had been scamming our coorp for at least 50 hours overtime the last couple of months.

While all of this was happening, I was offered a new job at a different coorp with a higher paycheck and a nicer title. My new boss told me to accept it and ''run for the hills'' because when he starts pulling skeletons out of my team's closet, it will not be pretty. So thats what I did. 

Last I heard, Felicia is denied to ever apply for any management job at that coorp and is walking a thin line to even keep her current position. She has been stripped of all responsibility that gave her any relevance or power (practically, she has been demoted even if thats not really a thing in my country). She might face legal consequences if she doesnt pay the coorp back the false overtime. Everyone at the coorp is informed of what she did to me and has since turned their back on her, refusing to get caught up in potential new drama. She is now on long term sick leave and honestly, I dont see how she will ever return to the coorp after all of this.

I was recently diagnosed (yay for being diagnosed at age 30! 🙄) I’ve been prescribed concerta, Vyvanse, and adderall. Each one of those, Vyvanse and adderall in particular, haven’t helped my adhd. In my experience, they ramped up my anxiety which makes it harder for me to focus. The anti anxiety medications I’m prescribed just make me sleepy, not focused whatsoever (adhd makes me sleepy in general, I’m inattentive adhd). Coffee helps but wears off quickly for me, and of course ramps up my anxiety. 

I’ve found that alcohol helps. It calms my mind enough where I can focus on one thing at a time, and not be so overwhelmed and have everything hanging over my head. I love the boost of confidence and assurance that alcohol gives. THC (delta 8) also helps ease my mind enough where I can think clearly and focus on tasks, but if I take too much my mind races. 

What am I supposed to do? ADHD destroys my life, I’m 31 and still trying to figure myself out, and it’s ruined so many friendships and romantic relationships. It’s kept me from being successful in school. But what always seems to help is alcohol and thc. I don’t want to be dependent on these, and I don’t want to have to always self medicate. 

Those of you who struggle similarly, have you found a medication that helps you? I’m open to anything at this point, even self medicating if it is something that is healthy ",2,1729033005.0,adhd_anxiety,0,1.0,False

im complety new to this dating thing so please dont judge my lack of information. 
i come from an arab conservative family to make you understand some of what i am saying.

and also i have a really bad memory so i keep forgetting details even if they were in my favor. 

basically the situation is i liked this girl for a while but we were living in different city
once i moved to her city we started hanging out alot. 
the thing is her life style is so completely different than mine,  her family was not as conservative. 
and she basically got raised as an american even tho she was an arab. 
so you can see some of the conflicts already. 
but i still liked her. 
and we speak openly about our past relationships, mine was mainly online dating and rarely saw them personally,  but hers was normal physical dating. even tho that goes against everything i know,  i was ok with it as it was in the past. 

now i was diagnosed with ADD, Acute anxiety and deep depression, and was not able to feel any emotions for a while,  mainly one of them that i couldnt love a person even if i wanted to, so i was clear with her on that and she said ""the door is open once you are able but i wount stop looking as i want a relationship too"". i thanked her for understanding and we still hanged together and got closer by the day and got in a sort of situationship, to the point we appear to people as if we were married couple, even our friends thought we were actually dating. mean while i was going to therapy to try to over come this emotional obstacle so i can be really hers. 
now i should start to mention that majority of her friends are boys and thats fine,  and a quite good number of them were her bf before or just was a short fling kind of thing,  and that iritates me a little bit to be honest,  but i thought will if she is still single thats her own business. 
she had a new male friend from work,  and they bonded and started hanging out together, i asked her if you like him, or if he likes you let me know so i can step back so you can develop something more promising,  she said no he is just a friend and we cant get married because his family is strict as well, i belived her and said ok. 
since they work together they were spending more time also together and they started to play video games and all during work.
sometime her work allow her to work remotely so they both go to a restaurant and stay there for hours. 
we were in the same friend group so i know the guy and met him multiple times. 
i was still saying that is ok they are working and we are not together yet. 
as days go by and we get closer and therapy started to work actually and i was able to know for sure that i loved her.
and i was sharing all this steps with her but not in full details. 
after a while she kinda went cold on me and said you should get on tinder and don't stop searching. 
i said no i want you. 
she tells me that she started to develop some kind feeling toward someone and it hit me like a truck where i started connecting the dots that multiple times i ask her where are you she responds im with a coworker,  to find out later he was the same guy, there was ni reason to hide his identity from me,  he used to pick her from home to work and buy each other coffee almost daily, and brings her gifts and do alot of stuff for her.
so i literally felt betrayed, and thats the first thing im not sure of if i really have the right to feel betrayed. 

other then that she was mad at one of her ex of a very young age from their teens,  but she decided one day to call him to forgive him, and they become close as well, but they live in a different content. and mentioned that she might be forced to marry him because she have no chance around here. so again i was like ok it was a teen crush and they are far away. 
but he was consistent in her life non the less. 

after i felt betrayed i started to demonise her action and how she was never treating me right always giving priority to something else, staying on her phone while she is with me but takes ages to respond to my messages. and i gave her every thing i got since i came to her city,  and she lied to me about not liking her coworker. 
addinh to that having a constant communication with her ex. 
it all felt really really bad and i was still questioning my self if i had the right to feel that way to begin with.

i got super mad, and i am the kind of persone who gets quite and pull their self away when they get mad. 

you could feel the tension between us for days, she said that she did not know i was trying so allowed here self to develop feelings for someone else.

we had a long discussion as i really want her, i confirmed that the coworker is the guy she started liking, we concluded that since we were not communicating properly by me not really sharing all the details of me working really hard to fix my self for her, and that she saw that there will be no light to their relationship with her coworker so nothing happened. 

i said i love you and she said it back and all was good and i was happy that we were able to sort things out.
i was away for a while not long after our discussion, texting her and all,  she tells me that she got emotionally drained and need a bit of time to come back. i was like sure ok take your time. 
she became bit emotionally dull but i was expecting that and i was full of emotion waiting to come out for the first time in while,  i tried to talk a little but noticed she got annoyed so i gave her space, after i was back i told her that i want to see her, she said she is still recovering and need more time and she needs space from me and all those emotions. 
i was like alright. 

i asked one night what she was doing she told me that she was playing online game with her friends, who are her coworker and two other friends, every night, and on weekends her ex can join them and they all play together, and she told me that i can join if i like to. 

i got pissed,  like really pissed, she asks why am i pissed, i told her that you wanted space from me but i found out that you are playing with the guy who caused our entire issue. 
she saied that she is just dissociating by indulgening in video games so she wount think about her emotions, and told me if you want to join or not i dont care i just wanna play and not think. she tries to forget and i keep reminding her and it wount let her really able to dissociat and that im making her more frustrated. 
i told her will i will not join since it felt like a pity invite, and honestly i dont like your friends. 
she said only the coworker or also someone else. 
i said leave it for later when you are better so we can have a serious discussion.
she said no this will make her more anxious and cant do it, and she wont feel better until she comes back from her vacation. which means a month and half. 

i said i seriously cant wait that long,  and let me be selfish here for a second, what about me? 
she said that i was right and we had another long discussion of how her being away all this time actually affecting me badly, mentally and physically, and that endded in a good term. 
the day after i go back to my place to find her there chilling, she told me that she is still mentally away but came here to rest a bit. 
i was so happy and hugged her but with no hug back as im expecting that she would be cold a bit. we spent the time with silly stuff until she went back home after Hugging me and kissing me. 

the next day same thing happend,  she came and we got closer and more intimate, but i could not help myself noticing 2 things, her ex was calling, and she was wearing a bracelet with her coworker initial next to a heart, as usual i did not confront her and tried to check the bracelet to ask her about it she paniced and hid her hand, not long after Snapchat message from her coworker again. 
she flick it away and closed notification on her phone, i had no idea how to react. 
i asked later on who will she meet during her vacation, she told me she is meeting her ex with bunch of friends. 

there, right there, i knew i needed some help or advice, my father was not that great and my family condition did not allow me to have such experience at young age. 

if you are wondering why i am going through all this trouble for her and want things to work between us, because for the first time in  a very very long time i was truely happy as she brings me joy by just existing in front of me. 

i am aware im not a good story writer and may have missed alot of details plus im typing this right after she told me so not in my greatest shape. 

there is alot of points that can support her dealing with alot of issues mentally and family drama causing her to drain out. 

writing this down sort of helped me recall stuff and see things differently but i would like to hear what you guys think.
