She couldn't wait. Sitting at the edge of her bed with a notebook and pencil, she finally brought her ideas to life. Should it look like a circus tent? Would that be practical? Maybe there should be a ball pit inside. There should definitely be trampolines.

Exterior:

The building is two stories tall, rectangular, and the red tiled roof curves like a circus tent. The stucco walls are painted in red and white stripes. Unlike a normal circus tent, there are small square windows spaced evenly around the sides. The two on either side of the door have red window boxes filled with tulips. The door is painted white, and fitted with a bronze lion head knocker. The doorknob resembles a red clown nose.

Interior:

The door opens into a common room. The floor is smooth, white wood, and the walls are lined with painted portraits of clowns in fancy frames. To the left are three sofas. They are red with white polka-dots. Between them is a round red coffee table. On the wall to the left is a flat screen tv mounted above a large fireplace. To the right is the kitchen. The backsplash is patterned with tiny clowns, seals, beach balls, and lions. The counter and stove are white, and the cabinets are painted red. These are stocked with foods you might see at a circus or carnival. There's Jiffy Pop, churros, cotton candy, roasted peanuts, etc. The fridge is stocked with healthier food and drinks.

A hallway between the sofas and the fridge leads to the bedrooms. The four poster beds are fitted with colorful polka-dotted sheets and pillows. Surrounding them are red and white striped curtains to block out the light and muffle sound. In the middle of each room, a trampoline is installed in the floor. At the end of the hallway is the bathroom with a checkered floor of red and white tile. The shower curtains follow the polka-dot pattern of the sofas, as does the bath mat. The mirror, sink, and toilet are standard.

A spiral staircase at the end of the hall leads to the second floor and the counselor's rooms. These include a private bathroom, bedroom, and a separate play space, resembling the kind you'd see in McDonald's. The main attraction is the big red slide going into the ball pit.

1l6rl2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1l6rl2h/ventilation_rules/,Ventilation Rules,">Transcription found in a bloody notebook in the attic of residence #39. No children were located at the address. The house's ventilation was sealed with human tissue sewn together with hairline.


---

**RULE #1: Never, under any circumstances, play alone in the woods behind your house.
Unless you want to hear the voice in the ventilation.**

When I was a child, I thought monsters only lived on TV, or in the fantasy books I stole from my father's bookshelf. But that day, at the age of eight, I decided that the forest behind my grandparents' house would be my battlefield. Brandishing a branch as if it were a barbarian's sword, I marched until I found a corner I had never noticed before—a clearing with a pool as dark as pen ink.

**RULE #2: Never touch water.
She is not water.**

The surface seemed to be releasing mist, as if the earth itself was sweating. I leaned against it and felt the cold of a freshly dead corpse. But worse than the cold was the stickiness: my fingers stuck together, as if the lagoon didn't want to let me go. When I heard the sound—leaves rustling, something approaching—I panicked and fell. Water sucked me in. I struggled, trying to climb up, until I felt something hard... something that groaned when I kicked it.

Then came the bite.

**RULE #3: If you bleed in the water, you belong there.**

I ran away, ran like never before, and when I got home, I was dry. Dry as if nothing had happened. Except for the scratch. Far away. Deep. Blood caked on the flesh of a child who should not have survived that bite.

I took a shower. I pretended everything was a dream. My mother praised me for being clean early that night.

**RULE #4: If you hear something coming from the ventilation…
…do not respond.**

Almost asleep, I heard the sound. First a clink. Then scratches. And then…breathing.

""You found it, boy,"" said the voice. Small. Ancient. Fierce.

She talked about the manticore. A sealed creature, imprisoned beneath the forest, that was now waking up. Because of me.

""She will devour your family. Your neighbors. Your bones will not be found.""

**RULE #5: If the creature in the vent tells you to kill it...
…believe her.**

The goblin—yes, a real goblin, with eyes like sad mirrors and skin like slime—told me there was only one way.

> ""By mouth.""



It was everything. The only chance. Kill the manticore through its mouth, before it roars and everyone goes crazy.

**RULE #6: Never take a kitchen knife to kill a monster.
But if it's the only thing you have... take it.**

I left. Flashlight. Do. A photo of my family.

Trees recognized me. They swayed as if lamenting my arrival. The lagoon was there, still, silent, waiting. As if he had memory.

I entered.

**RULE #7: When the water burns out, you've gone too far to turn back.**

I dove in with the heart of a coward who could no longer pretend to be a hero. I tried to see in the darkness, until it appeared: the manticore. Her face was like that of a drowned woman, sewn into a mane of wet bones. His eyes had no pupils. His mouth… was closed.

Closed.

Closed.

But I knew what to do.

I shouted, and she responded. He opened his mouth.

**RULE #8: If you miss, you won't wake up again. Never again.**

I plunged the knife into the beast's throat.

She squirmed.

The water turned to blood.

The forest screamed at me.

I woke up… or I thought I woke up.

I was back in bed.

My mother called me for coffee.

**RULE #9: If everything seems too normal…
…check ventilation.**

I looked in the mirror. My eyes were red. My teeth… they were too much.
One more than normal.

I scratched the wall.

The voice returned.

""You killed the body, not the spirit.""

Now the manticore lives in me.

**RULE #10: If you're reading this...
…it’s already too late.**

You heard the voice in the ventilation, didn't you?
She whispered as you read.
He whispered right behind you.

Now it's your turn to choose:
Facing the night.
Or wait for the roar.

Good luck, hero.

I’m in decent shape, but let’s be real—if anyone offers me seconds at dinner, you better believe I’m saying yes.

Most nights, I’m home chilling with my dog. We keep it simple: backyard vibes, books, maybe some YouTube. Streaming? Meh. I don’t even own a TV because quiet is where it’s at. No, I haven’t seen *\[insert show everyone’s obsessed with here\]*—sorry to crush your hopes. But I’m all about the tunes: classic rock, country, and whatever else keeps life interesting.

I’m into sports—hockey and baseball—but I’m not married to any teams. I just like watching the magic happen.

Now, what am I looking for? Someone who can handle a good dad joke without rolling their eyes too hard, has a unique perspective on life, or just wants to break free from the cookie-cutter vibes ...well, you know where to find me.",2,1749429651.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

# CHAPTER ONE 

\[DRAFT\]



  **Why am I here? I don’t know. Maybe I’m searching for something.**

I open a book titled *THE AGENDA*. Inside is a quote staring at me in bold, **“When we give liberty for normalcy, normalcy is stolen from us also. Now we’ve lost both.”**

My fingers coast along endless shelves of books. The smell of old pages fills the room. All I hear is faint whispers and pages turning. My steps echo off the hardwood floors, and the silence wraps around me; it feels unnatural—suffocating.

Every precious moment I spend reading the backs of dust covers on each book, feeling the textured pages, trying to find *the one.*

I hear distant muffled laughter, maybe teasing. I peek around the corner of a shelf to see two teenage boys, maybe 17 years of age, whispering, their grins stretching across their faces, somehow contagious.

I hear something about “*a pretty girl and her books*.”

My heart flutters.

*Are they talking about me? Maybe. I would not call myself “pretty”, but I’ll take it.*

They come closer, walking to the end of the aisle I’m on. I see their faces in my peripheral vision. I hear their breaths—fast and shallow. I let my long, earthy brown hair shield my face.

*I wish they would come and introduce themselves.*

I keep on reading, flipping each book carefully through my hands.

I’m so *particular*. 

A girl who looks identical to myself walks down the same aisle, looking at me with a flicker of familiarity in her eyes.  She carries a stack of 11 books in her arms, arranged in a way that you can see her face.

*I feel like I know her.*

*Why does she look like me? Maybe she is me—just more free.*

I hear a deep, unknown man’s voice, so disturbing, it sounds like death. He breathes into my soul.

“Time’s up, you must leave.”

I want to speak, but I can’t. I’m caged in my own mind. 

*No. I want to keep looking for books, I have only two. This isn’t fair.*

**Everything fades to a blinding white.**

I wake up to the sound of monitors screeching and the electrical hum of the blinding fluorescent lights above me. Echoes of footsteps scream from the hall. 

*Where am I? I’m not sick—at least I don’t think I am.* 

I look to my right, there is a small steel tray with shiny instruments on it, and a vial of what looks to be—**blood**. The obnoxious smell of latex and rubbing alcohol fills the room.

There is a certain frigidity to this place that can’t be recreated—an institutional chill lingering. 

I look down towards the end of the bed, and the room seems to stretch another 10 feet or so. Heat waves pulse through my head, making the room spin around me like a tunnel. I reach my hand to feel my face. *This is me, this isn’t me, I feel****—dead.*** I’m sweating. 

Hot. 

Cold.

All at once.

A needle administers unknown drops into my arm. 

I pull the neckline of my gown down revealing my upper chest. 

Electrodes.

Everywhere. 

Nothing feels *normal* about this place.

I hear distant echoes from the hall. An eerie woman’s voice says, “ Profile 13B is just down the hall—room 392—I believe.

A man’s voice, cold, sophisticated, but slightly robotic, responds, “Yes. I’ll get to her momentarily, I just need to check on Profile 13A.”

*Am I* ***13B****?*

I sit up in bed.

Blood rushes from my head down through my body. Muscles contract in a way I’ve never seen. It feels like the muscle is ripping away from the bone. Nerves fire on and off, sending electrical pulses through my body that can be described as nothing short of excruciating. I bite my tongue, holding back a cry. *What in the world did they do to me?*

I begin, slowly pulling the needle out of my arm with a surprising numbness. Am I even human anymore? *It doesn’t feel like it.* I pull the electrodes off of my chest, and the monitor goes flat—as if I died. My feet come in contact with the icy tiled floor, and I push myself off the bed. The room spins, and I fall. 

*I have to get out of here.*

That thought drowns out any other noise.

I’m crawling towards the door when I feel a sting in my arm. There is a needle in my arm. It looks more like a dart than a needle. My cheek presses against the floor, and consciousness begins slipping. Loud footsteps approach me. Through my blurry vision, I see a man, dressed in a suit and tie, towering above me. He leans down on his knee, his voice the same voice I heard earlier, “We’re not done with you *yet.*” 

Everything blacks out.

**BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.** 

The alarm clock sounds, slicing through the silence. 

**5:00 A.M.**

I gasp, transported back to my bedroom. The sound pierces through me, fraying every nerve ending. I feel my arm, half expecting the needle to still be there. My pillow is drenched in sweat. My heart is still pounding.

  The world feels frozen, as if time is absent.

 *That wasn’t just a dream—it felt more like a warning.*

I open my eyes to nothingness and look over to my alarm. The red digits peer at me across the room through my blurred vision.

My head presses deeper into my cold, wet pillow. It felt so ***real.*** 

The soft hum of the heater in the corner is just enough to fill the silence. I gently push aside the crisp sheets, letting the cold creep in. 

Shuffling over to my desk at the other side of my room, I blindly feel for the string to my lamp and pull. The dim light is just enough to fight the darkness, sending a ghostly halo through the dark. 

My MacBook, textbooks, and notepads are scattered around carelessly on the desk, but then my eyes stop at the leather journal hiding under a stack of crumpled paper. 

Dad gave it to me for my 17th birthday–just a week ago. He said it would be the perfect place to put my thoughts, memories, and *secrets.*

I reach for it, its familiar earthy smell–somehow grounding.

A journal is the perfect place to write things that nobody else sees. Express emotions that nobody else notices. Sometimes it feels like my closest friend, there to hear my deepest worries.

I flip it open and start to write. 

  


**\[Lainey Ledger’s Journal 01.09.2026\]**



*There is a familiar weight in the air these days. The world feels colder. It has been a little over a month since the CDC announced a national emergency over NOVIRA-26. We’re back in lockdown—just like 2020. There is an intrusive thought woven into me that I can’t quite shake. Something is* ***different*** *about this time.*



My eyes lose focus, the words blurring into each other. I stop writing and listen to my heart pulse in my ear.

There is a sick feeling in my gut that there is more to this. I’ve been raised to question everything---but this is instinct.

There is a large window overlooking my desk, I push aside the curtains. It is still dark outside—no signs of life. The moon beams through the trees just enough to make a shadow.

The window is frosted at the corners. Moonlight patches our long gravel driveway stretching into the dark abyss. The pines sway gently, as if they are whispering to each other. 

I push open the window and lean over my desk, letting the cold air hit my face. The moonlight reflects off my slightly tanned skin. I inhale, letting the night air relax my muscles. The gentle breeze guides shorter pieces of my hair across my face. 

*Wow.* 

My parents built a 3,500 square foot cabin about a mile off a public road, just 20 miles outside of Knoxville, after the panic during COVID-19 hit in 2020. Close enough to the city for good job opportunities, but far enough away to be secluded.

I’m an early person by nature. There is something special about being awake before the world. That silence is like no other. It is a different type of ‘alone’. It is the perfect time for me to let thoughts and ideas surface, and to be aware of my own emotions—time for just me and God.

I make my way downstairs, my fluffy socks muffling each step. 

Dad’s already awake, sitting on the barstool at the kitchen island, resting his head on his palm. The dim light above illuminates the golden streaks in his hair. 

The kitchen smells like fresh-brewed coffee and…worry.

I stand at the last step, looking at him. 

*Why is he awake so early?*

His eyes finally find me, he tenses for a second, not expecting me to be there. “You’re up early.”

I lightly chuckle, “Yeah…I’m always up early, but *you’re never up early*,” I hesitate for a second, “Is there something bothering you?”

“Just thinkin’.”

“You can tell me, you know,” I say quietly.

He runs his hands through his hair, fidgeting a little. 

“Nothin’---um, you hungry?”

I know he’s trying to change the subject. He freezes for a second—as if he just lied. 

He continues, tension in his voice, “I’m not sure, Lainey. I’ve been noticing things. Patterns. The kind you don’t notice unless you question *everything*.”

A weight settles in my chest. *What’s going on?*

My eyes meet his—a distant gaze, as if it could fill the emptiness between us.

“Follow me.” he whispers dryly, rising from the barstool and making his way to the basement.

I trail him down, my hand sliding along the cold steel railing. It gets colder and colder with each step, and the smell of paint and old cement fills my nose, intensifying by the second. I was never allowed down here until now because of ‘*important stuff.’*

He has a private office down here. A wooden desk sits to the right in the corner against the cinder block walls. On his desk is a ham radio, a 24-inch curved monitor, notebooks and pens scattered about, and, of course, a **coffee maker**, because *this is Dad.* 

He sits down in a mesh office chair and turns towards me, his stormy-blue eyes in a steady focus.

“When I was in my late twenties, I worked for the U.S. Army Military Intelligence—Signals Intelligence. I worked with classified radio messages and stuff like that,” he pauses for a second, his fingers fused together. His breaths are deep and controlled.

“Anyway, long story short, I was exposed to some–uh,” he pauses for a moment, then leans forward closer to me—my eyes searching his. “Let’s just say, ***dangerous*** things, information that *normal* people aren’t supposed to know,” he glances at the ham radio and then back at me. 

For a second, I don’t see Dad, I see someone else—someone I’ve never met. *Who are you?* 

“They are Classified HF bands for undercover government operations. If this information is handed to the wrong people, they make sure it doesn’t get *out*,” he says, his voice deep—gut-wrenching. “Luckily, I had enough sense to know it and left immediately, moving across the country and laying low.” 

*They would’ve killed my Dad.*

I swallow a lump in my throat. My chest finally relaxes. I don’t think I have taken a breath since he started telling me these things.

“They transmit the HF bands around 3:00 A.M. EST. They hop between 6.2 MHz and 7.9 MHz to avoid scanners picking up their signals. I have a setup where my monitor is connected to the ham radio, when it transmits, it records the message to the monitor, and I transfer it to a hard drive and delete the audio file,” he says, pointing to the nest of wires between the radio and monitor. 

“Unfortunately, though, the receiver only picks up fragments of the message because they jump between frequencies.”

“Last night,” he continues, his tone getting colder by the minute, “something *concerning* came through.”

He opens the drawer and pulls a matte-black hard drive out, and plunges it into the side of the monitor. A window pops up; he double-clicks on an audio file labeled 2026-01-09\_03:00 AM.wav. 

Mysterious Morse code begins playing.

My sister and her husband were just married a week ago. He has three children - 12f, 11m, 10f. He has joint custody, and I live with my sister and BIL.

Sunday night, after we all returned home from the reception, my sister opened a card from her MIL that contained a $500 gift card. The next morning, the card was still sitting on our coffee table, but the gift card was missing. We scoured the house, but couldn’t find it. My sister assumed she misplaced it and couldn’t remember from the night prior, and decided she wouldn’t worry too much about it and look more another today. 

The day after the wedding (Monday), my sister and her husband were opening all of the cards from friends and family who attended. Her step-son helped her count the money. She put all of the cash into an envelope and put the envelope and all of the cards on her dresser in her bedroom. 

Just today, my sister noticed that the envelope of cash was missing. She and her husband knew 100% that neither of them moved the cash. It was also extra suspicious since the gift card has gone missing too. 

We all because scouring the house for the cash and the gift card. As a last resort, my sister began looking in the kids’ rooms. Upon looking behind her step-son’s dresser, she found birthday cards that belonged to her and cards from her wedding shower behind it. Because of this, she started searching his room more thoroughly and ended up finding the missing $500 gift card hidden between a folded beach towel on the top shelf in her step-son’s closet. 

Because of this, my sister and BIL suspect that his son also took the cash (roughly $1000). On Monday evening, my BIL took the kids back to their mom’s house and his son did have his book bag from the week before. 

How would you approach this with the child? He is definitely a kid who lies a lot. You could watch him do something and he will look you in the eye and swear that you mis-saw and he didn’t do it. 

TLDR: a gift card and cash went missing. The gift card was found hidden in step-son’s closet and we now suspect his stole $1000 too. How would you handle this?",4,1749428825.0,AskParents,5,1.0,False

5:30am- wake up, put on a pot of coffee, make bed
Between wake up and about 6:15am it’s drink coffee and read/crochet then shower, get dressed, read some more, dawdle googling things, changing outfits, writing to do lists.
7:30am drive to work. Once at work I eat breakfast, get myself ready for the day, ready to teach at 9am

i was mad at everyone, wha about what i want? doesnt that matter to my mom at the very least? i stayed and wasnt happy at first. my sister helped me find a job and i went to interview after interview. i appreciated the help, dont get me wrong. a job could really help me out. but after months i couldnt find anything. i arrived mid june and didnt find a job until the beginning of february. my self esteem was at an all time low before my sister told me i was going to work at this small coffee shop at the hospital she works at. i was scared but once i arrived i felt so happy. i was interacting with others, i got to make coffee and all my coworkers were absolutely amazing. i dont care if i was paid 13 an hour i was happy there. going to that coffee shop gave me a reason to get out of bed. 

but there was a problem. after i found it and worked a few days my sister told me to not fall in love with that job, and to find another one asap. i shrugged her words off at first but she kept reminding me. i worked for two months there, i really wish it had lasted longer. but i had to leave florida because my sister was too much for me to handle, sometimes she was angry, rude, yelled and was breathing down my neck asking me to clean. i didnt care but i was at my limit. i slowly rebelled against her by buying things i wanted, a new lunch box, video game, ordered foods i wanted, etc. but i knew not to spend too much. but she didnt like it. she wanted me to save for a car. i agreed at first but pressured me so much i didnt even want a car anymore. 

i felt so stressed out and reached my limit one night when she accused me of having an attitude and talking back at her, saying she wasnt my mother and wont take my attitude. it really takes alot for me to snap but i did and responded back saying i didnt have an attitude. i was just depressed because i felt so empty but didnt know why. (only said i didnt have an attitude) talking back made my heart race, palms sweaty, voice was shaking because she was angry and i was scared. she slammed my door and i started to cry in my pillow. i dont understand what i did to deserve living but i hated it. i went for a walk and called my best friend because he was the only one that responded to my messages. i vented and he listened. after a long time, that was the only time we had a real conversation. 

i missed him so much because i felt like we were drifting apart and i know we are, i cant deny it even now. i felt so alone but that night i didnt. i decided i would come back home to connecticut. i was terrified to even come back home, much more to tell my sister. but i did. i told her i wasnt happy here and want to go back home and if i didnt i felt i would kill myself. it was the first time i said it out loud to anyone genuinely. i cried and said im sorry but i am going home. i put my two weeks notice at work and was so sad to leave the job that made me so happy, but i had to. while this was happening my mom told me it was time to come home too and kept telling me to come back but i said no because i finally had a job. 

when i told her i was going she said “why?” what do you mean why? you were breathing down my neck once i got the job to come home and now that i am you ask why? i eventually cane home after a stressful two weeks and my sister guilt tripping me trying to get me to stay but i didnt waver in my decision. i came home and my mom was happy and nice at first. i got to see my cat again. that was april 30th. after i came i eventually found a job at a supermarket and took two weeks before starting after saying i was hired. i was excited to go work but instantly hated the job. 

i was pushing carts to where they were supposed to be. i was helping out in the bottle return room. i didnt care what i was doing but it was the environment i was in. i wasnt trained, wasnt told where to be and what to do. i was just there. my coworkers were mostly why i quit. my trainer only showed me one thing to do and pushed me away to go do carts. him and two others worked with me but were nowhere to be found so i was working at bottle return and carts. the other coworker was a man that made me uncomfortable by constantly touching me and squeezing my arm. it got to the point i avoided him on purpose. not just the touching but him barking orders at me as if he was my boss. 

he would constantly say my name, more aggressive and more bass in is voice every time. telling me to do this and that. all on the first day. i worked there five days until i left one hour into my shift and quit. that was two weeks ago and now i dont know how to tell my mom i quit. on top of that job she was stressing me out more constantly bothering me about something and never home, leaving me alone. i hated how alone i felt, even now writing this she isnt home. i keep buying things to fill this void i have. food, games, anything interesting on amazon. im sick of it. i dont want to be with my sister but i dont want to be with my mother either. i just want to run away and live under a bridge or on the streets. because i genuinely dont care at this point. i want to die. i cant take this anymore. 

even after all these purchases i still feel empty and lonely, i hate my life. i barely talk to my friends but the times i do i get sad when they leave. i cry over being lonely. i cry over feeling i have no one to talk to. i cry over not having a job to keep me busy and not being able to find one. i had a little over 1k when i came home at the end of april/beginning of may and now i have around 400 left. im falling back into the habit i was in before florida, being home in my bed and feeling alone. i have no idea what to do anymore, i feel like all hope has run out and im just rotting away until im just no longer alive. i really hope i find another reason to smile soon before i just give up.

if you read all that, thank you so much. i wont know unless you say it of course but its nice to know one person might actually give a crap. have a nice day everyone.",1,1749428507.0,venting,0,1.0,False

the friendship we had were like 4yish years. He said nothing happened that night. I tried to bait him to say how he actually feels but he dodged. So Im like oh okay friends then. But then he is also the one who cant act like nothing happened like: 

- i used to send him “i will touch you type of posts” even before things got weird. Now if i send this type of post he just seens it or either doesnt seen at all. 

- Me calling him out for coffee is just us going out to hang, now i cant even do that. I cant even hang as friends :/ (its been a month, he rejected me by not replying to my msg twice, i stopped asking) 

- he just leaves me on seen if i ask him things like hanging out or questions about him (like huh, you weren’t like this before things got weird) 

- before he likes my posts, now he doesn’t. 

somehow one night just ruins it all, and we didnt even do the do. its just touching. Again he was the one who initiated the touching aswell. its just ridiculous how a big wuss he is. Somehow i like this wuss. anyways its a turn off so imma quit liking him.

1. **Thursday** Leadville - early AM, then return to Denver, and then Red Rocks concert this night. Here are the places I am looking at:
* Idaho Springs - Main Street for a pancake and Frothy Cup
* Silverthorn/Frisco - Outer Range Brewery, Log Cabin breakfast burrito for a waffle on a stick, and Rocky Mountain Coffee Roasters
* Leadville - Melanza, the reason I am driving here, I have a 10am appt. Zero Day Coffee, and Mountain High Pies, sadly Two Mile will be closed while I am there, really wanted to snag a sticker and try something here.

2. **Friday** totally open. Not sure how far I will go this day, but I am open to everything, I am looking at WeldWorks in Greely, Vision Quest in Boulder, Denver Biscuit Company for breakfast. I am really open to suggestions for this one though.

3. **Saturday** Rocky Mountain NP - driving up super early to check out Bear Lake, and see how I do with Emerald Lake hike. Keeping this open to some degree, because I am genuinely concerned about altitude sickness, I will be drinking at least 1 liter more water than I usually drink from guides, so I will be hydrated, but I know Emerald Lake hike isn't exactly easy, and I am not 100% sure how much snow will be there.

1l6r2xq,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-06-08/how-cali-became-a-slur-among-vietnams-growing-army-of-nationalist-trolls,"How the word 'cali' has become a new slur by communists against the Vietnamese overseas community, refugee community and descendants, and those who value democracy and free speech:","HANOI, Vietnam — Last fall, Vietnam opened a sprawling new military museum here, and among thousands of artifacts in the four-story building and a courtyard filled with tanks and aircrafts, one exhibit quickly became the star attraction: the [flag of South Vietnam](https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ff-south-vietnamese-flag-20141228-story.html).

The government regards the yellow banner with three red stripes as a sign of resistance to the communist regime, violating laws about inciting dissent. With few exceptions, it is not displayed.

Reactions to the rare sighting soon went viral. Young visitors at the Vietnam Military History Museum posted photos of themselves next to the flag with deep frowns, thumbs down or middle fingers raised. As the photos drew unwanted attention, the flag was unpinned from a wall and folded within a display case. Social media content featuring rude hand gestures was scrubbed from the internet.

But the phenomenon persisted.

Several weeks ago, schoolchildren who were on tour made it a point to check out the flag. Every few minutes, a new group crowded around the banner — also known online as the “Cali” flag — holding up middle fingers or crossing their hands to form an “X.”

In Vietnam, Cali — sometimes written as “kali” — has long been a reference to the [Vietnamese diaspora](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2024-10-23/new-wave-documentary-pop-music-vietnamese-american-director-elizabeth-ai) in California, where many Vietnamese-Americans still fly the flag of the south to represent the fight against communism and the nation they lost with the war.

People who live in Vietnam, however, are more likely to view it as a symbol of American imperialism, and as nationalistic sentiment here has swelled in recent years, evoking the Golden State has become a shorthand of sorts to criticize those opponents.

“They use that as a label against anyone who disagrees with state policy,” says Nguyen Khac Giang, a research fellow at Singapore’s Yusof Ishak Institute, known for its political and socioeconomic research on Southeast Asia.

There have been other signs of growing [nationalism](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-may-03-oe-scheer3-story.html) in the past year, often in response to perceptions of American influence. In addition to animosity toward the “Cali” flag, a U.S.-backed university in Ho Chi Minh City was attacked over suspicions of foreign interference. And an aspiring Vietnamese pop star who’d been a contestant on “American Idol” was savaged on social media last summer after footage of her singing at the U.S. memorial service of an anti-communist activist surfaced.

Vietnamese nationalism, Giang said, is bolstered at every level by the country’s one-party rule.

The [government controls](https://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-ff-vietnam-hip-hop-20150712-story.html) education and public media; independent journalists and bloggers who have criticized the government have been imprisoned. In addition, the party’s ability to influence social media narratives has improved over the last several years, particularly among the nation’s youth.

Since 2017, Vietnamese authorities have employed thousands of cyber troops to [police content online](https://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-asia-fake-news-20190130-story.html), forming a military unit under the defense ministry known as Force 47. In 2018, the country passed a cybersecurity law that enabled it to demand social media platforms take down any content that it deems anti-state. The resulting one-sided discourse means that views that don’t align with official propaganda often draw harassment and ostracism.

At times, the government has also used that power to try and rein in nationalism when it grows too extreme — though banning posts about the South Vietnam flag did little to quell enthusiasm at the museum.

Some visitors who were making hand signs said they were expressing their disapproval of a regime that, they’d been taught, oppressed Vietnamese people. One teenager unfurled and held up the national flag — red with a yellow star — for a photo.

“It’s hard to say if I agree or disagree with the rude gestures,” said Dang Thi Bich Hanh, a 25-year-old coffee shop manager who was among the visitors. “Those young people’s gestures were not quite right, but I think they reflect their feelings when looking at the flag and thinking about that part of history and what previous generations had to endure.”

Five years ago, when a student from a rural region of the Mekong Delta earned a full scholarship to an international university in Ho Chi Minh City, it seemed like a dream come true. But last August, when the school was caught up in the growing wave of nationalism, he began to worry that his association with Fulbright University Vietnam could affect his safety and his future.

“I was scared,” said the recent graduate, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution. He had just started a new job in education and avoided mentioning his alma mater to coworkers and wearing shirts marked with the school name.

“You had all kinds of narratives. Especially with the disinformation spreading at the time, it had some negative impacts on my mental health.”

The attacks included allegations that Fulbright, which opened in 2016 with partial funding from the U.S. government, was cultivating Western liberal and democratic values that could undermine the Vietnamese government.

Nationalists criticized any possible hint of anti-communist leanings at the school, such as not prominently displaying the Vietnamese flag at commencement. Even last year’s graduation slogan, “Fearless,” sparked suspicions that students could be plotting a political movement.

“You are seeing new heights of nationalism for sure, and it’s hard to measure,” said Vu Minh Hoang, a diplomatic historian and professor at the university.

Hoang said the online allegations — none of which were true — led to threats of violence against the university, and there was talk that some parents withdrew their children because of them. Several students said their affiliation drew hate speech from strangers and distrustful questions from family members and employers.

Academics said the Vietnamese government likely acted quickly to shut down the backlash against Fulbright in order to prevent the anti-American sentiment from harming its ties with the U.S., its largest trade partner. But some of the original accusations were propagated by state media and bots associated with the Ministry of Defense, hinting at a schism within the party.

Hoang said that while nationalism is often utilized as a uniting force in Vietnam and beyond, it also has the potential to create instability if it grows beyond the government’s estimation or control. “For a long time, it has been the official policy to make peace with the overseas Vietnamese community and the United States,” Hoang said. “So this wave of online ultranationalism is seen by the Vietnamese state as unhelpful, inaccurate and, to some extent, going against official directions.”

Last summer, footage of Myra Tran singing at the Westminster funeral of Ly Tong, an anti-communist activist, surfaced online. She’d achieved a degree of fame by winning a singing reality show in Vietnam and appearing on “American Idol” in 2019, but she received harsh condemnation from online nationalists and state media when the video from several years ago went viral.

Facebook and TikTok users labeled Tran, now 25, as traitorous, anti-Vietnam — and Cali.

The controversy prompted a more broadly-based movement to ferret out other Vietnamese celebrities suspected of conspiring against the country. Internet sleuths scoured the web for anyone who, like Tran, had appeared alongside the flag of South Vietnam and attacked them.An entertainment writer in Ho Chi Minh City, who did not want to be identified for fear of being targeted, says that as Vietnamese youth have become more nationalistic online, musicians and other artists have felt pressure to actively demonstrate their patriotism or risk the wrath of cancel culture.

He added that the scrutiny of symbols like the South Vietnam flag has given those with connections to the U.S. greater reason to worry about being attacked online or losing job opportunities. That could discourage Vietnamese who live overseas — a demographic that the government has long sought to attract back to the country — from pursuing business or careers in Vietnam.

“There used to be a time when artists were very chill and careless, even though they know there has been this rivalry and this history,” he said. “I think everybody is getting more sensitive now. Everyone is nervous and trying to be more careful.”

Tran was bullied online and cut from a music television program for her “transgression.” She issued a public apology in which she expressed gratitude to be Vietnamese, denied any intention of harming national security and promised to learn from her mistakes.

Two months later, Tran was allowed to perform again. She returned to the stage at a concert in Ho Chi Minh City, where she cried and thanked fans for forgiving her.

But not everyone was willing to excuse her. From the crowd, several viewers jeered and yelled at Tran to “go home.” Videos of the concert sparked fierce debate on Facebook among Tran’s defenders and her critics.

“The patriotic youth are so chaotic now,” one Vietnamese user complained after denouncing the hate that Tran was receiving online.

YC had a problem: she received a great job opportunity [of your choice] in the scenic, uptown city of ‘Orange Bay.’ It’s a bustling hub of college students, nepo babies, ‘artists,’ coffee shops, bistros, ‘innovative’ vegan ‘experiences,’ museums, wannabe-musicians, and wacko ‘spiritualists.’ The location, *perfect.* The job, *a dream.* The issue? There’s only one ‘apartment’ available for rent - and that apartment is a duplex owned by and connected to one of those wacko ‘spiritualists.’ 
It wouldn’t be so bad… only, the two apartments share one kitchen, living room, and bathroom; meaning, it’s impossible *not* to run into the annoyingly eccentric neighbor who’s running [what appears to be] a literal con out of her side of the building. 

That’s right, YC is subject to the shenanigans of a certain Marly Milton - self-proclaimed psychic, medium, healer, and Reiki master. She’s insufferable, at best; downright intolerable, at worst. But, she’s always up to *something*, and knows *just how* to get on YC’s nerves.

I average anywhere from 3-10 paragraphs per post; the more detail you give me, the longer my answers will be. I’m a sucker for detailed character building. I *love* diving into deep, complex emotions, character introspections, subconscious motives, and really exploring the world we create through the eyes of my characters. If given the opportunity, I’ll throw a whole cast in there as well. 

My ‘rules’ are: 

• third person, past tense 

•do not control my characters 

•do not use AI to generate your response to my writing [I don’t want my writing fed to AI engines] 

•be willing to help move the story forward

We spent almost every single day together. He was silly and goofy—just like me. It felt like we were made for each other in that way. I really loved him. But now that I’m out of it, I see how much I lost myself trying to make it work.

Very early on—less than a month in—he had a breakdown and things started changing. He told me I wasn’t allowed to go to therapy. He didn’t want me wearing fitted clothes unless I was with him. I stopped wearing small makeup details that made me feel good (like the dots I used to draw on my face) because he said they attracted attention from other men. I felt like I was being erased—piece by piece.

He once made a comment about my past—that I had been sexually active before we met—and it stuck. It made me feel like I was dirty. Like something about me was shameful, even though I hadn’t done anything wrong. I started to believe I didn’t deserve him. That maybe I was too much, or not enough, or somehow both. I kept trying to leave, over and over again, thinking I was the toxic one.

I tried to better myself without therapy. I started following inspirational pages on Instagram, just trying to remember who I was before all of this. When we reunited after summer break, I finally stood up for myself. I told him I wouldn’t do his laundry anymore. I was always the one cleaning, cooking, buying groceries, fixing things in his apartment—and he never returned the same care. That moment felt like reclaiming a tiny piece of myself.

That night, I tried to end it. This time, he agreed. And that shattered me. Suddenly, I wanted him more. I think now I realize it was because I just needed to know if he still wanted me. Because his actions never made me feel chosen.

We never went out on dates—he hated restaurants. Even a walk was “too boring.” If we did make plans, I usually had to pay or plan them. I didn’t have any friends left. The male friends I had all stopped talking to me after I told them we couldn’t hang out alone anymore—not at coffee shops, not in public—because my boyfriend didn’t want me spending time with men unless others were there. That’s when I really started to isolate. It felt like my world was shrinking.

He had roommates, and I’d talk to them just to feel some kind of social interaction—and I’d get questioned for that too. He’d ask why I talked to them more than him, even though he would spend hours playing video games and barely speak to me.

He convinced me to move in even though I still wanted my apartment. I gave in every time. I loved him. I saw how insecure he was, and I kept hoping that my love could help him feel safe. That if I could just prove I was loyal, it would ease the tension. But it never did.

And even after everything—everything he controlled, everything he limited, everything he made me feel ashamed about—I still love him. I hate that I do. I hate that I think about him constantly. It’s driving me insane.

He moved on one week later. Then another relationship after that. He bounced from me to someone else so easily, while I’m here with a hole in my chest wondering what the hell just happened.

Why can’t I let him go the way he let go of me?

I know I deserve better. But it still hurts that I gave him everything—and he replaced me like nothing.

1l6qzpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/over60/comments/1l6qzpa/i_dont_understand/,I don't understand,"I feel confused sometimes due to my disabilities. Here's what happened at my eye doctor. It goes back.

To give background, this is the best eye doctor in our little town. Recommended by my family doctor many years ago. They take my insurance. 

3 years ago, when picking out glasses, I had a very nice lady to help. She really opened up. As she told me the sad story of her divorce, I listened. Asked questions. After everything was done, I left, saying a prayer for her (privately, in the car). I thought, well, I'm divorced also, so we bonded. I thought, maybe we'll be friends and even go out for coffee sometime. Okay.

2 years ago, I went in and after the ophthalmologist, was sent to pick out glasses. A man I hadn't met before waited on me. My first (friend) was there, but she didn't even say hello. She kind of glared at me. I was totally confused.

I didn't go to the eye Dr last year. I felt very uncomfortable with the vibe from that lady optician. This is a small town place and there's rarely anyone else in at the same time as I go during a weekday. I'm a timid soul. 

So I went last week, after missing a year. The lady who was friendly the first time still snubbed me off. Wouldn't say hello. The male optician helped me pick out my glasses. He told me some exciting news. He was engaged to the lady optician! They live together now. I congratulated him and told how my daughter was dating a nice man she'd met at work. That you could really get to know someone you worked with so it could be a good place to meet. We also talked about his writing. He'd had a book published. Just usual chatting.

His fiance walked by while he was away checking something. I called out to her, ""Congratulations!"" She looked surprised,  thanked me as she walked by. 

That's it. I'm 67. These two are about 10 years younger than me and have kids about 10 years younger than mine. 

I'm still so confused! Why does this lady not talk friendly like she did the first time? 

I love people. I get migraines and try to be kind and not grouchy with people in spite of the pain. If they're too severe, I can't drive. I live alone and don't work anymore. So interpersonal things that are unpleasant, in my interpretation,  are harder for me to get over. ",7,1749428015.0,over60,9,1.0,False
1l6qzhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1l6qzhu/i_feel_like_my_mom_loves_me_for_my_beauty_and/,I feel like my mom loves me for my beauty and also hates me for it,"So I have no clue why it took my whole life till now to realize this… but my mom visited me after not seeing her for 5 months, and it all clicked.

I’ve had long issues with eating, body image, etc since teenage, even though I’ve been always gossiped about, and I realized I’m considered pretty by people. I’ve definitely been asked wherever I go if I’m a model, and definitely been an amateur model for fun at times.

And it all clicked recently.

Growing up, and even now, she only praises me for my looks. How I look like a professional model, I’m tall and skinny, I have pretty lips. She NEVER praises me for who I am inside. Never anything about how hard I work, how much I care and love people around me. Her praises always centered around how I guard and care for my beauty, and the ‘pretty genes’ that she passed to me, my hair.

Nowadays that she’s a bit older, she won’t ever take pictures of me and her in the same photo. She said she just can’t be next to me because I make her look old. She keeps telling me I should get a plastic surgery to fix up my eyelids (I’m half Asian) to make it better, which I have no desire. (She has double lids, I don’t, she thinks it’s a flaw). She says she knows a great surgeon in Korea. Then she says since I’ll be getting surgery I could also pay for her facelift…

She parades me around her friends and people around, as the ‘pretty daughter’. And then turns around says she sacrificed her beauty and youth to raise me and I owe her my life.

Childhood and now too, when I’m with her, I’m never free of camera. Going anywhere with her, she’ll point her phone at me with her camera non-stop. Get me to pose, and often she takes very glamorous angles… not the sweet amateur family photos. Even in the house I’m never free of camera. I was getting ready for an early shift at 6:30 am, just quietly at kitchen making coffee, from the dark living room my mom emerged (she was supposed to be sleeping in her room), already video recording rolling.

It was then I realized I’m a giant living doll for her still.

Curious if anyone else had similar experiences… i don’t know where to begin with this realization. I mean therapy for sure. But like… is there even a word for this? Aside from nmom?",2,1749427998.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

This is a very lonely and terrifiyingJourney that we have been forced to embark upon. My heart goes out to every one of you. It affects absolutely everything and permeates every corner of your life. If it weren't for stumbling across this on Reddit community I probably would have thrown myself in front of a bus.. I'm too busy being a General now  because I have hope. So thank you contributors. So after many hours of research alone with my dogs and open sores all over my body and feeling exhausted nauseous and hopeless I found some things that I thought might work.I took copious notes and filled pads of paper hoping to formulate a plan. With a limited budget and a need to make this happen expeditiously here's what I came up with. I'm going to keep a small diary and I hope this helps.  I had taken Ivermectin before but the dosage was wrong. I did not take anything else with it except Permethrin lotion which kind of kept it at bay but nothing like eradication. The swelling would go down... they just were subdued is the best way I can put it. I'm in the US, in California so measurements and temperatures may differ. I weigh 135 lbs. Not telling you anything but MY EXPERIENCE. You should consult with doctors. Who listen.

DAY 1 - (NIGHT 1 actually,when my meds were picked up)
 IVER.ECTIN
3MG TABS x 8 DAY (24 MG) Every 7 days for 4 wks. (took 5)
ALBENDEZOLE 
100 MG. x 2 (200 MG) TWICE A DAY FOR 3 DAYS BREAK FOR 5 THEN REPEAT 1 X
DOXICYLINE 100 MG 2 x day for  30 days (started day 3)
MAGNESIUM/POTASSIUM CITRATE 210 MG cqpsule x 2 daily (started day 3)
OREGANO OIL CAPLET 4000 MG x 2 daily (started day 3)
SHOWERING-
SULPHER SOAP with exfoliating soap-saver mits, and leaving on body for 10 min. 
ANTI PARADITIC SHAMPOO &
No conditioner. Left it's greasy residual on for next day. Hair piled up in a top bun or french braids. 
I used one towel that had been in the dryer in a plastic bag after also a small towel also from the dryer for the floor. No carpets. They both went into another bag with the dirty clothes  from pre shower. 

SCABISAD TOPICAL SUSPENSION (NATROBA) 0.9% oil
Apply after showering to a cooled clean body neck down including soles of feet on hands. Left on for 12+ hours.  Must wait for 10 min till it dries (I then dressed in clean clothes,
I put the dirty clothes in a plastic zip-tied bag to the garage (for a  washing area I'd pre-designated just for that) to be washed with a laundry detergent AND BORAX cleaning soap, then dried for 1 hr +  on high with oxi/bounce dryer sheet) THEN PUT THAT LOAD IN A CLEAN PLASTIC BAG , and put that clean bag  in another  pre-designated room.
Every time I put anything on I really dry it just in case and the dryer for at least 30 minutes and put it on into clean bleach wiped bathroom with clean bleach white shoes I wear only in the house. I have another pair for outside that I keep by the door also bleach wiped. I bleach wipe the bathroom everything the toilet seats the counters before and after every use. Every time I go in there basically. That goes for the kitchen every surface in the house tables lamps etc. I try to keep to a minimum but I get every shelf. I also have a spray for mites especially scabies that I saturated this house with several times including all the furniture and couch especially turning all of the cushions and then spraying underneath them as well. Bed mattresses got sprayed and flipped over underneath etc. Dog beds too with no blankets afterward.  And then vacuumed  everything thoroughlyagain,  focusing on crevices in every room. I didn't have any Diatomacious Earth at that time, so it was the best that I could do. I always kept socks on clean for bed. Towels went into the bag headed for the wash immediately. On my bed I used one pillow that had been in the dryer with the sheets I used two on the bed ( one for on top of my comforter )which is also very light.

DAY 2  
Albendazole in the morning and night . 2 & 2
Well..I completely FUCKED up and did NOT take my Ivermectin IF YOU CAN FUCKING BELIEVE THAT. I was exhausted from researching, cleaning, dogs, errands for more products BLAH BLAH BLAH... I just forgot. 
I vowed NEVER  to do that again and TAKE ALL MEDS  TOP PRIORITY for day 3 AND THE REMAINDER. During the day I was extremely nauseous and so tired I literally fell asleep while sitting up mutiple times. I couldn't understand what the hell was going on but it was very unnerving also my skin was itching horribly I still hadn't rinsed The Scabisad off yet , and I was feeling very weepy and unhappy because I literally was picking these nasty things off of myself. I applied that concoction I made in the beginning and it didn't seem to help. I was really close to just writing a goodbye letter. I pretty much knew that I was not able to deal with this. Not anymore...and because I KNEW my mind and body were  shutting down.
After about 10 or 15 naps I finally dragged myself up  to go &  pick up the10 lb bag of HARRIS FOOD GRADE D.E., plastic large lawn bags and an antifungal parasitic organic spray that contains copper. And then went home to finalize my shopping lists with Amazon and a couple of others.
 I had now spent everything I could on these so now I had to be content and to wait until my supplies came. In  the meantime I decided to try and stay alive.
Showered in evening, expecting great miracles to have happened .
Not the case.
FINALLY rinsed off SCABISAD after like 18 hrs. Again the sulfur soap and this time I used the parasitic shampoo and a conditioner infused with tea tree oil. Because of my absolutely miserable state and the way my mouth felt, I actually filled my mouth with waterin shower and took the bottle of tea tree oil and poured somein my MOUTH to rinse out. I did this twice. 
I do not recommend this to anyone. 
Horrible stuff. It took me a minute to recover from that.
I did put some SCAIBIDAD ON again post shower. Even though it said only ONE application was necessary. I wasn't sure I believed it. I also added a thin layer of the mixture I'd made pre-treatment. Once again I was a greasy disgusting mess,  AFTER my shower and that was very very disheartening.So  I brushed my teeth, bad tea tree taste still, and rinsed out what I can only describe as a horror show. I stared in disbelief and tried not to hyperventilate and pass out. I'm telling you it was an effort. I did have the sanity of mind after some time to take them from inside sink using a piece of cardboard and tweezers to the outside of the sink so could photograph them; using a zoom. I cannot describe what I saw.( I will post pics if someone wants)
That was another serious breaking point for me. I felt completely invaded by alien bodies. I'm not so sure that they're not, even now. They don't act like something from this planet. They move and act sometimes very predatory and with intent. Their mission is to Prey Upon My Body and they are very stoic in their intention.always moving and fighring ro not detach from ME. Some are absolutely transparent completely and tiny whitish round shapes and they're the ones that are literally EVERYWHERE, in the air on things,  permeating everything; In every single drawer, in dressers, closets, car, animals, shoes, in every fiber of your carpet pets , utensils cupbooards, furniture, cups in shelves ...Everywhere!!  Absolutely Everywhere. And the others are more visible, darker and larger. on sores and open wounds on skin and on furniture and flat surfaces, writing paper and even in the nose and face and hair,  and they are different looking. And now these slimy large more transparent ones in my mouth. Others are in nose eyelashes. Now the mouth???  It is so overwhelming, disgusting and gross, it IS enough for anyone to lose their mind and wish for death to come. 
Despair and hopelessness is a REAL state of mind during this period.
I   G E T  I T
I  FUCKING G E T  I T.
I cannot tell you how long it has taken to build to this pointof complte infeatation. Probably years because I have seen and felt  things during the years that didn't look right to me and I started going to my dermatologist and Doctor years ago. Prior to that is anybody's guess. Maybe 5 years. I don't have a clue. I pray that nobody else gets to this point and this will be a warning to you if you suspect anything at all is not right find a dermatologist who believes you. Even my labs that I did maybe 4 months ago for every single parasite under the sun proved nothing. All negative. I did 90 days of an intense parasite cleanse as well. With activated charcoal incorporated.
Then why did I still have open sores all over my body that is 
 progressively getting worse all the time and spreading everywhere???
Bringing us to NOW. 
Still on day 2.
I had read from one of the kind contributors on the scabies thread that the D.E. was a game changer for them. They literally threw it all over the house with an old sock patting everything even themselves. They even added a couple spoonfuls to warm water and drink it which improved their nails hair and energy . At this point I was over it. It had to work, just  a little bit even. Anything. I would take anything at this point. Period.
It comes with a little duster so I used that and I covered everything in this house. Myself my pups my beds in between the mattresses every stick of furniture every crevice floorboards bathrooms. You name it it's sitting in DE right now. Even me.
Immediately and I mean immediately I felt better. It was stuck to my body because of the oil I had applied earlier but it didn't matter it felt soothing it felt great I started to laugh and smile my heart felt lighter my body felt strangely calmer and any itching or pain stopped. I put more on again over everything dogs myself. When my brother came home he looked a bit startled, but I explained and he too was hopeful again. Now I put this on the clean sheets that and went to bed with my pups in tow. I had brushed them and put a very thin layer of coconut oil infused with essential oil tea tree. We all slept like we hadn't slept in months. Peaceful, long and deep with no bad dreams. 

DAY 3- Today

I did not look at anything on my body today when I woke up. 
The very very first thing I did do  when I got up is (make my coffee) get a big glass of water and take my MEDS... all of them.
Ivermectin, albendazole, doxycycline, oil of oregano, and magnesium/potassium.
I did a little more research on the D.E. add confirmed no harmful effects to pets and committed myself to saturating everything one more time here including myself. It was at this time I was brave enough to take off my shirt second layering of long sleeves to look at my arms and legs. I cannot tell you the feeling of seeing improvement. I have not up to this point. The gratitude I feel and hope! yes, hope. I see an improvement by 50% or more no joke. I still feel some itchy twinges sometimes and I just get out some DE and lightly rub it on my arm. Or wherever I just throw it in my hair too wherever it strikes me & that's okay I just keep putting on a puff or two and go about my business.
 And that is where I am at right now. I have energy and I do not feel sick today At all.I feel clear & happy.. I am grateful . So very grateful. I do not know where my head would have taken me without you guys posting what you know, what you've done and what has helped you. We are not doctors. We are not telling anyone how to do things. We are only sharing experience. That's all we can do. To all of you posting"" there's a light""...I can maybe let myself believe it now. I do not know what's going to happen later but I do know I'm committed and I won't give up. one dhour at a time one day at a time. I want to epress my heartfelt gratitude and admiration for all of you and your unselfish contribution to topic for all of us. I will keep posting too with updates.

To all who are suffering like me:  Stay strong stay committed and vigilant. Love yourself and give yourself a break. You ARE NOT ALONE. Look to these communities for support. Love to you all. I wish you the best.

I noticed OutIn had added a 3d model for the Fino, so I decided it would be good a good challenge to update my TrailGrip model to support it. 

It was a bit rushed, but I got there in the end. My original TrailGrip model was only the second one I'd worked on in Fusion, so it was kinda fun revisiting it at the end of the contest and recreating it for the Fino. I've definitely learned a lot in that time, and I'm sure I've got a lot more to learn.

I really enjoy the challenge of the contests and look forward to participating in more in the future. Good luck to everyone that participated.

Neither of us could afford the full trip even after months of saving but luckily my mum was dating a guy at the time who had a bunch of air miles and offered to pay for most of our plane tickets with the miles. this was a godsend for us as we had no other way of affording it. My mum also helped Frodo out with some money as he was struggling for funds for the trip. She also helped book and organise everything.

It came to the day before the flight and we needed to get a train down to London then stay in a hotel overnight and go to the airport the next day. My mum dropped me at the train station and we waited for Frodo. He had been on a four day bender right before doing all sorts of drugs. ketamime, weed, cocaine, valium. he showed up late for the train and my mum rushed him to the carriage where he got on and was clearly high. he rushed out again to go buy some beers before the train left (9AM btw) and barely made it back before the train doors closed.

I was already annoyed at his actions and he’d worried my mum a whole bunch. He offered me a valium and honestly due to all the stress of him being late i took it. halfway into the train journey he won’t stop talking about drugs and where to get more ketamine. he went to the bathroom and did a line and came back. i was getting more and more annoyed and anxious. for reference we had both always dabbled with drugs but i’d never seen him this way before. 

He somehow meets a guy on the train who has ketamine on him and pulls out a 20 note gives it to him and says “thats my only money for the trip gone hahaha”. i was confused as my mum had lent him like 200 for the trip so clearly he had spent it elsewhere. We get to the train platform and he is so high and drunk he can’t even get off the train. the staff have to come and drag his stuff off as he is making the train late and he is so wobbly we sit on the platform in the baking sun for 35 minutes before he sobers up enough to move.

We make our way to the underground to catch another train to the hotel. we end up arguing about which direction we need to go and i get so insanely angry and don’t wanna shout at him and beat his ass in public so i start walking away to cool down. he grabs the handle on my backpack and yanks me back so hard as i walk away that i drop to the floor. that was it. i turn around and start flying off the handle at him screaming and tryna throw hands and some people break us up. i walk off and go find some coffee place and sit down.

He starts ringing my parents telling them i’ve ran off for no reason and he can’t find me. they ring me and i explain and they suggest we stay in different hotels for the night and meet up again tomorrow to work shit out. we do exactly that and i get an early night for the flight the next day.

I wake up and get to the airport early, get through security and sit down at a restaurant in the airport and text him saying yesterday was crazy but once you’re through security come meet me at this restaurant and we’ll work everything out.

An hour passes. 2 hours pass. the flight is leaving soon and he’s nowhere to be seen. check his snapchat story and he was up all night talking to homeless people around the city and sniffing. they call our flight and i go to the gate and board. as we are going to the runway he texts me saying he just woke up. he’d missed the flight that my mums boyfriend paid for mostly with the air miles. the last thing i text him before the wheels leave the ground (i know i should’ve been on aeroplane mode) is to not get the next flight as he suggested as it lands six hours later and i will have left the airport with my friends. he gets the next flight anyway unbeknown to me.

i touch down and meet my friends for the first time and everything’s cool as fuck im happy again. we leave to go to this lake where i have no data as it’s a foreign country and there’s zero signal there anyway. after a couple hours at the lake we head back to my friends apartment. i open my phone and boom boom boom a million text messages ping from Frodo and my parents and Frodo’s parents.

“Frodo is at the airport where are you?” etc etc

I reply and say we were at a lake for hours and i’ve finally got wifi and i said dont get the next flight as we would have left the airport. he had read that last message and claimed he misunderstood it and to get the next flight. me and my US friends have a long conversation and decide he is too unstable to be with us and would ruin the holiday. He has zero money, is clearly addicted to drugs and was acting aggressive and out of control. i had got to the point where i’d cracked completely and decided our friendship was over and didn’t want to see him again.

I told him all this and he begged me to get him and to meet but i refused and even if i hadn’t of refused my friends refused to pick him up after hearing what had gone down and didn’t want him staying with them. he ends up staying in a hotel for a few days in the US then getting a flight back home.

He got back before me and told my entire friends group i ditched him in the US and left him alone. my phone blows up with my entire friends group messaging me telling me i am a terrible person and how evil i am for what i’ve done. he must have told them what happened from his point of view. my closest friend back home messaged and asked to hear my side of the story. i said it was between me and him and didn’t want to make people take sides.

I lost my entire friends group from back home that day and when i got back from my holiday everyone i knew removed me on all social media and cut all contact

It’s three years on and i am still struggling with the loss of my friend group. I was completely alone and became suicidal for a while but eventually got on with my life by myself and found an amazing girlfriend who has healed me and made my life worth living again.

After all those years i’ve relflected a lot but i need to know reddit, am i the asshole? Did i deserve this?",1,1749427468.0,AITAH,8,0.67,False
1l6qt6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1l6qt6r/am_i_being_discarded_again/,Am I being discarded again?,"six months ago my wife who I have been with for 12 years left me completely unexpectedly.  I had been through countless problems, but if I'm being honest never personally took the time to extensively research her disease.   My thoughts were always, ""I am not a professional so what can I do to help"" and ""If only she'd go back to the psychiatrist and get back on meds things would improve"" I know now these are wrong, and am trying to learn more about BPD to help understand what is/isn't a solution and how I can be more helpful than hurtful

My wife discarded me, stole all the money we had in our bank accounts and moved to another country with someone else. painting me as the abuser.  Within 3 weeks though she was carrying on an emotional relationship, and at times sexual relationship online with me while in this other country.  During this time she pretended that was with living with a gay friend to me, and me loving her to death believed the lie and convinced myself it was true.

Fast forward to about a month and a half ago.  She tells me she hates it where she is and wants to come back so we start planning to get her back here.  She says she doesn't want to tell her friends, and would rather just leave them at the airport rushing off to a transfer to my city after they fly to the US.   To me this plan is completely fucked up but whatever I don't care I just want my wife back.

All goes according to her plans and she is back with me at home, then I get a strange Facebook message and she snatches the phone from my hand. The next day she admits to having a relationship with another person in another country during the last six months, and that she left me..  This is the person she left at the airport who has been calling.  After finding some less than flattering facts about the other persons drug use and because of my own jealousy I try to control her into not talking to this person, and to completely cut them off.   The other person because of all the past stories from my wife of abuse thinks I am holding her hostage, the other person has also been arrested because of her and had the police called multiple times as she does tend to use police and cop calling as a weapon, and after their first arrest they did a ton of research on BPD.

Eventually after blowing up and splitting on this person on the phone she wants to meet for coffee and final closure the next day.  I see him outside of my house and have a conversation with him, and find he's probably not a horrible human being so I agree to allow them to meet.   During their conversation he tells my wife her father is going in for cancer surgery in the morning and she freaks and wants him to take her to her dad's.  I am told to drive 3.5 hours to her dads and at this point I am freaking the fuck out thinking I have been abandoned again.   I call her, and her mother the entire time and after they won't let me even see her after my long drive for fear of me exasperating her situation I say some really terrible shit to the other guy and some to her mom also then head home defeated.  All the while my wife and the other person are saying he doesn't want to be with her after she's been with me and that she does want to be with me.  This was Thursday, 4 days ago.

I apologize profusely for my behavior and meet with the other man the next day when I meet him to give my wife clothes to bring to her dads.  He tells me he wants to help financially as a friend for my wife to get DBT therapy something that is hard for us to afford financially, and he considers her his best friend and doesn't want to see her like that.  He left her at her families where she doesn't want to see either of us apparently, but he insists she does want to come back and be with me, and that he won't be making anymore moves on her.  All of this is incredibly hard to believe because of the previous situation and myself having major trust issues.

I have started doing a ton of research on BPD, getting audiobooks and physical books to read and will do my best to help my wife in the future, but at this point I haven't heard from anymore but the other man which is not really reassuring me much.  I am so scared of a repeat of the last time

I could use some outside opinions on the situation please.    I am being told by the other person I should hang around the area and that she's coming back but I just worry my head is being screwed with since I am not getting any timeline.",4,1749427465.0,BPDlovedones,5,1.0,False

I’m a pretty easygoing 30 year old guy who’s just as down for spontaneous adventures as I am for a laid-back night in with good food and better company. I'm 6’0"", white, blonde (yep, like my username), wear glasses, usually clean-shaven but giving the summer beard experiment a go right now. Physically active and in solid shape at 195 lbs—happy to swap pics once we’re chatting.



When I’m not chasing sunbeams or iced coffee, I’m usually planning my next trip. Travel has been a big part of my life lately, and I’ve got some exciting plans lined up for Asia and Europe next year. I also want to check out more of the West Coast and Midwest.



Live music is a big love of mine. Whether it’s a packed venue or an outdoor summer show, I’m always down to see a band I love. My playlists bounce around from alt rock to electro to indie, but I'm open to almost anything—even country if you've got the right track to convert me. Oh, and I’ve been learning salsa… slowly. Let’s just say I’ve got the enthusiasm down, the steps are a work in progress 



Outside of that, I’m a big fan of manga, the occasional anime, and I’m deep into board games and indie video games. Slay the Spire, Hades, and Fallout: New Vegas are my current favorites. I also like cooking (especially seasonal recipes), baking, dancing, a bit of swimming and being cozy.



If any of that sounds like your kind of energy, I’d love to hear from you. Looking to connect with someone 24+ preferably on the East Coast—but if you're elsewhere in the US and we click, I’m open to seeing where it goes.

Throwaway 

I, 21m was born when my parents were 17. They split up for a bit but got back together and later married. I have a brother and a sister,  13 and 9.  I have an ok relationship with my parents, they were mostly working and bettering themselves when I was a young kid and that’s cool, they’ve done well and my siblings and me have a great life because of their hard work.
 
About a year ago we found out my dad has another son who was born when he was 16. He was put up for adoption at birth. He never said a word to any of us about it, not even my mom. He was dating my mom when this kid was conceived.   It all came out when this guy wrote to my dad. So anyway, it rocked us, but my dad wanted to get to know his son so we supported that.  We met him and so on. I can’t say I’m close to him because I’m not. I don’t dislike him, I’m just not really bothered either way and never have been, it was always about supporting my dad. So a few months later  this guy got engaged and he invited us to the party and that’s when I met ""Lily.""  

Lily is the bio mom of my dad’s eldest son. She was 14 when he was born. I was shocked when I found that out because, 14?! My dad downplayed it, they were kids on holiday and shit happened. My mom was really unkind to Lily because my dad cheated with her but come on, they were KIDS. I guess it’s also because Lily is beautiful. She’s just this really beautiful woman who could pass for 25, though she’s 36. My jaw hit the floor when I saw her and my dads wasn’t far behind. I couldn’t take my eyes off her. Honestly she’s the most beautiful woman I’ve ever laid eyes on. Skin like glass and long wavy soft hair and she smells like candy. She smiles with her eyes and her whole face lights up. 

 So this party goes on and Lily is basically ignored by everybody because she’s the one who gave the son up for adoption, it’s all her fault nobody knew him etc. I really felt for her, she was 14 and my dad wasn’t interested- what was she supposed to do?  Long story short, I felt bad for her and went over to talk because she was sitting alone and we got talking did shots and got wasted. I hadn’t laughed so long and hard like that ever. She’s made a good life for herself y’know. Never married or had more kids.  Shes got a great job, she travels though she lives about an hour away from me. She’s happy as she is and she’s very easing going and chatty.
 
Anyways I went to get her a cab when she wanted to leave, I was feeling brave from the shots and I kissed her before I put her in the cab and she pushed me away after a short hesitation.  I couldn’t stop thinking about her though, hell I was even dreaming about her, and a few weeks later I ran into her in a coffee shop when I’d drove over to the next town to pick something up at a store. I didn’t know she lived anywhere near that town, an hour away from my town could be two dozen places.  Neither of us mentioned the kiss. 

 We got talking again and once again I really enjoyed her company.  She’s wickedly funny and intelligent. We met up a few times after that. Just coffee and talking, turns out we’ve got a lot in common.  I asked her about my dad and she just said it was a summer romance at a time when she was so young she still played with Barbie’s and didn’t really understand how babies were made, there was no love or relationship, how could there be, she was a kid. It happened once.  She didn’t say it but I got the feeling that my dad knew exactly how babies were made and was pushy about sex. (I’ve heard him pester my mom often enough) The pregnancy was traumatic, she didn’t want to go through with it but her religious parents made her. She said it was a relief to have the baby adopted and she never regretted it and she has been uncomfortable about having her son in her life.  To her, his adopted parents are his mom and dad, period but he got in touch and she didn’t know what to do, she felt bad and didn't wanna hurt him etc. 

So you all know what I’m gonna say. We started hooking up. It was my idea, I told her I found her super attractive and was really into her and she was flattered but told me to do one. She wouldn't return my texts for a few days then I'd say something to make her laugh and around we went again until kisses on the cheek turned into making out in my car and that turned  into going to her place for sex. (I have my own place but we always met up in her town because of my family) it took a month of her saying no and me pleading with her to make love before we did it. It was supposed to be a one night stand because, as she admitted, we were insanely attracted to each other and nobody would ever know. We had great sex from the start, we are very in tune with each other physically and mentally and right after the first time, we haven't been able to stay away from each other. I basically moved in after I started spending most of my nights at hers and when I stayed at my place we would be on FaceTime for hours.   

We’ve been seeing each other for 9 months now and I've never been happier and occasionally Lily admits she's never felt so ""contented"" or ""warm."" It’s not just about sex. We cook meals together, we go hiking, I buy tampons in the grocery store when it's that time, she has looked after me when I'm sick with what she calls man flu, we bicker, we watch movies and we talk. We really talk. I feel like I can be myself 100% with her. Basically I’m in love with her, I’m in deep and I want a relationship with her. Hell I want to marry her. I’ve tried talking to her about this and she’s shut it down every time. She says there’s no future and we shouldn’t really be doing what we are doing and she gets all upset so I let it go, I’d rather have her like that than not at all.

 The idea of losing her sends me cold. Despite this, I know she has feelings for me too. She’s very affectionate towards me, in a non sex way. I see the way she looks at me, probably the same way I look at her (an adoring puppyish kinda look which makes us both lame but I'll take it), but she always looks sad and goes and finds something to do until I come up behind her and hug her and she leans into me. I’d kill for this woman. 

Recently it’s all blown up, should have seen it coming I guess. Her son doesn’t have much to do with her but he sees a lot of my family. My mom, I should mention, has a real dislike of Lily despite only meeting her that once and I think that’s because she saw how my dad practically had to roll his tongue back in at the sight of Lily. She makes comments, about being a bad mom, a selfish mom, a whore (pregnant at 14), how she ruined my dad’s life (she was 14 he was 16, I think it’s the other way round). It enrages me but I mostly keep quiet.  

So my dads son came round last week for a dinner and I was invited too. He causally mentioned he had been to see Lily at her place and he thinks she’s got a boyfriend as there were men’s shoes in the hallway (mine) and a second toothbrush and cologne in the washroom (also mine). He said he asked her about it and she denied it. 

Later as I was getting ready to leave heard my parents arguing in their room and turns out my mom had accused my dad of having an affair with Lily.  He flat out denied it but she wasn’t having none of it, and told my siblings to pack their stuff and said she was going to my grandparents. My dad told her she was jealous over nothing and he’s never been unfaithful, he told her she was being crazy, he doesn’t even know where Lily lives- my mom then threw a vase at him. It was getting out of hand and my sister was frightened so I told them. I didn’t even think, I just said it’s me who’s been sleeping with Lily. You can imagine how this went down- it was chaos, both of my parents screaming at me and calling Lily a predator and a pedo and my mom started crying that Lily had gone after her husband and son! Wtf.  I reminded them I’m almost 22, I wasn’t no blushing virgin when I met Lily and I chased her and I'm crazy about her.   I left after that. 

I guess they called my dad’s son straight the way. I was halfway to Lily’s place when she called on my cell.  She was super upset and told me that she couldn’t see me anymore and she was sorry. I went to her place anyway and it took me half an hour of talking through the door to persuade her to let me in to talk. She took a call from her son when I was there and I could hear him screaming at her, calling her all sorts of names.  She ended the call and asked me to leave and I refused, I told her straight that I love her and I want to be with her and she just cried even more, but she hugged me, told me that I’m going to make some lucky girl very happy one day and then told me to go and make things right with my parents. I begged her, I cried, she cried and kept apologising for everything that happened, it was all her fault and she should have known better and so on. It's not all her fault and we are both consenting adults who chose to do what we did and I'm not sorry. She wouldn’t change her mind.  In the end I left and it was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. 

I’ve barely slept since then. I can barely get out of bed and have called in sick at work because I do feel physically ill because I'm so unhappy.  I miss her so much. Yesterday morning her son came round which shocked me as I said we aren’t close, more like acquaintances, if that. He said my mom was worried about me and what that wicked woman has done, he told me he’d be a better son than me etc etc and then he said that he went to see Lily the day before and she was sleeping under a duvet on the sofa and looked terrible, red eyes and wearing what her assumed was my hockey jersey. 

From what he told me- 
He started shouting at her and she shouted back that she didn’t mean to fall in love with me but she’s done what was best for everybody else by cutting me off, what else do they want her to do, shes sorry she's hurt everybody, mainly me, so leave her alone. They argued back and forth for a bit and he left saying he didn’t want to see her again and his real family is my mom and dad. She accepted that and wished him good luck in life. I suspect that she's probably relieved. 

My dad came round yesterday evening. He wasn’t mad at first and I was relieved as I didn't want to fight. He basically said that if it wasn’t for his son he wouldn’t care about me and Lily. He confirmed it was one time, more of a fumble and over quickly and it happened over 20 years ago and he never saw her again. He got a letter when she was pregnant and he never replied because he had gotten his actual girlfriend pregnant by that point- my mom, with me. He said it’s not morally right that I should date the mother of my half brother. He then suggested Lily “seduced” me to get back at him and she’s only attracted to me because I’m a younger version of him.  (I don’t look like him, I’m the spit of my maternal gramps, which is a long running joke in the family about how people would have mistook us for twins back in the day) I told him he was the one who f*cked a 14 year old and 16 is old enough to know better and he should have been arrested for what he did to Lily. He should be in prison. He said he didn’t know she was only 14. Whatever, don’t change it in my eyes. We traded insults which I'm not proud of and he said shame on me for letting a woman come between us, particularly ""used goods."" He then said if I'd got her knocked up she would do the same to me as she did him. I told him that he's sick in the head and he punched me in the face. I kicked him out before I ended up laying hands on him. I genuinely don't see what she did to him. She was 14. It's creepy to me that he thinks he's some sort of victim. He's not. Lily is, and she's handled it all with a grace that he don't deserve. 

I feel like I've been pushed into the role of being a boy, like I'm 16 or something. I'm days away from my 22nd birthday. I'm young yeah, but I'm not stupid. I have my own place, car, job, I pay my own bills. I have hook ups, I've had relationships. I'm not a child and really resent suddenely being treated like one the moment I do something they don't like.  

I was the one who initiated a sexual relationship with Lily, she knocked me back more than once and even after it was done she was the one who worried and fretted and tried to break it off only for me to do everything I could to talk her round. She's not some femme fatale or seductress. That's laughable. She's actually kind of shy in the bedroom and it's the cutest thing. It's a bad joke that she's being made out to be this scheming seductress. Lily is a quiet and sensitive soul, she’s very stubborn too but I know how to make her giggle and win her over. She wants to be a dog mom and open kennels when she eventually retires. My dad said I have to choose and I told him straight, I’d never choose him over her. I won't give her up unless she makes me. She certainly isn't out for revenge at my dad either, she didn't recognise him at the party, wasn't at all interested in speaking
to him and if I mention him she's indifferent. She doesn't care. She doesn't live in the past. Lily seems to exist in her own peaceful little bubble quite happily, she's not a people person at all. She let me into that bubble with her and I want to stay there. I'm just sorry I opened my big mouth and have brought this raining down on her. 

So here I am. Lily won’t return my calls. I’m not speaking to my parents now I guess. I’ve had a few texts from my mom telling me I will be disowned if I have anything else to do with her. I know it’s messy. She’s the mother of my half brother. It’s not like she was ever my stepmom or knew me when I was a kid. I wasn’t groomed. If I’d met her in a bar I would have asked for her number or on a date. I’m not shy with women and have had girlfriends, one of them very long term and we lived together for a while as well. I’ve never been in love before though and I do love Lily. My grandmother called me and suggested it's infatuation and I just need to go and meet a ""nice young lady"" and that will be the end of it. I want Lily. I've known I want Lily from the moment I laid eyes on her. I said that and like my Mom and dad have already said, she said- I have betrayed my family for a ""tramp"" who abandoned her own baby.  Lily is not a tramp, she did not abandon her son and I don't think I've betrayed anybody. 

I feel peaceful when she’s around me. We were basically living together, kissing on the doorstep when I left to go to work, arguing about dog names for a dog neither of us have, goofing around.  I was happy, and she was too. I miss her, I miss her, I miss her. I miss how she laid her head against my chest when we were watching a movie, or how she slept with her body curled into mine and would look up at me with sleepy eyes and smile and say goodnight when we were in bed. I miss how she always drops filling from her sandwiches down her front, or how she bites her lip when she’s concentrating. I don’t care what relation she is to my half brother, I don’t think of him and I don’t know him and neither does she. I’d marry her tomorrow and have a whole bunch of kids or no kids and dogs instead, whatever she chose, because I just want her. Anything else is a bonus.  

I’m planning on going to see her tomorrow and trying to talk to her again. I’d move away and start again somewhere with her,  if that’s what she wanted. I know she loves me, but she’s so damned concerned about everybody else and all those people don’t care about her or her feelings and have not been kind to her. She doesn’t owe them anything. The only thing that makes me sad is not being able to see my kid sister. 

Redditors, am I right to not want to give up on Lily despite what an unholy mess this is? I’m not having doubts, I just want perspectives from people not connected with this. My friend said f everybody and live a life that makes me happy. Am I really a bad son? A bad person?  Should I be selfish here?  My head is a mess but one thing I’m absolutely certain on is that I love Lily and I want to be with her. I need advice on how to proceed. ",1,1749427034.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I've been feeling a lot better now, so I wanted to share my experience with you all who are quitting or thinking about it. This is the longest I've been without smoking for the last 7 years, I'm still young (23M) and don't want to smoke ever again, so feel free to give me any advices you might have!

So far eveything is going well, I'm using medication (dextazin), the treatment is still going, it is a really good help because it made cigarettes taste awful, and made me really sick of them ( at least to me, from what I've seen a lot of people have different reactions). It also helps my physical abstinence symptoms A LOT, like I don't feel like I HAVE to smoke you know, only thing that happens is that sometimes I think ""oh maybe a cigarette would taste really good right now"", however I'm ignoring it, I know that I can't control myself, if I smoke even if just one cigarette I'll be smoking 120 a week like I used to. I just hope this thoughts go away someday because it is really annoying sometimes.

Now, differences I noticed during this week. I've been drinking a lot of water, my body is almost begging for it, I feel like I have way more energy specially in the gym, my skin is starting to glow, my sleep is so much better, everything tastes so good, like coffee, I used to drink a lot of coffee because I would always be tired because of smoking and I needed caffeine to keep me somewhat awaken, however now that I can actually taste it,  it tastes so good, I am now drinking coffee because I love how it tastes. I can also smell a lot better, I can smell people's perfume so well now, sometimes I will just ""discover"" new smells around me just to spend my time, everything smells new to me, is like I'm using my nose for the first time. I'm also way less stressed than before, I can for the first time in years feel what being relaxed really is. The last major difference is that my concentration is WAY better, I couldn't do anything for more than 1 hour without wanting to smoke, but right now I'll be spending the whole day doing some random thing and when I notice is almost night, in my previous attempts to quit smoking it always seemed like time wouldn't pass, but now it does and that makes me really happy.

Well, that's it I guess, please feel free to give me advices, Like I said earlier I don't want to smoke ever again, I know 7 days is not a lot of time at all but at least to me it is a huge step towards never smoking again, in my previous attempts I couldn't go more than just a couple hours without smoking.",4,1749426896.0,stopsmoking,4,1.0,False

1l6qkj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1l6qkj7/my_diary_from_a_haunted_store/,My Diary From A Haunted Store,"Hello I’m Andy and I used to work for three years at one of those clothing stores which is seemingly connected to every mall in North America like a JCPenny or a Nordstrom doing delivery . It was one of those jobs you get when you are just starting college and still living with your parents figuring out what you want to do in life. What should’ve been just a boring and mundane job doing stuff such as packing up clothes, sending it out to FedEx, and unloading trucks for the stock crew before heading home to repeat the day all over again. Yet during my time with the company I happened to collect a lot of stories of weird, strange and outright bizarre occurrences happening at this store. So though I share these experiences with other co workers I felt the need to document my stories here as a kind of pseudo diary.  If y’all like these stories I might post more but for right now I just want to share two stories to get everyone a taste of my time there.

Why not start out with the very first thing that happened to me when I started working there I was told that I would do night shifts from 3-11 in delivery with two other people. My close friend Mason, the guy who told me about the position and another dude named Jayden who I was also friends with from high school but hadn’t talked to him since. For about a month everything was normal. I learned everything I needed to know about the job getting into a nice rhythm. Pack items and send it out for about 3 hours, take a lunch, finish up what's left till 9, wait for a truck to drop off merchandise and unload it. With this night shift going almost exactly like the others, maybe a bit slower but nothing special. So I started messing around with Mason saying “Yo Mason if you had the ability to sleep with any woman you could but you have to fuck her fat best friend first and if she disapproves you lose your shot would you do it?” Mason who was looking at his phone put it down slightly pondering what he heard responding to me “What did you just say” I got ready to repeat myself only for him to cut me off “No don’t repeat it I know what you said just- I guess not” So I then decided to poke him further “Why not you always talk about how lonely you are and here you could get a two for one deal if you think you are good enough” Jayden who was sitting a bit away from us getting slightly annoyed with conversation butts in “Can you both be quiet neither of you have even lost your virginity and I don’t want to hear you philosophize on being able to screw fat chicks for approval” And if right on cue before I could even get another world out the store intercom would loudly state “THE STORE IS NOW CLOSING OUR STORES HOURS TOMORROW ARE FROM 10am-9pm….”

Clearly seeing I was shut down twice I decided to go to the restroom to take a piss and get out whatever I could before the truck got to the store. After thoroughly relieving myself I went to the sink looking down to get some soap and water only to look up and see an extremely tall and lanky mime right behind me. This scared the hell out of me and immediately tried to turn around, almost falling down in the process screaming “Holy fucking shit” but he wasn’t there. I looked right back into the mirror and he was still there clear as day, his forehead and hair just out of view of the mirror but the sunken blue eyes staring right through it. I hesitantly tried to reach back seeing if I could grab something to see if this was real or my eyes playing tricks on me. I was able to grab what I thought looked like his shirt around the chest and give it a slight tug but it wasn’t cloth that I touched. It felt like saggy leather with something like charcoal covering it which made me realize that what I was looking at wasn’t a man in clothes but someone more likely painted head to toe to look like a mime.

I immediately ran out the restroom as fast as I could repeating over and over “What the what the fuck…SECURITY… MASON… JAYDEN… there some fucking creep in the restroom painted as a mime” And as I got to the dock Mason and Jayden were already on there way to me yet as I stopped to try and explain they both in unison said “Dude who the hell is that behind you” and as I turned around to see if I could confront this peron I didn’t see them. I exhaustedly but quickly said “I don’t see them but there was someone he was in the bathroom and and and he was huge he must’ve been at least 6’5 or some shit” And as I kept going Mason shook me still to get me to calm down and he explained something extremely uncomfortable to me. “He is still here. I think he is coming out from your back This man is attached to you.” As if to try and conform to what he was saying I reached back yet again to feel the charcoal laden skin. In shock of this situation Jayden tried to contact security but the store phone stopped working, so he tried to text them yet the message didn’t go through no matter what he tried, he tried to use his phone to call 911 yet nothing. He tried to leave the docking area to see if he could talk to security in person yet the doors were all sealed shut. Mason during the meantime wanted to see how he could get rid of it by grabbing one of the tape guns to hit it but I stopped him  just before saying “Mason don’t try to hurt whatever this thing is. It's attached to me what if you hurt it and that reflects on me what it is even doing.” He responded swiftly “Nothing its just following me with its eyes like it's waiting for me to hit it. Nothing else is even moving on his face, just the eyes.” I with a little less haste and exhaustion said “See that thing probably wants you to hit let's just see if we can find a way out.” Right as I stated this we would hear a loud truck horn and a backing up signal noise from outside. It made us all snap back to why we were currently at the dock to begin with Jayden stating it for us out loud “Wait the truck” he stopped for a small bit “Maybe the driver can get us some help”

Yet the door outside didn’t open either. This man attached to me somehow without even lifting a finger or saying a word was stopping us from leaving this area. In our confusion the metal door we used to unload or load items onto a truck opened on its own. We decided to look inside all that sat on the truck was a single pallet with a paper on that said “to the fourth floor” in our confusion we looked at each other and probably shared the same thought of “the fourth floor there's only three here” yet as we took the pallet off the truck and into the freight elevator we had to take pallets to higher floors low and behold there was new button plain as day that was labeled as the 4th floor. Reluctantly Mason pressed the button and as we reached the 4th floor with the elevator doors opening up we saw an exact copy of the first floor not a single thing different. We then unloaded the pallet and brought it back down but as we got back on the elevator Jayden turned to me and said “The mime he's disappeared.” Typically when something happens to one of us it always stays there until we leave or the next crew comes in. And it always reoccurs at least once yet The Mime never did. It seemed to be the one thing that broke the rules of this place, at least those two constants.

The next day after this also took place I confronted my boss about this telling him everything I could and that both Mason and Jayden would back me up on this. Only for my boss to respond with something that stayed with me the entire time I was there. “Andy I am very sorry that I put you in that position. We hadn't had anything happen to anyone in over a year and we assumed it was safe.” In shock I responded “What do you mean put me in that position?” He stated bluntly “There is something wrong with this store for some reason whether the store is haunted or cursed recurring events happen they don’t harm anyone unless you interfere with what they are doing or don’t do what they tell you. Everyone in the store knew this but about a year ago it stopped all together. So we eventually stopped telling new hires about it. That's my fault and I wouldn’t blame you if you quit because of this.” I honestly should have to this day I knew I should have but for some reason I didn't. Something in my mind kept me there whether it was knowing if I didn’t do anything the upcoming events wouldn’t harm me or the fact the first time though creepy was mostly harmless I stayed.

For the final story of this post I will skip a couple months ahead. By this time I had gotten used to the creepy events whether it was the third floor starting to grow trees with different fruit every Saturday or the two cartwheeling human sized ants in the mens section that would verbally harass Jayden. No matter how strange I never thought I was in danger like that the first time, if I don’t harm them nothing bad will happen to me or so I thought.

One of the recurring events that would happen to me and only me was if I was closing by myself ever when I would try to leave the blank completely white mannequins would come alive, morph into these glossy almost perfect human people and start running the entire store. And I mean entirely some were salespeople selling to other fake people, some ran the coffee shop on the first floor and some ran the entire restaurant upstairs. Now I had gotten permission from the restaurant owner if I was closing to be able to take some of the tomato soup jars they had for sale if I put the money next to the register they had. This has never been a problem for me. I loved the soup and would constantly have it with my dads famous pepper jack grilled cheese on a cold night. Yet I never did this while the mannequins ran the store but I knew if I didn’t harm them I was fine.

So one night when Jayden and Mason both couldn’t make it I decided I wanted to get the soup as it was extremely cold that night just under 20 degrees. And as usual when I was done with everything for my shift the mannequins came alive and started running the store. I made sure very carefully to avoid them on the escalators to the third floor, grab my soup and put my 8 bucks and some odd cents on the counter. But as I was just stepping out from the restaurant I heard someone from behind me yell in a weirdly gurgly tone “WAIT… where do you think you are going with that” in shock I assumed one of the security people were still there so I turned around and said “Hey sorry I didn’t know anyone was left here I got permission from Jacob to get some soup before heading out” only to notice that it was one of the mannequins talking to me and it looked exactly like Jacob the restaurant manager but with glossy skin. Maybe I noticed it then but definitely after this happened I started noticing all the mannequins looked like people working in the store or customers who were there that day. So Mannequin Jacob in still that some gurgly tone responded “You are trying to steal from the store” only to then squeal like a pig before I could even explain which made every other mannequin stop it was almost like the store froze while the soulless happy go lucky mall music played over head. At that moment I realized when my boss said not to interfere with the things that happen here he didn’t mean just harming things it meant to avoid it entirely.

I tried to get out of it by saying “Ok my bad I will just put the soup back you can keep the money I have” but it was far too late and kinda stupid of me to even try. The mannequins all were transfixed on me still and as I started to walk away assumed I was saying I heard a ear piercing “THIEF” be screamed all around me. The moment I heard this I tried to run but they all surrounded me quickly. Some grabbed my arms, some my legs and others my hair, I was powerless yet I barely managed to get out of their grasp. And as I broke away all I kept hearing was that same word “THIEF” over and over. I was able to leave the building but they still followed me and as I kept running towards the truck my dad gave me for work. I was looking back to see the mannequins falling apart and running and placing themselves back together with some being their own falling limbs as well as others. As I got into my truck I tried to turn it on but it started stalling while the mannequins got closer and closer so close in fact one even broke my passenger window and another got into the bed of my truck. And when it started I immediately put it into drive running over the curb and speeding out of there. The mannequin in my bed flying out by the time I got on the road.

By the next morning I was told the mannequins were laid all out in the parking lot by management and needed to explain what happened when I come in.When I told them what happened they explained to me I was lucky because if I didn’t put that soup back and tried to leave with it I would’ve become a mannequin the moment I left the building. Apparently someone did it a long time ago, stealing a shirt when the mannequins were around and that's how they know. Safe to say I buy the soup normally now before closing. And I damn well make sure to never touch anything while I am dealing with the mannequins.

1l6qjtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1l6qjtz/mcas_vs_anxiety_a_little_confused/,MCAS vs Anxiety… a little confused,"Hey yall! Recently I have learned about MCAS and felt like it might be an explanation for my symptoms but I’m not sure.

Basically, I started having bad “anxiety” since middle school. But my symptoms have always been very physical, not typical mental anxiety symptoms (although I can when things get bad). These can include any of the following:

- nausea
- vomiting
- diarrhea
- chest tightness
- heart feels like it’s beating heavy
- face flush/hot flashes
- hives
- eczema worsens
- lightheadness 

Usually it happens in certain situations (especially when traveling, or if I have something important), but will also happen randomly. Like, a few weeks ago during work, I was helping a customer and all of sudden I got super hot, nauseaous, felt like I couldn’t breathe, and like I was gonna shit my pants all at once. What I typically would call an anxiety attack, but now I’m thinking it’s not? 

I’ve also experienced this “anxiety” with chest tightness and my heart beating super heavy after drinking alcohol or similarly when I eat a lot of junk food or have a lot of coffee. 

I’m still trying to make sense of this and was hoping for some insight! Thanks!",2,1749426707.0,MCAS,1,1.0,False

1l6qjoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShiaMuslimMarriage/comments/1l6qjoe/navigating_marriage_search_as_a_revert_21f/,Navigating marriage search as a revert (21F),"Assalamualaikum. Back in 2023, a lady from my community approached me on behalf of a guy in the community who was interested in marrying me. I will call him Hasan. I didn’t know it was him at the time, but I later pieced it together. I declined because I was involved with another prospect at the time. Things didn’t work out, and Hasan sent me a facebook friend request about a month after things got broken off. I didn’t think much of it because I hadn’t pieced it together at that point, but in July 2024 his sister in law directly asked me if I would be interested in marrying him. I declined claiming I was busy trying to finish school. I didn’t think he was my type, but I decided to say it that way because I thought I might change my mind. 

I had my eyes on another prospect back then and actually had unfriended Hasan (and all other non-mahrams) on facebook. I decided not to pursue the other prospect because he wanted to move overseas. I initially thought I would be interested in moving overseas, but my dad has been having some health issues and I’ve decided I want to stay closer to home to care for him.

I couldn’t stop thinking about Hasan because I realized I might be missing out on a great prospect. I came across a hadith from Imam Baqir ع that said something along the lines of “If you accept his manners and his religion, he deserves to get married”. He comes from a great family and no one in the community has a bad thing to say about him. He earns a halal income, helps out around the mosque, and overall seems to be a very decent man. His brother is married to a revert too, and they seem to be very happy. 

I decided to send Hasan a follow request on instagram and he accepted very quickly. He slid up on a meme I posted on my story once once with a laughing emoji, but other than that he and I didn’t talk leading up to ramadan. I went to a college about 2 hours away, but I came home on weekends to visit my home masjid during ramadan. The first night I was there, I walked in and his sister in law was smiling really big at me. When we went to pray salah, I saw a lady behind me that I’d never seen before. She told me “that’s my mother-in-law” (meaning that’s hasan’s mom). She’s visiting from Saudi. I saw him point me out to her the first night I came to visit from my college town. She and I don’t share a language, but she seemed to approve of me. On eid, she took a picture with his sister in law and me. Then, she took one of just her and me. They tried to invite me to dinner with them on eid, but I actually had already driven back to my college town by the time his sister in law texted me. 

Since then, he’s sent me brief replies to my instagram stories here and there, but it’s hard to start a conversation with him because they’re very brief (eg I posted a dua and he said “Inshallah🤲”). His sister in law knows I just finished my degree, and I’m honestly surprised she didn’t bring up marriage during Ramadan. She and I even got coffee between iftar and amaal one night and she didn’t bring it up at all.

I am interested in him, and I think he is still interested in me too. Should I wait to see if they bring it up when I see them at the mosque? Should I reach out and just ask them? Should I make an effort to start a conversation with him directly? ",2,1749426691.0,ShiaMuslimMarriage,3,1.0,False
1l6qjdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1l6qjdj/i_always_pay_for_my_friend/,I always pay for my friend,"My friend and I went out recently. We started the night at a cocktail bar, and the bill came out to around $200. We were going back and forth about who should pay. She said she got it, but it didn’t sit right with me. She told me to get her tacos later, but I insisted on paying. So I said, “You can get the tacos later, and I’ll get the drinks now.” She agreed. I ended up paying the full $200 bill. Which was still fine with me. I wanted to pay. Keep in mind, she ordered an expensive bottle of drink to share-I only ordered one drink, and shared the rest. 

We went out for the rest of the night, and I also paid for her drinks at the club. She only paid for two shots-I ended up spending $120 at the club for her and my drinks ( she drank all my drinks too). Still, I didn’t mind at that point because we had a clear agreement—she’d cover the tacos later.

After the club closed, we went looking for tacos, but every place was closed. So we went to IHOP instead. When the bill came, she said, “Let’s split it,” and I said okay. I was beginning to get a little annoyed at this point. 

The next day, we went out again and grabbed coffee. I said, “Let’s split,” and she said, “We can’t really split in the driveway—just Venmo me.” Then she added, “You can Venmo me, if you want,” all annoyed, which rubbed me the wrong way. I still paid her, but her tone made it feel like she didn’t trust that I would. As soon as I sent the money, her energy changed into a happy mood. 

I genuinely like her, but I’m starting to feel frustrated. I always end up paying for her drinks, food, and outings. Yet she still expects me to Venmo her for even small things like coffee or McDonald’s—even after she had clearly agreed to cover tacos in exchange for the drinks I paid for. It’s starting to feel unbalanced, and I’m honestly getting annoyed. What do I do? Should I talk to her? Or be more mindful next time?

1l6qiah,https://www.reddit.com/r/Quittingfeelfree/comments/1l6qiah/30_hours_into_detox_fasting_my_personal_protocol/,30 Hours Into Detox + Fasting. My personal protocol.,"I slept fine last night, no noticeable issues. I don’t think I’ve had a full-recovery sleep in a very long time, but this sleep felt normal.

The day was good. No noticeable withdrawals, but the body temperature is starting to be noticed. Some cold sweats, feeling like I need to wear long sleeves.

But I went to the gym today, even when I was feeling groggy and sore again. Movement is medicine.

Sauna for 15-30 minutes each day, even if it’s twice a day durning this, is a godsend. I highly recommend it in general, but especially every day or twice a day during the detox process.

I also ran outside and took some time to walk barefoot on grass. Get that sunshine, get that earned sweat from a run or workout, and put your damn body on the earth again.

When I get even a whisper of desire for FF, I do some body movements, a quick exercise, a body shake, or something physical.

Then I do some conscious breaths. Double-inhale through the nose, and a pursed-lip, long exhale through the mouth. Repeat as long as necessary and then just feel into the body silently. Any type of breathing practice will be extremely helpful though.

These are all habits, small daily habits that I am re-incorprating into my post-FF lifestyle. Building a new lifestyle and having free and easy practices to do is how we keep staying on track for good.

I was in the best health of my life before taking this Psycho Tonic. And then it robbed me of all of the self-love and self-care habits I had.

I haven’t eaten in 24 hours. Tons of electrolytes (I use 1 to 2 LMNT packets per day). Electrolytes will help the detox for anyone, since the FF has ripped so many nutrients from the body.

I drink coffee sometimes or a chai or matcha, raw milk, caffeine-free herbal tea, green juice powder, and kombucha during the day. Then I treat myself to a tall glass of organic bone broth at night. For me, any type of prolonged fasting is also powerful medicine for my body and mind. But it’s not for everyone, I am just experienced in it already.

I am doing all this to not only mitigate the withdrawal effects for me, but also to allow my gut microbiome to rebalance much faster. So much of our cravings for anything comes from the bacteria in our gut. I will also be taking some collagen and colostrum powder after the fast and moving forward, to speed up healing of my skin, nails and hair.

I am trying to keep myself busy, moving, and as much time outside in the sun and grass as I can. I am also consuming all the episodes of the Kratom Sobriety Podcast.

I am also telling more loved ones about this journey. Each time I tell somebody I care about, I feel more weight being lifted and more confidence that this experience is going away for good.

I’ll see how tonight goes. A lot of meditation and prayer works well for me personally on a restless night. May need a midnight hot shower or epsom bath.

Luckily I got a project I am working on next week where I have to be in-office. And I let the team know I was doing a serious detox so they can be aware and check in on me.

Much love to you all. Hope my writing may help one person. I know everyone’s experience and recovery is unique.",2,1749426585.0,Quittingfeelfree,3,1.0,False

She historically had issues with low self esteem. Recently..... within just a span of about 2 months, she dropped a LOT of weight. Weird comments started to come from her:

1. She told me she has a fantasy of watching her have sex with another man (not for me!)

2. She told me her co-worker masturbates to her. (Totally inappropriate, why was he so comfortable telling her this... what reaction was she looking to get out of me?)

3. I am in the military. She recently said ""Hey, you should get a hall-pass when you deploy.... you are coming home to me anyway"".

4. She said guys are starting to buy her coffee in the morning on way to work

5. I was away on a trip. She is usually never out late. Well she came home at 1:30 AM (saw it on the Ring/Blink). I went to text her about it later that morning but I found she deleted the footage. When I texted her about the weird comments and now the deleted footage, she became super apologetic. She stated she recognizes it seems sketchy but she has gained more confidence and more attention from other men lately and that they are just fantasies.

  
I shut down on the trip I didn't talk to her. When I came home, she was completely unemotional and said she wants a divorce, she loves but no longer in love with me, and that's it.

## Key features Analysis

The quality of unflavored protein powder hinges on several critical features that influence its effectiveness, usability, and overall value. These features range from the protein source and processing methods to the purity and mixability of the powder.**Protein Source:** The protein source is the foundation of any protein powder, influencing its amino acid profile, digestibility, and suitability for specific dietary needs. Whey protein,derived from milk,is a complete protein containing all nine essential amino acids and is known for its rapid absorption. Casein protein, also from milk, digests more slowly, providing a sustained release of amino acids. Plant-based protein sources, such as soy, pea, rice, and hemp, offer vegan-friendly alternatives, often with a slightly different amino acid profile that may require blending to ensure completeness.**Protein Concentration:** The percentage of protein per serving is a crucial indicator of the powder's effectiveness. A higher protein concentration means more protein per scoop and fewer fillers or additives.Look for powders with at least 80% protein by weight to ensure you're getting a concentrated source of amino acids. Check the nutrition label carefully to assess the actual protein content and compare it across different brands.

**Ingredient Purity:** Purity refers to the absence of unnecessary additives, artificial sweeteners, flavors, colors, and fillers. High-quality unflavored protein powders should contain minimal ingredients, ideally just the protein source itself. Avoid powders with excessive gums, stabilizers, or other chemicals that can detract from the product's nutritional value and perhaps cause digestive issues. third-party certifications, such as NSF International or Informed-Sport, can provide assurance of purity and quality.

**Mixability:** Mixability is essential for a seamless blending experience. A good unflavored protein powder should dissolve easily in water, milk, or other liquids without clumping or leaving a gritty residue. Poor mixability can result in an unpleasant texture and make the powder challenging to consume. Some powders are instantized through a process like lecithin addition, which improves their solubility.**Particle Size and Texture:** The fineness of the powder particles affects its texture and how it disperses in liquids. Finer powders tend to mix more easily and have a smoother texture, while coarser powders may feel gritty or take longer to dissolve. Consider the particle size preference as it can influence the overall experience.

**Manufacturing Processes & Certifications:** The manufacturing process directly impacts the final product. Cold-filtration or micro-filtration methods prevent degradation of amino acids during production, retaining nutritional value.Certifications like ""grass-fed"", ""organic"" or ""non-GMO"" reflect production commitments to ethical and lasting practices.

## Core Benefits

Unflavored protein powder provides several key benefits that make it a popular choice among health-conscious individuals. Its versatility, purity, and controlled flavor profile make it an adaptable addition to any diet.

**Customizable Flavor:** One of the most significant benefits of unflavored protein powder is its ability to be added to any beverage or food without altering its taste.

They provide a pure source of protein without unnecessary chemicals or fillers.

**Easy Incorporation:** Unflavored protein mixes seamlessly into a variety of foods and beverages. This includes smoothies, oatmeal, yogurts, baked goods, soups, and sauces. Its versatility makes it a convenient way to boost your protein intake throughout the day without considerably altering the texture or taste of your meals.

1l6q7rq,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1l6q7rq/major_struggles_dialing_in_flair_signature_and/,Major struggles dialing in [Flair Signature and 1ZPresso J-Ultra],"I recently got a used Fair Signature to jump into the world of espresso with. I've spent the past three days and two bags of coffee trying to learn how to dial in, and I have been having a very hard time. I would describe myself as very advanced in pour over (I can dial a v60 with just info from the bag and maybe one or two cups), so I will admit I came into this with more confidence than I should have. After all this trial and error, I am deeply frustrated and wondering why I can't get a single good-tasting shot no matter what variable I play with. 

Taste: I am getting a wacky mix of bitterness and sharp sour acidity that lacks depth and sweetness. The texture is pretty good, maybe a little thin, but I am pulling light roasts at a longer ratio, so I expect that.

Bean into: I am using a washed Colombian and Guatemalan espresso labeled blend, roasted by Lost Coffee here in Colorado on the 26th of last month (13 days ago). There is little to no varietal information, which is annoying. It seems to be roasted pretty light for espresso. For pour over, I would call it a medium light.

Dose: I am using the Flair standard basket, which is \~40mm and quite deep. I am dosing 15.8 grams of this roast, which is enough to sit close to the shower screen and post shot is swells to make light contact with the screen. This is the first thing I am not sure I am doing right.

Yield and time: I've tried yields from 32 grams to 36 grams. I find the best balance \~34 grams, but this could also be wrong. I am pulling these shots in around 40 to 50 seconds. 

Workflow: I am heavily preheating the brew cylinder and using a kettle temperature of 198, which drops sorta unpredictably. I am using WDT and a non-self-leaving calibrated tamper. My biggest problem is the pre-infusion. Even when the result tastes bitter like it's ground too fine, the pre-infusion gushes out at as low as 2 bars. After it gushes for the pre-infusion, and I ramp up pressure, the flow seems normal. I can't tell if the grind is correct or if the gushing is from channeling. If I go any courser, the shot just gushes the whole time, and I get battery acid. I have no idea what to do, but I feel like my gushing preinfusion is the biggest hit I have as to what is going on.

This is the one part I *really* don’t understand:

* I try to ramp up to \~2 bar slowly (within 5 seconds)
* But **instead of gentle drips**, I get an **immediate, strong stream** during preinfusion
* This happens **even on shots that later taste overextracted or bitter**, which confuses me

Once I hit full pressure (7–9 bar), the flow seems normal, and the shot runs to completion at a steady pace. If I try going **any coarser**, the whole shot gushes and tastes like **battery acid**.

I can’t tell:

* If the grind is actually dialed
* If the preinfusion gushing is from **channeling**, **dose height**, or **puck prep**
* Or if this is just a technique thing I need to keep practicing

**Any insight on what might be causing this weird preinfusion flow?**  
Especially from other Flair or lever users? Does this sound like an issue with puck integrity, dose, or technique?",1,1749425751.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1l6q6sn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l6q6sn/people_are_checking_into_motels_and_ending_up/,People are checking into motels and ending up nowhere,"It started with Aisha Baker. 

My patrol area included the Motel Mile. There's plenty to keep law enforcement busy there. I don't think motels were ever *great*, but if you have a legitimate need for a place to stay these days, law abiding citizens are almost invariably using airBnB and VRBO. 

We got called for altercations frequently. Most of the motels were spaced out, the “mile” was actually several miles; but two were across the street from each other, and the owners were as bad as the patrons. They'd get into drunken brawls in the road sometimes. Marvin said it's a feud that dates back more than 50 years. 

My partner, Marvin, had been on the force a long time. He hadn't said as much to me, but if he had a motto it was probably “pick your battles.” We didn't make a fraction of the arrests we could have, but he said it's better to know where the rats' nest is.

We got a lot of missing persons cases in our town that wound their way back to the Motel Mile. Some were harder to trace than others. Sometimes people were reported missing from there. Other times we were asked to go have a chat with one of the managers or the other, on account of Marvin's long standing relationships with them. They typically clammed up as soon as he said it was a missing person, and Marvin would lean across the desk and in a conspiratorial tone say, “I'm not trying to make your life difficult. If you can just give me a yes or no, was she here or not? And I'll leave you alone.”

They'd begrudgingly say yes, or maybe insist the answer is no. We'd get in the squad car and sometimes he'd say, “Sumbitch was lying to me,” before calling in a report with the conclusion he came to. I didn't know how he could tell they were lying, honestly, but I studied their responses to try and learn what he saw. You need five years on the force and to sit for an exam, but I wanted to make detective someday.

If you're wondering how so many missing persons cases were going unnoticed, it comes with the territory. The clientele at these places were usually either there for prostitution or drugs, but there were also extremely cheap or extremely poor tourists on road trips. Our town is a no-name place but it is the halfway point between two larger cities. 

Most of the missing persons cases were more or less what you'd expect. Working girl ran off. Junkie wandered into the woods. Traveler on their way from nowhere to nowhere went missing somewhere along the way, but stayed in our town one night.

We had what I thought was a regular case of a girl running away. Her parents called it in. Aisha Baker had just turned 18 and had been seen in the company of a petty criminal, before getting into a fight with her parents, storming out of their house, and not returning.

I didn't think much of it, but we got the call to go ask around at the motel where this criminal, Everett, was known to set up shop, and Marvin didn't like it.

“Everett knows better than to mess with a girl like that,” he muttered.

But still, we did our job. Marvin spotted Everett's car and parked us behind it, blocking it in. We then paid a visit to the front desk. The owner’s daughter was working. She seemed too young and too pretty to be in such a seedy motel.

She gave us a shrug and a copy of a room key. “She checked in last night. Didn't check out. Room was empty so housekeeping turned it over.”

Everett had seen us pull in, but had wisely decided not to try to run for it on foot.

He burst out of his room as we were on our way to check out her room. “Marvin, I don't know what happened to her. You gotta believe me, she said she just needed a place to crash so I got her the room, I didn't touch her, I wouldn't do that to Elijah, please you gotta tell him I don't know, I wouldn't do him like that. I never laid hands on a girl in my life,” he babbled, clearly distraught, his pale hands practically twitching.

Marvin put his hands on his hips. “Slow down,” he said. “So you were with her?”

“No I - well yes. She had a fight with her parents and needed a place to stay,” he said. “I wasn't with her, with her. I just said I could spot her.”

“Out of the goodness of your heart?”

Everett fidgeted. “This is more fucking trouble than it's worth,” he said. “Never shoulda messed with a rich girl. Elijah's going to kill me. I thought I was doing him a solid.”

Marvin said, “Look, you and I, I like to think we have a pretty good relationship.”

“Oh absolutely, I never lie to you, you know that, Marvin, buddy-”

“So what we're going to do here, is you're going to tell me what you got. If you have anything on you, you'd better return it to me. Call it a token of good will. And then you're going to lay low for a while. You're not going to leave the state, because that's going to look worse for you, but maybe go visit your dad. I'll deal with Elijah. Sound fair?”

“Sounds fair,” Everett said. He disappeared into his room and came back. “Good will, like you said.”

He dropped a ziplock bag with some jewelry into Marvin's hands.

“Remember what I said. About looking suspicious? If this isn't everything, attention is going to fall right back on you.”

Everett hesitated. “Look man, I'm already out the money for the room-”

“And a murder charge is going to be a lot worse for your wallet than a night at the Scarsborough Motor Inn.”

“Jesus, Marvin, okay. Is it that bad?”

“It's that bad.”

He left and returned a second time with a gold chain and a watch. “That’s all of it, I swear. If she was missing anything else, she pawned it, it's not with me.”

“Thank you, Everett.”

“You'll move your car?”

“In a minute,” Marvin said affably. “Might have another couple of questions for you.”

We went to Aisha's room. It was clean, for a motel room that had seen better days. It was clear housekeeping had been in and turned down the room. Marvin looked in a couple drawers before saying, “Well this is a waste of fucking time.”

We went back out and Everett was still there. He had thrown all his stuff in the back of his car and was fidgeting with his keys. 

“Okay Everett, I got a couple questions and then you can go. I don't think you had anything to do with Aisha, but she's a good girl. Headed to college in the fall. If we don't find her, there's going to be some heat, you understand? So you gotta be transparent with me. If I think you're lying, if I find out you lied, I'm not going to help you, and I am what's standing between you and the AG, you understand?”

“Yep, yep, sure.” He looked visibly nervous. 

“Walk me through what happened. People have seen you running around with her.”

“Look man- it's not like that. She was just looking for some quick cash and wanted to say fuck you to her old man. I walked her through what she should take. What's valuable, what isn't, what's easy to get rid of. I gave you everything she gave me, probably worth a few grand. She said she needed a place to lay low until I could get her the money so I spotted her a room.”

“And then?”

“The last I fucking saw of her, man. I didn't want to be involved so I gave her the cash and she booked her own room. Next thing I know, she's gone.”

“What do you mean, gone?”

“Well I knocked on her door this morning to see if she needed anything, breakfast, whatever. She didn't have a car, I think that's what she needed the money for. I left to do my thing and when I came back the housekeepers were cleaning the room. They said it didn't even look like anyone had slept there.”

“That's it?” Marvin said.

“That's it.”

“All right,” Marvin said. “How did she seem? Upset at all?”

“No, normal, I guess. Kinda quiet but friendly enough.” 

Marvin had me pull the car into a regular spot. Everett peeled out of the parking lot.

“Should we just let him go like that?” I asked.

“He's not going to go far. He has a sick father in Whitney so he's not going to leave the state unless they put out a warrant for him. They wont do that unless they're fucking idiots – so I suppose they might, but that’s their problem.” He heaved a big sigh. “I hate cases like these.”

“Why?” I asked.

“We're not going to solve it. She's gone. She's not coming back.”

“How do you know that?” 

“Call it intuition. I don't know how a girl without a car gets too far, or even why she would leave the motel. It's not safe. There's naïve and then there's stupid, which this girl wasn't. If she hitchhiked from this dump, her odds aren't good. And if she took desperate measures like that, she's not likely to come back voluntarily.”

“You don't think Everett did something to her?”

“The thing about Everett is he's a coward. I'm not saying he would never hurt a woman, just if he did it's going to be one of the usual crowd and not a girl with family and prospects. And he's afraid of Elijah.”

We paid a call to Elijah. I don't think we were supposed to, as it was outside of our patrol area, and the detective on the case hadn't asked us to. But at the end of the shift Marvin asked, “Are you coming with me?” so we pulled up in the squad car outside Foreign Auto Repair. It was late so the shop was closed, but there were a few guys outside smoking cigarettes who eyed us. 

They made me nervous but Marvin said, “Jesus fucking Christ, kid. They're illegals, not cannibals,” and I made an effort to relax. 

“They look suspicious,” I said.

“Two cops just pulled up. Of course they're suspicious. Try not to look so much like you're about to draw your service weapon.”

So with that we headed inside. I looked around, wondering if I'd see evidence of a chop shop. I gathered Elijah must be a criminal if Everett associated with him.

“Elijah,” Marvin said. The biggest man I have ever seen had come out of a dingy office to greet us. I took an involuntary step back. He should have been playing in the NFL, not working in a shop. 

“Marvin.”

“This here is my partner, Jared.”

I gave an awkward half wave. 

Elijah snorted. “This about Aisha?”

“It's about Everett.” 

Elijah's expression darkened.

“He wasn't involved,” Marvin said quickly. “Well… He might have been the last person to see her, but no funny business. He gave me this as a token of goodwill.”

He tossed the bag of jewelry to Elijah. “What's this,” Elijah asked. “A bribe?”

“Ask your uncle.”

“That thieving little-” he stopped himself. “She's still missing?”

“Yeah,” Marvin said. “We got our top guys on it. Me, Jared, they even sent down a detective from the city.”

Elijah covered his face. “Fuck,” he said. “I should wring that little punk's neck anyway. He had no business messing with her. Should have come to me.”

“Well, look at it this way, if you try to prevent a girl at that age, she's just going to get what she wants in a different way. Sometimes the devil you know is better than the one you don't.”

“Sometimes the devil you know is still the devil.” Elijah punched the nearby pillar and then winced. He shook out his hand. “Is that what Everett told you?”

“No, more of a professional observation. Everett was doing his best. He's an idiot and a weasel but he wouldn't intentionally fuck you over.”

“Maybe.”

“Let me put it this way, I don't think he did anything to her, and maybe he's guilty of negligence and being a moron, but if you break his teeth it's going to draw attention away from the actual investigation.”

“But you're going to investigate?” Elijah said hopefully.

“She was a good girl from a good family. We're going to do everything we can. She was on the Motel Mile but that doesn't make her a Motel Mile girl. Just remember what I did for you here,” he said, with a nod to the baggie. “Buy yourself some favor with the old man. Family has to stick together in times like these.”

He turned and left, and I hurried after him. We got back in the car and Marvin let out a huge sigh, hands shaking.

“Goddamn mess. They don't pay me enough for this shit.”

“What… just happened? Did you just take the evidence of a crime and give it to another suspect?”

“Suspect. Ha. No. I did him a favor in exchange for not beating the living crap out of Everett, which was going to be a whole lot of paperwork.”

“A favor?”

“He can take the jewelry and return it to Aisha's father personally. He can swear up and down he didn't know, and that he beat up the asshole who was going to fence it. Won't bring Aisha back but it does keep Elijah from being excommunicated from the family. He's already the bastard criminal branch of it.”

“But why… would you do that for Elijah? …or Everett? And won't it come out at trial that you tampered with evidence?”

“I'll leave it for you to deduce, Mr. Detective. As for a trial - there won't be one. There's no evidence of a murder and they won't find any.”

“How do you know that?”

“I just know. Now shut up and be less annoying for a minute.”

The investigation and search for Aisha was lukewarm at best. The trail went completely cold at the Scarsborough. I figured she must have hitchhiked, or had a boyfriend come pick her up or something. It didn't make a whole lot of sense that she would leave all that money on the table, but if it were truly a fuck you to her parents, maybe it wasn't the money she was after.

After a little while longer on the force, I was truly in awe of Marvin's judgment. He didn't make mistakes in his assessment of people. He had a sixth sense when it came to knowing when they were lying. He had been a cop in this part of town for long enough that he knew all the players, their motivations, and the overall politics of the community, in particular the criminal elements. 

He also had a way of dealing with people that departed from what was strictly law enforcement. As we spent more time together I understood it was less about picking his battles and more about…something else. Not quite justice. Maybe peace? Setting things right according to his definition of it, even if it was outside of the law. He dealt with people in a way that was fair. And they responded to it, giving him information and respect.

We had a couple more odd cases, people going missing that made him say, “Goddamn it, I hate this job.” It happened seemingly at random. We'd have some requests to investigate where he seemed to make a good faith effort, but others where he didn't even really try. I couldn't spot the pattern.

I asked him once why he didn't want to become a detective. His people skills, while abrasive and unconventional, were incredibly effective. He had an unparalleled intuition for who he needed to talk to and when, and how to get them to talk. We saw a small fragment of investigations, being beat cops, and the ones we did see seemed more because Marvin knew how to handle people than because it was something patrol cops should be doing. It was a great learning experience for me. I saw him as essentially a detective who was stuck doing regular police work. 

“Stuck?” He snorted so hard he choked on a French fry and spent a whole minute coughing it back up. We had stopped for lunch. “Some detective skills you have there, Sherlock. No, I don't want the job, and I'm cheaper if they don't make me one. I do their job for them anyway.”

“How could you not want the job? Are you happy just being a patrol officer your whole life?”

“Did politeness die off with your generation? Jesus fucking Christ.”

I backpedaled. “I mean, it's a respectable job and all, but don't you ever want something more?”

“Not better. Being a detective isn't about finding fingerprints and putting together the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. It's talking to people and being good at it. A word of advice for you. You're smart, but you're off putting. You look like a skinhead and you act like a smug asshole, which is fine for a cop. Preferred, really. But if you want to be a good detective you need to be at least a little more likable. People have to *want* to tell you stuff.

“If we're done throwing insults around, I don't want to be a detective, no. The more questions you ask the more questions you uncover. There aren't answers, not really. Eventually you see enough and you don't need to see any more. Why do you want to be a detective, anyway?”

“It's always been my dream, you know, solving crimes. Getting to the truth.”

“I don't believe in the truth,” Marvin said.

“What do you mean…? It’s the truth? It's not up for debate.”

“That’s where you and I differ. Gravity is a fact, sure. The moon, whatever. But when it comes to the realm of human existence… there's just a series of levers and probabilities. There's never something as clear cut as a fact.”

“But say you find a murder weapon, with a suspects fingerprints on it and the blood of their victim.”

“Maybe they even did it,” Marvin said. “But did the other person have it coming?”

“Of course not, murder is a crime.”

“That's where you and I differ. The system fails, too consistently and too often, for me to be able to say. ”

“I think I see what you're saying. I need more perspective.”

“No, that's not what I'm saying at all.”

“Well, what are you saying?” I was starting to get a little mad.

“I'm saying I don't want to be a detective. Now drop it.”

We got another call that very afternoon. Marvin beat his head against the steering wheel. “I. Fucking. Hate. This. Job,” he said. Then he put the car in drive.

“What's wrong with this case?”

“What do you mean?” 

“It's another missing person and you already know we're not going to find them. How?”

“We have two different approaches to police work. You are Mr. Sherlock Holmes, so when a crime occurs, you work backwards from there, slotting in pieces that fit until you have a plausible explanation for how what did occur, could have occurred. Maybe even how it most likely could have occurred.”

“As opposed to?”

“I'm not a detective. I've just been at this job a long time. I've met a lot of folks. I understand what they do and do not do. And sometimes a case comes along, where the situation is such, that there is a series of events so improbable they are impossible. I mean, you could say, Jane got to the deserted island they found her on, by stealing a plane. Physically possible, sure. But Jane doesn't have a pilot's license. She doesn't, as far as anyone knows, fly planes. Maybe she took secret flying lessons. But there's no paper trail. Maybe she was a secret gambler and paid under the table, with her winnings. All possible, none *that* hard to believe on their own, but as a collection it’s just so far out of what is likely for a middle aged nurse and mother of two to do, that it's impossible, from a probability standpoint. Every now and then a case comes along and you can just see it from a mile away. It doesn't add up. And we've never once solved one of those cases. So what we're really doing is damage control disguised as a legitimate investigation.”

“People go missing all the time and turn up.”

“Not Randy Wilson,” he said darkly. “Not in a motel.”

The Danvers Motel was the nicest of the several motels on the strip, and catered the most often to legitimate travelers. Or Marvin said, to locals having affairs. 

The clerk at the desk was therefore very tight lipped when we started asking questions. Marvin asked to speak to the manager, who wasn't in. He said he was going to call the owner and suddenly the manager was running from the back office. 

“Sorry about that, just got in,” he said breathlessly. “How can I help you, officers?” He looked at me. 

“This is Jared,” Marvin said. “He's all right. I'm supposed to ask you about Randy Wilson.”

“I don't think we have a guest by that name staying here,” he said.

“Well, that's inconvenient,” Marvin said. “The boys wanted to get a warrant but I said you were sensible and would let us take a look at the guest list. He's not wanted for anything, he's a missing person. The family is very concerned, time is of the essence, you know how it is, Paul.”

“Why don't you let me check? I don't know everyone who's been here the last few days.”

“Sure thing,” Marvin said. 

Paul came back with a note. “We had a Wilson on the register. Paid in cash. Left this morning.”

“Checked out or just left?”

“Well - he just left actually. The key is missing.”

“That's what I thought,” Marvin said.

“Those cameras work?” I interjected. There were security cameras above the desk. I thought I had seen one outside as well. It probably captured Randy coming and if we were lucky would have also caught him going.

“I'm sorry, but you are going to need a warrant for those,” Paul said.

“I understand,” Marvin interjected. “We'll get the boys working on it but it will probably be a few days before we come back. Thank you for your help, Paul, I always appreciate it.”

We left. 

“Don't you want to see what's on those cameras?”

“I already know,” Marvin said. “Probably won some brownie points with Paul warning him like that, though, smart.”

“I –” I hadn't intended the question as a warning, but it was my first compliment from Marvin so I let it go. “Do you think we'll see him on there, then?”

“No.”

Marvin didn't seem inclined to elaborate, but I couldn't stand it. “Marvin, what the hell is going on?”

“I don't know,” he said. “And I don't think I ever will.” He clammed up and I couldn't get him to elaborate any further.

I did some searching on my own. There are a lot of people reported missing every year. 75% of them are found right away. 24% are found eventually. 1% of them are never found. I had access to the police database, so I printed off a list of every missing persons case in our area in the last decade that was unresolved. At first I was looking at suspicious circumstances, but I realized Aisha Baker running away made her circumstances less suspicious. So I widened my net again. I circled all the cases that had made Marvin upset. There wasn't a clear correlation between them. Age, race, socioeconomic background, all varied. All reported last seen at a motel. 

I asked Marvin the next day what they all had in common. He looked at my list and said, “Not bad, rookie. Some actual police work.”

“How do you know if a missing persons case is unusual? That it won't be solved?”

“Just a feeling,” Marvin said.

“What kind of feeling?”

“Well, if you dig into them, it's usually a person who has no business being at a motel. A girl like Aisha Baker, she had friends, she had money. Hell, she had Elijah. She had no business rolling with Everett, to a motel of all places.”

“She couldn't have pawned her dad's stuff through Elijah. “

“No, but she didn't pawn anything, did she? She disappeared before he could move the goods.”

“Well that's if she up and left. If something happened to her-” 

“You're not wrong. It's a reasonable assumption, if you assume her end goal was to leave home, and disappearing was a side effect. But what if it wasn't?”

“Randy Wilson, then. How do we know he didn’t skip town?”

“The proof’s in the pudding. It's hard to permanently disappear these days, especially when you don’t have two nickels to rub together. But they're never going to find him.”

“Why not? What do you know that I don't?”

“If I show you, will you stop asking so many goddamn questions?”

I agreed easily.

Marvin instructed me to come pick him up on our day off. So I did. He asked me to drive him to a motel.

“Are we doing a reenactment of the crime, or…?”

“Just drop me off, will you?”

“And then what?”

“And then go home.”

“Are you serious?”

“Yeah, I needed a ride.”

“You have a perfectly good– you know what, never mind. Fine,” I said, peeved. I decided to just leave him at the motel with no way to get home. It would serve him right. 

I dropped him off and peeled out before he was even inside. He texted me a few seconds later.

*Come back*

*This a joke?* I wrote back, pissed. 

*No*

I was angry but I turned the car around.

Marvin was outside, holding a door cracked open. I parked and leapt out, ready to yell at him for wasting my time on a ridiculous prank on my day off, but he looked at me with wide eyes and waved me over. He put a finger to his lips. I'd never seen Marvin scared before. No matter where he was he always seemed in his element. Cranky, but in his element.

I walked over cautiously, my hand on my firearm. 

He cracked the door open a little farther. It was dark, pitch dark. At first I thought the blinds were closed, but I realized crappy motel blinds were never totally blackout like this. The gap in the door wasn't casting any light into the room. As my eyes adjusted to the light level, which was actually only very dark, not completely pitch black, I began to pick out shapes in the room. I then realized they were moving.

“Marvin, what the fuck-”

He closed the door. 

“No noises with them. Don’t make too much noise.” 

“With who? Who's in there?”

“Nobody,” he said, and opened the door. It was just a normal room. Queen bed, navy blue carpet, not well lit but definitely not pitch black. It was empty. It also seemed much smaller than it had just a moment ago. I had a bout of severe vertigo and my butt hit the curb. 

Marvin took pity on me and drove me to a cafe. “Coffee helps,” he said.

I gulped down some of the scalding coffee and I did feel a little better.

“What was that?”

“I don't know.” 

“I'm serious, what was that?”

“I don't know,” he repeated. “I call it the nowhere.”

“And it just… shows up?”

“Sometimes. If certain conditions are met. You have to be looking for it.”

“Why would anyone be looking for that? It's awful.”

“I wonder that myself, sometimes.”

“How did you… did they… is that where…?” I was floundering. My description doesn’t do it justice. I only saw it for a moment but it was deeply unsettling. Marvin took pity on me at last. “Welcome to the club, kid,” he said. “That's why I don't ever want to be a detective. You have to ask all kinds of questions like, “why” and “how” but there's no explaining the nowhere. It's best if you can forget it entirely but… You start seeing cases and they just have nowhere written all over them. You can't unsee it.”

“But what is it?” I asked plaintively.

“Don't know. I think it's a place. But you don't come out if you go in.”

“And people go there?”

“Sometimes.”

“Why?”

“It's a certain type of person. With a certain type of psyche. The kind of person who has nothing left. If you have nothing, nowhere seems pretty appealing, don't you think?”

“Maybe…” I said. “But Aisha Baker didn't have nothing…”

“She was a teenager. Everything is a matter of life and death with them. Isaiah Baker is a piece of work besides. She went to that motel knowing what she would find.”

“Well?” I asked.

“What.”

“How did she know?”

“No idea. I'm not a detective.” Marvin was back in Marvin form.

“You have to know something,” I said. “You know too much to not know something.”

“How she learned about it, no idea. However kids learn about shit they're too young to know about. Probably TikTok or something.”

“How do you know about it?”

“Somebody showed me. Some people, kids especially, if they open a door they have to walk through it. No impulse control. Some people though, they take their time. They open the door three or five or ten times before they're ready. And the whole time they have the knowledge in their pocket like a hundred dollar bill, burning a hole until they show someone.”

“Who showed you?”

“A friend.”

He seemed reluctant to share more on that front so I changed tactics. “Why did they show you?”

“They thought I was like them. Ready to open a door and walk into oblivion, if it would have me.”

“But you weren't. You didn't go.”

“No.”

“So what, if you show up at a motel sometimes it's a portal to hell? How has no one else discovered this?”

“You have to be in a certain frame of mind. You have to have no place else to go. You have to make a one way trip to a hotel or motel. I wasn’t sure you were going to turn around and come back for me, which would have left me stranded. 

“You have to really want it. Most people who stumble on it are already halfway gone. The other half isn't going to bother them so much. But that's the thing about stepping out of your life. You can do it at any time. The thing that lives inside motels… that's different. It's like… you can get swallowed up by something that's larger than yourself. Some people want that. Suicide is too messy or too empty.”

“What happened to you, Marvin?”

“None of your business.”

I had asked the wrong question and he clammed up entirely. I didn't have the courage to ask him anything else for another few days. He was more irate than normal.

I dug into some of the missing people. I tried to understand where they were in their lives, before they left them. A few loved ones thanked me in earnest for reviewing their cold case. I told them not to get their hopes up. A couple of families said they knew the person wasn't still alive, but they wanted closure. They wanted their remains. 

I asked around a little, but there was not a whole lot about Aisha. I gave Elijah a wide berth. Her father Isaiah was a very religious man. Strict, some might say overbearing. Aisha was a straight A student, did well at sports, the class treasurer. 

Randy was easier to clock. His friends reported he seemed depressed and withdrawn for a long time before his disappearance. He was recently fired from his job, because he had fallen off the wagon. He left very little behind. He wasn't married, no kids, not much money to speak of.

I started reading through police reports. Suspected suicide, assumed runaway, any sort of personal disturbances prior to disappearing all seemed like a good bet. The list continued to shrink as I crossed out anyone who didn't fit the profile.

I showed it to Marvin again. He said it looked pretty good. He even took out a pen and crossed out a couple names for me, but circled a few I had crossed out. “Check again,” he said. 

“How could you possibly know?”

“I just know,” he said.

We had spent about a year and a half on the force together, and around that time Marvin became a little more erratic. He was more impatient with people. Occasionally hostile. We got another call to ask about a missing persons case and he got written up for insubordination because he refused to go. In my county, detective is a lateral move in terms of rank. You get paid more, and you're on a different track, but you don't actually outrank your fellow officers. So a detective wrote him up for not doing what he asked, but he took it to the union, who ruled the detective wasn't actually allowed to issue him orders and write him up, and our supervisor wasn't inclined to enforce the order, because Marvin was, well, Marvin. So it got dropped. But it was the first time I had seen him do such a thing, and gave me a clue as to why he had never made detective. The write up didn't get attached to his record, but if you do that a few times people tend to leave you to your own devices. 

I asked him about it. He said he wasn't going to waste his time, and he was tired of lying to families that there was hope for their missing loved one. Daniel Alma was not going to be found.

Marvin started to drink copious amounts of coffee. He had a cup in his hand at all times. We were making more frequent stops at the convenience store and donut shop. 

I mentioned it to him and he just snapped that I should mind my own business.

I continued my investigation of the missing persons list. Daniel was added, of course. The interesting thing someone mentioned to me was he had been attending AA meetings. So had Randy before he fell off the wagon.

I dropped by just to see what they were about. I mean, I knew what they were about, but I had never been to one and I didn't really know what happened at them. I dropped by one at the local rec center after work, one that Daniel used to go to.

To my shock and embarrassment, Marvin was there. I was torn between fleeing immediately, or sitting through and trying to remain inconspicuous. I took a seat near the back and sat low in my chair. I put a couple dollars in when they passed the plate around, my face hot. I caught Marvin looking at me once, by which point it was far too late to leave. I sat through a few people's stories and then it was time to go.

I nearly ran for exit. 

To my deep embarrassment, Marvin mentioned it. He didn't say much, just that if I ever needed to talk, he had been through it all before, as we cruised in the squad car. I hid my face in my hands. It was the kindest he'd ever been. He patted me on the shoulder and said it was nothing to be ashamed of, AA was probably the least embarrassing part of the whole thing.

I stuttered out an explanation - it was the missing persons list, Daniel Alba - I don't know exactly what I said. But Marvin deflated like a balloon.

It was around this time I started having nightmares. I'd open a door and the darkness would be there. I'd slam the door and turn around, but when I'd look back it would be open again. I'd have sleep paralysis episodes where I thought the shapes from the nowhere were crawling from beneath my bed or out from my closet.

I joined Martin in his compulsive coffee habit. “Do you have nightmares about the nowhere?” I asked him.

I caught him off guard. “No,” he said. “I have nightmares about everything else.”

“What do you mean?”

But he went quiet and stonewalled me again.

He did that a lot more in those days. When we first started working together, he was grouchy and would snap at me, but would usually unwind enough to answer my questions eventually. But later - after Daniel Alba and the incident at AA - he was just as likely to stop talking to me about anything not strictly patrol related for the rest of the shift.

I can see now we were on a downward spiral. I wonder, though, if I could have done more to help Marvin. To save him.

I showed up to the station one day. Marvin wasn't there. I asked around if he called out, but he hadn't. It wasn't like him to just not show up.

With a sick sense of dread I hopped in our car, alone. I called a couple of the motels on the Motel Mile until I talked to someone who said they'd seen him, not more than a minute ago. I flicked on my lights and sped through every stoplight to get there, praying that I wasn't too late.

I was; and I wasn't. I wish every day I had been just a few minutes earlier. I wish also, failing that, I had been just a minute later. Although I try not to admit that to myself most of the time. 

But I wasn't too early or too late. I arrived, in the nature of things, at the exact moment. With the lights going, I saw the black rectangle of the open door as I was pulling up. I skidded to a halt, threw the car into park, and leapt out, shouting after Marvin, “Don't, don't!” Marvin was wavering, not in resolve, but physically wavering as he stood in the doorway. He took an unsteady step forward, and then he was gone. I took a few sprinted steps after him and then realizing I wouldn't make it in time, I dove, wedging the door open with my fingertips as it threatened to close after him. I lay silently, remembering his warning. I was on the ground, looking back at the flashing lights. I had scared the motel patrons into their dens for the night, and they were unlikely to wander out as long as the lights were still going. My phone, stupidly, was still sitting in the center console of the car where I had dropped it. I couldn't call for help. I lay for a moment, pointedly not looking into the abyss that I held pried open with my hand. I noticed the abandoned liquor bottle on the curb. I didn't know how long Marvin would last in there on his own, so I couldn’t wait until the station tried to radio me.

So I did what any idiot would do. I got up, took a deep breath, and I stepped inside.

We’ve done a lot of research, but seem to find conflicting messages. Any help from recent lodge visitors much appreciated.

Cafe: Is there a cafe that anyone could rely upon for a snack or small meal? 

Store: I read that the store is hit or miss, and very unlikely to have what you need. Got it!

That being said, we assume we should bring in what we would need to eat for the full 4 days/3 nights, even if we are not camping, correct?

Do the rooms have a refrigerator?

Do the rooms have a microwave?

Does the lodge have ice?

Does the lodge have coffee?

Given we are not camping, we are not planning to bring outdoor cooking equipment.  If we have access to a refrigerator/microwave, it would change what we bring in terms of food.

[Breville Barista Express Impress],"Hi, I just picked up the Breville Barista Express Impress. I’ve been “dialing in” the machine. My question is regarding the yield/amount of espresso being brewed. When I pull a shot WITHOUT coffee (just water thru the portafilter), I get substantially more water than I get when I pull an actual shot WITH coffee. I haven’t changed any default settings yet on the machine other than grind size. This machine has an assisted tamper and a pressure gauge that apparently provides one with a general guide as to whether the shot is being pulled within a “good” espresso range. My dialing in has involved trying to get the gauge in the recommended pressure range so the grinder has been dialed down to 4. Maybe this is a more general question rather than machine specific.. but is it normal that most of the water is being absorbed by the coffee grounds? When I pull a single shot there is maybe a teaspoon of espresso yield. A double shot yield from the Breville is closer to what I “pulled” on my original line Nespresso machine, which is what I’m familiar with. Any thoughts in terms of dialing in this specific machine? Does it make sense that the shots from the Breville are considerably smaller than the Nespresso? I know they are two very different machines. Thank you.",1,1749425560.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

1l6q54p,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1l6q54p/how_i_went_from_productive_to_actually_getting/,"How I went from ""productive"" to actually getting shit done (6 months of trial & error)","spent the first half of 2024 thinking i was productive bc i had color-coded calendars and 7 different apps. turns out being ""busy"" and getting important stuff done are completely different things. finally cracked the code and actually get meaningful work done now. here's what actually moved the needle:

the foundation stuff (boring but essential):

* started planning only 3 things per day instead of 15. sounds too simple but ur brain can only handle so much decision-making before it taps out
* bought a physical timer (not phone timer). something about the ticking keeps me honest. work for 90 mins, break for 15. repeat
* moved my phone to another room during work blocks. ""airplane mode"" is for weaklings, physical distance is the only thing that works
* started doing weekly reviews every sunday. 20 mins to figure out what worked, what didn't, and what to focus on next week

the energy management stuff:

* tracked my energy levels every hour for 2 weeks like some kind of data nerd. turns out i'm sharp during  9-11am and 2-4pm, braindead after 6pm. now i schedule hard work during those windows
* switched from trying to ""power through"" low energy to doing admin stuff instead. email, organizing, planning which save the brain work for when ur brain actually works
* started eating lunch away from my desk. sounds dumb but coming back feels like starting fresh instead of continuing the same energy drain
* got blackout curtains + wake up light. sleep quality went from garbage to good.

**t**he weird psychology hacks:

* started keeping a ""done list"" alongside my to-do list. at the end of each day i write down everything i accomplished. brain needs to see progress to stay motivated
* made a ""time cost"" spreadsheet. netflix = $0 but costs 2 hours. going to gym = $20 but saves 2 hours of feeling like trash. helps me make better decisions
* started batch processing similar tasks. all emails at once, all calls at once, all creative work at once. context switching is productivity cancer
* created ""implementation intentions"" - instead of ""i'll work out"" its ""when i finish my morning coffee, i'll change into gym clothes""

the environment stuff:

* cleaned my workspace completely. not just organized - actually clean. dirty space = cluttered brain (apparently)
* got a separate computer/account just for work. no reddit, no youtube, no random bookmarks. just work stuff
* started using website blockers during work hours. not during breaks, just during actual work time. helps with the ""just one quick check"" impulse
* bought a good chair and monitor setup. being uncomfortable kills productivity faster than anything else

the counterintuitive stuff:

* stopped trying to eliminate all distractions and started scheduling them instead. 15 mins of reddit at 11am, 15 mins at 3pm. brain stops craving it when it knows it's coming
* started saying no to 80% of requests/meetings/opportunities. focus = doing fewer things better, not more things worse
* began treating energy like money, i started to budget it, don't waste it, invest it wisely. some days i ""spend"" energy on work, other days on relationships or health
* learned the difference between ""urgent"" and ""important"". urgent feels stressful, important actually matters. most urgent stuff can wait

the mindset shifts that actually stuck:

* motivation is unreliable, systems are everything. build processes that work even when u don't feel like it
* perfectionism is just procrastination in disguise ""good enough"" beats ""perfect"".
* comparison is productivity poison. focus on ur own progress, not what other people are doing
* also stop trying to beat yourself up every time you mess up. just keep trying

after 6 months i work fewer hours but get more meaningful stuff done. actually have time for friends, hobbies, and not feeling like a stressed robot. well the secret was actually do less stuff but do what matters

She got engaged to her bf of 3 years and then asked me if I would be her maid of honor. I said yes and haven’t heard anything else about wedding planning. 

Recently I discovered through a mutual friend (Kay) that she has been keeping a lot of her life a secret from me. For back ground Kay, who I discovered this from is someone I met through my job of a couple of years now. Kay and I are both managers now at this job. About a year ago Emma needed a job and I got her on at my place of work. For the most part it’s been fine. 

Kay and I were hanging out to get some drinks after work on day. Just us two nothing new. When she starts telling me about Emma’s new home… I was confused and asked Kay what she was talking about. Kay explains that Emma and her fiancé got a new house but haven’t moved into it yet due to renovations needed and when Kay realized I had no clue what she was talking about we both sat there confused because I talk to Emma daily, not just at work. We go home and play video games with each other most nights and text constantly everyday and nothing ever seems off. 

But Emma has never once mentioned to me anything about this house. Kay then shows me messages from Emma showing photos of the house, paperwork from the loan stuff, photo ideas for what she wants the home to look like. I then ask if Emma has mentioned to Kay anything about her wedding and that’s when Kay shows me venues Emma has visited and sent her. 

The thing is Kay isn’t a brides maid and I’m suppose to be her maid of honor. If she’s changed her mind on having me as that, that’s fine, just I’d like a heads up. It’s just sooo strange to me that she’s not mentioning any of this too me? But sits there on calls with me talking about tv shows and sending me photos of other things she’s doing like little things… new coffee shops, tj maxx hauls. 

It kinda doesn’t sit right with me? We’re each others longest friend. We’ve been there for each other through a lot and I can’t figure out why she would hide these things from me? There good things? And I’m happy for her.. it’s left me feeling weird and seeing her differently. 

The only thing I can come up with as to why Emma is doing this is Kay mentioned to me how Emma is jealous of my position at work and she is hoping for a manager position but Kay admitted our boss won’t give her the position for reasons. And Kay thinks I shouldn’t mention it to her that I know because she doesn’t want me too so keep it that way. 

But that’s not my fault? I’ve been working for that company YEARS longer and I feel that can’t truly be why she’s seemingly being on good terms with me but hiding all these good and BIG things happening in life? ",1,1749425369.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

## key Features Analysis

The best 1000 watt power inverters boast several crucial features that determine their performance, reliability, and suitability for various applications.**Continuous Power Output:** It is indeed the most critical specification of a power inverter, the continuous power output determines how much load the inverter can handle consistently. A 1000 watt power inverter should deliver close to 1000 watts of continuous power to reliably run appliances without overheating or shutting down. Users should always verify the manufacturer's specifications and read user reviews to confirm the inverter's ability to maintain its rated power output under real-world conditions.

**Surge Capacity:** While continuous power deals with the sustained load, surge capacity refers to the inverter's ability to handle momentary power spikes that occur when certain devices, like refrigerators or power tools, initially start. A good 1000 watt power inverter should have a surge capacity considerably higher than its continuous rating, typically around 2000 watts, to accommodate these startup surges without tripping the overload protection.

**Waveform Type:** Power inverters generate either a pure sine wave or a modified sine wave. Pure sine wave inverters produce power that’s virtually identical to grid power and is suitable for sensitive electronics like laptops, audio equipment, and medical devices. Modified sine wave inverters are more affordable but may not work well with all devices, potentially causing buzzing noises, overheating, or even damage. The choice depends on the user's needs and the types of devices they'll be powering.

**Safety Features:** A reliable power inverter should incorporate multiple safety features. Overload protection is crucial to prevent damage to the inverter itself and the connected devices. Short circuit protection safeguards against damaging electrical faults. Over-temperature protection shuts down the inverter if it gets too hot, preventing overheating and potential fire hazards. Low voltage protection prevents excessive battery drain by shutting off the inverter when the battery voltage drops to a critical level.Key features of a 1000 watt power inverter include:

*   Reliable surge protection
*   High power conversion efficiency
*   Multiple AC outlets and USB ports
*   Durable construction

1. La capacidad de autocurarse

Estudios del Instituto Wyss de Harvard han demostrado que el cuerpo humano tiene una asombrosa capacidad de regeneración. Desde la cicatrización de heridas hasta la reparación de órganos, nuestro sistema biológico está diseñado para sanarse.



Ejemplo: Joe Dispenza, doctor en neurociencia, documentó casos de pacientes que lograron remisiones espontáneas de enfermedades graves mediante meditación y reprogramación mental, demostrando el poder de la mente sobre el cuerpo, propósito que puedes alcanzar al entrenar con los audios para una [**MEDITACIÓN PROFUNDA**](https://www.todopoder.com/visitar/meditacionprofunda.htm).



2. La fuerza sobrehumana en momentos de crisis

¿Alguna vez has escuchado historias de personas que levantaron autos para salvar a alguien? Esto se debe al fenómeno llamado ""fuerza histérica"", estudiado por la Universidad de Southern California. En situaciones extremas, el cerebro libera una descarga de adrenalina que permite usar el 100% de nuestra capacidad muscular (normalmente usamos solo el 65%).



Ejemplo: En 2019, un adolescente en Ohio levantó un tractor que aplastaba a su padre, algo imposible en condiciones normales. Los médicos confirmaron que fue un caso clásico de este fenómeno.



3. El reloj biológico que predice el futuro

Investigadores de la Universidad Northwestern descubrieron que el cuerpo tiene un ""sexto sentido"" biológico. Nuestros órganos internos, especialmente el corazón y el intestino, envían señales de alerta antes de que ocurra algo peligroso, gracias a una red neuronal independiente del cerebro.



Ejemplo: Alex Honnold, el famoso escalador que ascendió El Capitán sin cuerdas, confesó que su cuerpo le advertía con señales físicas (como sudor frío o latidos acelerados) cuando un movimiento era riesgoso, incluso antes de que su mente lo procesara.



4. El poder de la memoria celular

La ciencia de la epigenética (estudiada en el Instituto Karolinska) revela que nuestras células guardan recuerdos de experiencias traumáticas o felices, y estos pueden afectar nuestra salud años después. Lo increíble es que podemos ""reprogramar"" estas memorias con terapias mente-cuerpo.



Ejemplo: Dr. Bruce Lipton, biólogo celular, demostró que el cambio de creencias puede alterar la expresión genética, curando enfermedades vinculadas al estrés.



5. La capacidad de controlar el dolor con la mente

Monjes tibetanos y yoguis han demostrado en laboratorios de la Universidad de Wisconsin que pueden reducir su percepción del dolor hasta en un 50% mediante [**MEDITACIÓN**](https://www.todopoder.com/visitar/meditacionprofunda.htm). Esto se debe a que el cerebro produce opioides naturales más potentes que la morfina.



Ejemplo: Wim Hof, conocido como ""El Hombre de Hielo"", escaló el Everest en shorts y resiste temperaturas bajo cero gracias a su técnica de respiración que controla el sistema nervioso.



6. El súper aprendizaje durante el sueño

Neurocientíficos de la Universidad de Berna comprobaron que durante la fase REM del sueño, el cerebro repite lo aprendido en el día, mejorando la memoria en un 40%. ¡Dormir es literalmente estudiar!



Ejemplo: Michelle Mack, una estudiante universitaria, mejoró sus calificaciones significativamente al aplicar técnicas de sueño consciente para fijar información.



7. La habilidad de rejuvenecer células

El Premio Nobel de Medicina 2016 fue para Yoshinori Ohsumi por descubrir el ""autofagia"" - proceso donde las células se comen a sí mismas para eliminar lo dañado y [**REJUVENECER**](https://www.todopoder.com/visitar/rejuvenecer.htm). Con ayunos intermitentes y ejercicio, podemos activar este poder.



Ejemplo: Dave Asprey, creador del Bulletproof Coffee, revirtió su envejecimiento celular usando estos principios, bajando su edad biológica 20 años.



Eres más poderoso de lo que imaginas

Como dijo el filósofo Platón: ""La mayor victoria es conquistarse a sí mismo"". Tu cuerpo no es solo carne y huesos; es un universo de potencial esperando ser explorado.



El primer paso para activar estos superpoderes es creer que existen.

Yesterday I was feeling great, even had coffee in the morning, ran errands and even went to gym to lift weights and had a great workout. Very close to normal.



But being the idiot I am went to friends party and started drinking at 8pm and had 7-8 drinks for a nice buzz. Worse is I come home at 12 and continued drinking hard till 230 am.

**The Dawn of a Nomadic Day**

Every sunrise is a new story. Nomads don’t just wake up—they wake up somewhere. The world is their alarm clock, and the first light filters through unfamiliar curtains, or maybe none at all. The day begins with a stretch, a yawn, and a quick check of the Wi-Fi signal. Priorities, right? The morning air hums with possibility, and the nomad’s mind is already mapping out the day’s adventure.

**Morning Rituals: Between Coffee and Connectivity**

Coffee is the nomad’s universal currency. Whether it’s a hammock in Bali or a balcony in Barcelona, the ritual is sacred. But it’s not just about caffeine—it’s about connection. Emails flicker to life, Slack pings with urgency, and the world starts spinning. The nomad’s morning is a delicate dance between solitude and synchronicity, between the local and the global.

**The Workspace: Anywhere, Anytime**

Desks are optional. Nomads transform cafés, libraries, parks, and even beaches into impromptu offices. The only constant is change—and a reliable hotspot. The workspace is a state of mind, not a fixed location. The nomad thrives in the in-between, where inspiration is just a power outlet away.

Sleep is sacred. Hostels, Airbnbs, boutique hotels, or even a friend’s couch. The nomad’s bed changes, but the need for rest doesn’t. Comfort is relative, but a good night’s sleep is priceless.

**Challenges: Loneliness, Logistics, and Laptops**

The nomadic life isn’t all sunsets and smoothies. Loneliness lurks, logistics frustrate, and laptops crash. The nomad faces these challenges head-on, armed with resilience and resourcefulness. The road is tough, but the rewards are real.

**Rewards: Freedom, Flexibility, and Fulfillment**

Freedom is the ultimate reward. The nomad lives life on their terms, unshackled by routine. Flexibility is power. Fulfillment comes from experiences, not possessions. The world is the nomad’s playground.

**Nomadic Mindset: Adapt or Die**

The nomadic mindset is adaptability. Change is the only constant. The nomad thrives in uncertainty, finds joy in the unknown. To adapt is to survive—and to flourish.

She had written a script for a story that was an absolute joy to read, and was an amazing cook that blew my mind with the flavors she let us taste. She was our everything.

I need to get this off my chest for a moment. I'd do anything to lift my heart out of this sunken spot.

Me and my boyfriend are polyamorous, and almost two years ago, I received a message from someone, about an hour away, on a dating app that quickly turned from a small flirt, to a full on mutual desire to meet and do more than that.

Come to 11/21/2023, where she visited us, and we quickly realized that we wanted to be together, and I asked her out, which proceeded into dates to a coffee shop I've never been to, to other restaurants we experimented with, and even going to a soccer game together that I never thought I'd ever be interested in. She made these moments so worth it.

Everything was bright. Bright as day, with a year passing by where we could see each other at least once a month if our schedules lined up. I dreamed of giving her the world, and wanting her to experience it with us. When I introduced her to our boyfriend, he loved her, and we were at peace knowing that what we had was some of the most heartwarming love we could ever share.

Things were wonderful, until they turned scary. Earlier this year, while she had visited and stayed the night, boyfriend and I woke up to her having a seizure in our bed. Her first ever seizure, which led to her being hospitalized and tested on to see what the cause was. According to her mother, she had sleep apnea, which we all concluded as the cause of her seizure, being that she could have had bad sleep without her CPAP mask (which is broken, and needed to be repaired.)

EKG readings didn't show anything, her mother assumed because she wasn't actively having a seizure, and MRI machines couldn't fit her, so she was going in for a follow up appointment later this month.

But before that month, boyfriend and I received the news through a phone call with her mother, a sudden one, that she had passed away. We hadn't heard from her in two days beforehand (we text each other every day to make sure we all have a good day) and were hoping she had been very busy with something and not a worse scenario. Unfortunately, the latter happened, and she had another seizure alone in her house. No one there to help her, hear her, or save her. Her mother went into her room to see her unconscious, not breathing, with her face in her pillow unable to take air in.

Now, here we are, with me, boyfriend, and her family absolutely devastated. I had never expected this. I had expected to be there for her, to help her when this happens again. But now, we're sitting here, shocked, disturbed, and with our hearts sunken.

I can't help but feel this ache, this regret, that I wasn't able to see her for her final moments. That I wasn't able to give her a good night text beforehand. That I wasn't able to wish her farewell. It's been the most difficult thing in the world to accept that she's gone. I feel so guilty, where had I known this would happen, I would give the world to be there to aid in her final moments.

I look back now at these photos, and through all our texts, to hope that she went with peace, knowing that we loved her more than she could ever fathom. I would give the world to bring her back, and to know that she knew our hearts were with her.

Thank you for allowing me to speak this. I wish that everyone in the world could be able to experience the joy that she made us feel. I wish that everyone in the world could be able to listen to her stories, her rants, what she loved and cherished, and just... her.

As I sit here, typing this out, I am struggling mentally to come to terms with this. It's the most difficult thing in the world to wake up knowing that our baby won't be there the next day, but while I can't see her body in front of me, I know that her spirit and soul is still with us. She pushed me to be a stronger person than I was before, and knew that I had the strength to do anything.

I sit here, with this plush that she gave me on her second visit ever over here, holding it to me and knowing that she would want to see me push through, and that as long as I'm happy, she's happy. I'm going to be strong, and make her proud.

We love her so much. Rest in peace, our pumpkin.

1l6pr1x,http://www.drinkxol.com,"Cacao Contains the “Bliss Molecule” — And Yes, It’s Real","You ever wonder why a good cup of ceremonial cacao just feels different?

It’s not just placebo — it’s anandamide, a neurotransmitter nicknamed the bliss molecule. 🧬

⸻

Here’s what makes it special:

1. It’s naturally produced in your brain — but cacao contains it too, along with compounds that slow its breakdown, making the feeling last longer.

2. Anandamide = “ananda” in Sanskrit = bliss
This isn’t caffeine-fueled hyperproductivity. It’s calm focus. A lifted mood. That slight euphoric vibe you can’t quite describe.

3. It works synergistically with theobromine, magnesium, and PEA (another mood-enhancing compound in cacao), creating what some call a “heart-opening” effect.

⸻

This is why cacao was used in sacred rituals, fasts, and ceremonies.
And why I’ve replaced coffee with cacao — not just for energy, but for how it makes me feel.

No crash. No jittery spiral. Just clean, clear energy — and a better mood.

☀️ Curious? Ask me anything.

1l6ppz7,https://i.redd.it/9b81g4gscs5f1.jpeg,Why Theobromine (from Cacao) Might Be Better Than Caffeine for Your Brain and Body,"I recently made the switch from coffee to ceremonial cacao — and I haven’t looked back.

The secret? Theobromine, the primary active compound in cacao. It’s often overlooked, but here’s why it might actually be superior to caffeine:

⸻

1. No Jitters, No Crash ⚡
Theobromine stimulates the central nervous system more gently than caffeine. You still get a boost — but it’s smooth, not spiky. No anxiety. No post-lunch slump.

⸻

2. Longer-Lasting Energy 🔋
It has a longer half-life than caffeine. That means it sticks around without the rollercoaster. Great for focus, workouts, or fasting windows.

⸻

3. Heart-Friendly ❤️
It acts as a vasodilator, helping blood vessels relax and improving circulation. Some early research even links it to better cardiovascular health than caffeine.

⸻

4. Mood Support 😊
Cacao also contains anandamide (the “bliss molecule”) and phenylethylamine (PEA, the “love molecule”). Combined with theobromine, it’s a natural mood booster without the crash-and-burn.

⸻

5. Less Addictive, Easier on the Adrenals 💥
Unlike caffeine, theobromine doesn’t heavily tax your adrenal system. That makes it easier to use daily without wrecking your sleep or causing withdrawal.

⸻

If you’ve been thinking of cutting back on coffee or just want a smarter, cleaner pick-me-up, cacao is worth a shot.

Ask me anything — happy to share how I prepare it and why it’s helped me drop 20 lbs, feel better, and stay consistent with workouts and fasting.

Posting a few pics of our kitchen — we love it, but it's definitely lacking in storage and could use a bit more of a homey feel. We're struggling to find ways to make it both practical and cosy yet not overcrowded.

The coffee bar is from the Lloyd mango wood collection at Next. I considered adding the medium sideboard along that same wall from the same range for extra storage, but I'm not sure it would look right with the space. The table is also mango wood, so l'm trying to keep things somewhat coordinated.

Would love your ideas on how to:
• Add more storage
• Suggest what type of storage and where to place it 
- Make the space feel warmer/more lived-in

For context im from cuba. In my country coffee is a big part of the culture so everyone drinks cuban coffee at least 3 times a day as a form of interaction. The problem with cuban coffee is that is really really strong. But i never liked it, so i embarked in my espresso journey trying to find what i really like. And after two months of constant learning everything, espresso machines, grinders, portafilters, coffee roasting, everything. More than 150hours of youtube and practice.  I realized i don't know how to test good coffee. All coffees feel the same to me, doesn't matter if i grind them, bought them already grinded, use a pressurized basket or a bottomless portafilter. Nothing matters. Coffee still tastes bad to me. Meanwhile if i go to my local coffee shop i can taste that is super delicious but idk why. 
How do i train my mouth to understand coffee. Maybe is a rant, but can be that my taste buds are burnt from drinking cuban coffee all the time?. Or maybe i just suck. Can be that my grinder is a 20$ grinder? Or tht i store my beans in a completely closed storage? How do i taste the notes of the coffee or learn how to understand if my coffee has body or not. All those fine details that the youtubers talk, blend to me into nothing when i drip my cup. I'm kooked guys, idk where to go and what to do.",9,1749424130.0,espresso,38,0.8,False

So let’s crank that to 11:


---

Force-4842

Alias: “Four-Eight,” “The Bleeding Bolt,” or simply “Force.”

Origin:
Cloned in the deep underground vaults of the Obsidian Order, Force-4842 was one of thousands of bio-engineered enforcers meant to suppress rogue AI uprisings and illegal speed cults racing through the Neon Wastes. Most of his batchmates were wiped out in the Battle of Sector 6. He was the only one to survive—by defecting.

Current Role:
Wanders as a rogue enforcer-turned-street racer, racing war-rigs and cyberpunks for parts, rep, and vengeance. Occasionally hired as muscle for high-risk retrieval jobs. He doesn’t talk much. But when he does, you shut the hell up and listen.

Appearance:

Tattered urban combat gear fused with aftermarket drift armor plating

Black visor with a scrolling LED kill-count

Left arm: replaced with a high-torque cybernetic limb built from stolen junkyard exosuits

Right leg: equipped with a magnetic ankle-lock system—used for stabilizing during 250kph drifts

Back-mounted exhausts (no one knows why—they just sound sick)


Vehicle of Choice:
A bastardized, twin-turbo, jet-boosted Nissan S13 hybrid, armored with salvaged carbon panels and powered by a repurposed starship battery. Neon underglow? Only in white, of course—coded with Morse signals no one’s cracked yet.

Personality:

Silent but sarcastic (uses voice modulator for occasional sass)

Trusts no one except his car and maybe an old radio that talks back

Has a soft spot for stray drones and vending machine coffee

Will absolutely beat you in a race, then steal your brakes and leave you rolling down a hill


Catchphrase:
“Initiating disrespect protocol.”

Rate your coffee standards 1-5 and it shows you which Maryland and DC neighborhoods actually match what you want. The scoring works pretty well. If you are a ""coffee is just fuel/gas"" person it will guide you toward average places. If you are a coffee sl#t, and is the type who debates extraction ratios, it knows to send you to Silver Spring, College Park, or Shaw. Also, I tested it on myself (i.e. a level 4 coffee snob) and it reasonably identified my people in the Shaw/Eastern Market area.

Anyway, figured other people might want to use this to justify their housing decisions. Will drop the link if anyone's interested:
