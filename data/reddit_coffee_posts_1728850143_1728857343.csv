1g31648,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/1g31648/question_regarding_koru_lounge/,Question regarding Koru Lounge,"Hi, here's a bit of background. I've come into a some money and am going on my big bucket list trip to Norway with my best friend to see the aurora borealis. There are two big complicating factors.

*  I'm autistic and typically don't do well in big crowds with loads of stimulus.
*  I have Long COVID with fatigue being my primary problem.

My biggest issue is with the Long COVID. Not going on this trip **is not an option**. I can't stop living just because I have a chronic illness. My friend is really good at helping me stay grounded in places like airports and we're working on coping strategies for my fatigue. We plan to mostly travel on Singapore Airlines.

I'm thinking of getting a Koru Lounge pass for this trip so we'll have somewhere relatively calm and quiet-ish to retreat to. Comfortable seats, good coffee and food are some of the attractions for me too. Just knowing we had a place like that to go to would be a weight off my mind. 

I know it's expensive but given what I've laid out here, do people with Koru Lounge experiences (particularly overseas with lounges from partner airlines) think this is a good idea? Please let me know what you think. If you think this idea doesn't hold water, do you have an alternative in mind?",1,1728857306.0,newzealand,0,1.0,False

morning/noon: 
- neutrogena gentle cleanser in the shower
- benzoyl peroxide OR salicylic acid depending on the day
- cera-ve moisturizer immediately after shower

night: 
- cera-ve foaming cleanser 
- prescription adapalene 0.3% if i used salicylic acid in the shower 
- prescription winlevi 1% if i used benzoyl peroxide in the shower


that’s it! and of course i change my towels/sheets/pillowcases regularly. i don’t smoke or drink coffee or consume much dairy. my only vice is sugar but i try very hard to only consume my daily value. i’ve tried accutane but the side effects were too much for me to handle. i do have a dermatologist but i also just wanted to ask regular people how my routine looks. 

is there anything else i can be doing? anything i should change about my routine? 

thanks for any help!

1g3127j,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1g3127j/should_i_really_be_learning_oopspecifically/,"Should I really be learning OOP(specifically creating my own classes) at my current level, or skip it and come back when I'm more experienced?","So, I just finished ""the basics"" of python in terms of learning most important built-in stuff, like if, elifs, loops, def functions, lists, dictionaries, nesting aaaand stuff like that.

Made a few mini projects like guess number game, blackjack, coffee machine...

And right after those basics I was hit with OOP as ""next thing"" in the course and I feel it's like I've skipped 10 chapters in a book. 

Maybe the course has not introduced me with any useful examples of using OOP. I don't understand what's it for, how is it useful and how creating classes is useful to me. 

Current class I'm creating feels unnecessary. Feels like 5x more complicated than if I'd use the skills I already have to build the same thing. I'm basically still using all the basic built-in stuff, but wrapping it in a 2 different class python files, bunch of silly functions, and the word ""self"" repeating itself every 2nd line, I have same thing split to... eh it hurts me head trying to even explain it.

There is so much to remember too, because you essentially have a bunch of functions inside class, these functions have their own attributes, which correlate with what you'll use in the main file so you have to associate/imagine every single line with what you'll use it for and there's this whole branch of class ->function -> function attributes -> what functions does. Multiply it by 6, add 2 more just self \_\_init\_\_ attributes, and ..eh

Learning how to create OOP classes feels like something ""extra"" or ""good-to-know"" for a more experienced programmer, not at all for a newbie, either in terms of understanding, or in terms of using. 

I have not yet touched a code where I have to connect so many dots of dots connected to many different dots, that also have to work with \*some other\* dots.

Alright, I think I'm done complaining.

Oh, wait no. There's one more dot. There we go

td;lr:

1. Is it important to learn OOP?

2. Is it important to learn creating my own classes for OOP?

3. If the answers to above to questions are ""Yes"" - do you think a newbie is a sufficient level of expertise to learn this? ",1,1728856998.0,learnpython,0,1.0,False

Apologies about the format! This seems to be the only way to add both text and photos in the same post.

I have always loved perfumes. I used the Perfume Surprised subscription box for ages to test out different seasonal samples and have kept a full bottle on hand of whichever perfume was my favorite scent at the time. However, I didn't realize that I could turn my love for perfume into a full hobby or create a collection of the perfumes that I adored until November of last year. 

Since then, I've gone on an olfactory journey. I created and maintained a spreadsheet of all the perfumes I have, the perfumes I've tried (including going back into my emails and finding the perfumes I received from the subscription box), the perfumes I want to try, and the notes that I like the most based on how often they show up in the perfumes I like. I ordered over one hundred samples. Some of the samples I bought to explore different specific notes, like cherry, coffee, rose, and vanilla. Other samples I bought based on recommendations about perfumes that evoke specific feelings, such as ""cozy,"" ""ethereal,"" ""midwest corn field"" (this was not incredibly successful - still on the hunt for the perfect scent that transports me back to my favorite childhood fall activity, corn mazes), ""snowy day,"" and ""get shit done""/""boss time.""

I fell in love with so many scents. However, I'm very cautious about purchasing scents that I don't know for certain I will continue to love in the long term. After reading many posts about how people developed their collections and what they wish they would have done, I created a collecting methodology that I think works for me. If I like a 1 mL/2 mL sample, I upgrade to a 5 mL decant. Once I use the entire 5 mL decant, I upgrade to a 10 mL one/travel spray if I absolutely love the scent. Only after using up the whole 10 mL decant or travel spray will I even consider purchasing a full bottle, regardless of price. From my perspective, neither a $30 perfume nor a $300 perfume is worth purchasing unless it survives my testing process because the last thing I want is a collection of perfumes that will go to waste. I basically had the fear of God put in me by redditors who hated how large and unwieldy their collections became because they purchased too many perfumes that they didn't love or that didn't fit into their lifestyle.

The only exceptions are the Oakcha perfumes and perfumes I received as gifts. I thoroughly tested the perfumes the Oakcha dupes were inspired by, but I found the originals lacking in some way. After reading some very good reviews about the dupes, I purchased the Oakcha discovery kit to see whether those scents were a better fit for my collection. I jumped from a discovery kit sample to an FB for the scents that contained everything I loved about the original scents AND also made up for the originals' deficiencies (the exception to this exception is Torrid Day - I haven't tried Tobacco Vanille but I adored the dupe sample and found a good deal for a FB from someone trying to destash). My husband also gave me two perfumes for Christmas last year that didn't make it through my testing process, but I'm okay with that. He purchased them because he listened to me talk about perfumes and wanted to give me some that he thought I would love.

**REVIEW OF MY COLLECTION:**

**Full Bottles** - **complete testing:**

* **Indecent Cherry by BTSO:** I really love the strawberry and cherry combination in this. It's a fresh and clean fruity scent that I thoroughly enjoy wearing when it's warm outside. I was on the fence with this perfume when I first tested it out, but I'm glad that I chose to upgrade to a 5 mL decant despite my hesitations. I reach for this perfume constantly when I want to smell clean but not like I'm wearing perfume - it smells like a fancy shampoo.
* **Dama Bianca by Xerjoff:** This is a powdery, ethereal scent - it's like a whole heavenly host of angels was ground up and stuck in a bottle. I didn't get to test my initial sample on my skin because I accidentally poured the whole thing on my couch as I was trying to get the dabber off. This was actually a surprisingly lucky thing. I spent an entire week smelling the sample when I sat down to relax, and that longer-term testing really sealed the deal for me. I think this was the fastest perfume to make it through my testing process. I bought the initial sample in early December and was ready to commit to a full bottle by February, which also happened to coincide with a sale on Jomashop. Dama Bianca is my easy-reach and all-weather perfume. According to Parfumo, I've remembered to track when I'm wearing this 19 times since getting my 5 mL decant, and I guarantee this is a vast underestimate of the number of times I've used it.
* **Intense Cafe by Montale:** This is my second-most used scent. It smells like a cafe experience. When I wear it, I can picture myself sitting in a cozy coffeeshop sipping on a cappuccino while smelling some freshly cut roses placed at the table. At first, I was a little put off by what I now know is the Montale DNA: a slightly synthetic vanilla base. The juicy/candied rose and hints of coffee were what convinced me to test it out further, and I'm really glad I did. I love wearing this when it's cold and rainy outside, or during the winter when it's snowing. I also find myself reaching for this perfume during the evening when I'm ready to start winding down for the day, as I find it to be just an overall cozy scent. According to my spreadsheet, I thought Intense Cafe is what lofi jazz would smell like and, frankly, I find it hard to disagree with my past self on that. I included the full bottle in the picture for the sake of this review, but I actually transferred Intense Cafe from its original bottle to a vintage perfume bottle I bought secondhand because I genuinely despise the bottle it came in.
* **Lazy Sunday Morning by Replica:** I had trouble deciding whether Lazy Sunday Morning should go in this category or under my exceptions category. I first tried it as part of a discovery kit from Sephora. I made it through a 5 mL decant and was halfway done with a 10 mL decant when I received the full bottle as a Christmas gift from my husband. This is honestly the best floral aldehyde I've tried. It smells like folding fresh, clean laundry on a spring day. The only thing that keeps me from using it regularly is the fact that its longevity is incredibly poor. I can get about an hour with it on my skin or 2 hours if I spray it on my clothes, and I prefer my perfumes to have at least 4-6 hours of solid wear before they disappear. I actually tend to use it more to spray my couch when I have guests over.
* **Delina la Rosee by PDM:** If I had to choose a signature scent, Delina la Rosee would be it. This perfume is about as close as I've ever gotten to blind buying. I was testing perfumes at Macy's about three years ago  and stumbled across a tester just as I thought the entire trip was a bust. I immediately went weak-kneed when I sprayed it and bought it without hesitation. It's the perfect rose perfume, in my opinion: floral without being heavy, aquatic without lacking longevity, and just a hint of lychee to add some depth. I wore this every day for at least two years - long before I started actually collecting. I will be buried with a bottle of this when I die. Thank God Jomashop regularly has sales on PDM perfumes or else my credit card would be in serious trouble.

**Full Bottles - exceptions to testing:**

* **Torrid Day by Oakcha:** Torrid Day is a dupe for Tobacco Vanille by Tom Ford. I can't speak to how they compare as I've never actually tried Tobacco Vanille, and probably would not have tried this if it hadn't come with my Oakcha discovery kit. I wasn't even planning on testing it out because the tobacco leaf note is far outside my perfume comfort zone, but I actually started gravitating to it when the weather got colder. I really love the different types of ""sweet"" present in Torrid Day. The earthy sweetness from the tobacco leaf pairs very well with the rich, dessert-like sweetness from the vanilla to create the ultimate cuddly fall scent. I would have tested this out further or tried Tobacco Vanille if I hadn't come across a fantastic deal for a 30 mL bottle from someone trying to destash their collection. No regrets.
* **Sinful by Oakcha:** This scent was the reason I purchased the Oakcha discovery kit I keep mentioning. I fell in love with Tom Ford's Lost Cherry after testing out a variety of cherry perfumes earlier this year (reviews [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1ahks5v/a_cherry_review/)) but was incredibly disappointed that Lost Cherry basically lasted 15 minutes on my skin. I wanted a dupe that had the cherry liqueur-forward elements from Lost Cherry that I adored but also performed significantly better. According to the posts I found on various subreddits, Sinful and a perfume from Finery sounded like my best bets. I still didn't want to buy an entire bottle without testing, though, and Sinful was the only one I could find a sample for at the time. I'm so glad I found it. It is exactly what I was hoping Lost Cherry would be with the added bonus of not costing an arm and a leg.
* **The Beekeeper by Oakcha:** I thoroughly tested the perfume this was ""inspired by,"" Nectarine Blossom & Honey by Jo Malone, but decided not to go for an FB because of poor longevity. I didn't realize that Oakcha included a dupe in its discovery kit until after I received it. I got really lucky on that front! The Beekeeper has the fresh nectarine scent I loved from the original and lasts 10x as long on my skin. I'm about halfway through a 30 mL bottle at this point because it is one of my favorite things to wear when the weather is hot and humid.
* **Born in Roma Intense by Valentino:** This was the second perfume my husband got me for Christmas. I told him that I really loved Born in Roma, and I think he meant to purchase that instead of the intense version. I'm glad he got this, though! It's probably the only floral scent I have that works better in cold weather than in warm weather, which has been amazing during the summer/fall transitional period. The jasmine and vanilla are wonderful together, and I feel like I'm ready to get shit done when I wear it. I prefer this over the standard Born in Roma.

**10 mL Decants and Travel Sprays:**

* **Born in Roma by Valentino:** I love this perfume and will probably upgrade to a full bottle eventually, but it's taken me nearly a year to get through the travel spray so I'm not sure when that will happen. Born in Roma is a heavy fruity floral. I adore the scent but I struggle with finding a good time to wear it - it's too rich for warm weather but I don't really gravitate towards florals when it's cold outside. 
* **Coffee Addict by Theodoros Kalotinis:** I'm on my third 10 mL decant of Coffee Addict. I should probably bite the bullet and get a full bottle, but I'm waiting to see if someone will get it for my birthday next month or for Christmas. I first tried it out when I was exploring coffee notes (review [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1anpf7l/a_coffee_review/)). I liked it well enough when I sampled it but wasn't sure that I would fall in love with it. I am so glad I decided to test it out some more! Coffee Addict is a smooth cappuccino transformed into a perfume - perfect for cold or rainy days. It's one of my easy-to-reach-for perfumes when the weather gets a bit cold outside or for when I'm in the mood to curl up with my cat on the couch. I don't particularly care about getting compliments and rarely spray enough for anyone to smell my perfume unless they're standing close to me. That being said, Coffee Addict is the perfume I get complimented on the most. It was even an icebreaker between me and my supervising attorney during my summer internship!
* **In Love With Everything by Imaginary Authors:** The 1980s in a bottle. If ""Heaven is a Place on Earth"" by Belinda Carlisle were a scent, it would be In Love With Everything. This is a carefree, happy fruit punch scent that makes me want to go to a rollerskating rink and spin around for hours. 
* **By the Fireplace by Replica:** I got this sample in the same discovery kit as Lazy Sunday Morning. Nine times out of ten, the black pepper note is the only thing I can smell. However, it is one of my favorite scents of all time during the rare occasion I pick up anything other than pepper. During those moments, I love that this smells just like a bonfire on a cold, late autumn evening in the middle of an already-harvested cornfield. 
* **Philosykos EDP by Diptyque:** Philosykos is second only to Dama Bianca in terms of how quickly I've upgraded from sample to 10 mL decant. It is a lovely, green tree in a non-woody way. While most ""tree"" scents smell like bark, Philosykos smells like the inside layers of a freshly snapped twig from a fig tree. I'm still making my way through my first 10 mL, though, because I don't often want to smell like a tree and I've been disappointed by the longevity of this perfume.
* **A Drop D'Issey by Issey Miyake (5 mL pictured, 10 mL ordered):** This perfume envelops me in a soft cloud of lilacs. I feel like this scent is what Arwen from Lord of The Rings would wear. It fills a similar niche for me as Dama Bianca, but it's sufficiently different that I can still see it becoming a full member of my collection. Dama Bianca is fruity ethereal, whereas A Drop D'Issey is floral ethereal. 
* **Musk Therapy by Initio (not pictured):** I'm about to order my second 10 mL decant of this. Musk Therapy is a cozy blanket fresh out of the dryer and one of my favorite things to wear when I get home after a long day. I probably would have already purchased a full bottle of this if I found a good sale, but instead I'm crossing my fingers that some very nice person will gift it to me for my birthday or Christmas.

**5 mL Decants I Love:**

* **Celeste by Giardini di Toscana:** My first impression of this perfume was that it smelled just like bananas and bubblegum at the same time. It was bizarre in the best way imaginable. It is incredibly sweet without being cloying, and has a creaminess to it from its vanilla base while avoiding feeling like a heavy gourmand. It is a light dessert during warm weather and a fluffy marshmallow during colder weather. If you can't tell, I'm still unsure what to think about it and that is exactly why I will be testing it out some more. There aren't many scents that really make me think about them, and I appreciate that Celeste does just that.
* **Vicebomb by Simone Andreoli:** The initial opening of Vicebomb is incredibly reminiscent of Intense Cafe because it has a similar, vanilla-forward scent. Once it settles, though, it smells like black cherries drizzled over rich vanilla soft serve ice cream. I loved wearing this during the evenings last winter and would have upgraded to a 10 mL already if the weather hadn't warmed up around the time I received my 5 mL decant. I know for certain that I will purchase a full bottle of this someday.
* **Santal Basmati by Affinescence:** I love that this smells just like basmati rice. I don't often want to smell like basmati rice, though, so I tend to just take the top off the decant and give it a good sniff from time to time.
* **Meliora by PDM:** Meliora is the smell of drinking sparkling fruit cider in a blooming spring garden. I'm unsure whether it will make it to the 10 mL stage, though, because it has such poor longevity. I'm thinking that I might try to find a dupe that lasts longer.
* **Erba Pura by Xerjoff:** This is either a rich lemon bar or an orange creamsicle - the jury is still out on that front. I also get high end sun tan lotion from it. There's some element of Erba Pura that reminds me of a vacation I took to Florida when I was a kid, but I have absolutely no idea what that element is or why it screams, ""Florida!"" I'm looking forward to testing this out some more next spring and summer.
* **L'eau D'hiver by Frederic Malle:** L'eau D'hiver was my lesson not to jump from 1 mL sample to travel size spray. I broke my rule after sampling it last winter because I adored the way it smelled like flowers popping out of a fresh dusting of snow. However, the longevity is practically non-existent and I sometimes smell black pepper instead of the scent that captivated me. There's no pepper note listed, though, so I'm all ears if anyone knows why I smell it.
* **Chokedee by Strangers Parfumerie (not pictured):** I finished my 5 mL decant and will be upgrading to 10 mL next spring. This smells just like freshly made Thai Black Sticky Rice! I wore it at least once per week throughout the spring and summer, and probably would have worn it more if I didn't happen to also be testing other warm-weather perfumes around the same time.
* **Pulp by Byredo (not pictured):**  Pulp is freshly squeezed juice. It's refreshingly fruity with a hint of greenery - it makes me picture drinking homemade juice on my grandmother's porch in rural Nebraska during a hot July afternoon. This is another perfume I will be upgrading to a 10 mL when the weather warms up again.
* **Mojave Ghost by Byredo (not pictured):** Much like A Drop D'Issey, Mojave Ghost makes me think of Arwen from Lord of The Rings. It's clean, fresh, airy, and ethereal. I feel like this is what an air nymph would smell like. I fell in love with this perfume from the very second I opened the sample, and I'm pretty sure this will eventually turn into a full bottle with enough time.

**Recent Samples That Might Go the Distance (cue the Hercules soundtrack):**

* **Eau Duelle by Diptyque:** I think this is one of the best vanillas I have ever tried. It's a pure, calming vanilla without veering into vanilla extract territory.  
* **Creme Brulee by Theodoros Kalotinis:** This smells just like the dessert it's named after. I can smell both the vanilla custard and the caramelized sugar. I feel like this perfume captured the exact moment you break open the top of creme brulee but before you've had your first bite. I think I will really enjoy this during the winter.
* **Vanilla in Bourbon by Scents of Wood:** Vanilla in Bourbon gives me a similar feeling as Torrid Day, and I'm thinking they might fill a similar niche for me. The only difference is that this perfume gets its depth from a bourbon note instead of tobacco leaf.
* **Blanche by Byredo:** I stumbled across this one while testing out cotton-like scents (sorry, no review this time) and really love that it has my favorite parts of Lazy Sunday Morning without the poor performance.",1,1728856871.0,FemFragLab30plus,0,1.0,False

I saw this girl for three years. In the beginning we were friends. I knew she lived with her bf. She was a bartender at the bar I frequented. She was the first one to reach out to me in random ways periodically via fb. “Did I see you running with your dog today?” “Hey I had a weird dream you were in it” I ended up starting to have longer conversations with her. Then she suggested getting coffee together. We got coffee and would talk for hours almost daily. She said her relationship was on the rocks. He was “boring” he wasn’t interested in her anymore. Then eventually it became “I’m moving out soon we are on a break we just live together “ she swore to me they were no longer dating. I never saw him come to her work. We ended up starting to sleep together. This was daily as well for two years just about and she moved bins into my house and said she was going to move out. I kept getting “soon I just need a plan” finally I got fed up and messaged him. He told me they weren’t on a break. He asked for proof I’d been seeing her. I sent him screenshots of our messages. That day she blocked my number and went running back to him. She kept a line of communication open on Pinterest. She said she did it intentionally. A month went by and I noticed a lot of her posts on Pinterest seemed directed towards me or hinting at emotional pain for losing someone you cared for. She never reached out though. Finally I messaged her and she responded. We slowly started talking again. Then we started seeing each other. This time I knew she was with him. Again she tells me the relationship was sort of ruined and all they did was fight. She also said she couldn’t give me a relationship but down the road could. One day she calls me up crying saying they had a huge blow out. He apparently got her Apple ID or had spyware installed and was getting texts sent to his phone. Thing is we weren’t texting we were messaging on Pinterest. I became suspicious that perhaps there was a third guy involved. She ended up getting a new phone moved out(as far as I know ) so one day we’re messaging and she sends me a message by mistake . “Hey can you cover my shift I’m going to a wedding with Mike” meant to send it to a coworker. Then she calls me feeds me all these lies about how it’s her friends husband she’s going with. I didn’t believe it. The more I dug the more she lied then she slowly distanced herself from me. This person told me every day and night she loved me and missed me. Then flipped a switch and I don’t hear from her at all now. It’s fucked with my head so bad. She said she doesn’t want me out of her life completely wants to be friends. I’ve heard she is seeing this Mike person now. She denies to me that she is. I have no energy left to investigate. I am broken. I’ve been waiting years for her to follow through with her promise of a relationship. I feel like a fool and worthless and a loser. I don’t know how to move on. I’ve been through breakups before but never under these circumstances. Everyone at the bar thought we were dating. She even said I was her bf to her coworkers and other regulars. All the while still sleeping with her guy at home. It’s just such a mind fuck. I’m stuck questioning if any of it was real. If I was being used and if so what for? I am an over thinker to begin with. How the fuck do you move on from something when you aren’t even sure it ever existed. How do you find closure to something that may have just been a lie. I know I was in the wrong for sleeping with her when she got
Back with him. Perhaps it’s karma. I just needed to vent this out. I want to message her but I don’t get responses much anymore they are short unless it’s just regular chatting. She said “I don’t want to lead you on” it all “fell apart” when I caught her in the lie and I got angry with her. I was questioning everything and became extremely
Controlling. I wanted proof. She grew tired of the control because she had just exited a controlling relationship she said. She just wanted to fix herself. She asked for space. I want to make it a few months without messaging her. It’s just hard. If you read this all bless your soul.",1,1728856748.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Can it be fixed?,"I’ll go into detail as much as possible. While I think I know the answer deep inside, I’d still like to hear insights from strangers. 

We been dating for a year now, we met on the apps and it grew quickly from there. We both were very upfront that we are looking for serious relationship and refined it a month in. First few months were great, we fell into honeymoon phase, spend loads of nights together, celebrated holidays with his family (mine are far away). Shortly after courting stage and organizing dates we fell into slump that consisted of loads of reality tv and snacking on my couch and not much else. It was winter, so it worked. But seasons changed, however our habits didn’t. 

Eventually I started to find him rather annoying. I like little Sunday morning drives to get coffee in a little neighbourhood that you often don’t go. Or drive 45mina for the best tacos around. However, he would always challenged that there’s no need to drive miles away when we could have coffee at home. Or have tacos nearby. I understand the logical reason, but it’s not that I brought it up often. I wanted to go out and explore and do something else than just stay in all the time. He just wouldn’t see the point and it would be met with “do we have to? Today?”.

He works for himself and mostly from home, has very small social circle that he sees once in couple months or less and lives with his parents. I work with general public a lot and by the time my weekend rolls in, I’m socially exhausted, I want to sit down in peace and quiet and quiet for a bit. (I’m on introvert side). However given his lack of social life or interactions with others, I am pretty much his social life and when we meet at the start of my weekend, we are on completely different wavelengths. He eventually understood that adjusted, but I think him not having social life outside of me, really bothers. I don’t have tons of friends, but I have roommates, friends, work friends that I interact often and have regular meets. Besides social life, he downer any hobbies besides watching sports on tv and few fantasy leagues. We both gained a bit of weight due to snacks and basically no activities, and talked about it. I since then joined the gym, but again, my lifestyle in general is more active as I’m always on my feet at work, I have dog that needs walks, etc. While he remained in the same spot. 

And I guess the biggest part is that we come from different walks of life. I grew up very much lower middle class with hard working parents. I moved out to foreign country at 19 and then moved across the world at 27. I had to start from zero both times. I did very well for myself and am proud of what I achieved. But I do think we lack of life experience and hardships to be able to relate to each other. I’ve travelled a bit, I’ve never had a lot of support from my parents both financially and mentally. I had few really serious relationships that failed, and general life experience that shaped me to be who I am. I’m very resilient and strong, while I don’t think he’s able to troubleshoot. And I think this is where it’s hard for me to trust him and see serious future with him. I just don’t think he would be able to weather hardships or challenges should they come our way. He tries to symphatize but it sometimes comes more condescending than understanding. When me or my friends share some experience that they’re going through it’s usually responded with “oh yeah, I totally get it, my buddy/mom/uncle/school mate (never his own experience) went through this. 
We never just have a light moment. All my attempts to joke are taken literally and explained to me. If I jokingly said oh look it’s so sunny in the middle of the night, he would respond with “no, it’s actually pitch black right now.” I obviously know it’s not sunny and just trying to bring some lightness to our relationship but it always fails.  

I should note that we both are aligned on a relationships where man is in his masculine and woman in a feminine. I know that’s controversial opinion, but just go with it. 
However, I’m not able to be in my feminine since I can’t trust him. He knows I’m not happy and have hard time with all this. To be fair sometimes I can be really mean because I feel annoyed by him all the time and my temper is very short recently. 

We have had multiple conversations regarding all of the above, however they didn’t change much. I don’t know if we are not compatible or I need to loosen up. ",2,1728856461.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

Had one day to see as much as we could at Disneyland Paris. We’re from California and very familiar with Disneyland Resort (DLR) and California Adventure (DCA), and this felt like a once in a lifetime opportunity. Thanks to everyone who offered advice—could have easily spent 2-3 days here, and in retrospect I would’ve done things slightly differently, but we got to see and do SO much.

We did the 2-park pass and splurged (a lot) on the Premiere Access pass. 

We were staying in Paris and took the RER to the parks. Mostly seamless on the way there, but on the way back the tickets we’d purchased in advance weren’t working. We think maybe they got wiped in our bags? Not sure. We arrived around 8:50, tried to enter the parks to wait at rope drop only to learn there’s a separate line for non-magic hr guests, and found the correct line. While one of us waited another went to go get some pastries and hot chocolate from the Brasserie Rosalie takeout counter. (Had high hopes for this place but it was pretty mediocre, but leaps and bounds less bad than the in-park food we unfortunately tried.)

At 9:30, the gates opened! We had decided to start at WDS to knock out the things we wanted to do there and then make our way to Disneyland. 

Here’s everything we did and the time we finished each activity: 

Started (per child request) with webslingers. Got off ride at 10:00. 

Slinky dog, 10:08

Ratatouille, 10:28 (Cute ride, but watch out if you’re prone to motion sickness.)

Crush 10:44 (DEAR LORD. Half my kids were traumatized and I was sooooo close to throwing up. Felt awful for two hours after. My other kids adored it.) 

Buzz 11:26

Autopia 11:55 (Shorter than the DLR version, and also less charming.)

hyperspace mountain 12:08 (more intense by far than DLR)

Nautilus walkthrough 12:20 (Loved this! DLR needs more of these lineless, no-ride attractions.)

Snack break 

Orbitron 12:42 (got the passes. goes higher than the DLR version.)

Got coffee

Nautilus again 12:5

Castle walkthrough 1:13 (Dragon closed! Bummer) 

Sword in stone 1:18

Tea cups 1:45

Lunch (sooooo bad holy crap. Ate from the little stands with tartiflette and crepes etc in fantasyland. )

Storybook canal (wait time posted 15 min but more like 25) 2:30 (super cute! Loved the smaller boats here)

Labyrinth 3pm 

Small world 3:18 (5/10. Lacks the unhinged charm of the original)

Peter Pan 3:37 (No fastpass in CA so we never go—this was a treat) 

Pirates 3:58 (such a good version! Liked it more than DLR)

Casey Jr 4:30 (surprise roller coaster! Perfect for the kids who hated crush.)

Popcorn (the only non terrible thing we ate)

BTMR SPLIT (5:15, again 5:35)

Phantom manor 5:50
Adventure isle and treehouse SPLIT (those of us who didn’t do BTMR and Phantom Manor) 5:50

Mickey and the magician 7pm (bought the guaranteed access. This was SO good. Thank you to redditors who suggested prioritizing this show: truly impressive.) 

Cars rally 7:20 

Parachute Drop 7:35

Ratatouille 2nd time 7:59

Dinner from brasserie Rosalie takeout (5/10; the people working there were all super nice though) 

Web slingers Round 2 8:55

Buzz 2 9:34

Shopped Star traders and Main Street shops and watched the drone show and fireworks. (Just ok, imo! DLR’s are much better.) left finally around 10:45. 

Characters we saw walking around in the parks: 
Stepsisters
Tigger
Maleficent 
Moana
Cheshire Cat 
Queen of hearts 
Peter Pan and Wendy 
Stitch (waving goodbye)

Overall, an amazing day. This park is so beautiful. At DLR it’s basically the same season all year and you don’t get a feel of seasonality except from the decor, so seeing all the fall color in the leaves was just gorgeous. Also, it was a Sunday in October and we’d been prepped for crowds, but it was so empty and open and quiet compared to DLR. in Disneyland Paris there were so many places where you feel like you’re just alone exploring. This straight up doesn’t exist at DLR. The playgrounds were a quiet respite instead of insanely crowded. Also loved how there were lots of no line no ride attractions—walkthroughs, mazes, etc. DLR needs so much more of this. As Americans, we also felt super safe knowing people just generally don’t have guns. 

Some things we missed: 
Railroad 
Indiana jones
Dragon
Agrabah walkthrough 
Other shows 

And what I’d do differently next time: I’d probably start in Fantasyland and work my way through, then do either Adventure/frontierland or Tomorrowland, then head over to WDS and do several shows. In DLR, most rides don’t have short lines at night the way they do here, so I would skip webslingers, any of the smaller rides, and leave them for night.

Things started off really well. He’s M31 (almost 32), I’m F25. We hit it off over messages, and he suggested we meet up in person.

**Date 1**: For our first date, we met in his city (I live 30 minutes away by train and was staying with my brother there anyway). It started off pretty casual. We grabbed coffee, and from the beginning, it felt comfortable—he seemed genuinely excited to meet me, sharing his cake and asking thoughtful questions about what I do and where I'm from. The conversation flowed easily.

He suggested we take a walk and play some arcade games, which was fun. He hesitated a bit before suggesting we ride a scooter together (maybe afraid I’d reject being close), but I agreed. Since I didn’t know how to drive it, he stood behind me and drove, and it was really sweet. He showed me around the city, including the highest floor of a hotel to see a beautiful view, and then some of the best streets.

At one point, he mentioned that I seemed hard to read and couldn’t tell if I was having a good time. I reassured him that I was, but it just takes me a while to open up. He rode a scooter with me to the bus station, hugged me goodbye, and said we should do this again. When I got home, I texted him to thank him for the date, and he asked for my number and suggested we meet the following week. He texted me sometimes during the week and was sweet overall.

**Date 2**: This time, he came to my small city, taking the train to see me. He was more touchy this time, but in a good way. We got coffee again and sat by the riverside, feeding the birds. Afterward, we went bowling, and he was extra supportive, putting his arm around my waist. I’m shy, especially when I like someone, so I didn’t know how to react, but I was okay with it.

He then mentioned going to a nightclub (with a nervous look like he was testing the waters). I hesitated and told him I would’ve liked to know beforehand. I explained that I’d never been to a nightclub, only pubs, and he said I should try it with some friends to see if I’d like it.

We went out for dinner, where he touched my hands, commented on how soft they were, and asked if I ever smoked. He said Im so innocent when I said I’d never tried it. He complimented me, saying I looked good in red, and insisted on paying for dinner. Afterward, we walked around my university, and that’s when he kissed me for the first time. It was sweet and didn’t feel rushed.

As we waited for his train, he held my hand, interlocked fingers, kissed me again, and even played with my hair. He complimented how good I smelled and mentioned some future places we could visit. He also showed me how to dance a little salsa while we waited. It was cute. We kissed and hugged goodbye, and I had to run to catch my bus. He texted me when he got home to make sure I’d caught my bus, which I appreciated. The next day I noticed he added a new picture to his Bumble profile, but I didn’t think much of it.

After that, though, his texts started to slow down. He’d reply late, and at one point, he said his sleep was bad and he had a doctor’s appointment. He still mentioned wanting to meet again but wasn’t as direct. He asked if I had plans for the weekend, and when I said I didn’t, he said he didn’t either. I ended up telling him I’d be in his city that weekend, and he agreed to meet. The day before, he told me he might be sick. I offered to cancel, but he said he could still meet if he felt better, which he did.

**Date 3**: When he saw me, his face lit up, and he said, “It’s so good to see you.” We grabbed coffee, and during this time, he brought up two future date ideas. He mentioned a bowling place near his home and joked about getting me a custom bowling ball as a gift because I struggle to find one that fits my hand. He also asked if I liked chocolate and suggested visiting a chocolate place he’d been to.

We spent the day walking around a park with animals. Despite saying he might be sick, he seemed fine. He took a phone call, explained who it was, and apologized. He stayed engaged throughout the date and even mentioned that if he’d known I was free in the evening, he would’ve planned something for us.

As the date went on, he continued to hold my hand and be physically affectionate. When we reached the station, he suggested we take a picture together in a photo booth, saying, “It’s about time for a picture.” I sat on his lap, and we kissed in the booth (though I realized he was trying to French kiss, but I was too nervous to let it happen). It was funny and awkward, but in a good way. Afterward, he hugged me tightly, kissed me again, and mentioned trying a restaurant next time. Then he said goodbye, and I took the train home.

**The Switch**: Six days went by without a word from him. Eventually, I texted to ask what was going on. That’s when he sent me a message saying, “Hey! I'm ok, just a bit stressed at work, I think. I think you’re wonderful, but somehow it doesn’t feel completely right for me :( Maybe our age difference is part of it, not sure. So not sure if we should continue.”

I told him I would’ve appreciated it if he’d been more upfront instead of leaving me wondering. He apologized, saying, “I’m sorry. I guess I just needed some time to think.” I asked why he’d suggested meeting again if he’d felt this way, and added, “I don’t know what went wrong… but it doesn’t matter now. It was fun, wish you the best.” He replied, “I had a good time. I wish you the best also.”

That was the last we talked. I unmatched him on Bumble and deleted his contact. But looking back, I’m confused. He was talking about future plans, took a photobooth picture together which felt nice... I don’t know what happened, and sometimes I wish I’d been more myself—less stressed and more open to his advances.

**So, Reddit, here’s my question: What went wrong? He seemed so into me during the dates, and now I’m left confused. I really liked him and wish I could fix things.**",1,1728855858.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

i just had another appointment last week where they upped my dose to 10mg and changed it to XR. still absolutely nothing. i drink chai in the morning with my medication to try to get me going but it still doesn’t last throughout the day and i sometimes have to drink coffee halfway through the day just to stay awake. 

it’s only been about a week of taking the 10mg XR and I know it’s not working, but i don’t want my doctor to think i’m drug seeking. they have been very understanding the past couple of appointments and didn’t seem to pass any judgment or give me reasons to believe they would be, but i’m still cautious. how long should i wait to tell them the medication isn’t working?

About 40% of my brain thinks let's just stop the incessant cycle of up and down because you've been doing this since you were 17 and it's time to let it go. And for now I've been kinda letting that 40% win out and avoiding the impulse to get really restrictive again but I'm not happy about it. And frankly I should be THRILLED that I'm here and able to enjoy everything in life that's far more meaningful than an ED. I objectively think I look better now but it was never about that at all. I genuinely miss the ED so much more than I thought I would and feel myself trying to go back to it which I will inevitably regret when I end up in some HLOC once again.

I knew she lived with her bf. She was a bartender at the bar I frequented. She was the first one to reach out to me in random ways periodically via fb. “Did I see you running with your dog today?” “Hey I had a weird dream you were in it” I ended up starting to have longer conversations with her. Then she suggested getting coffee together. We got coffee and would talk for hours almost daily. She said her relationship was on the rocks. He was “boring” he wasn’t interested in her anymore. Then eventually it became “I’m moving out soon we are on a break we just live together “ she swore to me they were no longer dating. I never saw him come to her work. We ended up starting to sleep together. This was daily as well for two years just about and she moved bins into my house and said she was going to move out. I kept getting “soon I just need a plan” finally I got fed up and messaged him. He told me they weren’t on a break. He asked for proof I’d been seeing her. I sent him screenshots of our messages. That day she blocked my number and went running back to him. She kept a line of communication open on Pinterest. She said she did it intentionally. A month went by and I noticed a lot of her posts on Pinterest seemed directed towards me or hinting at emotional pain for losing someone you cared for. She never reached out though. Finally I messaged her and she responded. We slowly started talking again. Then we started seeing each other. This time I knew she was with him. Again she tells me the relationship was sort of ruined and all they did was fight. She also said she couldn’t give me a relationship but down the road could. One day she calls me up crying saying they had a huge blow out. He apparently got her Apple ID or had spyware installed and was getting texts sent to his phone. Thing is we weren’t texting we were messaging on Pinterest. I became suspicious that perhaps there was a third guy involved. She ended up getting a new phone moved out(as far as I know ) so one day we’re messaging and she sends me a message by mistake . “Hey can you cover my shift I’m going to a wedding with Mike” meant to send it to a coworker. Then she calls me feeds me all these lies about how it’s her friends husband she’s going with. I didn’t believe it. The more I dug the more she lied then she slowly distanced herself from me. This person told me every day and night she loved me and missed me. Then flipped a switch and I don’t hear from her at all now. It’s fucked with my head so bad. She said she doesn’t want me out of her life completely wants to be friends. I’ve heard she is seeing this Mike person now. She denies to me that she is. I have no energy left to investigate. I am broken. I’ve been waiting years for her to follow through with her promise of a relationship. I feel like a fool and worthless and a loser. I don’t know how to move on. I’ve been through breakups before but never under these circumstances. Everyone at the bar thought we were dating. She even said I was her bf to her coworkers and other regulars. All the while still sleeping with her guy at home. It’s just such a mind fuck. I’m stuck questioning if any of it was real. If I was being used and if so what for? I am an over thinker to begin with. How the fuck do you move on from something when you aren’t even sure it ever existed. How do you find closure to something that may have just been a lie.

1g30i3w,https://i.redd.it/if7yrouqelud1.jpeg,Finally tried light roast on my Bambino plus,"Since the beginning of my home barista journey three years ago, I almost exclusively drink medium/medium-dark roast. Earlier this year, I started to try more lighter roast, but only for pour over.

There’re many post here claiming both bambino and niche zero are not good at lighter roast, so just take their words and never even tried it. Until today, when I found out I don’t have much medium roast left but still have quite some light roast, I figure I should give it a try, how bad could it really be? 

Of course I used all the techniques recommended by folks here including empty shots prior, longer extraction time, etc. I make a latte with it, and you know what, I loved it! Not saying it’s better than what I made before with medium roast, but it’s different and enjoyable!

That’s the lesson learned for me today. Use all the information in this lovely community as a reference and never refrain from trying new things. At the end of the day, we’re all in here for an experience and coffee taste is a subjective thing. My preference on the milk based drinks probably hides some of the weakness other posts pointed out, and I believe their claim that other setups are more capable of handling light roast!

I basically informed people who came to my stand about my university, its study programmes, how to enroll etc. and there were many other representatives of different universities there. 
The other representatives are pretty much all above 40. I went to have some small talk with them, then I met a representative from another university from the same town I live in. We talked about our universities, made some jokes, laughed a bit, and he gave me his Business card. He told me he could hook me up with a job as a programmer (I told him I was a Computer Science student in my last year).
A week has passed and I didn't call him yet (had to deal with some deadlines). My question now is, how should I approach him? I've never been in the job market, and I don't really know what the most ""professional"" approach here is. Should I email him? Should I call him? What exactly should I tell him? Do I straightforward ask him about the job? Or do I ask him if he has time for a coffee and talk about the job there?
Thanks in advance to any productive answer!

1g30ejf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1g30ejf/i_havent_been_this_happy_in_years/,I haven’t been this happy in years. ,"Growing up, I was always thin and underweight. I was very active in sports all throughout childhood and high school; I also struggled with anorexia and bulimia in my late teens and early 20’s. I put emphasis on my appearance and went to great lengths to maintain what I deemed a desirable physique, except I was never satisfied even when I was skin and bones. I was very sick and depriving my body of essential nutrients it needed. Although I was thin, I was in no way healthy. 

Fast forward to my early 20’s, I overcame the aforementioned and began to slowly gain weight. For context, I’m 5’2 and at my lowest in high school I probably weighed 90 pounds. I brought myself up to a healthy weight in my early 20’s, around 120 pounds. Around this time I was also dealing with a stressful family situation, which jump-started what would be 8 years of slow and subtle weight gain. At first I was sad as I continued to watch the scale creep up; I gained on average about 10 pounds per year. On top of family issues I was experiencing, I also started a demanding + sedative corporate job where I spent the better part of 12 hours a day glued to my desk. I eventually hit a stage of acceptance where I thought I could never lose the weight. My eating habits were poor and I always felt physically worse after I worked out. I’m mourned the life my early years afforded me. I took for granted feeling confident. I took for granted being excited to go clothes shopping. I used to love fashion but felt my passion for it slowly decline the more I wasn’t able to fit into pieces that flattered my body.

Back in July 2024 at my heaviest weight of 205 pounds, I knew something had to give not only for my confidence but for my health. My doctor got me started on Zepbound in late July 2024. Just three months and I’m down nearly 20 pounds to 186. While I still do work the demanding corporate job, I’ve gotten better at setting boundaries and putting my physical and mental health first.

I live in a major US city that I love and have lived here for quite some time. I used to love waking up, walking around, taking in my surroundings. At my heaviest, I stopped doing these things and rarely left the house because I was so embarrassed and ashamed of how I looked. I would get out of breath easily, I would hate looking at myself in the mirror of the stores I went into.

Today was the first time in a long time that I woke up, left my house and truly had a day around the city where I walked around and fell in love with the city all over again. I felt so happy and content that I felt like I could literally burst. I’m not someone who has ever really suffered with depression and I’ve always been someone who has a general love for life, but this feeling today was something like no other. This feeling was a feeling that I didn’t think I’d ever get to experience again. I move around so much faster, I’m never out of breath, I opt to take the stairs now instead of the escalator. I walked around, grabbed a coffee, went into stores and was just so content. This medication has literally changed my life. Although I still have quite a bit to go before I hit my goal weight I am just in such awe of the mental change that this has given me in the past three months. It’s been slow and although I don’t necessarily notice major changes in the mirror yet, the non-scale victories are proving to be some of the biggest wins yet.

Things started off really well. He’s M31 (almost 32), I’m F25. We hit it off over messages, and he suggested we meet up in person.

**Date 1**: For our first date, we met in his city (I live 30 minutes away by train and was staying with my brother there anyway). It started off pretty casual. We grabbed coffee, and from the beginning, it felt comfortable—he seemed genuinely excited to meet me, sharing his cake and asking thoughtful questions about what I do and where I'm from. The conversation flowed easily.

He suggested we take a walk and play some arcade games, which was fun. He hesitated a bit before suggesting we ride a scooter together (maybe afraid I’d reject being close), but I agreed. Since I didn’t know how to drive it, he stood behind me and drove, and it was really sweet. He showed me around the city, including the highest floor of a hotel to see a beautiful view, and then some of the best streets.

At one point, he mentioned that I seemed hard to read and couldn’t tell if I was having a good time. I reassured him that I was, but it just takes me a while to open up. He rode a scooter with me to the bus station, hugged me goodbye, and said we should do this again. When I got home, I texted him to thank him for the date, and he asked for my number and suggested we meet the following week. He texted me sometimes during the week and was sweet overall.

**Date 2**: This time, he came to my small city, taking the train to see me. He was more touchy this time, but in a good way. We got coffee again and sat by the riverside, feeding the birds. Afterward, we went bowling, and he was extra supportive, putting his arm around my waist. I’m shy, especially when I like someone, so I didn’t know how to react, but I was okay with it.

He then mentioned going to a nightclub (with a nervous look like he was testing the waters). I hesitated and told him I would’ve liked to know beforehand. I explained that I’d never been to a nightclub, only pubs, and he said I should try it with some friends to see if I’d like it.

We went out for dinner, where he touched my hands, commented on how soft they were, and asked if I ever smoked. He said Im so innocent when I said I’d never tried it. He complimented me, saying I looked good in red, and insisted on paying for dinner. Afterward, we walked around my university, and that’s when he kissed me for the first time. It was sweet and didn’t feel rushed.

As we waited for his train, he held my hand, interlocked fingers, kissed me again, and even played with my hair. He complimented how good I smelled and mentioned some future places we could visit. He also showed me how to dance a little salsa while we waited. It was cute. We kissed and hugged goodbye, and I had to run to catch my bus. He texted me when he got home to make sure I’d caught my bus, which I appreciated. The next day I noticed he added a new picture to his Bumble profile, but I didn’t think much of it.

After that, though, his texts started to slow down. He’d reply late, and at one point, he said his sleep was bad and he had a doctor’s appointment. He still mentioned wanting to meet again but wasn’t as direct. He asked if I had plans for the weekend, and when I said I didn’t, he said he didn’t either. I ended up telling him I’d be in his city that weekend, and he agreed to meet. The day before, he told me he might be sick. I offered to cancel, but he said he could still meet if he felt better, which he did.

**Date 3**: When he saw me, his face lit up, and he said, “It’s so good to see you.” We grabbed coffee, and during this time, he brought up two future date ideas. He mentioned a bowling place near his home and joked about getting me a custom bowling ball as a gift because I struggle to find one that fits my hand. He also asked if I liked chocolate and suggested visiting a chocolate place he’d been to.

We spent the day walking around a park with animals. Despite saying he might be sick, he seemed fine. He took a phone call, explained who it was, and apologized. He stayed engaged throughout the date and even mentioned that if he’d known I was free in the evening, he would’ve planned something for us.

As the date went on, he continued to hold my hand and be physically affectionate. When we reached the station, he suggested we take a picture together in a photo booth, saying, “It’s about time for a picture.” I sat on his lap, and we kissed in the booth (though I realized he was trying to French kiss, but I was too nervous to let it happen). It was funny and awkward, but in a good way. Afterward, he hugged me tightly, kissed me again, and mentioned trying a restaurant next time. Then he said goodbye, and I took the train home.

**The Switch**: Six days went by without a word from him. Eventually, I texted to ask what was going on. That’s when he sent me a message saying, “Hey! I'm ok, just a bit stressed at work, I think. I think you’re wonderful, but somehow it doesn’t feel completely right for me :( Maybe our age difference is part of it, not sure. So not sure if we should continue.”

I told him I would’ve appreciated it if he’d been more upfront instead of leaving me wondering. He apologized, saying, “I’m sorry. I guess I just needed some time to think.” I asked why he’d suggested meeting again if he’d felt this way, and added, “I don’t know what went wrong… but it doesn’t matter now. It was fun, wish you the best.” He replied, “I had a good time. I wish you the best also.”

That was the last we talked. I unmatched him on Bumble and deleted his contact. But looking back, I’m confused. He was talking about future plans, took a photobooth picture together which felt nice... I don’t know what happened, and sometimes I wish I’d been more myself—less stressed and more open to his advances.

**So, Reddit, here’s my question: What went wrong? He seemed so into me during the dates, and now I’m left confused. I really liked him and wish I could fix things.**",1,1728855027.0,dating,3,1.0,False

Some changes I've made over the past year:

I cut out most instances of dairy.   I stopped putting half and half in my coffee, now I just drink it black.  Cheese used to be a fairly common snack, but now no longer. I would enjoy pizza maybe once a month or so, consuming a medium pie over several days; now I've only had one slice in the past year.  When ordering food at a place like Chipotle, I always skip the cheese and sour cream.

Meat is now mostly just chicken and fish.  I haven't gone so far as to only have lean chicken breasts; I still have thighs and legs, but I avoid the skin.

Cooking with oil: switched almost entirely to avocado oil.  In retrospect this one was pretty bad before.  I was cooking with coconut oil and ghee a fair amount.

Breakfast is now steel cut oats 5/6 days of the week.  I also make sure to load up my plate with veggies and beans before anything else.  If I'm hungry between meals, I snack on veggies or nuts.

I could probably bring the LDL down a bit more if I start tracking my saturated fat and soluble fiber intake.  Though I'm hesitant to do so, as I find tracking macros can be difficult to sustain.  I've had success losing weight in the past by calorie counting, but it's easy for the diet to slip and the weight to slowly start creeping back up once the tracking stops.  

Overall, I'm fairly happy with how I'm doing and what I'm eating.  I was never a big red meat eater, so I'm not missing too much there.  I do miss pizza and cheese though.  Lol.

1g305vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1g305vv/title_and_author_please/,Title and author please ,"My husband,Billy was supposedly working hard in the office but somehow managed to find time to teach some blonde anatomy lessons.
""Isla!""
Billy pulled his manhood out of the blonde and dressed himself. ""Get up,"" he smacked the blonde's skinny thigh to get her to move.
She did as he instructed. He pointed at the door for the blonde to leave, and she looked at him as if she couldn't believe he was asking her to leave.
""You need to leave, honey, before I kill you,"" I said to her without raising my voice.
 Her shameful departure left Billy and I alone in a room filled with palpable tension that I could cut it with a knife.
There is something else I would love to cut with a knife...
My husband's wayward manhood.
————————
So that is a picture of me up there. Now, I will introduce myself properly.
Isla Reinhardt is thirty, married with three kids and a husband. We have been married for ten years, and I will tell you a brief tale of how we met.
I am a small-town girl, innocent, naive, very trusting, and a Christian. I hadn't had many dealings with men before I met Billy.
I had just finished college in a community college near our town because my parents didn't want me to go far, as they didn't trust the city. It was a den of sin, filled with decadence and immorality, and they feared me getting corrupt and taking away from my faith.
I was a very obedient girl and did everything my parents wanted. I never gave them trouble. There were no parties, drinking, or sneaking out of the house.
Our little town wasn't very excited anyway, so I was safe.
Like I said, I had just graduated from college and moved back home to teach at my old high school.
My parents were glad to have me back, but it didn't take long to start discussing marriage and marriage prospects. They wanted me to find a good church boy and settle down. It didn't matter to them that I was a little young, at twenty, thinking of marriage.
Every girl I attended school with was married and had a second child. I didn't want that kind of life, and none of the boys in our small town aroused any spark in me.
I believed something was wrong with me because I didn't feel anything for all seventeen of the suitors my mother had set me up with. That is until Billy...
The day we met was like every other day. It was boring and monotonous, but it was also beautiful and sunny.
I had gone to the grocery store to get things for dinner, as the pantry and fridge had run empty. I turned from the aisle where I had just picked up the milk when I crashed into someone.
I am as skinny as a rail, fighting tooth and nail to put on weight, but it never happened. So when I crashed into this hard surface, I fell to my hip, and there was nothing graceful about my fall.
I moaned in pain and looked up to scream at the blind person, not watching where they were going, but the words got stuck in my throat as my green eyes beheld the most gorgeous face I had ever seen.
No, I have only seen it on the cover of magazines or in the movies.
I could only gawk as my heart fluttered like a hummingbird in my chest.
Here is a man I will willingly follow to the end of the earth.
""Are you alright, Miss?""
I do not know how often he said the words before they penetrated the fog I was locked in.
I flushed bright red when I realised how much I was staring. ""Pardon me."" I tried to rise from the ground, but he quickly offered his hand.
I laid mine on it, and the sparks felt like a live wire near water.
""Apology is mine to offer,"" he said with a charming smile and twinkling blue eyes, and there and there, I lost my heart for him.
Long story short, Billy wined and dined me into marriage within three months of his arrival in town. He was a real estate agent who had come into town to purchase a property. He was ten years older than me, but who was counting? I was in love; nothing else mattered.
Ten years later, we live in our home with three kids afoot. Billy is doing so well in his career that he started his own real estate business, and I am doing everything I can to support him and take care of our kids.
Yep, I am a housewife and proud to be so.
The alarm bell goes off, and I immediately open my eyes to greet the new day.
It is Monday.
Billy is snoring softly beside me, not disturbed by the alarm clock. I leaned over to smooch his stubby cheek and got out of bed.
I want to say that things are perfect in our marriage, but that will be a lie.
Billy works more now and comes home late or not at all. As for our physical relationship?
Well.
I am not complaining, though. No marriage is perfect. Billy does his best to provide for me and the kids. He has always been hardworking, which is one of the reasons I fell in love with him, and I am still in love with him.
The wooden stairs of our home creaked under the  weight of my feet as I made my way downstairs. I walked into the kitchen and turned on the coffee machine.
That is my dope. I definitely won't survive without its kick in the morning. Or any other time of the day, for that matter.
I am a coffee addict.
I allowed myself some quiet time while I sipped on my coffee. I made my way to the window and drew the curtains apart. I stared into the distance, barely seeing much as it was still dark outside, but I enjoyed being alone in my thoughts.
I would lose this luxury once the kids get up and the buzz and kicks of the day start.
After my coffee, I made sandwiches for the kids and Billy's lunch before returning to wake them.
I knocked on each of my kid's door while yelling
""Wake up, guys! We don't wanna be late!""
Getting the kids ready and off on time can sometimes be challenging. That is because of our youngest, Sophie, who is a little dynamo and super active.
I knocked on the boys' door before moving on to the last door in the hallway. The kids have their rooms separate from Billy and me.
I opened Sophie's door and walked to find her sprawled like a monkey, her blonde tresses all over her pillow, and her chubby face softened in sleep.
My heart melted with love at the sight of her. I went to her bedside, leaned down, and gently smooched her forehead to wake her up.
She grumbled words that didn't make sense and returned to sleep.
There is only one way to get her up.
I lifted her off the bed, slightly straining under her weight and then stood her on the ground.
She mumbled and opened her eyes to look at me. Although they were slightly dull from sleep, it felt like staring into a mirror.
""Mummy,"" she mumbled sleepily, rubbing her eyes with the back of her hand.
""Yes, baby, it is time to get ready for school."" I lead her into the bathroom. She has hers, while her brothers share.
""Are you awake enough, honey, to shower?""
She nodded as she sat down on the toilet to pee. Assured she would get ready, I left her in the bathroom and went downstairs again to start breakfast.
David, my eldest, was the first to come down, looking handsome and dashing in his uniform.
""Morning, sweetheart.""
""Morning, Mum,"" David greeted before setting out the plates for breakfast.
David is a gangly nine-year-old with my facial features and his father's height.
Yeah, Billy didn't waste time knocking me up.
My second was the next to join us in the kitchen at the breakfast table. He is seven, and his name is Josh. He is the exact copy of his father: tall, dark brown curly hair and blue eyes that twinkle with mischief.
Billy came down next, dressed for work; he made his way to me and smooched me on the cheek before going to the coffee machine.
I dished the pancakes I had made for everyone and set them on the table. Then, I removed the orange juice and placed it in the centre.
Sophie has yet to come down.
""Eat up, guys. Your bus will soon be here,"" I told my older kids before returning to see what kept my last child.
""Sophie, are you ready?!"" I called out, walking into her room. I didn't see the five-year-old anywhere in her princess bedroom, so I went to the bathroom.
I stifled my laughter when I found her dosing on the toilet seat.
""Sophie!"" I gently shook her to wake her. She was going to be late.
""I am sorry, mum didn't mean to do off.""
""Is alright, baby."" I pulled her nightwear off and helped her into the shower.
When we returned downstairs, her brothers and their father finished their meal, and the school bus just honked.
I went to the boys' lunch, packed them inside their school bags, and sent them off with a smooch on the forehead.
""Looks like I will be dropping you off today, young lady,"" I said to Sophie, who had already sat at the breakfast table and polished off her brother's leftovers.
My daughter likes to eat pancakes, which is her favourite food.
I took out her brother's plate and placed hers in front of her, which had almost the same amount as Josh's.
""I am leaving, honey!"" Billy yelled from the living room.
""Wait!"" I hurried out to meet him at the door.
""Will you be home for dinner?""
Billy shook his head.
""I'm sorry, honey. There is tons of work to do. You know we are just starting. There are a lot of things that need to be taken care of.""
Billy's real estate business has been up and running for eight months, yet he keeps giving the excuse of having too much work on his desk as the reason for missing dinner. This will be the fourth one in a row. It is becoming frequent, which is making me worry. Our children need their father at home. I understand he is working hard to provide for us. Still...
I miss him.
He saw the disappointment on my face, apologised, like he always does, and then promised that things would soon settle down, but they never seemed to.
He came around to my side, pecked me on my lips, and hurried out of the door without saying the three-letter words.
He doesn't bother with them anymore.
I guess we have left the honeymoon stage of our marriage.
I try not to let Billy's strange behaviour bother me. I trust him and know that he loves me.
I went back to Sophie, who was done eating her food. I got her to rinse her mouth, and we left the house for me to drop her.
The day went as usual: I made breakfast, sent the kids to school, and sent Billy to work. I came home clean and did laundry. I waited for the kids to come back, helped them with their homework, made dinner, and then stared at the head of the table where Billy's chair sat empty.
Tonight, there was a slight change in the norm. For some crazy reason, I decided to visit Billy at work.
I packed some dinner, shipped the kids to my neighbour and friend, and drove to Billy's workplace.
The security was kind enough to point me toward Billy's office when I told him who I was. I haven't been here before.
As I drew closer to Billy's office, strange noises drifted towards me, which alarmed me. Thinking my husband was in trouble, I ran to his office door and threw it open to come face to face with my husband with his pants around his ankles drilling some blonde on his desk.",1,1728854458.0,romancenovels,2,1.0,False

————————

My nu de-colored Christian Louboutin pumps smack the pavement in a rhythmic click-clack as I cross the busy Manhattan Street. My long, honey-blonde hair tickles my back as it bounces against my  shoulder blades and my peach Chanel sundress flutters in the warm spring breeze. There is a bounce in my step today that cannot be deterred. Taxi cabs honk their horns and clog the streets – highlighting them in yellow – as they rush people to meetings and business lunches. Thick, black clouds of exhaust pollute the air as buses whoosh by. Vendors call out and advertise asinine prices on fake Gucci sunglasses and Louis Vuitton and Hermes Birkin handbags. Tourists pack the sidewalks while they take pictures at popular landmarks like the Empire State Building, Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center.
Any other day I would have been annoyed by the traffic and the fact that it takes thirty minutes and twenty hard earned dollars to go two miles, and I would have taken my aggression out on an underserving punching bag – but today is different. Today I got the best news an intern could ask for, and as I ascend the stairs to my beautiful, million-dollar, Upper East Side townhome, I start to contemplate the best restaurant to celebrate my good news.
As I unlock the front door and type in the code to the security system, excitement bubbles inside of me, and threatens to boil over.
""Hello?"" I call out. I can't stop smiling as I step out of my heels and place my keys onto the cherrywood end table in the spacious foyer. ""Will? Are you home? I have news!""
"" !"" I hear a voice hiss from upstairs.
My excitement quickly turns to fear as the thud of footsteps and a thunderous crash echo against the high ceilings in the main stairwell. I hold my breath and my eyes frantically dart around the room as I search for any sign of an intruder. Will and I live in a safe neighborhood, and invested in a top-notch security system, but this is New York. Safe is never safe enough.
""Um...hello?"" I call out again. My voice comes out weak and unsteady. ""Will, is that you?""
Another crash. More agitated whispers.
Are we seriously being robbed in broad daylight?
My chest tightens and the quickening of my heartbeat is so pronounced it feels like the beat drop of an EDM song is being played beneath my breastbone. I draw my phone from my purse as I begin to climb the stairs – wondering briefly if I should have grabbed a knife from the kitchen or ran outside and called 911 – and pull up Will's contact.
I'll probably be dead by the time he arrives, but I've seen enough episodes of I Survived. I have to at least try.
The wooden steps creak underneath my  feet as I near the top of the staircase. My breath comes out in weak bursts. A flood of emotions rush through me – Fear. Uneasiness. Anger. Helplessness – and I begin to slowly creep back down the stairs, changing my mind about taking on the intruder on my own, but my heart drops and I freeze when I hear the familiar ring of Will's phone come from our bedroom.
""What are you doing?"" I hear him ask, his voice a harsh whisper. ""Put your    clothes on. My wife is home!""
My lips feel dry, and I stick out my tongue to wet them. I struggle to catch a breath with each rise and fall of my chest. The door is closed over, and I already know what I'm going to find, but that doesn't soften the blow when I push it open and see Will rushing to get dressed.
""What   is this?"" I ask.
"" . Delaney, I can explain. This...this isn't what it looks like.""
Anger rolls through me and I feel my entire body begin to tremble. This isn't what it looks like? Is he serious? I just caught him with his pants down – literally – and he has the nerve to tell me it isn't what it looks like?
Does he honestly think I'm that stupid?
He pulls up his black Tommy John boxer briefs and rushes to my side, his feet tangling in the throw blanket I drape over the edge of the bed in the process. I glower at him as he reaches out and wraps his fingers around my biceps, holding me in place. The moment I feel his hands touch my skin I want to vomit.
Where were his hands ten minutes ago?
""Get off me!"" I shout. I rip my arms from his tight grip and back away from him. ""Don't    touch me. Just...get away from me.""
""Okay, okay. I'm sorry."" He holds his hands up in surrender and sighs. ""I know this looks bad, but I swear it's not what you think.""
""That's funny, because it looks a lot like you're  fck someone who isn't me!""
""I'm not...that's not what this is,"" he denies.
""You're lying, Will! I caught you, and you don't even have the decency to be honest with me? Not to mention you're undressed. So, if you're not having an affair, what are you doing?""
""If you'd just let me –""
""How could you do this to us?"" I interrupt. ""To me? We've been married six months, Will. Six months! And with your assistant? Could you be more of a cliché?""
""I'm more than his assistant,"" she states.
Chelsea, Will's personal assistant of two years, cowers in the corner of our bedroom like a scared cat. She'd tried to cover her undressed, five-foot-two body with the one thousand-thread count bedsheets I recently purchased at Saks Fifth Ave, but she'd done a poor job, and all I can do is stare at her perfectly round  chests. Voluminous auburn hair cascades past her pale shoulders and down her slender back. Delicate clusters of freckles decorate her button nose, and her forest green eyes are cautious as she stares back at me.
It takes every ounce of control I have not to close the small distance between us and wrap my fingers around her skinny, fornicating neck.
""You're not allowed to speak,"" I say, my voice low and menacing, and unrecognizable even to me. ""Ever.""
""Sweetie, please let me explain. I messed up, okay? I know that, but if you would just listen to me for a minute –""
""No! I don't wanna hear anything you have to say. In fact, I want you to leave. I want you out. Now!""
I glance around our bedroom for the first time since I burst in and my eyes blur with tears. Our California King bed – that I made before I left for work since Will hates getting into an unmade bed – is torn apart. The decorative pillows we playfully argue over are strewn about the room. The fitted sheet has been pulled off completely and is laying in a heap at the foot of the bed, and the white, goose-down comforter is draped over the bedpost. Their clothes are all over the place, there's an empty protection wrapper on Will's nightstand and the lamp on the side where I sleep is on the floor – broken beyond repair.
""Actually, you know what, I'll leave,"" I say. I wipe the tears from my cheeks with my fingertips and dry them on the front of my dress, leaving streaks of mascara on the delicate fabric. ""I can't...I can't be here. I can't be in this house right now. Not with you.""
""Come on, sweetie. Where are you gonna go?""
""I'll go to Nico's.""
""Absolutely not. If you go there and tell him what happened, he'll never let you come back. Just stay. Please,"" he begs. He steps in front of me, blocking the doorway so I can't get through, and takes my hands in his. His touch is warm and familiar, and when we lock eyes, I know we both can feel the fight in me beginning to weaken. ""Just stay and we can talk about it. You're upset, and it's my fault, but I need to explain. Let me get her out of here and you and I will sit down and talk. Okay?""
I stare him down. His black boxer briefs rest low on his slender hips. His dirty blonde hair is a tangled mess, nothing like his usual, perfectly styled hairdo. Scratches on his  chest and shoulders – put there, I can only assume, by the fingernails of his houseguest – are already fading. His full lips are red and swollen and there's pink lipstick smeared on his neck.
She's all over him.
I shake my head and chuckle sardonically as I look at my husband and wonder how the   we got here. I thought we were happy.
""Fine. Take care of your guest and I'll meet you outside,"" I say. My stomach rolls with nausea. ""I need some air.""
Almost forty-five minutes later, I sit on the front steps of our once happy home as I wait for Will to come back from helping Chelsea catch a cab. She didn't put up much of a fight – not once I told her I'd skin her alive and use her hide as a rug if she didn't leave. The truth is though, I'm not mad at her. Not entirely. Will is handsome and charming. He exudes power and importance, and he's the type of person that when he walks into a room, everyone takes notice. He has money and no problem flaunting how much. The dimples that dent his cheeks and his friendly, golden brown eyes are enough to make any girl melt. I fell for it too, so I can't blame her.
At least I think I can't.
""Quite a day, huh?"" Will asks, as he sits down next to me.
""Yeah. You could say that."" I pick up the hem of my dress and begin gliding it between my fingers. ""How long?""
""Sweetie, I don't wanna hurt you anymore than I already have. Can't we just –""
""Will, I came home from work today and found you in bed with another woman. The least you can do is be honest with me."" I drop my chin in my hand and turn to him. ""I deserve the truth.""
He rubs his hands together and stays quiet as he keeps his focus forward. Like it'll hurt him to look at me. Like he never meant for this to happen, and he knows once we make eye contact, it'll be real. But Will doesn't do anything he doesn't want to do, and I need to remember that if I'm going to get through this conversation with any dignity.
""It started in December.""
""December?"" I bark out a laugh. Not because any of this is funny, but because this has been going on behind my back for five months, and I feel like an idiot. ""That was a month after our wedding.""
""Yeah. It happened the first time at the Christmas party for the firm. I was upset because you couldn't make it to another work function. You promised you'd be there, and then bailed on me for, I don't know, your internship or something."" He waves his hand in the air like my work isn't important – like I collect butterflies for a living. ""I started drinking. Chelsea found me in my office, one thing led to another and before I knew it, we'd slept together.""
My mind wanders back to that night. I'd gone into work early so I could leave in time to make it to the party but Calvin, my boss, had a deadline and it was either stay and help, or lose my job. I'd gotten home late, and I was exhausted. So, I took a hot shower, poured myself a glass of drink and was asleep thirty minutes later. When I woke up Will wasn't there, and from the look of the empty spot next to me, he hadn't made it home. I was worried sick. He'd never not come home before, so when he walked through the front door in one piece, I breathed a sigh of relief.
""You told me you stayed at Charlie's that night. That you went to his place after the party and passed out,"" I say. ""Where did you really stay?""
He drags his hands down his face and scratches the back of his neck nervously. ""I stayed at Chelsea's.""
""Oh, my God."" Bile rises in my throat, and I press the back of my hand against my mouth as I swallow it down. ""I feel sick.""
""It was only supposed to happen once, but we just kept finding ourselves alone together. Call it a coincidence, or a well thought out plan on her part, but she always seemed to be available when you weren't. First, it was the holiday party, and then drinks for my thirtieth birthday. Then we had the Legal Marketing Conference in March, the Bedlam Conference in April and the Atticus Summit a few weeks ago. I wanted you to come, but you had an excuse as to why you couldn't be at every single one of them. Chelsea was there. I tried to stop after that first time, but I couldn't. I was weak.""
""You were weak?"" I ask. ""That sounds like an excuse.""
""Believe what you want. It's the truth.""
I run my fingers through my blonde curls and let out a shaky breath as I watch neighbors and New York City visitors walk down our busy street. At one time I thought my life was like theirs – A couple in love catching a cab for date night. Friends heading into the city for dinner and drinks. A guy and a girl out for a stroll on a warm, spring evening – but I'm quickly learning that it isn't the Hallmark movie I thought it was. It's more of a Lifetime Movie Network nightmare.
""Why?"" I ask.
""I don't wanna talk about this anymore,"" he says. He turns to me – finally making eye contact – and tucks my hair behind my ear. My body betrays me and goosebumps decorate my skin as the tips of his fingers brush across my cheek. ""Now that you know we can just move on and forget this ever happened.""
""Forget it ever happened?"" I push his hand away and wrap my arms around myself. ""You slept with another woman. Tell me why, Will. Tell me now why you cheated, or I swear to God I'll pack my bags and you'll never see me again. Tell me!""
""You're never home, Delaney! You spend all your time either at work or with Nico and Sloan. You're so focused on them and your job, it's like nothing and no one else exists. It's just an internship, and not even a good one.""
I'm taken aback by his reasoning. He's the one who encouraged I take the job in the first place, and now he's holding it against me?
He's got balls. Big, hypocritical, brass balls.
""Need I remind you it's an internship you urged me to take,"" I snap.
""I know, but I didn't think an internship would take up so much of your time. I come home to an empty house almost every night, and when I ask where you are, nine out of ten times you're still at work. I can't tell you how much Netflix I've watched over the past few months, or how much take-out I've eaten, since you're never home to cook. When we got married, I thought I'd be coming home to my wife, a warm meal on the table – ready to eat – and then we'd spend time together, but that's not how it's been.""
I wrinkle my brow as I slowly turn my head to look at him. ""It's the twenty-first century, Will. Women don't stay home anymore. Especially women who don't have kids. And I'm sorry to tell you this now, but I'll never be the woman who stays home and cleans all day in a hoop skirt, a set of pearls and a full face of make-up, with dinner on the table and a glass of bourbon in her hand as she waits for her husband to come home from work. I want a career. I've always wanted a career, and you knew that going into this marriage – this relationship.""
""You're right,"" he agrees. ""I guess I didn't know I wanted a life like that until I didn't have it.""
I release a sigh of complete exasperation and tuck my hair behind my ears. ""I don't understand. Do you want me to be a passive, little Stepford wife? Is that what you want?""
""No! Of course not.""
""Then what, Will? I need you to tell me what to do here because I just...I don't know what you want from me.""
""I thought my days of living like a single guy were over! I thought I had a partner for life, but this –"" He gestures his finger between the two of us – ""isn't what I thought marriage would be like. This isn't what I pictured for my life. The worst part is though..."" He rests his elbows on his knees and looks me dead in the eyes. ""I feel like you have this whole other life that I'm not a part of. I'm – I'm lonely.""
When he puts is that way, can I blame him for having an affair?
His voice is thick with emotion, his eyes glassy with unshed tears, and it breaks my heart to know that the pain he's in and the loneliness he feels is because of me. We're in this situation because I'm selfish and I've been so wrapped up in my own life that I set him aside and haven't taken the time to show him how much I love and appreciate him. I can't blame anyone but myself for the fact that he felt the need to seek attention from another woman, because it's all my fault.
I got my internship at Posh Magazine a little over four years ago. Will and I were financially set when I was offered the position and he convinced me to take the job, as it would be a good idea to start as an intern and earn their trust as I work my way up. Although it's been more of me getting coffee for the staff, picking up my bosses dry-cleaning and making reservations for business dinners that I know are actually dates, and it's not exactly what I thought I'd be doing at twenty-eight years old, it's been a dream come true.
But is a dream worth it if you hurt the people you love along the way?
""I'm sorry,"" I whisper. I drop my tear-filled eyes to my hands as I anxiously twist my gorgeous two carat, Oval Halo Tiffany & Co engagement ring around my finger. ""I never meant to hurt you. I understand why you're lonely, and I know I'm to blame, but you should have talked to me about it instead of sleeping with someone else. You should have come to me with your concerns. We could have figured it out together.""
He leans back and places his hand on my thigh. ""I'm sorry too. You were never supposed to find out this way. I planned on telling you eventually.""
""Eventually?"" I ask. I chuckle condescendingly. ""How considerate of you.""
""You know what I mean.""
""Do..."" I inhale sharply and wipe the snot from my nose with the back of my hand. ""Do you love her?""
Will's shoulders slump as he lets out a heavy – almost defeated – sigh and drops his chin to his chest.
I've always said that Will is easy to read because his eyes are so expressive. I know when he's happy and when he's sad, when he's just a little annoyed and when he's completely irate. I know when he's excited because their golden-brown color deepens to a rich, shaded, almost gingerbread undertone, and they crinkle in the corners when he smiles. I know he's concentrating when he closes his left eye and wrinkles his nose, and when he's turned on, they're almost black. I've spent the last seven years with him, and I know if he would just look at me, I'd have the answer to my question, but if today has taught me anything, it's that I may not know my husband as well as I think I do.
My heart begins to race. I stare at Will's perfect profile as I anticipate his answer, but the longer we sit in silence, the more I feel like I may actually spontaneously combust. My breath bursts through my parted lips in hard, unsteady gusts, and just as I open my mouth to tell him to forget I asked, he turns to me and frowns.
""I don't know,"" he says. ""Maybe – I don't – I have no idea how I feel. I love you so much, Delaney. If you don't believe anything else I've said today, please believe that. I don't know what I feel for Chelsea, or if it's real, but what I do know is that I want to stay married to you. So, whatever I need to do to fix this, I'll do it.""
Not exactly what I wanted to hear, but it's a maybe, not a yes. I can work with maybe.
""Okay, so, what do we do now?""
""I don't know. I'm just...I'm so confused right now,"" he says. A tear rolls down his cheek and I have to tuck my hands under my legs so I don't reach out and wipe it away. ""Maybe we should – I don't know...take a few days. I think some space will help me figure things out. It'll give us both a clear head.""
Every sound around me turns fuzzy – like I've been hit by an ocean wave and sucked underneath the water – and all I can do is close my eyes and focus on the erratic exhales that fall from my lips unwillingly. I tuck my hair behind my ears with shaky fingers. My heart thuds against my ribcage and beads of cold sweat erupt along the back of my neck. No matter how hard I try to focus, everything around me seems to move in slow motion.
Will Anderson – My safe space. My confidant. My husband – the man I fell in love with the second I laid eyes on him, wants space so he can figure out if he's in love with the woman he's been having an affair with for the last five months, and there's absolutely nothing I can do about it?

1g2zye6,https://www.reddit.com/r/blendedfamilies/comments/1g2zye6/im_just_not_sure_about_this_one/,I’m just not sure about this one.,"Hello, I f(27) have been dating my boyfriend m(23) for almost a year now. I have 3 kids from a previous relationship. He is new to dating a mom, but he comes from a big family (well big to me), as he is the oldest of 4. There aren’t any younger children in his household, and all of his siblings were born a year apart from eachother. We have a good relationship and want the same goals with eachother long term but when it comes to his family, and my kids, I’m just not sure anymore. 

He argues with my 6 year old, and is always trying to place himself above her like a power trip, and I always have to call him out or tell him to stop, he doesn’t listen. I’ve expressed how much I don’t like that at all. Says I’m being ridiculous for telling him off, when he’s literally arguing with a 6 year old. His family argues this way too, and belittles him because he’s their child. 

He doesn’t understand how children are, especially how attentive you have to be with you’re with my son, who is 3 and has autism. He runs, and doesn’t understand that. He doesn’t understand that it’s okay to have left overs, he always eats their left overs even though my older kids express they are saving it for later or for tomorrow. He even yelled at me for throwing away an ice coffee he bought bc there was ice coffee water at the bottom (you know, nasty stuff). 

I don’t know if this is all stemmed in how he was raised, and how this is not how I want to raise my children. He’s expressed to me that children don’t get to have a say or opinion on things, and I think that’s the most toxic thing ever, but when I go to his house, his dad belittles him and he still has the heart to say I love you to his dad after he freaked out on him for no reason. They treat him like a teenager and he’s so used to it at this point that he’s fine with it. 

I’m just not sure about this relationship, I feel he needs to go to therapy or something if he wants this relationship to continue.. but am I an ass for saying this? I give him grace because he is younger than me.. I worry it’s all too much for him but he says this is what he wants. He says it’s okay, everything is okay and I feel like it’s not. His family is very much a “what’s yours is mine” mindset, a “pack” if you will, and I told him if we were to ever get married, he’d have to leave this mindset and he insists that I move in with him and stay in his area, which I’m not doing bc I’m already well established where I am (we live an hour and a half away from eachother). 

I’m not mentally prepared to leave this relationship, as he is the only one who’s stuck by me and wants a future with me, but idk if this is just him being naive or doing charity being with a mom with 3 kids… I just don’t know. Some things can be teachable or something learned, but I feel like he’s doing so much learning. I’ve asked him to see a therapist, at least one session, but instead he talks to this guy once a week on the phone called the “trev program” or something, it’s like a life coaching thing idk, but I don’t think that’s actually helpful.

I’ll try to cut this short to avoid a novel so I’ll detail our relationship and then why she thinks she’s a victim and then what I told her to her face.

Our relationship; I (m22) met her (f19) on a dating app and we met soon after, we had a good thing going for about 3 months but she began to develop a drinking problem, I was very honest with her and said if it got bad I wouldn’t he able to handle it and so she went to rehab.

During this time she texted me saying “if you want to move on you can…” and would every day tell me how much she hates that I’m “making her” go to therapy or rehab. 

She came back and was better but a bit more rude and slightly passive aggressive, we had always joked about “fighting” starting with her one night jokingly saying she’d “wrap me around a pole” and on the second night back she said “oh I’ll slap you” while I was fixing something and i replied “I’ll deck ya”in a calm tone 

She ran off to another room and started crying on the phone to her mum and boom a week later her family and friends where calling me an abuser.

Why she thinks she’s a victim: she accused me of “abusive” language when she would annoy me around the time she was in rehab, I have a demanding job that requires me to get a good amount of sleep, and she would phone me constantly, never letting me get any shut eye, I would lose my temper often bc I was getting 4 hours of sleep max.

How I told her she wasn’t a victim: one night I drove down to hers during family time and we all chilled but I could tell it was off. It was a few days after the incident but she told me everyone was fine with me.

Boom I’m in the kitchen making a coffee and I hear them talking about, enough was enough and I got my shit on and walked in and basically just said “no you think because I’m not afraid to talk back to you and put up with your shit that I’m an abuser, we’re done here” and I drove home

The girl almost caused a car crash bc she phoned me so many times on the way. 

I blocked her and she spam texted and called me on no caller id’s for weeks before stopping.

I should have gotten a few things done. Instead, I went to the bathroom and stayed in it for 5 hours looking at my phone. I felt like staying up and showering was so boring that I just couldn't convince myself to do it, no matter how hard I tried.

After that, I went to bed and didn't leave my phone until 4am, staring at the screen like my life depended on it.

In the morning I went to the market to enjoy the last sunny day with good coffee and food, and tried to focus on the good parts of life instead of holding on to something that was knocking me down. But I felt like crap. I talked and smiled and tried to ignore the screaming in my chest. I felt like I was lost forever, that my body didn't belong to me, that I was trying to cheer myself up but it was only getting worse. And trying not to let things throw me off has turned into endlessly pretending I'm okay. I smile, but inside I feel despair. Makes me feel terribly lonely.

I try to keep a positive attitude and not judge myself if I lose my way, but lately I feel like real life is so disruptive and boring that the only thing that makes me feel better and has any value is my phone. Logically I realize this is not true, but my brain disagrees.

Do you have a good tactic to get back on track? How do you get rid of the paralysis and the shame that occurs during it???

Sometimes I think that my life is so messed up that any crappie outcome is great enough. This way I can keep my expectations low and start taking action. But that doesn't always work and I'm really really tired of feeling so worthless.

1g2zw13,https://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/1g2zw13/wanting_to_meet_laoc_entrepreneurs_for_meaningful/,Wanting to meet la/oc entrepreneurs for meaningful chats,"**About me:**

Honestly, I don’t feel like much of an “entrepreneur.” I see myself more as someone running a “small hustle.” I started my own consumer goods brand back when I was in grad school (social sciences) and ended up sticking with it. Seven years have gone by, and my business is still small, with a handful of employees and revenue’s in the seven figures. But it’s definitely been a mix of “making money feels easy” and “wow, money is hard to make.” Now things are relatively stable. Most of my experience has been from self-learning and piecing things together.

**What I’d really like to talk about:**

**Keeping motivated** - I’m finding this harder than I expected. At the start, every day was fueled by passion, but now… there are mornings where I have to push myself just to get out the door. My therapist thinks I’m dealing with burnout, though I’m not sure if that’s really what’s going on.

**Hiring and managing -** Most of what I know about leading a team, I’ve learned from books and podcasts, plus some old-school advice from my dad on how he managed his employees back in China (some of which I’m pretty sure would be frowned upon here). I’d love to learn from others on how to find and keep good people without all the trial and error.

**Some personal experiences** - I’ve had some odd experiences in trying to learn the ropes. Once, I spent 30 minutes at an Amazon warehouse to get a taste of warehouse life before immediately quitting. A few weeks later, I got a paycheck for $700, most of which was a “quit bonus.”

**Other topics I’d be interested in** - I’m into reading (Derek Sivers, Cal Newport), exploring ideas around personal growth, thinking about future family plans (no kids yet), commercial real estate, tax planning, automation, rock climbing, water sports, maybe even moving out of California… really, anything that could bring a bit more lightness to the whole work-life equation.

If any of this resonates with you, I’d love to grab a coffee and hear about your experiences, too.

Any help or suggestions are appreciated, I'm drying it out rn but I put it in a jar of rice while I get ready in the morning before I put them in (about 20-30 minutes every day). I don't get what the fuck happened and I'm not excited if I have to get a new one bc i can't afford that right now.

We both jumped right into it and were very attracted to each other and laid everything out and understood we both wanted a long term relationship. Our first date we went and just sat outside a coffee shop and talked for hours ending with us making out in her car. Then, after that she kind of gets distant with me because she was mad at herself for letting her guard down and making out with me. I told her it wasn’t my intentions to just hook up with her and talked her off the ledge. She calls me everyday, texts everyday but cancelled two straight dates on me and never rescheduled. She ends up telling me she created a tinder the night we hung out because she has her doubts but it bothered me a little just because we established what we’re both looking for. Then she finally asks to come see me at my house and we sit in her car and make out and things are getting hot. She doesn’t want to come inside because she said she knows it would escalate and says let’s save it for another time. Afterwards, she calls me and tells me she has been having sex with another guy and she really likes me and doesn’t want to add me to her body count just yet because she was sexually active with another guy and admits that’s the reason she didn’t want to go inside. I then tell her I want to cut ties and to keep having sex with the other guy. I feel like she’s wasting my time and I felt like those two situations were enough of a red flag for me not to want to talk to her and engage anymore. I’m not a controlling person but why waste my time and talk shit about men being pigs because all they want to do is hook up.

Last person I approached to hang out went from ""let's go fishing"" to something much raunchier. Not looking for that. While my sense of humor is inappropriate I'm not looking to pass the time that way.

Where to begin? I'm 37 years old, live in the South end of town, and have realized that over the years my social circle has shrunk to mostly being my dogs. Which are great, but suck at cards.

I am a huge nerd, but spent most of my life either on ranches or in auto shops so I have a lot of interests. I currently am running a 5e campaign as the DM, my wife and I collected about 40 board games during the pandemic, I love hiking and backpacking, fishing as I mentioned ( but not a lot of catching), I belong to the local cave club so if you want to go underground I can help set that up. I can grill pretty well, and I'm trying to always be a better cook. I love food, so checking out new places is always interesting to me. I disc golf off and on, and was bouldering for a couple years pretty frequently. I love horror movies, and listen to a wide variety of music but mostly metal and punk. I say that as I'm listening to the Witcher soundtrack though.

I don't know what I'm looking for really, but I know I'm tired of not having people in my life. Maybe a few friend to kick around in the woods with, or a group of people to have a couple drinks and try to save the world with. Hell maybe I'll just find someone to grab a coffee with but I need human interaction outside of work. ",2,1728852986.0,austinfriends,4,1.0,False

However, most coffee shops offer iced caffe lattes, while a traditional caffe latte is intended to be made with steamed milk and milk foam. So, while I agree that an iced cappuccino cannot be made in adherence to the standards of a traditional Italian cappuccino, I question why iced cappuccino order-ers are looked at with so much disdain while modern coffee culture largely accepts the idea of an iced latte. If a latte can be made iced with espresso and cold milk, why is an iced cappuccino (with equal parts espresso, cold milk, and cold foam) not acceptable? I would argue that this is even closer to the expectation of a cappuccino than an iced latte is to a hot latte because of the inclusion of foam.

1g2zkna,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g2zkna/sonder/,Sonder,"There's a word in the Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows.  You might have seen it, it's been shared as a meme or on various ""Words You Should Know"" type lists.  ""Sonder.""  It means the realization that every passerby has a life as vivid and complex as your own.

I have it.  Or have some terrible, twisted version of it.

When I say I ""have it"" I don't mean I'm aware that everyone has a full and rich life.  No I mean I know what they've done.

I know it.  I'm in a coffee shop typing this.  I know the guy who just walked in and ordered a latte beats his wife.  He beat her three nights ago.  A two weeks ago.  And about two or three times a month on average since they've been married. Two years ago he beat her so hard she miscarried.

There's red pickup in the parking lot next door, it's a standard franchise auto parts store.  The old man in the cab was a Klan member in the 70s.  Beat two black men to death over nothing and never got caught.

I know every horrible thing anyone I'm within about... I dunno I guess about 50 yards of me at any given moment, has ever done.

But that's not the bad part.  As soon as the bad things they've done pops in my head, it's followed by the good.

The guy who's picking his latte from the barista right now beats his wife.  But also volunteers on a suicide hot line.  He's saved 37 lives from suicide.

The old racist killer in the pickup next door?  Donated a kidney to a stranger 8 years ago.  Saw on the news some news story that some guy needed kidney, and on a lark he went and saw if he was a match.  He was.  Saved the guys life.

And it's not always big things.  Hell it's rarely big things.  There's not as many monsters walking among us as the cynics and doomsayers would have us believe.  Most people try to do good.  Mr. Wife Beater sipping his latte by the window is sadly too common but the Hood in the cab of the pickup is a pretty rare anomaly, at least in how far he took it.

The lady at the table next to me is just a jerk.  Screams at cashiers when her coupon is expired and never returns her shopping card.  And she defended her daughter from the rest of the family when she came out as a lesbian.  The hipster guy locking his bike to the bike rack outside cheats on his girlfriend, but works a soup kitchen.

I know what you're thinking.  ""But this is wonderful.  You see the good side of everyone!""  And sure for the Karen at the next table and Hipster Bike Dude maybe it is a good kind of perspective.  But the coffee guy wife beater and the hate crimer in the truck?  The good they did didn't outweigh the bad, not even close.

And if it was just thoughts, I could manage it.

But 3 years ago I was coming back with my wife from running errands.  We startled a guy who was trying to break into our house.  He had 3 felony warrants for armed robbery and he knew he would die in prison if he got caught again.  I knew, maybe before he did, that he was going to knock my wife down to get past her to run away.

But I also knew that he was robbing my house to feed his family.  So I paused.  I just stood there.  And he shoved my wife and ran off.  My wife hit her head on the concrete step and died.

I'm not trying to tell anyone that seeing the good side of people is bad.  That's absurd.  It's nothing that simplistic and black and white.  Even the worst of us are complete human being, my experience had convinced me of that.

But people do horrible thing that don't get outweighed by the good they do.  There are people walking around who even the most compassionate among us would be comfortable labeling monsters who shouldn't be just free in society.

But being always aware of the evil that people do and then on top of that having this... voice in your head constantly playing devil's advocate for the it.  I don't know if I can put into words how that makes you feel.  It's like universe is trying to tell you that the pain and misery these people caused doesn't matter.  It hurts.  It hurts bad.

If this was some stupid comic book I'd become a vigilante, using my magical psychic powers to hunt down evil doers but... whatever I have just doesn't make me want to do that.  It just makes me depressed and tired.

Look for the good in everyone.  I mean that sincerely and unironically.  But be grateful you don't have a voice in your head forcing you to do it, even when you shouldn't.",7,1728852822.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1g2zj2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1g2zj2o/i_ghosted_my_best_friend/,I ghosted my best friend ,"I ghosted my best friend

So, it’s been a while since this all happened, but it’s been on my mind this past week. I ghosted my ‘best friend’ after seven years of friendship.

I (26F) ghosted my best friend (25F) earlier this year. I had been thinking about ending the friendship for a while, but honestly, I didn’t know how to go about it. I’m not good at confrontation, and whenever I tried to talk about things that bothered me, they were either flipped back on me or nothing would change.

There were a few reasons that led to me ghosting her, It’s quite a long story, my apologies and I am going to give some context and then some further details on the things towards the end of the friendship.

I became friends with, Emily, when we were 18/19 years old through a mutual. Soon after we became friends, she fell out with our mutual because they got into a relationship. Emily felt left out as they spent less time with her and did more one-on-one things with their girlfriend. She ended up calling them selfish, which pretty much ended their friendship. We remained friends.

Throughout our friendship, I always worked while she didn’t. She had on-and-off job, which meant that sometimes she couldn’t afford to do things, so I either had to pay/lend money for her or she couldn’t come. When she couldn’t, I would receive a message about leaving her out, which made me feel guilty tbh, she would tell me she had no money, and when I did things with other friends, she would accuse me of making more effort with them than with her. In reality, I simply couldn’t afford to pay for both of us all the time. I was okay with this, I had offered to pay for her these were the terms and I did it as I knew she couldn’t afford it and often I wouldn’t even ask for her to pay me back as I knew times were tough and she couldn’t afford it. But it was annoying to have it thrown in my face when I did things without her too, even with separate friends.

She also constantly asked me for lifts. I drove, she didn’t, and she very rarely gave me fuel money, in the first 5 years of our friendship I can’t recall one occasion she gave me fuel money. Once, she rang me to ask if I could take her to a job interview. I was busy and she got angry because she didn’t have time to walk there and was going to be late! But she never asked me for the lift in advance either.

At first, I didn’t mind much because, despite what my other friends and family were telling me—that I was being taken advantage of—I liked her company and defended her, saying she was just going through a tough time, which she was.

When I was 21, I lost my sister. On the morning she passed away, I paid for an Uber for Emily to come over and be with me, and she did, along with another close friend of mine. My close friend was supposed to go on a first date that day but cancelled to come over but he said he would need to leave by 10 p.m. to make it up to his date by bringing her takeout. I appreciated that he went out of his way to be there for me anyway. However, Emily got into an argument with him, calling him selfish and a bad friend. This annoyed me, as it wasn’t her place to say anything. I let it slide.
The day of the funeral, Emily didn’t have money for transport, so I arranged for my friend to pick her up as I was going to be in the car with my family and we needed to meet at the church . She argued with me, saying it was unfair of me to ask my friend to give her a lift because it would make her uncomfortable. This is when I found out about her previous argument with my friend (which my other friend hadn’t mentioned but still agreed to give her the lift!). She ended up taking the lift, but it bothered me she was arguing with me about trying to sort her a lift out a week after my sister died and I was not emotionally okay and I didn’t even know they argued because no one told me. But I forgave her.

Emily got a boyfriend, let’s call him Dave. Dave was a nightmare. He got her kicked out of her house, leaving her homeless. I let her stay at my house, drove them to emergency housing, and helped them move. Emily didn’t have any other friends—I had introduced her to my friendship circle, but none of them got along with her and felt she treated me like a ‘mug.’ Emily and Dave are now both asking me for lifts, money, and favours, still with barely offering anything in return.

During this time, Emily would often take her frustrations with Dave out on me. They would send me constant messages accusing me of things like stealing from them, talking behind their backs, or being sly—none of which were true. Dave would use me as a weapon in their relationship. After some time, Emily realised that Dave was the one lying, not just about that but about a lot of things and it just was a really toxic relationship, really tough, they broke up. Although I was still angry about being falsely accused, I understood the situation and forgave her. After they broke up she was now in a bad place with little friends and relied on me to hang out with her a few evenings a week. She also got a full time job, earning more than I did (this is relevant), but still asked me for lifts. When I said I was busy, she would become upset and question what I was doing and when I’d be free, often asking if I could cancel my plans to help her.

They smoked a lot of weed, and if they ran out, she would repeatedly ring and text me for a lift to pick up more. Once, I was on a date two hours away in Liverpool, and she rang me eight times asking when I was coming back so she could pick up. She continued to message me the entire drive back, which annoyed me because it felt like she expected me to drop everything for her. This wasn’t a one-off; it happened weekly. Throughout our friendship, anyone I dated would eventually get fed up with her because of the way she inserted herself into my relationships, often expecting me to drop everything to help her.

Since she had started her new job, she would get paid weekly and wanted me to take her food shopping every Friday. I didn’t mind but asked her to contribute fuel money, to which she said no. I asked for £10 a month, which she refused, saying it was unfair for her to pay because the shop was ‘two minutes down the road’—even though she lived 25 minutes from my house. She lived around a 25 minute drive from my house, then 11 minutes to the shop, and then another 25 minutes for me to get home. It would cost me more than £10 a month for me to take her food shopping every Friday. She still continued to ask me for lifts after saying no to giving me fuel money. This is around the time period where I was really getting fed up.

I felt Emily only spoke to me when she needed a favour, and when I pointed this out, she started messaging me to ask how I was, only to follow up by asking for a lift. I told her to stop asking for same-day favours and then getting upset when I was busy, but nothing changed.

A few months before I ghosted her, a friend passed away, and a memorial was planned on the same day we were supposed to attend a concert together. I asked if we could reschedule, as I wanted to attend the memorial, but she called me selfish and complained that her plans always get ruined, which wasn’t true. I ended up buying new concert tickets for a different date, but her lack of empathy bothered me. She also knew this friend and claimed to be really upset about the whole situation but then reacted like that? 

Once on the anniversary of my sister’s death, I took the day off work because I was feeling really low. Emily texted to ask what I was doing that evening, and I said I wasn’t doing anything because I was sad. She replied with ‘aw,’ which annoyed me because whenever she was upset, she expected me to listen to her, but when I opened up, all I got was ‘aw’ or ‘that sucks.’ She later asked if I wanted to get coffee, and I was pleasantly surprised, thinking she was trying to be there for me. However, we didn’t get coffee—I think she just wanted me to pick up the guy she was seeing. What bothered me most was that this guy, who I’d only met once, said more about my sister’s death than Emily did. It really upset me that she had clearly told him about my sister but hadn’t been able to express anything to me. It really annoyed me because why can she speak about it to random people about it but not me? Did she tell him she was hanging out with me to be there for me because not one moment of that interaction was her being there for me. I let it slide, thinking it was an emotional day.

The final straw came after we spoke about how I felt like she was only asking me for favours again, she said she felt like I never asked her to do things either, I do admit I did stop asking her to see if she asked me for anything other than favours and well that’s all I got, so we planned to go roller-skating. On the day, she said she had no money, so I suggested rescheduling for a day when I could bring food to her house, and we could cook dinner together. The day came, and she cancelled because a guy from Tinder was coming over. She later messaged me asking if I was free that evening, but I couldn’t, as I was spending time with my little brother as something had came up and I needed to see him that evening. The last few months I got better at putting in boundaries and saying no to unexpected plans as I was feeling overwhelmed and my therapist said I should do this to manage myself better and she had an issue with that I think. Note I did not tell her my therapist told me to do that as I did not want her to think I was saying she was overwhelming me, which she was, but I didn’t want to upset her to I did not tell her that I was enforcing boundaries more for me. Anyway,  I replied saying that isn’t the case I had plans with her the day prior and she cancelled and I am saying I am free on Friday to reschedule, When I explained this, she argued that I should have given her a new date to reschedule the roller-skating when she cancelled, instead of just saying ‘it’s okay, we can reschedule.’ She complained that I was doing more with other people, but in reality, I saw her more than anyone else except my partner. She said it annoying seeing me do things with other people at not her but the only difference here is I stopped paying for her to do things as she now earns more money than me and I have a car to run too and I can’t afford to pay for us both anymore.

She also criticised me for not including my partner in our plans, though she had never asked to spend time with both of us. My partner didn’t want to come along because they didn’t enjoy sitting in the car for hours while I drove Emily around, which I thought was fair enough.

After I told her that I had prioritised our plans for the previous day but was free again on Friday, she replied calling me a ‘piss-poor friend’ and accusing me of being selfish. I didn’t reply.
A few days later, she messaged me again, saying, ‘When I tell you that you’re a bad friend, your response is to ignore me. If it’s that easy to lose me from your life, then fair enough.’ I once again do not reply.

A couple of weeks go by, and now my brother is living with me. I have a family plan on Apple for Apple Music and other services, but Emily is still on my family plan, which means there isn’t space for my brother. So, I remove her.

She texts me again.

She says ‘all I’ve done is complain that you haven’t been a good friend, and that you haven’t made time for me.’ She tells me I need to take a good look in the mirror, calls me materialistic, and says that I’ve finally shown my true colours, adding that I need to grow up.

Once again, I did not reply. I felt like it was rich to call me materastlic when she was arguing with me about removing her from my apple plan. I proceed to remove her from my Disney+ and Netflix subscriptions too as I felt like I should not be paying for someone who speaks to me like that.

I don’t regret ending the friendship, but I do feel bad about ghosting her, especially after such a long time. Part of me wonders if I was wrong for not explaining myself or giving her a proper goodbye.

I feel like I was a good friend to her, I did more for her than I have any of my other friends and it bums me out that it ended the way that it did as I put a lot of time and effort into our friendship and I just felt like she didn't see that I really tried. It hurts me she thinks I did all those things and that I put more time into other friends. Like it really sucks for me I tried so hard to be a good friend to her and she thinks I was really bad? She said multiple times how everyone leaves her and she doesn’t understand why, and I did the exact same thing like I knew she felt the way she did. She already had really low self esteem and questioned why people didn’t stick around - should I have told her my reasons for leaving?

Also I am not saying she wasn't a good friend at times, as she was and this does miss out a lot of details as it was a 7 year friendship but I just couldn't deal with feeling like I was someone's doormat or personal taxi any longer. They was also times I wasn’t a perfect friend either, I don’t want anyone to think that I am but I never once intentionally did or said anything to disrespect her.

1g2zid8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g2zid8/i_ghosted_my_best_friend/,I ghosted my best friend,"So, it’s been a while since this all happened, but it’s been on my mind this past week. I ghosted my ‘best friend’ after seven years of friendship.

I (26F) ghosted my best friend (25F) earlier this year. I had been thinking about ending the friendship for a while, but honestly, I didn’t know how to go about it. I’m not good at confrontation, and whenever I tried to talk about things that bothered me, they were either flipped back on me or nothing would change.

There were a few reasons that led to me ghosting her, It’s quite a long story, my apologies and I am going to give some context and then some further details on the things towards the end of the friendship.

I became friends with, Emily, when we were 18/19 years old through a mutual. Soon after we became friends, she fell out with our mutual because they got into a relationship. Emily felt left out as they spent less time with her and did more one-on-one things with their girlfriend. She ended up calling them selfish, which pretty much ended their friendship. We remained friends.

Throughout our friendship, I always worked while she didn’t. She had on-and-off job, which meant that sometimes she couldn’t afford to do things, so I either had to pay/lend money for her or she couldn’t come. When she couldn’t, I would receive a message about leaving her out, which made me feel guilty tbh, she would tell me she had no money, and when I did things with other friends, she would accuse me of making more effort with them than with her. In reality, I simply couldn’t afford to pay for both of us all the time. I was okay with this, I had offered to pay for her these were the terms and I did it as I knew she couldn’t afford it and often I wouldn’t even ask for her to pay me back as I knew times were tough and she couldn’t afford it. But it was annoying to have it thrown in my face when I did things without her too, even with separate friends.

She also constantly asked me for lifts. I drove, she didn’t, and she very rarely gave me fuel money, in the first 5 years of our friendship I can’t recall one occasion she gave me fuel money.

She reacts as if this is out of nowhere and not the result of a 10-month build of frustrations. 

When she begged me, BEGGED, crying to help her out of her situation - she was as a “stay at home girlfriend” and they broke up. She had no money, nowhere to go, nobody to turn to and I felt that helping her was the right thing to do. 

She told me she had a full time job and couldn’t pay 50% upfront, but after her 90 days she’d get a raise and could. Two months at most. So I agreed to pay 60% of the rent until she was on her feet. 

I changed my living situation, I supplied the communal stuff like soap, toilet paper, let her pay what she could when she could for utilities. This increased my living expenses.

So when she stopped showing up to her job (depression) and they threatened to fire her, her response to me was “I don’t need this job anyway” and I began to worry.

She quit that job. Took a part time. Now she COULDN’T pay half. She hopped a few part time jobs and when one finally hired her full time, she quit within two weeks.

She’s gone through 4-5 jobs in 10 months. Fired from one but all the rest, she made the choice to quit. 

I had to maintain my full time job, and work 1-2 side jobs and quit school because of the financial strain and the worry, and always she had a reason. She hated the job, she was tired, it was dead-end etc.


My partner had to move in to offset the costs - we told her she could stay through end of lease if she could afford it but if she found a more affordable spot before then she should take it. I felt the 7 month window was BEYOND generous.

Over time, she’d help herself to small things that weren’t hers - our desserts, my coffee, sometimes my fully cooked meal preps and when confronted usually just cried and once told me she are my meal prep because she “just couldn’t”.

At some point my compassion turned to confusion, my empathy dissolved. I’ve become bitter, resentful, small things became big. She’s non confrontational but passive aggressive so any time I brought up an issue - like her allowing her chinchilla to free roam and not picking up its feces after. Leaving chinchilla poop to accumulate in spaces like the kitchen and bathroom. Always some excuse. Retaliations on her end were things like serving a bottle of tequila I brought back from Mexico to friends and claiming it “fell” off the fridge. 

We started avoiding her half of the house entirely - trying to white knuckle it til the end of lease. And then I got news I was losing my job.

The stress has been enormous, and the breaking point of my by now brittle relationship with my roommate, tense at the best of times, snapped when she passive aggressively boxed up a 1,000 piece puzzle I’d been working on in an attempt to relieve stress. I left to work a gig and came home and it was boxed up. So I confronted her and asked her not to do it again.

And she lit into us about how we make her feel unsafe in the home because of how I talked to her (we were both snippy in the conversation around the puzzle but I felt it was a dick move on her part and I didn’t yell, call names, etc. I sternly asked her not to box up my stuff again because I’m stressed and this is what I’m doing to manage it.

All hell has since broke lose in the house chat. We were accused of menial shit in common spaces that largely she’s been the culprit of. Leaving messes etc - dumb small shit. I knew she’d passive aggressively retaliate - and she did.

She got a big tattoo and left the bloody, used, and now waterlogged bandage in the bathtub. Shit like that I just expect now. And when I texted her about it she said she “had a fever dream she threw it out”. Those are equally normal excuses for stuff like this.

So I said let’s talk breaking lease - she doesn’t feel safe, we’re deeply unhappy, I feel I’ve been taken advantage of etc so let’s just break lease. She offered to stay til end of lease and pay the remainder so we said yes. 

The next morning she rescinded and said her student loan just paid fall tuition and now she will “only have 2.5k until January 31”

She just got a huge tattoo. Has another on the books. So I pointed out in the group chat, we assumed since she has funds to get tattoos that she still had a part time job. And due to the large disproportionate amount of money I’ve spent on this living arrangement we’d like her to pay her fair third of the lease break. Which she replied “but we’ve always split bills equally”  which is when I went full asshole. 

I sent ledger receipts of the 5 months and over 4k difference in rent between us as proof - she can’t dispute the landlord’s records. 

I told her we are terminating our lease. 


She’s fucked financially - but I don’t care. I tried to help her and I feel like all I did was become a partial maid and mom to a fully formed adult woman and I’m somehow now the villain. 

The passive aggressive behavior, the financial stress, the genuinely gross habits. I’m so far beyond fed up and she’s right to call me an asshole and aggressive - I’m being both right now. 

But no, I don’t feel bad. I’m angry, I’m seething - if it weren’t the puzzle I would’ve snapped over something else.  We’re fighting over petty shit - she doesn’t want me using her cast iron, fine. She can give up my contributions to the communal space, which include: the couch, tv, internet, table, chairs, microwave, cutlery, pots and pans, all cleaning and laundry supplies, the tv subscriptions, etc etc.

I’m so fucking tired and furious. So so so tired. ",3,1728852635.0,offmychest,3,0.8,False

So I'm 20 kg overweight (which may sound like not a big deal, but I get really, really dismorphyc about it) and no matter how much I try, I cannot lose it.

I tried to maintain calorie deficit and track calories at least 3 times this autumn, but about 3-4 days in I lose to compulsive thoughts and hunger, overeat a lot, become very sad about it and give it up. I cannot stand the hunger at all.

I have a really high appetite, eat much more than my family members (otherwise I feel hungry and anyway overeat), also I have OCD and ADHD so I'm very familiar with compulsive thoughts and lack of impulse control. I also have crippling addiction to caffeine, drink coffee up to 5 times per day + energy drinks almost every day.

Only things that worked for me so far are 1) drink coffee with sweeteners instead of sugar and 2) avoid grocery stores at all.

I'm very depressed about it at this point, I feel like some heroin addict, but my heroin is food and caffeine, I have no idea how to overcome this vicious circle of undereating and then overeating. At this point I guess I will soon just do amphetamines to not feel hungry.

Is there some other drugs that kills one's appetite? Btw I use estrogen for transition and will probably start SSRIs for psychiatric diagnoses soon, if that matters.",0,1728852516.0,loseit,4,0.33,False

It all started yesterday when we went dirt biking in the mountains.  We like to get out at least once a month and it’s getting late in the fall now.  Pretty soon we’ll be switching over to snowmobiles.  We had a group of 6.  My husband Ian, his longtime friend Leah (30F), her man Rob (32M), my friend and client Kerri (27F) and her husband Will (27M).  Ian and Leah would be considered expert riders.  They both grew up near the mountains and have biked, hiked, ran, skied and snowmobiled them all their lives.  I’ve been riding for the past three years since I started dating Ian.  We’ve been married just over a year now.  Rob, Kerri and Will have all just started this past summer.  All three of them are athletic and brave enough to enjoy riding but I do find myself split between the two groups often.

Yesterday I’d decided to keep up with the thrill seekers and leave the newbs behind.  I was so proud of myself when I did it.  I’ve learned to control my bike.  When to hit the gas and when to lay off.  How to recognize a good line to take versus a dangerous one.  How to avoid shale and stand or lean when necessary.  I truly held my own and both Ian and Leah were very impressed.  I even was able to help Leah get dusted off and back up out of a rock gorge that she failed to avoid.  I could see the surprise in her eyes when I pulled her up.  I don’t think she ever realized how strong I am.

I was a swimmer in college.  I even tried out for our country’s Olympic team and finished sixth.  Just a bit outside of being asked to continue training with them as an alternate.  I’ve always been very fit and I take pride in how strong I am for my size.

I’m all woman though.  All of my gear and my bike are pink.  I bought them when we started, and I’ve always loved my choice.  Leah didn’t though.  She would always tease me about being too girly for the mountains and would get downright mad if my bike had issues.  Calling it a “Pink piece of shit.”.  It wasn’t yesterday though; I held my own and she knew it.

We always gather at someone’s house when we’re done the day and after we drop our equipment off.  Last night we were at Leah and Rob’s.  They have a small house but a big firepit in their backyard.  It’s probably the last night of the year for that as well.  We did our usual talk about the day, sharing war stories and showing off bruises.  Will had a good fall that will leave quite the bruise on his hip.  I got to brag about pulling Leah up and helping her get her bike out of the gorge.  Leah got pretty messed up and was trying to brag about climbs she had done in the past that I couldn’t do at the time.  No-one gave her much airtime though.  She was starting to get emotional the more inebriated she got, sitting in her lawn chair, staring at me and crying a bit.  It was weird behavior for her.  We shut it down around midnight and Rob had to guide Leah into the house because she was struggling to keep her balance.

I say all of the above to give what I view as the context for the text Leah sent at 3am that I read this morning.  It said:

***I’m so sorry what we’ve been doing Amanda, I hope someday you can forgive me.***

I think it’s obvious how I’m interpreting this text but there is a small hope that it could be just referring to her disdain of my riding ability up to now.

I’m looking for some thoughts on how to proceed and I’ll answer questions in an update.

It started as a small experiment. I’d been feeling stuck in the routine of work and life and thought maybe this whole “gratitude thing” would help. I didn’t expect much, but I kept a notebook on my nightstand and every morning after waking up, I’d jot down 3 things I was thankful for.

At first, it was tough. Some days, I could barely think of anything beyond “I’m grateful for coffee” (which I still am, by the way). But after a few weeks, I noticed a shift. Suddenly, little things stood out—like the way my dog wags his tail when I come home or the fact that the sun sets in this stunning orange right outside my window.

It’s become a routine that I look forward to. Even on bad days, it helps me focus on what’s good, even if it’s just something small. It only takes a minute, but it’s completely changed my mindset.

as sort of a goof, i prompted chat GPT to create an aeropress recipe for medium roast brazil coffee (that's all i drink) and it gave me:

  
1:16 ratio, 16g coffee 256 195 degree F water 

grind on 18 (i prompted for settings on baratza encore esp) - this is finer that i typically do, this is into espresso range. 

  
upright, pour 45g water and let it bloom for 30 seconds. add the rest of the water and stir 5 seconds. add plunger and let it sit for one full minute, press out slowly. 

  
the resulting brew was really ,really good. it was still slightly bitter. I asked chat CPT what to do about the bitterness and it gave the obvious suggestions - grind more coarse, shorter immersion time, and lower brewing temp.

I tried all three and found brewing at 182-185 degrees nailed it. full, rich flavor, zero unpleasant notes. the rest of this recipe is unchanged. 

  
the process was interesting that it created a recipe that took very little tweaking to maximize for exactly what i wanted.

I started watching our Tim when he was doing his ""Is this the worst hotel/caravan park in Britain?"" kind of videos and I loved them and his commentary, because while he was critical, it was from a place of some appreciation and nostalgia for those experiences and perhaps disappointment that some of those places are deteriorating. A lot of the time I felt like the takeaway was ""yeah it's not so fancy, but it's not a bad place to spend a weekend with your family on a budget""

As he's evolved and started making more of these ""luxury"" travel videos, I was annoyed at first (and still get annoyed most of the time) at how his content shifted to being about generally less attainable things. I however think there's some valuable meta-commentary across all of these videos - Tim is a simple guy who does not have the mindset of a wealthy person who would usually book something like a first class international flight or a penthouse hotel suite. So while his commentary is often times bizarrely placed, it does work to at least give a guy like me (a similarly simple man) a reality check about 1. How expensive things are, and 2. What you actually get out of that thing you pay that astronomical amount for

Especially for the really expensive flights he's been doing videos on, it is genuinely astounding how little material value you get. The British Airways business class flight was 3,300 pounds. That is shockingly high to me and for what? Some extra leg room on the plane and access to a ""lounge"" that's still full of people and from what I can tell, not much different than the rest of the airport. There is no way I can be convinced that it's worth that price for a person like me. I would feel ripped off and like I'm out of place. But that's the point - these expensive plane tickets and hotels are able to charge that premium because the real value is that you don't have to be around ""the poors"", or at least minimize your interaction with that class of people. I'm sure yes, if you are a business person who needs to be on their laptop all the time, fine, your lounge access and plane desk space might be worth it. But I'm not that and I'm not at all uncomfortable around your typical economy class travelers. These videos of his realign my perspective so that I feel a lot more content about my place in life and it reminds me that sometimes these aspirational ideas like first class seats and hotel suites provide very little additional value to a me. Yes I'm annoyed that he's moaning  about dust on a coffee table in a $1,500 hotel room, but then I realize that the $1,500 room is functionally not much different than the $200 room at the Holiday Inn Express

# AI MasterSuite Money-Back Policy

Now, I know what you're thinking. ""This sounds too good to be true. What if it doesn't work for me?"" Well, hold onto your hats, because AI MasterSuite has got you covered with a rock-solid money-back guarantee.

Here's the deal: You get a full 30 days to put AI MasterSuite through its paces. If for any reason you're not completely blown away by the results, just shoot them an email, and they'll refund every penny. No questions asked, no hoops to jump through.

This isn't some wishy-washy ""satisfaction guarantee"" either. It's a real, no-nonsense, ""we stand behind our product"" kind of deal. They're so confident you'll love AI MasterSuite that they're willing to take all the risk.

Now, I don't know about you, but I've spent more on a single dinner than what they're asking for this entire suite of tools. And remember, this is a one-time fee. No monthly subscriptions, no hidden charges, no upsells required to make it work.

I would love to become a naturopathic doctor and educate and build a space for all individuals in the community to work on various types of health together. 

I know I don’t necessarily need to be a doctor to facility the space but at the same time, since I was a little girl I wanted to help those who struggled like this. I’ve witnessed my own mother lay in bed my whole life because of Lupus. I stumbled upon alternative healing from the books she had in the basement. Nothing would feel more rewarding than helping someone like my mother be able to live her life again.

The path to becoming a doctor is rigorous, and currently I’m not in the best financial situation to make it happen. Especially because in the next few years I imagine having children in the mix and I would want to be able to be a support presently for them as well. 

Here’s the crossroads,

Option 1.

I could get a job immediately at Starbucks, and work towards getting an online degree in Integrative Health which is a tract that could lead directly to medical school. Then after apply to different schools that offer integrative medicine and holistic health.

The challenge in this ^ direct route is, 
1. My income will be significantly low for the next few years.
2. I desire to have children in the next few years and I want to be better financially prepared for them, along with emotionally and professionally. 
3. I won’t outrightly have the opportunity to make the amount of money I feel needed to feel secure in building the future I want. 

The upsides of doing this directly,
1. Starbucks pays for the bachelors degree so it would be free.
2. I would get it done sooner so then I could start my path in the profession sooner.


Option 2

Go to school for two years and pursue the same type of education my partner did. It is another trade skill that I could take anywhere and genuinely is in high demand. We could travel and take up contracts that pay up to 40k for 13 weeks of work. The program is rigorous and not many get through it. ( but if I think I want to become a doctor and achieve that level of dedication, 2 years would seemingly be a great stepping stone.)

The challenge with this route is, 
1. I’m unsure of I would enjoy this career.
2. It would put a delay in the goal I have for studying integrative medicine but it could be seen as a stepping stone.
3. I’m afraid of committing to the program because I’m not fully sure yet if it’s what I would want. 

The pluses,
1. I have the opportunity to be connected with professionals in the program already because my partner does it.
2. It would enable me to create more financial and job stability which doing something less physically strenuous.
3. There is a way I could get this program completely paid for if I work part time for a place in my community, which is pretty amazing.
3. It allows my to work with patients directly and helps me understand the deeper levels of what’s involved working in the medical field.

Option 3.

Stick with painting, waitress more and make it work in a way that I hired out more work. I could build my painting business into a company that had larger margins that I could invest into creating a community center. 

I could learn and lean into my entrepreneurial and innovative side to see what I’m made of. My mentor and I have done some huge projects lately, we’re both creative and innovative with wanting to create a space in the community. We have the capacity to hire and train and run a successful business. Which the hopefully eventually, I’ll just be able to hire the with people and make the community space together effectively. 

The challenges of this route is, 

1. There’s a lot more risk and overall I haven’t put myself out there to this level yet.
2. It feels like it would be just doing more of it but it might not give me the freedom I’m seeking.
3. I feel like I’ve spent my twenties rucking it without a plan and I feel this would be doing the same thing. 
4. Still having job instability and what I’m accustomed to.

The plus side:

1. I could continue building upon my passion skills, i function exceptionally well in a project to project bases and this energizes me.
2. I don’t have to invest money , I could just profit off the skills I have build already and continue on that. 
3. Maybe it would work and we could get things off the ground.

Overall:
I have a dream to make a vision happen but I’m unsure if I’m just afraid, lazy or both. Sometimes I don’t feel qualified but at the same time, I look at other successful people who have built something of impact and they didn’t allow the lack of funding to stop them. 

I’m unsure if I’m seeking knowledge at this time, funding or courage. 

I’ve thought a lot about starting with option 2 then doing option 1, so both schooling could be paid for. I would have a good job that I could even just do part time, get free coffee for a few years as well while pursuing integrative medicine. 

I’m not sure if I’m afraid of being locked into something because I’ve been freelancing for most of my adult life and routine isn’t something I’ve thrived in. I feel I haven’t work d as hard as I can to build my future and pursuing this would require that of me. 

I’m not as proud of the life I’ve built for myself even though I am proud of the woman I’ve been crafted into. I just want more for myself and I don’t want to sell myself short. I’m still trying to navigate my options and I would love to hear what you all have to share. Your insight and experience is welcome here 🫶. Also, if you see undertones, please share: I’m happy to have a deeper understanding from other perspectives. Thank you!

1g2yzqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1g2yzqp/review_woodstock_inn_and_white_barn_inn_for_new/,Review: Woodstock Inn and White Barn Inn for New England Fall getaway,"My husband and 2 kids (ages 3 and 1) are on the way home from our Fall foliage trip and thought I’d write up a review for the 2 hotels we stayed at. I’d previously posted here looking for recommendations and with the help of this sub and Alex we ending up booking 2 nights - with kids - at Woodstock Inn in Woodstock, VT and 2 nights - without kids - at White Barn Inn in Kennebunkport, ME. We booked with Alex and as most here already know - we highly recommend! I’d never used a travel agent but she made things so easy and we definitely received perks at WBI through her booking. 

Woodstock Inn

We wanted a family-friendly place that would give us all the Gilmore Girls Fall vibes and wow, this place fit the bill to a T. The property is beautiful and idyllic - landscaping is pristine with both large front and back grassy lawns that are perfect to run around with kids, have a picnic, etc. the interior of the hotel is also very charming. It’s beautifully decorated to fit the vibe and there are so many cozy spots to relax around the hotel. Our favorite activities at the hotel were s’mores at night by the bonfire and hanging out in the awesome game room after dinner. I’m not sure if this hotel is chubby per se, but with its popularity in the fall it was chubby prices. I can’t say I noticed much about the service - other than I messed up a dinner reservation and they did work to accommodate us despite being full. The room was cozy and had a great shower. Overall, I could see this being a repeat / family tradition vacation for us in the future. 

White Barn Inn

My husband and I stayed 2 nights at White Barn Inn with no kids and were looking for a luxury hotel where we could eat good food and do nothing without feeling like we were missing out on anything (aka the hotel is the experience). This hotel is quaint and small and old, but beautifully decorated inside. We stayed in a Junior suite in the barn itself. As soon as we checked in we noticed how friendly and down to earth all the staff were. Very competent and nice but no stuffy vibes whatsoever. We got a welcome cocktail upon checking (spiked apple cider) and had welcome treats (from Alex and hotel) waiting in our room. Our first day there was rainy and the hotel had Barbour boots and coats for us to use which was a nice touch. 

We ate at the White Barn Inn for dinner the first night and somehow got the best seat in the restaurant! We were at the table right in front of the iconic picturesque barn window. The restaurant service was again so competent and down to earth. We did the 8 course tasting menu and were truthfully blown away by the food. I’d read mixed things on other subreddits but we are pretty big foodies and both were raving about the dinner. In comparison we had dinner the second night at Earth at Hidden Pond (which overwhelmingly has good reviews) and were so disappointed. I rarely have a total miss of a dinner reservation bc I pride myself on such thorough research but this meal was frankly mediocre at best. Cocktails were good. 

Each morning the hotel had our specific tea / coffee orders waiting outside our bedroom door. We also used the bikes in property to explore the town. My only slight negative is that I forgot a hairbrush and I guess they didn’t have any kind of hairbrush or comb on property for me, but that’s my only very minor gripe! The staff and service were wonderful and the hotel was quaint and charming! Happy to answer any questions about our trip. ",15,1728851239.0,chubbytravel,2,1.0,False

I'm a screenwriter from France living in Manitoba for the past three years now. Switching from my native Alps to the Canadian prairies has been a bit of a shock at first, but I've learned to love it here and it became ""home"" quicker than I thought. I've been lucky enough to explore North to South, camp East to West, get frostbite in the process, and even work on a bison ranch, which inspired the novel I'm working on at the moment called *Dry Bread ain't Greasy*. 

Even though we have lots of filming happening in the Province, it's pretty rare to find a book or a film that is truly set in Manitoba, which is why I'd love to share this with you today. 

[Here's the first chapter.](https://drybread.substack.com/p/i-bunny-ears-bunny-ears)

This novel functions as a serialized book, with new chapters being released every week. They're usually pretty short, meant to be a coffee break companion, a breakfast buddy, or a post-Thanksgiving dinner digestif.

>*Tension escalates between four ex-convicts inside a women-only reintegration program with wild horses in the Canadian prairies. The intellectual disability of the younger one threatens the participants' chance at a steady future that they would secure if they complete the program's last task: crossing the country on horseback. Early on their journey, this dysfunctional quartet will be forced to work together when they're framed for a murder they didn't commit and set their mind on finding the real felons before they're sent back to prison.*

I hope this will resonate with some of you, and I'd love to connect with people who have been living in the Province longer than me, ideally in the rural. I'm sure you have tons of anecdotes, stories, or simply a vision and appreciation of Manitoba that I'd love to hear about.

Wishing everyone a fantastic Thanksgiving, and a special thought for those who spend it on their own.

1g2ywny,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g2ywny/aita_for_ghosting_my_best_friend/,AITA for ghosting my best friend?,"So, it’s been a while since this all happened, but it’s been on my mind this past week. I ghosted my ‘best friend’ after seven years of friendship.

I (26F) ghosted my best friend (25F) earlier this year. I had been thinking about ending the friendship for a while, but honestly, I didn’t know how to go about it. I’m not good at confrontation, and whenever I tried to talk about things that bothered me, they were either flipped back on me or nothing would change.

There were a few reasons that led to me ghosting her, It’s quite a long story, my apologies and I am going to give some context and then some further details on the things towards the end of the friendship.

I became friends with, Emily, when we were 18/19 years old through a mutual. Soon after we became friends, she fell out with our mutual because they got into a relationship. Emily felt left out as they spent less time with her and did more one-on-one things with their girlfriend. She ended up calling them selfish, which pretty much ended their friendship. We remained friends.

Throughout our friendship, I always worked while she didn’t. She had on-and-off job, which meant that sometimes she couldn’t afford to do things, so I either had to pay/lend money for her or she couldn’t come. When she couldn’t, I would receive a message about leaving her out, which made me feel guilty tbh, she would tell me she had no money, and when I did things with other friends, she would accuse me of making more effort with them than with her. In reality, I simply couldn’t afford to pay for both of us all the time. I was okay with this, I had offered to pay for her these were the terms and I did it as I knew she couldn’t afford it and often I wouldn’t even ask for her to pay me back as I knew times were tough and she couldn’t afford it. But it was annoying to have it thrown in my face when I did things without her too, even with separate friends.

She also constantly asked me for lifts. I drove, she didn’t, and she very rarely gave me fuel money, in the first 5 years of our friendship I can’t recall one occasion she gave me fuel money. Once, she rang me to ask if I could take her to a job interview. I was busy and she got angry because she didn’t have time to walk there and was going to be late! But she never asked me for the lift in advance either.

At first, I didn’t mind much because, despite what my other friends and family were telling me—that I was being taken advantage of—I liked her company and defended her, saying she was just going through a tough time, which she was.

When I was 21, I lost my sister. On the morning she passed away, I paid for an Uber for Emily to come over and be with me, and she did, along with another close friend of mine. My close friend was supposed to go on a first date that day but cancelled to come over but he said he would need to leave by 10 p.m. to make it up to his date by bringing her takeout. I appreciated that he went out of his way to be there for me anyway. However, Emily got into an argument with him, calling him selfish and a bad friend. This annoyed me, as it wasn’t her place to say anything. I let it slide.
The day of the funeral, Emily didn’t have money for transport, so I arranged for my friend to pick her up as I was going to be in the car with my family and we needed to meet at the church . She argued with me, saying it was unfair of me to ask my friend to give her a lift because it would make her uncomfortable. This is when I found out about her previous argument with my friend (which my other friend hadn’t mentioned but still agreed to give her the lift!). She ended up taking the lift, but it bothered me she was arguing with me about trying to sort her a lift out a week after my sister died and I was not emotionally okay and I didn’t even know they argued because no one told me. But I forgave her.

Emily got a boyfriend, let’s call him Dave. Dave was a nightmare. He got her kicked out of her house, leaving her homeless. I let her stay at my house, drove them to emergency housing, and helped them move. Emily didn’t have any other friends—I had introduced her to my friendship circle, but none of them got along with her and felt she treated me like a ‘mug.’ Emily and Dave are now both asking me for lifts, money, and favours, still with barely offering anything in return.

During this time, Emily would often take her frustrations with Dave out on me. They would send me constant messages accusing me of things like stealing from them, talking behind their backs, or being sly—none of which were true. Dave would use me as a weapon in their relationship. After some time, Emily realised that Dave was the one lying, not just about that but about a lot of things and it just was a really toxic relationship, really tough, they broke up. Although I was still angry about being falsely accused, I understood the situation and forgave her. After they broke up she was now in a bad place with little friends and relied on me to hang out with her a few evenings a week. She also got a full time job, earning more than I did (this is relevant), but still asked me for lifts. When I said I was busy, she would become upset and question what I was doing and when I’d be free, often asking if I could cancel my plans to help her.

They smoked a lot of weed, and if they ran out, she would repeatedly ring and text me for a lift to pick up more. Once, I was on a date two hours away in Liverpool, and she rang me eight times asking when I was coming back so she could pick up. She continued to message me the entire drive back, which annoyed me because it felt like she expected me to drop everything for her. This wasn’t a one-off; it happened weekly. Throughout our friendship, anyone I dated would eventually get fed up with her because of the way she inserted herself into my relationships, often expecting me to drop everything to help her.

Since she had started her new job, she would get paid weekly and wanted me to take her food shopping every Friday. I didn’t mind but asked her to contribute fuel money, to which she said no. I asked for £10 a month, which she refused, saying it was unfair for her to pay because the shop was ‘two minutes down the road’—even though she lived 25 minutes from my house. She lived around a 25 minute drive from my house, then 11 minutes to the shop, and then another 25 minutes for me to get home. It would cost me more than £10 a month for me to take her food shopping every Friday. She still continued to ask me for lifts after saying no to giving me fuel money. This is around the time period where I was really getting fed up.

I felt Emily only spoke to me when she needed a favour, and when I pointed this out, she started messaging me to ask how I was, only to follow up by asking for a lift. I told her to stop asking for same-day favours and then getting upset when I was busy, but nothing changed.

A few months before I ghosted her, a friend passed away, and a memorial was planned on the same day we were supposed to attend a concert together. I asked if we could reschedule, as I wanted to attend the memorial, but she called me selfish and complained that her plans always get ruined, which wasn’t true. I ended up buying new concert tickets for a different date, but her lack of empathy bothered me. She also knew this friend and claimed to be really upset about the whole situation but then reacted like that? 

Once on the anniversary of my sister’s death, I took the day off work because I was feeling really low. Emily texted to ask what I was doing that evening, and I said I wasn’t doing anything because I was sad. She replied with ‘aw,’ which annoyed me because whenever she was upset, she expected me to listen to her, but when I opened up, all I got was ‘aw’ or ‘that sucks.’ She later asked if I wanted to get coffee, and I was pleasantly surprised, thinking she was trying to be there for me. However, we didn’t get coffee—I think she just wanted me to pick up the guy she was seeing. What bothered me most was that this guy, who I’d only met once, said more about my sister’s death than Emily did. It really upset me that she had clearly told him about my sister but hadn’t been able to express anything to me. It really annoyed me because why can she speak about it to random people about it but not me? Did she tell him she was hanging out with me to be there for me because not one moment of that interaction was her being there for me. I let it slide, thinking it was an emotional day.

The final straw came after we spoke about how I felt like she was only asking me for favours again, she said she felt like I never asked her to do things either, I do admit I did stop asking her to see if she asked me for anything other than favours and well that’s all I got, so we planned to go roller-skating. On the day, she said she had no money, so I suggested rescheduling for a day when I could bring food to her house, and we could cook dinner together. The day came, and she cancelled because a guy from Tinder was coming over. She later messaged me asking if I was free that evening, but I couldn’t, as I was spending time with my little brother as something had came up and I needed to see him that evening. The last few months I got better at putting in boundaries and saying no to unexpected plans as I was feeling overwhelmed and my therapist said I should do this to manage myself better and she had an issue with that I think. Note I did not tell her my therapist told me to do that as I did not want her to think I was saying she was overwhelming me, which she was, but I didn’t want to upset her to I did not tell her that I was enforcing boundaries more for me. Anyway,  I replied saying that isn’t the case I had plans with her the day prior and she cancelled and I am saying I am free on Friday to reschedule, When I explained this, she argued that I should have given her a new date to reschedule the roller-skating when she cancelled, instead of just saying ‘it’s okay, we can reschedule.’ She complained that I was doing more with other people, but in reality, I saw her more than anyone else except my partner. She said it annoying seeing me do things with other people at not her but the only difference here is I stopped paying for her to do things as she now earns more money than me and I have a car to run too and I can’t afford to pay for us both anymore.

She also criticised me for not including my partner in our plans, though she had never asked to spend time with both of us. My partner didn’t want to come along because they didn’t enjoy sitting in the car for hours while I drove Emily around, which I thought was fair enough.

After I told her that I had prioritised our plans for the previous day but was free again on Friday, she replied calling me a ‘piss-poor friend’ and accusing me of being selfish. I didn’t reply.
A few days later, she messaged me again, saying, ‘When I tell you that you’re a bad friend, your response is to ignore me. If it’s that easy to lose me from your life, then fair enough.’ I once again do not reply.

A couple of weeks go by, and now my brother is living with me. I have a family plan on Apple for Apple Music and other services, but Emily is still on my family plan, which means there isn’t space for my brother. So, I remove her.

She texts me again.

She says ‘all I’ve done is complain that you haven’t been a good friend, and that you haven’t made time for me.’ She tells me I need to take a good look in the mirror, calls me materialistic, and says that I’ve finally shown my true colours, adding that I need to grow up.

Once again, I did not reply. I felt like it was rich to call me materastlic when she was arguing with me about removing her from my apple plan. I proceed to remove her from my Disney+ and Netflix subscriptions too as I felt like I should not be paying for someone who speaks to me like that.

I don’t regret ending the friendship, but I do feel bad about ghosting her, especially after such a long time. Part of me wonders if I was wrong for not explaining myself or giving her a proper goodbye.

I feel like I was a good friend to her, I did more for her than I have any of my other friends and it bums me out that it ended the way that it did as I put a lot of time and effort into our friendship and I just felt like she didn't see that I really tried. It hurts me she thinks I did all those things and that I put more time into other friends. Like it really sucks for me I tried so hard to be a good friend to her and she thinks I was really bad? She said multiple times how everyone leaves her and she doesn’t understand why, and I did the exact same thing like I knew she felt the way she did. She already had really low self esteem and questioned why people didn’t stick around - should I have told her my reasons for leaving?

Also I am not saying she wasn't a good friend at times, as she was and this does miss out a lot of details as it was a 7 year friendship but I just couldn't deal with feeling like I was someone's doormat or personal taxi any longer. They was also times I wasn’t a perfect friend either, I don’t want anyone to think that I am but I never once intentionally did or said anything to disrespect her.

1g2yw5y,https://i.redd.it/0xcmdd6k1lud1.jpeg,My prediction on the structure of seasons 2!! ,"So today’s episode was fantastic and I’m happy to see that we’re gonna experience peak again, I think I have a rough idea where this is gonna go. And it confirms my theory that we’re still going to get the ggc arc in this season in a way. 

One reason being the opening. Once again, the opening slaps, but besides that they’ve been showing a lot of what’s going to happen. From the Golden scorpion conflict, the mech fighter, Sun fight with the trash pile, phygers black armor, sunrakus new weapons AND his robot helmet, in addition to lycagon. Seems like that’s what we’re building towards.


And Reason 2: event structure. 
When discussing with people on whether or not we can fit the entire lycagon saga into 13 or so episodes, they always said that it’s way much more chapters then the first season had. And right about that, but there’s one thing they feel like people seems to be forgetting. That being the event themselves. For the individual events in SLF, structured ways that make for one off adventures. And This allows them to make, a lot of chapters fit into one episodes. Reminder that they were able to fit chapters 49-54 in one episode.(Episode 23.) and a lot of the events coming up, the Mech fighter, them finding the power key, the fight against the Golden scorpion, and stuff like the fight against the trash monster, or all events that you could do in one or two episodes, and still have a few natural and not rushed. Which leaves us for a sick boss fight midseason finale against lycagon, which if I were to compare it to the weatherman fight, would maybe take three to four episodes. 

So with that in mind, let me map out my predictions for how the season would be structured. 



Ep:1(59-60) covering the bomb robots. (Todays ep)

Ep:2(61-63) covering the group initial fight for the power core, as well as the lead in for the big guild conversation. 

Ep:3(63-66) covering the majority of the guilds conversation, as well as a small bit into suns scorpion attempt after the silent update) (maybe stopping the ep once sun rage quits)

Ep:4(66-70) finishing the scorpion conflict as well as the fight the gold one. (maybe you can extend it to make the golden scorpion its own ep, but still!) 

Ep:5:(71-72) covering sun trying to better understand the armory he has, in addition to nefilim hollow’s introduction. 

Ep:6:(73-76)Sun vs rust.  A fight that would take the whole episode. Ending with rust info on cryinid. 

Ep:7:(77-78) an info-based episode, setting up crynid, and leading into sun and Rays initial team up. 

Ep:8:(79-81)suns speedrun with the trash monster, and sun and reis interaction. ending up with a glimpse of chapter 82, but end whould End with chapter 82 with the whole pencil “betrayer” bit. 

Ep:9:(82-85)Sun and rei seeing the animal guild and lycagon. The guild gets wrecked. Sun and rei have a peek moment, and we end of the episode with the beginning of the fight. 

Ep:10-13 can probably go either way structure wise, but me personally I would go with. 

Ep:10:86-89(the initial fight with lycagon, and the introduction of the Redbird mech, but would it end in the middle of 89 when akane shows up. 

Ep:11:89-91 an introduction to akane, as well as some more fighting bits.

Ep:12:92-93: the super climactic finishing battle with both the giga drill and Armageddon finally being unleash, with them partially defeating lycagon and ending on the fact Suns curse might be disappearing. 

Ep:13:94-96: information about the aftermath of the battle, as well as them continuing on their quest and getting the card, with the episode in the first core ending with rust and Mordo showing up, katso emailing the guys, and a small glimpse of cryinid.  


 

And that’s how I predict the first course is gonna be! As you can see, you could pase really well in 13 episodes. Which leaves us pretty of room for ggc. 

But you may be asking, “but that is pretty long too! It’s around 70 chapters! How could you fit that much into the rest of the season?!?”

I’m glad you asked person reading this! I thought of that too and it’s actually a lot easier than we think with the idea I have. So Let’s break down and predict the rest of the season! 




Ep:13.5: we’d probably have a recap episode so let’s just put it here!

Ep:14:(97-98): covering katso and pencils individual chapters. It might be nice for them.

Ep:15:99-100: the start of the cryinad quest.

Ep:16:101-104:  this would cover the ship battle and would end halfway through 104 when they go under. 

Ep:17:104-107: this would kind of cover the Lore of the underwater city, as well as the initial start fight from that area. 

Ep:18: 108-110: Cover the fight with the giant sea serpent, as well as the leading to into ggc with the tease of Sophie! Maybe leading a little bit into chapter 111

Ep19: 111-113: the intro of the new team, as well as an introduction to Galactica as a teasing bit at the end. 

Ep:20: 114-118: suns fight in Galactica, the swearing match against katso, in addition to learning his past with Sophie, in addition to the coffee shop bit, leading him into going back into Slf. 

Ep 21 and 22: 119-122: covering the fight with the giant whale, realistically this could be one episode, but you would have to be too for how I want this to go. 

Ep 23: 123-124: covering more aftermath from the whale fight, as well as the realization that katso can’t join in like planned. 

Ep 24:125-126: the final episode: them discussing the plan of how they can get katso in on time, as well as the initial start of the ceremony. The season would then end with the opening ceremony, and the announcers declaring the start of the tournament. 



Now You may be looking at this and saying , “ looks cool, but you didn’t really fit the arc into 13 episodes like you said.” Now that’s true. But remember, when I said we could get ggc in this season, I say we can get the WHOLE thing in there.   

As much as I really wanted to see ggc animated, I underestimated how much we had to go through in order to get there initially. However, I got the , and I feel like this would be a perfect place to end off the season. We already got introduced to this new game with his new mechanics, and we’re ready to see more from it, only to end the season on when it’s just getting started. and that would then leave next season to cover the rest of the ark in the first half, and cryinad in the second half. This way, it would leave for a pretty awesome jampacked season for season three, but also would give the manga time to catch up. Because by the time that season 2s first half is done, not only whould cryinad hypothetically be finished, but also the staff would probably start working on the rest of the ggc arc. So yeah that was my prediction on how the season would be structured! Regardless on how it actually is, I can’t wait for more of this PEAK show!!! ",8,1728850972.0,ShangriLaFrontier,2,1.0,False

I’m planning to relocate to your city and would love some input on which neighborhood to consider.

A little about me: I’m 28, single, and will be working in an office. I’ve lived in a major city my whole life and am looking for a change. I enjoy working out, live music, reading, cooking, hiking, and being in nature.

I’m looking for either an apartment or a house and am open to having roommates. I’ve seen that rent seems to be around the $800 range—is that accurate? I can pay more if needed, but I’d like to get a sense of the typical rent.

I’m unsure about living near parks or lakes, but I wouldn’t mind being in an active or lively area with access to nightlife, dining, and coffee shops (semi-important). Since Madison isn’t a huge city, I don’t imagine my commute will be long, as my office will be in the city.

Schools and proximity to public transportation aren’t priorities, but I may have some interest in public transport.

What Is Puravive?  
Puravive is a natural weight loss supplement comprising eight tropical nutrients and plants. It targets the low levels of brown adipose tissue found in overweight individuals. The blend of these natural ingredients aims to optimize BAT levels, facilitating healthy weight loss.

Each bottle contains 30 capsules, manufactured in an FDA-registered and GMP-certified facility in the US. The supplement is non-GMO, non-addictive, and free from stimulants.

Puravive Ingredients  
Each of the eight ingredients in Puravive has been chosen for its ability to boost BAT levels and provide additional health benefits:

Luteolin: Enhances brain health and maintains healthy cholesterol.  
Kudzu: Rich in antioxidants, supports cardiovascular functions, and boosts BAT formation.  
Holy Basil: Improves brain function and reduces stress.  
White Korean Ginseng: Promotes the browning of fat, boosts immunity, and reduces oxidative stress.  
Amur Cork Bark: Aids digestion, reduces bloating, and increases BAT production.  
Propolis: Induces thermogenesis in brown fat and supports healthy blood sugar levels.  
Quercetin: Activates BAT and rejuvenates aging cells.  
Oleuropein: Increases BAT activity and promotes healthy cholesterol levels.  
How Does Puravive Promote Weight Loss?  
Puravive addresses the root cause of weight gain: low brown adipose tissue levels. Brown fat, unlike white fat, burns calories to regulate body temperature. It is rich in mitochondria, which convert calories into energy. Higher BAT levels result in more fat burning, and even a small increase in BAT can significantly enhance calorie burning.

Propolis: Induces thermogenesis in brown fat and supports healthy blood sugar levels.  
Quercetin: Activates BAT and rejuvenates aging cells.  
Oleuropein: Increases BAT activity and promotes healthy cholesterol levels.  
How Does Puravive Promote Weight Loss?  
Puravive addresses the root cause of weight gain: low brown adipose tissue levels. Brown fat, unlike white fat, burns calories to regulate body temperature. It is rich in mitochondria, which convert calories into energy. Higher BAT levels result in more fat burning, and even a small increase in BAT can significantly enhance calorie burning.

1g2ys1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/4hourbodyslowcarb/comments/1g2ys1l/not_losing_weight_on_2nd_week/,Not losing weight on 2nd week,"Hello Guys

I am at the end of my second week of slow-carb diet (2nd Sunday). I did my cheat day last Sunday, and haven't done one on the second week.

I enjoy doing intermittent fasting, which is a habit I took while doing keto in the past. I enjoy not eating until later in the day, as it gives me focus for my work

My diet plan and routine:

* Wake up at 8:00 AM.
   * I drink about 1.5Liters (0.4 gallons) of water in the 1st hour.
   * I do 3 min Cold Plunge at 10ºc (50ºF)
   * I drink coffee after the first hour until noon.
* Lunch at 12h30-1h30 PM - max 400 kcal
   * 2 eggs, half avocato, 50gr of lentils or black beans
   * Coffee for the rest of the afternoon
* Dinner: 6h30 PM, I eat one of the meals below. JUST ONE - max 700 kcal
   * (1) Fish with vegetables or lentils
   * (2) Meat with vegetables or lentils
   * (3) Chicken with lentils
* Until bed (00h00):
   * Lots of water. I usually add apple cider vinegar to it.

My stats when I started:  
I'm 1.74m (5.7 ft), Male, 34 yo, and my goal is 75kg (165lbs)

* 3 days before week 1:
   * 87.7Kg (193 lbs)
   * 29 IMC
   * 24.7% body fat
* End of week 1 (before cheat day)
   * 82.9 kg (182.7 lbs) -> after cheat day: 83.6kg ( 184.3 lbs)
   * 27.4 IMC
   * 22.3% body fat
* End of week 2 (current day, no cheat day)
   * 82.2 kg (181 lbs)
   * 27.1 IMC
   * 21.9% body fat

I don't do any exercise besides the day-to-day walk. I have had a lot of trouble losing weight in the past. Lots of gym and healthy eating didn't do the trick after 28 years old.  
I found out later that I probably have insulin resistance, which made me try keto, which worked like a charm. Went from 95 kg (209 LBS) to 80 kg (176 LBS).

But keto is very restrictive and very easy to mess up. I really would like to try the slow-carb diet, but If I don't see results after 1 month I will have to stop it.

I like this guy, we’ve been flirting for months. A couple of weeks ago I bit the bullet and asked him out. We went to the movies, and had a great time. He asked me to text him when I got home and I did. After we said our “thank you’s” I asked if he’d like to get a coffee the following week. He replied “Of course!” I’m thinking “cool. He’s interested.” I ask if Wednesday works, he says he “thinks so” since he’s not sure, I ask “what about Monday?” And he never replied back. We work for the same company, so a few days later he asked me about something work related, and that was it. 

Change of scene, I have a friend who opened her own business, and she holds fun dynamics every now and then. This week, she had this “blind date” thing where you were supposed to answer a few questions, and she would find a match for you. I wasn’t going to participate, but she texted me saying she found the perfect guy for me. This is something I wouldn’t do, but I said “What the hell, sure.”

The date went unbelievably well, we had a lot in common and he showed so much interest. We both agreed we were looking for something serious, and he kept talking about the future “we should do this and that.” I said I really enjoyed cooking, he said he was looking forward to trying my cooking, and so on. I asked him to go out today, he seems very happy about it and says yes. He asked for my number and Instagram. As we were leaving, I grabbed the name plaque my friend put in my seat. He takes his and says he’s “putting it in his box of memories.” I thought it was sweet. We say goodbye, he turns around and asks me to text him when I get home, because he wants to know I got there safe. 

I get home, text him and say “have a nice night”, he says thanks and that’s it. Yesterday, I asked how he was doing, and he didn’t reply, but we’re supposed to meet today, and he mentioned showing interest is super important to him, so I decide to text him. I said hi, and double checked if we were meeting today. He just said hi, and said “change of plans, they changed my schedule at work so I’m off later than expected.” And that was it. I responded “how about we move it to tomorrow?” And he didn’t reply. 

I’m probably being too much, and I might seem crazy, but I feel like, despite his actions and words on Friday, he’s just not that interested. And I feel so absurd, because I had no idea who this guy was three days ago and now I’m here all worked up about this. 

I feel like the situation with the other guy added to this. It’s like I try to get out of my comfort zone, show interest, I feel like it’s working, and for some reason it’s not. 

I guess I’m taking dating way too seriously, but I really thought it wasn’t that complicated. In my mind, it’s like “you like someone, you let it show. You don’t like someone, you don’t show interest.” But I feel like these guys showed interest and then it all blew up in my face. 

I’m sorry if this is crazy, I’m just feeling a little down, and frustrated and overwhelmed. I didn’t know what else to do, and my mind is going a mile a minute.",1,1728850411.0,askgaybros,8,1.0,False

We didn’t rent a car so we walked to all the Strip casinos. In freaking July! That was the last time I ever did that. 

As we walked by The Sands there was a barker outside hyping their Free Slot Tournament. It was an all day event with winners every hour. The fifty highest scores were invited to play in the Final Round at the end of the day. 

It was my first slot tournament of any kind. The sessions were really short, probably two minutes at the longest. It was clearly well designed. Who can resist a chance to score some cash for free? Ever so easily they pull you in off the street and get you inside the casino.

And believe it or not, I had the highest score of my session. It was also the highest score posted so far that hour. It was 10:25 am. They told me if my score held up for the rest of the hour I would win $50. And at the end of the day, if my score was one of the 50 highest, I would get to play in the Final for a bigger cash prize. 

So we walked down the Strip to the Casino Royale. I wanted to check out their Mini Crap table. Half the size of a real crap table, and run by a single dealer/stickman, it was such a weird game. Back in the day, serious craps players sneered at Mini Craps. That didn’t confront me, I’m not a purist. 

I guess I played just enough to get noticed by a floor supervisor. As I cashed out he dropped a coupon for a free Strawberry Shortcake on the table for us. It was for the snack bar upstairs. I thanked him kindly and we went upstairs and enjoyed the treat. 

That Strawberry Shortcake was my first Comp. I think the cash value was either 99 cents or maybe $1.50. 

We walked back to The Sands to check to see if my score had held up through the rest of the hour. It did! I won $50!  And I had a shot at making it to the Final Round. 

I was so freaking stoked! It was exactly at that moment when I fell hopelessly in love with Las Vegas. 

Sadly my score didn’t hold up and I didn’t make the Final Round. But nevermind the bollocks, I won $50!!!

Plus I got this cool Sands Coffee Mug. Everyone that played in the Free Slot Tournament got one. ",38,1728850162.0,LasVegas,0,1.0,False
