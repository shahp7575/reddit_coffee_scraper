Hi everyone. College kid here. 

I've had a crush on a guy for months now. He's in a masters programme, I'm a bachelor's student. He used to be my TA a year ago. Now not anymore.  We've had casual talks and friendly intellectual interactions at uni. I even asked him out for coffee once before and he actually said yes that time. 


We met up a lot at events and had nice conversations, and he always seemed friendly. Well now before the holidays I gathered up my courage again so we could get to know each other better. 

I basically said: Uhm I was wondering if you'd like to go out for coffee again after the holidays?

He just stared at me and flat out said: Why? 
To like talk about your dissertation? 

I doubled down and said : Not necessarily but to simply hang out. 

There was a 3 second silence and I quickly changed the subject to one of my friends before it got too awkward. He only mentioned some time ago that as a TA he tried avoiding making friends with people he'd grade. I'm not in his classes so...

He never said yes or no. I don't know how to take this as it felt like emotional whiplash and I really was like... what did I do wrong? I've never been asked why before to an invitation.
Like I'm okay if someone doesn't want to but... anyone got ideas to what that was?

I notice that I only get flareups about a day after taking an OTC pain reliever. But it doesn‚Äôt matter what pain reliever, which is the weird part. It could be Tylenol or Ibuprofen, they all do it to me, whether they‚Äôre from the same family of medications or not. So what I observe is that I take the medication, the next day if I‚Äôm exposed to heat, like washing hands, holding my coffee mug, or touching my laptop, I get the flareup. But I wash my hands in hot water, hold a coffee mug and touch my laptop every day. I only get the flareups after pain med. And the size of the outbreak is relative to how much I took. If it‚Äôs only one dose, only one or two little bumps. If I‚Äôm taking it around the clock, big outbreak. When I talked to my doctor about my observation that I only get this after taking pain medicines, she was dismissive. Her feeling was that it was not reported, therefore it‚Äôs probably unrelated. This is really frustrating to me because the reason I even wanted to discuss it is because it‚Äôs a terrible deterrent to taking OTC pain meds, and I‚Äôm not superhuman. I need to be able to take something for pain. 

I came here to share this observation with the hope that I might find others who have noticed a correlation between taking pain meds and flareups. Or, maybe my sharing it will give someone else an epiphany about their own flareups.

I never understood what they meant online, being spoiled and securing a type of lifestyle only the privileged would grasp. 

Until I get free coffees from strangers and surprise discounts, small chatters. I never understood being able to separate your attention to many but I also think it stems from an unhealthy mindset. It‚Äôs not necessarily flirting, since I am not the one doing it. But people tend to‚Ä¶ dip their toes and try to move with it, they seem to persist in their approaches to figure me out. I‚Äôm always polite, most times always detached but flattered to say the least.

And that tears me apart because‚Ä¶ look at the world and all these people, whom I have all a chance with, who insist on keeping me for a time longer before I part ways with these strangers I will never be seeing ever again unless I reciprocate an interest or a glance. Yet, I never do. I refill their doses but always never complete it to the top enough for anything to be concrete or progressive towards something more. It‚Äôs minor daily interactions that have the chance in developing something deeper, and I feel flattered for it but I always just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt.

This furry little beast ran his own cryptocurrency trading office, complete with a tiny wheel connected to a computer. Every time he ran on the wheel, he selected a cryptocurrency to trade. Then, using his ""decision tunnels,"" he chose whether to buy or sell.

Sounds like a joke, right? Well, *Mr. Goxx* actually crushed it. At one point, his portfolio outperformed Bitcoin, the S&P 500, and even Warren Buffet‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway. While everyone else was losing their minds over market crashes, this hamster was casually stacking gains like a true baller.

# Enter Hank: The Hamster Who Took It Further

Inspired by Mr. Goxx‚Äôs success, our boy Hank had bigger dreams. He wasn‚Äôt just about trades‚Äîhe wanted to build a legacy. And his story? Well, it starts in a pet shop, like most hamster tales, but with a twist.

Hank was no ordinary hamster. While his cage-mates were busy hoarding seeds and running in circles, Hank was plotting. He wasn‚Äôt about the wheel life; he wanted more. One fateful night, inspired by the stories of Mr. Goxx and fueled by his own ambition, Hank made his daring escape.

# Hank‚Äôs Rise to Glory

After escaping, Hank found himself in a dingy internet caf√©, where late-night crypto traders yelled at their screens and spilled coffee on their keyboards. That‚Äôs where he discovered *crypto*. For weeks, Hank hid in the shadows, watching traders, learning their patterns, and absorbing every bit of chaos.

But Hank didn‚Äôt just want to trade‚Äîhe wanted to build something. He saw how people rallied around Mr. Goxx and thought, ‚ÄúWhy not take it further?‚Äù He didn‚Äôt just want to hustle; he wanted to create a coin that could unite the degens, the memelords, and the crypto underdogs under one ridiculous banner.

# The Birth of $HHAM

https://preview.redd.it/2irimwpffu7e1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d5302b39aa23554532187f8aacd0eb85f0db400

  


Hank launched **Horny Hamster ($HHAM)** as a nod to his chaotic roots and the hamster legends that came before him. He knew it needed to be more than just another token; it needed to have a story, a purpose, and a vibe.

* **10% Burn Fund:** Because Hank learned from the best‚Äîscarcity equals value.
* **30% Community Fund:** Powered by engagement and referrals. You show up, you bring people in, and you help build the hamster empire.
* **The Rest:** To keep the project running, the hamster wheels spinning, and the community thriving.

# Why $HHAM Is Different

What makes $HHAM special isn‚Äôt just the meme factor (though it‚Äôs top-tier). It‚Äôs the perfect blend of chaos and credibility. The real story of *Mr. Goxx* shows that hamsters can truly outperform expectations. Hank‚Äôs legend adds the spirit, the ambition, and the humor that make this coin more than just a novelty.

This is a token for the underdogs, the dreamers, and the people who look at the hamster wheel of life and say, ‚ÄúF\*\*\* it, let's build a rocket.‚Äù

# The $HHAM Movement

$HHAM isn‚Äôt just a token; it‚Äôs a reminder that even the smallest, scrappiest creature can take on the world. It‚Äôs built on hustle, chaos, and a legacy of internet history that proves hamsters are the **ultimate degens.**

So, is Hank real? Maybe he‚Äôs just a myth, or maybe he‚Äôs running his empire from behind the scenes. What‚Äôs real is the energy, the community, and the vision of **Horny Hamster ($HHAM)**.

Join the movement, embrace the chaos, and let‚Äôs send this furry bastard to the moon. üöÄ

Ever since I got here I‚Äôve just been counting down my days til I leave. Currently at 23 more long days to go. I‚Äôm visiting my brother and my parents flew down too. It‚Äôs so painfully quiet and there is so much tension in the air. He‚Äôs at work most of the day so I‚Äôm home alone with them all day. I don‚Äôt even know why they called me down here. If I try to spark a conversation all I get in response is ‚Äúmm‚Äù, ‚Äúyeah‚Äù, ‚Äúuhuh‚Äù. You get the gist. I feel like I‚Äôm in an emotionally abusive prison. Hasn‚Äôt gotten physical yet, but I feel it coming. We barely ever go out, I‚Äôm confined to these four white walls. I‚Äôm honestly so greatful I have this state exam coming up so I have something to do, study. If I was just vacant I would quite literally lose my mind, even more. I can‚Äôt study in this house. Every 5 minutes someone, espically my mom has an excuse to just barge in. When they know I‚Äôm studying. I can‚Äôt close the door and if I do all hell breaks loose. I can‚Äôt even go to the coffee shop down the block, hell even the library alone, I need to take my father, they don‚Äôt trust me. You might be like but it‚Äôs sweet bonding time for you guys, no. No it‚Äôs not, he doesn‚Äôt even wanna talk to me, if I try to have a conversation it‚Äôs just one word answers or short dry responses I get. I just want some alone time, where I can sit in peace and breathe. I‚Äôm walking on egg shells around them. You know I‚Äôve been trying for 20 years for them to like me, how much longer do I keep going? I‚Äôm just so tired. 

On top of all this, I just broke it off with this guy I was going out with. His ex is crazy, like actually psycho. She found my address and she makes new fake accounts and dms me all this bs, tries threatening me, harrasing me. I replied once, she got my account banned for a couple weeks?? Now I just block and report. So to just avoid and cut this unnecessary drama out of my life, I had to cut him off. Plus if I‚Äôm to get caught talking to a guy, that will be the last day I will see light. I‚Äôm not taking any chances since i‚Äôm here. I really liked him though, I finally found someone who liked me, for me. Saw something past my face and body, who wasn‚Äôt just talking to me to get in my pants. I cry myself to sleep everynight, quietly. Can‚Äôt be too loud since I have to share the bed with her. I can‚Äôt even use the bathroom in peace since she just unlocks the door and barges in. Can‚Äôt be on my phone around them or its like an invitaion to them to check my phone, can‚Äôt wear this, can‚Äôt do my makeup like that, can‚Äôt look presentable when we‚Äôre out since it attarcts too much attention from men and makes her feel some type of way? Yet she calls me the ugly one, constantly comparing me to my oldest sister. Even said I wish your sister came to visit instead of you. I was in a good mood, the song Hey Jude by the beatles was playing and i started singling along, she said pfft stop, you sound terrible. Your sister sings so much better. I just stay quiet around them now, lost in my thoughts. I feel myself losing my spark again, that spark I worked so hard to gain again after I left their house. Im meeting them again after 2 years and I realized really can‚Äôt have shit. The house I‚Äôm so patiently waiting to go back is another prison, my sisters place. Where I‚Äôm literally a maid. I‚Äôm a fulltime college student in prenursing, but I have to cook and clean, look after her babies, and deal with her husband hitting on me, ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù touching me, dropping sly hints, coming into my room at night. He hasn‚Äôt done anything and i hope he doesn‚Äôt. UGH this shit pisses me off so bad. Then I have to deal with their constant fighting, got replaced with my parents constant fighting. I can‚Äôt say no cause I live in their house rent free, so they expect to do all this to make up for it. I cannot wait to get into university so I can move on campus and just get away from all this. My other sister left home cause she couldn‚Äôt deal with all this, and honestly I don‚Äôt blame her. She‚Äôs living her best life, but she cut me off. We were so close, she was literally my best friend but she decided to stop keeping in contact with me. I hit her up multiple times but I could tell she doesn‚Äôt wanna talk to me. I gave up but i wish i still had her, since she‚Äôs the only person who understood me. I don‚Äôt rlly have friends, always end up getting snaked. Can‚Äôt even talk to anyone about anything. 

Anyways I decided if I just act like the bigger person and act like nothing ever happened in the past shit will become normal with my parents, WRONG. Yet I‚Äôm reminded everyday of what a burden I am, how I was a mistake, and she should‚Äôve just gone thorugh with aborting me. That is probably the only time they talk to me. This world would be a better place without me, I really feel like a burden. Last of four kids with huge age gaps from all, my parents hate me. They both are old my dads damn near 70 and my moms going through meopause so she is always in a bad mood, or maybe thats just really her. I never got to know my parents cause they were too busy with my siblings, they just forgot about me. Ive always been sidelined, the invisible one. I‚Äôve just shut my mind off at this point. Can‚Äôt even sm0ke mary jane, I could really use a fat blunt right now. 3 weeks sober since im here. I‚Äôm so broke on top off all this, I can‚Äôt even move out. When I started working a job again, I didn‚Äôt even tell them at first because I knew they would flip their shit, which they did, I had to quit my job. Didn‚Äôt really mind doing it at that point since I was leaving for Texas in a couple weeks and my boss used to sexually harass me all the time and I had enough of that. I was trying to save for a car, but with the little bit I had saved I started using it, since I had no money left. on top of that my sister started taking some from me cause ‚Äúmoney was tight for her‚Äù and wouldn‚Äôt pay me back since ‚Äúi live under her roof, for free‚Äù. 
I have to take the bus, and it‚Äôs so frustrating. Transit is not for the weak in socal. I get catcalled, harrased, followed or groped every other day. It‚Äôs a good day if I didn‚Äôt. Pepper spray can only do so much. It‚Äôs hard being a girl. ",1,1734630597.0,venting,1,1.0,False

As soon as I saw the news about Fellow releasing a coffee machine I knew I had to get it and I immediately put a deposit down for the Aiden launch. For context, I‚Äôm a huge Fellow Coffee fan, I have the manual kettle, Shimmy sifter, Ode Grinder (Gen 1 with upgraded Gen 2 Burrs). Obviously for me the product came with a lot of hype and I was beyond excited to receive the Aiden. Initially it took some time to get used to the machine and even using the presets for the special launch coffees weren‚Äôt giving me optimal brews. I played around a lot with grind sizes and sifting. Naturally I questioned the purchase all together at times. However when the latest update came, which allowed customizing brews using the Fellow app I decided to play around a little and I think I finally cracked the code.

I noticed that the presets were not allowing a proper bloom so I extended the bloom time as well as increased the temperature of the water and came up with the below brew method that has been amazing. For further information I am using an ode grinder with gen 2 burrs on 4 2/3 setting, the water is Wegmans Purified (Kirkland also works well), I pre-wet my filter and I sift my grinded beans using a fellow shimmy. For those of you who have Scandinavian/Light Roasts I highly recommend this method and I would love to hear your results!

My question to you is do you have a sausage recipe that would fit this place/time period that may have been handed down that you would be willing to share? Here is some context that may help find what I am looking for...

I recall spending a few weeks one summer with some relatives that lived just outside of Shady Valley, TN back in the early '70's. I am sure I was kin to them, but not a Nephew, I called them Aunt and Uncle and was young enough not to question or worry about it. Their place was ""back aways"" off a side road or two from Hwy 421 in a little draw (or fairly flattened holler).  They had electricity and well water via hand pump but used wood in the cook stove and had a coal pot belly stove in the middle of the little house. There was sink in the kitchen but it drained to the outside through the wall. And yes, only a single-seat outhouse down by a little creek that ran through the place. I was there to help put up the garden and other chores they were getting too old to perform (mend the fence, patch holes in the roof, etc.). I also got to relieve them of milking the couple of cows they had and feeding the chickens, guineas and pigs. The highlight of the stay was I got to use Benny to pull a tiny cart around and drag a little layover plow once the garden was ready to be turned under. Benny was a Shetland pony.

They had a root cellar that must have housed 250 mason jars filled with beans, okra, pickles, apples, carrots, chow chow, apple sauce, jelly, preserves and even, sausage. The sausage was cooked and was more ball than patty shaped. The jars were not packed tight and had lots of air space around the sausage. The jars were stored upside down and the fat solidified in the bottom quarter or so of the jar. My aunt would turn the jar right side up and set it on the back of the stove while making the rest of the breakfast. I watched the fat slowly melt and the settle to the bottom of the jar. She made what she called spoon bread (drop biscuits) and would use the grease from the jar to brown the flour in for the gravy and added the sausage and let it simmer toward the end at it got to the right thickness. My Uncle drank his coffee using a cup and saucer. He would take the old enameled pot off the stove and pour boiling hot coffee in the cup. He would then tip the cup slightly and let it fill the saucer to cool off before drinking out of the saucer. The plates of drop biscuits and gravy hit the table and were gone in no time. The sausage was different than any I had ever had in my young life and I have never tasted any like it sense.",6,1734630303.0,Appalachia,0,1.0,False

I played the tape forward, and I was panicking so hard from anxiety (and two cups of coffee to help me prep a babysitter for our second night away from our toddler in over a year) that when the waiter popped in, it was like a perfect storm.

I‚Äôm so disappointed.

I was the youngest wife by 10 years, amid a small party consisting of ultra rich corporate executives, medical directors, and cardiologists, to which I was questioning every aspect of my being. Couldn‚Äôt understand how I ended up here at dinners like *this*, with people like *these*, forgetting who my husband is.

I was dressed to the nines, and overly complimented by the group to the point that one of the women seemed back-handed. It was so intimidating. I had to constantly fix my posture, maintain eye contact, laugh at everything when I was so anxious.

I drank two glasses of wine, the second glass I was sure to leave two sips left. As I drank the second glass I actually chose to drink it slower than everyone else at the table. Crazy.

Maybe it was the coffee, or the anxiety, but the alcohol helped make me tachycardic all evening! While I‚Äôm not hungover, this morning I feel like total shit. I have this feeling of impending doom from the countless times I‚Äôve been so hungover, knowing that at some point I‚Äôll sober up.

This wasn‚Äôt something I could get out of, with my spouse being a big-wig in his group, he needed me present despite all we (and I) are going through.

I just can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt have the strength. Day one :(, for the millionth time.

Quick context: we‚Äôve been together for 4 years and recently got engaged earlier this year. We also got pregnant and I ended up giving birth prematurely to our son, who is currently in the NICU until his due date in January. 

My fianc√© is very particular and organized about things just to preface this, but I feel like it reached a tipping point this morning. 

We woke up a little later this morning (8:30ish), and he started on about how he was going to start waking me up earlier so we can get the day started earlier. He kept going on about how I‚Äôve been sleeping in too much lately and the importance of waking up on time. (His alarm went off at 6am and he snoozed it, but okay. He also was up until 2am watching TV downstairs with the volume all the way up.) 

Then, as I‚Äôm in our bathroom starting to brush my teeth, he calls me into the room and asks me if I touched the thermostat (we‚Äôre in Texas and the weather has been hot one day and freezing the next), I said yes because I got cold. He proceeds to fuss at me saying that I could break the air conditioning unit by having it on two different settings (the downstairs thermostat was still on cool), I tried to explain that it was late and I was tired and didn‚Äôt think to go downstairs and change that one too, but he kept cutting me off saying I was being ‚Äúdefensive‚Äù. He ended it by saying ‚Äúdo you understand?‚Äù It felt like I was being fussed at by a parent. 

I went downstairs and started making my coffee. He comes downstairs and asks me to make an omelette (I am not good at making omelette and they always turn into a scramble). I told him no because I didn‚Äôt want to be criticized for that too. He said I was being petty and that I overreacted for that response.

1hhyf42,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1hhyf42/new_nurse_should_i_quit/,"New nurse, should I quit? ","I graduated with my LPN this September and found a job relatively quickly at a surgery center working pre-op/post-op making pretty decent money. Since I‚Äôm currently still going to school to get my RN, I can only work 2 days a week. 

It started off great but the nurse that trained me kind of just told me to do things without ever actually taking the time to explain to me why things need to be done. Even if I‚Äôd ask her answers felt kind of like ‚Äúyou should know this‚Äù type answers so it got to the point where I‚Äôd just feel judged for asking questions. I was doing the job, but I would say I did not understand the importance of certain things or fully understood how different surgical patients should be handled post operatively. She would always kind of just take over and she knew exactly what to do for each one, but I still didn‚Äôt. 

Anyways, a month into training me she walked out on the job due to management issues. I‚Äôll be honest, the place is a shit show. Four people have left in the two months I‚Äôve worked there. She left at the beginning of my Christmas break, and I had agreed to work as much as possible during this break. With her gone they had absolutely no one to do pre op and post op but me. I‚Äôd also like to add that before I got hired, the post op nurse quit, so the pre-op nurse was already doing two people‚Äôs jobs. With her gone all of it was dumped on me. 

They had me working on surgery days I‚Äôve never been trained on, winging it giving discharge instructions, giving meds I‚Äôve never been trained to give. I brought up multiple times to them that I can‚Äôt balance both pre and post op. It was way too much. Especially with 10 minute surgery turnover rates. This resulted in me having a mental breakdown at work on multiple occasions. Everyone in that building knew it was too much for me and now finally after weeks of this and a medication error on my end (thankfully minor, but still unacceptable) I‚Äôm finally starting to get help from the staff. 

This moment is what really got to me, though. We had a company Christmas party. All was well, and after the fact we all went out to dinner to celebrate. Then, my manager called to tell us to come back for a mandatory meeting. I shit you not, it felt like she was talking directly to me, just in front of everyone. It felt like public humiliation. She said that the patients aren‚Äôt getting offered enough water, crackers, and juice before discharge and that they need to be wheeled out to their cars instead of wheeling them out to the lobby. 

This is so irritating because truthfully on those quick surgery days I‚Äôm just trying to survive. I don‚Äôt have time to sit there while my patient eats crackers. I don‚Äôt have time to let them wait 20 minutes in the ONE wheelchair we have for their ride to show up so that I can wheel them out to it. It‚Äôs so frustrating because on the slower days I will literally make my patients coffee and put in so much effort to this job because I love when I have the time to do that for them. 

For her to bring up my short comings in a room filled with the entire staff felt so humiliating. At the end of the meeting she looked at me and asked if I had anything to add and I told her that for me to continue working there I will no longer be doing both pre-op and post-op on the quick surgery days. But honestly? I think I‚Äôm ready to leave. 

I feel like I deserved better training. Most days I feel like I‚Äôm winging it, especially with post op patients and instructions and I feel like that isn‚Äôt fair to them. And it makes me feel like a total idiot. But how am I supposed to know things I wasn‚Äôt trained on? This job has made me feel so completely stupid and incompetent and even unsafe at times.

1hhyc7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1hhyc7q/christians/,Christians.,"I work for a local supplement manufacturing company. During the interview, everything seemed fine and dandy and there was no sign of any sort of Bible belting. Flash forward to when I actually started, day one my car battery died in the parking lot so I was out there past hours getting it fixed. A few days after that, I got introduced to someone, and he asked if I was the one with the car troubles. I said yes and that my battery died and how stressful it all was, and his response was ""Oh I wish I would've caught you so I could pray over it for you."" That's when I realized what kind of place I started working at.

There's quite a few instances of shit like this, but what I heard from my supervisor today took the cake. Last week when I came in on Monday, I went to the break room to put my lunch up like usual, and every Monday they have Bible study in the public breakroom of all places. I'm already uncomfortable walking in every time to begin with, but then my CEO asks me if I wanted to join Bible study after I obviously avoid it every single week. I just say I don't believe in God and walk out. The next day, I went to the breakroom to warm my lunch up, and the dude that leads the Bible study was in there getting coffee. He doesn't even work here. He confronted me about not believing in God and asked if I wanted to talk about it, I said I have religious trauma and immediately get cut off with ""Oh no no no"" and he goes on a whole schpeel about a documentary  with people ""just like me"" and whatever. I was filling my water cup up so I couldn't just walk away, but I tuned out pretty much everything he said after that. When I was done, he asked if I wanted to join something with him and I immediately said no and walked the fuck out before this old man gets punched in his chest. I spent the rest of the week just avoiding as many people as possible.

Now today. I was talking to my supervisor about some things, and I ended up bringing up my issues with all the religious stuff being shoved down my throat. I'm very non-confrontational so bringing up anything makes me nervous, but it is an issue that bothers me almost daily. I told him about the encounter last week. Apparently after that happened, the old dude was trying to talk to my supervisor about it. Thankfully my supervisor isn't pushy and I've already told him about my beliefs, or lack of beliefs, and he's understanding. I guess old dude was telling him I wasn't having any of the god talk. Big deal, get over it. Then I hear that old dude was basically saying it's NOT okay for me to be the way I am. So now I have this old man who doesn't even work here denying my beliefs, and discriminating against me yay!!!

I'm very big on ""to each their own"", I don't care what you believe in as long as you respect others. I am SO. FUCKING. TIRED. of the extreme Christians ALWAYS shoving their beliefs down your throat, and now that I have it at my job, the place I spend most of the waking hours of my life at. I'm aware it's illegal to discriminate against religion in the workplace, I'm working up the courage to do something about it. I would go to HR, but HR is just as preachy as the rest so that trip is basically worthless. Religion does NOT belong in the workplace. I can't wait to leave.",1,1734629926.0,antiwork,5,0.55,False

I remember Nordstroms being high quality fabrics and great designs. I was shocked to find SHEIN-esque goods everywhere. Like anything that was even remotely nice quality was $300+ for a single item. It was embarrassing for Nordstroms and depressing to me as a consumer.

Then I thought about how the barstools I just ordered were similar. $200 for some janky seats. No doubt all of this is leading to pollution and landfill waste. I know that 80% of what I buy today won‚Äôt last more than 1-2 years if I‚Äôm lucky. Obviously better items are out there, but they are currently out of budget for me (and I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs this way for most others).

If I had a magic wand, I‚Äôd make a law that says every product has to withstand 5-years of normal use. This would be done through a testing center/controlled environment independent of the company. The product would be tested for 5-years, used as normal, and must still work without major flaws at that time. So for example, clothing would need to go through the wash for 5 years and be worn maybe 1-4 times a month. Coffee machines and couches would need to be used daily and still hold up. This would force companies to go back to making high quality goods. If there was a valid reason their product couldn‚Äôt/shouldn‚Äôt last that long, they could submit that reasoning to an independent board (with persons on the consumers side involved) and a decision would be made on whether the time period should be shorter. Also, they could only charge the consumer no more than 5x what it cost to make the good (idk how much things are up charged, but I‚Äôm trying to think of a reasonable amount. Employee wages would be accounted for, although I don‚Äôt know if this would hurt or help the employees so this would probably need its own regulation; it would, however, give the consumer more transparency to see how much a company was paying its employees based on the cost of the good). 

A magic wand scenario obviously doesn‚Äôt account for how difficult this would be to implement or the various issues that could arise trying to implement it, although I think solutions could be found‚Äî but if you had a magic wand, what law or regulation would you put in place?

Edit: some words.

I just wanted to share that I provisionally passed CISSP this week on my first attempt.

100 questions and 40 minutes remaining (not a native English speaker and slow test taker). I studied for 5 months (2 months intensively).

Background about me: I have a degree in Electronics Engineering and a total of 10 years of experience in IT, a combination of Networking, Security, and Cloud (mostly Operations). I decided to push for CISSP way back in 2019, but COVID happened, and lockdowns and all meant I wasn‚Äôt able to focus on studying. Fast forward to August 2024, I decided to push and become CISSP-certified.

my old post 6 years ago:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/azivbl/is\_it\_possible\_to\_pass\_the\_cissp\_exam\_in\_2\_months/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/comments/azivbl/is_it_possible_to_pass_the_cissp_exam_in_2_months/)

Prep and journey

Hardest part of me is the switch of mindset from a technical person to CISSP. I used up my first 2 months in prep learning the scope, topics on each domains and mindset. I thought, changing mindset is one of the most difficult part for me.

3rd month, I focused on each domains deep dive, i identified which domain is my weakest and most comfortable (my weakest was 1 and 8 and comfortable were 4 and 7 others are on par). One thing for sure while learning/studying CISSP is that most of my company's management team has started to make sense on their decisions, how they run things, bcp, audit etc. before, i didn't understood it, just blindly follow what is instructed to me. Gaining these knowledge from studying alone is super beneficial.

Here are some of my resources:

Quantum Exam - This is a game changer. If I had to choose between Peace of Mind and QE, definitely QE (but I ended up buying both, lol, though I bought POM first).

LearnApp - Bought a 3-month subscription; exam readiness was 55%, but I didn‚Äôt complete this since I used it mostly for flashcards. I focused on QE.

Mike Chapple‚Äôs OSG and LinkedIn Learning materials.

Thor‚Äôs Udemy and Practice Questions.

Luke Ahmed‚Äôs book and study notes.

Kelly‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhy You Will Pass the CISSP Exam.‚Äù

Pete‚Äôs Exam Cram + Addendum (I was lucky enough to join his last live 100 Questions) + Last Mile.

Prabh‚Äôs coffee shots and snacks.

Prashant Mohan‚Äôs Memory Palace.

Destination Cert - MindMaps (printed these) and Concise Guide Book.

50 CISSP Hard Questions.

Exam Experience:

IT WAS BRUTAL! CAT WAS BRUTAL, but yeah, it‚Äôs doable. Early on in the exam, I felt exhausted, mentally and physically drained. At question 25, I felt like I just wanted to end this exam and move on. I already thought about which topics I was weak in and needed to study because CAT was a mofo that can smell your weakness. Please hydrate, make sure you're on your best shape.

Exam questions were vague and crazy. QE is the closest practice question I did in terms of wording. I did thousands of practice questions, and none of them‚Äînada, null, zero‚Äîwas repeated. Also, try not to JUST memorize the process/steps. Understand and learn it by heart and JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION!

Lastly, you will never know when you‚Äôre ready. There‚Äôs no indicator of exam readiness. Go back to your notes and mind maps and see if things are making sense. If you‚Äôre able to explain the RMF, Incident Response, DRP, and BCP (and many more), you‚Äôre on the right track. Be open minded The exam is not just about knowing how things work; it‚Äôs about how you apply them in a scenario, testing if you really understand it.

You can do it!!

[‚Ç¨50],"Hi, it‚Äôs my first post here and I‚Äôm a beginner in the home-barista field (many years of experience in many coffee bar where I live in Italy).
My budget is very low and my current set-up is made of a Delonghi ECP, a standard bottomless portafilter and a cheap Aliexpress hand grinder with ceramic burrs.
Although it‚Äôs not ideal and I don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôs going to last, I‚Äôm managing to achieve a good quality of grind for what I paid, 15gr in - 30gr out extraction in 27/32 secs -using a puck screen- with no channelling or sprays.
The flavor profile I‚Äôm achieving is not perfect as the beans I‚Äôm working with are not really fresh atm, resulting in a little bit of bitterness no matter what I do.
All things considered, It could be much worse. 
The only ‚Äúproblem‚Äù I have right now is with ceramic burrs the time to grind is 4-5 minutes for 15gr, making it less desirable to deal-in. 
I‚Äôve looked at some cheap electric grinders but with my budget it seems impossible to buy something good, even in the used market. 
I stumbled across a used Delonghi KG79 for ‚Ç¨20 (so very cheap) and I know it could be modded to achieve espresso grind. I also know that it comes with what‚Äôs called ‚Äúfalse burrs‚Äù.

My question is: am I better off with my ‚Ç¨10 hand grinder (that has proper conical burrs)? Would the grind quality of a modded KG79 be at least comparable to my current set-up?
Should I just wait and look for a used Baratza Encore hoping for a good price?
Would it be better a ‚Ç¨30 stainless steel hand grinder?
My priority is obviously the quality of the grind, but if I could go from 5 minutes to even half the time it would speed up a lot the process‚Ä¶

He does know I want him gone, though, and that I wont be renewing the contract.  But he is the second worst person I've ever lived with, and that is really saying something because I had to get a restraining order against a past roommate because she was literally stalking me after she left.  

He refuses to get his cat fixed, even though I have told him multiple times I need him to do that because his cat is aggressive to mine and is peeing outside the litterbox.  Trust me, I am adding that the pet has to be spayed or neutered to the contract when he's gone, I've learned my fucking lesson.

He has WAY too much stuff.  When he asked to store some things here, I thought it would be a reasonable amount.  It is not!  Both couches are covered in his things, as well as the coffee table, the kitchen table, and most of the counter/bar space.  I literally have to eat in my room, there is no other place.  He has piles of things in the spare bedroom, the living room, and a corner of the kitchen as well.  I told him to get a storage unit and he says he can't afford it.  I wanted to invite some friends over to watch a movie and I literally had to tell him several days in advance so that I would have a couch and an unblocked view of the television, and all of the stuff was back the next day.  

He is smoking in the house.  He says he isn't, but he absolutely is, I can smell it.  It would not be this strong if it was on the balcony with the door closed.  I came home early from work about three weeks ago and actually caught him smoking weed in his bathroom.  I gave him a warning then but he clearly hasn't stopped, since I smelled it this morning after I got home from my overnight job.  Recreational marijuana is not legal where I live, and I have it in the contract that there are no drugs in the house.

He makes and leaves messes in the kitchen sink.  We have a dishwasher, so I genuinely do not understand why he doesn't just rinse his dishes and put them in the dishwasher.  Or if he doesn't want to use it, he needs to be washing them by hand and putting them away before they start to smell.  He has also never once vacuumed or swept the floor since he got here last year, I do it every single time.

I'm at my wits end.  I came home today and I realized I'm living in a house that is cluttered and smells bad and I can't fucking stand it, I'm an organized and clean person. I cannot wait until he is gone.  And if he thinks he is getting all of his deposit back he is kidding himself, I'm going to have to hire a professional to get the cat pee and smoke smell out of the carpet, he'll be paying for that.

God sorry that's long, I've been holding it in so I can remain polite with him.  But two months until he is gone.  Just two months more.

1hhy28o,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1hhy28o/so_you_wanna_try_the_carnivore_diet/,So you wanna try the Carnivore Diet?!,"OK - So I am mostly writing this to have for Jan 2025 (Carnivore Month) so that I can link people back to it instead of retyping everything over and over.  But I am also seeing lots of new people posting new questions about Carnivore. I have been carnivore for 2.25 years, dropped 130lbs, and live typically on beef, eggs, salt, water, & coffee.    
  
So ... here is an overall intro to it. I will keep this in bullets for ease of reading:

* Rule 1 - **YOU** have to find out what works best for you.  This will be a lot of trail and error and fine tuning.  **YOUR** journey is different than mine. 
* **THIS IS NOT A WEIGHT LOSS DIET!!!**  For love of all things that are good...It is a body healing diet or a body optimization diet.  Yes, with that often comes weight loss.  BUT...for some underweight people it helps them gain which is what they need.  For others, who have massive autoimmune or gut issues...your body may feel it is more important to fix that than getting you ""Summer ready.""  If you are looking to crash 30 lbs... I truly would not recommend this diet - it's a way of eating and not to be meddled with as far as jumping on and off.  Weight loss will likely happen, but this diet is about trusting your body and letting it do its thing.  Learn to listen to it. 
* What to eat - This ranges from the lion diet (beef, salt, & water) to what most people do (beef, eggs, bacon, salt, & water) to some lesser strict options that include cheese and dairy.  Just remember, everyone's body reacts to things differently.
* Calories **DO NOT MATTER** and do not count them.  Your body is not an incinerator.  You chemically digest food...you do not ""burn"" it.
* When carnivores talk about eating a lot of fat, many will say they do not track how much they eat.  They just say ""I eat fatty meat until it doesn't taste good"" or ""I eat fatty meat until I am satiated.""  While this is true its a confusing measurement for newbies.  Maybe, like me, you're a habitual OVER eater and don't have an off switch.  For that reason I am adding that when people on the carnivore diet say ""eat more fat"" we are typically eating 150g-300g of fat per day based on body mass.  I bring up a number because many newbies think 60g of fat is a lot... to a carnivore 60g is comical.  By a lot of fat we literally mean 150g-300g.  Again this all is based on how you feel.  As a starting point - aim for your goal body weight in grams and adjust from there. 
* Protein - chances are if you are eating enough fat as mentioned above you will be fine on protein.  But if you are someone who wants a number - start with your goal body weight and then experiment from there. 
* Salt - Buy good salt.  People swear by Redmond's or Celtic salt. Just get a high quality salt.  You can salt to your taste - no worry about too much.  Truly, you can salt as heavy as you like.  As an add on - I suffered from leg cramps for 18 months on carnivore without being able to find out what the cause was.  A friend bought me Baja Gold salt off Amazon to try.  Oddly enough, 1 TSP in water everyday and boom... cramps are gone none in over a month now and if I stop for 1-2 days ... they come back.    No idea what specifically is in the salt THAT helps...but the salt is what helped!  (#ThanksMel!)
* Water - drink when thirsty.  Monitor your pee for smell/cloudiness and adjust as needed. 
* Coffee/Tea - your choice.  Strict people don't others do.  Everyone has opinions.  Most say to just keep it as clean as you can - only adding butter or heavy whipping cream.
* Dairy - As mentioned above, everyone is different.  Dairy is allowed on the diet just stay to clean cheese - no add ins.  But...you will learn that many carnivores find weight loss stalls when dairy is involved.  I personally use dairy as my treat meals 1-2 times a month.  Specifically - many people feel better removing butter for tallow. 
* Alcohol - Again, your choice.  Many are against it, but I as an example enjoy it from once a week with a cigar.  That said - you need to know that how your body processes alcohol is gonna change majorly!  You are about to become an ultimate lightweight and if you push it ... you wont remember your night. 
* Pooping - The fun topic.  For the first 10 days up to 21 days typically...expect some diarrhea.  Joe Rogan famously called it rocketing diarrhea - I found it was just often but never and emergency ""OMFG I'm gonna shit my pants!"" situation.  My daughter transitioned while going to high school and never had an issue.  Once you acclimate, it is very normal to only go 1-2 times a week.  That is because your body isn't wasting anything.  As you get acclimated - if you have diarrhea you can throttle back some fat - just balance it with your energy.   
* Trial and Error/Adjustments - OK I have mentioned a few times that you will tinker with this diet for how it fits you.  That is true, but that comes after the acclimation period which is usually 30 days.  After that... you can kind of play with it.  When you do its best to test something for 2-3 weeks by making small changes - if you make changes daily...you wont know what to associate the good/bad change too. 
* Listen to your body it's a walking miracle of biochemistry.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for your health and wellness. But how much should you actually drink each day? The answer isn't one-size-fits-all; it varies based on your age, weight, activity level, and the climate where you live. Keeping this in mind, it's important to understand the transformative effects of proper hydration on your daily life.

### The Benefits of Staying Hydrated

Drinking enough water can significantly change the way you feel and function. Here are some key benefits:

- **Improves Physical Performance:** When you're dehydrated, your physical performance can suffer. This is particularly noticeable during intense exercise. Staying hydrated can help improve endurance and strength.
- **Enhances Brain Function:** Your brain is around 75% water. Even mild dehydration can disrupt your concentration, increase fatigue, and make it harder to think clearly.
- **Aids Digestion:** Water is essential for your digestive system. It helps break down food so your body can absorb nutrients and prevents constipation.
- **Boosts Mood:** Dehydration can affect your mood. Studies show that staying hydrated can lead to reduced feelings of confusion, tension, and anger.
- **Promotes Healthy Skin:** Proper hydration can help improve your skin‚Äôs elasticity and reduce the appearance of dryness and flakiness.

### Determining Your Daily Water Intake

So, how much water should you drink each day? A common guideline is the 8x8 rule: drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. This equals about 2 liters or half a gallon. However, other factors can influence your hydration needs:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Body Weight:** A good rule of thumb is to divide your weight in pounds by two. This number is a rough estimate of the number of ounces you should drink each day. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, aim for about 75 ounces of water.
- **Activity Level:** If you exercise, you'll need to replenish the fluids lost through sweat. Consider drinking an extra 1.5 to 2.5 cups (12-20 ounces) of water for short bouts of intense exercise.
- **Environment:** Hot or humid weather can make you sweat more, leading to increased water needs. Similarly, high altitudes can dehydrate you more quickly.
- **Health Conditions:** Certain health issues, like fever, vomiting, or diarrhea, increase your need for fluids. Pregnant or breastfeeding women also have higher hydration needs.

### Signs of Dehydration

It‚Äôs important to recognize when your body needs more water. Common signs of dehydration include:

- Thirst
- Dark yellow urine
- Dry mouth
- Fatigue
- Dizziness or lightheadedness

### Tips to Stay Hydrated

Staying hydrated doesn‚Äôt have to be a chore. Here are some simple strategies to help you meet your daily water goals:

- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Keeping water handy can remind you to drink more throughout the day.
- **Infuse Your Water:** Adding fruits or herbs to your water can make it more enjoyable, encouraging you to drink more.
- **Set Reminders:** Use phone apps or alarms to remind you to drink water regularly.

The Relationship Between Hydration and Physical Performance
-----------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential to our health, but what many people overlook is its crucial role in physical performance. When you hydrate properly, you maximize your body‚Äôs potential and ensure that every workout, game, or physical activity is performed at its best.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Your body is about 60% water, and every cell relies on this vital fluid to function optimally. Hydration affects muscle metabolism, energy levels, and even your mood during workouts. When you‚Äôre dehydrated, your body cannot perform at its full capacity. Let‚Äôs explore how hydration impacts your physical performance.

### Importance of Staying Hydrated

Physical activities lead to sweat loss, which means you‚Äôre losing water and electrolytes. This loss can result in dehydration if you don‚Äôt replenish fluids adequately. Here are some key aspects of hydration and performance:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Enhanced Endurance:** Staying hydrated helps maintain blood volume and regulates body temperature. This is crucial during prolonged exercise. Studies show that even a 2% decrease in body weight due to dehydration can negatively affect endurance.
- **Improved Strength and Power:** Water aids in nutrient transport and helps maintain muscle function. Dehydration can lead to decreases in speed, power, and overall strength, disrupting your workouts and performance.
- **Better Focus:** Dehydration can cause fatigue and impair cognitive functions. This includes your ability to focus during physical activities. Staying hydrated keeps your mind sharp and your body responsive.

### How Much Water Should You Drink?

The amount of water you should drink varies according to factors such as your weight, activity level, and climate. A general guideline is to drink at least 8-10 cups (64-80 ounces) of water per day. Here are some tailored tips for different situations:

- **Light Activity:** For casual activities or light workouts, aim for the 8 cups a day guideline.
- **Moderate Activity:** If you engage in moderate exercise, increase your intake to about 10-12 cups a day, especially on workout days.
- **Intense Exercise:** For heavy training or hot conditions, it‚Äôs essential to drink from 12 cups or more, depending on the amount of sweat you produce.

### Signs of Dehydration to Watch For

Your body provides signals to let you know when it needs water. It‚Äôs vital to listen. Here are common signs of dehydration:

Myths and Facts About Daily Water Intake
----------------------------------------

Many people believe that water is just water, but when it comes to daily water intake, myths are plentiful. Understanding these misconceptions can help you stay hydrated and healthy. Let‚Äôs dive into some common myths and the facts that debunk them.

### Myth 1: You Need to Drink Eight Glasses of Water a Day

One popular myth is that everyone needs to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily. While this guideline is easy to remember, it's not necessarily accurate for everyone. The amount of water you need depends on various factors, including age, sex, activity level, and climate.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
For many people, the best approach is to listen to your body. Thirst is a natural indicator. If you're feeling thirsty, it‚Äôs a good sign that your body needs hydration. Other factors like exercise and weather can also increase your requirements. Here‚Äôs a simple formula to help gauge your needs:

- Take your body weight in pounds.
- Divide that number by two.
- The result is the number of ounces of water you should aim for daily.

### Myth 2: All Hydration Comes from Drinking Water

Another myth is that the only way to stay hydrated is through drinking water. This is not entirely true. While water is vital, many foods and beverages also contribute to your overall hydration.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Fruits and vegetables have high water content and can boost your hydration levels. Examples include:

- Watermelon
- Cucumbers
- Strawberries
- Lettuce

Additionally, other beverages, like herbal teas or broths, can help keep you hydrated throughout the day.

### Myth 3: You Can‚Äôt Drink Too Much Water

While staying hydrated is crucial, drinking excessive amounts of water can actually be harmful. This condition is known as water intoxication or hyponatremia, where sodium levels in your blood drop dangerously low due to dilution. Symptoms can range from nausea to serious complications like seizures.

It‚Äôs vital to balance your water intake with your body's needs. If you‚Äôre primarily sedentary, you might not need to drink as much as someone who‚Äôs physically active. Listen to your body and adjust accordingly.

### Myth 4: Your Urine Color is Not an Indicator of Hydration

Some people think that urine color has no relation to hydration status. In reality, urine color can be a helpful gauge of your hydration. Ideally, your urine should be pale yellow. Darker urine can indicate that you may need to drink more water.

Keep in mind, though, that certain foods and medications can cause changes in urine color, so it‚Äôs essential to consider these factors.

### Myth 5: Caffeinated Drinks Dehydrate You

It‚Äôs commonly believed that caffeinated beverages like coffee and tea will dehydrate you. While caffeine has a mild diuretic effect, studies show that moderate consumption does not lead to dehydration.

These beverages still contribute to your daily fluid intake, so enjoy them in moderation and include them in your hydration calculations.

1hhxya6,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hhxya6/unsure_if_coffee_is_suppressing_my_appetite_or/,Unsure if coffee is suppressing my appetite or just growing it ,"I lost weight by dieting (just eating less generally). About 87 lbs so far. For most of that time I was drinking coffee maybe 2 to 3 times a day, but I'm not sure to what effect it was suppressing my appetite. I was feeling pretty hungry for several hours a day even with coffee, then I got off coffee for about a month and I didn't notice any discernable change in appetite. 

However it's possible my body was tolerant to coffee which may have negated the usual appetite-suppressing effect of coffee. Once I got on it again after a month without it, I noticed that coffee would delay my hunger for about an hour at most, sometimes half an hour. When I got hungry again I didn't necessarily feel hungrier (the rebound hunger some people talk about) I just felt the same hunger + a weird low blood sugar feeling.

When I read up on this stuff I get some conflicting information. It seems coffee suppresses appetite for most people, but coffee apparently decreases blood sugar in some people and that can provoke hunger. I usually put sugar in my coffee and I sometimes alternate between sweetened and unsweetened, but I didn't notice a difference in hunger between the two. 

From what I've read, for some people putting sugar in coffee helps counteract the blood sugar drop caused by coffee (and thus the subsequent hunger) but for some people the sugar only increases appetite since for some people a small blood sugar increase will increase appetite as well. A solution for some people is just drinking coffee only with food, never alone.

Honestly I don't really know. This morning I drank some coffee when I woke up and 3 hours later I felt unusually hungry, not the typical empty stomach hungry, it was empty stomach hungry + low blood sugar feeling. I started drinking coffee again like a few days ago so it's possible my body isn't tolerant to the effect like it was when I started my diet. I'm thinking I should just quit, I think coffee or lack thereof isn't really affecting my actual hunger, it's just affecting my own sense of blood sugar.

*Overall the goal was met: Bumble bees came in to visit daily. Sat in old chairs and drank coffee in the cooler mornings. Outdoor cats like to lounge around the garden as well. We are at the edge of the town, and have deer and turkey that wander the street at thier convience. So far, no issues with them in the garden area.

The reason I‚Äôm limiting my question to this audience is because I only want people to answer who have truly tasted a high quality, perfectly roasted cup of pourover/drip coffee (no offense).

Here‚Äôs my question ‚Äî I feel like over the last few years, buying an $18-22 bag of 12 oz coffee beans from local roasters has been hit or miss and doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs worth the cost.  For those of you that know what I‚Äôm talking about, do you have any go to coffee beans that you swear are as good as (or even better) than what you can find in a bag from a local roaster like BlendIn, Amaya, Catalina, etc.? The closest I‚Äôve come is the Ethiopian Yirgacheffe from Addison Roasters which is in the bulk section at Central Market. Currently around $15.50/pound, which is the price point I‚Äôd like to stay at, as I‚Äôm having a hard time justifying paying $20 for a 12 oz bag of beans. I‚Äôve had some excellent batches from these local roasters, but more often than not they‚Äôre pretty comparable to $15.50/pound stuff I can pick up in Central Market bulk section.

I brew drip coffee and sometimes a Chemex pourover depending on how much time I have. Drink it black.

I went to his house last Sunday and he said he was going to make drinks blah blah, I get there and he was SUPER shy, which is fine but it had me worried thinking that maybe he didn't like me.
Anyway, long story short, we had sex twice and he was actually the first guy that ever made me reach an orgasm. 

I think the sex was great, we talked for hours and I stayed at his house until 5am even though he had work next day. But he didn't text me at all until I did 24hours later. We chatted for 2 days and I say it'd be great to see him again before he travels for Christmas and he just said 'Yes, it could be fun'... 

And I think it's important to share that before inviting me to his house he asked me to go have a coffee and watch a movie, but we ended up meeting at night because I was busy during the day. ",1,1734628731.0,ghosting,3,0.99,False

As the year is nearing the end, this guy sends an email 4 in the evening and asks everyone to join the town hall meeting at 5. Almost everyone working for my client are WFH and this 5-6.30 usually people take time for personal stuff like taking their kids for practice, spending time with spouse, grocery shopping, running errands. I use that time for gym and/or running errands. The previous VP was pretty chill about this stuff as all he cared was about results. He didn't look into petty things.

Despite the previous VP mentioning the break time, this new guy insisted that everyone be available for the Zoom meeting. So there were bunch of calls made to people to join the meeting. People were not pleased, including myself and my manager. This new guy asks everyone to to be available on camera and most people do that. I was on the camera, muted and was listening to the rant about productivity, results etc. I was also sipping my coffee.

Once the meeting ends, within 15 minutes I get messages from my manager saying that when on camera I shouldn't be eating(which I never do as it causes munching sound) and drinking stuff. Which I have been doing while on meeting with him too. 

The previous VP was pretty chill about that. During meetings I usually sip water from bottle or drink some beverage(not beer) like tea or coffee or sometimes protein shakes. I have been like this while working with clients too. The US guys, during Zoom meetings drink beverages and eat stuff too. Been doing this for a long time now.

From what I hear, the new VP found it disrespectful to him. Is his ego that fragile that an employee sipping coffee offends him? That might not be good manners but taking this as a thing and then cascading it all the way down to me seems to be a petty thing for a VP to do.

Before buying the 4 cup I had the 2 and felt like I had gotten the process down pretty well. This one is not going well at all. I have watched suggested videos and am following the exact same process, with horrible results. Here's what I'm doing:

180 ml hot water

Fill the coffee grounds almost full (about 2/3) and level the grounds, without tamping 

I have tried medium high, medium, medium low, AND low on my gas stove. 

As soon as the reservoir is nearly full I turn off the stove and remove the pot from the heat. 

Every time, there is NO ""crema"" and the coffee tastes burned and is very strong and thick. I am genuinely not sure what I'm doing wrong or what else to try since I'm following the exact steps recommended. I am using the recommended Bialetti Perfetto Moka coffee as well so it should be the right consistency.

1hhxg8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/PakistaniiConfessions/comments/1hhxg8d/the_coffee_compliment_i_totally_messed_up/,The Coffee Compliment I Totally Messed Up Responding To,"So, my office is in a co-working space where a few other teams also work. Every morning, as soon as I reach the office, I have this habit of making a cup of coffee. Then I usually step out for 1-2 cigarettes to properly wake myself up since I‚Äôm mostly sleep-deprived thanks to my own bad sleeping schedule. Without caffeine, I just can‚Äôt start my day.

Yesterday, when I went to the counter where we make coffee and tea, there was this girl already there making coffee for herself. She works in another office next to ours. I went into the kitchen, grabbed my cup, and took a tissue to dry it because I have this habit of not eating or drinking from freshly washed dishes unless they‚Äôre wiped dry.

As I came out of the kitchen, she suddenly said to me, **‚ÄúAap coffee bohot achhe tareeke se banate hain.‚Äù** I was like, what? It took me a second or two to process if she was really talking to me, so I hesitantly replied, **‚ÄúKaun, main?‚Äù** She smiled and said, **‚ÄúJi haan, aap. Aap jis tarah se coffee banate hain, lagta hai jaise lazzat ka pura khayal rakha jata hai.‚Äù** She said something else after that, but I don‚Äôt remember her exact words.

Now here‚Äôs where I really messed up. While she was saying all this, I barely looked at her and just grabbed the coffee jar. All I could manage to say was, ‚ÄúYeh meri purani aadat hai. Mujhse geelay bartanon mein na kuch khaya jata hai, na hi peeya jata hai.‚Äù

After I said that, there was this brief silence. I kept focusing on making my coffee, and she went back to making hers. It felt like neither of us knew what else to say since by that time I had already blew up the conversation. Eventually, once she was done making her coffee, she just picked up her cup and left with her friend. Meanwhile, I finished making mine and headed outside to smoke.

While I was outside, sipping my coffee and smoking, I finally woke up properly. That‚Äôs when it hit me‚Äîwhat the actual heck did I just do? Someone gave me a compliment, and not only did I respond like an idiot, I didn‚Äôt even say thank you! Matlab, it‚Äôs so rare to receive such compliements, and I couldn‚Äôt even show basic manners?

I felt super embarrassed thinking about it later. I mean, she must‚Äôve felt awkward too, like how rude I must‚Äôve seemed. I made up my mind that if I saw her again today, I‚Äôd apologize for my dumb response and at least thank her properly for the compliment.

But unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt get a chance to talk to her today. I saw her a couple of times with her friends, but it wasn‚Äôt the right moment to approach her and say anything. Now I‚Äôm thinking about Monday‚Äîif I see her, should I go up to her and say all this? Or would it just be weird to bring it up next week out of nowhere?",5,1734627644.0,PakistaniiConfessions,12,0.78,False

I've been noodling for a few years now. I have been thinking about my ideal end goal for my modular synth practice.

Have any of you had success doing this, or something similar? Have any of you tried and learned that it doesn't work? Any advice for how to approach a venue? ""Can I sit in the corner and make sounds that annoy your customers."" Doesn't seem like a great sales pitch...

\----> stop blaming capitalism for shit healthcare.   
  
Health insurance companies/hospital systems/big pharma in the US do not operate within a free market capitalist environment.  
  
They are deeply entrenched with the state. Their lobbyists use politicians to create laws that benefit them and protect them from competition.  
  
That's not capitalism, people lol. That's cronyism/statism. Two entirely different things.  
  
If you want examples of actual capitalism:  
\-- I make educational content and people voluntarily give me money in exchange for said content. If I charge too much, teach poorly, or do any number of other things poorly, my potential students will simply learn from someone else. That's why I have to be on point: competition.   
  
\-- My wife is a private lactation consultant. She helps people figure out breastfeeding issues and they voluntarily give her money for said help. If she charges too much, is mean to people, or her patient outcomes are abysmal, potential patients will hire someone else to do the job. That's why she has to be on point: competition.  
  
\-- That locally owned coffee shop around the corner? Yeah, there's a lot of competition from other locally owned coffee shops and large corporate coffee shops alike. If their coffee tastes like shit, they charge too much, etc.. they risk going out of business. Why? Competition.  
  
These scenarios represent capitalism. That's what you \*want\* as a consumer.  
  
The problem with the healthcare industry is that from the early 1900's, they became entrenched with the state. This idea that corporations hate regulations? No, the very top corporations love regulation. They lobby for it. [Read this short article](http://www.freenation.org/a/f12l3.html) to discover when, why, and how doctors nearly 100+ years ago colluded with the government to solve the first healthcare crisis (note: the crisis back then was that healthcare was too affordable!)  
  
Regulation protects these corporations from would-be competitors. To compete with them requires funding and resources that few have. So, you're essentially left with what we have: an oligopoly (a market structure where a small number of companies control the production and sale of a product or service).  
  
Therefore, the solution is less government, less red tape, fewer politicians. Lower the barrier to entry and allow actual competition to thrive. If you do this, healthcare will not only become affordable to the most poor, but it will improve in every other aspect including innovation, quality, support, etc.",29,1734627383.0,Libertarian,6,0.8,False

The drive from PA to London, ON was about 550 miles (885 km). Left the house at 100% charge, and stopped a total of 4 times, with the last one being optional so I didn't have to slow charge without time to precondition this morning.

First stop: Scranton, PA (~35% battery)
Second stop: Syracuse, NY (~30% battery)
Third stop: Niagara Falls, NY (~10% battery)

All 3 stops were EA, and battery preconditioning kicked in for them as well. It did turn off at 20% battery, which could have been ideal temp, but seemed like it happened due to reaching 20%. I did have to cancel my navigation route twice and manually route tona different charger. Syracuse stop was initially EA but owned by EVolveNY, so it wouldn't have been free. Stop in Niagara Falls said it was taking me to EA, but it would up being a Chevrolet dealer 7 miles away, and there wasn't even a single charger there! Used the POI option to get to Fashion Outlets for the last US charge.

Final stop was in Brantford, ON, at a Tim Horton's which had a 100kW charger (Ivy). Had to create an account before it would let me charge (fun at 0C/32F while snowing). Battery conditioning used again, going from 55% to 90% while we warmed up with coffee and a small snack masquerading as dinner.

So, other than the factory navigation taking me to an unexpected station once, and a non-existent station after that, the process was smooth and mostly painless. Longest wait was about 25 minutes in Scranton. One charger was out of order, an OG IONIQ was charging to 100%, as were a VW and Mini. The VW driver did kind of irritate me that they waited until 80% to even get out of their car and go get food at the Sheetz. They unplugged after they are at 97%. Guess my pacing around my car finally had them look up from their phones and realize there was a line of cars waiting. I charged to 95% because the line was gone by the time I hit 80%, plus I didn't know what to expect with respect to range in freezing temps.

Unrelated to being an EV, but I did lose cruise control twice due to snow buildup on front sensors. Honestly, I preferred manual control with how some of the other drivers were behaving in the conditions.",8,1734627217.0,Ioniq5,2,0.9,False

Hey a call out to those new to the area, someone looking for new friends or has a partner/relative/friend who might benefit.

Beverley Round Table is an events based club for 18-45 year old men. We meet up every couple of weeks for an amazing event.

Some highlights of the year have been forging our own Bushcraft knives, private tour of RAF Fylingdales the early warning ballistic missile base, with mead tours, coffee tasting and vinyl car wrapping to boot.

Whenever we meet there's always something special planned. In addition to events we also raise funds for charity and the community.

If this is something you like the sound of, or have someone in mind please check out:

Which links to our social pages and contact methods.

From my personal experience and other recent members who have joined. It's been amazing for making friends for life and doing stuff I wouldn't normally do.

""Do More"" as Round Table says, you won't regret it.

I am not a coffee drinker but my wife is who is from Europe along with our son.  This year for Christmas I wanted to get her a really nice super automatic system.  I did a lot of research online and it seems like DeLonghi and Jura are the two main brands everyone talks about.  I purchased a DeLonghi Dinamica Plus based on reviews which I haven‚Äôt opened or wrapped yet.  I was doing some follow up research and saw the DeLonghi Eletta Explore model.  It started making me rethink my decision and if I should have spent the extra money on this model instead.

Our local Williams Sonoma store had both models in stock so I went in and talked to them to get some advice.  We talked about both machines but she kept steering me towards the Jura brand.  She basically told me it was so much better of a brand as far as quality, durability and astetics.  They claimed these machines never get returned and they have customers who had had their machines for 8+ years still waiting for them to break so they can get a new one.  I looked at all their models and the Jura E8 is apparently the most popular selling machine.  It also carries a price tag of $1,000 more than the DeLonghi machine.  She was so convincing that I bought the E8 today and brought it home and wrapped it.

Did I make a mistake or is the Jura E8 a better overall machine she will be happier with?",2,1734626943.0,superautomatic,1,1.0,False

# Scooter‚Äôs Coffee Frisco Bowl | #25 Memphis @ West Virginia

*Tuesday, 12/17*¬†|¬†*9:00 PM ET*¬†|¬†*ESPN*

# #25 Memphis

# Mario Anderson Jr. | #2 | RB | 2025 | 5‚Äô9‚Äù | 208 lbs.

Mario Anderson Jr. is the engine that drives the Memphis offense. The Senior RB has unquestionably had the best season of his collegiate career in 2024. Anderson has turned 219 carries into 1,292 rushing yards and 17 TDs! He has also been an extremely productive pass catcher chipping in 46 catches for 290 yards and another 2 TDs. He is a short compact RB that is fun to watch. Unfortunately for him, he will be part of an extremely deep RB class. This doesn‚Äôt mean that he couldn‚Äôt be a nice late addition to an NFL team.

# Art Of Sport LA Bowl | California @ UNLV

*Wednesday, 12/18*¬†|¬†*8:00 PM ET*¬†|¬†*ABC*

# California

# Jaivian Thomas | #25 | RB | 2026 | 5‚Äô10‚Äù | 190 lbs.

When watching these bowl games, there are players you want to track as they approach the 2025 NFL Draft. There are other players you want to monitor moving forward in the college ranks. Jaivian Thomas falls in the latter category. The diminutive speedster has made some really nice plays for the Golden Bears this year. Despite being chained down in a committee, he has stood out as a player to watch moving forward. He can take the ball to the house on any given play.

# UNLV

# Ricky White III | #1 | WR | 2025 | 6‚Äô1‚Äù | 190 lbs.

In a class that is thin at the WR position, Ricky White III could see his name rising up draft boards as the draft process moves forward. Long and lean, White has put up back-to-back 1,000 seasons in the Mountain West Conference. White has the looks of a versatile playmaker at the next level. He is capable of playing on the outside as well as in the slot, giving him a real chance to hear his name called early on Day 3 of the 2025 NFL Draft.

# Union Home Mortgage Gasparilla Bowl | Florida @ Tulane

*Friday, 12/20 | 3:30 PM ET | ESPN*

# Florida | NFL Draft Prospects

# Elijhah Badger | #6 | WR | 2025 | 6‚Äô1‚Äù | 192 lbs.

Florida‚Äôs Elijah Badger is one of the most explosive athletes in the SEC. The Arizona State transfer has averaged an insane 21.3 yards per catch. He has never put together a big statistical season, but his speed and play-making ability could ingratiate him to an NFL staff this coming spring. He is yet another player that could benefit from a thin WR class. If he tests well this spring, which I anticipate he will, he could hear his name called relatively early on Day 3 of the 2025 NFL Draft.

# Tulane | NFL Draft Prospects

# Mario Williams | #4 | WR | 2025 | 5‚Äô9‚Äù | 178 lbs.

Mario Williams is one of the most well-traveled players in the entire nation. The Top WR for the Tulane Green Wave also spent seasons at Oklahoma and USC prior to this final go-around in the AAC. Williams is lightning-quick and specializes in creating separation at the line of scrimmage. His size will limit him at the next level, but he certainly has the quicks to start in the slot at the next level. If he lands in the right situation, he could absolutely be dynasty relevant. I expect Day 3 draft capital.

# College Football Playoff 1st Round | #10 Indiana @ #7 Notre Dame

*Friday, 12/20 | 8:00 PM ET | ABC/ESPN*

# #10 Indiana | NFL Draft Prospects

# Elijah Sarratt | #13 | WR | 2026 | 6‚Äô2‚Äù | 209 lbs.

Elijah Sarratt is the best weapon on the Hoosiers offense. The 6‚Äô2‚Äù junior has been a protege of Indiana coach Curt Cignetti going back to their days together at James Madison. Sarratt has been mum on if he will declare for the 2025 NFL Draft. He is a route-running specialist who gets open with technique as opposed to raw speed and athleticism. Despite that, he has averaged an impressive 18.2 yards per catch. When a player gets the nickname of ‚ÄúThe Waffle House‚Äù because of his ability to get open, you know you should pay attention. If he does decide to come out this year, I would expect early Day 3 draft capital and an upside of Jakobi Meyers.

# #7 Notre Dame | NFL Draft Prospects

# Mitchell Evans | #88 | TE | 2025 | 6‚Äô5‚Äù | 260 lbs.

The 2025 TE class looks like one of the better groups in the past several years. Notre Dame senior Mitchell Evans fits right in with this group. The ‚ÄúBig Y‚Äù TE has the ability to makes plays as a blocker and receiver, which should help him transition smoothly to the next level. His numbers are a little bit down in 2024, but he has still flashed NFL upside nonetheless. Evans‚Äô productivity at the next level will heavily depend on the landing spot, but he has the ability to be a TE2 for fantasy in the right system. Expect to hear his name called off sometime during Day 3 of the upcoming 2025 NFL Draft.

# Jeremiyah Love | #4 | RB | 2026 | 6‚Äô0‚Äù | 206 lbs.

Over the course of the 2024 college football season, Notre Dame underclassman Jeremiyah Love has established himself as the lead back for the Fighting Irish. The former¬†[4-star recruit](https://247sports.com/player/jeremiyah-love-46117330/)¬†has been a big play waiting to happen for the Irish. He boasts an impressive 7.1 YPC to go along with 15 TDs. Love is also a capable weapon in the passing game where he has turned 22 catches into 206 yards and 2 TDs. Keep an eye on him in this game and file him away as a name to pay attention to for the 2026 running back draft class.

# College Football Playoff 1st Round | #11 SMU @ #6 Penn State

*Saturday, 12/21 | 12:00 PM ET | TNT*

# #11 SMU | NFL Draft Prospects

# Brashard Smith | #1 | RB | 2025 | 5‚Äô10‚Äù | 196 lbs.

The second leading rusher in the ACC, Brashard Smith has put together a wonderful final year at SMU. The senior RB has been the focal point of an offense that took the Mustangs back to prominence and a spot in the ACC Championship game and¬†[College Football Playoff](https://www.dynastynerds.com/the-2024-25-college-football-playoff-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-12-team-format/). He is a dynamic playmaker with the ball in his hands, succeeding as both a runner and receiver. Despite his wonderful season, he finds himself in a crowded RB group within the 2025 NFL Draft class. He will likely have to wait until Day 3 of the draft to hear his name. But, he could be a great stash for your dynasty squads depending upon his landing spot.

# #6 Penn State | NFL Draft Prospects

# Tyler Warren | #44 | TE | 2025 | 6‚Äô6‚Äù | 257 lbs.

Tyler Warren is my top TE in the 2025 class. The 2024 Mackey Award winner set Penn State and Big-10 records alike during his historic season. The 88 catches for 1,062 yards and 6 TDs only tell part of his story. Warren has also been a dynamic runner for the Nittany Lions, carrying the ball 23 times for 191 yards and 4 TDs and has also thrown a TD! Warren has everything an NFL franchise could want and will be drafted in the first two rounds of the NFL Draft this spring. He is the closest thing to Brock Bowers in this class. He has TE1 potential and will be an absolute asset for your dynasty squads.

# Nicholas Singleton | #10 | RB | 2025 | 6‚Äô0‚Äù | 227 lbs.

Nicholas Singleton is a hard player to evaluate. The dynamic runner was the top RB in his high school recruiting class¬†[according to to 247sports](https://247sports.com/season/2022-football/RecruitRankings/?InstitutionGroup=HighSchool&PositionGroup=BACK). Singleton had an amazing freshman year before dropping off over the past couple of years. However, despite his drop in production, he continues to flash immense potential and is an absolute workout warrior in the gym. Singleton has run in tandem with Kaytron Allen, meaning there is little wear and tear on his body. Singleton‚Äôs testing numbers at PSU have consistently been just behind the numbers Saquon Barkley put up at Penn State. I expect Singleton to destroy the NFL combine this coming spring and secure a Day 2 draft slot this year.

# Kaytron Allen | #13 | RB | 2025 | 5‚Äô11‚Äù | 229 lbs.

Kaytron Allen has been the Robin to Nicholas Singleton‚Äôs Batman. He has been a battering ram of a runner, putting up over 800 rushing yards each year. He has never had that monster campaign working in tandem with Singleton but he has absolutely displayed NFL chops. While I don‚Äôt believe the odds of Singleton returning to Penn State are good, there is a much better chance that in a deep RB class Kaytron Allen will return for his senior season and enter the league next year in a weaker RB class. Right now, he has Day 3 draft potential and could be a nice stash player for your dynasty squads.

# Drew Allar | #15 | QB | 2026 | 6‚Äô5‚Äù | 238 lbs.

Drew Allar has been somewhat of a late riser over the 2024 season. The former¬†[No. 1 pro-style QB in his recruiting class](https://247sports.com/season/2022-football/RecruitRankings/?InstitutionGroup=HighSchool&PositionGroup=QB)¬†has been an extremely cautious signal caller during his time in Happy Valley. He has thrown only 9 INTs over his three-year starting tenure. This QB offers a huge frame with an elite arm to match. He is mobile for his size, but will never be confused with Josh Allen or Lamar Jackson. He recently announced that he would be returning to for his senior year and has a chance to be a top-end QB in next year‚Äôs class.

# College Football Playoff 1st Round | #12 Clemson @ #5 Texas

*Saturday,¬†12/21 | 4 PM ET | TNT*

# #12 Clemson | NFL Draft Prospects

# Phil Mafah | #7 | RB | 2025 | 6‚Äô1‚Äù | 230 lbs.

Clemson‚Äôs senior RB Phil Mafah is another old-school type of player. He is a workhorse back who can handle a ton of carries and punish defenders with his size. He has steadily gotten better each season at Clemson. Mafah is somewhat of a one-dimensional runner as he hasn‚Äôt been used extensively in the passing game. Despite his limited work in that department, he could easily carve out a niche in the NFL as the power half of a thunder-and-lightning combo for an NFL team. He is a Day 3 prospect.

# Cade Klubnik | #2 | QB | 2025 | 6‚Äô2‚Äù | 210 lbs.

Cade Klubnik is a somewhat divisive prospect. Many had him tabbed as one of the top signal callers in the nation but a slow start to the year saw his draft prospects take a hit. Despite his early season struggles, Klubnik managed to course-correct and lead Clemson to an ACC Championship. He is an athletic playmaker who is as adept at using his legs as he is with his arm. Klubnik accounted for 3,303 passing yards and 458 rushing yards with a total of 40 TDs! He will be an interesting prospect if he chooses to enter the 2025 NFL Draft and could hear his name called on Day 2.

# Jake Briningstool | #9 | TE | 2025 | 6‚Äô6‚Äù | 240 lbs.

The athletic ‚Äúmove‚Äù TE for the Clemson Tigers has shown steady development throughout his career. He is a bit undersized at only 240 pounds but has a frame that could add some bulk to it with an NFL strength and conditioning regiment. He has put up over 400 receiving yards each of the past two seasons and is a Day 3 prospect who could make some noise at the next level if he finds himself in the right spot.

# #5 Texas | NFL Draft Prospects

# Quinn Ewers | #3 | QB | 2025 | 6‚Äô2‚Äù | 210 lbs.

Quinn Ewers is yet another divisive QB prospect in the potential 2025 NFL Draft class. The Longhorns QB has managed to hold off all-world prospect Arch Manning for the last two years. Truth be told, Ewers has one of the best arms in all of college football. There have been rumors swirling around the college landscape that Ewers could decide to return to the classroom for one final season. That may be good for his final draft stock, but only time will tell if he heads to the pros or not. If he does decide to come out, he will likely fall somewhere between the end of Day 2 and the early portion of Day 3.

# Isaiah Bond | #7 | WR | 2025 | 5‚Äô11‚Äù | 180 lbs.

Isaiah Bond might just be the fastest player in all of college football. The undersized speedster will unquestionably light the track on fire at the NFL Combine this coming spring. However, he is still an unfinished product who may be more valuable as a coverage-clearer at the NFL level. Despite his immense talent, Bond has failed to put up gaudy numbers, maxing out at 668 yards in a single season. While there is certainly room for improvement, Bond will ultimately hear his name called before the end of Day 2 of the upcoming draft. He has rare speed and there will be at least one if not multiple teams looking to add that type of player to their roster.

# Gunnar Helm | #85 | TE | 2025 | 6‚Äô5‚Äù | 250 lbs.

Gunnar Helm is yet another elite TE prospect in the 2025 draft class. The 6‚Äô5‚Äù Helm offers excellent size and athleticism for the position. He has gotten better each season leading up to his 2024 breakout where he has put up 49 catches for 611 yards and 5 TDs. He is a smooth runner with an excellent pair of hands. Helm has all the talent to be an every-week NFL starter and will hear his name called before the end of Day 2. However, his eventual draft slot will depend on just how fast he tests in Indianapolis at the combine.

# College Football Playoff 1st Round | #9 Tennessee @ #8 Ohio State

*Saturday, 12/21 | 8:00 PM ET | ABC/ESPN*

# #9 Tennessee | NFL Draft Prospects

# Dylan Sampson | #6 | RB | 2025 | 5‚Äô11‚Äù | 205 lbs.

The leading rusher in the SEC, Dylan Sampson, is an electric player with the ball in his hands. His 256 carries for 1,485 and 22 TDs were easily career-bests across the board. He has been used sparingly as a receiver to this point of his career at Tennessee, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he cannot develop that part of his game. In fact, he could be a dynamic committee RB at the next level. I see him along the lines of James Cook-type player. Even in a class loaded at the RB position, I believe that Sampson has the talent to hear his name called on Day 2 of the 2025 NFL Draft.

# Dont‚Äôe Thornton Jr. | #1 | WR | 2025 | 6‚Äô5‚Äù | 214 lbs.

Tennessee WR Dont‚Äôe Thornton is a big play waiting to happen. The towering playmaker has averaged an absurd 25.9 yards per catch in his final season in Rocky Top, TN. Thornton has never managed to cobble together a full and productive season. I see something of a Martavis Bryant-style player when watching him play. Just like Bryant, it will all depend on who is throwing him the ball and what type of system he lands in. With how thin this WR class is, I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked to hear his name called sometime on Day 3 of the draft.

# #8 Ohio State | NFL Draft Prospects

# Quinshon Judkins | #1 | RB | 2025 | 6‚Äô0‚Äù | 219 lbs.

Quinshon Judkins is an old-school running back. He is a downhill bruiser who combines excellent speed and vision into a 219-pound frame. His numbers are down in 2024, but only because his transfer to Ohio State has landed him in a committee with TreVeyon Henderson. Despite not getting all the work, he has maintained his efficiency averaging a robust 5.5 YPC. While he has never been used as a true weapon in the passing game, I do believe Judkins offers a three-down skillset. He is a top-5 back in this deep class and will almost certainly hear his name called on Day 2 of the draft.

# TreVeyon Henderson | #32 | RB | 2025 | 5‚Äô10‚Äù | 208 lbs.

The original half of the Ohio State tandem, TreVeyon Henderson is a true weapon out of the backfield. His 7.0 YPC in 2024 is a career-best. These numbers suggest to me that he is best served working in tandem with a bruiser. He could fill a role like Jahmyr Gibbs does in Detroit. Just how high he goes in the NFL Draft will depend immensely on how fast he runs at the NFL Combine. Much like his running mate, Quinshon Judkins, I believe that Henderson will be selected on Day 2 of the 2025 NFL Draft. He will make an excellent dynasty asset for your squad.

# Emeka Egbuka | #2 | WR | 2025 | 6‚Äô1‚Äù | 205 lbs.

Emeka Egbuka has been a quality WR for his entire career at Ohio State. He has never been able to recapture the magic he had in 2022 when he put up a 74/1,151/10 stat line. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean he has disappeared from the Ohio State passing game. He is a nuanced route runner with plenty of speed to win against defenders. He has the talent to play on the outside or in the slot at the NFL level. When I watch him play, I get a lot of Terry McLaurin vibes. Despite his lack of consistent high-end production, he is a top-5 WR in this class and will get picked on Day 2 of the 2025 NFL Draft.¬†

I bought mine in black from Bloomingdale's about six months ago during my summer internship to act as a work bag, and currently use it as my school bag for university. I always have a large/heavier laptop, toiletry bag, and other general school things in the bag. 

Pros: 

* The bag has a great look and silhouette. I specifically got this style over the ever-popular nylon Le Pliage because I wanted something that kept its shape while in use. Unless I have it crammed with heavy textbooks, the City looks smooth and structured while on my shoulder. 
* The bag is very easy to clean. both inside and out. I've spilled coffee on the inside and was able to get it out easily, and the coated canvas exterior is super easy to wipe down.

Cons:

* The thin straps hurt pretty bad if I'm out and about all day. During my internship, I had to walk across campus multiple times a day and it kind of sucked. There's no weight distribution (obviously) so you bear all the weight on the one shoulder.
* The straps also fall quite frequently unless you keep your hand on the front of the bag, meaning going hands free is hard. 

In regards to the straps hurting/weight problem, this 100% a problem I brought on myself and can be avoided if you plan to use the bag to carry lighter items. However, it's not enough to make me switch back to a backpack and I still love carrying it. There is little to no wear besides some crease marks starting to appear from where the bag naturally slouches, which is OK with me. All in all, I am still in love with the City Tote and plan to resume using it as a work bag when I start my job.

Conductor on the pepper shaker alone doesn't do it, so the addition of the 3 Rejuvenator pieces were critical to making this work. Two limit-breaker mods and 26 Luck makes for a critical every other shot. The armor plus perks put me at 25 Luck and joining a team brings me to 27. So, is it good?

I wanted to share my recent experience exploring downtown San Diego and honestly, it's been incredible. I've lived in California for years but never really gave San Diego the attention it deserved until now.

Let me tell you - downtown San Diego is absolutely worth visiting. The Gaslamp Quarter alone is enough reason to go. It's this perfect mix of historic buildings and modern restaurants that just works. At night, the whole place comes alive with amazing energy.

I spent a few days wandering around and discovered so many cool spots. The waterfront is gorgeous - you can watch massive cruise ships dock while grabbing coffee at Seaport Village. And don't even get me started on the USS Midway Museum - it's mind-blowing to walk through an actual aircraft carrier!

One thing that really surprised me was how walkable everything is. You can easily go from Little Italy's amazing restaurants to the San Diego Bay in minutes. Speaking of food, the restaurant scene here is insane. From casual taco spots to fancy rooftop bars, there's something for everyone.

I actually found this awesome site that helped me plan my activities: https://athometouch.com/SanDiego. They've got tons of tours and things to do - definitely check it out if you're planning a trip.

Balboa Park isn't technically downtown but it's super close and absolutely worth visiting. The architecture is stunning, and there are like 17 different museums there. The San Diego Zoo is right there too - easily one of the best zoos in the world.

What I really love about downtown San Diego is how it feels both laid-back and exciting at the same time. You can start your day with a chill breakfast in Little Italy, catch some sun at the Embarcadero, explore some museums, and end with an amazing dinner in the Gaslamp Quarter.

For anyone thinking about visiting, I'd say plan at least 2-3 days just for downtown. There's honestly so much to do. If you want to make the most of your trip, check out https://athometouch.com/SanDiego - they've got some great tours that'll help you see all the best spots.

One tip: parking can be a bit tricky downtown, so consider staying at a hotel in the area and walking or using ride-sharing services. The weather is usually perfect for walking anyway!

Trust me, downtown San Diego is definitely worth your time. The mix of history, culture, food, and perfect weather makes it one of my favorite urban areas in California. You won't regret visiting!",1,1734625352.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

I have a son who is still an infant, and my husband and I have been together for a bit over 2 years. My sister in law and I don't get along, she's never been too fond of me but after some recent wedding drama she's just hated my husband (her brother) and I. At family gatherings she ignores me specifically and when I tried to reach out to schedule a coffee date to make amends, she told me she would get back to me and never did. 

So I just figured she hated me and moved on. However, she has shown a keen interest in our kids, and whenever we're at a family event (say a birthday party for one of the siblings) my MIL will take the baby to cuddle and then pass to my SIL who will cuddle and talk to him.

I've been debating over the past few weeks how to handle this. Internally it pisses me off that she can treat my husband and I like crap and still refuse to speak to me but will get to my son through her mother. But at the same time I don't want to drag our personal drama into my son's life. I dealt with this personally before with my grandma and mom and it was hard trying to pick sides, but eventually I sided with my mother. Also, if she has children that will be my son's only cousin, and I don't want to ruin that potential relationship either.

My question is, if you've been in this situation before how have you handled it? Everyone else is fine ish I guess but it's specifically the SIL that I have a problem with.

I have not just one, but two autoimmune diseases (recently diagnosed this summer). It's been so hard coming to terms with my diagnoses and the lifestyle changes needed to give my body the best fighting chance. Things got hard, I got stressed and depressed and turned to vaping after over a year of being vape free. I've been flaring up alot lately, not sticking to my diet and just overall not taking the best care of myself. 

This morning my vape ran out and on my way to grab some breakfast, i had pretty much convinced myself that this was such a bad time to quit (work stress, holiday season). I somehow convinced myself that I would use my week off work to taper down after buying a new one. The lies we tell ourselves. If I buy a new one, I'm right back where I started. I won't taper down, I'll use it continously. Somehow I surprised myself and regained the strength to not stop at the store. Instead I'm currently sitting at my favorite coffee shop, treating myself to a gluten free breakfast sandwich and an over priced white chocolate oat milk latte.

 I was willing to throw money towards a disgusted and debilitating habit, so I'm treating and fueling my body instead. I rarely ever have the courage to post anything but felt compelled to get this out there. I've been hiding my vaping from majority of the people in my life. 

The mental hurdle is no joke. I'm sure there's many more battles to come but for now, I'm counting this as a win. I need to get healthy. Mentally and physically and today is the start. Please wish me luck. ",6,1734625213.0,QuitVaping,6,1.0,False

The Porter Square Shopping Center is within a very popular living area and adjacent to one other city, Somerville which is the most densely populated in New England.

What all this means is that there's a 2-hour parking limit at the shopping center.

What happens when you exceed the limit? Yes, you get towed.

In the second video, one of the car owners, while in a coffee shop, is notified that his car is being towed and rushes outside. There's a bit of drama.

Before we left yesterday, she offered me this coffee drink she ordered from Amazon. I *love* my coffee, and never turn down an offer for coffee, so I accepted it. Well, I came in this morning, anxious to try it out. After each sip, I noticed that there were two distinct flavors: raspberry tea and oatmeal latte with brown sugar. I didn't really think of it until I finished the drink and *then* I read the label very carefully. 

Turns out, my tastebuds were right. It was black tea mixed with whole milk latte. In fact, the front label clearly said ""*MILK TEA LATTE*"". I know myself well enough. I like coffee and I like tea. But both of them together??? Yeah, not so much. In retrospect, had I paid more attention to the label to understand the ingredients from the drink, I would have turned it down. Sure, it's a tasty product but I know it's not for me. 

Well, I've often made that mistake in dating. I treat guys the same way I treated that drink: ""*It looks good and it meets my needs in the moment. Sure, I'll take it!*"" Well, just like I know I don't like coffee/tea mixed drinks, there are certain characteristics and types of guys that are not good for me. This is not an indictment against their looks, character, personality. Yes, there are good and decent guys out there that may appear to be what I want and desire. But after careful observation as to who they are, it may turn out that they're ultimately not for me. 

As I continue my healing journey and respect each opportunity the universe provides for me to get to know guys, I'm beginning to understand the value of ""reading the label"". It's healthy, appropriate and right for me to take my time in getting to know a guy, understanding how he thinks, seeing who he really is, and verifying if this guy can fit into my life *before* making the decision to pursue and intimate relationship with him. And if this guy is truly right for me, he's treating me the same way. When it's the right person at the right time, there is truly no need to rush!

So, moving forward, I'll be sure to take my time to ""read the label"" to make sure that he could be right. The right kind of guy will have no problem with that. ",1,1734624901.0,u_GalaxiGazer,0,1.0,False

I can't believe how easy it is to overlook things. I kept thinking, I'm sure my Wawa coffee is 15 or so calories, but then I looked at the creamer and it's 35 calories per tablespoon and I get a 24oz coffee! I know I put somewhere between 4 and 6 tablespoons in my morning coffee. 

There are sauces and cheeses, and butter added to foods. I've gotten better about eating things like almonds by the handful vs the bag, but I have bit hands! 

Taking a look at my calories has still been helpful, even if I'm bad at it. By seeing my menu laid out in front of me I can better pair foods together and know where I can easily cut when I next reach a plateau. ",5,1734624891.0,loseit,14,0.63,False
