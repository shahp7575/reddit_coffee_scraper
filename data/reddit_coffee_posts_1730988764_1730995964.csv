As someone who enjoys finding new coffee spots in the Philippines and beyond, I'm always coming across recommendations from blog posts, Instagram pics, or video reviews. But tracking down and organizing these spots turned my saved bookmarks into a jumbled mess.

That's why I developed Locator‚Äîan app designed to save and organize all those coffee shop recommendations with ease. Imagine you stumble upon a great article featuring must-visit caf√©s around Metro Manila. Instead of manually adding each caf√© to a map, you can just share the link with Locator, and it saves all the locations as geopoints for you.

Now, all your caf√© finds are in one neat place and ready for your next coffee adventure. If this sounds like a helpful tool to keep track of your coffee shop explorations, give it a go.

 Currently I start lessons asking students about their goals and usually have some Cambly slides or Engoo articles at the ready. At the end of the lesson, about 2 minutes out, I ask if they have any comments, questions or feedback.

 Usually with new students I send a follow up message saying that I hoped they enjoyed the lesson, and if so, to please rate me 5 stars as it makes a big difference. I ask them if they have any other questions or concerns as well.

 Is there anything else you‚Äôd recommend? Perhaps an intro message for new scheduled students? I sometimes feel uneasy investing to much free unpaid time into making materials or sending messages, but I‚Äôm open to trying new things as my once year long 4.98 had been gradually dropping to a now 4.81.

Usually my regulars reliably rate me highly but- it seems regular students rating either aren‚Äôt weighted as much or don‚Äôt count at all anymore  from my estimation.

 Is there any common red flags to avoid? Innocuous behaviours that may read poorly to a student (ie: I often drink coffee during my morning lessons)

# Welcome to your new Mod Free Origins SMP

We are are a Minecraft SMP Origins Server for 1.20-1.21 with custom tailored plugins that promotes a crossplay experience for both java and bedrock players without the need to install any mods. With heavy inspiration from the original Origins mod, we are inspired from the original mod  with additional new twist for the origins such as a Blazeborn's new heat gauge mechanic or Shulk capability to levitate enemies on hit.

We promote a friendly nontoxic environment and focus development to promote player to player interactions to create memorable experiences. We do not allow griefing, stealing, or harassment. We do offer a supporter rank for those wanting to show appreciation but only provide small QOL changes to avoid P2W advantages and to keep the server fair to all.

# Why Play Origins Reborn?

*Processing img w804v9xwyarc1...*

We offer a unique Towny experience via custom plugin integration to encourage both roleplay and teamwork within a low inflation player driven economy. Towns are encouraged to be a center point of activity for both town members and guests with new mechanics such as the Tavern and Market systems.

Enhance the vanilla experience with the famous Brewery Plugin with over 20 new drinks ranging from brews, coffees, teas, liquid orbs of origin, and more.  New coinvent recipes have been added to allow megabuild  projects to be more obtainable. We plan to continue to add more Quality of life changes over time.

*Processing img ai0w71gyyarc1...*

While PVP is not the primary focus of the server, players may join an optional PVP bounty system. The bounty system allows players to receive bounties and hunt others for monetary reward, but at the risk of losing some yourself.  Opted out players have defenses to discourage unwanted PVP.

*Processing img 80lgf26dxdcd1...*

We strive to have compatibility for as many players as possible. This means anyone can join even without mods, and allow players from Mobile, Console, Bedrock PC, and Java to play. We do not support cracked clients though, so you would need access to a Minecraft account

1gltxy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1gltxy6/what_30_days_of_game_dev_with_no_experience_looks/,What 30 days of Game Dev with no experience looks like.,"I know there are a lot of aspiring game devs out there that might be afraid to take that first step (that used to be me). This post my experience taking that first step into game dev.

It began with having some spare time together with a past passion for making games. What I first began with was to pick a game engine. I worked backwards from what I wanted to create and picked a game engine according to my game needs. I wanted to make a 2D tower defense game so I looked for an engine that would cover those needs. I tried GameMaker, Unity and Godot and picked Godot. It was open-source, no fees, suited my 2D needs, snappy and lightweight.

*PSA: For a better reading experience, I recommend reading* [*this same post I made over on the Godot subreddit* ](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1gltkxc/what_30_days_of_game_dev_looks_like/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)*where images and videos can be put inside of a post. Makes it so you don't need to click on Dropbox links!*

I spent some time imagining all the cool things I wanted to add to the game that I would write in my journal followed by adding it to the game ideas list. My mind constantly has new thoughts and ideas of what the game should be so having a document where I take the most refined thoughts and adding it to that makes it so that I off-load my mind with that thought. For me, thinking about the possibilities of the game is a way to procrastinate, which is why I just try to remove it from my mind as soon as possible.

[A document on Obsidian where I dump all my more refined thoughts about the tower defense game that I want to create.](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/89l49yijkiczjqfjinc1o/EarthScraper-Main-Vault-Obsidian-v1.7.5-2024-11-07-10-31-05.mp4?rlkey=9gno873p165b7ua2v64f5b2ei&dl=0)

Then I began looking up tutorials specifically for a Godot Tower Defense game. This is where I feel like my learning worked well, until it didn't. I was using¬†[this Tower Defense tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ-54sd-DMAJltIzTtZ6ZhC-9hkqYXyp6)¬†on Youtube and managed to get this far in following and massaging the tutorial to suit my needs. The issue however arose when I wanted to make something modular that wasn't a part of the tutorial.

Up to this point, I had minimal coding experience and knew next to nothing about the way one should code since I only followed tutorials and searched up problems when they arose. For days, I kept trying to brute force my way through things looking up more tutorials and finding code snippets that kinda suited my needs. This is how far I got with following tutorials.

[At this point I had clickable towers that could be placed on specific tiles, resource counter going up/down, range indicator, animated sprites.](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/qoj43ebiwxaoaocfmjt3n/EarthScraper-MVP-V0.1-DEBUG-2024-10-24-15-00-01.mp4?rlkey=fjqpkmxnsvy9bgi0e94u7szpj&dl=0)

I kept on taking small detours to Aesprite to make sprites. For me though, I realized that this was procrastinating. I was familiar with creating visuals and working with software like Photoshop and Illustrator made the side-quest of Aesprite a comfort thing to do... I quickly snapped out of that after creating some basic assets that I could then play around with and use before going too deep into massaging the sprites.

A big ahaaaa moment came from¬†[this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1g79ws7/learning_vector_math_makes_things_a_whole_lot/)¬†that talked about the importance of learning Vectors. I felt that it related a lot to me where I didn't really know why some things worked since I had just followed tutorials up to that point. So I dove in and learned about Vectors with the¬†[videos by Freya Holm√©r](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOYiVLEnhrw&ab_channel=FreyaHolm%C3%A9r). There were so many realizations that I got from that video series that really make your mind go ""dayummmm that's fascinating"". It game me a better understanding of how game engines think about space and how I should be thinking when creating... like really creating from scratch and not just copying a tutorial with slight tweaks.

[A small experimentation of linking two vectors in space](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4m6wjacv16xj20ea783at/Vector-realizations.mp4?rlkey=nt1vn0inw6aaikffpbogefqq0&dl=0) with a line, having the nodes rotate in respective to the mouse position were things I now understood how to implement after learning about Vectors.

After that I was on my way again and hit another snag with the tower defense tutorial. I then decided to ask Reddit a technical question that I couldn't solve and that led me to another ahaaa. Here is a¬†[link to that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1ggp3ur/how_to_put_a_variable_inside_a_singleton_call/)¬†and what I realized is that I need to take a step back from tutorials and really learn the fundamentals of coding, the bedrock of a game engine. It was my comments with¬†[/](https://www.reddit.com/r/macdonalchzbrgr//)¬†that made me reconsider the way I was approaching game dev.

Right now, I am nearly done¬†[this 8h C# tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGpSQsS8uc&t=21790s&ab_channel=CoffeeNCode)¬†and must say that my mind has had multiple Ahaaaaa moments throughout the learning process. Understanding the way the coding language works, the capabilities of it, how code looks, the methodology behind functions, variables types, loops and so on has given me new ways of thinking. Being able to now consider how I would create something from scratch is a massive jump from searching for tutorials that kinda suit my needs, which I then need to massage to fully fit my needs.

[A program that calculates the area of a triangle when you input the width and height.](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ag8mjmk8q56ig1aapqrv5/C__Users_Paul_source_repos_Learning_Learning_bin_Debug_Learning.exe-2024-11-07-09-59-36-Copy.mp4?rlkey=kxedcthgth0rrcnjv081usdpj&dl=0)

[The code.](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1napkekkt7p42wb1q71m3/2024-11-07-10_00_02-Window.jpg?rlkey=i8gfuffvf4edavqleu77z45iv&dl=0)

The cool thing is that I now can understand the code above, because I wrote it from scratch! With the code above, I made a function to prompt the user for two integers for width and height. I then made a function that calculates the area of the triangle with those inputs. Then I write out the answer for the user to see. It might not seem like a lot but understanding every part of the code now seems like a ""duh"" moment for me where it makes game dev easier if you can do so.

At this point, I am nearly done the C# tutorial and will jump back into Godot with a blank slate in a couple of days to then try and build my Tower from scratch. Let's see how that goes!

For some additional context about my learning journey, I have published a boardgame in the past and have a background in graphic design. So many issues that people might have with idea generation / graphics were hurdles that I didn't need to worry about when learning.

If I were to MiB my memory away and begin from scratch again, I would probably not change a thing. Trying out tutorials and hitting a massive wall was a motivational factor for me to learn about vectors and C#. I don't think I would have had the same motivation and eagerness to learn about vectors and coding without hitting that wall.

If you have come this far in the post, I would love for you to comment with something that made you go ahaaaaaa in your own game dev journey. Cheers!",0,1730995551.0,gamedev,0,0.25,False

Within a few days I think I'm free of my long standing ME/CFS symptoms, and all I did was cut out wheat, eggs and dairy. Coffee was cut a long time ago due to horrible reactions.

I was clearly having reactions to all of them - call it MCAS, whatever.

This was leaving me with aching limbs, crippling fatigue and episodes of breathlessness, severe brain fog, unable to walk around much etc without crashing for days/up to a week. I was severe bedbound after onset of LC for a month, then slowly was able to walk around the house and do basic chores.. but that's where I was stuck for 10 months until a few days ago, when it all changed essentially overnight.

The first noticeable thing to happen on day 1 was my limbs just stopped aching, which was really strange. Then I felt totally fine walking around outside, without having to walk like a snail.

I may not be totally cured (I'll try walking the kids to school shortly to see if I crash days afterward) but holy shit I just cannot believe this difference. I know I have other sensitivities, but I've found my main ones.

I believe I have turned an inflammation switch off that was trashing my entire system.

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-8181 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber with a reinforced lock, designated for low-risk anomalous objects. The chamber must be decorated with posters of ""Great Wizard Battles"" and ""14th Century Magic Schools"" to satisfy the delusions of SCP-8181-1 instances. Access to SCP- 8181 requires Level 2 clearance and written approval from Dr. Wizzleton (real name: Dr. Walter, but he insists).

Personnel handling SCP-8181 must wear gloves and protective headgear to avoid accidental activation. Under no circumstances should anyone place SCP-8181 on their head unless under controlled testing conditions. All instances of SCP-8181-1 must be administered Class-C amnestics following removal of SCP-8181 and monitored for a period of 48 hours or until they stop attempting to cast spells using household objects.

Description:

SCP-8181 is an ordinary orange traffic cone measuring approximately 0.5 meters in height, with a reflective white stripe around its midsection. Despite its mundane appearance, SCP-8181 exhibits potent reality-warping abilities when placed on a human head.

Upon donning SCP-8181, the individual (hereafter referred to as SCP-8181-1) instantly gains the belief that they are a powerful wizard known as ""The Old One,"" who hails from the 14th century. SCP-8181-1 will adopt an exaggerated medieval accent, claim to be over 700 years old, and refer to all nearby personnel as ""apprentices"" or ""squires."" SCP-8181-1 will also attempt to use ""magic"" by pointing at objects and yelling nonsensical incantations. These incantations are typically a mix of Shakespearean English, pop culture references, and gibberish (e.g., ""By the mighty staff of Gandalf, I command thee to fetch me a sandwich!"").

While SCP-8181 is worn, SCP-8181-1 can manifest minor reality-warping effects, such as turning office supplies into small animals, making coffee cups levitate, or causing brief, localized weather phenomena (e.g., a sudden rain shower in the break room). These effects are typically harmless but can be inconvenient and annoying. In one notable incident, SCP-8181-1 managed to summon a small, temporary moat filled with grape jelly around their containment chamber.

The reality-warping effects cease immediately when SCP-8181 is removed from SCP-8181-1's head. However, SCP-8181-1 will retain their delusional belief that they are ""The Old One"" for several hours, during which they may continue to attempt spellcasting with diminishing success. Over time, SCP-8181-1 will gradually return to their normal personality, though they may retain an inexplicable fondness for pointy hats and medieval fantasy novels.

Discovery Log 8181-A:

Date: 04/15/2024

Location: \[REDACTED\] Highway Construction Site, ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà County, USA

Summary:

SCP-8181 was initially discovered by accident during a routine road maintenance operation. The object was brought to the Foundation's attention after a series of increasingly bizarre reports emerged from the local highway department.

Incident Report:

On April 15th, 2024, at approximately 09:30 AM, road worker Jimmy ""J-Dawg"" Jenkins (henceforth referred to as J-01) was assigned to direct traffic at a construction zone on \[REDACTED\] Highway. During his break, J-01, for reasons known only to him and possibly a bet, placed one of the traffic cones on his head. Almost immediately, J-01 began shouting in a thick, exaggerated English accent, declaring himself to be ""The Old One, Conjurer of the Asphalt Realm.""

Witnesses reported that J-01 began attempting to ""cast spells"" at passing vehicles, resulting in a series of minor anomalies. These included cars suddenly swerving to avoid imaginary obstacles, a stop sign temporarily turning into a yield sign and a sudden, inexplicable outbreak of popcorn in a nearby vending machine. J-01 also successfully ""summoned"" a small flock of pigeons, which proceeded to congregate around him in an orderly manner, as if awaiting further instructions.

Concerned by his behavior, J-01's supervisor, C-03, approached him and attempted to remove the traffic cone from his head. However, J-01 resisted, claiming that ""only the Chosen One may remove the Sacred Hat."" After a brief struggle, C-03 managed to knock SCP-XXXX off J-01's head, at which point J-01 immediately ceased his magical activities but continued to insist that he was a wizard for the next several hours.

Local authorities were contacted after C-03 reported the incident to the highway department's safety officer, who, in turn, forwarded the case to the Foundation's front organization, the Department of Unusual Road Hazards (DURH).

Foundation Involvement:

A Mobile Task Force (MTF) was dispatched to the scene under the guise of an emergency road maintenance team. SCP-8181 was quickly identified as the source of the anomalies, and containment procedures were enacted. MTF agents managed to retrieve SCP-8181 without further incident, although one agent, Agent Thompson, briefly donned SCP-8181 ""for science."" This resulted in a 15-minute delay during which Agent Thompson insisted on performing a ""ritual"" involving a construction worker's lunchbox and a bag of gravel.

Agent Thompson was debriefed and administered Class-C amnestics following the incident. The lunchbox was later found to contain an anomalous sandwich that reportedly ""tasted like victory.""

Aftermath:

J-01 was questioned by Foundation personnel and given Class-C amnestics to erase his memories of the event. He was returned to his normal duties with no further incidents, although his coworkers reported that he developed a sudden and inexplicable interest in medieval history and wizard-themed video games.

All remaining traffic cones at the site were thoroughly inspected, but no additional anomalous properties were found. SCP-8181 was classified as Safe and transferred to Site-‚ñà‚ñà for further study.

Addendum 8181-1: Test Log

Test 8181-1-A:

Subject: D-9876

Procedure: D-9876 instructed to place SCP-8181 on their head.

Result: Subject immediately claimed to be ""The Old One, Supreme Sorcerer of the Realm."" Subject attempted to cast a ""spell of fire"" to light a candle but only succeeded in making the candle sprout a single leaf. Subject spent the next 15 minutes ranting about the ""treachery of the Dark Wizard Starbucks"" before SCP-8181 was removed. Subject continued to insist they were a wizard for the next 4 hours and attempted to transform a pencil into a ""mighty wand."" (The pencil broke.)

Test 8181-1-B:

Subject: D-4021

Procedure: D-4021 instructed to place SCP-8181 on their head.

Result: Subject immediately proclaimed themselves ""The Old One, Master of Thunderstorms."" Subject successfully caused a small thundercloud to form over their head, leading to minor water damage in the testing chamber. SCP-8181 was removed after subject attempted to summon a dragon by shouting ""Accio Dragon!"" (Result: No dragon appeared, but a nearby printer was briefly transformed into a toaster.)

Note from Dr. Wizzleton:

""I can‚Äôt believe I'm writing this, but we need to remind all personnel that SCP-8181 is not a toy. Yes, I know the 'wizard' thing is hilarious, but we've had three reports of reality shifts in the break room this week alone. Someone turned my lunch into a frog. Please, be careful.""

Final Note:

All personnel are encouraged to avoid using the phrase ""You shall not pass!"" around SCP-8181-1 instances, as it appears to provoke an aggressive response involving the hurling of nearby objects. This has led to several injuries and one highly irritated janitor.

Incident 8181-1-Delta:

Date: 08/22/2024

Summary: During routine cleaning, SCP-8181 was accidentally knocked over and landed on a Roomba, leading to the creation of SCP-8181-2, a sentient, magic-wielding Roomba. SCP-8181-2 attempted to clean the entire facility using a combination of broomsticks, mops, and what appeared to be animated dust bunnies. Containment was re-established after a short chase, and SCP-8181 was safely removed. No personnel were harmed, but several were left questioning their life choices.

Conclusion:

SCP-8181 is to be handled with caution. Additionally, all Roombas within Site-‚ñà‚ñà are now required to be securely stored when not in use.",0,1730995474.0,SCP,1,0.33,False

But sometimes the thought of ‚ú®coziness‚ú® tempts me. It has 4 times since September. Two out of four times, I‚Äôve been handed coffee with a bad lid or the lid askew and ended up with coffee all over my car. One of the remaining times, I noticed that the lid wasn‚Äôt on fully and was able to secure it before drinking it. The remaining time, they were out of grande hot cups and gave me a grande in a venti cup. No coffee was spilled that time. 

Is the secret:

- ordering a grande in a venti cup?

- bringing my own cup?

- avoiding the drive through so I can deeply examine the lid on the counter?

- ??

I‚Äôm not trying to blame anyone, unless y‚Äôall are being supplied with bad cups, but regular hot drink orderers have to have figured out how to have a lower failure rate than I‚Äôve had. ",1,1730995470.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

This trip is also to relax and have fun before I go back to school to finish my bachelor. I tried to help my grandparents and my mom as much as I can since I grew up with my grandparents till I was 14. For example, I buy some food, drinks, help cleaning, and prepare meal and such. I sometimes do complain when I was asked to brew coffee every morning ever since I came back or do cleaning but I still do it. 

But one thing I can't tolerate is traveling with my mom. Last time, I went to trip with her and my grandma, she walked back and forth for 6 hours along with standing in subway for couple hrs with little bit of resting and keep telling about how great the food is and how much she is paying and such (btw we went to only one place to eat during the whole trip). My grandma is old and has leg issue, so eventually I exploded and started yelling for her being inconsiderate to us. This is typical for her, so ever since then, decided to enjoy the remaining trip by myself while she also enjoys the remain by herself. Now, she's bitter and calling me an inconsiderate bitch for not prioritizing her nor following her to her trip locations. 
She is also mad that I am not showing her the souvenirs I bought for my cousin and sister nor clothes because i know that she will complain about not spending money on her and only spending on myself and others (btw I did buy foods and drinks for her although I don't work at this moment due to school while she's worning.)

Am I wrong to not be following her during trip and getting mad at her yelling at me calling inconsiderate bitch foe wanting to do my own thing? ",1,1730995416.0,amiwrong,0,1.0,False

1gltvsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1gltvsw/thoughts/,Thoughts ,"Married over 20 years.  Good sex life before kids but he had an addiction to porn. Got pregnant with the 1st and no issues.  By the time we tried for the second kid he had issues performing.  Had a third kid but I had trouble with painful sex during my pregnancy.  I know I didn‚Äôt initiate enough after kids and probably turned him down more than I should have but I was tired from working full time, being the full time parent, and the only one to get up with the kids.  I was touched out. 
We had some marriage issues.  Therapy a few times.  He still had performance issues.  We tried viagra I think once and it didn‚Äôt work. I didn‚Äôt realize how bad it was for him and thought something was wrong with me from having kids.  As in I couldn‚Äôt feel anything.  Now I know it was the ed issues. Still had the daily porn usage at this time.
Tried being intimate but more and more he couldn‚Äôt perform.  He would feel bad and I would feel like it was me because he was fine with porn so we didn‚Äôt really initiate for either of us.  It was great when it did work but it‚Äôs been years.  I asked him to go to the doctor and he said nah. 
I learned to take care of myself. 
He started isolating from me and our kids last year and would only go to eat or maybe for coffee.  Everything else was too much trouble or an inconvenience for him to do. He has always had an anger issue but I think this is related to his uncontrolled diabetes. 
I told him I couldn‚Äôt keep living like this and thought we needed space.  I told him I wanted to date him and wanted to work on it.  I think he was blind sided.  He says he agreed that we should be done but then says things like it wasn‚Äôt his idea and he is angry.  He says he hasn‚Äôt been happy in years. But I think his depression is rewriting his history. He had shut down.  
I see things on Reddit where he has posted he is never in the mood but that he wished he could add sex to his life. 
He moved out.  He finally started taking care of his medical issues and he says it‚Äôs for us. We tried being intimate twice and it failed.  I told him if he would communicate with me and we tried getting help and he couldn‚Äôt we could be ok.  I love him that much.  He kissed me like he hasn‚Äôt in years and said he enjoyed it.  Then he says days later I only tolerate it and could die fine without ever kissing anyone again. 
He does have severe depression and the uncontrolled diabetes.  He has now been diagnosed with sleep apnea, anemia, and low t.  Started treatment for all.  I am hopefully it will help him feel better and hopefully desire me again.  
I posted the other day about his social media addiction being out of control as well.
I am trying so hard to be patient but I hurt so much not having him at home with me.  He will only occasionally tell me he loves me because I think he is still angry. 
His actions tell me he wants to make it work, his words do sometimes too but he is really not communicating with me. 
I am trying to give him time like he requested but I just don‚Äôt know the best way to do that when all I want to do is talk to him and see him.  I am hurting so badly. 
Edit to add I worry he thinks I would be happy without the sex but I just need quality time without his phone and communication.  I think he also thought his depression was caused by me but I hope he sees even by himself he actually seems more depressed.",1,1730995399.0,DeadBedrooms,0,1.0,False

About 5 months ago they hired an older lady, let's call her Karen. Karen was all friendly with me, even offered me rides because she felt bad for me not driving. Meanwhile she wouldn't shut about her family and personal life. Karen is a 50-something year old lady from Oklahoma who looks 70 and drinks 3 energy drinks a day and snaps. Told me she used to be an addict. Only ass-kisses guests and management. We got a new boss, Karen has been ass-kissing him since day 1 and is definitely after him. 

Anyways, I liked Karen before. Until she backstabbed me. Made comments that we immigrants get free shit. Kept commenting on my foreign accent. Keeps calling every worker there younger looking but I look old somehow. I have been called by management and HR because of her over lies or exaggerations. Got a write up since she started crying playing victim that I am trying to hook her up to male coworkers, because they wouldn't talk to her. She thought I was talking about her. She reported me that I have a crush on our boss and I am talking about having sex with him. I was reported for being in pain after having a face filler and she wanted everyone in management to know and she said I made guests uncomfortable because of being in pain.

She has approached any coworker that I have a close relationship with, trying to be extra nice to them by making them food baskets from the food buffet or making them coffee and calling them names like dear, sweetie. The other day she got mad at me because x coworker refused her coffee and asked directly from me.

She always stays 1-2 hours after her shift ends to talk to HR and management like they are best friends since her life consists of nothing after. 

I dunno what she is gonna report after. I am so stressed. Like I work with 5 days a week and everyday she is capable of complaining about something. Management likes her sadly but I hope they don't believe all of her BS. The other day she told me she thinks she is the best employee because she comes at work 15 mins before her shift starts, without clocking in and working. I told her that's illegal and started getting mad.

So I (27M) met Mila (25F) like 4 years ago at a bar. Long story short, it was a mutual friend‚Äôs birthday, we were at this bar, and we had both just gotten out of long-term relationships. Hers was 5 years, mine was 4. A LOT of drinking later, it was hella awkward waking up naked on the birthday dude's couch with Mila. But honestly, that wasn‚Äôt even the wildest thing that happened that night. The birthday guy? He did something WAY worse.

Anyway, after all that, me and Mila were both super awkward about it. She legit looked like she wanted to crawl under a rock. Neither of us wanted anything serious since we had just broken up with our exes, but we still swapped numbers and went our separate ways.

Fast forward like 3 months, Mila texted me up asking to grab coffee. I thought it was kinda weird, but I figured she might wanna go on a date or something. When I got there, she looked like she‚Äôd been crying. As soon as I sat down, she just started bawling. Turns out, she was pregnant. She hadn‚Äôt realized cause she was super stressed and tired, but I was the only person she‚Äôd slept with. My whole life flipped upside down. We did a DNA test, and it was mine. Then she moved in with me cause she was sharing a room with a roommate. The guest room became hers, and my office is now Andreas room, but we call him Andy.

Having a kid wasn‚Äôt exactly in my plans, but since Andy came along, my life‚Äôs been better, honestly. Over the years, me and Mila never really had a romantic relationship, except for this one time she kissed me after Andy was born. We get along, I support them, I‚Äôm paying for Mila‚Äôs grad school (she finishes next year), we split the chores, and I‚Äôm always there for whatever she needs.

So, in November, Andy‚Äôs gonna turn 3. We‚Äôve been planning his birthday, it's around Halloween, so he and his friends are all gonna dress up. He wants to go as Bingo from Bluey. During one of our talks, Mila asked if I wanted her to move out. She said now that Andy‚Äôs 3, we could co-parent separately, and I could even, like, get a girlfriend if I wanted to. I just went blank and said ‚Äúno‚Äù and dipped to my room.

Here‚Äôs the thing: I love her. Having Andy is everything to me, but I‚Äôm also legit in love with her. She‚Äôs smart, beautiful, caring, thoughtful, kind, dedicated, she‚Äôs literally the most perfect person ever. But I‚Äôm way too scared to tell her. We have a kid together, and I‚Äôm terrified of ruining everything between us as parents and friends. I don‚Äôt know if I should tell her how I feel or just keep pretending everything‚Äôs fine so I don‚Äôt mess up what we have.

[I FINALLY TALKED TO HER ABOUT MY FELLINGS!](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1g21z2z/i_finally_talked_to_her_about_my_fellings/) \- 12 October 2024

So, I (27M) posted my story a few days ago, and yesterday I finally talked to Mila (25F).

Quick recap: me and Mila had a baby together after a one-night thing. Ever since, we‚Äôve been living together and I‚Äôm in love with her. She‚Äôs absolutely stunning, breathtaking even, but I‚Äôve been too scared to tell her how I feel because I didn‚Äôt want to mess up our co-parenting situation.

So, I left work early, picked up Andy from nursery, and dropped him off at my mom‚Äôs. I bought some flowers, cleaned up the house while she was in class, and texted her, saying she didn‚Äôt need to pick up Andy and to just come home because we needed to talk.

When she got home, she looked at me with her big eyes wide open, and the first thing she asked about was our kid. I hugged her for a while, but she went full mommy bear mode and kept asking about our baby boy. After I reassured her that he was with my mom and totally fine, she finally calmed down. I brought her to the living room, gave her the bouquet, and started talking.

It was a long convo. I told her how I‚Äôve been scared of ruining things and how it hurt when she asked if I wanted her to leave. She admitted she was afraid she was messing up my life, that she feels like a burden sometimes, and even blames herself for ""ruining"" my life with the pregnancy. I shut that down real quick. I never wanted kids, but honestly, since Andy and Mila came into my life, everything‚Äôs been way better. It‚Äôs been the best, most challenging ‚Äúmistake‚Äù I‚Äôve ever made.

She also said she likes me too, and she‚Äôs felt that way since she was pregnant but wasn‚Äôt sure if it was just the hormones. After the baby, she felt embarrassed to say anything because she didn‚Äôt feel comfortable in her body anymore. She never got back to her pre-pregnancy body and thought I wouldn‚Äôt find her attractive. But to me, she‚Äôs the most beautiful and hot woman on the planet. She also admitted she‚Äôd get jealous when I went on dates, even though she knew it didn‚Äôt make sense because we weren‚Äôt ""a thing."" Honestly, if she went on dates, I‚Äôd be dying of jealousy too.

We talked for a long time, even got into some deeper, more personal stuff.

By the time we were done, it was late. We went to this small restaurant near our place for dinner. No wine 'cause I was driving, but it was amazing. We chatted about music, movies, and she went off about ASOIAF for ages while I rambled on about LOTR. We talked about life and random stuff. At the end of the night, I got a few kisses in the car, like we didn‚Äôt even live together, which was kinda cute.

Then we watched a horror movie(awful movie btw), but she fell asleep cuddling me. It was a day full of wins.

1gltm1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1gltm1a/feel_like_giving_up_on_meds/,Feel like giving up on meds ,"Hi all. Diagnosed ADHD at 29 (now 31) and struggling to find meds that work for me. I've been on and off antidepressants since I was 16 - they don't do much for me at all. I'm currently taking 200mg of Lamictal (Lamotrigine) and 40mg Elvanse. I'm finding stimulant ADHD meds far too much for me. I was put on Ritalin first, then changed to Concerta and then finally Elvanse. All 3 stimulant meds gave me anxiety, heart palpitations, feelings of impending doom, paranoia etc. I once had a coffee after taking my meds and I needed to take the day off work I felt that bad. I'm wondering if anyone else has ever experienced similar - and if so did non stimulant ADHD meds work better for you? I've heard mixed opinions on the non stimulant meds. 

I have a diagnosis of ADHD, bipolar 1, BPD/EUPD, C-PTSD and currently awaiting my autism assessment. Not convinced I have bipolar 1 or BPD.

I really want to try and find ADHD meds that work for me, because I struggle so badly with lack of motivation, concentration, impulsivity etc and feel so envious of the women with ADHD who find meds that help with all of that. I'm starting to lose hope üòû

1gltkxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1gltkxc/what_30_days_of_game_dev_looks_like/,What 30 days of Game Dev looks like.,"I know there are a lot of aspiring game devs out there that might be afraid to take that first step (that used to be me). This post my experience taking that first step into game dev.

It began with having some spare time together with a past passion for making games. What I first began with was to pick a game engine. I worked backwards from what I wanted to create and picked a game engine according to my game needs. I wanted to make a 2D tower defense game so I looked for an engine that would cover those needs. I tried GameMaker, Unity and Godot and picked Godot. It was open-source, no fees, suited my 2D needs, snappy and lightweight. 

I spent some time imagining all the cool things I wanted to add to the game that I would write in my journal followed by adding it to the game ideas list. My mind constantly has new thoughts and ideas of what the game should be so having a document where I take the most refined thoughts and adding it to that makes it so that I off-load my mind with that thought. For me, thinking about the possibilities of the game is a way to procrastinate, which is why I just try to remove it from my mind as soon as possible.

[A document on Obsidian where I dump all my more refined thoughts about the tower defense game that I want to create.](https://reddit.com/link/1gltkxc/video/wjfmwci21izd1/player)

Then I began looking up tutorials specifically for a Godot Tower Defense game. This is where I feel like my learning worked well, until it didn't. I was using [this Tower Defense tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ-54sd-DMAJltIzTtZ6ZhC-9hkqYXyp6) on Youtube and managed to get this far in following and massaging the tutorial to suit my needs. The issue however arose when I wanted to make something modular that wasn't a part of the tutorial. 

Up to this point, I had minimal coding experience and knew next to nothing about the way one should code since I only followed tutorials and searched up problems when they arose. For days, I kept trying to brute force my way through things looking up more tutorials and finding code snippets that kinda suited my needs. This is how far I got with following tutorials.

[At this point I had clickable towers that could be placed on specific tiles, resource counter going up\/down, range indicator, animated sprites.](https://reddit.com/link/1gltkxc/video/4c8muj8fshzd1/player)

I kept on taking small detours to Aesprite to make sprites. For me though, I realized that this was procrastinating. I was familiar with creating visuals and working with software like Photoshop and Illustrator made the side-quest of Aesprite a comfort thing to do... I quickly snapped out of that after creating some basic assets that I could then play around with and use before going too deep into massaging the sprites.

https://reddit.com/link/1gltkxc/video/3ij3wb7t1izd1/player

A big ahaaaa moment came from [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1g79ws7/learning_vector_math_makes_things_a_whole_lot/) that talked about the importance of learning Vectors. I felt that it related a lot to me where I didn't really know why some things worked since I had just followed tutorials up to that point. So I dove in and learned about Vectors with the [videos by Freya Holm√©r](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOYiVLEnhrw&ab_channel=FreyaHolm%C3%A9r). There were so many realizations that I got from that video series that really make your mind go ""dayummmm that's fascinating"". It game me a better understanding of how game engines think about space and how I should be thinking when creating... like really creating from scratch and not just copying a tutorial with slight tweaks.

[A small experimentation of linking two vectors in space with a line, having the nodes rotate in respective to the mouse position were things I now understood how to implement after learning about Vectors.](https://reddit.com/link/1gltkxc/video/vsezgfuyshzd1/player)

After that I was on my way again and hit another snag with the tower defense tutorial. I then decided to ask Reddit a technical question that I couldn't solve and that led me to another ahaaa. Here is a [link to that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1ggp3ur/how_to_put_a_variable_inside_a_singleton_call/) and what I realized is that I need to take a step back from tutorials and really learn the fundamentals of coding, the bedrock of a game engine. It was my comments with r/macdonalchzbrgr/ that made me reconsider the way I was approaching game dev.

Right now, I am nearly done [this 8h C# tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGpSQsS8uc&t=21790s&ab_channel=CoffeeNCode) and must say that my mind has had multiple Ahaaaaa moments throughout the learning process. Understanding the way the coding language works, the capabilities of it, how code looks, the methodology behind functions, variables types, loops and so on has given me new ways of thinking. Being able to now consider how I would create something from scratch is a massive jump from searching for tutorials that kinda suit my needs, which I then need to massage to fully fit my needs.

[A program that calculates the area of a triangle when you input the width and height.](https://reddit.com/link/1gltkxc/video/bt4fszzxuhzd1/player)

[The code.](https://preview.redd.it/00o2bzh7vhzd1.jpg?width=1227&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff790ee465ffe3c2d26e9ad0135a8197f9926218)

The cool thing is that I now can understand the code above, because I wrote it from scratch! With the code above, I made a function to prompt the user for two integers for width and height. I then made a function that calculates the area of the triangle with those inputs. Then I write out the answer for the user to see. It might not seem like a lot but understanding every part of the code now seems like a ""duh"" moment for me where it makes game dev easier if you can do so.

At this point, I am nearly done the C# tutorial and will jump back into Godot with a blank slate in a couple of days to then try and build my Tower from scratch. Let's see how that goes!

For some additional context about my learning journey, I have published a boardgame in the past and have a background in graphic design. So many issues that people might have with idea generation / graphics were hurdles that I didn't need to worry about when learning.

If I were to MiB my memory away and begin from scratch again, I would probably not change a thing. Trying out tutorials and hitting a massive wall was a motivational factor for me to learn about vectors and C#. I don't think I would have had the same motivation and eagerness to learn about vectors and coding without hitting that wall.

If you have come this far in the post, I would love for you to comment with something that made you go ahaaaaaa in your own game dev journey. Cheers!",2,1730994672.0,godot,0,0.75,False

I realize this sounds silly to charge someone for a seat, but if you're a crafter you know you spend hours crafting to maybe only spend $7 on a coffee/tea/goodie.

I decided it was time to upgrade from my fork-mashing technique to something more... professional. So, I checked out the NutriBullet NBY-50100, and here's what happened.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

My first thought was, great, another thing to wash. 

But as I unpacked the surprisingly comprehensive set (we're talking storage containers, freezer trays, and enough lids to lose in the back of your cabinet), I started to feel like maybe, just maybe, this wasn't another impulse buy that that would end up in the garage sale pile next to my bread maker and that weird egg cooker I bought during my ""I'm going to meal prep"" phase.

The whole system looks deceptively simple ‚Äì like a regular NutriBullet that went through a baby-proofing makeover. It's got that clean, modern aesthetic that makes you feel like you've got your act together, even when there's pureed carrots in your hair and you're wearing yesterday's yoga pants. 

# My Favorite Features

**200-watt motor base:** This thing turns sweet potatoes into silk with the enthusiasm of a toddler destroying a clean room. It's powerful enough to handle most foods but won't wake the baby (unlike that time I tried using the regular blender during nap time ‚Äì rookie mistake).

**Storage system:** The date-ring lids are basically a gift to mom-brain. You can actually track when you made that mysterious green puree that might be peas but could also be that avocado you forgot about.  The lids are actually easy to open and close, even with one hand ‚Äì because whoever designed this clearly understood that growing a third arm isn't an option for most moms.

**Batch bowl capacity:** The 32-ounce bowl means you can make enough food to last several meals, or in my case, enough to cover the walls, floor, and somehow the ceiling. It's perfect for batch cooking when you actually have both hands free (so, never, ha!)

**Dishwasher-safe:** Everything but the motor base can go in the dishwasher, which honestly should have been the first bullet point on the box and printed in gold lettering. The parts come out actually clean too, not just ""dishwasher clean"" where you have to rewash everything by hand anyway. 

**BPA-free materials:** All the plastic components are BPA-free, which means one less thing to worry about.

# Real World Performance

Over the course of a month, I put this thing through its paces with everything from basic bananas to ""why did I think this was a good idea"" combinations. 

The only time it struggled was with raw carrots, but let's be honest ‚Äì who hasn't struggled with carrots? They're the overachievers of the vegetable world.

The batch bowl's capacity is great for making about 3-4 days' worth of food, assuming your little one doesn't suddenly decide that everything green is poison.

# Pros

* Genuinely simple to use, even with one hand while bouncing a baby and trying to keep the dog from eating socks
* Storage system is actually practical and well-thought-out
* Surprisingly quiet operation
* Quick cleanup thanks to dishwasher-safe parts 
* Compact enough to not monopolize precious counter space, unlike that bread maker I swore I'd use daily
* The recipe book actually includes things you might want to make

# Cons

* The 200-watt motor sometimes struggles with harder foods like raw carrots 
* Storage containers are on the smaller side (though maybe that's good portion control?)
* Price point feels a bit high for essentially a mini blender, but then again, so does everything baby-related
* You'll probably lose at least one lid within the first week

# Final Thoughts

It's for those of us who like the idea of homemade baby food but also value our sanity and time. Skip it if you're the type who already has a professional-grade food processor or if you're perfectly content with store-bought purees (no judgment here ‚Äì we're all just trying to survive). 

Also skip it if you're the type of parent who has their life so together that you can actually follow through with elaborate meal prep plans. (If that's you, please share your secrets.)

Is it worth it? If you're planning to make your own baby food regularly, yes. The convenience factor alone justifies the price ‚Äì especially when you factor in the storage system that actually helps you remember when you made that mysterious orange puree. 

Plus, there's something satisfying about knowing exactly what's going into your baby's food, even if what's going into yours is primarily coffee and whatever you can eat with one hand.

Basically since I bought it it has spilled a fair amount of coffee when I pour the first couple cups of a full pot.  Doesn't matter how careful or slow, it always spills some.  I have kind of just dealt with it but it has always annoyed me.  I recently bought a different coffee system through costco's website.  Was thinking of returning the Ninja coffee system, but wanted to get some opinions, would it be wrong to return a product that I used this long?  Does it make me look scummy?

So I (27M) met Mila (25F) like 4 years ago at a bar. Long story short, it was a mutual friend‚Äôs birthday, we were at this bar, and we had both just gotten out of long-term relationships. Hers was 5 years, mine was 4. A LOT of drinking later, it was hella awkward waking up naked on the birthday dude's couch with Mila. But honestly, that wasn‚Äôt even the wildest thing that happened that night. The birthday guy? He did something WAY worse.

Anyway, after all that, me and Mila were both super awkward about it. She legit looked like she wanted to crawl under a rock. Neither of us wanted anything serious since we had just broken up with our exes, but we still swapped numbers and went our separate ways.

Fast forward like 3 months, Mila texted me up asking to grab coffee. I thought it was kinda weird, but I figured she might wanna go on a date or something. When I got there, she looked like she‚Äôd been crying. As soon as I sat down, she just started bawling. Turns out, she was pregnant. She hadn‚Äôt realized cause she was super stressed and tired, but I was the only person she‚Äôd slept with. My whole life flipped upside down. We did a DNA test, and it was mine. Then she moved in with me cause she was sharing a room with a roommate. The guest room became hers, and my office is now Andreas room, but we call him Andy.

Having a kid wasn‚Äôt exactly in my plans, but since Andy came along, my life‚Äôs been better, honestly. Over the years, me and Mila never really had a romantic relationship, except for this one time she kissed me after Andy was born. We get along, I support them, I‚Äôm paying for Mila‚Äôs grad school (she finishes next year), we split the chores, and I‚Äôm always there for whatever she needs.

So, in November, Andy‚Äôs gonna turn 3. We‚Äôve been planning his birthday, it's around Halloween, so he and his friends are all gonna dress up. He wants to go as Bingo from Bluey. During one of our talks, Mila asked if I wanted her to move out. She said now that Andy‚Äôs 3, we could co-parent separately, and I could even, like, get a girlfriend if I wanted to. I just went blank and said ‚Äúno‚Äù and dipped to my room.

Here‚Äôs the thing: I love her. Having Andy is everything to me, but I‚Äôm also legit in love with her. She‚Äôs smart, beautiful, caring, thoughtful, kind, dedicated, she‚Äôs literally the most perfect person ever. But I‚Äôm way too scared to tell her. We have a kid together, and I‚Äôm terrified of ruining everything between us as parents and friends. I don‚Äôt know if I should tell her how I feel or just keep pretending everything‚Äôs fine so I don‚Äôt mess up what we have.

[I FINALLY TALKED TO HER ABOUT MY FELLINGS!](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1g21z2z/i_finally_talked_to_her_about_my_fellings/) \- 12 October 2024

So, I (27M) posted my story a few days ago, and yesterday I finally talked to Mila (25F).

Quick recap: me and Mila had a baby together after a one-night thing. Ever since, we‚Äôve been living together and I‚Äôm in love with her. She‚Äôs absolutely stunning, breathtaking even, but I‚Äôve been too scared to tell her how I feel because I didn‚Äôt want to mess up our co-parenting situation.

So, I left work early, picked up Andy from nursery, and dropped him off at my mom‚Äôs. I bought some flowers, cleaned up the house while she was in class, and texted her, saying she didn‚Äôt need to pick up Andy and to just come home because we needed to talk.

When she got home, she looked at me with her big eyes wide open, and the first thing she asked about was our kid. I hugged her for a while, but she went full mommy bear mode and kept asking about our baby boy. After I reassured her that he was with my mom and totally fine, she finally calmed down. I brought her to the living room, gave her the bouquet, and started talking.

It was a long convo. I told her how I‚Äôve been scared of ruining things and how it hurt when she asked if I wanted her to leave. She admitted she was afraid she was messing up my life, that she feels like a burden sometimes, and even blames herself for ""ruining"" my life with the pregnancy. I shut that down real quick. I never wanted kids, but honestly, since Andy and Mila came into my life, everything‚Äôs been way better. It‚Äôs been the best, most challenging ‚Äúmistake‚Äù I‚Äôve ever made.

She also said she likes me too, and she‚Äôs felt that way since she was pregnant but wasn‚Äôt sure if it was just the hormones. After the baby, she felt embarrassed to say anything because she didn‚Äôt feel comfortable in her body anymore. She never got back to her pre-pregnancy body and thought I wouldn‚Äôt find her attractive. But to me, she‚Äôs the most beautiful and hot woman on the planet. She also admitted she‚Äôd get jealous when I went on dates, even though she knew it didn‚Äôt make sense because we weren‚Äôt ""a thing."" Honestly, if she went on dates, I‚Äôd be dying of jealousy too.

We talked for a long time, even got into some deeper, more personal stuff.

By the time we were done, it was late. We went to this small restaurant near our place for dinner. No wine 'cause I was driving, but it was amazing. We chatted about music, movies, and she went off about ASOIAF for ages while I rambled on about LOTR. We talked about life and random stuff. At the end of the night, I got a few kisses in the car, like we didn‚Äôt even live together, which was kinda cute.

Then we watched a horror movie(awful movie btw), but she fell asleep cuddling me. It was a day full of wins.

I'm not hideous but I don't do well on the apps at all. I don't drink. Great job. Own a home. I work from home as well.

I've tried rec volleyball, I'm part of a running group, I go to an MMA gym as well. 

The rec sport I joined as a single and was put on a team of couples and others I had no interest in at all.

The running group is all established friends / friend groups who don't even look at me. I've only been a few times but man I feel really out of place. Usually we get coffee afterwards, and I hang around, have my coffee, wander around a bit but nobody acknowledges me. I feel *really* out of place lol.

The MMA gym, while I have talked with people a bit before classes and am friendly with a few people, everyone leaves immediately after class, and there's honestly not much down time to talk, music is blaring, can't hear anyone anyway. They don't often organize events outside of classes. There's like maybe 3 girls here anyway.

Meetup is dead in my area. I've thought of volunteering but it doesn't feel right to do it just to find someone, and I also feel like it's just going to be all old people.

I've thought of other things like a bowling league, axe throwing, bouldering, pickleball, tennis but I'm just so discouraged and overwhelmed about all of this. I feel like I'm flailing around desperately and *nothing* is working. I can't meet anyone let alone try and get a date.

I joke about wandering the earth and grocery stores like some fucking knight on a quest approaching randoms and asking them out, but that's honestly the last thing I see myself doing.

I want to work at this but I also kinda believe there's something to just forgetting about it, quitting, living life and seeing what happens.",1,1730993040.0,datingadviceformen,3,1.0,False

I have a long history of friends ghosting me and never giving me a reason why. I have a long history of being an emotional support buddy and not getting anything in return. Most ""friends"" need me to vent about their relationships and when they get a new boyfriend, they ghost. 

Making friends as an adult is harsh. Please note I said ""friends"", not meeting people. I have decent communication skills and can easily talk to new people. The problem is, none of them want anything more than an occasional chit chat or a 10 min conversation on the chat. When it comes to actually doing stuff together and supporting each other, they just disappear. 

I tried Bumble BFF (so far the biggest waste of time, I'm spending time entertaining people over a chat). Hiking. Nonformal classes. Nothing progresses into friendship, even though we communicate when we meet in that context. People want just a small talk of a few minutes. Not even grabbing a coffee together.

I don't even have concert buddies or a person I can go out with if I'd like to see a movie or go to a museum. I only have 1 friend that cares about me but she isn't interested in going out. I do most things alone.

1glsujo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1glsujo/coffee_triggers_in_general/,Coffee/ triggers in general,"Very recently diagnosed here, and have been in a flare for almost a year. I genuinely don't know what my triggers are yet.

I've given up alcohol, dairy (the only food I know FOR SURE that makes me sick), recently switched to low fiber foods, white meat instead of red. quit carbonated drinks entirely, etc. 

Now, I've been cutting out coffee/caffeine. Switching first to half-decaf and then to decaf. 

This is hard for me as caffeine has always been part of what I look forward to everyday as somebody who is sober with a tendency towards craving stimulation.. 

Is there any conclusion as to what about coffee/ caffeine is bad? Is it the acid in coffee or caffeine in general? I've read that some people have no issue with caffeine. Or better luck with tea, etc.

My symptoms are mostly perianal. The discomfort is constant, so it's very hard for me to have a certain food and then note that that, specifically, made me feel worse. Coffee specifically doesn't have any impact on my BMs, in fact if anything it seems to keep me regular. The only food I know with certainty effects my BMs are those containing milk/ lactose. Does anybody have experience with this? How were you able to start pinpointing triggers?

1glstu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1glstu9/no_dav_spoilers_an_honest_review_from_someone_who/,[No DAV Spoilers] An Honest Review From Someone Who Originally Had a Very Pessimistic Outlook On This Game:,"Alright folks, let's talk about this.

Now that the game has been out a week and the dust has settled, I feel I can finally give an honest opinion and review. Rather than doing pros and cons, I'll break it down by each aspect of the game that I feel needs to be addressed:

-Scenery/graphics/art style: 

Honestly, 80% of this is fantastic; and by fantastic, I mean FANTASTIC. Scenery is top notch. At first I was slightly turned off by the ""Pixar"" character design, but it really grows on you. Hair detail and physics? My lort it's the best I've ever seen in a video game. Enemy design, especially compared to previous titles however, is lame and too ""cartoon-y""

-Atmosphere: 

This doesn't feel like a DA game. The atmosphere is much more ""bubbly"" than previous DA games, which sort of works, but at the same time doesn't work. I really had to approach it like it wasn't a DA game to actually start enjoying it. For being rated M (or 18 depending on your country), 99% of this game feels VERY PG-13. The fact that several characters on multiple occasions kept calling me ""kid"" makes me feel like this game was meant for 13-17 year olds. It also doesn't have those ""dark"" elements/settings to the degree that previous DA games had or other games currently do have. This was disappointing to me.

-Combat: 

Flashy, ""fun"", and button-mashy. However, as you progress the game, I see why several reviewers turned down the difficulty; not because the game is hard, but good lord some of the enemies become damage sponges to the point where some fights get monotonous and dare I say boring while you wait for stuff to come off of cooldown (a main source of damage for the big bois). Lots of enemies are reskinned with the same moveset, and some will sit there for several seconds not doing anything.

-RPG elements: 

Very basic. It has SOME sense of being an RPG, but it feels like an RPG from 10-15 years ago. No color dyes for armor, a very basic skill tree, and (from at least a fighter class perspective) it really feels like only 2 weapons/armors in each category are even worth using. It DOES have an excellent character creator, however if you played the Monster Hunter Wilds beta, that character creator TRUMPS this one. 

-World immersion: 

Level designs are all very linear, don't feel ""real"" in their design, and everything is very ""video gamey"". In other words, once again, it's ""dated"". Seriously, green pots for healing potions sprawled throughout the game? That's something from 2005. 90% of the NPCs do absolutely nothing but stand there. They don't react to enemies around them or combat in the slightest. On the other end of the spectrum, there are several dialogue moments, like the infamous push up cutscene, that totally take you out of the game and make you feel like you're not in a medieval fantasy anymore and rather watching a corporate sensitivity training video.

-Story: 

The barebones of the story (from a standalone perspective) is actually very solid. I enjoyed the overall journey that the game took me on. HOWEVER, I felt that the game really didn't pick up or get to the really good bits until the final third, maybe even the final quarter of the game. It shouldn't take more than 20-30 hours of playtime (depending on how many side quests you went on) before you feel like you're getting pulled into the story. I can see why so many people out it down after 8-10 hours.

Writing: 

Now for the fun part. I'm FULLY convinced that there were two writing teams working on this game, and they did little to no communication with each other whatsoever and lived on different planets. The parts where the writing is good, it's GOOD. There are several moments where I actually said to myself ""ok this is pretty damn good"". Then, there are just as many moments where I went ""wow, this is just...bad"". I mean, it REALLY does feel like two different writing teams; that's how drastically different these moments feel. A good half of the dialogue is too ""safe""; there were no risks made in the depth of the writing, to the point where I'm fully convinced EA/Bioware were too self-conscious and didn't want to offend anyone. It's also very clear that the ""bad"" writing team knew next to nothing about the lore of DA/never played the previous titles, as this is very watered down and basic.

-Companions: 

Voice acting was the best it could be given the writing that they had. Several of the companions have LOTS of cringe worthy dialogue even for Bioware (albeit it's not as bad as some people say it is), and then some will have little cherry picked moments where they actually show depth and I really enjoyed them, but this is few and far between. Every character is very one-dimensional. I got tired of Lucanis constantly talking about coffee/cooking, or how Davrin felt like a 12 year old with his first puppy and had no common sense on how to raise it, or how Taash constantly acted like a bratty teenager with mommy issues. It's ok for this to be a PART of their personality, but when it's 80% of what they talk about/how they act, AND there's little to no growth in their development, that's just bad writing.

-Final thoughts:

If we HAVE to do a scale from 1-10, it gets a 6.8/10 for me. The good moments were GOOD, but the bad moments were BAD, and there was an equal share of each. This balance would suggest a 5/10, but the scenery, character creator, hair physics, and some overall sense of a good story bring it up a bit. If you're a fan of the DA series and you have plenty of disposable income, buy the game, otherwise I would wait until it goes on sale. I'd say I'm ""satisfied"" that I played, but don't see a reason to do another playthrough.",3,1730992720.0,dragonage,2,0.71,False

Background:
Last month, I replaced the burrs on my Eureka Mignon Specialita grinder. Since then, I‚Äôve put about 1.5kg of coffee through it. However, I‚Äôm now struggling to dial in consistently, which wasn‚Äôt an issue before.

Issue:
	‚Ä¢	Inconsistent Dosing: Yesterday, I pulled a perfect shot with 18g in, 36g out, in 30 seconds. But today, using the same settings, my grind clumped heavily and only weighed 14.3g.
	‚Ä¢	Dialing Problems: Even the smallest adjustments either do nothing or make a huge difference, resulting in an overly fine or overly coarse grind. It‚Äôs taking multiple attempts to get a drinkable shot.

Frustration:

1glspzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1glspzv/scam_call_claiming_to_be_from_amazon_initially/,"Scam call claiming to be from Amazon, initially claiming a suspicious purchase attempt on my account.","**I searched the sub and checked the Wiki, but didn't find anything that quite matched up.**

I received a call around 7:30AM US CST this morning from a [redacted bc unsure of rules, unrecognized] area code number in the US. 

Saw a 0:00 voicemail. I called the number back because I've been applying for jobs lately, so I do tend to return calls from unrecognized numbers in case it regards that.

The person on the other end claimed to be with Amazon, and proceeded to verify my name and how it was spelled.

Quick note, I had LITERALLY just woken up when I called back, and was getting coffee and stuff while I was talking to them. Had not yet taken my meds.

Basically, I feel I was slightly slower than usual in realizing it wasn't legit, lol!

Initially, they claimed that there was a suspicious purchase under my Amazon account -- specifically, per the caller, a $499 Apple MacBook of some kind.

Not entirely unbelievable, though I immediately had it in the back of my head that ""Ok yeah I should check the site or app here probably to make sure."" But, again, groggy and all that at the time.

I verified that yes, that wasn't me. (And also added that I literally do not even HAVE that amount on any card or account attached to my Amazon account as a payment method, none of which are credit cards. Should have probably tipped me off tbh lol.)

They then proceeded to ask about locations from which my Amazon account had allegedly been accessed. (I live in Florida.)

They listed New Jersey, Ohio, and Texas. I told them that I lived in Texas from June 2022 through September 2023, so that was only me if it were in that time frame, but that the other two definitely were not.

Then they started talking about money laundering fraud under my social security number. Yeeeeahhhh that was when I was like ""Oh okay this is DEFINITELY a phishing scam.""

At that point, I was like ""Okay, yeah, I'ma stop you there. Do you have a way you can verify for me that you actually work for Amazon? This kind of thing is a common scam.""

I ended up being like, ""Okay yeah I'm going to hang up now and contact Amazon directly, I'll call back if this turns out to be legit."" (Which it obviously was not.)

I reported it on Amazon's website, where they have a form you can fill out for this kind of thing.

**My guess is that the scammers probably got my name and phone number from some job application or another.**

Given that ghost jobs from actual companies are a thing, I wouldn't be surprised if fake but legitimate-looking listings for local retail jobs and similar could exist for phishing attempt purposes.

If that's the case, I figure I'm far from the only person right now looking for part time seasonal retail work locally for some extra cash, so I figured I'd share that there's a scam like this going around right now.

**I figure most Redditors are tech savvy enough not to be particularly vulnerable to something like this, but it might be something to pass on if you have any older relatives who are looking for part time seasonal temp work over the holidays for some extra cash.**",0,1730992434.0,Scams,4,0.5,False

Everyone in Miranda Sutton and Hansel Johnson's friend circle knew that she was head-over-heels in love with him.
She loved him so much that her entire life revolved around him. There was no such thing as personal space for her, and she would've preferred it if she could be with him 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Every time they broke up, she'd come crawling back to him, asking to get back together within three days or less. Anyone could initiate a breakup with their partner, but not Miranda. She'd never bring those two words up.
So, when Hansel brought his new girlfriend, Ingrid York, into the room, everyone fell eerily silent for five whole seconds.
Miranda stopped peeling the clementine in her hands. ""Why's everyone so quiet? And why are you all looking at me?""
Her friend looked at her in concern. ""Mimi‚Ä¶""
Hansel didn't seem to care about anything as he guided Ingrid all the way to an empty spot on the couch with a hand around her waist. ""Happy birthday, Cal.""
He behaved blatantly, as though he wasn't doing anything wrong.
Miranda got up from her seat. It was Calvin Campbell's birthday that day, and she didn't want to make things ugly.
""I'm going to the bathroom.""
As she closed the door behind her, she heard the people in the room start to talk.
""Hans! Didn't we tell you that Miranda was still here? Why did you still bring her here?""
""Exactly! You're going overboard this time, Hans!""
""It doesn't matter,"" Hansel said, finally removing his arm from Ingrid's waist. He then lit up a cigarette and started smoking.
There was a grin in his eyes as he puffed the cigarette smoke into the air, seeming like a playboy who loved fooling around with people just for the fun of it.
As for the rest of what he said, Miranda didn't hear it because the door had finally closed. She went into the bathroom and touched up her makeup. She couldn't help smiling pitifully at herself in the mirror.
""Hideous.""
She lived such a hideously pitiful life.
Miranda took a deep breath as she made her decision.
However, when she went back to the private room and saw what was going on inside, she tightened her grip on the door handle and nearly went back on her words.
Hansel's lips were firmly pressed against Ingrid's lips, their saliva thoroughly wetting the thin piece of tissue that was preventing them from properly kissing. Everyone around them was laughing hard.
""Oh, my god! Hans, you sure know how to rile things up!""
""They're kissing! They're actually kissing!""
""I mean, since everyone's so excited, you guys might as well just kiss!""
Miranda felt her hand shaking against the door handle.
This was the man she'd loved for six years. Now, she felt like nothing but a laughingstock.
""Guys, tone it down,"" someone suddenly whispered, gesturing at the door. Everyone immediately looked toward the entrance.
""M-Mimi? You're back. Err, we're all just fooling around, you see. Don't mind‚Äî""
""Miranda."" Hansel interrupted the person trying to explain the situation and just looked at Miranda with a calm expression on his face. ""Since you're here, let me straighten things out with you.""
""Okay. I'm listening.""
""It's tiring breaking up and making up with you for so many years. The feelings between us have long died.""
Miranda tightened her fist and dug her nails into her palm. However, it was as if she couldn't feel any pain at all.
They'd been dating for six years, but their relationship had ended with him saying his feelings were long gone.
""Ingy is a wonderful person, and I want to make things official with her.""
Miranda nodded robotically. ""Okay.""
""Even though we've broken up, we can still stay friends. You can still come to me if you run into any problems in Jandersville.""
""No thanks,"" Miranda said, forcing a smile on her face. It was a wan smile, but a smile nonetheless.
""Since we've broken up, it's better for us not to have any more contact with each other. That would only be fair to your new girlfriend.""
Hansel raised an eyebrow, looking a little shocked.
""Cal,"" Miranda said, turning to look at the main character of the birthday party. ""Happy birthday to you again.
""I hope you guys have a lot of fun tonight, but I'll be leaving now. Everyone, help yourselves to the plate of clementines I peeled on that table. Don't let it go to waste.""
Hansel hated every type of fruit except clementines. However, he was picky about it and would pick off every single vein on the fruit before eating it.
For the past years, Miranda had meticulously peeled and cleaned clementines just the way he liked them before presenting them to him. She did it because she wanted him to at least get the vitamins and nutrients he needed from fruits.
When Hansel was in a good mood, he'd hug her and say, ""My girlfriend is the best in the world. How could you be so good to me? Should I just marry you?""
He'd known what she'd wanted all along, but he'd never given it to her.
Hansel said, ""I'll get Dan to drive you home.""
""Don't worry about it. I've already called for a cab.""
Calvin said, ""Miranda, I'll see you to the door.""
Miranda declined gratefully, shaking her hands at him before turning to leave.
""Hans, look what you‚Ä¶ I think Miranda's really mad this time.""
""I don't think so.""
""Yeah, they've broken up so many times in the past, but Miranda always comes crawling back to him a few days later. She'll pretend nothing happened the next time we meet up again.""
""I'm betting she'll be back in five days this time.""
""Six days!""
Hansel looked at the door that wasn't shut properly and smiled coldly. ""I say she'll be back looking for me in three hours.""
""Okay, Hans wins. The whole world knows how crazy Miranda is for him.""
""Damn. Why aren't there any women crazy over me like her?""
""You? Fuck off, buddy!""
""Hahaha!""
‚Ä¶
It was past midnight by the time Miranda got back to the mansion. She took half an hour to pack up all her things.
She'd lived here for three years, but now that she was leaving, her belongings only fit in a tiny suitcase. She didn't take any of the designer clothing or luxurious jewelry she'd never even worn before.
The only thing she wanted to take with her but couldn't was the wall of technical reference books. Luckily, she'd memorized all of their contents. The physical books weren't that important anymore.
Her gaze swept over the dressing table. She then walked toward it and pulled open a drawer.
There was a check at the bottom of the drawer for 50 million dollars. There was also a pile of documents under the check. The title on the first page read, ""Land Title Transfer: Plot 3-5, No. 72, Easternia.""
Although the plot of land was in the suburbs, it was still worth about 20 million dollars.
Hansel had already signed both the check and the land transfer deed. He'd signed them the last time they'd broken up, and the documents had been in the drawer ever since then.
He was sure that Miranda would never dare to take those two documents away; if she took them, it meant that their relationship was over for good.
Suddenly, Miranda thought she'd managed to strike a bargain.
Exchanging six years of her life for 70 million dollars didn't seem like a bad deal after all. Not many women were lucky enough to get so much compensation for years and years of their youth.
She tucked the two documents away in her bag. There was no reason not to take them since he'd already given them to her.
Even if she was out of love, at the very least, she wasn't out of money.
She wasn't like those stupid women in those sappy romance books who thought money was nothing compared to love.
""Hello, is this the cleaning company? Do you take urgent orders? I want a spring clean, and I don't mind paying extra for it.""
Miranda then put the house keys in an agreed-upon hiding spot, piled her things into a cab, and set off for her best friend's condominium.
On the way, Miranda received another call from the cleaning company. ""Miss, are you sure that you don't want these things anymore?""
""I don't. You can do whatever you want with them,"" Miranda replied before hanging up.
‚Ä¶
By the time Hansel got back home, it was nearly the crack of dawn. The people from the cleaning company had long gone by then.
Hansel had a migraine from the strong perfume scent hanging around him. He tugged at his collar and decided to rest for a while on the couch. However, he ended up falling asleep.
When he woke up the next morning, he heard the familiar sound of pots and pans clinking in the kitchen.
He pulled the blanket away from his body, massaging his temples as he reached for the glass of water on the coffee table.
However, there was no glass or water on the table. Hansel froze for a second.
A while later, the corners of his lips lifted. Miranda was back anyway, and she'd even covered him with a blanket sometime through the night.
How dare she not prepare him his usual glass of water to wake him up from his hangover?
How long had she been playing mind games with him? Her rebellion wasn't even wholehearted anyway. Wasn't she sick of it?
Hansel chuckled as he got up. ""You'd better‚Äî""
""Mr. Johnson, are you up?""
""Martha?""
Martha Watson was Hansel's housekeeper. ""Breakfast will be ready in a few minutes, Mr. Johnson, so you can go and wash up in the meantime.
""Oh, it wasn't too cold for you at night, was it? I turned on the heater but thought you might still catch a cold, so I draped the blanket over your body.""
""Oh.""

Now my eyes look brownish and dull, and my boyfriend always tells me it‚Äôs that way because I have high amounts of melanin in me, but I know what they were before the job, and they were certainly not stained.

If they were reddish, I would be able to handle them, but they look downright dirty and dull, and no matter how well I dress, I always look tired because my eyes are not vibrant.

I don‚Äôt smoke or drink and I only drink coffee and Lipton tea.

1glsfsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParentsOfAddicts/comments/1glsfsf/mothers_tears/,Mother‚Äôs tears,"This morning I was enjoying my coffee and listening to a podcast where a young woman had met trouble while kayaking and was in grave danger. She had been on vacation with her mom and at some point wondered why her mom hadn‚Äôt come. She said she knew her mom to be someone who would always fight for her and she didn‚Äôt understand why she hadn‚Äôt been rescued. She knew she would probably die. When she eventually was rescued and was reunited with her mom, she learned that she had organized a massive rescue attempt. Volunteers combed the waters. She hired a helicopter and went up herself, scouring the landscape for her kid.  I found myself sobbing.. 

The thing about addiction is that we as parents don‚Äôt always know how to fight for our child. We don‚Äôt know what will work and sometimes the right action is a drastic one. Other times it is self care. There have been times that I have despaired that my kid would OD and I would believe I could have saved him but did nothing. In reality, I have been fighting for him for 10 years. 

This young woman also fought for herself. She survived several days and nights in the ocean, sunburned, afraid, alone. In the end, her mom didn‚Äôt save her. Except, in her worst moments, a voice told her she would live and she remembered things her mother had told her that caused her to keep going. 

At his worst, my son‚Äîangry, hateful, crazy‚Äîtold me, just say the word and I will end my life. The implication was that he wished he could end his pain but didn‚Äôt because of his family. 

We limp along at my house. I long to have the calm predictable domestic space I had before he moved back home. I worry when he is obviously altered (just pot I suspect, the medication he takes for opioid use disorder continues to be a game-changer).

Mainly that I wanted more romance/intentional couple time together. 

I know it‚Äôs hard because adults are busy and we both have extra stressors. His young son, his mom passing 6 months ago, our jobs are high level corporate, I‚Äôm recovering mentally and emotionally from a freak medical incident that destroyed my life as I know it. Between his son and being on call outside of the office for work, there is one weekend per month where we truly have time for ourselves.

We have spoken multiple times about these concerns as I‚Äôve started to rebuild my life a little more independently instead of just being available for him all the time. He doesn‚Äôt like this distancing but to me, I‚Äôm taking my happiness into my own hands. He‚Äôs asked what I expect/want and I have given him specific examples. He said he used to be a romantic and a woman he was with made him feel bad about it.

I started getting these ""tumbles"" in my chest in Spring. First it was once every few weeks, then it increased to every day, then to hundreds+ every day. Some of them felt very ""violent"" - it felt like my heart stopped briefly and tumbled over in my chest. I'm young, healthy not stressed or anxious and have nether experienced these sensations before.

I got a Kardia device and an Apple Watch and caught a few of these ""tumbles"" that were identified to be PVCs and PVAs. I naturally freaked out a bit, stopped drinking alcohol and coffee altogether, but the frequency of these tumbles just further increased over the next month. My blood results and echo showed everything was normal.

I started thinking about what had recently changed. I realized that I have been upping my intake of the Sleepytime Extra tea. I went from 1 cup per week, to 1 cup every evening. The increase in my tea drinking correlated almost perfectly in the increase in my symptoms! I then read that the ingredients in the tea - valerian and Hawthorn - are suspected to be responsible for symptoms similar to mine.

Two days after stopping with the tea I was down to 2-3 tumbles and a week later I was completely symptom free. I know it sounds crazy, but I can't think that it's a coincidence. I have been symptom free for a few months now.

Growing up, I was always surrounded by people who didn‚Äôt really get it, but now that I‚Äôm older, I realize I don‚Äôt have to just sit back quietly. I can use my voice.

Yesterday, I was going through my social media, unfollowing anyone who openly supports Trump. There‚Äôs this girl ‚Äî more of an acquaintance/temporary roommate for the past few months ‚Äî who posted celebrating Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúvictory.‚Äù I slid up on her post and just said, ‚ÄúOh wow,‚Äù because it honestly shocked me. She‚Äôs someone who has a Black niece and a mom who‚Äôs a recovering addict, which, to me, are all reasons she‚Äôd be more compassionate and vote blue.

Right after I sent that, I unfollowed her, but then she texted me, saying, ‚ÄúHey, I know we‚Äôre both busy, but I was wondering if you and your girlfriend would want to get together Sunday morning for breakfast, coffee, or smoothies. I‚Äôd like to take you both out.‚Äù My girlfriend‚Äôs response? A hard ‚Äúhell no,‚Äù and honestly, I‚Äôm right there with her.

Like, I get that she‚Äôs trying to be nice, but no. She didn‚Äôt seem to care about us or our rights when she cast her vote, so I don‚Äôt see the point of playing nice now. This isn‚Äôt one of those ‚Äúagree to disagree‚Äù situations. She voted for someone who actively goes against the rights of me, my family, and my loved ones, and I just can‚Äôt look past that.

So, I‚Äôm kind of stuck. Part of me wants to be polite and take the high road, but I also feel like accepting this invitation would be letting her off the hook. How do I even go about handling this? Any advice?",14,1730990795.0,QueerWomenOfColor,20,0.86,False

# Background/training

Apologies for the novel!

I caught the running bug in middle school but never competed, just ran a lot for fun and to self-medicate my anxiety (I was a theater kid so no time/interest in organized sports). I went to college in NYC and got SUPER into running NYRR races, including the marathon twice, a 4:20 and a 4:06. Then promptly tore my MCL and meniscus skiing and thought my marathon days were over, especially once I grew a couple humans. Then in 2022 two things happened:

* I read Carrie Soto is Back by Taylor Jenkins Reid, about a (fictional) late-30s former tennis star who decides to go full send on a comeback. (Do I care about tennis? Absolutely not, see aforementioned comment about organized sports). And I thought to myself, what would happen if I tried really hard at running?
* My friend, at similar age and ability, informed me she had hired a coach. As a non-sports person, I was like, ""oh wait really, you can do that?"" So I started doing some track workouts with her here and there, and what do you know I started to get faster. Personalized coaching wasn't really feasible financially so I bought a Track Club Babe plan (Fast Fall, then Fast Marathon Level 2) and went for it.

As a frequently-injured runner, I didn't even fully admit to myself that I was training for a marathon until like, July of 2023. I registered for the Maine Marathon with a secret goal of 3:35 (BQ at the time was 3:40). And smashed it, coming in just under at 3:34:XX. Not enough for actually getting into Boston, but 30 minutes off a 17-year-old marathon PR felt pretty great. Unfortunately I did something to my knee, or all the skiing and running caught up with me, because shit was not right in my leg pretty soon thereafter.

After a couple of months of denial, cross training and PT, I went in for an MRI and was told I had a pretty jacked up knee. The LEFT one! Not even the known asshole, missing a meniscus. I won't get into the sordid details, but I'm missing a pretty critical piece of cartilage, and it's not one that can be repaired surgically. At the appointment with the sports med guy I was terrified he would tell me I needed to learn to love swimming (blech, sorry triathlon kids). Luckily he just thought I should back off on mileage, increase strength work, and then see what happened.

Cue the Rocky montage, I spent the winter as a very reluctant gym rat, trying to increase my squats and build up posterior chain strength. I worked with an amazing PT whose background is service members. My knee did not impress her, her attitude was basically, well, at least you have a leg, we can work with that. I dropped to 3 mellow runs a week and then did a ""long run"" on the weekends, alternating elliptical and stair climber while watching an unfortunate number of episodes of Love is Blind. By late April or so my PT said she thought I could try ramping up the volume and intensity of my running, so I did, and turns out all those squats must've done something because the knee held. I got through about 6 weeks of Fast Fall before...

I started the 18 w Fast Marathon plan from Track Club Babe. Given my injury risk I knew a lower mileage plan was for the better, I only ever ran 4 days/week except at the very end before taper, and maxed out at a 49 mile week. During the build I ran a 10K PR on a very steamy day on a hilly course, so I thought things were looking pretty good. I based all my training on a 3:25 marathon/7:50 pace. Even without much running through the winter, I think beating the shit out of myself on the stair climber plus a lot of hard peloton workouts and the strength stuff worked to keep or even improve my fitness, because paces that would have seemed impossible last year was hard but doable. I also connected with a couple of running buddies who are significantly faster than me, and they made the track workouts MUCH easier to get through.

I had a bit of a setback around the 10 week mark when I got the 'rona, had to take a full week off and then took it easy coming back. I only missed one big long run though, and I had enough time before the race that I didn't panic too much.

I was exhausted by the end of the build though. My spouse leaves for work at 6:30 every day so I have to be back by then for kid wrangling purposes. The midweek long runs got to be brutal, setting your alarm for 4am just does not ever get easy. I was hitting my paces spot on and thought I could do a 3:25 on a cooler day and a flat course, which Bay State promised. My last set of Yassos I averaged 3:22, giving me a big old boost of confidence. And then my very last workout-ish I ran a mile at what I thought was MP but when I looked down at my watch it was a 7:20, so I was feeling pretty confident going into race week

# Pre-Race:

I followed Meghan Featherstun's 3 day carb load. Honestly it was tough and I felt pretty garbage by the end of the first day. I am on the meatier side for a runner (thick thighs save lives, etc) and the amount per day seemed wiiiild. Mostly powered through, I don't think I hit the exact amount though, except maybe on the first day. The night before I slammed LMNT and Skratch and snuggled with my friend while watching McFarland (7/10 for pre-race movie) in our hotel. My plan was to loosely follow a 10:10:10 plan, starting out with the 3:30 pace group for the first 10 miles and then slowly drop it down to 7:50 or lower depending how I was feeling.

The morning was pretty good, drank my coffee, scarfed a bagel and some grams, had the all-important pre-race poop, popped an immodium, and then got to the start with enough time to porta potty again but not so long to allow my pre-race anxiety to spiral out of control. The weather was a bit warmer than ideal for me (I am a very sweaty human and heat/humidity are not my friend) but not the worst. I had two 8oz fitly water bottles in my shorts, a Nathan hand-held with LMNT, and roughly four thousand Never Second gels stuffed in my race crop.

# The Race:

I looked around for the 3:30 pace sign and couldn't find it. 3:20? yup! 3:40? There it is! No 3:30. A bunch of people standing around my vicinity were also looking for them, so I figured I was probably in the right place. Finally about 15 seconds before the gun went off I saw the 3:30 pacer for the first, and last, time. (Foreshadowing!)

Within probably five minutes of starting I knew that it was not going to be my day and my A goal was out the window. For one, the 8 minute pace that felt like a walk in the park a few days prior felt a little spicy. The pacer also went out HOT, clocking 7:50s from the gun. But that's not my race plan! I hung on for a couple miles but kept telling myself to run my own race and not worry about anyone else. But the downside was, I found myself pretty quickly in no man's land between pace groups. I literally chose this race because it promised fast and flat, and a lot of people run it for BQs so I thought there'd be a good number of people in my pace range. And there were, but they pretty quickly strung out. It did mean I wasn't doing a lot of dodging and weaving though, and honestly considering how the day went I think that would have put me over the edge into DNF territory.

Bay State is a 2 loop course, and by mile 5, which is also by the mile 15 marker, I was already thinking to myself ""oh wow by the time I'm here again I will be feeling BAAAAD."" My stomach felt super bloated and gross (too many carbs? who knows!) and my half tights already felt like they were digging in to me. I rolled them down for some relief so my mom tum was on full display the whole race. I choked down a NeverSecond gel every 30 minutes or so, alternating between caffeinated and non. There were maybe 3 miles in there that felt nice and not impossible, I think around 8-11. But the pace felt hard from the get-go, validated by my Coros that gave me an average of 165 - normally MP is more in the 155-160 range for me.

By mile 10 I knew this was going to be a gutting it out situation. The back half of the course is really nice, flat with lots of shade, and along the river. So I tried to enjoy it while not thinking about having to do another whole loop. At mile 12, again NOT EVEN HALFWAY, you go over a metal bridge and start the second loop. The bridge itself has kind of squirrely footing that did not feel great in my fancy supershoes. At this point it would have been so, so easy to bail. But I thought about all of those dawn patrol workouts, all of those long runs when my spouse had to solo parent for most of the morning, and then, let's be honest, most of the rest of the day when I was fit only for lying on the couch, and my dream of qualifying for Boston with enough of a buffer to run the race.

So it was time to buckle down. I tried to keep within sight of the 3:30 group, which was made easier by a lot of long straightaways. Once I got past the midpoint I started counting down. I tried to do some runner math on how slow I could run and still get a BQ, and hung on to just under 8 minute mile pace for dear life. With the second loop, I kept telling myself, ""well, at least you don't have to run this any more times!"" There was also a lot of reminding myself that I gave birth twice with no drugs, the second time on pitocin, and another hour would feel like hell but not as bad as that. I also looked forward to the leafy back stretch, and coming through the finish.

Around mile 21 my glutes started throbbing. Why? No idea! I had done a ton of glute strengthening before and during the build, so maybe they were coming late to the party to try to get me through the final miles but then promptly flamed out? I felt like I was shuffling in the last few miles, trying to do math on how many minutes were left, but math is damn impossible at that point in a marathon. I also could. not. fathom. downing another gel at the 3 hour mark, so I didn't. At that point it was getting pretty warm so would grab two cups of water at each aid station

Finally. FINALLY! The mile 25 marker came into site, and with it the last bridge. I gutted it out and tried to finish strong while dying on the inside. My friend, who had run the half, had somehow managed to make it back to her car and then out onto the course, so I saw her with a sign for me ""Hopkinton or bust!"" That gave me the final push I needed. Coming through the finish I somehow managed to raise my arms and not go straight to pause my watch (thanks, Keira D'Amato for the tip!) and got an actually pretty good finish line pic! 3:30:XX, a PR by a few minutes and \*hopefully\* enough of a buffer for Boston '26.

# Post-Race:

I just kept thinking ""wtf, why was that so hard? I was in way better shape than that!"" I must have looked like hell too, because one of the medical guys came over and asked me a bunch of questions before deciding that while in rough shape I was not at risk of imminent demise. When they gave me my medal I promptly burst into tears. I think it was mostly relief that I didn't have to run anymore, mixed with a spot of pride that I had actually gutted it out to finish. I quickly found my friend and collapsed into her arms, then promptly found a patch of grass and gingerly flopped in it. I eventually roused myself and limped over to the food tent. Baystate has hot soup for finishers, which sounds weird but a warm, salty, chicken noodle was nectar of the gods at that point.

Biggest postrace issue was nausea. I honestly felt like I had the flu for like 3 days, and it was hard to motivate myself to eat anything. I actually thought about taking a pregnancy test (impossible or at least highly unlikely) because it felt so much like first trimester. Legs felt pretty good within a few days - thanks super shoes! I also take that as further indication that I didn't fully run out my fitness. Took a full week off form anything and I've been doing some easy, easy runs and going back to the gym to build up my strength again.

Next up, Chicago! I really think I can go 3:25, maybe even a little faster if I manage to keep my knee together this winter/spring. And I'm kind of tempted by a local trail 50K in the spring. I wouldn't race it, I just think it would be  fun. The weird thing with my knee is it seems to like mileage - ""motion is the lotion"" as my PT would say. When I backed off entirely after the race, it actually felt worse. I don't think I would try for any higher mileage than this build, maybe just some higher intensity cycling/cross training.

Even though I didn't make my A or B goals, I'm maybe prouder of this race than others where I achieved my goals. I wanted to quit almost from the start, and at the beginning of the year I wasn't sure I'd be able to run another marathon EVER, let alone a 3:30. And it's the hard ones that really show your mettle, right? 

One weird thing, and this is where the request comes in - Bay State added 30 seconds to my time! There was definitely an issue with my chip, they have the chip tracker thingies at several points along the course but mine only pinged a couple of times - my family wasn't really able to track me. The day of the race I looked at the results and it gave me the exact finishing time I had on my Strava/Coros. But then the next day when I looked again they had added 30 seconds, so it matched the gun time but not when I actually crossed the start. I know with Boston every second counts. I reached out to organizers through the only email address I could find on the race site but haven't heard back. Anybody got a contact?",1,1730990603.0,AdvancedRunning,0,1.0,False

Curious about impact.,"As the title says, I ended up missing Lucanis' first companion quest, ""Coffee with the Crows,"" because I was excited to go get Darvin and didn't realize the game would roll right into that Act 1 save Treviso or Minrathous choice. 

I'm playing a Shadow Dragon, so I have to pick my Tevinter peeps, and consequently Treviso is now a blighted dumpster fire with not a coffee shop to be seen. The quest is also now marked as failed and has some sad text about how Lucanis didn't get to enjoy Treviso after returning from prison.

I'm not going to reload, because I don't want to go back several hours worth of gameplay when I'll likely do another playthrough, anyway. Plus, it feels realistic to miss an opportunity because shit hit the fan.

That being said, I do want to make sure this hasn't locked me out from his future companion quests. Has anyone had this happen and can you confirm whether or not you were able to do his future quests? 

I'm curious about how this will impact his character, but don't want to get far into the game only to realize I've been locked out of the rest of his content. ",1,1730990600.0,dragonage,3,1.0,False

1glrxa0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1glrxa0,Blue foam forming on copper solution ,"New to electroplating and I've yet to have a successful plating. I decided to change methods of creating a copper solution and followed a recipe that appeared to show good results in the videos. 
1000ml vinegar 
1000ml distilled water
60 grams baking soda
Teaspoon(esh) of salt

I ran copper anodes for around 24 hours at 2-3v and .5 amp (i think, if i remember correctly) but it might have been lower. 
My negative anode had a slow bubble build up and release while saturating the solution

While Creating the solution i did not have foaming issues. 
After about 12 esh hours The solution was making a nice clean, clear, and blue color, no foaming, i left for work came back (8 hours give or take) and the solution had the thick foam, in addition to a dense foggy like layer in the bottom solution. 
I tried filtering it out with coffee filters, but they get clogged up pretty quick with whatever the ""sediment"" is. 

I've ran a couple different currents and get the same results regardless.

1.8v and .1 amp
3v and .5 amp

I'm attempting to copper plate resin 3d prints.
I wash with alcohol multiple times, airbrush on a conductive graphite paint which is then ""polished"" to increase conductivity. 
I also wear gloves through the whole process to prevent contamination of the surface.


I've been have trouble figuring out my power supply in the sense that If I want to supply 1 full amp I need to raise my voltage to something like 6 or 7V (CV) otherwise it fluctuates and stays in the sub amp range. 
In other words I can't just set my power supply at 1-3 amps (CC) without having an obnoxiously high voltage 6v-14v.
No clue if it's a me thing, or a power supply thing, the owners manual yielded no instructions.
So until i figure it out im having to opt for a very very slow plating using low volts and amps. 



All right folks please tell me in what ways I'm a dummy!

I'm Swim, 22F going to be 23F soon!

I just a few days ago started a new job. I already put in my two weeks and my two weeks end on the 19th of this month. 

It's a doggy daycare inside the inner city. I was applying and got the job but there was no way that I would be able to plan for the food policy.

There is no food allowed inside the dog rooms where the dogs play and relax, no human food either except for drinks like coffee or water or tea etc.

The problem is that all of the food that I have for work are snacks designed to be eaten during the work day rather than just on break. It's been like this with the job before my previous job and the job before that previous job as well.

So I won't be able to have my snack pack at this new job. I need to bring like actual food to eat before, during break and after work. I don't have the money for that and my first shift starts on the 11th. 

Can anyone please help? My shift starts on the 11th but I get paid on the 15th. I don't have any money in my account so I'll be without food for work until the 15th and by then I'm already starting 8-hour shifts.

This is the Amazon list of cans of soup that will last me until the 15th, and then I'll be able to buy it on my own.

I can't seem to get off this bike. I ride it like a scooter. Even for doing small chores like going around the block, coffee shop. I easily put close to 50 miles a day doing meaningless trips back and forth. I've put a lot of miles on it since I got it... I thought the rush would end but it never did when I got it two years ago. Even in winters I ride.

Now, my work/relationships are affected too b/c I rather be riding than working ( I wfh)... anyone else just can't stop riding?

Also I don't know who said R1's are a pain in the city, I found it rather comfortable. I used to own a ninja 650 but I barely rode it. Even though the gearing was targeted for city driving, it never gave me pleasure.

1glrjni,https://www.reddit.com/r/agileideation/comments/1glrjni/good_vibes_only_culture_is_hurting_more_than_it/,"""Good Vibes Only"" Culture Is Hurting More Than It Helps‚ÄîLet‚Äôs Talk About Toxic Positivity","You‚Äôve probably come across it everywhere: ""Good vibes only!"" It‚Äôs on social media, in conversations, maybe even plastered across your favorite coffee mug. The phrase seems innocent enough‚Äîencouraging positivity, happiness, and good feelings. But here‚Äôs the issue: when taken too far, this mindset can lead to something harmful, known as toxic positivity.

What Exactly Is Toxic Positivity?
Toxic positivity is the idea that no matter how difficult or painful a situation is, we should always maintain a positive mindset. It‚Äôs the pressure to stay upbeat even in the face of struggles, setbacks, or emotional challenges. Sounds motivating, right? Well, not quite. Constantly pushing a ""positive vibes only"" mentality can result in emotional suppression, inauthenticity, and even harm your mental health.

When people feel forced to be positive all the time, they may feel like they need to suppress any negative emotions they‚Äôre experiencing. Over time, this emotional suppression can build up, leading to increased stress, anxiety, or even depression.

Here‚Äôs why the ""good vibes only"" culture can be damaging:
Emotional Suppression: Encouraging people to only focus on positivity often means ignoring or denying difficult emotions like sadness, anger, or frustration. These emotions are natural and serve a purpose. Suppressing them doesn‚Äôt make them disappear‚Äîit just makes processing them harder down the line.
Inauthenticity: The constant need to put on a ""happy face"" leads to inauthenticity, both in our relationships with others and with ourselves. When we hide what we‚Äôre really feeling, it creates a disconnect from our true emotions and prevents others from seeing us for who we really are.
Guilt and Shame: Toxic positivity can make people feel guilty or ashamed for experiencing negative emotions. In this culture, feeling sad or overwhelmed can be viewed as a personal failure, when in reality, it's part of being human.
The Balanced Approach of Positive Psychology
Here‚Äôs the distinction that‚Äôs crucial to understand: Positive psychology isn‚Äôt about ignoring the negative. It‚Äôs about fostering a mindset where we embrace all of our emotions‚Äîpositive and negative‚Äîand find healthy ways to process and learn from them. It‚Äôs not about pretending everything is great all the time, but about resilience, emotional intelligence, and authentic self-compassion.

In contrast to toxic positivity, positive psychology encourages us to:

Embrace the Full Spectrum of Emotions: Every emotion has a purpose. Instead of pushing them away, we can learn to understand and accept them. Emotional awareness helps us navigate life‚Äôs ups and downs with more clarity.
Build Resilience: Positive psychology is about building resilience, not denying hardship. Facing challenges head-on and learning from them leads to real growth and strength, rather than just slapping on a smile and pushing forward.
Promote Authenticity and Vulnerability: Being real about our struggles doesn‚Äôt make us weak‚Äîit makes us human. Real connections happen when we allow ourselves to be vulnerable, which fosters deeper relationships and builds trust.
Why This Matters for Personal Growth
Suppressing negative emotions doesn‚Äôt help us grow; it stunts our personal development. Growth comes from facing adversity, learning from failure, and understanding our emotions‚Äîboth the positive and the negative. Toxic positivity avoids these growth opportunities, while authentic positivity encourages emotional processing and resilience.

So, the next time you‚Äôre feeling low, resist the urge to brush it aside with a ""good vibes only"" mentality. Instead, take the time to sit with your feelings. Ask yourself: What are these emotions telling me? By giving yourself permission to feel, you‚Äôre already taking the first step toward real, meaningful personal growth.

Conclusion: We Can Do Better Than ‚ÄúGood Vibes Only‚Äù
While the ""good vibes only"" culture might seem appealing on the surface, it often leads to more harm than good. A more balanced approach that acknowledges the full range of human emotions is where true growth and mental wellness lie. By embracing authentic positivity‚Äînot toxic positivity‚Äîwe give ourselves the freedom to grow, to feel, and to connect on a deeper, more meaningful level.

If this resonates with you, feel free to share your thoughts, or if you‚Äôre interested in learning more about how to cultivate genuine positivity in your life, let‚Äôs start a conversation.

This post is part of my ongoing series on Toxic Positivity‚Äîwhere I dive deep into its effects, how to recognize it, and healthier alternatives for fostering emotional well-being. Stick around for more insights, and let‚Äôs build a space that encourages real, authentic growth!",1,1730989306.0,agileideation,0,1.0,False

1glri78,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1glri78/aiohow_close_is_your_spouse_with_their_coworker/,AIO-How close is your spouse with their coworker of opposite sex?,"This might be long winded but here we go..

My husband and I who have been together for almost 14 years founded our relationship off the fact that neither of us are to have friends of the opposite sex because we both believe that there‚Äôs always 1 person in the friendship who tends to want more than that. Fast forward to now and my husband recently became a co owner of a small business and is general manager, running the show and working very closely with all of the employees ( only about 20 people all together) 

Well he hired an office girl, she‚Äôs about 8 years younger than him, they sit in a very very small office together all day and basically stare at each other all day long so they have built a work relationship out of necessity and because they get along very well. 

When he first hired her he began texting her outside of work about non work related things as well as texting while they were at work sitting in the same room sending memes back and forth and what not all while he would leave me on read at 8am and I wouldn‚Äôt hear from him until he got home. I started asking if I could stop by the office with coffee or lunch and he would tell me that it would take too much time out of the day and that he didn‚Äôt want me to bother with it. Then I find out that on occasion he has gone out to grab lunch and bring it back to the office with his office girl. 

I should also add that my husband went to school to be a life coach and shortly after hiring the girl she began going through some difficult times with her boyfriend and would come to work and sit at her desk and cry, so my husband played therapist and let her talk to him and they went on a couple of walks at work so she could talk. Come to find out she thought her boyfriend was cheating and decided to sleep with his best friend and he found out. 

So now my husband is sitting in a room with a young girl who is emotionally struggling and morally corrupt and he is playing emotional support

I confront him about all of it and how it‚Äôs making me feel very uncomfortable and he ensures that there is nothing to be worried about and there is no ill intent. 

He has since stopped texting her about non work related things but they are constantly in contact because of work.

My husband has a very blue collar, joking, sarcastic relationship with all of his employees including her. He likes to get everyone riled up and jokes tend to be inappropriate at times. I knew this about him but he always worked blue collar jobs where he hardly worked with any woman at all so I‚Äôve never had to deal with him having this kind of relationship with another woman. 

Yesterday he worked from home and at the end of the day he had to call his office girl about something and when the conversation was over and he could have just ended the call he began asking her if she was on her way to pick up her daughter from daycare and just making small talk. I really don‚Äôt understand why he feels the need to do this with her when I have made it clear that their relationship makes me uncomfortable. 

Am I overreacting? Is it normal for co workers to be this close and friendly?

Im currently a SAHM and any job I‚Äôve had, I‚Äôve never allowed someone of the opposite sex to form such a close relationship with me out of respect for my husband, but I‚Äôve also never been a boss or leader where it‚Äôs really important for my employees to enjoy me and enjoy working for me so that they actually want to do their jobs.

Let me start by saying, I didn‚Äôt think I would be making this post today. After Tuesday, I have decided to put a pause on throwback Thursday. This series has been really fun and brought me a lot of joy but frankly, I am grieving right now and I think stepping away from all social media is best for my mental health. 

I deeply appreciate how you all embraced this series. I loved seeing your suggestions, comments, insights, and hilarity each week. Getting to introduce newer readers to older diaries was tremendously fun for me because digging up old money diaries was like my own personal Indiana Jones quest. I got to revisit some old faves, some long forgotten entries and a few hot messes. 

I know it may seem unnecessary to post this but I don‚Äôt want people to think I just disappeared or abruptly stopped doing the series. I do think with time I‚Äôll be back and if the temperature is right, I‚Äôll start posting again. Thanks for chatting with me every week. You all rock. 

And here‚Äôs an emoji/mini money diary. Made up of what I can remember about my finances. And the week. Most of it was easy to track because bank statements and this is the week of Halloween. I rounded my financial picture numbers to the nearest pretty number.

Age: 33
Location: AZ
Industry: Insurance 
Income: $59,000+bonus (up to $6k)
Debt: mortgage only: ~$220k left ($420k value per my insurance policy). Cars are paid off (KBB: $14k for my car, 16k for his) and my parents footed the bill for school
Paycheck (every 2 weeks): $1650 after taxes and deductions 

Monthly Expenses: Mortgage: $550 (my portion) Insurance: $225, Peloton: $48, Charitable Donation: $25, Apple Music: $12, iCloud: $2
Annual Expenses: OneMed: $149, Patreon: $53

Rapid fire: 
-parents paid for school, 
-fraught relationship over money, bad behaviors, lots of fighting, learned what not to do. Real financial literacy came from reading MD and further educating myself.
-first job was retail. I was really only allowed to be at home or school. A job allowed me one more place to be. 
-had everything and more growing up but money worries came at a mental cost and asking for or wanting things was held over us if we did something my parents didn‚Äôt like, such as  being children or teenagers. I asked for an iPod for my birthday one year and got this super cheap mp3 player instead. It has sat with me my whole life because I got in trouble over it. I told my parents I wanted an iPod and when they asked me about it, I was honest that I didn‚Äôt want an mp3 player, I wanted an iPod. I was deemed ungrateful. It broke after a few weeks.
-was kept at home by parents due to circumstances (not by choice) and became financially independent around 25; on occasion I receive financial help as their way of apologizing because they will never apologize. 
-longtime worries about money like retirement, feel ok otherwise. Parents and family could help us out. 
-received decently high five figure settlement from a lawsuit ~five years ago. Received a car when a relative died (this was another fight with my parents, who tried to say the car was given to them) turned into $8k on Trade for new car. I also got about 50 eggs from my parents in 2022. This is not an excessive amount of eggs for me. My siblings don‚Äôt eat eggs so it was only natural they went to me. 
-Finances are totally separate, if it‚Äôs not in my expenses, I don‚Äôt pay for it. I‚Äôm on the family phone plan, I don‚Äôt pay my parents. 
-~$20k between savings and checking, ~$27k in 401k, $2k in HSA. 
-Unsure of numbers for my spouse. He saves probably the same percentage of his income as I do and I would guess his 401k has slightly more because it‚Äôs a newer benefit to his company. He makes a little over six figures. I trust that what he tells me is true and vice versa.

Overall: I‚Äôm very boring. My payday was this week and I save $200 every paycheck (I aim to save $500/month). I also put like $300 towards my credit card, which currently has about $2200 on it. It is more than I like to carry but 2024 has been expensive (and I went to a Bach party over a month ago and one person hasn‚Äôt paid me back yet!). I would call this a typical week because I‚Äôm really not a spender. I think my biggest expense is groceries because I love to cook and bake. I am biased but all the recipes I made this week were amazing, especially the cookies. Although it didn‚Äôt quite look like it, I use my peloton every week so that $50/month is worth it. I just didn‚Äôt dedicate when I took classes with a üö¥ because it was with my running workouts. I was really worried you would all think I was a triathlete. So that‚Äôs me.

The *Cherry Pit*, Mark is a coffee shop just off campus on the corner of LeFlave Avenue and Main Street.  The 3 story building originally housed the telegraph office on the 1st floor and LeFlave Shipping on the 2nd and 3rd floors.  It is not a pit at all. Rather, an officious single origin, pour over, coffee shop with lots of kitsch and sexual innuendo. The name, students learn, derives from the fact that a [coffee bean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_bean) is not a bean at all, but the pit of the coffee cherry, a fruit. 

Cherry is the nickname of the buxom, scantily clad, caricatured barista featured on t-shirts, tank tops, coffee mugs and other merch labeled with slogans like *Strong and Black, or *Creamed* or *Creamer* or *Grinder* or *Make it Frothy*. It was made clear that Cherry did the grinding in her hot roasting room. She served it hot. Everything was steaming jungle, and vast mountain range. Coffee mugs for sale said *Black Only,* *Cream Me,* and *Hot Stuff*. 

For all of the of sexually charged merchandising, the cafe had a library feel and people were encouraged to ‚Äúbring a book, take a book‚Äù from the built in book shelves that separated the rooms and provided little nooks of privacy.

The baristas are typically townies, as the owners, Heather and Maria, don‚Äôt want to deal with staffing shortages when students are on break.  They do, however, provide tuition assistance at both a nearby junior college and St. D. The uniform consists of overalls and a Cherry Pit shirt, crop top, or sweatshirt. Employees get a 50% discount on t-shirts and sweat shirts, and an 80% discount on crop tops.  Of course, Heather and Maria do not officially encourage female baristas to wear Cherry Pit crop tops, and nobody has ever noticed a practice of crop top girls getting better schedules.
