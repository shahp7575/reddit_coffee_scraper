Not exactly a health nut—he’s never counted calories, never hit the gym, and kind of shrugged off diets.

But a few months ago, his doctor told him his weight was creeping up and that his energy dips weren’t just “getting older”—they were a sign something needed to change.

He wasn’t into making big lifestyle shifts, but my cousin (his daughter) suggested something she found online called Java Burn. It’s this tasteless powder you mix into your morning coffee, packed with green tea extract, L-carnitine, chromium, and a few other natural metabolism boosters.

Now, Mike’s the definition of a skeptic when it comes to supplements. But he figured, “I’m already drinking coffee every day—why not?”

He started in late December, didn’t change his eating habits, and by mid-February, he casually told me:

**“I’ve already dropped like 12 pounds, and I haven’t even tried.”**

**As of early April, he’s down 18 lbs. What surprised him the most?**

💥 More steady energy throughout the day

😴 No mid-afternoon crashes

🍩 Way fewer random cravings

🚶‍♂️ And he’s more active—not because he’s forcing it, but because he just feels lighter

He’s not calling it a miracle or anything, but for someone who wasn’t doing much else differently, it really got things moving in the right direction.

And now? He’s cutting back on sugar in his coffee (totally on his own) and even asked me about walking trails nearby.

It made me think—how many people just need one small tweak to jumpstart things?

Has anyone else tried coffee-based supplements that actually did something? I know there’s a lot of gimmicky stuff out there, but this one kinda surprised us.

1jyzrbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jyzrbr/my_29f_bf_28m_met_with_his_ex_recently_and_now_im/,"My (29F) BF (28M) met with his ex recently, and now I’m questioning — can we save our relationship?","PSA: this will be a long one. Please grab some coffee and a donut before reading. 

Let me start with some context. We've been together for one year (known each other almost 2 years), are living together, and I have never before questioned his love for me. We have different ethnic backgrounds (mine being European, his Asian) but it has never been a problem for us. His family love me and ""approve"" of our relationship, and mine are the same toward him. 

Recently, we went on a vacation to his home country together. I had to return home early which was planned, and he remained for a few more weeks. While we were there together, we both agreed it was the highlight of our relationship. We had amazing experiences and both felt secure, loved, and absolutely head over heels for each other. This, I am sure of. He even made it clear to his friends that he wanted to propose soon. We discussed our plans for the future together seriously. 

When I returned home, however, he became more distant. He told me he was feeling depressed about life and work. A few days before his return flight, he went cold on me but promised to tell me what happened when he returned. 

As promised, he told me in person that he had met his ex to ""say goodbye"" in person as their breakup had been long distance, and seeing her again made him question who he loves between us. Nothing else happened between them, according to my partner, and I believe him. He has never lied to me before. I need to trust that he wouldn't do that to me now. 

I don't know much about the ex but I do know that this was my partner's first love and they broke up due to serious financial issues on her side (spending lots of money on shopping and travels that she didn't have and could never pay back) and his family and all of his friends do not like her or approve of her. His family are wonderful people and very open-minded, so I doubt they dislike her based only on her spending habits. What I can say is that the man I knew like the back of my hand was an entirely different person after speaking with her. It felt like I was talking to a stranger. 

After some hours, he told me he loved me. Not her. But he video called her twice that night and they said ""goodbye"" AGAIN for 4 hours in total. I will skip through some of the issues we've had since then and explain where we're at now. 

We are sleeping in separate bedrooms at the moment after agreeing to take a break for a week and have another discussion about our relationship after that. We're a few days away from that talk. I moved all my shit out of our room and packed most away, bar for a few items. We're on good terms and he talks about us as if we have a future together. We are rediscovering a fun side of our relationship, a banter that is really nice to see coming back. He's still not himself but I believe it has more to do with his overall negative state of mind than it has to do with her. I can see that he's trying, and I told him that if he tries I can do the same. I do think there is hope for us to rebuild our relationship, but I want more action from him; more initiative to make me feel special after putting me through hell these past few weeks. With that said, I also understand that he needs to focus on himself and I support him in trying to get back on his feet. 

I know every relationship needs work, not all days are sunshine and rainbows, but this has tested me. Can a relationship come back from something like this? Does anyone have a similar experience, and how did their situation end up? ",1,1744639709.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I’m trading the “mattress‑on‑the‑floor in someone’s half‑finished attic” vibe for an apartment that feels like an actual home, and I’d rather pick that home with my future roommate than gamble on a Craigslist lottery ticket.

A quick sketch of me
Quiet ninja energy: I cook, clean, and vanish. Headphones on for late‑night gaming; dishes done before the pan cools.


Vices kept minimal: No smoking, barely drink, caffeine is my only reliable flaw.


Pet‑friendly: Dogs, cats, bearded dragons—if it’s house‑trained and adorable, I’m in.


Social bandwidth: Down for board‑game nights or respectful parallel introverting. We can calibrate the hangout dial as we go.


What I’m hoping for
Budget sweet spot: $800–$1,050 each (rent + utilities split evenly).


Timing: ASAP—my lease clock is ticking, but I won’t rush a bad fit.


Location: Worcester proper or nearby towns with decent coffee and decent parking.


Co‑architects, not strangers: We tour together, pick the place together, and sign together. Clear roommate agreement so nobody’s guessing who buys the next roll of TP.


If you’re also tired of rolling the housing‑dice and want a say in where you land, drop me a line (or fill out the tiny form below). Tell me your favorite comfort show and whether you’re a morning person, night owl, or chaotic neutral. We’ll set up a quick video chat, swap references, and see if the vibes align.
Looking forward to building a chill, scam‑free nest with the right human. Talk soon!

1jyzmso,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jyzmso/aita_for_calling_out_my_mum_for_the_way_shes/,AITA For calling out my mum for the way she’s treated me this week,"Hi everyone, I (17F) am feeling pretty hurt and just want some outside perspective. My mum (46F) got married this weekend, and while I know it was supposed to be a happy occasion, I walked away feeling ignored and unimportant.

Some context: My mum can be very stubborn. She often says her family is toxic and plays the victim a lot. We’ve had rocky moments — I’ve even stayed with my grandma before due to arguments — but things had been calm lately, so I thought we were okay.

She met her now-husband in December 2023. He lives in another country and seems nice, but we barely know him. My younger sister (13F) and I met him briefly in December. Our older sister (27F) only met him a month ago. Despite all that, they got married this past weekend after getting engaged in December 2024.

From the start, we were kept out of the loop. My mum didn’t tell us anything about the wedding — not where we were staying, not how we could help — she left it all to our older sister to explain.

On Friday, we went to help set up the church. My mum didn’t help at all. She bossed everyone around and even told a friend, “I’m just going to pretend to look busy.” My younger sister went off with a friend’s little sister, and I stayed behind to help with decorations. Later, my mum told me to go help with chair covers, then got annoyed when I didn’t do it her way, even though I knew how.

The next morning, she was meant to arrive at my grandma’s at 10am to grab her dress and have coffee but showed up at 11:15, said a quick hi, got the dress, and left after five minutes. That was the extent of our interaction before the wedding.

At the ceremony, things felt tense. The pastor (a family friend) wouldn’t make eye contact with my grandma. During the document signing, my mum chose our grandad (who she often says she dislikes) as her witness — not my grandma or someone else close. After the ceremony, I tried to hug her, but she ignored me, so I kept my distance to avoid upsetting her on her big day.

Then came the dinner, which was the worst part. The seating was strange — my grandma, little sister, and I were separated at the same table so we couldn’t talk. My older sister sat with my mum and her new husband. We didn’t cause a fuss but had to keep getting up just to speak with our own family. Guests were asking why we weren’t in the wedding or seated with our mum, which was super awkward.

When she left, she didn’t say goodbye to any family members. That night, we were meant to stay with our grandma, but our dad picked us up instead. We were upset and ended up crying in the car as we explained everything to him.

The next day, my mum asked if my little sister and I wanted to get breakfast before she left for her honeymoon. I didn’t want to — I felt completely ignored and hurt — but she insisted. I talked to my older sister and asked if I should share how I felt with our mum, and she encouraged me to.

So I called my mum to explain. I tried to express how being ignored and excluded hurt, but she interrupted me, brushed it off, and told me I was being “spiteful” and making things up. She ended the call angrily. I later texted her that other people had also commented on the weird seating and our lack of involvement, and she blew up again — sending message after message, even after I asked if we could pause the conversation.

Eventually, I stopped replying. She kept messaging me about random stuff (like the photography plan which had nothing to do with what i was saying) and I just got overwhelmed. I told her again that we could talk later, but she wouldn’t stop.

This morning, she sent me a message that she had sent to my grandma and older sister which was completely false and made up i called her out on this and she  is now saying “I didn’t expect you to be able to take responsibility for the way you behaved last week in the lead up to the wedding or on the actual day but I wasn’t prepared to be accused of terrible things  without having the opportunity to give my perspective”

My husband (42M) is a night owl and wakes up around 10:30 on the weekend and about ten minutes before his workday starts the rest of the week.

Even at that late hour, when he wakes up he's a grumpy mess. He can't even walk straight.  We recently got kayaks and he wants to go with me in the morning. 

The thing is, part of the reason I wake up early is so I can deal with him when he gets up.  He isn't a bad guy he's just grumpy and annoying before 9am: he constantly clears his throat and yawns loudly, he communicates in grunts, walks around giving everything a nasty look, and has no control of his tone.

He has asked me to start turning on the light in the bedroom when I get up and ""be nice to him"".  I turned on the light the past few days and he just rolled over.  The last two nights, he has stayed up past midnight playing a video game.  I already make him coffee and breakfast every weekday and I frankly don't want to coo him awake like I'm his mom when when he can't even go to bed earlier just so he can maybe go kayak with me once a week in the morning on Sunday.

As is, I take the morning time to bathe, do my hair, check socials, do some cleaning, watch the sunrise, think about my outfit for the day, make us coffee, figure out breakfast and make a to do list.  I mentioned taking the kayak out in the morning a couple times a week because I thought it would be a nice little treat for me.  I had not idea he would want to come with.

**Money Diary**

**Monday:**  
7am-ish: I wake up and hit snooze twice. Music comes on - bossa nova - through my google home speaker, and I roll out of bed and make my way to the kitchen to grab a cup of coffee. I do a quick yoga flow in my living room, which has an east-facing window - perfect for praising the sun. I make breakfast (3 slices of bacon and a lemon/ginger juice) while I listen to the news before starting work at 8:30am.

Right before 12pm: After working for a few hours I dash out of the house to make it to a pilates class. There are no bikeshare bikes available, so I take a scooter and apparently don’t lock it properly - oops - resulting in a super long ride. Pilates is great. I take a bike home. I wrap up work, take a shower, and make and drink another juice. I text the woman I’ve been seeing for a while, S, to make sure we’re still on for our date tomorrow. She confirms.

S is a categorically cool gal. We met through a dating app back in November. Aside from some spurts of travel between both of us, we have seen each other pretty consistently since then, and have started to increase frequency as of late.

6:30pm: I close my laptop, make a quesadilla, and get dressed. I meet up with a neighborhood friend. We met last year on Hinge - had one date and I decided I wasn’t into it - but we are neighbors and ran into each other recently and decide to get together for a friend hang. We walk to a nearby cocktail bar I hadn’t been to. While starting our second round, he confesses he thought this hang might be a date but it’s cool with him if it doesn’t turn out that way. I am mortified. It is absolutely NOT a date, and I do my best to not entertain this idea. We finish the drinks and pay our own way **($40.12).** On the way back is my local dive bar (also his - he lives around the corner). We grab a third drink, and I buy the round as an apology for any miscommunication **($9)**.

11pm: I walk home, make a weed drink, and do my weekly-ish intensive skin/haircare routine: cleanser, toner, serum, moisturizer, and sleep mask; + I massage jasmine oil into my hair and put it in a bonnet. I smell amazing! Around midnight I go to sleep.

Daily spend: **$49.12**

**Tuesday:**  
7:15am: I wake up but don’t roll out of bed for another half hour. I grab coffee and come back to bed and scroll. I take a shower; the jasmine oil smell lingers a bit in my hair. Work is fine today. I have minimal meetings which is great. S texts me about our evening plans.

6pm: I finish work and sit outside. Somehow it’s 70 degrees which is largely unheard of for March in Chicago. My cat sits in his tent on the porch, and we are distracted by a squirrel.

6:45pm: S arrives, and we walk to a nearby Irish pub and grab a table outside. We chat over beers and end up planning a trip to a nearby city together to visit each of our best friends. I’m excited for us to take a trip together! I buy a round **($21.36)** and she buys one.

8:45pm: we walk home and get cozy chit chatting and hanging out with my cat. I mention to her that we should check in to see how the other is feeling in the relationship - technically there is no official *relationship* so to speak, but it feels like we’re moving into that direction. We agree that a check-in is needed but that we don’t want to do it right now. Maybe next week.

11:15pm: we are going to sleep, and we hear 5 **loud** knocks at the door. S looks outside and sees flashing lights. The police are here! At my *house*! I have obsessive compulsive disorder, and a huge obsession and fear of mine is being arrested (more broadly - getting into trouble). As a result, I have a massive panic attack while S gives me updates on what’s going on outside. The police speak to my downstairs neighbor and then make their way to the bottom apartment. They leave after about 10 or 15 minutes. I call my mom to calm down. S holds me and keeps me grounded. I can’t sleep, so we put on a podcast and take a gabapentin. I cry a little bit from the overwhelm and eventually fall asleep.

Daily total: **$21.36**

**Wednesday:**  
7am - I wake up. S is still sleeping. I have an emotional hangover and am feeling very tender. She wakes up and checks on me.

8:30am - I begin my workday. S hangs out and makes some phone calls. She makes breakfast for us, and we eat together. She heads out after breakfast, and we make plans to see each other next Tuesday - she is traveling with her family this weekend and lets me know she might not be able to text that much, which I appreciate.

I text my downstairs neighbor to offer my support to whatever happened last night. They get back to me and tell me they believe it was a wellness check on the first floor neighbor. I’m relieved and hope he’s doing ok.

Work is ok. I am tired and still a bit shaken up from last night. I email my therapist to see if she can squeeze me in this weekend - she responds that she has availability!

2pm: I have my regular check-in with my CEO, who is my direct supervisor. She mentions that she is putting a meeting on my calendar for Friday to discuss an interpersonal communication issue I had recently and reported to her. Even though I don’t feel I’ve done anything wrong, I get a pit in my stomach.

6:40pm - I leave for my pottery class. I’m delighted to find I have a great haul from the kiln which leaves me feeling super excited! While at class, a neighborhood friend texts me that he’s at the dive bar. I tell him I’ll meet him there after class.

9:15pm - meet my friends at the dive bar. Talk about pottery, S, work anxiety, and other life things with the other regulars. I have 3 beers but only pay for 2 **($10)**. I make plans with a neighbor friend to get lunch on Friday to try a seemingly delicious Mexican onion soup!

11:30pm - I leave the dive bar and walk home. I realize I forgot to eat, so I order the quickest fast food Doordash has to offer **($10.90)**, using a credit on my account from a botched grocery delivery earlier in the week. It arrives quickly; I demolish my food and go to sleep.

Daily total: **$20.90**

**Thursday:**  
8:15am - I wake up after sleeping in. S is about to get on her plane, so I wish her a safe flight. I take my time getting out of bed and start work around 8:45am. Work is ok. I’m feeling anxious for tomorrow’s communications meeting.

6pm: a friend of mine comes over. We are planning a trip to Japan in November and have our first planning session tonight! We don’t get a ton done, but we do nail down the dates and budget and a high level of what we’d like to do, so we chop it up and call it a success.

7pm: we wrap up planning and pick up a mutual friend to go shopping. We stop into Bath & Body Works - they are interested in a Disney princess line of hand soaps, and I want to pick up some shampoo and conditioner that I can never find anywhere but BBW has recently started stocking. I get a 4-for-3 deal on the haircare and snag some hand sanitizers. **($67.14)** After BBW, we swing into Target where I buy some groceries and essentials **($35.88)**. Unfortunately for my friends, I am HANGRY and a little unpleasant to be around. I make a party pizza when I get home and go to bed.

Daily total: **$103.02**

**Friday:**  
8am: I wake up and feel immediately anxious for my comms meeting but try to make it through the day. My call has been moved up, and as a result I have to cancel my lunch plans.

2pm: I have my call with my CEO, and it goes *terribly.* What I thought would be a quick check-in ended up being over an hour long call regarding how my communication style doesn’t work for people. Even though my CEO frames the conversation positively, I am devastated and very emotional. Thankfully, I have reported to her for a long time and she knows me well, so I’m not terribly embarrassed to be crying. We work out a plan to make work easier moving forward, and she tells me to take the rest of the day off and start the weekend.

330pm: I take a shower to wash the bad feelings off and bike to the pottery studio. I do some experimental glazing. From there, I bike to an aerial fitness class. It’s a beautiful, albeit windy, evening, and I’m so excited to ride my normal bike instead of bikeshare.

7pm: I bike back home and walk to a nearby pizza spot where I have a slice and a beer **($16.77)**. After, I’m still feeling pretty tender and want to be social, so I walk to the dive bar and run into a ton of friends. I tell them about my bad meeting, and everyone is so kind and really lifts me up. It was great for my confidence. I use the ATM **($2.75 fee).** As I am about to leave, my impossible neighbor crush comes in, and we chat for a while. We had previously gone out in the fall a couple times, and then he ghosted me. He’s absolutely not a realistic romantic option for me, so I’m glad we have developed a nice friendship, or perhaps friendly acquaintanceship, because he’s always fun to chat with. I stay at the bar until 1. I have four beers but only pay for one **($5)**.

I walk home and make another party pizza and go to bed.

Daily total: **$24.52**

**Saturday:**  
8am: I oversleep hot yoga. Oops. This isn’t really unexpected though. I figure I’ll eat the cancellation fee and live with it.

9:30am: I jump out of bed, make coffee, and ride a bikeshare to therapy. Therapy is amazing. Obviously a lot happened this week, and she is so helpful at reframing it and helping me through.

11am: a friend texts and asks if I want to grab brunch. I say yes! I bike up to meet her. At brunch I have a breakfast burger and a juice **($37.45)**. After brunch, we walk down the block for some quick thrift shopping where I buy a very fun pair of red-tinted sunglasses **($15.99)**.

2pm: I bike down the street and pop in for my scheduled pilates class. I absolutely half-ass this workout but am glad I went.

3pm: I bike home and take a half nap before hopping on my bike once more to go to the pottery studio.

7pm: After 3 hours of spinning the pottery wheel, I bike home and get pizza… again. It’s not lost on me that I have eaten pizza effectively four meals in a row. Two slices of pizza and one glass of wine costs **($20.94)**.

Around 9pm: I get home, download a dumb game on my phone, and play it until 1 in the morning before passing out.

Daily total: **$74.38**

**Sunday:**  
10am: I sleep in and wake up to watch the news. I’m supposed to go climbing with a friend today and need to confirm with him. I confirm but ask if we can push back a few hours from our original plan. I get some laundry done. I’m charged for this week’s bikeshare rides **($29.54)**. I can’t wait for it to warm up so I can ride my normal bike more consistently.

12pm: my pottery studio releases their new classes online at 12pm once a month, and it’s extremely stressful. The classes typically sell out in minutes, if not seconds. I strategically refresh my laptop every few seconds and manage to snag the class I want. Phew!

130pm: I take a super quick shower and head out to bike to the climbing gym. I sign up for a membership which I had already been considering for a while. My friend is super skilled at bouldering, while I am brand new to it. We’re there for about 4 hours and have a great time - he is hilarious and has a LOT of energy which is super fun to be around for spurts of time (together, our energy makes us a collective menace). I leave the gym *super* sore.

5:45pm: we bike to dinner. We share a nice meal **($33.99)**, but he has such terrible table manners that it stresses me out. After a while, I excuse myself stating (truthfully) that I’m exhausted and need to go home.

730pm: I arrive home and play my stupid phone game and wrap up laundry and chores until it’s time to go to bed. As I’m falling asleep I’m delighted to get a late text from S with an update from her trip! I don’t have the brain power to respond at the moment but will in the morning.

Reflection:

Emotionally this was a very difficult week, but apart from that it was fairly typical. I drank a little more than usual due to having so many social invitations but did not experience any alcohol regret this time (unlike last MD). I did more fitness classes than usual due to ClassPass credits expiring. A more typical schedule would be 1 or 2 (a mix of yoga, pilates, or aerial).

We’ll have someone watching our kiddo, so it’ll just be my husband and I. 

Here’s the rough itinerary I’d like, if yall could offer some recommendations on where to go:

Heading into downtown/surrounding area, stopping at a cool coffee shop, sitting down and enjoying that, or potentially taking it to go and going for a little stroll if it’s near a trail 

Renting a SUP and paddling on the lake for a bit

Go to a cool spot for lunch, thinking nice outdoor patio, more on the casual side 

Go to a couple bars and hop around for cocktails, either within walking distance of lunch or I don’t mind taking an uber around 

Maybe find some cool shops to check out. Could be clothing, home goods, art, beauty, plants, anything!

After months of late nights and countless coffee cups, I'm excited to share my solution to a problem that's been driving me crazy: **constantly switching between AI assistants and work applications when I need writing help**.

**The Problem:** We all know what we want to say, but sometimes struggle to articulate it clearly (especially us non-native English speakers). While AI tools can help, the workflow is incredibly disruptive:

* Open a separate app
* Copy your context
* Wait for AI response
* Copy the result back
* Rinse and repeat for every edit

**My Solution:** [**QuickInput.AI**](http://QuickInput.AI) I built an AI writing assistant that integrates directly into EVERY application on your computer:

* Press a hotkey (Ctrl+Alt+Q) or use the floating input bar wherever you type
* Type your rough idea
* Get polished text inserted DIRECTLY where you're working
* No switching apps, no copy-pasting, no disrupted workflow

[Writing scenarios](https://i.redd.it/tm15melh2tue1.gif)

**Key Features:**

* Works in ANY application with text input (emails, chats, docs, presentations)
* Smart context recognition adapts to what you're doing
* Remembers conversations across different applications
* Seamless text insertion without disrupting your flow
* Especially helpful for non-native speakers needing to craft professional-sounding messages

I built this because I was tired of breaking my concentration every time I needed writing assistance. The tool has already saved me countless hours when writing emails and documentation.

**Current Status:**

* Windows version available now (macOS coming soon)
* Free 14-day trial at [quickinput.ai](https://quickinput.ai/)
* Solo founder, bootstrapped

I'd love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or feature suggestions! Has anyone else tackled similar workflow problems with AI tools?

P.S. Happy to answer any questions about the tech stack (Python + PySide6) or implementation challenges!

During the summer i spent an entire night at the hospital because i was throwing up constantly and couldn't drink any water or eat anything without instantly throwing up again. I didn't eat anything that entire day except a really small tuna can and drank one coffee. I threw up like 25 times and all of it was clear water (i filled up whole buckets of water just by throwing up once or twice) that night and literally felt like i was about to die. Im a pretty massive dude that goes to the gym but i have never taken creatine before until that summer. I stopped taking it 2 months before i ended up in the hospital and now im thinking if me taking creatine caused this and if i should start taking it again (i drank a lot of water and took normal doses btw). It's almost like none of the creatine was absorbed properly by my body just sat somewhere and absorbed water if that makes sense.

I work as a TV producer.

I'm a good communicator - it comes as part of the day job 🥰

I love to smile.

I love to take and receive goofy selfies.

I work almost exclusively from home, with some exceptions.

I consider myself to be emotionally intelligent, healthy and believe that supporting one another is a virtue.

I try to skateboard - big emphasis on the try here. It's something I picked up when going back to my parents house a few years ago and I've decided 2025 will be the year I learn how to Ollie.

I play video games - but lets be honest here. I'm pretty bad. If you want to see I'm only a Fortnite game away 😭

I look after myself - I cycle around town to keep trim and I've recently restarted at my gym. But, and as unoriginal as this maybe sound, my favourite food is probably burgers.

I try to stay well-informed about current events. Mostly with politics, tech news, and economics as I find them very interesting. (Also I love to debate/talk about these things).

I have been told that I have a nice accent!! (Voice clip here if you'd like to check it out! [https://voca.ro/1l6464yu2Gqd](https://voca.ro/1l6464yu2Gqd))

So all of this leads to the big moment: what I'm looking for:

Well in it's basic form, I'm a switch I'm in a female led LDR, something I once could have only ever wished for.

She is someone who brings me exceptional joy to my life and will play a role in the relationship I'm seeking.

We've had a few discussions and she's decided I need a bit of an outlet for my dominant desires.

We are looking for someone who is tender, who we can both look after but in return, does her utmost to keep us satisfied. 

We're particularly interested to hear from people who are into degradation but we're not asshole. We both want to lean in and fulfil our partner's needs, wants, fantasies, and desires.

Our goal in this is to make our partner, feel appreciated and special; the best relationship's we've had in the past have been through clear, honest communication.

I'm not ashamed to admit that I can get a touch needy, particularly if I'm sleepy. The rush I get from a message is sometimes more addictive than a cup of coffee for sure! I can recalibrate myself if I know my partner is busy and finding my own way to keep myself occupied.

Physically, neither of us have too many preferences outside of not wanting anyone under 19 or over 45. Our sexual attraction is more based around your personality, our chemistry in and out of kink rather than physical appearances.

**The Problem:** We all know what we want to say, but sometimes struggle to articulate it clearly (especially us non-native English speakers). While AI tools can help, the workflow is incredibly disruptive:

* Open a separate app
* Copy your context, explain some backgrounds
* Wait for AI response
* Copy the result back
* Rinse and repeat for every edit

**My Solution:** [**QuickInput.AI**](http://QuickInput.AI) I built an AI writing assistant that integrates directly into EVERY application on your computer:

* Press a hotkey (Ctrl+Alt+Q) or use the floating input bar wherever you type
* Type your basic idea
* Get polished text inserted DIRECTLY where you're working
* No switching apps, no copy-pasting, no disrupted workflow

https://i.redd.it/lcbv6lv6zsue1.gif

**Key Features:**

* Works in ANY application with text input (emails, chats, docs, presentations)
* Smart context recognition adapts to what you're doing
* Remembers conversations across different applications
* Seamless text insertion without disrupting your flow
* Especially helpful for non-native speakers needing to craft professional-sounding messages

I built this because I was tired of breaking my concentration every time I needed writing assistance. The tool has already saved me countless hours when writing emails and documentation.

**Current Status:**

* Windows version available now (macOS coming soon)
* Free 14-day trial at [quickinput.ai](https://quickinput.ai/)
* Solo founder, bootstrapped

I'd love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or feature suggestions! Has anyone else tackled similar workflow problems with AI tools?

P.S. Happy to answer any questions about the tech stack (Python + PySide6) or implementation challenges!

I'm excited to announce version 3.0.0 of my **Color Palette Formats** package, which lets your Flutter apps read and write color palettes in various industry-standard formats.

## What is this package?

Color Palette Formats allows you to import and export color palettes across a wide range of formats used by professional design tools like Adobe Photoshop, Procreate, GIMP, Paint.NET, and many others. This makes it perfect for building color picker tools, design apps, or any application that needs to work with color collections.

## What's new in v3.0.0?

### Breaking Changes
- Renamed several formats for clarity and consistency
- Reworked some APIs for better usability
- Now targeting Dart ≥3.7 and Flutter ≥3.29

### Major Additions
- Added support for 7 new palette formats including Adobe Color Book Legacy, CorelDraw 4, KOffice, Scribus, and more

The package now supports a total of 19 different color palette formats!

Check out the [full README](https://pub.dev/packages/color_palette_formats) for complete documentation and examples of how to use the package.

Lessons learned,"I (31f) have just one partner at the moment, Cedar (34M). June (25NB) is a relationship that I had end immediately and I wanted to share about it in the hopes for others to avoid some of my mistakes. 

June and I met through a mutual interest and we've hung out several times. I thought June and I were just forming a friendship. We're in a club, we're similar in age, and we were both able to speak about our other partners and understand how shit works.

June has spoken to me about their other partners, July (22F), August (30M), and September (27NB). After June and I hung out a second time -- coffee after our club -- June told me they had spoken about me to July, August, and September as well and asked if that was okay. I thought it was fine at the time, because I'd also told Cedar about June. I was making a new friend and was excited about it, so i told my partner. I assumed June was doing the same. But it should have raised an alarm bell, since June asked if it was alright. You don't usually ask if it's alright to tell a partner about a new friend. Hindsight. 

Later, June invited me to a party and told me all of their partners--along with lots of other friends--would be there, and asked if I'd like to meet them. I said sure, that was fine. I've heard a lot about all of them, so why not put faces to names? June also asked ""would it be weird"" to introduce me to a family member. I said not at all, bc why not meet a friend's family member? HINDSIGHT.

I had a very stressful week and had to interact with some family I've gone NC with. I told Cedar and June--and other friends I normally speak to-- I was going to take time to myself to recoup. My friends and Cedar were completely supportive and said ""see you when you're ready."" June said the same and then sent me link after link to motivational tik toks for days. I didn't correct them because I didn't particularly care; I just ignored it.

June and I hung out one last time and June kissed me. I was surprised and asked what that was about. 

June informed me that they thought it was fine, since we'd been ""dating"" for several weeks now, we'd both informed our partners of the new relationship, and I'd met my metas. They had also already told some of the members of our club that we were a couple. I apologized for the confusion and explained that, without an explicit conversation, I am not dating anyone, and told them I was not interested in a romantic relationship with them. 

June had a full crash out. They accused me of leading them on and of humiliating them to their other partners and our club. Most offensive, though, was that they attacked my dynamic with Cedar, because we see each other once a week and Cedar's nesting partnervprefers that we stay parallel. June said they were ""offering more"" because they have more time, attention, and care to give. I was floored and told June they needed to leave.

I haven't had an ""I thought we were friends but they had ulterior motives"" relationship since college, but this felt beyond. June thought we were already IN a relationship, because ""polyamory isn't as black and white as monogamy and you don't have to declare things like that."" Wild perspective, imo. Even if that's how you see it, you need to declare it with me, so...

Anyway, lessons learned: clarify intentions (""let's be friends.""), address anything that's odd (""Is it okay that I talk to x person about you?"" ""Why are you concerned it might be inappropriate?""), hold boundaries even in platonic relationships (""I've asked for space, please stop sending these.""), and yes you absolutely DO need to clarify the nature of partnerships. 

Happy Monday, yall.

I'm currently just using a hario manual grinder and a aeropress & mokapot. I often drink milk drinks like flat whites, cappachinos ect. I'll likely be making 1-2 a day.

After a few days of YouTube videos and reading reviews I'm leaning towards getting an DF54/DF64 grinder and a Gaggia classic pro E24 with brass boiler.


I did consider the Sage Bambino but I like the idea of a more robust machine that can be fixed and modified down the line. (Plus I love the looks of the Gaggia)

Budget wise i can spend around £600-£800 but that's a loose figure, can spend more if needed but don't want to go crazy.

I'm hoping to get one new, and then down the line once I feel like I've got enough time out of the warranty start modifying it, either with a PID or Gaggiuino.


I think my main question is how usable is the machine for a novice without significant upgrades?

The only time so far I have been able to speak to a neurologist in person was at one of my ER visits. When I saw her there she rend  only ran AChR blood test markers and weeks later they came back negative. I've also had a EMG done for bilateral upper extremity weakness but they claim the results of that are also ""normal""..

After advocating for myself, constantly messaging her through the MyChart portal, she only finally ordered additional other labs for LRP4 autoantibody, VGCC Type P/Q autoantibodies, and a motor neuropathy profile a few days ago, and I know all those will take WEEKS to come back..although my symptoms right now currently feel like they are strictly respiratory related..except that I have also been having ongoing extreme fatigue, urinary retention/constipation. 

No facial drooping, vision involvement, balance issues, no limb weakness or paralysis or difficulty swallowing. Just MAJOR shortness of breath.. it feels so shallow.. running out of breath when I talk is very alarming to me..I constantly have to speak in shorter phrases before stopping to collect myself. And no matter how much water/coffee I drink during the day, I'm usually only pissing at night. I NEVER fully empty my bladder and have started wearing incontinence pads in my boxers due to leakage. My pelvic floor muscles feel nonexistent anymore, literally.  I won't have a bowel movement for up to like 5 days despite taking Miralax and fiber gummies (yes I'm aware the Suboxone i take could contribute to this but it never before did in the past). I eat a lot of fresh fruit although not very many veggies at all. And should cut down on the dairy..

But this feeling like my diaphragm and/or other respiratory muscles are going to fail because my breathing feels so shallow and weak caused me to askmy pulmonologst to  perform supine spirometry along with PiMAX and PeMAX testing last week. The supine spirometry showed no significant change from upright (FEV1/FVC  76% upright to 74% supine ). 

However my PiMAX expected score was >70 and  I achieved -90. My PeMAX expected was >150 and I achieved +112. 

I questioned him about how this is not indicative of muscle weakness his response was: ""Below expected PEmax is not specific and not well reproducible. It does not diagnose neuro muscular weakness by itself. But that is a discussion you best had with your neurologist."" 

When I looked up what my results might mean for myself , all I can gather is that supposedly since I scored higher than expected for PiMAX, my inspiratory muscles are fine, but the lower than expected PeMAX score indicated weakness with expiratory muscles..intercostals (?)

This makes sense to me because whenever I try to do anything useful to improve these feelings, i get so frustrated I give up. It's like impossible. Like diaphragm breathing, and pursed lip breathing. My inhale is twice as long or longer than my inhale, shouldn't it be the other way around?

So I ordered a powerBREATHE EMT muscle training device off their website. Anyone have experience with those types of devices (are they effective in improving strength of respiratory muscles at all)?

After seeing that neurologist during my February ER visit, they scheduled me to follow up with another one and I have an appointment with him on the 18th, and have brain/spine MRIs with and without contrast scheduled for the next day..

I keep doing ""single breath count tests"" on myself. As ridiculous as it may seem since I am not formerly diagnosed with anything yet , I cannot let this feeling go of my breathing muscles failing..and having to be intubated or some shit going to need to go to the ER, because I am constantly running out of breath when I speak. Scoring myself with the metronome @ 120bpm, I can usually score between 40-50..if it's 50 it's a struggle though. And that doesn't correlate into my normal speaking habits. In a normal conversation I have to gather myself pretty frequently for breath.

If I ever do manage to fall asleep wake up in a panic because my whole body feels numb/tingling, breathing is even shallower than while awake, and like I can't get enough breath into my lungs. I feel like I also have sleep apnea or I'm retaining too much c02 when I sleep because or SOMETHING.

I just don't know what to do in the meantime. I don't even know if this is even MG for sure, neither do the doctors..
I'm just at the end of my rope with all this.

I guess my main question is should be worried about going into an MG crisis with those PiMAX / PeMAX results, and be able to usually achieve a decent SBCT result?",1,1744636869.0,MyastheniaGravis,1,1.0,False

Please generate a 16:9 image of a cat cafe called Cups and Whiskers. The viewpoint of the picture is from the inside. You’re near the back of the cafe. You’re facing the front. It’s a mostly glass front. Think big picture window. The name Cups and Whiskers is written on the glass in stylized writing. It’d be backwards because it’s on the outside and you’re looking from the inside. It’s dark inside. Not pitch black but the cafe is closed and the only lighting is from whatever light is coming in from outside. It’s around 9pm. This cafe is in Paris with a good view of the downtown Paris streets and the Eiffel Tower in decent proximity. It’s raining outside and there are some people with umbrellas. There are no people inside but lots of big comfy chairs and some of the cats. Its closed so the place is tidy but there’s a few random books on a coffee table and maybe a blanket thrown over the seat on the loveseat by the counter. And a coffee cup still sits on an end table. As for the cats, they’re randomly in the cafe. Maybe one in the window looking out, one on a chair, one lounging on the bookshelf. Have it be the same art style as the lofi girl from that YouTube live stream.",1,1744636637.0,ChatGPT,2,1.0,False
1jyymj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jyymj4/extreme_hunger_after_weight_loss_i_ate_an_entire/,Extreme hunger after weight loss- i ate an entire rotisserie chicken and was still hungry,"Hi,

I am 36f, approx 5'4 and 130lbs. Currently taking no medicines or supplements except a women's multivitamin and imitrex for migraines, not daily, usually only a few times a month.

I have always had a problem with an unusually bug appetite since I was a kid and have been to too many doctors to count. I don't have diabetes, prader willie syndrome, thyroid issues, or any of the other typical causes of excessive hunger. I have had every test under the sun. When my GP couldn't find anything wrong he told me I have depression and compulsive food behaviors. I have been to numerous mental health psychologists, psychiatrists, and even specialists for eating disorders. Numerous psychologists and several psychiatrists have told me I don't fit the criteria for food addiction, eating disorders, OCD, etc, and they say it's physical and send me back to the GP who sends me back to them and it is this repeated back and forth. 

I never became obese, but I did get to be fairly heavy, at my highest weight I was about 165 lbs. My doctor kept telling me lose weight lose weight, so I did. I began exercising and cut out all refined sugars, which is something I didn't eat much of to begin with (my diet has always been fairly healthy but I would occasionally drink juices and eat prepackaged snacks like chips or cookies. Maybe 1 serving, 2-3 times per week.) Now, i only drink black coffee (1 cup in the morning) and water. I do not eat any refined sugars or Carbs, I cook  everything i eat myself, and I eat a lot of fiber and protein with every meal. Snacks are things like a handful of almonds, a boiled egg, or an apple. My problem is that after losing about 30lbs, I have become constantly insatiably hungry. My stomach is always growling. My GP told me to try various dietary changes, none of which helped. Most recently they has me start ""volume eating"" where is eat a large amount of bulk fiber like vegetables and beans woth every meal to help me feel fuller. I will eat a large meal (last lunch was an entire bag of frozen Brussel sprouts, 4 baked chicken legs, a can of red beans, and an entire baked sweet potato with 1 tsp olive oil and salt). Within about 15 minutes of finishing the meal I am hungry again.

I try to distract myself, go for walks, drink water (I drink 64oz water every day from a measured bottle). I chew gum. I eat healthy snacks. I am just constantly hungry to the point that it is interfering with my life. I'm so hungry all the time it's hard to concentrate, I'm grouchy, and I feel way worse than I did when I was heavier. My health has improved (cholesterol, blood pressure, etc) but I feel like my appetite has become out of control. 

I went back to the doctor and they did the same song and dance about depression and OCD, so I went to yet another mental health doctor who was recommended by the GP for working with people with OCD eating  disorders. I went there and again, this doctor said I am not consistent with  OCD or depression and she thinks it is a physical issue. She told me to ""honor my hunger"" and eat as much as it tool to feel full, whenever I felt hungry as long as I continued to eat healthy foods. So, I tried following her advice to eat whenever I am hungry and eat as much as it takes to feel full. 

In the span of a week, I probably ate more food than the average person eats in a month. For one dinner, I ate AN ENTIRE rotisserie chicken, 4 cups of chopped cauliflower and broccoli, and a plain Greek yogurt cup. I was starving again within about an hour and I ate 2 cups of oatmeal with an entire pint of strawberries mixed in. I gained 5lbs within the week. 

I am now back to controlling my portions, because I don't want to gain weight again and have to keep hearing every doctor tell me all my symptoms are because I am overweight. 

Is there some kind of medication/supplement/herbal remedy i can take to control the feeling of being constantly hungry? I don't need to lose anymore weight, I just can't stand feeling like I am ravenous and hungry 24/7. This can't be normal, I don't even know how I am fitting all the food into my body.",1,1744636606.0,loseit,4,1.0,False

about me: I'm 28 and from the eastern united states. I'm a huge nerd for animals and nature, and I love learning about entomology, paleontology, and marine biology. I enjoy gaming and have over 4k hours in one of my favorite video games. I also like crafting and make my own stuffed animals by hand. I enjoy hanging out in quiet cafes, visiting museums, and regularly going to my local aquarium to see my favorite penguin. I collect stickers, trinkets, decorative birds, and sanrio merch. I love hello kitty, iced coffee, disco music, vintage tech, and video essays on theme park history. overall I'd say I'm pretty easygoing and straightforward. I love unironic enthusiasm about the little things in life.

if you think we'd get along and you want to chat, feel free to send me a message and introduce yourself.

1jyyi4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1jyyi4w/not_even_sure_where_to_start/,Not even sure where to start...,"The last month has been a rollercoaster and im not sure where to start or end this post.

For a couple years now we've noticed that my mother has been getting a little forgetful but nothing more than abnormal from what we could observe. Mostly like stuff that we had to be careful or she could accidentally spill the beans about a surprise for the kids.

 She's 72. Im 39 and have a wife and 4 children.  My mother is single and does not have any other family but us. My sister is estranged from us. We live about 3 hours from her house where i moved to where my wife is from to start our family instead of moving the kids away from all their friends and family. (My wife has a large family here)

Towards the end of March my mother started expressing that she was having trouble paying her bills. We immediately offered to help her and manage everything for her and drove to her house. She had dark circles around her eyes and looked almost grey and didnt have much food in the house. Shortly after this she was in tears about not wanting to be alone and we took her back to live with us.

This is where I started to notice more problems. She has okay long term memory but her short term is gone. She can be triggered by almost anything it seems too much information, not enough information, being with her too much or too little. Im truthfully almost fearful of our interactions at this point.

We also set a plan to buy a house that would accommodate all of us as where we are is no where near large enough. We were out growing it on our own. She has been thrilled about this but is now looking at everything as we are not thankful for her financial help to accomplish this as she can't remember many of the conversations. 

To set this in context I watched my sister drain my father dry till he passed and I would never abuse the retirement money my mother has saved. If anything my life has gotten more expensive since starting this journey as I have already taken about 3 weeks off of work to try and help settle all her affairs and help her being comfortable at our house. The weeks before that as a truck driver i was short 15 hours of overtime for maybe 2 weeks as I was stressed by this and could not push for extra work as normal. 

I could care less about the lost income. The part I struggle with now is when she says nobody thanks her and that she thinks she is being used. That hurts. We thank her constantly because we're aware it hurts her if we don't. She listens to everyone's conversations and ifbshes not mentioned in relation to anything about our move she becomes upset.

She feels lost here and seems miserable and wants to go back to her condo which I am entertaining as a short term idea i also dont want her to feel trapped. Its her life and her retirement and she earned it so i want to help her get to whatever makes her happiest. I approached it as she can come and go from our house to hers as she wants whatever makes her comfortable which seemed to be a positive idea. 

I originally was working still when we brought here for the first week but when I am not around she seems to be more irritable and says things like nobody cares about what she's going through. 

She doesn't want to do anything but then complains about just sitting around. She won't even entertain turning on the TV or she will complain about what the kids turn on. We're always offering her food because all she does is drink coffee or hot water and eats dry cereal because thats what she says she likes with her coffee. I think it's just familiar so she does that on repeat. We had breakfast and a salad for lunch thebother day and she looked upset around 4 pm and started saying she hadn't eaten all day and when I reminded her of what she ate she was basically accusing us of starving her and asked to see a scale. For what its worth she looks much healthier here as weve been able to guarantee that she has been eating.

Tomorrow is her first doctor's appointment since weve started all of this and she is pretty negative towards it. She wants to return to her condo the next day. I am already afraid that bringing her back there will be us abandoning her in her mind. 

This is the tip of the iceberg for my last month.
I feel lost and hopeless. By nature I am a fixer so my anxiety has been through the roof and ive upped my meds. I just want to help my mom but I feel that every thing she asks me to do for her backfires on us. She even seems less interested in spending time with her grandkids which used to be everything to her.

I want to cultivate an environment and lifestyle that is fulfilling and in alignment with my goals and beliefs. I also want to remind myself and others that it is not a waste to take time to do little things that make you happy. 
I’ve been trying to meditate on the venn diagram of satisfaction and happiness and do I really want to just be happy with my life or do I want to feel a deep sense of satisfaction with my lived experience. And how different are those emotions.

1jyyf7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1jyyf7b/how_would_you_respond/,How would you respond?,"I'm relatively new to polyamory. My current partner and I had an agreement that we were only doing swinging together and not dating separately. Since they had previously set up in-person meetups with people they connected with on dating apps like Feeld, tinder and facebook dating but said they weren't dates and they were only seeking friendship, I asked them explicitly if they would inform me if they were meeting up in person with anyone from a dating site for any reason at all. They agreed to this. I also know they like to be spontaneous so I asked if they would tell me afterwards if something off the cuff happened so I could stay informed. They agreed to that as well. I asked this to be agreed upon because I don't want to be in a relationship with someone who can't go a month without meeting up with a new potential sex partner from a dating site and having this agreement would help me determine if this person is a good fit for me or not. I've repeatedly told them I am a demisexual and am not interested in lots of new people in my life for the sake of novelty and that I prefer small networks of close connections, and that I would understand if this difference makes us incompatible as partners and we need to transition to a platonic friendship. 

We had a big fight over drama with one of their ex partners and have been having ongoing drama with their ex partners the entire time we have been dating so it's really gotten to a peak at this point. One ex partner moved in with them as soon as we started dating and transitioned to platonic partnership where the ex partner lived nearly rent free in their house with a severely aggressive dog. This ex has little to no other forms of support and relied solely on my partner for most emotional and practical support. The dog caused multiple wounds on my partner and their dog and my dog was bitten and injured as well but no new boundaries were set with this partner in spite of the harm occurring. The other ex is constantly wanting to try to reconnect and become friends again or rehash the past in the name of closure and that continues to cause ongoing drama because this ex hates me and thinks I stole their partner and is even circulating a draft book all about how awful polyamory is and it clearly references my partner and myself in their anecdotes and examples of bad actors to avoid. So we have been arguing about their inability to cut off toxic and codependent ex partners who continuously cause drama and suffering in my life. They insist these aren't poly relationships because they don't put their penis inside of these women anymore so it's nothing for me to worry or stress about because the penis isn't involved and that's apparently all that matters to most people. 

They had been unresponsive to my texts asking if I could go pick up my vacuum cleaner recently after a fight so I asked them the next day if there were on a date with their other ex they reconnected with on Feeld (yes another ex girlfriend has now entered the picture) who they had been feeling out a threesome with me a couple of days before and I had said no because they said this woman had pushed the boundaries he had stated clearly 8 years ago when they had dated. Sounded like a minefield of problems knowing the history. Of course he had rushed off to meet up with this ex immediately after we had a blow out fight. When I said I was upset by this because we had an agreement to only date together he said we had a fight that negated our previous agreements and that it wasn't a date it was just a friend meetup and that she had kissed him while she was at his house but he told her he wasn't open to sexual activity now and it stopped. 

I reached out to her and learned what actually happened is they had been flirting sexually online and in person for over a month so that was actually their second meetup, not their first, and the ""kiss"" was actually 5 hours of rolling around in bed with only their pants on making out and doing above the wait foreplay and saying seeet things to each other. She expressed being confused when he was kissing her head and petting her hair because it didn't seem like what platonic friends do so she has also been confused about the nature of their rekindled connection. I told her where my boundaries have been during their reconnection and how I have communicated them to him. We both agreed that we feel misled and like he was trying to omit important information so he could keep me and her despite us both telling him his desires didn't fit within our boundaries. She wanted a minimum of once a week dates with him and had made that very clear to him. He made her believe there was at least potential for that while telling her how bad he wanted to fuck her while telling me I could relax and not worry about anymore dating drama because he was ready to focus on just us too and that we could take a break from adding new sex partners. 

When I confronted him about all of this he says he shouldn't have to tell me about every coffee meetup he has with friends. And that he was being considerate not to mention anything but a kiss from her and if I wanted the other details I should've known to ask for them. He wasn't lying by omission it was my failure to ask that was the problem. He also said that he wasn't dating when I got into bed with him right after sex a couple of weeks ago and saw a pretty brunette on a Facebook dating profile on his phone. He says he saw a notification on Facebook and clicked on it and there are women on Facebook and I have to expect him to talk to women sometimes. 

I just feel like I am going crazy because I thought I had done the right thing by saying I can't handle the drama nonmomgamy has been bringing to my life (I have not been dating anyone else or bringing any relationship drama to our lives at all during the time we have been dating since I've spent most of my adult life single). I knew this probably meant we had to break up because maintaining relationships with his ex partners and supporting them and never giving up on them is clearly very important to him as is being free to meet up with and have sexy fun with new people from dating sites. It felt brave to be honest even when I knew it may mean I lose him. I don't understand why he makes these agreements if he has no intentions of actually honoring them because he can word smith and word salad his way like a politician to explain why everything he does is being a nice guy and not wrong because nothing ever seems to be dating related when I think most people would call what he is doing exactly that. 

Would appreciate input and support. Are all poly people like this? Does anyone doing poly actually work on themselves and make sure they have the skills and capacities needed to actually do polyamory in an ethical way? Isn't this basically cheating while using the guise of polyamory to justify it and make it about my insecurities instead of his inability to be honest with himself and with me about his intentions and plans for the future?

Background Information:
I (M20) was getting a suit fitted for upcoming family events the other day.
My Mam and Aunt were with me (important).
During the fitting, the girl (F20s) we were working with was very chatty with me.
I thought nothing of it, just general polite and fun retail worker.
She was also very chatty with my Mam and Aunt, asking quite a few details about me. Like more than I would when I was working retail in clothing stores.
She also gave us a discount when she didn't have to (I'm in college so I just asked if there was a student discount)

I'm picking up the suit this Saturday. She told me personally that she'll be there at a certain time when I'm ready for pick up.

My Mam and Aunt think I should ask her out (Women's Intuition as they say) and I want to give it a shot.
I have mentioned this to my friends and it is unanimous that I should ask her out.

What should I say?

I was thinking something along the lines of;

""Hey, I know this is a bit out of nowhere but I think you're really pretty and I was wondering if you'd be interested in getting a coffee with me one of the days.
Would tomorrow or sometime next weekend work for you?""",1,1744635917.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I clutched Yasmine's body to my chest, firing my mag pistol one handed as the Ashari flooded out of the trees like a swarm of insects. The battlefield was silent for me, whether from injury or mind numbing grief I didn't know. Ainsworth was a hurricane of sharp and lethal bladework, shouting in Greek as he dueled the Ashari, sometimes three at a time. His spear flashed and danced like an extension of his body. Balan was a blur, ripping open the necks of one Ashari after another, his blade and pistol each moving as though with a mind of their own. Vanders fired pulses one after another until the barrel of his rifle glowed red and sparks leapt through the weapon, then he pulled his pistol and kept firing, barking orders.


“Tighten up the formation!” He killed an Ashari pod born by crushing its neck with his prosthetic arm, “I want a defensive line fifty paces back from that treeline.”


More troopers died as the platoon moved to carry out the lieutenant's orders. Gamal seemed to be screaming as he fired shards of supercooled material into the Ashari, his white eyes fierce under a furrowed brow. A few seconds later he fell under an onslaught of blows from two full born Ashari. Taggard was in a brutal hand to hand fight with a pod born, the sluggish movements of its underdeveloped muscles keeping him from being overwhelmed as the two traded blows. Ashari corpses were littering the ground between our position and the trees, and our corpses were beginning to become a common sight. Troopers fell and the semi-circle of survivors shrank.


McGill, a strong man who I hadn't gotten to know very well, began swearing profusely as his pulse rifle finally shorted and steamed. Throwing the broken weapon aside, he drew his neuro-disruptor and pierced an Ashari as it swiped a spine blade at him. Ainsworth was in the middle of pulling his spear from an Ashari skull to continue the fight when a shard ripped through his head. His head snapped back and sprayed crimson into the air as his eyes rolled back. He stood for a moment, as though unsure whether he should fall or not. Then his body collapsed backward into the soil. White and crimson blood covered his body and the earth around it.


We were thirteen now, the numbers of the enemy were thinning as well, but their numbers doubled or tripled ours still. As if a switch had been flipped, the sounds of the battle came back to me. Underneath the chaos of weapons fire and screaming troopers, I heard something familiar yet strangely foreign here in this place. It took me a few moments to realize what it was. It was engines screaming in the distance. I was almost afraid to tear my eyes from the battle, but I glanced down at Yasmine. Her deathly stillness and blood-soaked armor convinced me I had nothing more for the Ashari to take. I looked back toward the wall.


There were vehicles coming, ripping across the terrain. Recon trucks armed with .50s, medevac trucks. From the sound of their engines they must have been pushing the vehicles to their limit. I turned back and shot another full born in the neck, the explosive round detonating and separating its head from its body. It didn't matter if help was coming, I'd stay right here. With Yaz. I fired until my mag pistol was empty. I threw it aside angrily and looked for my dropped blade. It was a few feet away, but I wouldn't leave her. I found Yasmine’s blade tucked on one of her shoulders and pulled it out, leaning my body over hers with the tip of the blade pointing out toward the enemy. I waited for them to come.


Vanders looked back desperately, his eyes roving over the broken corpses of our friends and comrades as they traveled to the Recon vehicles. Just as he caught sight of them, a shard ripped through his throat. I watched him fall to his knees, choking, a look of grim surprise painted on his face. As he fell, the roar of the .50 cals reached us. The Ashari sprouted massive holes in their bodies. A sweeping wave of death reached out from the vehicles behind us and wiped away the aliens. A few survivors were snuffed out by concentrated fire from our ragtag group. Some, like Taggard, took the fragile peace following the fight at face value and collapsed onto their knees or simply fell to the ground exhausted. Others, Yaki and Chen, cried openly. McGill and others stared blankly at the carnage, unmoving.


The vehicles pulled up behind me, and I heard medics and Recon troopers pour out and shout commands. My focus was on Yasmine. Her freckled face was pale and her lips were stained with the blood she had coughed up. I waited to see some sign of life, something to tie me to the world around me. A medic roughly grabbed my arm, and I punched him in the face. He fell back clutching his nose before Balan's face came between us.


“David, he wants to check on her, he's going to see if he can save her.” His voice was soft and understanding.


The medic was cursing at me, but two more came over and separated me from Yasmine. Balan took me by the arm and as he led me over to a medevac truck, I noticed his wrappings were torn and there were burns criss-crossing his face. The fading sunlight was still causing steam to rise from his exposed skin despite his attempts to keep it shadowed. He pushed me into a seat in the truck and put his face in front of mine.


“I'll stay with her, I won't let anything happen to her.” I nodded numbly in response.


Balan left me there and a medic came to check on me briefly, noting the blood staining my armor, hands, and arms. I didn't say anything as he examined me. I just stared at the wall in front of me, praying.


God please, not her.


I was still staring at that wall when more troopers were loaded into the truck, some unharmed, most injured. I didn't try to talk to any of them, and the few of our platoon still alive didn't try to talk to me. It was too much for words. We each sat in our own, personal, broken, silence.


The rumbling and jostling of the APC-17 Recon vehicle told me we were heading back to the wall, not that it mattered much to us. If the others were feeling what I was, none of us had actually left that small knoll yet. The dead and the living were one and the same—trapped in those final, hellish—moments. When we arrived at the blast door I knew because the APC I was in stopped briefly, long enough for the door to open, before resuming its slow advance.


We filed out of the vehicles slowly, barked at by Recon troopers who would normally be our lessers. Their orders weren't without compassion, though many of them looked at our few remaining non-human members with a mixture of wariness and astonishment. They simply had to bark and yell in order to reach the ears of any human member of our platoon. I saw Balan for a moment, supervising Yasmine’s transfer from the barely passable life support of the medevac to the medical wing of the Recon facility with a stern and menacing look on his face.


I slowly drifted after them as they wheeled Yasmine toward the facilities that might be able to save her life. Almost magnetized to her presence, I meandered through the halls with her neuro-disruptor in my hand, its blade covered in white and red blood. The world around me seemed at once to be moving too slow and too fast. She was my guiding light. As long as I followed her stretcher, I wouldn't lose sight of myself.


Balan's hand stopped me out of the blurry, ethereal edges of my shell shocked vision.


“David, she's going into surgery, the doctors already sent a message that she'll be in there for hours.” His eyes were softened now that he wasn't trying to strike fear into the medical staff, “You need a shower, and some sleep.”


I focused on his face for a few moments, willing the haze of numbness to part enough for me to really look at him. His burns weren't healing as quickly as they had when I had accidentally exposed him to UV. His arms and torso were covered in small nicks and cuts that were just barely healed. He looked almost as frayed as I did. Maybe. I hadn't actually looked at myself.


“I'll be fine, go, rest and recover so you can be there when she gets out of surgery.” He said softly, noticing my eyes roving over his wounds.


I nodded slowly and too quickly all at once, nausea building in my stomach as I did. My body clunkily about-faced and shambled through the halls. Twenty minutes later a CDF grunt yelled something I couldn't understand behind the strange disconnect overcoming me. When he took a closer look at me he paled visibly and I could see him talking on his comm. His voice distorted strangely as it reached my ears, as though we no longer spoke a common language.
A few moments later, a trio of officers came and began gently guiding me with hands on my arms. I didn't resist. When I found myself back at the once secret base of the ERP, I noticed a few of Balan's vampiric friends, Russeau and Filoni if I remembered right, were the only ones holding it together enough after the mission to tend to the rest of us. Russeau guided me to my barracks room, and I collapsed. Rodriguez’s bunk was covered in half finished projects and spare parts, remnants of his last minute adjustments to the relay and his technical acuity. Russeau stayed for a few moments, then dragged me to my feet and shoved me toward the shower gently. She left, closing the door behind her. I stripped off my armor and shirt, realizing there was so much human and Ashari blood covering both that I couldn't tell if I had been injured when I looked at it. The medic who had checked me had done something other than check my vitals, but I couldn't remember what through the haze. I stumbled as I peeled off my boots. My pants hit the floor with a squishy smack. Whether it was due to urine from fear, mud, feces, or blood I had no idea.


I stood naked under the shower head, turning the knob to send water splashing across my body. Cleansing the sweat, blood, and muck of the battlefield off. I collapsed under the water, tucking my knees to my chest and hugging them as tears came hard and fast. The weight of it all was crushing. The loss of Rodriguez, the new threat we had witnessed, the loss of almost every member of the Defiant Few. Twelve left standing, not even a full squad. Forty of us had left these walls and barracks cracking jokes about making the aliens run home in fear. It was too much. I sat there for a long time as the water turned steaming hot, then lukewarm, and finally ice cold. Eventually it was the water that calmed me, long after I had run out of tears and was simply sobbing dryly into my knees.


I stood and turned off the shower, the cold water bringing sensation back to my skin. When I stepped out of the shower, I stopped next to the mirror. The shard that had wounded Yasmine had splintered and several large chunks had still pierced my armor enough that I had deep wounds bleeding slowly down my chest. A gash from something was lining my right cheek, it looked like it might need stitches. I was bruised and cut and battered, but somehow I was relatively fine. My wounds would heal in weeks and wouldn't prevent me from performing my duties.
Once I was dressed and my head was clear enough to navigate the hallways, I walked out to the communal area in our base. The secrecy of our organization had gone out the window. Recon pulling us out of the fire meant there were now one hundred and eighty other people who knew the location and nature of our platoon. I could see evidence of this in the CDF sergeants guarding the entrance. I had a momentary double take when I looked at them. I remembered being afraid of sergeants or thinking they were old when I was in the CDF, with the exception of Marcus. These sergeants were older than me, sure, but for some reason they looked like kids playing soldier now. I looked down at my bruised and cut hands.


I guess after what we went through, only Recon guys might be able to understand some of it. Even then, what would they know about having to hold your breath while an Ashari steps on your hand so they don't hear you breathing next to their leg?


I stood in the doorway from the barracks, watching for a moment. The common area smelled of stale coffee and antiseptic, a faint tang of blood lingering beneath it all. The battered remnants of the Defiant Few sprawled across mismatched couches and folding chairs. Twelve of us, a fractured circle around a dented steel table littered with nicotine misters, half-empty ration packs, and a cracked holo-map still flickering with Coeur D’Alene’s ghostly outline. I’d scrubbed the blood off my skin, but it still felt like it was there, staining my hands as I stood in the doorway, watching them.


Chen sat cross-legged on the floor, her medic’s kit open, swearing softly in Cantonese as she stitched a gash on her own forearm. Her tears had dried, leaving salt streaks on her cheeks, but her hands didn’t shake. “Fucking Ashari,” she muttered, tying off the thread. “Next time, I’m shoving a cryoshard up their asses.” Her sharp tongue cut through the silence, a lifeline to the fire she’d kept burning out there.


Beside her, Yaki leaned against the wall, cradling a pulse rifle with a scorched barrel. She wasn’t crying anymore, just staring at the weapon like it might tell her why she’d made it back when Evans and St. George hadn’t. She caught my eye, nodded once—small, mechanical—then went back to her silent vigil. Her fingers traced the trigger guard, a ritual to keep the ghosts at bay.
Taggard slumped in a chair, his shoulder wrapped in bloody gauze, one hand clutching a woodworking chisel he’d pulled from his pack. He dragged it across a chunk of pine, shaving curls onto the floor, his breaths ragged but steady.


“Gonna make a box,” he rasped, voice frayed. “For Rodriguez’s tools. Maybe we can bury him with them.” His sarcasm was gone, replaced by a quiet debt he’d carry now.


McGill stood apart, near the guarded entrance, his massive frame still as stone. His neuro-disruptor lay across his arms, its blade chipped but gleaming with dried white blood. He didn’t speak, didn’t blink—just stared at the CDF kids like they were intruders in our graveyard. When one glanced his way, he bared his teeth, a silent warning from a man who’d fought hand-to-hand and won.


Russeau glided between us, her vampire grace unnerving against the fluorescent hum. She pressed a cold pack to Finley’s sunburned neck, her voice soft as she murmured in French, “Trop de soleil, idiot.” Finley, sprawled on a couch, grinned weakly, his black eyes half-lidded. “Worth it to rip those bastards apart,” he said, flexing a hand still crusted with Ashari gore. His bravado flickered, but it held—just.


Filoni hovered near Yang, who’d claimed a corner with a nicotine mister clamped between her teeth. She exhaled blue-gray mist, her tools glinting as she fiddled with a busted comms unit. “Should’ve smoked ‘em all,” she growled, slamming the device down. “Almost there whole platoon, dead for nothing.” Her jittery edge was dulled, exhaustion creeping in, but the fight still simmered in her glare.


Ripley sat at the table, hunched over a cracked data pad, replaying grainy footage from the facility—those grotesque pods, the newborn Ashari slithering free. His fingers trembled, but he didn’t look away. “We got in,” he said, voice low, like he was convincing himself. “Saw what they’re building. That’s something.” He’d been steady in there, slicing throats with Erickson, and now he clung to that shred of purpose.


Goody perched on the table’s edge, humming “Danny Boy” under his breath—soft, haunting, the tune Imran had shut down days ago. His outer-ring grit showed in the dirt caked on his boots, but his hands shook as he rolled a nicstick between them. “Big guy’d hate this quiet,” he said, cracking a faint smile. “I figure he’d tell us to sing louder.” The levity broke, his eyes dropping to the floor.


I stepped in, boots scuffing the concrete, and they all turned—eleven pairs of eyes, hollow but alive. Chen smirked, tossing me a ration bar. “Eat, West. You look like shit.” Taggard snorted, a ghost of his old bite, and Yang flicked her mister at me like a challenge. I caught the bar, sat, and let the weight settle. We weren’t whole—Rodriguez’s bunk was empty, Alder’s laugh was gone, Imran’s roar silenced—but we were here. Eleven of us, breathing, breaking, holding on.


“Any word on Yaz?” Ripley asked, pausing the footage. His voice was steady, but his knuckles whitened on the pad.


“Balan’s with her,” I said, throat tight. “Surgery. they said it'll be a few hours.” I didn’t add that I’d punched a medic to keep her close—I didn’t need to. They’d seen it all out there.


Yaki shifted, rifle clinking. “She’s tough. She’ll pull through.” It wasn’t hope—just fact, the kind we’d learned to lean on.


Finley leaned forward, wiping blood from his sleeve. “And Ainsworth? That bastard’s too old to stay down.”


“Headshot,” I said, staring at my hands. “He’s gone.” The group collectively nodded, they had seen him fall too.


Russeau and the other vampires looked at each other, the look on their faces seeming to communicate an unspoken knowledge. I was too tired to pry into whatever secret they were hiding. It seemed everyone else agreed with me.


“Shit.” Yang growled as she let the nicstick fall from her small lips.


“Our entire command structure, wiped out in one fight.” Taggard sighed, his hands pausing in the process of working the slab of pine.


“What's gonna happen to us?” Yaki asked quietly, eyes locked on her dirty boots.


“Likely they'll fold us into Recon, I don't know what they'll do with our spooky friends.” McGill’s voice was harsh, but everyone could tell he was angry about it.


“Maybe they'll promote from within, give us a bunch of rookies.” Goody's voice was filled with fragile hope.


We all thought about that for a moment. Yang tapped a fresh nicstick against her lips as she thought. Taggard stared off into the distance, as though picturing trying to integrate fresh recruits into our team after this. Russeau snorted dismissively, as though the very idea our unit would ever receive fresh reinforcements was laughable. Filoni smiled sadly and shook his head. The whole group seemed to take the idea with mixed feelings. I couldn't think of anything worse than trying to prepare a fresh set of CDF troops for the nature of ERP and our mission.


“We're fucked, the Ashari are about to flood the world with a fresh wave grown in that damned facility, and we're probably getting shut down.” Ripley was still playing and replaying the footage Rodriguez and the others had died to bring back.
We all held our silence for a moment. It stretched, and I saw the CDF guards ‘protecting’ us grow more uncomfortable. McGill was still twirling his knife in their direction, his stocky frame tensing again. Then, Chen broke the silence.


“Fuck it, we've been fucked since we were born, tell me something new Ripley.” Her laugh was brittle and sad, but it was enough.


Goody tapped the table, resuming his hum, and McGill’s shoulders eased a fraction. We sat there, a battered knot of defiance, piecing ourselves together with nicotine, curses, and half-spoken promises. I’d go to Yaz soon, but for now, this was enough—these eleven, these Defiant Few who’d walked through hell and stumbled out the other side.


I stayed there with them for an hour before I stumbled into my barracks room, pure exhaustion confiscating my balance and motor skills. I collapsed on my bunk and stared for a moment at the otherwise empty room. Rodriguez’s bunk had pieces of comm units, X70 bits, and pieces from various other weapons strewn messily on his mattress. My eyes locked on a small mechanical doll made to look like a sergeant. Rodriguez had crafted it after we got a dressing down from Isthman. If you twisted the spring in the back it would shake its arm and mimic the screaming sergeant. My heart hurt. I glanced at Yasmine’s bunk, wondering if her surgery would be successful, if she would ever fight again, if I would get to see her and apologize.


Sleep took me like a lurking assassin, unknown and undetected. I didn't dream.


I woke to Balan touching my shoulder, his face quietly apologetic.


“She's alive, and out of surgery. Go keep an eye on her, Corporal, I need medical attention and you've had a chance to sleep.” He whispered, wincing when the act of speaking forced the burns on his face to rub against each other.


“Yeah, get yourself checked out.” I ordered as I rose and wiped sleep from my eyes, “And, Balan,”
He turned back as he was leaving the room. Eyes questioning.


“Thank you for looking after her… and me.” I stood and reached out my hand.


“You think because you were a little shit when I first met you, I would let you down?” Balan smiled and his voice was sarcastic.


“I guess I just haven't taken the time to really apologize to you for those first few days.”


He spoke to me for a few minutes, outlining that he had picked up on something weighing me down when I first got here. He told me that was the reason he hadn't treated me the way I treated him. Then he left quietly when the pain became too much for our conversation to continue. I made my way to the hospital. After asking a few of the hospital staff, I found Yasmine’s room. She was still unconscious. Doctors said it would be a few days before they might expect her to wake up.


I sank into the chair beside her, the neuro-disruptor held on my lap—her blade, still streaked with white and red. The room smelled like antiseptic and rust, and her chest barely moved under the tubes. Balan had told me she was alive, that she’d pull through, but all I could hear was silence where her voice should’ve been. I stared at her—freckles, cracked lips, that damn stubborn jaw—and it all came loose.


“Yaz, I—I fucked up. Marcus—he went down, and I couldn’t stop it. I see it every night, that hole in his chest, him choking on his own blood. You were right to ditch me after. I figured you hated me for it, blamed me for not being enough. Had to, right? I’d blame me.” My voice cracked, hands gripping the blade ‘til my knuckles went white. “I don’t even know why you came back—transferred in, stuck with me. Thought maybe you were keeping an eye on me, waiting for me to screw up again. And that shard—God, why’d you do it? Jump in front like that? I don’t get it.”


I swallowed hard, the words burning up my throat. “I’ve been faking it, you know? Acting like I’ve got it together so you and Rodriguez wouldn’t see I’m a mess. Lost my edge the day Marcus died, but I couldn’t let you know. Kept you close ‘cause—hell, if it came down to it, I’d take the hit. Not you. Never you. But I didn’t know what I was doing, just pretending ‘til it stuck. And now—Rodriguez is gone, you’re here like this, and I’m still too damn blind to figure you out.”


My eyes stung, and I swiped at them with a shaky hand, staring at her still face. “I thought you saw a failure. Maybe you did. I don’t know why you’re still here, Yaz. I don’t know why you stick with me.”

I generally eat a larger meal Friday night, have 24oz of coffee in the morning, no breakfast and then set out for a 50+ mile group ride. It takes a few miles to get to the meet up, so the actual ride is around 44 miles. 

Intensity of the ride is medium to high (for me). Avg speed 20+, easily have bouts where my HR is 180+ (max 192). Over the course of the 2+ hour ride I might be in Z4/Z5 for around 1 hr and Z3 for 1 hr. 

My fueling strategy is basic to say the least.

2x 24oz bottles with 2 scoops of Gatorade per bottle. 

Ignoring the 8 or so miles to the meeting point. I start to consume the first bottle around mile 15 or the 40 minute mark. The first bottle is finished usually by mile 24 or the 1 hr 11 min mark. For the last hour, of the ride I can get through almost all of the second bottle. There is usually maybe less than 1/4 of fluid left. 

Based on everything I read. People are guzzling down fluids with 60-90 grams of carbs. My Gatorade only gives me 44grams per bottle.

I assume I'm leaving performance on the table by not having my carbs in my drink. I ordered ""Now Carbo Gain"" from Amazon.

Should I also be adding table salt into my bottle? Like table salt?

Generally I feel OK when reaching the end. Occasionally I might encounter cramping, but I don't really think this is a hydration issue. I suspect I'm just getting use to going harder because over the weeks the niggles of cramps have reduced significantly; riding through the cramp is generally not a problem.

👋 Hey there! I’m a 31-year-old entrepreneur (running my own biz with *way* too much caffeine) currently based in the UAE but open to **globetrotting souls** anywhere! Equal parts nerd, fitness junkie, and hopeless romantic, I’m here to find a **serious, lifelong connection** — someone who’s ready to build a future as bold as our bucket lists.

**Passion Projects:**  
🐾 **Professional Pet Cuddler** – My furry crew and I are always down for adventures (park hikes, beach days, or couch marathons with popcorn).  
🤖 **Robot Tinkerer** – I build tiny robot overlords in my spare time (they’re still in training… please don’t tell Skynet).  
🎸 **Guitar Newbie** – Fair warning: My skills are *below* “campfire serenade” level, but I’ll charm you with my rendition of *Wonderwall*… or at least make you laugh!

**What Lights Me Up:**

* **Family First** – Sunday dinners and inside jokes with loved ones are my non-negotiables.
* **Globetrotting** – From hidden UAE deserts to anime conventions, let’s collect stories (and passport stamps!) together!
* **Gym & Nature** – You’ll find me lifting weights or chasing sunsets (bonus points if you’re down for both!).

**Looking For:**  
💞 A **radiant woman from 18 to-mid 20s** who’s:

* **Family-oriented** and ready for deep talks over deeper coffee (or karak chai, if you’re local!).
* **Curious & playful** – Whether we’re gaming, geeking out over anime, or debating the best travel snacks.
* **Active lifestyle** – Let’s crush workouts, then crush pizza guilt-free! 🍕

**Chemistry Notes:**  
✨ While a genuine, **forever-ready connection** is my #1 priority, I tend to find pale skin and blonde hair to be the most attractive traits. I’m also into people who love staying active (think sunshine smiles and trail-ready sneakers! 🌞). But if we click? All checkboxes go out the window.

**Let’s Build Something Epic:**  
If you’re ready for lazy Sundays, spontaneous road trips, and a **serious, long-term partnership** that feels like your favorite rom-com (minus the cheesy dialogue… maybe), slide into my DMs! Distance is no barrier — let’s swap pet pics, weird hobbies, and see if we’re the missing puzzle piece in each other’s lives. 🚀",1,1744635462.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
1jyy7nz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1jyy7nz/had_a_huge_realization_these_last_few_weeks/,Had a huge realization these last few weeks.,"I have been a heavy alcohol user since I was about 20 (I am 30F now) and never went any prolonged period of time without it. At first it was strictly social, but the last few years it has been several times a week, and very heavy on the weekends, saving Sundays to rot in bed and recover for the work week.

After multiple embarrassments, breaking my arm (twice), and unbearable hangovers / anxiety, I finally decided to try Dry January, and I haven't been the same since. I drank a few times after Dry January and realized I can't moderate. I am a binge drinker and every time I drink, I want it to be a party, all night, even if I am just by myself  or with my husband. I never even considered anything wrong with what I was doing, I have a successful career, am financially stable, and maintain good relationships - but all of that was slowly crumbling and I didn't even realize it.

Being sober at first seemed like a chore. I didn't have the right mindset. I dreaded social situations and any event where there would be alcohol around, knowing that I would be surrounded with temptation and it would ""ruin"" my time. I avoided outings with friends a lot at first, knowing that I had no problem abstaining if I was just at home in my bubble.

But something clicked a few weeks ago, and I decided I was going to start going out again, and not let my lack of drinking poison decide if I was going to have a good time or not. I have hung out with friends completely sober, and had a great time. I have been to bars and had a great time. I went to a wedding sober and danced and goofed around to the point where people thought I was drunk with them.

When I stopped trying so hard, I stopped even *wanting* to drink. I finally noticed how much better I feel, how much energy I have, I lost 10 pounds, my skin is clear, and I don't feel like absolute trash. I wake up at 5am on the weekends and have coffee and start my day. I look forward to challenging myself at every social situation to experience it sober for the first time. It is exhilarating.

Watching other people drink (especially at this wedding I went to - there was an open bar and people went crazy) and watching them slowly lose inhibitions, talk loudly, repeat themselves, and begin stumbling / and eventually become completely intoxicated and not even remember anything the next day, is extremely eye opening. I woke up the next day after the wedding and felt amazing and enjoyed the beautiful morning in the mountains while everyone else slept until check-out and feel the reproductions of their actions the night before.

That used to be me. But not anymore.

People will make it very hard on you. They will see you order a Seltzer water with lime, and ask why. ""Are you pregnant? Are you on meds? ""What's wrong""? It is insanity why we have to explain why we don't want to drink poison. I have contemplated the answers to these questions and stopped over explaining myself. ""I just don't *feel* like it"" is what I say now, and that usually shuts them up for a bit. A close friend of mine who drinks heavily even responded with ""Oh well when you start back again we will have a great time, don't worry, we will get you there"". And it made me sick to my stomach. I am sad for her, because she doesn't get it.

On the other hand, a few of my friends hopped on the sober train after seeing me enjoy myself without it. And they are doing great. I love that I could be an example of escaping this prison that we are all doomed to due to our society. My husband is still drinking occasionally, but he said he envied me and wants to be where I am at. If he doesn't that's okay too. It is truly very difficult. But being a good example of sobriety and continuing to have fun,  be silly, and genuinely enjoy yourself is very important for others to catch on.

I am officially free. Free to do whatever I want to without a crutch. I am comfortable doing anything now without drinking. A few weeks ago I would have told you that I am not bought in to being done forever, and that I will probably have some drinks on a special occasion, on vacation, etc. But now I think I am done. I don't want to spend my vacations drunk and not remember it. I don't want to spend the holidays trashed and not remember these special times with my family. I can enjoy them the same, if not more fun without it. And every social situation I experience without it solidifies my decision, and I am, for the first time in my entire life, excited to be sober.

1. **It’s a generic template clone.** If your portfolio looks like the first search result on “free dev portfolio template,” it blends into the background. Clients and recruiters can tell.
2. **I'm afraid I don't have a clear** ***what-you-do*** **message.** ""Hi, I'm John. I love clean code and coffee."" Cool, but... what do you *do*? What problems do you solve?
3. **Too focused on YOU, not your audience.** Your portfolio should speak to *the person hiring you*. What value do you bring *them*?
4. **Too many projects, not enough** ***context*****.** Listing 6 half-baked projects with no explanation is worse than showing 2 solid ones with clear goals, tools, challenges, and outcomes.
5. **Zero personality or story.** Portfolios don’t need to be boring. Add *some* flavor. Even a short story about how you solved a tricky problem shows you're human and resourceful.

# How to Fix It:

1. **Clarity over cleverness.** You should immediately tell people what you offer. Something like: *“I build fast, SEO-optimized websites for SaaS startups.”*
2. **Show process, not just results.** Don’t just say, “Built a to-do app.” Instead: “Built a full-stack app using React + Firebase to learn auth and CRUD flows.”
3. **Include real-world problem-solving.** Even if it's freelance, a client project, or your startup idea, show how you took something from idea to launch.
4. **Make it scannable.** Use sections: About, Projects, Services (if applicable), Contact. Don't make people scroll endlessly to find a contact form.
5. **Mobile-first and performance-checked.** If you're showing off web dev skills, your site better be snappy and mobile-friendly. Test with Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights.",2,1744634935.0,webdevelopment,0,0.75,False

1jyy05k,https://i.redd.it/yi22tyl3rsue1.jpeg,Motorized my handgrinder,"I 3d printed a mount for my hand grinder. Enjoy good espresso but can't afford a very expensive grinder. So I got the kingrinder p2 based off of the James Hoffman video (I'm sure a lot of people did based on it being sold out) but I also like medium roast but it's not easy to grind by hand and takes some time. And this is just sucks especially when I make a cup for me and my wife when we wake up. And I'll have a cup or two more through the day and into the night. So instead of struggling through hand grinding or making my drill a permanent addition to my coffee station. I found these files for my 3d printer. I made a slight modification for a toggle switch rather than  densolder a power supply and put it back together. I found that rather intimidating myself. So I made it that even someone with an elementary level understanding of circuits and no desire to de and re solder a board can make. You just clip the end of the power supply and wire the red and black wires to the toggle switch and to the motor and your done! I glued the switch in place but it would probably stay just with pressure as it's a tight fit. I also just glued the power brick inside the grinder housing and routed the cable out of the space in the back where the power supply was intended to go. Cost me an extra $100 in hardware but if I get a nicer hand grinder I can easily swap it out and still not have to grind by hand. I also didn't use the shaft assembly he suggested as I didn't like a plastic piece with really any torsion force applied to it that's made with layers that can shear very easily. So I cut a 8mm hand crank tool into a shaft. and just connected the motor to the shaft with a 10mm to 8mm coupling. And finished it off with a 6mm 12 point bit to attached to the grinder.

I love worms too. I'm just an invertebrate fan in general, so when I made a terrarium with \*a. nasatum\* and worms from my garden, I was so happy to watch them live their happy lives on my desk, allowing me into their lives while I work. It has led to me learning a \*lot\* about them, the nitrogen soil cycle, different types of soils, different types of creatures, etc etc etc. Essentially keeping them has widened my understanding of the natural cycle of life. 

So learning that my little friends were making soil humus made me ecstatic. 

I've noticed my terrarium slowly filling up with frass/casings/humus from all the different foods I've given them. I like to give them an equal mix of browned leaves and aged pinecones from my garden, where they came from, and vegetable/fruit scraps from cooking. I've also occasionally sprinkled in some yeast for the springtail stow-aways. :)

I took a sample of the first three inches of the soil in one area, and replaced it with old straw and coffee grounds (they are now gorging themselves lol) I spread that soil on a ginger root I had in a pot which I had been painstakingly trying to baby and grow the last few months. Every time I'd dust off the top bit of soil, the ginger looked like it did the day I brought it back from the grocery store. No matter what I did: heat, humidity, water, light... it would just stare back at me like :I every time I'd peek at it.

Not three days after I spread that stuff on the root, I found a nice, happy little ginger shoot sprouting a couple millimeters above the soil. It's been a week since I put it on, and the shoot is now an inch long and turning green. Not only that, but a moon flower seed, which I had forgotten I had put in there from \*last season\*  was sprouting.

Both the moon flower and the ginger have been planted in the garden, and the best part is that when I had pulled the root out of the pot for transfer, I had come to find it was sending out at least five new roots with a million root hairs. I buried it with the soil humus I had previously extracted.

I've now decided that while I love my compost pile outside and will continue to use it, I think I will also now invest in creating more of this magic soil, and see if I can reproduce the same results again.",1,1744634622.0,gardening,0,1.0,False

# Bella Pro Series Espresso Machine (2025): Is It Worth It? - review & Alternatives

Are you dreaming of crafting cafe-quality espresso drinks in the comfort of your home? The Bella Pro Series espresso machine line aims to make that dream a reality, offering what appears to be an accessible entry point into the world of home espresso brewing. But with so manny options on the market, especially in the competitive sub-$500 category, a crucial question arises: Is the Bella Pro Series espresso machine truly worth the investment? This in-depth review will examine the machine's features, performance, and value proposition, providing you with the insights you need to make an informed decision. We'll also explore some alternatives for different needs and budgets.

[[Explore Top Rated bella pro series espresso machine on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=bella pro series espresso machine)
## Understanding the Bella Pro Series Appeal

The Bella Pro Series coffee machine targets a broad audience.It's designed to attract everyone from budding home baristas taking their first steps beyond drip coffee to budget-conscious espresso enthusiasts seeking an affordable choice to more expensive brands. Some small office and startup owners might also consider it as a cost-effective way to offer employees decent coffee.Essentially, the Bella Pro Series promises a semi-automatic espresso machine experience without breaking the bank.

One of the main selling points often highlighted is its potential as an entry-level espresso machine. The models typically advertise features such as a high-pressure pump (often 15 or 20 bars), a milk frother, and programmable shot volumes.The availability of pressurized and non-pressurized filters further suggests a degree of flexibility for different skill levels and coffee preferences.But does the reality live up to the hype?

[[Explore Top Rated bella pro series espresso machine on amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=bella pro series espresso machine)
## Deep Dive into Features and Performance

Before diving into a detailed assessment, it's important to note that the ""Bella pro Series"" encompasses several different models. This review will focus on the line generally, but be aware that specific features and performance may vary between individual machines.

**Key Features:**

*   **Pump Pressure:** Many Bella Pro Series models boast a 15 or 20-bar pump. While high pressure is essential for proper espresso extraction, the pump's *consistency* and *actual* sustained pressure during brewing are critical. Some cheaper machines might advertise high pressure but fail to maintain it throughout the extraction process, resulting in weak or sour espresso.
*   **Milk Frother:** A built-in milk frother is a standard feature. The quality of the frother, however, varies. Some models include a commercial-style steam wand with a 360-degree swivel, allowing for better control and microfoam creation, ideal for latte art. Others might have a simpler frothing wand that produces acceptable, but less refined, foam.
*   **Portafilter:** The portafilter is the component that holds the ground coffee. Bella Pro Series espresso makers often include both pressurized and non-pressurized portafilter baskets. Pressurized baskets are more forgiving and produce a crema-like foam even with less-than-perfect tamping or grind size. Non-pressurized baskets require more skill to achieve good results but offer a purer espresso flavor.
*   **Programmable Shots:** The ability to program shot volumes allows for consistent espresso production. This is a useful feature for those who want to pull consistent doubles or ristrettos without having to manually time the extraction.
*   **Water Tank Capacity:** water tank capacity is an critically important consideration, especially for users who plan to make multiple drinks. Check the specifications to ensure it meets your needs.*   **Cleaning and Maintenance:** Ease of cleaning and maintenance is crucial for the longevity of any appliance. A removable drip tray, dishwasher-safe components, and readily available replacement parts are all desirable features. Regular descaling is also vital to prevent mineral buildup and maintain optimal performance.

**Performance:**

The actual performance of a Bella Pro Series espresso machine largely depends on the user's skill and the quality of the coffee beans. With properly ground coffee and correct tamping technique,it *is* possible to brew decent espresso with these machines.However, they often lack the temperature stability and precise control of more expensive models.This means that the temperature might fluctuate during brewing, leading to inconsistent espresso shots.Similarly, precise control over water temperature is often lacking, making it challenging to fine-tune the extraction for different coffee bean types.

The milk frother,while functional,might not produce the same velvety microfoam as higher-end machines. Achieving latte-art-worthy foam might require some practice and possibly upgrading the frothing pitcher.

## Potential Issues and Troubleshooting

Like any appliance, the Bella Pro Series espresso machine can experience issues. Common problems include:

*   **Low brewing pressure:** This can be caused by a clogged pump, insufficient water in the tank, or improperly tamped coffee.
*   **Water leaks:** Check for leaks around the portafilter, water tank, and steam wand. Ensure all components are properly sealed and tightened.
*   **Inconsistent espresso shots:** This can be due to variations in grind size, tamping pressure, or water temperature.
*   **Milk frother not working:** Check for clogs in the steam wand and ensure the machine has sufficient water.

For these issues, consult the Bella Pro manual. Look for bella Pro Series parts for replacement if needed, though the longevity of the parts might be a concern compared to more durable, higher-end models. Many times online searches can help with Bella Pro Series troubleshooting.

It's worth noting that some users have reported issues with the machine's durability, particularly the plastic components. while proper maintenance and careful handling can extend its lifespan,it might not be as robust as more expensive,all-metal machines. Bella Pro Series cleaning is also key to keeping the machine running smoothly and for a longer amount of time.

## Is the Bella Pro Series Worth It? Weighing the Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

*   **Affordable price point:** The primary advantage is the relatively low cost, making it accessible to budget-conscious consumers.
*   **Ease of use:** Designed for beginners,the machine is generally straightforward to operate.
*   **compact size:** Its smaller footprint makes it suitable for kitchens with limited counter space.
*   **Built-in milk frother:** Convenient for making lattes and cappuccinos.**Cons:**

*   **Questionable durability:** Plastic components might limit its lifespan.
*   **Inconsistent temperature:** Can led to variations in espresso quality.*   **Limited control:** Lacks the precise control over temperature and pressure offered by higher-end machines.
*   **Milk frother quality:** May not produce the same velvety microfoam as more expensive machines.Ultimately, whether the Bella Pro Series espresso machine is ""worth it"" depends on your individual needs and expectations.If you're a beginner looking for an affordable way to explore the world of home espresso, and you're willing to accept some limitations in terms of performance and durability, it might be a reasonable option. However,if you're a serious espresso enthusiast seeking consistently high-quality results and long-term reliability,you might be better off investing in a more expensive machine.

## Alternatives to the Bella Pro Series: Exploring Your Options

If the Bella Pro Series doesn't quite meet your needs, here are some alternative espresso machines to consider:

*   **Breville/Sage Bambino Plus:** A popular choice for beginners, offering automatic milk frothing and decent espresso quality at a slightly higher price point.
*   **Gaggia Classic Pro:** A more customary semi-automatic machine that requires more skill but offers greater control over the brewing process and produces excellent espresso. Known for its durability and modding community.
*   **De'Longhi Dedica EC680M:** Another compact and affordable option,but with a focus on ease of use and automatic features.
*   **Used Higher-End Machines:** Consider looking for used espresso machines from reputable brands like Rancilio or la Pavoni. You might find a higher-quality machine at a comparable price to a new Bella Pro Series.

For small office and startup owners, consider evaluating the number of espresso drinks you expect to serve each day. If the volume is low, the Bella Pro Series might suffice as a very basic and cheap option. Otherwise, consider investing in a more robust machine designed for light commercial use.

Furthermore, when comparing the bella Pro Series vs [competitor], carefully consider factors such as build quality, warranty, and available customer support.

## Conclusion: Making the Right Choice for Your Espresso Journey

The Bella Pro Series espresso machine occupies a specific niche in the market: affordable entry-level espresso machines. While it offers a convenient and budget-amiable way to start brewing espresso at home, it's important to be aware of its limitations. By understanding its features, performance, potential issues, and available alternatives, you can make an informed decision that aligns with your individual needs, budget, and espresso aspirations. Remember to prioritize proper maintenance, use quality coffee beans, and dedicate time to learning the art of espresso brewing to maximize your enjoyment, regardless of the machine you choose. If you are on a strict budget, be on the lookout for deals and discounts to make it more worthwhile. Finding the best espresso machine under $500, also ensures you have done your research and found high quality with affordability.

[Slow Burn/Romance/Thriller/Heartbreak]","Dr. Spencer Reid isn’t one for labels. And neither is she.

Evelina “Evie” Apollo is chaos wrapped in a CIA badge—fiery red curls, sharp blue eyes, and a habit of disappearing for weeks at a time with only a coded voicemail to prove she’s still breathing. She and Reid never defined what they were. They had dinners, they had nights. Mornings with burnt toast and quiet smiles. It was easy, effortless—until it wasn’t.

Until the day Reid received a sealed envelope in the middle of the BAU bullpen. No return address. Inside: a sonogram.

She hadn’t told him she was pregnant. Maybe she didn’t know. But someone else did.

And just like that, she was gone.

Her car: abandoned in the Quantico parking garage. Engine running. Driver’s side door open. A streak of blood on the steering wheel. No Evie.

Now the team is scrambling. Reid’s in front of the whiteboard, hands shaking, scribbling down everything he knows about her—her routines, her fears, her tells. Her twin brother, Adam Apollo—ex-military, off-grid, temper like a lit fuse. Parents? Completely redacted. Her whole file might as well be a ghost story.

But to Reid, she’s real. She’s his. And the team’s about to find out just how far he’ll go to get her back.

Because this isn’t just another missing persons case. This is personal.

And in the world of espionage, nothing is ever simple. No one disappears without a reason.

Sample text (something to give you an idea of what I am looking for):

INT. BAU BULLPEN – 09:45 AM

The morning was unremarkable until it wasn’t.

Spencer Reid approached his desk with his head somewhere else—caught in the soft memory of Evie Apollo’s lips against his cheek that morning, the way her hand lingered on his shirt like she didn’t want to let go. It had been a good morning. They’d talked about names last night. Hypotheticals. Dreams. The future.

She was hopeful.

He was terrified.

And then he saw it: a plain envelope on his desk, labeled in her handwriting. No postage. No markings.

He opened it.

Inside: a sonogram. Black and white. Fresh.

Dated this morning.

Everything else stopped.

His brain stuttered. This wasn’t how she would tell him. Not like this. He grabbed the envelope and ran. She should be nearby. 

⸻

INT. QUANTICO PARKING GARAGE – MOMENTS LATER

Evie’s car sat idling near the rear exit, almost hidden by concrete columns. The door ajar. The engine still running.

Blood on the steering wheel.

Not enough to scream fatal—but enough to twist something in Reid’s chest.

She wasn’t here.

She was gone.

⸻

INT. BAU CONFERENCE ROOM – MINUTES LATER

The door burst open, slamming against the wall.

“Reid?” Hotch stood first, but Spencer blew past him, moving to the whiteboard like a man possessed.

He pulled the cap off a marker and began scribbling.

REID (to himself, pacing as he writes)
“She was here. She had to be. She left this. She left this for me.”

	•	Blood: minimal, steering wheel

	•	No witnesses

REID (rambling now)
“She made it to the appointment. But why come here? Why not call? Why not tell me? Unless… unless she didn’t come. Unless someone brought it.”

MORGAN
“Brought what, Reid? What’s going on?”

Reid tossed the sonogram on the table. His fingers were shaking.

REID
“She’s pregnant.”

A beat.

JJ (blinking)
“I’m sorry—who is she?”

REID (softly)
“My girlfriend.”

The silence was instant and deafening.

No one knew what to say. Reid had never mentioned anyone. Ever.

He turned back to the board, uncapping another marker.

TIMELINE – LAST 7 DAYS
	•	Monday: Stayed over. She made coffee. Took her prenatal vitamin.
	•	Tuesday: Talked about names. Told me she had “a feeling.”
	•	Wednesday: Dinner. She got sick. Blamed it on nerves.
	•	Thursday: Quiet. Distant. Said she was worried about something “unofficial.”
	•	Friday: Brother tried calling. She ignored it.
	•	Sunday: She said, “Tomorrow’s going to change everything.”
	•	Monday (Today):
	•	06:30 AM – Woke up together
	•	07:15 AM – I left for work
	•	08:20 AM – Sonogram timestamp

REID (thinking aloud, racing through thoughts)
“She never told me the result. She left this on my desk. That means she came here. Unless she didn’t. Which means someone else did. Which means—”

HOTCH
“Reid, slow down.”

REID (snapping)
“I can’t slow down, Hotch, she’s missing. She’s not answering her phone, her car’s abandoned, there’s blood, and she’s—she’s pregnant. We’ve been trying.”

EMILY (softly)
“No one even knew you were seeing someone.”

REID (bitterly)
“Exactly.”

GARCIA (over comms)
“Guys… I think you need to see this. Pulling up security footage from this morning now.”

Everyone turned toward the monitor as Garcia patched into the conference room screen.

A feed appeared: the bullpeearlier.

CAMERA: 09:15 AM – ANGLE: Reid’s desk

A man in a gray hoodie and baseball cap steps into frame. No face. He moves fast, doesn’t look around. Slips the envelope onto Reid’s desk. Then he walks out.

GARCIA (nervously)
“I ran facial recognition—nothing. He knew where to go. No badge record. No entry swipe. It’s like he just… appeared.”

ROSSI
“So Evie didn’t bring the sonogram.”

REID (quietly)
“No.”

JJ
“Then who did?”

REID (cold now, calculating)
“Someone who wanted me to see it. Someone who wanted me to know she made it to that appointment… but didn’t make it home.”

He underlined the sonogram timestamp.

REID (muttering)
“It’s a trigger. A message. Someone wants me involved.”

MORGAN
“What about her brother? Adam Apollo?”

REID (pausing)
“Unstable. Former Marine. Off the grid. Showed up six weeks ago unannounced. He hated that we were seeing each other. But this—no. Too quiet. Too clean. If Adam did it, he’d want me to know. He’d confront me.”

HOTCH
“Unless someone wanted us to think it was him.”

The air grew tense.

GARCIA (softly)
“There’s more. Evie’s digital footprint? Wiped. Her phone last pinged thirty minutes ago from a cell tower in Manassas—then it went dark. Like someone killed it with military-grade software.”

REID (furious now)
“She didn’t just disappear. She was taken.”

He underlined her name again, then circled the blood entry. The marker squeaked against the board.

REID (quietly)
“And whoever did this… wanted to make it personal.”

A long pause. The team stood in stunned silence.

JJ (resolute)
“Then it just got personal for all of us.”

MORGAN
“We’re gonna find her, Spence.”

HOTCH (firmly)
“Garcia, I want a list of everyone Evie has had contact with in the past two weeks. Anyone flagged in CIA internal threat lists. Start there.”

ROSSI
“And track the vehicle records. If someone moved her from Quantico, they had to take a road. Look for any anomalies.”

Reid stood frozen, staring at the sonogram.

Her name was still on the board.

She was real. She was loved.

I went back on keto in November and have dropped 37 lbs (178 to 141 lbs, 5’6” male) and would like to cut a little more. The last few are tough.

I discovered IF, so I’m a total newb on it, and have done several 16:8 fasts over the past couple of weeks. My primary goal is to lose a few more pounds but I’m also interested in the other health benefits.

I struggle a bit with the 16:8 because I don’t like black coffee and I get bored with unsweetened tea. I’d love to put some Stevia in the tea or Stevia and half-and-half in the coffee. I read that this breaks the fast due to insulin response and knocks you out of ketosis…

But what if you already are in ketosis? I restrict myself to no more than 20-30 grams of carbs a day, sometimes even less. Is Stevia (or Splenda or whatever) and some half-and-half going to defeat a 16:8 if I’m already in ketosis?",2,1744633652.0,intermittentfasting,5,1.0,False

 It can be the cost of moving around, phone calls, rent, business lunch, unskilled labor or anything related to daily activities that can lead to a profit.

What about the cost of doing business in Libya ? 

Its relatively high; and one reason can be simply attributed to traffic congestion.

It's fair to say that its only possible to conclude one task or errand per day due to traffic.

A trip by car to the bank or any government office will take on average 1 to 2 hours including parking and walking to your final destination - that's if you're lucky not to find some jerk that has parked right behind your car.

The second issue related to traffic is the extent to which a car is abused in terms of wear and tear due to remaining idle for prolonged periods of time.

The other day I was literally stuck within a parking lot with no way out and it was rather evident that anyone trying to move would eventually dent a car or two.  Things got way more interesting when I noticed the ""parking attendant"" jamming different keys into the same car lock in order to move the vehicle.

The point is that it can take a week or 10 working days to ""hopefully"" finish a series of errands that could easily require 1 or 2 days; thus taking a massive toll on one's vehicle and chip away your budget for drinks & snacks on the run.

Next up is the cost of coffee shops and restaurants; a decent  and quiet place for a casual business meeting won't come cheap.  The other day I spent 
30 LYD for practically 2 take away coffees and 2 croissants.
On average I'd budget 60 to 100 LYD for a business coffee including some sort of pastry at a seated location.

Lunch or dinner for two ? It can easily start at 300 to 600 LYD.

Dress code ? If you wanna give a good impression; there's no need to mention that you need to dress for the part. 
Men's clothing in Tripoli comes in 2 categories; its either cheap or expensive - there's no in between and don't get me started on men's footwear.

Laundry ? Personally I make use of laundry shops everywhere I go since I can't be arsed with washing, drying and pressing 😄...but in case anyone is wondering; on average it costs 
3 LYD for any piece of clothing to be washed at most shops.

I'm gonna exclude rent expense for an office space since most people don't need one nowadays but you can expect to pay 2000+ LYD per month for a minimally furnished office - nothing fancy.

Unfurnished office ""hole in the wall"" kinda thing will start at
1000 LYD.

A secretary, receptionist or a coffee boy ? Anywhere from 800 to 1200 LYD depending on working hours.

If we were to translate all these costs into US dollars, it'd come down to peanuts ( except for men's clothing and footwear )  - but how many of us actually earn a living in foreign currency ? 

Exactly.

She has a mad schedule, balancing university with multiple jobs. We weren’t able to meet up again (couldn’t make timings work), but sharing Sleep Token memes and liking one another’s Instagram stories every now and again meant we’ve kept up some minimal contact.

I assumed it was completely over. Too much time had passed. We had ONE DATE. It was nothing to obsess over.

But…I asked how she was doing the other day. We exchanged a few messages. She agreed to meet up for coffee soon. She’s almost finished uni. She’ll have more free time once she finishes her PHD.

I’m trying not to get my hopes up because this could go nowhere, or we could just be friends. 

Still, I haven’t felt this hopeful or excited in a long time. I feel like a giddy teen again. Seeing her reply made my heart pound, and there’s a part of me that hopes she’s interested because agreeing to see one another’s after MONTHS - that must mean that I made an impression. She must have liked me, even if it was as a friend. I might be in with a chance! I’ll just have to see how it goes. Fingers crossed.",2,1744633131.0,actuallesbians,0,1.0,False

In my early 40’s I could drink a cup of coffee in the evening and still fall asleep. Now in my late 40s, I have found that caffeine now keeps me wired and it's impossible to sleep. Thinking about it there have been indications that I am more caffeine-sensitive when I drink my morning coffee and have to monitor how much I drink to avoid the feelings of hyperactivity that are associated with it.

But as someone who doesn’t have friends or a girlfriend and is nearing 30 fast, it sometimes hurts me when I’m in public minding my own business and look around and see so many happy people. Couples kissing, a group of friends sat round a table having coffee, etc. That connection and affection. It’s a foreign concept to me almost, and I often feel like it’s something I’ll never achieve. Making friends and connections also feels like a grind instead of something meant to be fun, since my efforts at putting myself out there have yielded nothing. 

It just seems like all the opportunities I had in front of me during my adolescence and early adulthood/college were right there in front of me but, because I didn’t act on them, they’re behind me now. 

So is there a way to get over this feeling, besides paying out the butt for a therapist to see if they can fix me? Or am I just going to have to make do with being alone? 

ETA: let me be clear that I’m not mad at these aforementioned groups of people. Not covetous or anything like that. It’s just a persistent sense of longing and wanting that can’t seem to be satiated even when I try my best in social settings (Meetup events, specifically). Meetup events tend to bring people who already have their own group of acquaintances or are even dating or married and are just looking for a fun night out (nothing wrong with that obviously). I’ve even tried looking into groups for specific hobbies, even though I don’t have many, like book reading. But all the ones near me are primarily oriented towards women. It just all feels like a grind, as I said. ",1,1744632907.0,AskMenAdvice,14,0.6,False
