Hey, fellow wanderlusters! üåç If you‚Äôre anything like me, the quest for the perfect travel gear seems never-ending. But let me tell you, after jaunting through 50 countries, one item consistently saves the day: the humble portable charger. Here‚Äôs why keeping your devices powered on the go is an absolute game changer, and how to choose a power bank that suits your adventures perfectly!

**Why Portable Chargers Are a Traveler's Best Friend**

Picture this: You‚Äôre capturing the Northern Lights in Norway or navigating the bustling streets of Tokyo, and your phone‚Äôs battery drops to that dreaded red zone. Yikes! üò± A trusty portable charger ensures that your devices‚Äîwhether they‚Äôre phones, cameras, or tablets‚Äîstay powered, so you‚Äôre never left in the lurch when you‚Äôre halfway through documenting a day of epic explorations.

**Choosing the Right Portable Charger For You**

1. **Capacity Matters**: Pay attention to the mAh (milliamp hours); the higher, the better. For extensive adventures, opt for something between 10,000 to 20,000 mAh. This should give most smartphones multiple charges.

2. **Size & Weightü§è**: Nobody wants extra bulk, especially when every ounce matters in your backpack. Find a balance between power capacity and portability.

3. **Fast Charging ‚ö°**: Look for chargers with quick charge technology. It‚Äôll save you precious time, allowing you to juice up during a quick coffee stop.

4. **Multiple Ports**: Charging more than one device at a time can be a lifesaver. Make sure your charger can handle multi-device outputs if you're traveling with more than just your phone.

**Traveler Tips: Make the Most of Your Portable Charger**

- **Charge Overnight**: Plug it in while you sleep to ensure you start the day fully powered.
- **Cables are Key**: Pack an extra charging cable to avoid mishaps when one fails.
- **Stay Charged at Airports**: Use transit time wisely. Plug into airport sockets and conserve your power bank for when you‚Äôre truly off-grid.

**A Personal Anecdote**

One of my all-time favorite travel memories was getting lost in the narrow, maze-like streets of Chefchaouen, Morocco. As evening fell, my phone was my lifeline for maps and calling my travel buddies. The portable charger I had tucked away turned a potentially stressful situation into a seamless adventure‚Äîallowing me to safely navigate back to my riad, music playing, with plenty of battery to spare.

Using a dark to med-dark roast.  16.5gr
I bring down the lever.
I can wait up to 50 seconds for first drops to appear and then when I bring the lever up and let the spring take over, the coffee then comes out too quickly. 34gr out in 16s. 
It surely can't be too coarse a grind otherwise the initial drips would be sooner. 
The tamping is not at high force and so I don't think channelling is the issue, but mustn't be discounted entirely.


Also
If moving to a lighter roast (bear in mind the machine can deliver max 34gr liquid out due to the design) do i dose lower and grind finer and tamp harder but let machine run die full 34gr out?

1iqa0th,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iqa0th/everyone_around_me_acts_like_robots/,Everyone around me acts like robots...,"Hello, r/nosleep; 

I'm currently really paranoid and scared.¬† I don't know who to trust.¬† Up until recently, I had a normal life.¬† I work as a cashier at a local store.¬† I live in an apartment with my mom.¬† She has been helping me pay rent until I can afford to be independent.¬† 

¬†

But 3 weeks ago, something strange happened.¬† I went to a pretty popular cafe after I got off work.¬† I went up to the barista.¬† ‚ÄúCan I just get a black coffee?‚Äù ¬†I said, slightly tired from dealing with customers all day.¬† ‚ÄúOk sir, you can go sit over there, she said overly nicely, like she had rehearsed it 50 times.¬† I didn't say anything else as I walked over to the table.¬† I waited for a bit, looking around the cafe.¬† It was filled to the brim with people talking and sipping their coffee.¬† I normally hate loud environments, but it was actually kinda nice for some reason.¬† The barista came up to me and handed me my coffee.¬† I hope u enjoy it, sir, she said in the same voice as earlier.¬† ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù I said to her as she walked away.¬† I took a couple of sips of my coffee before suddenly, every noise in the cafe just stopped.¬† 

¬†

I put down my cup and looked around, confused and a bit scared.¬† The once-busy cafe was dead silent.¬† The only noise I heard was my own breathing, each breath more panicked than the last.¬† A noise distracted me.¬† A man next to me was writing something on a piece of paper.¬† The squeaking of the marker hitting the paper would normally just be an annoyance but it just made me more scared.¬† ‚ÄúWhat was happening?‚Äù ¬†I thought to myself.¬† After the man finished writing, everyone stood up in unison like a weird cult.¬† Then they just stared at me, not blinking at all...¬† my heart was pounding.¬† I was the most terrified I'd ever been.¬† I looked over and the man was showing me what he had written on the piece of paper: ‚ÄúDon't trust those who speak.¬† We want to help.‚Äù 

¬†

I stood up, knocking over my chair as I ran out of the cafe.¬† As I looked around, everyone around me just stopped what they were doing and stared at me as if I was a creature they had never seen before.¬† I ran through the street, not afraid of possibly being hit by a car, but the people in the cars turned off their engines and stared at me like everyone else.¬† I ran to my apartment.¬† As I went in, I locked the door and then put my bookcase in front of the door.¬† I went into the kitchen, where I saw my mom cooking.¬† 

¬†

‚ÄúWell, hi, she said, smiling.¬† ‚ÄúYou look terrified, and you are sweating.¬† What happened?‚Äù ¬†Even though I wasn't sure she would believe me, I couldn't lie to her.¬† She deserved to know, so I told her the truth.¬† The look on her face was a mixture of confusion and somewhat believing me.¬† ‚ÄúAre you sure that's what you saw?‚Äù ¬†She said.¬† ‚ÄúYes, I promise‚Äù I nodded.¬† ‚ÄúOkay, I believe you.¬† The most likely solution is that it's just a weird flash mob.‚Äù That kinda made sense, but it didn't feel like it was.¬† If it was a flash mob, why would that man write that note? why did everyone do it? Almost everyone I saw did it, so if it was a flash mob, it would have to be a really big one.¬† ‚ÄúOkay, whatever, just don't go outside, okay?‚Äù ¬†I said and she agreed.¬† 

¬†

The rest of the day, I couldn't stop thinking about it.¬† Trying to come up with any explanation that made sense.¬† I barely slept.¬† After I woke up, I was scared to go outside, afraid of those people possibly following me.¬† Looking outside, the city looked really normal.¬† Everyone doing their everyday routines.¬† I said I was sick so that I wouldn't have to go to work for a few days.¬† I tried to reason in my head, but I came to no conclusion.¬† Over the next couple of days, I didn't leave my house.¬† My mother said she didn't experience anything strange when she went shopping.¬† I think she started believing me less.¬† One detail stuck out to me from the encounter: the note, ‚ÄúDon't trust those who speak.¬† We want to help.‚Äù I wondered what exactly it meant.¬† Why shouldn't I trust people who speak? What do they want to help with? After a couple more days inside, I decided to go back outside.¬† 

¬†

As I left the apartment building, I saw my neighbor.¬† I barely spoke to him.¬† He seemed like a loner, so I mostly avoided him.¬† If I remember correctly, he's around 88 years old.¬† I didn't really want to bother him, but I wanted to test if he would do the same thing as the people in the cafe.¬† He was taking a box downstairs which I found weird since he's so old.¬† Shouldn't someone be helping him? I went up to him.¬† ‚ÄúHi‚Äù I said, trying to sound normal, but he didn't respond.¬† Then he dropped the box and turned to me.¬† He stood there a bit as I stared back at him, his face not moving a single muscle, a blank expression on his face.¬† I backed away and ran down the stairs and outside, but before leaving, I looked back.¬† He just went back to carrying the box, walking down the stairs as if nothing happened.¬† 

¬†

I went outside walking through as everyone turned towards me and stared.¬† I noticed that after I left the area, they would just go back to doing the task they were doing before I showed up.¬† It felt creepy.¬† Robotic.¬† As they went back to their tasks, I kept going across the street and finally reached the store.¬† I went in expecting my manager to just stare at me, but he didn't.¬† ‚ÄúHey, you feeling better?‚Äù ¬†he asked calmly.¬† He has always been nice. ¬†He helped make the job a bit more bearable.¬† I stood there for a bit expecting him to turn robotic but he didn't.¬† ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù ¬†he asked with a slightly more concerned tone to his voice.¬† ‚ÄúYeah, I'm fine, sorry, I just kinda zoned out‚Äù I responded.¬† ‚ÄúOkay, so if you feel fine, you can take the cash register over there, he pointed over to my right.¬† ‚ÄúAlright‚Äù I said before starting my work.¬† 

¬†

A family walked over with a shopping cart full of food, but as they came over to me, they all stopped in their tracks.¬† ‚ÄúUhm, are you okay?‚Äù ¬†I asked unsure what to do.¬† I was scared as the family just stared at me.¬† Trying to ignore it, I began scanning the items, but when it came time to pay, they still just stood there.¬† I didn't know what to do.¬† I was freaking out.¬† Everyone I came across except my mom and manager just stopped...¬† I walked away to see what would happen, and the family just returned to normal.¬† The kid asked for a lollipop.¬† The dad refused then paid and left, the mom not saying a single word.¬† It felt...weird.¬† First of all, we don't sell lollipops I would know if we did.¬† And second, the dad, after paying, said ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to no one.¬† After that, I noticed the other customers also staring at me.¬† I went home.¬† 

¬†

While back home, I had even more questions.¬† The dad thanked no one, and the kid asked for an item we didn't sell.¬† I was even more bamboozled.¬† It's like everyone in this city were robots doing the same thing over and over again.¬† Day after day.¬† I went back to work the next day, and the family was there again.¬† Just staring.¬† always staring.¬† It was still unsettling to me, and after I walked away, the exact same thing happened.¬† The kid asked for a lollipop.¬† The dad refused.¬† The dad paid for the food.¬† Thanked no one.¬† Left.¬† The mom did not say a single word.¬† It was the same customers over and over doing the same thing every day.¬† the family came and repeated the cycle.¬† After a while, I got a bit more used to it, but the staring still gave me a weird feeling.¬† I didn't know what was happening.¬† 

¬†

One day, I was sitting in bed thinking about what I could do about the staring people until suddenly, a rock flew at my window, cracking it but not fully breaking it.¬† I immediately looked to see what was going on, and I saw a woman holding a big piece of paper.¬† The sign read, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trust people who speak.¬† They aren't trustworthy and are dangerous.‚Äù I looked at it, unsure what to think.¬† Out of thin air, a police car pulled over.¬† The officers proceeded to arrest her as she tried to escape.¬† Then an officer knocked on my door.¬† ‚ÄúIt's the police.¬† Please open up‚Äù, I heard through my thin wooden door.¬† I decided to open it after some hesitation and convincing from my mom.¬† ‚ÄúHello, sir, you can probably guess what I want to talk to you about, they said.¬† ‚ÄúThe rock that was thrown at my window?‚Äù ¬†‚ÄúYes, is everyone in the house, okay?‚Äù ¬†They said, sounding sincere, but in the back of my head, I was thinking about the signs.¬† About not trusting people who speak.¬† ‚ÄúShould I listen to the cop?‚Äù ¬†I thought to myself.¬† ‚ÄúYes, everyone is fine, I responded.¬† ‚ÄúGlad to hear you are safe.¬† hopefully, it doesn't cost much to repair the window, they answered.¬† ‚ÄúI'll be able to cover it‚Äù I assured them, slightly suspicious.¬† ‚ÄúAll right, well, I'll be going then.‚Äù Before they managed to leave, I managed to ask them, ‚ÄúDo you know why they may have done this?‚Äù ¬†I said, trying to get more information.¬† ‚ÄúThey probably were protesting about something.¬† If you want more information, you can come to the police station tomorrow.‚Äù¬† 

¬†

I had to go.¬† This was the only way to get information on what had been happening, so the next day, I went to the station.¬† I was slightly nervous thinking about what questions to ask and how to not sound suspicious.¬† As I walked in, a woman was talking to an officer at the front desk.¬† A couple more officers talking to each other.¬† Soon, an officer came up to me.¬† ‚ÄúHello, sir, what brings you to the station?‚Äù ¬†As I looked around, I noticed the officers staring at me.¬† It still was uncanny.¬† Their dead eyes staring right through me while they stood there.¬† 

¬†

The officer didn't seem to notice so I pretended to not notice as well.¬† ‚ÄúI, uh, came here to ask about the woman that threw a rock at my window, I said, trying to act natural and ignore the officers staring right at me.¬† ‚ÄúOh sure, come right this way‚Äù they said, not thinking about it a second.¬† As they led me to a different room, they ignored the officers staring at me, Walking in a perfectly straight line.¬† When we arrived, they explained that she was ‚Äúprotesting against the police.‚Äù ¬†I didn't believe them but acted like I did.¬† Trying to maybe get more info from the woman herself, I asked them if I could speak to the woman, but they refused, reasoning that it would be dangerous.¬† Unable to get more information, I decided to go back to my home.¬† 

¬†

I went to talk to my mom ‚ÄúHey, mom?‚Äù ¬†‚ÄúYes?‚Äù ¬†She responded.¬† ‚ÄúSo, I went to the police station-‚Äù Before I could finish my sentence, she interrupted, ‚ÄúOh, that show you like is on.¬† Would you watch it with me?‚Äù ¬†She said as if trying to change the topic. ¬†‚ÄúOkay‚Äù I said, suspicious.¬† I sat down on the sofa next to her.¬† We watched it for a bit, but I still wanted to talk about the woman, waiting for an opportunity to bring it up.¬† ‚ÄúSo mom?‚Äù ¬†I said, trying to naturally start a conversation.¬† ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù ¬†she responded.¬† ‚ÄúThat woman who threw the rock, why do you think she-‚Äù yet again, she interrupted me.¬† ‚ÄúThe protester? Throwing rocks at people's windows for protest is ridiculous.‚Äù¬† I didn't pay attention to the rest of the sentence as I focused on one detail: how did she know she was protesting? I didn't mention that.¬† ‚ÄúMom?‚Äù ¬†I said unsure what to think about that detail.¬† ‚ÄúHow did you know she was protesting?‚Äù ¬†I said, my voice a bit shaky as I trusted my mom less and less.¬† ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù ¬†she responded, not realizing her mistake.¬† ‚ÄúMom, I never said she was protesting, you couldn't have known‚Äù I said, getting up from the sofa and slowly backing away.¬† ‚ÄúI saw it in the newspaper.¬† Calm down‚Äù she said, her voice a mix of stern and worried.¬†

So I‚Äôm about to start Mounjaro at the lowest dose, and currently take lisdexamfetamine (Elvanse) 30mg.

I‚Äôve read online there‚Äôs a chance of a drug interaction and raised heart rate with them. I‚Äôm a little concerned as when I was on concerta 4/5 years ago I had a really bad reaction after being put on 72mg. My resting HR was usually 100bpm but after minor surgery it shot up and wouldn‚Äôt come down so was sitting at between 100-140bpm resting. 

I‚Äôm on a much lower elvanse dose and don‚Äôt notice as much cardio interaction except for when I‚Äôve had coffee, my resting HR is between 65-75bpm on elvanse and I‚Äôm currently incredibly unfit too. I do have POTS but it‚Äôs triggered by lack of sleep + not enough water and is really easily manageable. 

Has anyone had any heart rate interactions? I‚Äôm worried now as I have medical anxiety relating to the issues with the 140bpm resting heart rate so I know I‚Äôm going to be worrying anyway üòÖ

Vyvanse has been life changing! 

It works so well for me and there are no side effects for me.

My doctor put me on Wegovy for weight loss and it's also been amazing, although there are some side effects.

But then I've been struggling with SAD and low libido so we added Wellbutrin. In a lot of ways, I feel like it's been doing exactly what I wanted it to. 
But in other ways, the side effects are so bad now that I don't know if I can keep taking it. 

I know it's probably my own fault because I'm also addicted to caffeine. I only have 1 cup of coffee in the morning but if I have coffee, Vyvanse, and Wellbutrin then I feel so sick! I feel incredibly over stimulated, get a massive headache and feel so tired at the same time and all I can do with my life is sit on my phone. 

I've tried cutting out caffeine and I felt so sick and got the worst migraine of my life. Because of the wegovy, my digestion is slowed down and it takes forever for my meds to kick in so coffee in the morning feels like the only way for me to get up and get moving before noon.

I tried taking just the Wellbutrin and not taking Vyvanse and then I can still be awake but I feel like I have no drive to get anything done. 

I know it's better if I have a good breakfast before taking a medication, But because of the wegovy, I really struggle with making myself have anything more than a protein shake for breakfast but that doesn't cut it for making the meds not interact.

I feel like the answer is probably to just deal with the caffeine withdrawal and get rid of it. But I don't know if I can handle it. I'm also a parent to an almost three year old that is attached to my hip and trying to parent with a migraine is just pure hell. 

I'm tempted to just stop taking the Wellbutrin. 
Spring will be here soon and maybe my sex drive and mood will come back with it? 

I'm almost to my goal weight so maybe in a couple months I can stop taking the Wegovy and then it will be easier to manage the side effects of the Vyvanse and Wellbutrin?",1,1739649958.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

Neutered Male 
Microchipped

Behemoth is still missing. He is a large black and white tuxedo with a thin tail. He has a right ear that is missing a small piece out of it. He has several broken canines easily visible if you are able to look in his mouth. He has white on all his paws. He has a white chin, chest, and belly, but does not have white on his face outside of his whiskers. He is friendly, but may be skittish in an unfamiliar environment. He likes treats and wet food. 

I have searched the area he went missing, as well paths leading to CYM, the local coffee shop he knew as his home. 

He disappeared after breaking through the screen of a cracked window on the second floor of his foster home. His disappearance has been incredibly upsetting to me and many others who love him. 

Behemoth has FIV and dental issues that need to be addressed. The FIV makes him vulnerable to any illness or injury he may sustain. The vet who assessed him strongly advised he remain indoors for the best quality and quantity of life. I am so worried he may be injured from the jump or fall from the second story. 

If you have taken Behemoth in or known someone who has taken and decided to keep him, I just ask you find a way to let me know he is safe, even if it is anonymously. No questions asked. His safety is all that really matters. 

If you are in the area of Summer Creek or ANY area nearby, please keep an eye out for deceased cats that look like Behemoth.   I want to locate him safe and alive, but if that isn‚Äôt possible, I‚Äôd at least like closure. 

Be on the look out for cats matching his description in the Summer Creek Subdivision and all the areas surrounding it, especially paths leading to CYM.

# The Impact of Bitcoin Integration on Your Digital Nomad Experience in El Salvador

El Salvador has become a beacon for digital nomads and remote workers around the world, thanks to its progressive stance on cryptocurrency and the introduction of the Digital Nomad Visa. As one of the first countries to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador offers a unique blend of modern infrastructure, stunning landscapes, and a welcoming community that makes it an ideal destination for those looking to work remotely while exploring new horizons.

# Understanding the Digital Nomad Visa

The Digital Nomad Visa is designed to cater to individuals who wish to live and work in El Salvador for extended periods without the need for constant travel back home. To qualify, applicants must demonstrate proof of income, health insurance, and a stable internet connection, which are essential for maintaining productivity and security while working remotely. Additionally, applicants must show evidence of accommodation for their stay in El Salvador, ensuring they have a comfortable environment to support their work.

# Key Requirements for the Digital Nomad Visa

* **Proof of Income:**¬†Applicants must show a steady income stream, either through employment with a foreign company or self-employment.
* **Health Insurance:**¬†Comprehensive health coverage is mandatory to ensure that nomads are protected during their stay.
* **Stable Internet Connection:**¬†A reliable internet connection is crucial for remote work, and applicants must prove they can access one.
* **Accommodation Proof:**¬†Evidence of a place to stay must be provided, whether it‚Äôs a rental agreement or hotel booking.

# The Bitcoin Advantage

One of the most compelling reasons to choose El Salvador as a digital nomad destination is its embrace of Bitcoin. Since September 2021, Bitcoin has been recognized as legal tender alongside the US dollar. This move has transformed the country's financial landscape, making it easier for digital nomads to manage their finances and conduct transactions without the need for traditional banking systems.

# How Bitcoin Simplifies Financial Transactions

* **No Foreign Exchange Fees:**¬†Using Bitcoin eliminates the need for currency conversion, saving money on exchange fees.
* **Instant Cross-Border Payments:**¬†Bitcoin allows for quick and secure transfers across borders, making it ideal for international freelancers.
* **Lower Transaction Costs:**¬†Bitcoin transactions often come with lower fees compared to traditional banking methods.

# Impact on Daily Life and Work

Integrating Bitcoin into daily life and work significantly enhances the digital nomad experience in El Salvador. From paying bills to receiving payments, the convenience and efficiency of Bitcoin streamline many aspects of remote work. For instance, digital nomads can easily receive client payments in Bitcoin, reducing the time and effort spent on managing multiple bank accounts or dealing with currency conversions.

# Practical Examples of Bitcoin Usage

* **Receiving Payments:**¬†Freelancers can set up Bitcoin wallets to receive payments from clients worldwide.
* **Paying Bills:**¬†Many local businesses now accept Bitcoin, allowing nomads to pay for services and goods seamlessly.
* **Saving Money:**¬†Bitcoin can be used as a savings tool, offering a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations.

# Community and Support

The supportive community in El Salvador plays a crucial role in enhancing the digital nomad experience. Local co-working spaces and meetups provide opportunities for networking and collaboration, fostering a sense of belonging among remote workers. These communities often offer resources and advice on navigating the local cryptocurrency ecosystem, helping newcomers integrate smoothly into the digital nomad lifestyle.

# Benefits of Joining Local Communities

* **Networking Opportunities:**¬†Connecting with other digital nomads and local professionals can lead to new business opportunities.
* **Resource Sharing:**¬†Access to shared resources like high-speed internet, meeting rooms, and event spaces.
* **Cultural Immersion:**¬†Participating in local events and activities provides insight into Salvadoran culture and customs.

# Challenges and Considerations

While El Salvador offers numerous advantages for digital nomads, there are also challenges to consider. The adoption of Bitcoin has led to some volatility in the local economy, and not all businesses may accept cryptocurrency yet. Additionally, the regulatory environment surrounding Bitcoin is still evolving, so it's important for digital nomads to stay informed about any changes that could impact their operations.

# Important Considerations Before Moving

* **Economic Volatility:**¬†Be aware of potential fluctuations in the value of Bitcoin and its impact on your finances.
* **Regulatory Changes:**¬†Stay updated on any regulatory updates that could affect the use of Bitcoin.
* **Technical Skills:**¬†Familiarize yourself with basic Bitcoin management and security practices to protect your assets.

I haven't written in years but I've been kicking around some ideas for extreme horror short fiction lately (mainly inspired by Edward Lee) and finally sat down to pound something out. I hope at least one of you enjoys it =)

**Dick Pills**

**A Tale of Fragile Masculinity**

We all get the emails. ‚ÄúGrow inches now!‚Äù ‚Äú7 inches today‚Äù. We all know what dick pills are and those among us with a modicum of intelligence know all of these emails are scams. Even if you were to actually receive pills in the mail after sending your money to some sketchy website they wouldn‚Äôt do anything. But Richard was starting to feel desperate.

Richard was in a bit of a dry spell. He was mildly charming and had a good enough middle management job, he dressed well and was moderately attractive, only in his early 30s with normal interests and hobbies like watching sports and inoffensive sitcoms. He just didn‚Äôt really draw anyone in. It didn‚Äôt help that the dating world, for those that aren‚Äôt willing to engage with things like book clubs or locally organized social hours, was mostly through apps at this point. Richard wasn‚Äôt even aware of the fact that men comprise a vast majority of the userbase on these apps and that they‚Äôre just an excuse for the single corporation that owns all of these apps to exploit male loneliness for money. So he had made his rounds through the single women in his office and small friend group that were willing to give him a chance. Nothing clicked in a meaningful way and it rarely went past coffee. On the rare occasion he could seem interesting for long enough (without slipping up and saying some dumb shit that was casually misogynistic) to get in bed‚Ä¶ It never happened twice.

The sad fact is that Richard was just plain bad at sex. The laughable clich√© about being unable to find the clitoris was actually true for him. That‚Äôs if he even bothered to look. Foreplay was an afterthought and he was lucky to experience a properly wet pussy. Richard thought it was supposed to feel like sandpaper on his dick. And these poor women never voiced their discomfort or displeasure either out of pity or fear of bruising a male ego. They would tolerate the uncomfortable two minutes he lasted in them, promise to call later, and left him alone in bed to wonder why no one ever spent the night.

Of course, Richard knew he was a gift from God to women. He was kind (to everyone except waitstaff), he was polite (in an overbearing, unasked for chivalrous way), he insisted on paying for dinner (even if this made his date uncomfortable). And he was certain his sex skills were more than fine. So what could possibly be wrong?

Several months of no sex and routinely masturbating to porn featuring the biggest dicks he could find (what heterosexual man doesn‚Äôt love seeing close ups of absolutely massive cocks penetrating every hole possible on a woman‚Äôs body?) Richard became fully convinced that he was alone because his perfectly fine penis was too small to please a woman. Now, to reiterate, this was not his actual problem. His member was completely serviceable. Average in size, and aside from some certified freaks it‚Äôs really more about the motion of the ocean so it could have even been smaller. He just was incapable of realizing how mildly unpleasant and uninteresting he was as a person, and hell would freeze over before he would ever admit he was an actively bad lay. So when a dick pill email got through his spam filters and ended up in his inbox, he opened it.

A few days later Richard received a box in the mail containing a plain white pill bottle. It was completely unlabeled and contained thirty circular white tablets with no markings. Figuring he had nothing to lose, and being stubborn about having spent money on them, he started taking them immediately. Without instructions he figured one pill in the morning each day would suffice. And, surprisingly, they seemed to work. Within a week he noticed just a bit more girth and turgidity in his cock even when it wasn‚Äôt erect. And when he was erect, it felt like a completely new dick in his hand.

The excitement he had for the effectiveness of these pills was short lived, however. They were absolutely working. He wasn‚Äôt sure exactly how these mysterious pills were making the various tissues and fleshy bits in his cock grow, but they were. What the pills were not doing was making his skin around his shaft grow alongside it‚Äôs contents. It started to stretch and become painful. He had to avoid getting erections because of the micro-tears that would develop even without the vigorous jerk-off sessions that would occasionally cause them. So, obviously, he stopped taking the pills. And his cock kept growing. Days after he stopped taking the pills he had developed a nasty case of priapism. Between the bulging erection and the size of growth he had experienced he couldn‚Äôt even leave the house, it was uncomfortable to wear pants so he had called into work for several days. Richard feared seeing a doctor out of shame and embarrassment. There‚Äôs no way he could let another man know he took dick pills. Even worse, what if he ended up with a woman doctor? (See what I mean about the casual misogyny?)

Richard‚Äôs cock was purple. Stretched. Disgusting. His veins looked like those on a body builder‚Äôs arms, as if he had been injecting steroids right into his dick. The skin was taut and frail and on the verge of tearing. And he was terrified. Without pants or underwear on he couldn‚Äôt even effectively hide it from himself and pretend he wasn‚Äôt experiencing this. The intense pain of it wouldn‚Äôt let that happen anyway, but he was fixated on the visual component of this experience. The distress of this was so incredibly massive, all he wanted was to be loved and this is what he gets? An unusable, painful, purple mass draining his blood and energy hanging off of his crotch? And he couldn‚Äôt even experience the simple joy of masturbation. Richard couldn‚Äôt have a good ol‚Äô goon session and enjoy the absolute unit of a dick he finally had.

But he finally succumbed. Days without cumming were too much and he was convinced he could ignore the pain. Using extra lube to be careful not to hurt himself, he pulled up his standard big dick small chick anal gaping porn and went to town. The pain was almost enjoyable and blended with the intense enhanced sensation he was experiencing due to the increased sensitivity and having gone days without doing this. He felt himself getting close and sped up. There was a noticeable ‚Äúwhack whack whack whack‚Äù sound as his hand hit his groin, his hand moving all the way up and down his now 8 inch shaft. And then he came, spraying more thick wet sticky manseed all over himself and the floor than he thought humanly possible. And he, for a moment, felt okay for the first time in days.

Then he looked down.

And there was so much blood.

He had degloved his own cock and the torn, shredded chunk of flesh that used to be the skin protecting his sensitive glans sat in his lap. He screamed louder than he ever had before, the shriek being pulled out of him with such force it tore at his vocal chords and stung his lungs. The pain was unbearable and his manhood now lay before him a fleshy, pulpy mass oozing blood. It mingled with his cum, red and white spilling everywhere. He couldn‚Äôt believe this was happening. He scrambled for his phone to call emergency services and slipped in the puddle, landing on his still swollen, skinless dick. And he heard a pop. The now exposed veins had burst. Blood sprayed across the floor and he could feel himself losing consciousness. He hadn‚Äôt really considered how much blood had moved into his dick over the last few days, too depressed to fully be aware of how anemic he was also feeling. But it was So. Much. Blood. As Richard drifted off, knowing he likely would not wake, all he could think was.

A bobble head / figure of every enemy in the game.

Real walls and roofing made out of metal / Planks so we can build a structure to base in ourselves.



# Stations and Deployable:

Add an option to disable raids in sandbox settings.



# World events:

New weather event where the facility freezes over / is super cold.

A power failure event where the power is off for a few days unless rebooted somewhere.

Create an item like a spawn inhibitor for each type of raid but specifically for raids. (Maybe you have to get this item to craft it by doing a few raids of that type first) maybe like a banner of victory.

Allow us to grow every type of plant we currently cant grow.

A lot of new IS's this for me makes the game really fun.

Add a snapping feature for stuff like crates, barricades, etc. (Allowing us to place them next to each other perfectly)

More farming aspects (Maybe a fish breeding tank or a new type of livestock)

Allow us to turn off the Christmas tree music by interacting with the tree.

Picked up a guy brought him to his first destination just to find out it was closed. I ended up offering him to take him back to their hotel, and they asked if I could take them to another location like this one. We sat for a bit looking for where else one might be. Then we tried calling it, with no response. He said let's risk it and we changed the destination. After arriving that place was also closed. He then asked if I could just take him somewhere to grab some food. After arriving there I wait for 15 minutes for their food to get done (just wanted to be nice). Then I take them back to their hotel. The guy was extremely nice and fun to talk to so I didn't mind. He even bought me a coffee from the restaurant I took him to. Now here's where the wtf uber comes in. Because the area was extremely busy, I'd get a new ride requests when I first pick them up, and when we edit a trip and add a new stops twice. Now because I couldn't pick those people up due to circumstence of my current customer needing to change the trip that shii goes on MY cancelation rate. What's most upsetting is that yes I only got $33 from Uber for this trip, while the customer actually paid over a $100. I contacted support about this and they don't give af.

1iq9kkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1iq9kkb/sudden_loss_in_libido/,Sudden Loss In Libido,"Hello everyone, 

I am not looking for medical advice. Just to see if anyone experienced this before. I am a M (25) and like to say I am fairly healthy. My diet involves around a variety meats, veggies, and fruit. I train hard (mostly power training in the meantime)

3 weeks ago, I had a high libido (normal) and always interested in sex. I‚Äôm usually able to go 2 rounds back with roughly 15 min breaks between each. 1 week ago, I attempted to have sex and it was difficult to get an erection. I still managed to make it work. However, immediately after, I got this sudden loss in libido and some sort of ED. Currently, I am still experiencing some sort of ED (erections not as hard/firm). Has anyone ever experienced this sudden loss in ED. 

What I THINK happened is around the ‚Äú3 week ago‚Äù mark I started taking C4 ultimate preworkout. I do not usually take stimulated preworkout as I know it does tend to decrease my libido (idk why). I immediately stopped it. 

My go to ‚Äúpreworkout‚Äù now is just coffee + L-citrulline (6g) + agmatine sulfate (2g). It‚Äôs been almost 10 days while back on this ‚Äúpreworkout‚Äù and my libido has not recovered and still experiencing some sort of ED. ",1,1739648829.0,Biohackers,3,1.0,False

Before her trip we were intimate with eachother and during her trip she seemed distant. She came back and completely stopped flirting and accepting my jokes for two weeks, she wouldn't engage in intimacy even though she used to need it every day because she was addicted and I enjoyed joking with her flirtatiously. She didn't tell me what was wrong and said she was just overwhelmed, then she told me she put on weight and didn't find herself attractive, which I tried to understand so I didn't force anything and I reassured her she was beautiful despite the weight gain. Before Valentines and our one year anniversary, I found a playlist of folklore songs on her Spotify that were all about cheating, breakups and being unhappy, broken and sad (her previous relationships ended in her getting cheated on). I asked her if she was okay or felt unhappy with me, and she called me insecure and paranoid for asking her about the songs because she claimed to listen to them with her mother, although her songs were all about women. One day later I noticed her female online friend also had a similar playlist with the same name, which I found strange but didn't address because I know these things are normal between friends. 

Yesterday, somehow my girlfriend got a work mission in her homeplace which I found suspicious because her country is very large and she barely gets missions in that village area because the construction work she does is mainly in the city. She sent me pictures of her visiting her aunts and said she was with her colleagues eating cake and having coffee. She went to the graveyard too and paid respects to her dad. I was there for her and supported her emotionally, but got sick and decided to sleep. She returned home after 4 hours and then we facetimed when she complained about getting charged extra money for going to the restaurant (Valentine's Day), but when I asked who she went with she didn't answer and just said ""We"" went there, when I asked about specifics. Eventually, she claimed she was with her 2 engineer friends who are suddenly a couple (Emma) her best friend and (Josh), but from what she told me last week these two weren't dating and only talked. Today my girlfriend sends me photos of her she wants to post on Instagram and I ask who took them for her and she said it was Josh and not Emma. I got suspicious so I looked at Josh and he has been liking all of my girlfriend's posts, while both also like the same soccer team and have similar hobbies.

Yesterday she finally flirted with me and we initiated some intimacy, but she didn't get me any Valentine's gift only a small greeting and speaking to her felt like she didn't even miss out on anything, she didn't have many lovely words and didn't surprise me with anything. We're LDR and I was expecting her to say she wanted to do couple things with me or wanted me to be physically present, but she didn't say any of that and instead we just spent the evening reading books together silently while she told me she loved me and she just said she missed my body.

Today my girlfriend confessed she was having a hard time, and I asked why, we talked about her family and she said she's scared of dying because her dad probably wouldn't accept she's a lesbian. I told her this isn't the case, but it made me think about yesterday, the comment her mother made about wanting her to enjoy Valentine's and the fact my girlfriend went to the restaurant and got charged extra (like a couple) where it wouldn't have happened if she wasn't with that man. It made me think she may have been on a date with Josh and later got guilty today so she indirectly told me she's scared of being a lesbian.

I told her I would support her with her struggles, but mentally I checked out. Am I overreacting or do I have a right to be worried when my girlfriend acts strangely towards me?",2,1739648484.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

1iq9bti,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1iq9bti/things_to_consider_for_first_diy_patio_20_x_30ish/,Things to consider for first DIY patio? (20 x 30-ish ft),"Hi!

We are the owner of a new-construction home, purchased 2-ish years ago. Backyard is bare, only red dirt. No drainage, no sprinkler system, no conduit runs. There are a few weeds here and there but over the past 2-ish years, we have just had to pull a few weeds, otherwise it's remained bare.

We want to have a patio, basically 20ft x 30ft (the shape is similar to a size 4 coffee filter (lol) but with a straight top. It would go in between our house and garage (right by our main service panel, per 811 our patio would not cover any existing utilities thank god).

When we first got the house, we got a quote of about $11,000 for a concrete pad ((which I'm assuming would be higher now)). I wanted to weigh my options with DIY-ing a paver patio as I much prefer the look. We would do the standard red tiles that run like 60 cents. I'd like to do a herringbone pattern.

Both myself and my boyfriend have very limited experience with patio install. I've started doing my research and have gathered some insights but want some further input.

\> will likely rent a plate compactor and wetsaw  
\> considering hiring someone to excavate  
\> need to figure out pitch and drainage  
\> paver panel base vs gravel  
\> consider installing sprinkler system, and empty conduit as to not have a headache later down the line

Any other considerations? Any mistakes or things you wish you knew before DIY-ing your own patio?

Thanks!!!!

1iq98vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParanormalEncounters/comments/1iq98vt/im_back/,I'm back!!,"I haven't posted in a while because, honestly, things have been calm. Empty. My house has felt so empty lately‚Äîlike there's no energy in it other than mine. Until last week.

I live at the mouth of a holler. I grew up here, so I know the rules pretty well. My mother? Not so much.

I have two coonhounds, and the other night‚Äîduring the floods‚Äîone of them was begging to go out. This was around 11 PM. His tracking collar died, and by 2 AM, my mom and I were out looking for him. Now, my mom is superstitious, but she doesn‚Äôt take me seriously when I bring up things like: Never whistle in the woods. If you hear something, no you didn‚Äôt.

Of course, I remind her. And what‚Äôs the first thing she does when we step outside?

Whistles.

We don‚Äôt find him and decide to wait until someone calls. I go to bed.

At around 4 AM, I wake up and start making coffee. I turn around, and suddenly‚Äîsomething feels off. The air is heavy. The house feels different. I feel watched.

Now, our front door is broken, so sometimes it opens on its own. No big deal. But our back door? That one has three locks, and I triple-check them every night.

Both doors were wide open.

I shut them, grab something to protect myself, and scan the house. Nothing.

The day goes on normally. My house isn‚Äôt that old, but it was built badly, so critters sometimes sneak inside the walls. We also have a crawl space under the house, but the drop is so heavy that nothing‚Äînot even a rat‚Äîcould climb onto it.

Two days later, I get home from school. My brother is studying late at a friend‚Äôs, and both my parents are at work. I‚Äôm completely alone.

I go to the freezer to grab a popsicle when‚Äî

CRACK.

Oh shit.

First thought? The floor is collapsing. I freeze. But‚Ä¶ the floor feels sturdy. Next thought? A bear. But it‚Äôs the dead of winter, and there haven‚Äôt been any sightings.

Whatever it is, it sounds big. Heavy. And it‚Äôs coming from beneath me, like something is scratching or straight-up munching on something down there.

I call my parents, and my dad says he‚Äôll check it out. But the entrance to the crawl space has been sealed for months, and when he gets home‚Äîit‚Äôs still intact.

The next night, I pull an all-nighter because I‚Äôm drowning in math homework. At some point, I go to grab another popsicle. As I open the freezer drawer, the stove light flickers. Weird, but maybe the bulb just needs changing.

Then the overhead light flickers.

Shit. The power‚Äôs going out.

Nope. Power‚Äôs fine.

I have this thing where, if anything even remotely seems paranormal, I say: ""Unless you wanna pay rent, get out.""

I messed up.

A cup falls off the counter. A cabinet swings open.

I‚Äôm scared, but I refuse to let this thing get the satisfaction. So I go to bed like nothing happened.

The next night, I actually try to get some sleep. I‚Äôve always been the type to wake up throughout the night, and at around 2 AM‚ÄîI feel it.

Something is watching me.

From the window.

I told my friend about everything, and he said it sounds like a mimic. But I‚Äôm not in danger. It hasn‚Äôt tried to hurt me.

And honestly? If it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it.

I‚Äôm not looking for help‚ÄîI just wanted to share.

Oh, and I almost forgot about last night.

I went outside to grab a cold water off the porch. Now, I hate being outside after dark‚Äîcrackheads, mountain lions, and God knows what else. So, obviously, I bring my dog with me.

The water is only about ten steps away from the door. Easy. I walk over, grab it‚Äî

And my dog sprints to the end of the porch.

He growls. At nothing.

I whip around with my dad‚Äôs hunting light, praying that one of the rabbits just got out. Nope.

Nothing.

Great! I‚Äôm gonna die!

I practically have to drag my dog back inside, and once I do? The lights start flickering around me again.

I told my husband I was going to walk to the store (about .3 miles away) and get some more creamer. He said ‚Äúyou should just go to the coffee shop and go to the store later.‚Äù He‚Äôs a big ‚Äúshould-er‚Äù and for whatever reason this comment annoyed me. Well, I know why it annoyed me, he‚Äôs been making rude comments all throughout the week but this is nothing new. Anyway, I responded with a little annoyance and said something like ‚Äúno I think I‚Äôll just go to the store.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt like my tone and asked me if I thought I had tone when saying this. I admitted that yes, I could see how that had tone and I apologized. And then‚Ä¶he went OFF. And I mean off the fucking rails. Yelling at me (in front of our 2.5 yr old and 5 month old) that he doesn‚Äôt deserve to be talked to that way, asking why I‚Äôm so upset and what my fucking problem is. I apologized again and said I understand how my tone wasn‚Äôt  necessary. 

He never stopped. I told him if he needs to just go off then go ahead. He proceeded to call me a bitch and I asked him not to call me names, especially in front of our children. His response? Then don‚Äôt be a fucking bitch. I told him we no longer need to make plans for the day as I will not be spending it with him. He told me ‚Äúshut the fuck up you fucking bitch.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt help but just laugh (something he has asked me not to do in arguments which I‚Äôve really tried not doing but at this point it had gotten so out of hand I couldn‚Äôt do anything BUT laugh). 

So I bundle up my 2.5 yr old to go walk to the store. We get to the store and I look at my phone in case he‚Äôs sent me a list of anything he needs/wants. And this is the text that I had received. We were seriously gone for 20 minutes. I‚Äôve been home with both kids for the past two days because of schools being closed due to snow and I still had to work (I work from home). Do you know how many times this fool has left without notice after an argument to go golfing, leaving me with our infant while I‚Äôm working? He was doing nothing this morning besides sitting on the couch.

The change he speaks of in the text is me actively no longer putting up with or caring about his bullshit. I‚Äôm done letting his poor behavior trigger me. I have to stop this cycle of madness and it starts now.

So when I was walking down the street yesterday, a  ""friend"" with misophonia whom I was supposed to be meeting for coffee (and who also very well knows I am dyspraxic and have walking issues) yelled at me, screaming that my to quote her lazy walking was hugely triggering her misophonia and that I was also doing this on purpose and deliberately.  I decided to fight back (since I am majorly sick and bloody tired of even people who are friends and family always or at least way too often taking me to task for having motor issues, for blaming me for my dyspraxia, for telling me that being clumsy is somehow my fault etc.) and told her that she knows I have dyspraxia and that her claiming that my walking was being deliberately triggering was nasty and unacceptable and not what a true friend would say (and yes, I did actually also apologise for being triggering but that I was just not willing to take blame for having walking issues and that I was somehow walking clumsily to deliberately bother my ""friend"").

And no, I do not feel at all guilty saying what I said either and if she does not reach out and apologise, well, that is on her and has nothing at all to do with me (and that I am not going to risk slipping etc. while walking because the sound of this might be a trigger, for my safety while walking comes first, and just to say that I also often trigger myself while walking but that is simply how my dyspraxia manifests itself and needs to be accepted not only by me, but by everyone).",2,1739647293.0,dyspraxia,0,1.0,False

Needless to say I was tired and completely drained with all the socialising I had to do. Pertaining to which I boarded the general coach contrary to what I usually would have done. As I alighted the metro I was approached by a guy who said he saw me there and thought I was really pretty. I thanked him with a polite smile thinking this would be it but he asked me for a cup of coffee. Granted he did not seem like a creep and more of an extremely nervous guy embracing himself to utter the words he was saying, I was still unsure if I wanted to, so I politely declined his insistence to which he asked if we could just talk for a few minutes, which I refused as well. After two more failed attempts at refusing, I ended up giving him my instagram handle (he did not follow me and I blocked him afterwards). Now the same thing has happened to me before very recently and I emotionally handled it pretty well then. Coming from an already exhaustive day and having experienced a stalking situation the day before, I immediately broke down right after he left and started crying feeling scared from the sudden intrusion. It took me a day to finally get over the incident. The guy wasn‚Äôt scary at all in his overall demeanour but I still got intimidated by the act. It‚Äôs not been a lot of time since I moved here and having experienced this twice makes me really confused as to how I should be approaching people like such.

1iq8tzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/1iq8tzs/year_long_brain_fog_caused_by_vaporizing_cbd/,Year long brain fog caused by vaporizing CBD isolate,"Brain fog disappeared finally, only to come back roaring harder then ever recently... and I have discovered dabbing CBD isolate was the culprit.

I've been smoking weed/concentrates heavily for 17 years, more then half my life. Never experienced any type of long term brain fog or memory problems.

1 year ago I bought an ounce of 99% pure CBD isolate with intention on supplementing it daily, I was taking tinctures under the lounge as well as vaporizing it via dab rig (about 15 mg per dose). 

After a few weeks I noticed I had the worst brain fog/memory problems of my entire life, couldn't properly form sentences, couldn't think of basic words, was forgetting something someone had just told me. My focus went out the door, couldn't concentrate on anything. Even memorizing a 4 digit number was difficult. 

I felt as if I was living in a haze, completely disconnected from myself. It was horrible. I am an amateur bedroom DJ and i lost all my abilities, my talent. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemies. My friends and family thought I was either becoming brain dead or perma-fried.

I couldn't initially connect the CBD to the brain fog, because I had read so many good things about it (including mental clarity, anxiety relief, medical benefits). I thought it could be my diet, I read the book ""Grain Brain"" and thought I may have Celiac disease, I cut out grains, sugars, carbs... only to get very mild relief. I still eat very healthy and almost never consume processed sugar or junk.

I was a daily coffee drinker and I stopped drinking it to see if I would feel relief, but it felt as if that made it worse, although I do find a tiny sip of coffee can bring mild relief.

My main mission in life became eliminating my brain fog/memory loss. Did much research, spent so much money on supplements. Thinking it could be brain inflammation or oxidative damage. I began taking many antioxidants, natural anti inflammatories, etc. 

During my wedding in Mexico I noticed my brain fog went away substantially after a week of being there. I believe the daily drinking helped (there are professionals such as Dr. Mindy that say alcohol can lower blood glucose spikes, could be the case, hard to say), although I will never except that as a long term solution. Because when I got home after 1 month, my brain fog returned.

1 year later I am still feeling it, I would say the antioxidants help, feel alot better maybe 75% better but still definitely there.

Recently I signed up for 3 Kambo frog medicine detoxification ceremonies that will be taking place in the near future with a licensed professional (I won't get into that here, that's a whole topic on its own, research it, youtube). The first one taking place next week. I really need a heavy metal detox due to working in a shipyard breathing in horrible welding fumes and metal dust daily, as well as a liver cleanse from past alcohol abuse.

The requirements to prep for this ceremony are to eliminate/fast from alcohol, sugar, processed/junk food and caffeine consumption for 1 week prior to the detox. I thought this would be the perfect time to also take a proper break from weed, instagram and porn, as I feel quite addicted to those 3.

I've never gone longer then 4 days without weed since I started 17 years ago. I've never been without dopamine and felt a full dopamine detox to be necessary.

On day 3 of this weed/stimulant fast, my brain fog went away completely. Like 100%. I've never felt so much joy in my life. Although ridden with bad weed withdrawal symptoms (short temper, sleepless nights, stress), my brain felt new again. 

I began to get back into DJing, having a new jumpstart on life felt great. I don't know the exact cause of the brain fog lifting, whether the culprit was daily weed, occasional alcohol benders or overstimulation from social media/porn.

So to help with the weed widthdrawls and insomnia, 2 nights ago I thought it would be a good idea to supplement CBD under the tongue, and eventually vaporizing cbd twice using my dab rig (15mg per hit, 350-420 ¬∞F). It made me calm and relaxed, although it didn't help with my sleep.

The next day my head has a pulsating throbbing feeling, and feel a cloud of fog once again. I am filled with pure regret as I know this could cost me another year of proper brain function. My head feels heavy, inflamed. My short term memory is shot, I couldn't even remember a newly learned 4 digit number at work once again. 

I smoked that CBD 2 days ago, still haven't had any THC for 5 days, and now my head is feeling even worse then ever. I should have known better, I now  realize my suspicions were correct about the CBD isolate dabs causing my brain fog. It was most definitely not THC that caused this.

I feel dumb and forgetful again. My ambitions and hobbies are back on standby as I can't focus whatsoever. My life is back at a standstill.

My next step is to take the antioxidants that I believe helped me initially (PQQ, NAC, as well as electrolytes, vitamin B complex, vitamin C, and L-Tyrosine).

I am praying this Kambo detox will rid me of my brain fog, as it is one of the benefits of the treatment. I will report back if i feel any improvements. My healing journey is not yet over, and I would like to hear peoples feedback or personal experiences. 

I've read of lots on here of people fixing brain fog with CBD, as well as many stories of the opposite, causing them the same brain fog. I know people love to hail CBD as innocent and almost unnoticeable, but maybe everyone's brain chemistry is different and my brain cannot handle smoked CBD like that. I am scared to even try CBD under my tounge anymore. 

Thank you for giving me your time and reading this all, it means alot to me, and I hope to find peace in all of this",2,1739646894.0,BrainFog,0,1.0,False

I thought maybe i have skill issue with tamping and other small stuff so i bought a proper calibrated tamper, a WDT and a puck screen. But the results are somewhat same (although my prep was fast this time). Im still struggling with the ratio. I was using 12g of coffee grind as now, i will try 10g tomorrow and hope for better results. Temperature was auto locked to 90-96 degree celcius i guess. Rest i cannot think of anything else.

1iq8nin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1iq8nin/should_i_attempt_to_salvage_the_friendship/,Should I attempt to salvage the friendship?,"I honestly never thought I would be in this situation but genuinely I am conflicted with what I should do. I had a falling out with some of my friends I made in exchange and I‚Äôm contemplating if I should attempt to talk it out. 

A bit of backstory;

I went to the uk for exchange last year, and that was when I met D, K and Z. I was happy to meet them as we travelled around the city together. D, K and I are from the same country while Z was from a different one. Admittedly during the exchange, I did decline their invitations to hang out because I wanted to focus on my modules which I assumed they would be okay with since they said it was okay. One of the days which, I didn‚Äôt know at the time was K‚Äôs birthday to which I was extremely apologetic for. During this period, during hangouts D and K would always be late. Not 5-10 minutes late. But an hour or two late without any notice, which irked me (and I have brought it up)

Fast forward to end January. Z was coming to our country as a holiday, during the lunar new year period which I celebrate. We had all wanted to meet up which I was excited for. I mentioned to D and K that I would be late for the meet up as I had reunion dinner and family commitments but would join soon after. They were supposed to meet at around 7pm, at around 7:30pm, Z called me saying they were late to which I said yeah they always are, that‚Äôs why I intend to give them an invitation with an hour earlier so they would arrive ‚Äòon time‚Äô. (This comment was made through text). A bit later I joined, I assumed they were finishing up dinner already so I opted to wait outside and shop around, not knowing they were only partially done. As to which one of them ran out to grab me, in hindsight I admit this is weird on my part. 

During the dinner conversation, I tried to make conversation but I don‚Äôt know if it was because I was too soft or what they didn‚Äôt respond to my questions. K did ask me if I was ok and I said I was simply tired from visitations but still wanted to hang out. At this point I knew they had taken Photobooth pictures without me and assumed we were gonna do it again together. But apparently not? We went straight to a jazz bar, and the entire ride when I was sitting in front I felt like I was being left out of conversation to the point the taxi driver asked if we were friends, and I think this was when I checked out of the conversation. At the bar itself, D did ask me if I was okay and tried to include me but I think a combination of tiredness and frustration just made me seem unapproachable. I decided to leave after the bar, citing I had work the next day. 

On the train ride home, I crafted a paragraph and sent it to Z with me saying that I felt excluded in the activities and also apologised from making myself seem distant, admitting that they did try but I was so in my feels I didn‚Äôt respond positively. In hindsight, I REALLY SHOULD HAVE SENT THID AFTER SHE LEFT THE COUNTRY. I sent the same message to D as well. The next morning at 4am, Z responded to my message with an 8 min recording, basically saying that I was negative energy, I brought bad aura and I was the only one at fault and that maybe time apart would be okay. To this I responded that yup that‚Äôs fair, I hope you enjoy your time here and I genuinely thought that was the end of it. It wasn‚Äôt. A few hours later, she sent a screenshot of me saying that D and K were always late to the group chat claiming I was starting shit. And I was genuinely so frustrated I said bye and deleted her number. She claimed she was just being direct and honest, which to me meant you would have brought it up earlier?? A few hours later, I wrote a message to D and K explaining my side and that I didn‚Äôt think me saying they were late was shit talking and that yes I am also to blame. D wrote a message saying that I was selfish for sending that message knowing Z was here a few days. Maybe it‚Äôs a difference in lifestyle, but for me I would like to talk it out and that was what D and K claims they like to do as well. D concluded the statement saying that time apart would be good for now. 


I don‚Äôt know how this blew up so badly because I really wanted to talk this out and thought this could have been discussed like adults. I cannot be bothered with Z anymore because of her sending screenshots painting me as a bad person when I barely even talk to her in the first place. But I liked my friendship with D and K, where we were all supposed to travel together. 

I am thinking of asking D and K out for coffee in mid March and just talk it out, no matter if we remain friends or not in the end. My close friends says it isn‚Äôt worth saving the friendship but my parents are on the side where I should at least try to talk it out. I‚Äôm so conflicted on what to do and if I am actually the negative energy and a blight on the friendship. 

I want to reiterate saying I know I‚Äôm not completely innocent and I am a cause of the issue, but did it warrant such a big blow up?

Guy I met on OLD. We chatted on the phone three days before. Decided that V-day would be fun not like we were doing anything anyway. I had been wanting to try out the new bowling ally in our city.

I get there and almost walk by him because his pics were like ten years younger than he was in person. Black hair was gray (This is LAST time I don't face time first every time I neglect this step this happens).

That ticked me off a bit but I decided to take it in stride.

We played some good games. He was fun. Conversation flowed very well. We ate pizza and talked more. After we left he asked if we could get coffee at a Starbucks across the street. We laughed at all the guys with big bunches of flowers. We had the ""talk about our divorce drama"" discussion.  He had funny OLD stories to share.

While the vibe was good. For me it was not a love match vibe. More this is a friend. He was a bit of a hypochondriac and acted more like 65 than 59 years old. But nice and I enjoyed the evening. He showed me text he sent to his brother that said ""She's here and she's a hottie""  
It was sweet.

At the end of the date. He asked me for a kiss. I hate when men do this on the first date but I appreciate being asked.From my silence he knew something was up and asked ""Are you not into me?""

I responded ""I'm not there yet.""  
He said ""...Ok I can respect that. ""

I went to my car and got in to drive but while we were bowling another car parked close to me and I struggled to get out without bumping the vehicle especially in the snow.. I guess he noticed I was struggling, got out of his car and came over.  He was kind and said ""I'm a pro at parallel parking . I got this."" got in driver's seat of my car and safely maneuvered my car out of the spot.

As he got out of my car and helped me back in the driver's seat, He said now how about a kiss for that?  
He leaned in but I put my head down. He looked disappointed and said ""Oh come on"" and leaned in again. I did the same thing.

When I got home he texted me ""Great V-Day date. You are awesome. Let's do something this week?""

I had a good time but still did not like how he handled the kiss situation.  This is not the first guy to do this. How do you all handle good night kiss situation?  I prefer to hug after the first date rather than kiss but men seem to feel this is a blow off.",19,1739646284.0,datingoverfifty,23,0.91,False

Hey MaximizeMe fam! üéâ Okay, real talk‚Äîwho else starts Monday feeling more like a zombie than a go-getter? üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If you've ever felt like you need a weekend extension just to catch your breath, you're not alone. But what if I told you there‚Äôs a way to use those precious days to actually set yourself up for a killer week?

**Picture this:** It‚Äôs Sunday night, you‚Äôre calmly sipping a cup of herbal tea, and you‚Äôve got this serene ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready‚Äù vibe. The catch? It doesn‚Äôt involve a ridiculously early 5 AM boot camp or a juice cleanse. Let‚Äôs dive into some simple steps to help you unlock your weekend recharge, shall we?

- **Declutter your space**: No, I‚Äôm not suggesting you Marie Kondo your entire house (unless you‚Äôre feeling particularly ambitious). Just clear a bit of chaos. Maybe tackle that desk you‚Äôve neglected all week or the ever-growing stack of laundry. A tidy space can make your mind feel tidy, too. Who knew, right?

- **Reflect and Reset**: Grab a journal or a random napkin‚Äîwhatever floats your boat. Jot down what went well this week and what, well, sucked. Be brutally honest. Once it‚Äôs down on paper, it's easier to plot out some actionable tweaks. Think of it as your personal episode of reality TV, but without the drama.

- **Tech detox**: Bear with me here. I know, the thought of parting with your phone might make you break into a cold sweat. But even just an hour away from screens can feel like a mini vacation for your brain. Trust me, your Instagram feed will still be there later.

- **Plan something to look forward to**: I‚Äôm not talking about booking a trip to Hawaii (unless you can, then by all means, go for it!). Even a simple coffee date with a friend or trying out that new recipe you saved eons ago can do wonders for the soul.

- **Get that heart pumping**: Whether you're a weekend warrior or more of a gentle stroller, just get moving. Maybe it‚Äôs a hike, a bike ride, or just dancing around your living room like nobody‚Äôs watching. Your body‚Äîand your mind‚Äîwill thank you.

Here's a little secret: It‚Äôs all about setting an intention. The weekend isn‚Äôt a buffer between workweeks‚Äîit‚Äôs your launchpad. What‚Äôs one small thing you‚Äôre going to try this weekend to make Monday a breeze?

1iq8c5b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iq8c5b,My current skincare + Review,"Hello lovelies, I‚Äôm  in my early 20s living in hot-humid polluted city! I have (Sub-saharan) Dry-sensitive reactive skin (diagnosed) prone to acne and PIH along with hyperpigmentation (literal patches, gvng me Regency era sideburns). My current routine mostly consists of KB/AB products along with Indian Pharma. Nonetheless, I use these products along with my Rx topicals (don‚Äôt ask what can‚Äôt share). All suggestions n criticisms are welcome. The following products have been used at least 6 months prior to the review.


1. Facewash (COSRX GM LOW PH GEL): Literally my HG for 3yrs now. Lately, especially during winters it‚Äôs a bit drying combined with my topicals so thinking abt shifting to more moisturizing cleanser like Isntree‚Äôs Yam root milk. I occasionally wear makeup it seems to remove it well might require a bit more of a quantity. Doesn‚Äôt sting the eyes neither removes mascara well. No frag.


‚≠êÔ∏èTexture: Clear gel

‚≠êÔ∏èRating: 8/10

‚≠êÔ∏èVerdict: HG/WRP (unless I find something better)

2. Cleansing balm (BANILA Co. OG): This is a saviour for the days I wanna go full glam! Doesn‚Äôt sting my eyes (which is always a plus). Melts the makeup n removes mascara easily. Didn‚Äôt gv me any CCs or acne nor any frag.

‚≠êÔ∏èTexture: Clear waxy petroleum gel type.

‚≠êÔ∏èRating: 9/10

‚≠êÔ∏èVerdict: WRP

3. Face mask (I‚ÄôM FROM GINSENG MASK): It‚Äôs a wash-off mask. No frag n IT IS moisturizing! my skin feels so plump. Since it‚Äôs a wash-off mask incorporates well in my weekly everything shower. It‚Äôs also hydrating n gvs tht slight from within healthy glow. I noticed putting it for 10min. gvs the same results as putting it for an hour or more. Can‚Äôt wait to try their honey variants. Apart from this once in a month I do a diy Besan+honey+coffee (chickpea flour) mask. 

‚≠êÔ∏èTexture: Honey like viscosity.

‚≠êÔ∏èRating:10/10

‚≠êÔ∏èVerdict:WRP

3. Toner (COSRX PROPOLIS SYNERGY): It is hydrating but a but meh. I feel this is an overhyped product for my skin type. I knw JB milks/lotions work better. It‚Äôs light, clear, no frag. all the goodies but performs okayish. I feel the coin sized amount does nothing for my face (my face is small), requires quite an amount. Nevertheless, my mother who‚Äôs an oily combo skin type loves this.

‚≠êÔ∏èTexture: Runny-watery kind, clear but golden yellow in the bottle. 

‚≠êÔ∏èRating: 4/10

‚≠êÔ∏èVerdict: WNRP (Gng back to JB).

4. Essence (COSRX SNAIL MUCIN): Again a HG since 4+yrs now. Actually this introduced me to the world of KB hence the review might be biased. At first it might seem unassuming (like meüåù) but you truly get to knw it‚Äôs worth once it is absent. I love to take a dollop  (4pumps) of it after I shave my face, calms it down n soothes the skin barrier. No frag., doesn‚Äôt sting my eyes. Although, this isn‚Äôt enough for my skin to be moisturized but good enough to keep it hydrated. 

‚≠êÔ∏èTexture: Slimy clear gel like viscosity.

‚≠êÔ∏èRating:9/10

‚≠êÔ∏èVerdict: HG/WRP

5. Serum (REJUSURE POLYGLUTAMIC ACID): Y‚Äôall are honestly sleeping over this, I dunno why it isn‚Äôt talked abt in the beauty community much, but this potent god‚Äôs nectar literally quenches my Sub-saharan skin better than Hyaluronic (My mother loves the Skin1004, Klairs then Torriden, lmk if you want a review). Honestly hyaluronic is good for the time being but it never did much for my skin. The only problem is the pungent smell, if you got sensitive nose this ain‚Äôt for you which even I‚Äôm not a fan of (coming from a girl who loves the smell of petrol). The silver lining is the smell eventually subsides but I‚Äôm open to suggestions for this serum.

‚≠êÔ∏èTexture: Runny watery.

‚≠êÔ∏èRating: 6/10(That god awful smell)

‚≠êÔ∏èVerdict: WRP (dunno any alternative as of now)

6. Night serum (NUMBUZIN PROTEIN SERUM NO.2): Oh there goes my obsession with Ceramide based products (thanks to Reddit). I stumbled upon a very well researched post on Ceramides n the golden ratio of lipids, free fatty acids n cholesterol (good one) which made me include this in my routine. I only use it at night before my meals so it hv the time to sink in well. Just 1 1/2 pumps are sufficient for tht Korean glass-skin like look. No frag n doubles down as moisturizer. What I dislike about this product is the way it sits on top of the skin n takes its sweet tink to actually penetrate. It‚Äôs definitely moisturizing but not hydrating. 

‚≠êÔ∏èTexture: More of an emulsion than serum.

‚≠êÔ∏èRating: 8/10 (Sank sooner/deeper)

‚≠êÔ∏èVerdict: HG/WRP

7. Moisturizer (ORYZA SKIN REPAIR AND RESTORE LOTION): Now, this Indian pharma I absolutely swear by, again Golden ratio based ceramide product. Initially it stung my eyes, claims to hv no frag. but eventually my skin built a resistance against the stinging n now it doesn‚Äôt. Honestly on my second bottle n it‚Äôs a perfect mix of lightweight moisturizer tht gives the Korean glow. Again takes time to sink in skin but faster than the Numbuzin. I‚Äôm open to recc on this product but since I double moisturize it‚Äôs just perfect. 

‚≠êÔ∏èTexture: Runny lotion.

‚≠êÔ∏èRating: 9/10 (Lightweight)

‚≠êÔ∏èVerdict: WRP

9. Spot Corrector (EARTH RHYTHM ON SPOT BLEMISH CONTROL COMPLEX): Honestly the only product which performed way better than the brand claims. I‚Äôve a habbit of scrunching my nose so there‚Äôs a very dark line runs through the middle of the bridge n the tip. This thing (in  a very desperate n heartbroken attempt) was applied mistakenly over Boroline. Next day I noticed the CCs/stubborn whiteheads (which endured multiple physical scrubbing, baking soda n wht not since the time of puberty since puberty) hv significantly shrank. Now I use it thrice a week to keep the CCs on my chin n nose. I feel the magic ingredients are Salicylic acid n Licorice. 

‚≠êÔ∏èTexture: White cloudy gel.

‚≠êÔ∏èRating: 10/10 (Saviour for whiteheads)

‚≠êÔ∏èVerdict: HG/WRP


10. Emollient (BOROLINE): The GOAT, honestly this miracle ointment of a cream has built my skin barrier in one night. ONE FREAKING NIGHT when my skin was at the most vulnerable position, compromised n red. I put 10-15 dots of it all over my face n pat it to lock everything in, DO NOT rub it. It has never given me any CCs or acne till date. 

‚≠êÔ∏èTexture: Thick white cream.

‚≠êÔ∏èRating: 10/10 (Godsent)

‚≠êÔ∏èVerdict: HG/WRP

11.Sunscreen (BEAUTY OF JOSEON Relief Rice probiotic): Honestly in terms of protection it‚Äôs not much but gets the work done. I like it as my winter sunscreen n Indoor one but I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs built for Indian summers. Reapplication for oily skin might be a bit too much. It comes actionable as greasy than the glass skin kinda glowy. I usually pat it rather rubbing it down, doubles down as moisturizer, no frag. It definitely needs more than two finger.

‚≠êÔ∏èTexture: Lightweight Runny off-white liquid.

‚≠êÔ∏èRating: 7/10 (Moisturizing but not protective enough)

‚≠êÔ∏èVerdict: WNRP (for summer)

Lil NOTE: To all the teenage women out there, No you do not need an extensive skincare routine as your fav. influencer, stop wasting your parents hard earned money. Do not use Rx products without consultation, a lifetime of hell isn‚Äôt worth the experimentation. Do not use products not meant for your skin, you‚Äôre creating problems tht doesn‚Äôt exist. You might be desperate for the validation but it‚Äôs not worth it, instead build skills n a personality n a healthy friend circle. Remember, ugly on the inside cannot be cured hence be kind to yourself n others. All you need is a Good Facewash, Moisturizer n sunscreen.

TL;DR- Most of the products reviewed above contains no frag. doesn‚Äôt irritate eyes and is dry dehydrated sensitive-reactive skin (diagnosed) approved. Thanks for the read.

08:19 AM

Yesterday I reached out to Lex Fridman after seeing his post on Instagram. I filled out 2 forms. 1 for podcast potential, and 1 for coffee. I sent him an audio message using the following script \[Paragraph of text below\] It looks like I'll be dream journaling again in an attempt to rediscover myself. Like I've mentioned in the past, it feels like I've done and seen it all. I'm trying to rediscover what drove me so hard to be a racecar driver. Right now, my biggest motivation is fixing this broken world. I can't do it alone however. I'll need the most brilliant minds ever known to humanity.

  
Hello, my name is \[My Name\]. I used to be a technician for Mercedes-Benz of San Juan. I was let go November of 2024 due to my controversial conversations with my co-workers. My controversial conversations lead to massive fear and panic amongst my co-workers that it was in everyone's best interest I no longer participated in the automotive industry in South Texas.

I became convinced that my life is a construct, the same way Eric Weinstein believes Jeffrey Epstein is a construct. Someway somehow, everything leads to me, a construction of something bigger than all of humanity. My story starts with my parents. My parents are immigrants from Mexico, and I still live with them alongside my older sister. My parents & sister are very ignorant with technology & the modern world. They somewhat believe in witchcraft & haunted spirits. So does the majority of South Texas.

I'll first start talking about my father. His father's identity is unknown. His mother was a tyrannical mother. She wanted to control every and all aspects of my father's life. My father resisted & separated from the tyrannical mother. It seems like the entire world is suffering the consequences of my father's separation from his tyrannical mother. The tyrannical mother has passed away several years now. My father works at a graveyard.

I'll now talk about my mother. Her entire family lives in Mexico, she's the only one who lives in the US. She's a SAHM. Her father was a farmer in Mexico who apparently had tons of leverage over Mexico. He has passed away several years ago now. Her mother is still alive, but suffers from Alzheimer's and dementia. She's been a SAHM all her life. My mother's sister is taking care of her. They both live in Mexico. My mother's sister has a government job & is constantly attacked by Narcos & mob-bosses from Mexico. Recently, one of her brother's truck was hit by an IED. Miraculously he survived.

My older sister works as a substitute teacher for the time being. She was very overprotective of me during my younger years. I resisted her overprotection to the point I've resented her. We hardly talk despite living in the same household.

I still live with my parents & older sister due to our low social-economic status. I suppose reaching out to you is a cry for help, but as we all know, a cry for help is a cry for war, and I am very afraid.

In 2001, I was born. I was an intelligent kid, gifted in mathematics. During my 4th & 5th grade years, Duke University recognized my talents, along with certificates of President's Education Awards in 2010 & 2011.

Unfortunately around that time I picked up a job at a golf course with my dad due to our low social-economic background. I couldn't focus much on school, so my academic records started dropping. I never dropped out though, but I started resenting school & did just enough to get me by. Teachers & professors didn't like me. I had potential for much more, but I always held back. I rebelled against academia. They didn't know I was working a part-time job as a middle schooler to help support my family. Working at a golf course, I naturally picked up golf, but I never became good enough to turn pro due to the lack of a proper support group. I played high school golf but quit due to poor coaching & demeaning colleagues.

At the same time, I've always had a passion for motorsports. All my life I wanted to be a racecar driver. I studied anything & everything I could about motorsports & high-performance cars. This led me to the physics behind racing, mainly classical mechanics. During late 2017 & early 2018 I fell in love with physics. I took a physics class that completely changed my life.

I later went to community college in pursuit of an automotive degree. During community college I took a class in psychology which led to the start of my autobiography, starting with my time in that physics class. I had plans on returning to university in hopes of blending my love for physics & motorsports. A theory of everything.

March of 2021, I land a job at Mercedes-Benz of San Juan as a technician. I was 20 yrs old, working my way up the corporate ladder in pursuit for a better life for me & my family. In hopes of returning to university to peruse mechanical engineering for the race cars. In hopes of getting a PhD in physics and create a theory of everything, but everyone conspired against me in fear of losing their jobs.

Eventually I stumble upon the Modern Wisdom podcast, which led me to the conversations between Chris Williamson & Eric Weinstein. This led me to Jordan Peterson's lectures in Psychology & Maps of Meaning. I took a very strong interest in neuroscience, & religion. I then solved the meaning of life, a theory of everything. Some argued that I had found God. I disagreed. I had created a weapon of mass-destruction that can end the world. I created immortality.

I later tried to have these conversations with my co-workers, but was constantly being shut off, to drop the subject. They feared God, War, Artificial Intelligence, & alien invasions. Unbeknownst to them, it's literally just technology & physics they didn't understand. It was the same reaction with my parents. This led to the loss of my job since everywhere I went, I was spreading massive amounts of panic & fear, including my last training in Dallas, November 03 - November 07, 2024.

It feels like I'm stuck in a world where I'm the only sober person with no escape. I have no money, & no credibility. A college dropout. I later listened to a conversation you had with Eric Weinstein and mentioned Good Will Hunting. It made me recall a forgotten memory. A math teacher had recommended me to watch that movie. Early January, this year 2025 I watched that movie for the first time. It made me realize the importance of higher education & what true university professors are fighting for. Training & research, building a machine big enough to end all war.

This is what led me to reach out to you. Maybe We, are the aliens.",1,1739645339.0,u_5MeatTreat,0,1.0,False
1iq88c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1iq88c6/update_on_oh_god_shes_my_roommate/,"update on ""oh god she's my roommate""","also posting this here :) cw: mentions of magic mushrooms and brief mention of previous suicidality.

me and this girl have had a homoerotic friendship since we lived together a year and a half ago our senior year of college. we always were super flirty and basically acted liked a couple while we lived together. i ended up kissing her while we still lived together, a few months before we moved out. she told me it was one of the best kisses she's ever had. i knew i had feelings, and i wanted to try being in a relationship while we lived together. she told me no, and we went back to being friends. i studied abroad over the summer and kinda hoped my feelings would fizzle out without the close proximity, but the two months doing my own thing just made me realized how much i really wanted to be with her. we met up in new york with our mutual friend when i got back and she opened up and told me she's never been so close to someone, and that she wasn't sure if she wanted a relationship or friendship, and that she had realized internalized homophobia was probably the reason.

we went on a month long roadtrip after that (lol). not gonna lie it was harder than ever being so close to her 24/7 and not expressing physical affection. but it gave us a lot of time to talk. she asked me a lot about how I came out and had to overcome internalized homophobia. and by the third week she had bought new clothes that made her feel more confident in being gay and was talking about coming out to her mom when she got home. it made me so happy, because more than anything I just want to her to be free to be herself. after that, we did shrooms at her family's cabin, and not gonna lie it was really rough for me. i felt like i could see the trauma she went in the energy of the cabin, how she had to hide and mask who she really was. it was really heavy. like i was crying about the way the plants outside were being hurt and controlled and restricted and not free to grow wnd flourish in their natural form, and how the same thing happened to her here.

we pretty much had our own separate trips and then at the end we sat together on the dock and talked. she had listened to this song i showed her on repeat for the whole trip, and told me it helped her realize that she needed to give herself grace, because her confidence in her true self was powerful and deep and strong, and she just had to let it out. that made me really happy. things felt lighter, and we were dancing and then we were standing face to face while we swayed back and forth and i was trying to get in her head so she'd fall off the dock. she was standing on her tippy toes, and suddenly my whole body was giving me visions of me holding her waist and kissing her and then falling off the dock together, the dock where her many of her family bas been married üò≥. and then she smiled and said ""i'm having thoughts i shouldn't be having,"" looking at my lips. but i couldn't do it. i couldn't take the step forward. even though everything in myself was screaming to do it.

i think that in that moment i wanted to be the one on tippy toes, i wanted her to kiss me. i wanted her to be the one to take the leap. to show to herself and me that after all this time she could finally take a chance, and let her inner confidence out. after i realized i couldn't be the one to do it, i broke the tension and pushed her into the lake and jumped in. we laughed and laughed and laughed both knowing exactly what had just happened. feeling the power of it. the joy of it. knowing that the universe would give us another chance. the rest of the roadtrip went well, but that chance never came. there were moments, like there always were between us, but after feeling the intensity on that dock, i think i knew that if that chance were to happen, it would be deeply intense and romantic, and it would just happen. it wasn't meant to be when we were in a hot tub while we were talking about our kinks and getting shaky from the sexual tension, or in a random hotel teasing each other after admitting how much we were attracted to each other when we first met.

after the roadtrip, i moved back in with my parents. which was really rough going back to an environment that hadn't been safe for my true self growing up. we had talked of going abroad and doing seasonal work together, but i lost confidence in myself when i got home. and we kind of just drifted back into our own lives. it was really hard. i felt like i had lost my chance of being with her. like how could i have gone on a 6,000 mile roadtrip with her and not ended ended with her??? i beat myself up a lot. i replayed that moment on the dock over and over.

a few months later we saw each other again for my birthday. she drove 7 hours from a job site to see me. i was so nervous. honestly i was surprised she was coming. i kinda thought she had moved home and moved on. or maybe gone back into hiding herself. my friend from high school also came and brought shrooms and in the spur of the moment i took a small dose. she arrived a few hours later, to me and my friend completely at peace drinking tea and listening to music lmao. i immediately felt attracted to her, but it felt different. gentler, softer, less confusing and intense. just a mild but pure love and appreciation of her energy. she decided to take some shrooms too. the night went really well. my friend and her got along, and it was really special seeing her vibe with someone i had known a long time. he went to bed and texted me that i should make a move cause it was obvious how much she liked me.

at this point she was controlling the music, and she put on this song. i had always secretly felt like it was our song, cause it was the first song she showed me when i first got a crush on her that i deeply connected with and always reminded me of her. when i was studying abroad visiting my aunts it was playing at a rugby game and that was when I had a whole moment of realizing that I wanted to be with her, like really be with her how my gay aunts are together.

she came up to me and staring singing the song softly to me, motioning between our hearts. she had a mask on cause she was getting over a cold and my friend is a germaphobe lol. but her eyes told me everything i needed to know. i was melting. frozen. looking into her soul. knowing she truly felt the same. watching her be more confident in herself than ever. i wanted to gently loop my finger behind her ear, and slide her mask off, and see what would happen. but i didn't. again, i couldn't. instead i held my hand out in an effort to extend an offer for her to hold my hand and make a move... and this girl gives me a high five üòü. and makes the most evil laugh. and then she runs away and jumps on a chair and sings another song, this time like full on belting. about wanting to move in and share a life together. at this point i kinda start spiraling a little. like bruh. what the heck. i just stand there in shock while she sings to me on this chair. honestly i'm like overwhelmed with so many emotions, and i start feeling like I have to throw up. my heart has gone through so much. and i can see the depth of how she feels about me, but i just feel frustrated, and tired. the song ends. and she walks across the room and tells me ""you know i'm gonna break you one day."" and i'm just standing there in shock and manage to jokingly say ""i'm holding out strong."" and she laughs.

we go outside and lay on the ground and look at the stars. i'm so in my head at this point. there's a shooting star and we make wishes. obviously i wish that we'd finally get together. i figure when we wake up, the magic will have faded. once she's completely sober she will be repressing herself again. and we'll be in the same situation as we always are. we'll keep flirting like we always do, but it'll go back to feeling like our gay ass homoerotic friendship bromance. we wake up and it's my birthday. and she comes upstairs and she looks at me and the same feeling from the beginning of the night is still there. we are soft and light and warm towards each other all day. we give each other knowing looks. my friend keeps smiling at me, picking up on the energy between us. it's honestly one of the best birthdays i've ever had. i know deep down that things will work out between us, even if it takes some time. and there is no reason to rush.

that is until my parents call, and i lose all of my confidence again. i spiral. after that my friend had to leave and we go out out dinner, just me and her. and low and behold i start feeling like the sad friend-zoned girl again. we still have a ton of fun like we always do, but just like that, that soft warmth of confidence is gone. we end up sleeping on the couches, and wake up looking at each other. we end up having a really nice morning. we watch our favorite show (heartstopper) and i make breakfast. we're each heading home today but i try my best not to think about it.

things are warm and soft again, and when we are hugging goodbye, i gently ask if I can kiss her. i'm not asking with my whole self, like i did when we first kissed, or how it was on the dock. i'm asking with lightness, and softness, a gentle acknowledgment of the moments we shared over the weekend. i'm kind of expecting her to say no. but she says okay, but asks this will work (since we live so far away from each other). and i freeze up and just say i don't know. she laughs and says her lips are really chapped and goes to get chapstick from her car. she tells me ""okay we can do this but you are responsible for it."" that kinda twists my stomach cause i don't really know what it means, but I say that I will and we kiss. it's cute. it's gentle. it's nothing like the first time. the first time, we shook, i cried, i almost fainted. in all honesty, i don't feel all that much. it's nice, of course i like kissing her, but there isn't that intensity. it actually feels kinda a little unnatural and forced. but i kind of like it that way. it feels safe. not overwhelming. like we could kiss again and slowly explore, instead of jumping in like a huge dramatic leap of faith. we pull apart and we smile. we say bye and get in our cars and she rolls down her window. she jokes that i definetly got infected by her sickness now. i say ""well i clearly infected you with the gay disease, it's like shockingly obvious now"" and she opens her mouth in shock and laughs. she says she's gonna gap me and we drive into the sunset yapping on the phone about cars.

i feel pretty great about everything. i end up moving down to live with my sister which is even farther away, but i have faith that things will evolve that their own pace, and that the universe has our back...

a week later she's visiting her grandparents to do some construction for them, they live two hours from my sister, so we plan on meeting up. but then she says she can't cause she's so busy and exhausted and has to drive home the next day. i can't deal with the feeling of knowing she's within easy driving distance and not seeing her. i get really anxious and i convince myself that she's lying so she doesn't have to see me.

so i decide i have to be bold and make a big romantic gesture. i buy her flowers and drive to surprise her at her grandparents house. i call her when i get there but she's asleep at 8pm and i start to realize i should have respected what she was saying. she wakes up and is really confused and tired. i feel so embarrassed. i give her the flowers and she's happy... but then i ask her to be in a relationship with me. i can barely get the words out. this is not how i wanted this to happen at all. i wanted to take things slow. and now suddenly i'm way out of my comfort zone to prove myself to her or something. her face kinda falls, and says that she'll think about it.

i drive home and the next day i fully crash out. i'm so tired of all of the pressure im putting on myself to have this perfect movie like relationship and life. i text her a long paragraph saying i'm so tired of pretending to be this strong confident person when really i'm broken and just want to be taken care of. i turn my phone off cause i can't deal with the thought of seeing her type out a response. turns out i really scared her. i don't deal with any kind of suicidality anymore, but she knows that i used to when i was younger, and she got worried that's what was happening. she called my sister and leaves a voicemail on the verge of tears asking if i was okay. i run back to my phone and call her but she doesn't pick up. i text her profusely apologizing and promising that i'm okay.

she hearts my message and a few days she says we should meet up to talk and so she can give my back my plant that she was taking care of. my stomach sinks. i know this won't be good. she drives down again to work for her grandparents and we meet up halfway at a coffee shop. she is so cold. she's never been so cold to me. we sit down and she asks if i want to start or if she should. i tell her she can, and she tells me she doesn't think we should be friends anymore, that i keep misinterpreting her actions and it's too much to deal with. i can see how much i have hurt her.

something breaks inside of me, and i realize i have to be honest. i open up like i never have with her. i tell her about how i grew up equating my self worth to being a perfect child, perfect grades, perfect relationships, perfect life. how things had to happen on schedule, everything had to be meticulously planned for me to earn my parents love. she cried and i cried. i told her just how deeply i cared for her no matter what our relationship looked like on the outside. i told her that i loved her as a friend and just wanted to see her thrive and be her full self. she apologized for how bad she has been at keeping calling and communicating. and that she was going to try harder to find ways of keeping in touch that work for her. her dad treated her really badly growing up, and she has real difficulty with phone calls because of it. she told me how hard it is to keep in touch with everyone she loves, even her mom who she adores, and how she feels like a horrible daughter and friend because of it. by the end of the conversation, i felt so good that i had opened up, and so grateful that I wasn't losing her. she said that we should just be friends again. i was obviously sad cause i still wanted to be with her. but i felt okay to put that on pause and just work on our friendship.

it's been a few months since that conversation. we haven't been able to see each other, and have both been going through a lot. i miss her. the whole experience has driven me back into making music and i've written some songs about her which has helped me understand my feelings about her. i've come to realize that this love i have for her is allowed. it's a beautiful strong thing in me that is mine. i cherish it, i am proud to feel it. and ultimately it isn't her respnsibility. i was so ashamed of how i felt for so many reasons. i felt like i needed her to be a vessel of my love. i struggled to love myself, and i felt like i could't hold space for my love for another person when i had so much inner turmoil and self deprecation. it is a relief to just accept how deeply and completely i love her, and even more importantly how i love myself. i have mostly let go of this idea that we have to be in a relationship for the love i feel towards her to be real. and i have so much more self love to discover. i hope that one day i will be able to show her the music i wrote about her, without any expectation, as an act of honesty and love. i am so grateful for all of the memories we have shared, and i know deep down that it doesn't matter what happens, that when we are old looking back on our lives we will look back on these years with fondness and joy, grateful to have experienced a connection like ours.",0,1739645327.0,actuallesbians,0,0.5,False

me and this girl have had a homoerotic friendship since we lived together a year and a half ago our senior year of college. we always were super flirty and basically acted liked a couple while we lived together. i ended up kissing her while we still lived together, a few months before we moved out. she told me it was one of the best kisses she's ever had. i knew i had feelings, and i wanted to try being in a relationship while we lived together. she told me no, and we went back to being friends. i studied abroad over the summer and kinda hoped my feelings would fizzle out without the close proximity, but the two months doing my own thing just made me realized how much i really wanted to be with her. we met up in new york with our mutual friend when i got back and she opened up and told me she's never been so close to someone, and that she wasn't sure if she wanted a relationship or friendship, and that she had realized internalized homophobia was probably the reason.

we went on a month long roadtrip after that (lol). not gonna lie it was harder than ever being so close to her 24/7 and not expressing physical affection. but it gave us a lot of time to talk. she asked me a lot about how I came out and had to overcome internalized homophobia. and by the third week she had bought new clothes that made her feel more confident in being gay and was talking about coming out to her mom when she got home. it made me so happy, because more than anything I just want to her to be free to be herself. after that, we did shrooms at her family's cabin, and not gonna lie it was really rough for me. i felt like i could see the trauma she went in the energy of the cabin, how she had to hide and mask who she really was. it was really heavy. like i was crying about the way the plants outside were being hurt and controlled and restricted and not free to grow wnd flourish in their natural form, and how the same thing happened to her here. 

we pretty much had our own separate trips and then at the end we sat together on the dock and talked. she had listened to this song i showed her on repeat for the whole trip, and told me it helped her realize that she needed to give herself grace, because her confidence in her true self was powerful and deep and strong, and she just had to let it out. that made me really happy. things felt lighter, and we were dancing and then we were standing face to face while we swayed back and forth and i was trying to get in her head so she'd fall off the dock. she was standing on her tippy toes, and suddenly my whole body was giving me visions of me holding her waist and kissing her and then falling off the dock together, the dock where her many of her family bas been married üò≥. and then she smiled and said ""i'm having thoughts i shouldn't be having,"" looking at my lips. but i couldn't do it. i couldn't take the step forward. even though everything in myself was screaming to do it.

i think that in that moment i wanted to be the one on tippy toes, i wanted her to kiss me. i wanted her to be the one to take the leap. to
show to herself and me that after all this time she could finally take a chance, and let her inner confidence out. after i realized i couldn't be the one to do it, i broke the tension and pushed her into the lake and jumped in. we laughed and laughed and laughed both knowing exactly what had just happened. feeling the power of it. the joy of it. knowing that the universe would give us another chance. the rest of the roadtrip went well, but that chance never came. there were moments, like there always were between us, but after feeling the intensity on that dock, i think i knew that if that chance were to happen, it would be deeply intense and romantic, and it would just happen. it wasn't meant to be when we were in a hot tub while we were talking about our kinks and getting shaky from the sexual tension, or in a random hotel teasing each other after admitting how much we were attracted to each other when we first met. 

after the roadtrip, i moved back in with my parents. which was really rough going back to an environment that hadn't been safe for my true self growing up. we had talked of going abroad and doing seasonal work together, but i lost confidence in myself when i got home. and we kind of just drifted back into our own lives. it was really hard. i felt like i had lost my chance of being with her. like how could i have gone on a 6,000 mile roadtrip with her and not ended ended with her??? i beat myself up a lot. i replayed that moment on the dock over and over. 

a few months later we saw each other again for my birthday. she drove 7 hours from a job site to see me. i was so nervous. honestly i was surprised she was coming. i kinda thought she had moved home and moved on. or maybe gone back into hiding herself. my friend from high school also came and brought shrooms and in the spur of the moment i took a small dose. she arrived a few hours later, to me and my friend completely at peace drinking tea and listening to music lmao. i immediately felt attracted to her, but it felt different. gentler, softer, less confusing and intense. just a mild but pure love and appreciation of her energy. she decided to take some shrooms too. the night went really well. my friend and her got along, and it was really special seeing her vibe with someone i had known a long time. he went to bed and texted me that i should make a move cause it was obvious how much she liked me.

I'm one of those people, and so is songwriter Saara T√∂rm√§.","Saara T√∂rm√§ is 48, and she is a professional Finnish songwriter - she is the author behind several hits. This is her first song performed by herself, singing and dancing (that's the reason for autotune, Saara is not a professional singer with decades of training). She is also a former food journalist, which is suitable because her song is ""K√§√§retorttu"" - a jelly roll.



Apparently this has been a little hit on the Finnish side of Tiktok, but I heard this first time only recently in the Finnish ""top of the pops"", and it really struck a chord (pun not intended). Even if I am not living in the middle a falling social order, and dismantling of democracy, the waves are felt and the storm clouds seen over here, too. This song, like the act of baking and cooking, feels grounding. And like baking, also friendship is magic. Our lives are so short, and we share so little of our time together. (My best friend passed away suddenly and too early. When I visited him and his family, and other friends, I often baked pizza from scratch, for a shared dinner. Another friend usually baked a cake or some cookies for dessert. Everyone crammed in the kitchen, kids and cats running around... Those days and evenings and nights are something that keep me - keep all of us - going.) 



So here it is, with a rough translation of the lyrics. The world is currently a terrifying place, and most of us are trying to navigate among the ruins and chaos. But as long as we can call someone to have a cup of coffee or tea, we are not alone.




When the world goes off the rails, I start to bake

When all the news are giving anxiety, I'm kneading dough

I'll put cotton wool in my ears and bake buns

Hello to my friends, there is some cake here today

  


'Cause everything is currently terrifying

You're welcome to pop up at my place

  


What else can you do in all this chaos but bake?

What else can you do in this ruined world but make a little 

Jelly roll and invite you to have a cup of coffee 

What else can you do in this chaos but make a jelly roll 

(Jelly roll)

  


I'm getting all kinds of feelings that make me want to give up

So let's put some cinnamon rolls in the oven and make a mushroom pie 

  


'Cause everything is currently terrifying

You're welcome to pop up at my place

  


What else can you do in all this chaos but bake?

What else can you do in this ruined world but make a little

Jelly roll and invite you to have a cup of coffee

What else can you do in this chaos but make a jelly roll 

  


Welcome to pop up at my place

We'll have grandma's berry juice and fresh bread 

For a little while we live together and we'll bake together

  


What else can you do in this chaos but bake? 

What else is there to do in the ruins of this world but make a little

Jelly roll and invite you to have a cup of coffee 

 What else can you do in this chaos but make a jelly roll

1iq82j5,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1iq82j5/husband_ignored_valentines/,Husband ignored Valentines,"I am 32(F) married to 35(M) for 5 years now. We have 1 daughter and just recently lost a son born premie. 
I consider myself big on appreciation and therefore would never ignore anything meant to appreciate my partner. This Valentine, he insinuated that he didn‚Äôt want to go out, and I was okay with it. Previously, we have always done something to mark Valentines, mostly dinners. 
Now, because we were not going out, I went out and got him a small gift. He has been in need of travel mugs for his morning coffee, so I got two nice travel mugs and had them engraved his name. Quite a non expensive gift, but thoughtful in my opinion. (Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong). 
On 13 Feb, at night, in bed, he brought it up by himself and said he did have a gift for me and would give me in the morning . Fast forward, Valentine‚Äôs Day at 12noon when I ask for my gift(hate that I had to), and he brushed me off, several times. 
At this point, I am getting irritated. I wait for him to get home and he comes home with a piece of cake from a coffee shop. I buy sometime and realize he has no intention of doing anything this Valentine‚Äôs. 
So I get very pissed: 
1. He created an expectation that he had no intention of honoring. (As a bad joke, he said he wanted to have sex üòê)
2. We are still recovering from loss, I would think this would be a good time to appreciate each other. 
3. I really wasn‚Äôt asking for the world, just a gesture. Tbh, even a text would have somewhat cut it. 

He felt justified and said he does so many things and doesn‚Äôt need to do anything for one day. It means nothing. But later when social media let us know how much effort our friends had put for Valentines, I have a feeling he will now try to do something.

Now, he makes more money than I do and I WFH 90% of the time. I don‚Äôt think I have let myself go, but I don‚Äôt dress up every day as I used to. I do feel he‚Äôs gotten very comfortable and doesn‚Äôt feel the need to put in work for me. Bare minimum. I take care of him fully, make his breakfast, serve his dinners, he is very well taken care of. His birthday is coming up on Feb 16, as usual I have made a reservation and gotten gifts. But I am feeling very resentful. I can‚Äôt return the gifts but want to cancel the dinner. I am also feeling like I should detach from him, get out(not cheat) and basically live, without him. 


Was I crazy for getting angry? 
Men, is recognition on Valentines too much to ask for? Am I being immature? 

Tl;DR 
Husband ignored valentines for the first time. I got him a gift, I didn‚Äôt even get a text. He feels justified that one day means nothing. I got very pissed, his birthday is coming up, what do I do?",5,1739644890.0,marriageadvice,3,0.86,False

(Different countries) In the past month or two it's been super flirty and we've been honest that we both really like each other. At first I tried to tell myself that anything we had was just for fun and not possible, given the distance between us. 

After it was clear we're both really falling for eachother, I started to reconsider. Maybe...it's possible? I brought it up to her, the idea of maybe doing long distance some day in the future. She liked the idea but said she wanted to take things slow, which I am fine with, and actually agree with. I made it clear I would want to take her out on a couple of online ""dates"" (I.e. video calling over coffee, streaming a movie together, etc.) first before we actually starting anything official, obviously. 

But then she told me she wanted to get to know me better first, before going on any dates. Which kind of confuses me, because I feel like that's the whole point of a date- to get to know someone better and find out if you want to move into anything deeper with them. 

I'm at a loss for what to do... I will respect her wishes to take things slower. I'm just not sure what to do from this point moving forward. I'm not sure at what point I'm supposed to ask her out again without sounding desperate or like I'm trying to rush things? Thank you all üôè",5,1739644804.0,LongDistance,3,0.86,False

At out first stop (23km) we had a coffee and decided that we were too wet to complete the whole course. The start of the day was the wettest while we were out. By the time we stopped our gloves were wet, my socks we wet and we were a little miserable. We decided to head in a different direction for lunch and then finish the last 25km of the original route. We ended up with 57km in almost solid light-medium rain. The temperature was between 3-5¬∞C. We stopped for a nice lunch and it totally turned around out day, it ended enjoyable and fun. 

A few lessons:
I took some advice from some of the comments to my previous post. I put my feet inside plastic bags before putting them in my shoes. This did not work. The bags just filled with water run off from my legs and was fairly awful. 

We did take spare socks, gloves and jerseys. My jersey was nice and dry, but I changed gloves and socks.

My husband tells me he doesn't feel wanted. He's not explicitly saying what he's lacking, but I know it's sex and/or sexual touch. We hug, kiss, talk and sometimes watch movies or tv in the evenings so we have some non-sexual intimacy. After kids are in bed, he plays games and I do some housework and watch reality TV. 

He tends to make everything sexual. If he gets coffee or brings home a treat, he'll say ""does this get me points for tonight?"" or ""this loosen up your mouth for later?"" So I know he's expecting something in return. If I bring this up that I'm put off by these comments then he says I wouldn't give him intimacy without his reminders. And claims he's showing love in MY love language by getting these little gifts. So I should be fulfilled. 

He has also said that masturbation is frustrating for him because he has a wife that could be doing it instead. 

My periods after kids have been far longer than in the past, and I personally am not comfortable with period sex. Plus I've been having some issues with intermittent nausea and reflux that I'm on medication for, but it makes it hard many nights to put anything in my mouth, including counting his dick. So when we have dry spells of about a week and a half, he brings this up in a fight. He's sexually frustrated. He's not getting love.

I broke and told him he has no rights to my body. I don't have to justify why I'm not in the mood any given night. If he wants to have intimacy and watch a movie or cuddle, I'm absolutely open to that but I am tired of my body being the reason he can control his mood. On good weeks he will be in a great mood and will say ""see isn't it nice when you put out and I'm happy. "" Because it's true, if he hasn't gotten any then he's not happy. He's short with the kids. My 4 year old regularly asks me why daddy is mad at her. He doesn't comfort her, he yells or talks down to her daily. Except when he's gotten sex. 

He won't go to therapy, thinks it's biased towards women. I don't know how to get it across to him that he is responsible for his own feelings. My body doing sexual favors should not be what makes him be a good person. We used to have similar sex drive but kids came into the picture and I'm frankly exhausted.

I'm breadwinner, work full time, do all pickups and take off when kids are sick or snow days. He does do housework like dishes and cooking and school drop off. We don't talk much because I'm worried about current politics but we're on opposite sides and sometimes he will start name-calling if I express concern about things. He gets out at least once a week to see his friends plus games every night. I rarely get out so I don't understand how he can feel burnt out. I don't feel sexy when all I'm wanted for is sex. Sorry for the novel but thanks for reading if you did. 

Edit for info: we have sex 2-3x per week and he gets oral another 2-3x per week so many weeks there's only 1-2 days he has no sexual interaction.

It's a post I've been meaning to make for a while, but I've struggled to find the courage and the words. I'm just really desperate for some guidance, understanding, and kindness. I feel so lost. TL;DR at the bottom in bold. 

For a little background, I've had 3 confirmed COVID infections. The first was in Dec. 2020, before the vaccine. It was a very mild acute infection. The only certain long-term effect I experienced was temporary exercise-induced asthma, but it went away after a few months. I started getting migraines maybe 6 or so months after that infection, too. But part of it may be that I finally learned more about what migraines actually are, so it's likely I was experiencing them way before my infection, I just didn't know, and they weren't very severe. 

My second infection was in Feb. 2023. By that point, I'd had all my primary vaccines and boosters every 6 months. Again the acute infection was very mild. Looking back and reading through old journal entries from that time, I didn't notice any changes or long-term symptoms. The first and second infections I got from my sister, whom I lived with at the time. She was really shitty about testing/being generally aware of when she was sick and trying to keep me safe. 

Some time in 2023 my partner and I, and everyone I knew, stopped taking precautions. I guess we all believed the lie that COVID was fine now as long as we got our vaccines regularly. I still wore a mask at the doctor's and when flying, but I was very lax otherwise. My third infection happened this past October 2024. I now live with my partner, and he co-owns a coffee shop, while I work from home. He wasn't masking at the time and caught COVID. By the time we realized it, he'd already passed it to me. We both, again, had mild acute infections. It was his second infection and my third. While sick, I went on a bit of a deep dive here on Reddit and learned all about the actual dangers of COVID. It terrified me. As soon as I started to text negative, I noticed my hear rate would feel like it was spiking out of nowhere. I started to randomly feel all the physical symptoms of anxiety without any obvious cause. Soon the mental side of anxiety crept in, too. I felt an overwhelming sense of terror and doom. I was convinced I was going to die, and that the world was going to end. My partner and I started masking again and bought an air purifier. I got a Fitbit to track my heart rate and saw that even a slow walk made my heart rate skyrocket to 185bmp (this has since resovled and I now have a healthy heart rate). Around this time, I would spend HOURS every single day reading studies on COVID or researching masks and things like that. It became an obsession and a compulsion. Finally, in December, I made an appointment with my doctor and was prescribed SSRIs (Sertraline). I was also given a requisition to get my blood taken to check general levels. My partner and I cancelled holiday plans, and I began my medication. 

Since then, the meds have helped IMMENSELY. So I'm very very grateful for that. I have only very minor side effects. Sadly, my migraines became more frequent after that 3rd infection, but I think part of it may be because I've lowered my salt intake (the infection weirdly made me way more sensitive to salt, and made coffee taste more bitter). This lower salt intake likely makes me more dehydrated and seems to be lowering my blood pressure, which has always been very low to begin with. So I've been making an effort to eat more salt, and drink electrolytes. I've been taking CoQ-10 this past week, too. So far, I've gone 6 days migraine-free, which is a record for me now. 

During my follow-up appointment to discuss my SSRI journey, my doctor told me that my bloodwork showed that my iron was low (17) and my neutrophils were low (1.9). I looked at the report, and my WBC was also on the lower end (4.3, when the healthy range is 4-11). She asked if I'd been sick recently, and I told her the last time was in October (over 3 months ago) and she said that they should be back up to normal by now. She assumes I've been sick since then but I've been masking DILIGENTLY. I don't see anyone unmasked. I haven't had any symptoms, either. So I'm very worried that these low white blood cell numbers are due to COVID. It's like my worst fear has come true. She told me to take a higher dose of iron and take it diligently, and to check these levels again in 3 months. 

Now. What has been weighing me down and eating me alive is... how do I live? I know that, ideally, I basically become a hermit. Never leave the house unmasked, never have people over unless I can test them with an NAAT test, etc. etc. But the thought of having to calculate every little choice in life makes me want to give up living. The thought of having to spend over $500 CAD to get a LifePlus machine + $100 for every TEN tests isn't feasible. And honestly I feel so awkward even thinking about asking people to test every time I want to see them unmasked. I live somewhere with long, brutal winters, so the window to see friends outside is very short. 

But beyond that, there's my partner. He often works alone for hours and has to take his mask off to eat, drink water, and dial the espresso machine. He also just is more careless than I am and doesn't always adjust his mask 100% correctly 100% of the time, so sometimes the seal isn't perfect. He's trying really hard! I know he is! But he's just a bit absent-minded about it sometimes. And I'm so tired of correcting him and criticizing him when I know he really does try his best. He's experiencing his own awful mental health issues that are unrelated and I know he can only take on so much right now. And there's the issue of his family, too. His mom is a nurse, and her relationship with health has always been that illness and death are just a part of life. She takes zero precautions, and neither does his father. So far, they've only had one COVID infection that they know of, and haven't had any obvious long-term effects, so they don't understand why I'm suddenly so intent on prevention again. They ask to see us all the time, and since we live 2 hours apart, always want to meet at a restaurant part-way between us. We have diligently said no, but we made an exception for my partner's birthday last month. I didn't go, but they went to a quiet restaurant early in the morning when there were no other customers. Luckily we seem to have dodged an infection. But I worry about continuously saying no to them because we're somewhat financially dependent on them. My partner's father loaned him money for his business, and if either of us were ever to have to stop working, they would be the ones to support us financially, so I don't want to have to cut them off or avoid them forever, you know? But they're not receptive or understanding of us only wanting to see them masked. And now with me possibly having immunity issues I'm just sad and scared and don't know what to do with my life. 

There's a part of me that thinks maybe my ""best"" is continuing to mask in public and avoid indoor dining, but allowing for very small get-togethers once cold & flu season dies down a bit. I know some people here will say that I absolutely need to prioritize my safety and that I shouldn't ever share air with others, or that I shouldn't be with someone who doesn't take 100% perfect precautions, but that's just not realistic. My partner and I love each other dearly, and he has been so good to me. He cares for me when I have migraines and has stated time and time again that he's going to be here with me no matter what kind of illness or tragedy befalls us. I know that seeing people can be a risk, but I also feel like this endless caution and obsession with never putting myself at risk is completely destroying my mental health. The hypervigilance is so exhausting. I'm just really struggling to see a path forward. I'm trying to learn radical acceptance, and I've been leaning on the teachings of secular Buddhism, which have been helpful, but I just wish there was someone who could hold me and tell me how I should live my life. I feel like I'm flying blind and like I don't know the right way to live anymore. I don't know ANYONE taking even the slightest precautions (other than my step-dad who wears a baggy blue mask on the bus). I have never felt so alone or unsure of how to proceed in my life. I had been frequenting r/ZeroCovidCommunity, but it was awful for my mental health because I kept finding new reasons to feel afraid and always felt like I was not doing enough. This sub has been a beautiful life-line, so I really do appreciate all of you and would be grateful for any advice or encouragement. 

**TL;DR: I've had three confirmed COVID infections, with the first in December 2020, the second in February 2023, and the third in October 2024. The first two infections were mild with minimal long-term effects, but the third led to severe anxiety and physical symptoms like a high heart rate (which has since resolved) and more frequent/severe migraines. I became obsessed with COVID research and precautions, which affected my mental health. I started taking SSRIs, which have helped, but I still have more frequent migraines and low levels of iron and white blood cells (low neutrophils and borderline low WBC count). I'm struggling with how to live safely without becoming a hermit and basically cutting everyone out of my life, especially since my partner isn't quite as diligent as I am (he's really trying but it doesn't come as naturally to him/his work situation makes it hard to never unmask). His family also concerns me. We don't live with them, but they support us financially and regularly want to see us, but they don't take any precautions. I'm trying to balance safety with mental health and I'm just seeking some guidance on how to move forward. I just feel more lonely and lost than I ever have before. I don't know how to live anymore.**

Mashbill: 51% corn, 45% wheat, 4% malted barley 
 
Age: 10+ years 

The mashbill matches MGP‚Äôs wheated bourbon mashbill.  MGP started distilling its 51/45/4 mashbill in 2013‚Ä¶ and would‚Äôve first had 10 year available in 2023. World Whiskey Society also first started releasing the 10 year Oklahoma-distilled 51/45/4 in 2023.

Proof: 96

MSRP for the Special Edition Collector‚Äôs Case: $249

Nose üëÉ: Brown sugar. Red apple skin. Light coffee beans. Vanilla cupcake. Chili powder. 

Palate üëÖ: Nutmeg. Molasses cookies. Chocolate syrup. Funnel cake topped with apple pie filling.

Finish üèÅ: Yellow cake. Dark chocolate. Mint. Loads of honey.

The mouthfeel initially feels rather thin and concerning, but then out of nowhere, it starts picking up body. The strong honey note that comes at the end leaves the mouth feeling coated with honey. 

The fancy collectors box doesn‚Äôt mean much to me. I‚Äôm evaluating this based on the actual bourbon. It‚Äôs unique, but the 96 proof falls a bit flat for me on the initial palate. However, the finish is spectacular.

I don‚Äôt have the space to display fancy set-ups such as this. If you enjoy ornate packaging such as this, this might be a bit more enticing. For me, if I‚Äôm going to drop $249 on a bourbon, this collector‚Äôs edition isn‚Äôt it.

Do I enjoy the bourbon? Yes. If I could buy the bourbon by itself without the fancy packaging, I would be happy at $70-80.

Bottle was provided by World Whiskey Society for review 

Rating based on actual bourbon: 5

Based on the price that it would require to purchase this set‚Ä¶ based on what‚Äôs in my glass alone‚Ä¶ not something that I would recommend you spending $249 to acquire

So when I was walking down the street yesterday, a  ""friend"" with misopphonia whom I was supposed to be meeting for coffee (and who also very well knows I am dyspraxic and have walking issues) yelled at me, screaming that my lazy walking was hugely triggering her misophonia and that I was also doing this on purpose and deliberately.  I decided to fight back (since I am majorly sick and bloody tired of even people who are friends and family always or at least way too often taking me to task for having motor issues, for blaming me for my dyspraxia, for telling me that being clumsy is somehow my fault etc.) and told her that she knows I have dyspraxia and that her claiming that my walking was being deliberately triggering was nasty and unacceptable and not what a true friend would say (and yes, I did  actually also apologise for being triggering but that I was just not willing to take blame for having walking issues and that I was somehow walking clumsily to deliberately bother my ""friend"").

And no, I do not feel at all guilty saying what I said either and if she does not reach out and apologise, well, that is on her and has nothing at all to do with me (and that I am not going to risk slipping etc. while walking because the sound of this might be a trigger, for my safety while walking comes first, and just to say that I also often trigger myself while walking but that is simply how my dyspraxia manifests itself and needs to be accepted not only by me, but by everyone).",3,1739644244.0,misophonia,6,0.8,False

I am a lifelong member of the church and have always followed the Word of Wisdom to the best of my ability. When I was in Ireland, I was with a tour group, and they had lots of coffee, tea, and alcohol, which I obviously abstained from. On the first day there, the tour group went to a pub and we all had a delicious brunch, which served us blood pudding and black pudding. I tried both and genuinely liked them. For the remainder of the week-long trip, I occasionally got some from the hotel  breakfast buffets. Fast forward to when I got home. I made a really nice photo album of the trip with pictures of meals that I ate. My husband asked me what it was and I told him ""blood pudding"". He then told me that his dad, who served a mission in England, was told to not eat it because it was against the word of wisdom. This confuses me, because I don't remember any specific counsel about eating foods like this.

So, for members that live in areas where blood pudding is common, do you consume it? Do you consider it against the word of wisdom?

1iq7s84,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iq7s84/are_espresso_forward_cafes_economically_feasible/,Are espresso forward cafes economically feasible?,"   I‚Äôd like to preface this by stating that I respect and admire all the coffee workers I‚Äôve encountered in my life. I understand you‚Äôre doing the best you can within a structure/system that was mainly created by someone else. My concerns aren‚Äôt aimed at the person pulling shots and steaming milk. I‚Äôm thinking of the folks coming up with the business plans and broad coffee goals for these cafes. 

   I wish there were a truly espresso-forward caf√© in my area. I want to taste shots that use a variety of roast, flow, and temperature profiles. Maybe I‚Äôm just talking about whatever the concept of ‚Äúthird wave coffee‚Äù is without realizing it. I feel discouraged when I ask about a specific type of coffee or shot style and hear, ‚ÄúYeah, those are great, but I‚Äôd have to dial in my grinder, so‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúFine, just give me a cortado with your go-to espresso blend.‚Äù Sigh. 

   I want to visit a caf√© that uses a single dose grinder that is quick to adjust between multiple different grind settings without needing to worry about the grinder‚Äôs calibration fluctuating. A caf√© where the patrons don‚Äôt mind waiting a bit longer to receive their drink, because to them, drink quality and variety are more important than speed and quantity. 

   I‚Äôm imagining a caf√© that has a handful of different beans matched up with a handful of different shot styles/recipes. The staff maintains a detailed log of various shot parameters. At the beginning of each shift, they dial in each recipe and annotate their findings on an app and ledger, in case the app isn‚Äôt functioning. The espresso machine can adjust flow rate and maybe even temperature in real time. I‚Äôm thinking of basically the Decent, but with manual controls. Like a Slayer, but you could also adjust the water temperature during the shot. Perhaps using a Decent with a key number of solid automated recipes on the main screen, so it‚Äôs easier for employees to pull tasty shots without dealing with too steep of a training curve. 

   Has anyone experienced a place like this, or perhaps worked there? Is this feasible? I don't want to be overly braggadocios, but it's gotten where the tastiest espresso I can experience is in my own kitchen. I guess that's inevitable as anyone gets better at dialing stuff in to their own preferences. I just want to be wowed again without needing to travel to a huge metropolis. First world problems, I know.

I joined a job about 7 days ago. Today, HR reached out to me to tell me that two of her fellow colleagues (two HR ladies) who I met earlier this week had told her that I seem uninterested and seem to have an attitude. 

I‚Äôm shocked. I‚Äôm quite a shy person by nature and suffer from social anxiety, but I‚Äôm quite good at what I do and I love meeting people and making friends. I can be awkward, but really my interaction with these two ladies was perfectly sweet. We were even joking around. I thought they were very sweet. One of them walked me through the HR systems. I‚Äôd already been through them, so I didn‚Äôt have any questions, but I did make sure to show my interest by nodding along and laughing at her jokes. We had coffee together. I really liked her. This meeting was one day into my new job. The other lady I only met in person once, but she‚Äôd set all my onboarding meetings, so I knew her by only her name.  I went up to her and introduced myself and apologized for constantly asking her to reschedule the onboarding meetings she‚Äôs set for me (I always make sure to be very thankful). 

The day before yesterday, I saw the First Lady and said hi to her, and she said hi back and then looked away. I got weird vibes because I was going to ask her how she‚Äôs doing and continue the conversation, but it seemed like she doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me. But I ignored it because I thought maybe it‚Äôs just me overthinking social settings again. 

Today, my HR recruiter came to me and told me she got this feedback from those two ladies and she was surprised to hear this, so she wanted to check if someone is bothering me. 

I‚Äôm very shocked and hurt. I thought the interactions were perfectly lovely, and it‚Äôs deeply hurt my feelings to know they were talking about me like this on my very first week (I‚Äôm on probation). Am I wrong to think it‚Äôs too soon for them to be making judgments and gossiping about it? At the very least, they should‚Äôve tried to talk to me about it. It‚Äôs been 7 days. I‚Äôm still getting used to the job. I‚Äôm overwhelmed and stressed. Is it wrong to expect empathy? I‚Äôm also very hurt because I always overthink social interactions, and it takes a lot for me to put myself out there. It hurts to know that this is the outcome when I do. With my other team members, things have been going great, but now I‚Äôm overthinking every interaction. I‚Äôm deeply hurt. Is this not unprofessional of them? Sorry to repeat this but I‚Äôm extremely extremely hurt and almost feel unmotivated.

I'd like to apologise in advance for this long post; i want to explain my situation as good as i can so i hopefully get the advice i need. So grab some coffee :) 

  
First off, we've known each other for around 1 year and 2 months. We met on an app, we 'matched' and immediatly clicked. She looked (still does) like an angel and i fell for her like a brick. We texted more and more, i always told her how lovely she looks and to my surprise she thought the same about me. We kept texting and created a real connection, telling each other about our days with the compliments about each other slipping in most our texts, as well as some pictures. We have been talking pretty much every day since then, i can count the days we didn't on 1 hand. Sometimes hours at a time.

We live about 1200km's apart. This is only maybe a 2-3 hours flight, and i wouldn't hesitate a moment to go see her if i could however; as we were both still in school meeting up never really was a possibility. Added to that is that she lives in another country were the school vacations mostly happen at different times then mine do/did. Because of this we never really talked about meeting up- at least not yet. We both still live with our parents so we are also not independant yet. But we both enjoyed talking to each other enough to continue doing it. We would usually send a good morning text, have school and whatnot and then towards the evening is when we would be/and still are most active. During this time i lived in my dorm going to college, so it would have been easy to feel lonely and miss her and although i did miss her, i kind of accepted we wouldnt be meeting up anytime soon and i never really felt down or bad about this. On the contrary, i was happy i had someone i connected with this much and could talk to about anything anytime i wanted. She felt pretty much the same to me.

Fast forward a few months of continuing this and i graduated college. She's still in school. Once i graduated i decided not to search a job with my diplome i graduated with right away: i decided to work temporarily in my uncle's business while figuring out what to do in life. So pretty much nothing changed, meaning she is still in school during the day and more free in the evening and i am working during the day and more free towards the evening too. We continued this for a few months up untill the start of this year, having long and good talks pretty much every day. We started to call each other nice names, babe, bb, pookie, sweetheart, love, ... . We tell each other often we love each other. We miss each other. We think of each other. We still missed each other but were happy with each other in our lives for now.

I decided to pursue something i always thought of doing in my life: i decided to enlist in the army. Ive been talking of the army since i was a kid, and i think- as well as all my friends and family- that it really suits me. I know some of you are thinking 'why the army if you miss her' well here's the thing.

Ive never ever in my life had a problem being alone for some time or even a few days, weeks, ... . I enjoyed being at my dorm on my own. Ive never had bad/depressing feelings about being alone. So when doing the army procedures i never thought about this being a problem since it never was. 

During this time, end of fall 2024, a collegue at my job, who happens to be from the same country she is asked if i wanted to come with him on a trip to his home country, which he always does during that time of the year since my uncle's business closes each year for about a month. He asked me this the year before as well, however i wasnt interested at all. By now i was still hesitant at first, however the more i thought of it and talked to her about it the more i wanted to go to go visit her. We started planning what to do, ... and my buddy had no problem dropping me off in her city, he was supportive of it. Important to know is that i haven't told my parents any of this since i'm sure they wouldn't approve me going to a foreign country for a girl i 'dont really know'. I wanted to keep it quiet untill having actually met her. She also knows this. My buddy also knows this. Plan was to rent a hotel room in a big city near her for a few days. 

However, the closer the closing time of my uncle's business came, the more my buddy (collegue) told me there was a chance of him not going. This chance grew by the day, and eventually when the closing time was there he decided not to go. We were both really sad about this, and i couldn't take the plane myself since i wanted to keep it quiet for now. We snuck it up and continued on like we always did, and things kept going great with her.

I decided to quit my job at my uncle's a few weeks ago now. I thought it would be a good thing for me to take some time for myself before joining the army. The procedure of joining takes multiple months. I figured i would try to visit her during this period, before i joined up. I came up with a plan to have a buddy of mine come with me, however things were quite difficult since basically all my friends are still in school also, but this new buddy gave the green light to go. She told me she has a really busy schedule, not only in school but she's also looking to go on an erasmus program which takes a lot of her time after school also. She also has to do a lot of chores in the house. But she had 2 weeks vacation in February, so we figured we would plan to meet in this vacation period. Only thing left to do was wait untill i got news from the army about my first day in basic camp. Once i got it, our hopes were once again shattered as my first week happens in the same time as her first week of vacation. We got quite devastated by this, me especially. 

It made me really doubt if i wanted to do this. I still doubt. Since we had the possibility to meet in November we've been trying to since then, and this was a time where we both knew we could 100% meet up, no school, no nothing. So now we again have to wait. I've asked the army if they have off days/periods as well and they do, they roughly follow the school vacation periods, except maybe not so long as school. I also came to know in summer i have a month off, so this would be perfect to meet. Sad part is: this is 5 months from now.

  
During these weeks off, which i thought would be good for me, ive had one hell of a ride mentally. I started getting bored quite fast, and i kept overthinking everything. This combined with some stress for the army was really bad. I didn't have any occupation during the day anymore but she of course did. It made me get really attached to her. All my friends were having exams around that time, so did she. My friends were all having their exams so meeting up with them was not possible. This caused me to get really get in a bit of a depressive state. I still talked with her towards the evening, just a little less since she's very busy especially this time of the year with exams. I tried to stay occupied but found it really hard, i never stopped thinking about her. I talked about this with her and she told me it's good i told her, and she would keep it in mind. During this time we actually started having our first actual calls, which i know is weird after a year but we only ever sent voice messages to each other, not actual calls. 

  
So i started missing her a lot. I tried my best not to force her too much, not to be annoying, give her the space she needs and i also told her this, she said i could never annoy her, ... . Like i said, i never had a problem being alone but during this time i really had a hard time. During the day it would happen that i was on delivered for quite a few hours, this caused my overthinking to go through the roof. This of course caused a negative spiral but she always got back to me in the end. We still talk pretty much every evening/night. We still say we like each other a lot, love each other, miss each other, send dumb reels about our feelings to each other. 

To switch things up i asked her if she wanted to videocall, which she wanted, so we scheduled a day. However i didnt hear from her that day. Nor my message asking her if all is good. It wasn't untill the next day in the evening she told me she had the flu and was bed ridden, in between sleeping and being sick. I was happy she did respond, of course my overthinking really got me here and i started thinking she had enough of me. She ensured me she didn't and we are still very much good. We had a call a few days later, this was really good. 

  
Finally, im in the present. I still very much miss her during the day but hear from her towards the evening, which makes my day. We still talk like we did all the months ago. However i am getting worried that during my time in the army we will not be in contact so much. I should still have a decent amount of free time in the evening, should have my phone on me during the day, but i am worried we will drift apart and not make it untill summer when we can meet up. It's hard to plan a meetup before this time, since i have to 'keep it quiet'. Maybe if she flies to my but in her school schedule it's quite hard. 

In conclusion i am getting really worried we will lose contact and drift apart. I am overthinking like crazy when i'm not talking with her. It is really weird though and i don't get it, i can wake up to a sweet text of her something like 'good morning darling x' and still feel bad throughout the day when she is in school and not able to text me. These last few weeks ive been living in a state of fear, fearing she isnt going to respond, isnt going to answer, ... . 

A few days ago we thought of a nice way spend time together and would plan minecraft 'dates'. We planned one on valentine's day. That day she got a weird call from her grandmother, and her grandmother is already in bad health and she fears it might be her last time on earth, so she went by to check on her and stayed with her for a bit not being able to have her mc date with me. She asked to postpone, which is no problem, but i always fear she's not going to hold up our dates since that time she left me alone when we planned our first call (in which she only responded the next day in the evening). It feels like im not on her priority list anymore, but a lot of actions go into this, but i still have this fear. Im pretty sure i'm just overthinking way too much but i honestly cannot stop thinking of her and my mood depends on being able to talk to her or not. This is why i look forward to joining the army, so i'm always occupied, but i also fear i will still miss her during.

  
(about the mc date, i asked for the following evening (which is today) and she told me she would update since she's going to a city with a friend of her on a daytrip, but also told me she should be back in the evening. This ofc makes me think i can have the date with her this evening but i haven't heard from her since and i'm starting to fear she might not update me (like she didnt do our first call neither).

Today, HR reached out to me to tell me that two of her fellow colleagues (two HR ladies) who I met earlier this week had told her that I seem uninterested and seem to have an attitude. 

I‚Äôm shocked. I‚Äôm quite a shy person by nature and suffer from social anxiety, but I‚Äôm quite good at what I do and I love meeting people and making friends. I can be awkward, but really my interaction with these two ladies was perfectly sweet. We were even joking around. I thought they were very sweet. One of them walked me through the HR systems. I‚Äôd already been through them, so I didn‚Äôt have any questions, but I did make sure to show my interest by nodding along and laughing at her jokes. We had coffee together. I really liked her. This meeting was one day into my new job. The other lady I only met in person once, but she‚Äôd set all my onboarding meetings, so I knew her by only her name.  I went up to her and introduced myself and apologized for constantly asking her to reschedule the onboarding meetings she‚Äôs set for me (I always make sure to be very thankful). 

The day before yesterday, I saw the First Lady and said hi to her, and she said hi back and then looked away. I got weird vibes because I was going to ask her how she‚Äôs doing and continue the conversation, but it seemed like she doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me. But I ignored it because I thought maybe it‚Äôs just me overthinking social settings again. 

Today, my HR recruiter came to me and told me she got this feedback from those two ladies and she was surprised to hear this, so she wanted to check if someone is bothering me. 

I‚Äôm very shocked and hurt. I thought the interactions were perfectly lovely, and it‚Äôs deeply hurt my feelings to know they were talking about me like this on my very first week (I‚Äôm on probation). Am I wrong to think it‚Äôs too soon for them to be making judgments and gossiping about it? At the very least, they should‚Äôve tried to talk to me about it. It‚Äôs been 7 days. I‚Äôm still getting used to the job. I‚Äôm overwhelmed and stressed. Is it wrong to expect empathy? I‚Äôm also very hurt because I always overthink social interactions, and it takes a lot for me to put myself out there. It hurts to know that this is the outcome when I do. With my other team members, things have been going great, but now I‚Äôm overthinking every interaction. I‚Äôm deeply hurt. Is this not unprofessional of them? Sorry to repeat this but I‚Äôm extremely extremely hurt and almost feel unmotivated. 

How do I deal with this situation? ",2,1739643841.0,jobs,6,1.0,False

Have you ever peered into your cavernous closet and thought, ""Ugh, everything here is so last season, and by 'season,' I mean the season finale of Friends""? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Fear not, my fashionistas, because there's a tsunami of talent swelling on the horizon: emerging fashion designers who are stitching their names into the fabric of the future! These bright stars are bringing us the wardrobe refresh we've been daydreaming about while mindlessly scrolling through our ex's cousin's vacation pics. üèùÔ∏èüëÄ

* **Eco-what? Oh, Eco-chic!**
  Sustainability isn't just for your smoothie-straw-hoarding aunt anymore. Emerging designers are crafting couture that'll have you ""oohing"" and ""aahing"" without leaving Mother Earth crying. They're swapping the old 'use-and-abuse' methods for 'renew-and-reuse' marvels, so you can strut that runway-of-life guilt-free!

* **Technically... it's fashion!**
  Some of these wizardly weavers are merging threads with tech like you've never seen. Imagine a jacket that tells you the weather or a shirt that changes color based on your mood ‚Äì ""Oh, it's glaringly red? Yes, I AM mad that you spilled coffee on me, Kevin."" It's not just fashion; it's ... ‚ú® science fashion ‚ú®.

* **Cultural Couture**
  We're sending cultural ambassadors down the catwalk, draped in heritage with a twist of modern. These designs make you want to deep dive into a history book with a pair of 3D glasses ‚Äì it's cultural appreciation with a side of flair, delivering a message of diversity one stitch at a time.

* **Affordable? Adorable!**
  And guess what? Some of these design darlings are shunning the traditional 'if you have to ask, you can't afford it' approach. Their creations don't scream ""I need a second mortgage,"" but more of a cheerful ""Yeah, I'm chic AND my bank account is still breathing!"" We like that, don't we?

So you ask, ""What does this mean for me and my 'I genuinely liked capes' stance?"" It means you, my fabulous friend, are on the precipice of a wardrobe wonderland. Breaking news: being en vogue doesn't have to mean cloning closet trends set by celebs who believe ""incognito"" means wearing sunglasses indoors.

Let's raise our lattes, irrationally expensive scented candles, and, dare I say, capes - to these trailblazing tailors. They're spinning, sewing, and saving our style, one unconventional hemline at a time. Trust me, they're the kind of change we want jangling in the pockets of our oh-so-sustainable trousers. üòâ

Join the conversation, drop your thoughts and let's decode the future fabric of our existence together! Or you know, just geek out about that mood-shirt, 'cause seriously, Kevin, not cool.

Motivations for getting one: I have a rancilio rocky and a gaggia classic machine at home. The rocky is decent and so is the gaggia but my real problem is that i live with my family. They always fill up the whole bean hopper even though i ask them not to which makes it impossible to single dose my espresso. Having a scale under the Rancilio is also really awkward and for these reasons I'm looking for a handgrinder to replace my Rancilio. I usually drink 1-2 espressos per day and i live in Sweden.

Options: So i recently found a 1zpresso k ultra for only 55 euros on facebook marketplace. It is in full working order and the guy is selling it because he stopped drinking coffee. Is it a good option for me to buy this 55 euro handgrinder instead of a 100 euro second hand 1zpresso j ultra or should i get the cheaper one. I plan on sticking with my grinder for a long time and i will probably some time want to grind for normal coffee even if that will be less frequent.

Basically my question is, is it an adequate option worth the cheap price or should i ""splurge"" on the j-ultra one?

1iq7kzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1iq7kzx/arcana_coffee_procedure_for_morning_delivery_from/,Arcana Coffee: Procedure for Morning Delivery from Erebus Trading & Holdings,"**Document Status:** Active  
**Document Type:** Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)  
**Intended Audience:** Shift Leads, Managers  
**Incident Reporting Contact:** Logistics, ext. 9832  
**Risk Rating**: Low; failure states are well-documented and have manageable remediation procedures.  
**Revision Number:** 5.39

¬†

**Introduction**

This procedure details the protocols necessary to receive morning deliveries from *Erebus Trading & Holdings*. The practices outlined in this procedure are designed to:

* Ensure uninterrupted stock of *Erebus* goods
* Fulfill *Arcana Coffee*‚Äôs contractual obligations with *Erebus Trading & Holdings*
* Provide for the safety and security of all participants

Protocols detailed below are meant to be fulfilled exactly as written unless noted otherwise. Failure to adhere to the protocols will have adverse effects. Note that not all failure states have been documented and that consequences beyond those outlined here are possible. Please read and familiarize yourself with the entire procedure before executing it.

¬†

**Special Notes**

**NOTE 1: THIS PROCEDURE IS FOR MORNING DELIVERIES ONLY. TO COMPLETE DELIVERIES AT OTHER TIMES, USE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURE. FAILURE TO USE THE CORRECT PROCEDURE CAN RESULT IN VIOLATION OF CONTRACT WITH EREBUS TRADING & HOLDINGS - OFTEN RESULTING IN STRICT PENALTIES INCLUDING TERMINATION.**

NOTE 2: As with all interactions with outside vendors, all participants in this procedure are, for the purposes of our agreements with the outside vendor, considered wholly empowered Agents of *Arcana Coffee* and are subject to the associated covenants.

NOTE 3: All deviation incidents must be logged in Form INC-29 within 12 hours. Failure to do so puts other team members at risk and is subject to penalties including termination.

¬†

**Preparation**

1: Enter **Receiving Bay #3** alone and close the door behind you. By contract, deliveries are to be received by 1 representative only.

2: Wash hands, arms, and face thoroughly using the provided **Angelica Root Soap**. This will help mitigate outside contamination and will make you less appealing to visiting entities.

3: Remove any debris or other objects from the **Receiving Circle**. Note: If there is blood (dried or otherwise) in the **Receiving Circle**, do not attempt to remove it. Contact Logistics (ext. 9832) and do not continue with the procedure until Logistics has informed you it is safe to do so. Blood is a likely indicator of a previous failed delivery and a new delivery should not be attempted without remediation.

4: Inspect the **Receiving Circle** and verify that the markings have not been altered. Refer to **Supplementary Document E-Rit-312** for a diagram of the correct markings. If the markings have been altered, Contact Logistics (ext. 9832) and do not continue with the procedure until Logistics has informed you it is safe to do so. Incorrect markings will lead to unpredictable results during the transfer.

5: Gather the required **Components** listed below. All **Components** should be available in the **Receiving Bay**. If any are missing, you may retrieve them from **Component Storage #1.** If you have to leave the room for any reason, including to retrieve **Components**, be sure to close the door behind you and begin the procedure again from Step 1 when you return.  
*Note: There have been documented cases of entities removing* ***Components*** *from the* ***Receiving Bay*** *and altering the* ***Receiving Circle*** *while new* ***Components*** *are retrieved to deceive team members into completing a malformed procedure. In general, if you cannot find an item in a place where it ought to be, caution against extraplanar deception is warranted.*

* 3x Tapered candles (any color is acceptable, but they must all be the same color)
* 3x 2-meter lengths of cotton string
* 1x Oven mitts
* 3x Sulfur matches (cannot be substituted for lighters or other firestarting means)
* 1x Supplementary Document E-Rit-21
* 2 liters water (tap is acceptable)
* 1x Arcana Coffee-roasted coffee bean (must have been roasted on-site)
   * Note: do not bring other Arcana Coffee products into the **Receiving Bay**. They will be interpreted as an additional offering.
* 1x Payment satchel (to be provided by Manager-on-duty)

¬†

**Procedure**

6: Place the **Payment Satchel** on the central symbol of the **Receiving Circle**. Ensure the symbol is entirely covered by the **Payment Satchel**.

* If this is not done properly, the ritual may seek additional payment. The **Angelica Root Soap** should make you or your body parts a less appealing option, but this is not guaranteed.

7: Taking care not to step inside the **Receiving Circle**, place 1 **Candle** each into the northern, southwestern, and southeastern receptacles.

* If you step into the **Receiving Circle** after the first **Candle** has been placed for any reason, you will be considered a **Component** in the ritual. Remove all **Candles** and contact Logistics (ext. 9832) using the **Receiving Bay** phone. DO NOT open the door to the **Receiving Bay** until Logistics has informed you it is safe to do so.

8: Tie loops at both ends of all 3 **2-meter lengths of Cotton String** and place the loops around the candles, forming a triangle shape. Adjust the knots to ensure no part of the **String** is touching the floor.

* If at any point, anything happens to a **String** that is not documented in this procedure (e.g. it is broken, it falls to the floor, it catches fire, it is pulled in any direction), douse the affected **String** with the **Water** and re-apply the **Angelica Root Soap** to all exposed skin before using the **Receiving Bay** phone to contact Logistics (ext. 9832). DO NOT open the door to the **Receiving Bay** until Logistics has informed you it is safe to do so.

9: Stand on the south side of the southeastern **Candle**. Light one of the **Sulfur Matches** and hold it vertically in your left hand. Read aloud the incantation marked ‚Äú—£Œøœü œ´œ≤ ·¥àœ°œüŒøœ°œü‚Äú in **Supplementary Document E-Rit-21** and use the **Sulfur Match** (still in your left hand) to light the southeastern **Candle**. If this is done properly, the flame from the **Match** will move entirely from the **Match** to the **Candle.**

* If you fail to recite the incantation correctly, do not attempt to correct yourself. Remove all **Components** and start the procedure from the beginning.
* If you fail to recite the incantation in its entirety before the **Match** burns down, remove all **Components** and start the procedure from the beginning.
* If the flame continues to exist on the **Match** once the **Candle** is lit, remove all **Components** and start the procedure from the beginning.
* If a flame at any point takes on an unnatural color, douse it with the **Water** and break the **Candle** and/or **Match** in half. Remove all **Components** and start the procedure from the beginning.

10: Stand on the south side of the southwestern **Candle**. Light one of the **Sulfur Matches** and hold it vertically in your left hand. Read aloud the incantation marked ‚ÄúÕΩ∆øŒøÍûáœü œ´œ≤ ÕΩÍ≠æŒøœ°œü‚Äú in **Supplementary Document E-Rit-21** and use the **Sulfur Match** (still in your left hand) to light the southwestern **Candle**. If this is done properly, the flame from the **Match** will move entirely from the **Match** to the **Candle.**

* Observe the warnings from Step 9 of this procedure.

11: Stand on the north side of the northern **Candle**. Light one of the **Sulfur Matches** and hold it vertically in your left hand. Read aloud the incantation marked ‚ÄúÕΩ—äŒø∆ûœü œ´œ≤ ·¥¶Œø∆ø—Ø≈ãŒøÍûá∆π‚Äú in **Supplementary Document E-Rit-21** and use the **Sulfur Match** (still in your left hand) to light the northern **Candle**. If this is done properly, the flame from the **Match** will move entirely from the **Match** to the **Candle.**

* Observe the warnings from Step 9 of this procedure.

12: The centerpoint of each of the 3 **Strings** should now catch fire and begin to burn towards each **Candle.** Step away from the **Receiving Circle**. Time for the **Strings** to be completely burned varies. Times from 1 minute to 27 minutes have been observed.

* If the flames on the strings extinguish themselves, douse any remaining flames with the **Water**, remove all **Components** and inform the Manager-on-duty that the delivery request has been rejected.
* If the **Strings** fall to the ground once they begin burning, exit the **Receiving Bay** IMMEDIATELY, being sure to close the door behind you. Inform the Manager-on-duty of the event. If you experience any burning sensations in the 24 hours following this incident, contact Logistics (ext. 9832) immediately. Do not attempt to seek medical care.
* If the **Strings** continue to burn without the flame reaching the **Candles** for more than 10 minutes, contact Logistics (ext. 9832) using the **Receiving Bay** phone. When connected, say ‚ÄúThe morning delivery is delayed.‚Äù and hang up immediately. Say nothing else. Do not wait for a response. You are being observed.

13: Crack the **Coffee Bean** (into at least 2 pieces, but more are acceptable) and toss it into the center of the **Receiving Circle**, ensuring all pieces remain within the **Receiving Circle**.

* If any of the tossed **Bean** pieces and land outside of the **Receiving Circle**, do not attempt to place them back inside. Once the procedure is complete, inform the Manager-on-duty that today‚Äôs delivery will be short.
* If any pieces of **Bean** are ejected from the **Receiving Circle** by a force you did not initiate, consume the ejected piece immediately. This will prevent outside entities from attempting to leave the circle to reclaim it.

14: Once the flames of the **Strings** reach the **Candles**, close your eyes as the flames will briefly flare brightly. When the flare subsides, the **Candles**, **Strings**, **Bean** pieces, and **Payment Satchel** should no longer be present. The Delivery should now be present in the center of the **Receiving Circle**. It is now safe to enter the **Receiving Circle**.

* If any of the **Components** remain, even if the Delivery is present, DO NOT enter the **Receiving Circle**. Contact Logistics (ext. 9832) on the **Receiving Bay** phone immediately. DO NOT open the door to the **Receiving Bay** until Logistics has informed you it is safe to do so.
* If the flare does not subside within 1 second, douse yourself with the **Water.** This should save you from the worst of the burns. DO NOT open your eyes until the flare has subsided. DO NOT open the door to the **Receiving Bay** until the flare has subsided. Inform the Manager-on-duty of the incident.

15: Put on the **Oven Mitts** and retrieve the Delivery to shield yourself from heat and any lingering traces. You may now exit the **Receiving Bay**.",2,1739643610.0,Ruleshorror,2,1.0,False

When Taylor asked me out to dinner, I knew what was going to happen. Same thing that always happened when I went on a date. I really liked her, though. I thought maybe that could make a difference. 

Maybe, if I tried hard enough, I could just ignore it - just ignore *her*. 

I was wrong. 

\-------

Seated across from my date in the candlelit restaurant, I felt my phantom itch begin to flare up, setting the small of my back on fire. Taylor had been recounting her time in the police academy, but I couldn't follow what she was saying. The discomfort broke my concentration. As the itch's burning pleads intensified, my eyes darted around the dining room, horrified by what was appearing around me.

As expected, I had begun seeing the face everywhere.

It was in the pattern of our server‚Äôs tie, as well as on the red tablecloth beside me, formed from a very particular set of creases. It was on Taylor‚Äôs plate, as the arrangement of her half-eaten veal parmesan had created the image of a single bulging eye above a hooked nose.

Forcefully, I scratched at small of my back, all the while maintaining eye contact with Taylor, trying to keep this date afloat. Judging by her newly furrowed brow, I appeared to be doing a terrible job at hiding my distress. 

My clipped fingernails clawed at the burning patch of skin, over and over again, left to right and then right to left, drawing a few drops of blood in the process. It was no use. No matter what I did, the sensation refused to yield.

The itch always gets worse when the face is around, and the face always comes around when I‚Äôm on a date.

Frustrated, I gave up on relieving the itch and brought my hand back to the table, accidentally knocking over my glass of Pinot Noir with the side of my wrist. It splashed onto my white napkin, staining it with the start of a familiar pattern. Taylor sprung to action, grabbing her napkin to help clean up the mess, but I intercepted her hand.

*‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶wait a second,‚Äù* I mumbled, eyes glued to the developing spill.

As the liquid lost momentum, I saw it; a crisply detailed face, framed by the white material like an impromptu watercolor painting or a purple-red Rorschach Test.

It was the same face that had haunted me since I was nineteen. The same snaggle-toothed smirk with the same bulging right eye, accompanied by the same sharply hooked nose connecting those two features.

*There she is,* I thought to myself.

Nervous sweat dripped down my face like condensation falling off a cold glass of lemonade on a sweltering day. I felt my lips quiver as I spoke, forming shaky words.

*‚ÄúTaylor‚Ä¶I understand how this sounds, but‚Ä¶do you see anything on the napkin? Like‚Ä¶anything recognizable?‚Äù* I asked without looking up, gaze still fixed on the horrible stain.

*‚ÄúUhm‚Ä¶well, turn it towards me.‚Äù*

When I finally looked at her, she was squinting at the napkin, studying the crimson design. For a moment, I was gripped by a profound twinge of embarrassment, anxious thoughts popping into my head like rapidly growing weeds.

*Taylor‚Äôs a gorgeous, intelligent, remarkably kind woman. And I‚Äôm completely blowing my chance to make us into something. Don‚Äôt scare her off.*

A subtle change in her expression pulled me out of my self-loathing; a small tilt of her head complemented by a flicker of her eyes. It might have been recognition. She might have truly seen the face.

But I didn‚Äôt remain at that table long enough to ask.

As I blinked, Taylor‚Äôs face instantly disappeared, seamlessly replaced by the horrific visage I was asking if she could see in the stain. My body trembled with that one protruding eye glaring at me, bloodshot capillaries writhing like thin snakes under the white membrane. Before I could even think, a familiar phrase slipped out of the corner of her mouth, snaggletooth wiggling as those two familiar words became airborne.

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre mine.‚Äù*

I let loose a scream, falling from my chair and onto the ground. Taylor jumped out from the table, rushing over to me with a look of concern painted on her *actual* face, but I was inconsolable. Wild with fear, I turned from her and started to run, briefly traversing the carpet on all fours like a rabid animal. By the time I was sprinting out of the restaurant, I had gotten to my feet, panting ragged breaths as I slid into the front seat of my car and sped off.

\-------

That was three months ago. She ended up paying for both of our meals. Not only that, but she had to Uber home since I had driven her there.

Needless to say, Taylor didn‚Äôt reach out to arrange a second date. 

There was one tiny silver lining, thankfully. Although we both work for the police department, our positions infrequently overlapped. I work in forensics, and she‚Äôs a uniformed officer. The times we did see each other, both assigned to the same crime scene, Taylor would give me a weak smile with a polite wave, and I would somberly reciprocate the gesture back at her.

Just another potential relationship ruined by my pareidolia.

\--------

Pareidolia: ***noun,*** \[pair-ahy-**doh**\-lee-*uh*\]

1) a situation in which someone sees a pattern or image of something that does not exist, for example, a face in a cloud.

\--------

I first saw that face about a decade ago, back when an actual person possessed it.

When I was nineteen, my family moved to a small town near my college. I didn‚Äôt love the arrangement. I mean, what freshman wants to be living with their parents? But I wasn‚Äôt paying my way through undergraduate, so I had little room to complain.

Ms. Besthet lived in the house across from us. From what I understand, she had been perfectly normal before we moved in. A pillar of the community, even.

She was in her late forties and worked as a professor of literary studies at my college. She went to church every Sunday, and she donated a quarter of her salary to the local children‚Äôs hospital. Ms. Besthet was childless and unmarried, but that was the only societal deficiency in her otherwise perfect record.

I never met *that* woman, though. I met someone else about a week after we moved in.

While unpacking my bedroom upstairs, I heard my mom calling me. She hollered for me to come down - one of our new neighbors had stopped by to introduce herself.

Jogging down the stairs, I followed the scent of freshly brewed coffee into the kitchen. Ms. Besthet was sitting at our table, her back to me as I approached.

*‚ÄúOh! And here he is now. This is my son, Grant,‚Äù* my mother remarked, lifting her mug and pointing it in my direction.

The middle-aged woman shifted in her chair, turning to meet me. At first, her expression was unremarkable; warm and friendly, nothing more. But when our eyes met, something changed. Ms. Besthet‚Äôs face twisted into a picture of ecstatic bliss. Her cheeks became rosy and flushed. Her eyes beamed, gleaming with undiluted euphoria. I think I even saw a tear trickle down the side of her nose before the effects of the stroke started to appear.

Love at first sight and its collateral damage, I guess.

As her brain swelled and suffocated, completely deprived of oxygen, Ms. Besthet‚Äôs face contorted from elation into the ghastly expression that has tormented me for the last ten years.

Without a word, she collapsed to the floor. My mother screamed for me to stay with Ms. Besthet as she hurried out of the kitchen, running to call 9-1-1 from her cell phone that had been charging in the living room.

Paralyzed from the abject horror of it all, I found myself unable to leave Ms. Besthet‚Äôs side, even though I certainly wanted to. Instead, I just stared at her, wondering if this odd woman was really about to die in front of me. Two words escaped from her lips before she lost consciousness, whispered from her crumpled position on the ground, her single open eye fixed squarely on me.

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre mine.‚Äù*

\--------

Ms. Besthet didn‚Äôt die that day, but when she returned home from the hospital a month later, she was a different person, apparently.

To this day, I can‚Äôt figure out whether the stroke caused her newfound obsession, some bizarre manifestation of her brain damage, or whether her newfound obsession caused the stroke, desire short-circuiting her nervous system like an old car battery. I suppose the order doesn‚Äôt actually matter. Whatever happened that day, the end result was the same.

The woman had become downright infatuated with me.

Every afternoon, I‚Äôd see her at her front window, curtains wide open, waiting for me to return from class, anchoring her gaze to me the second I stepped out of my car. The stroke had damaged her nerves, leaving the left half of her face paralyzed. Meaning that, when she stared at me, it‚Äôd only be through her right eye, bulging from how intensely she was watching.

Months later, once her strength had more or less returned, Ms. Besthet resumed teaching at my college. Tried to resume teaching, at least. Sometimes she‚Äôd actually show up to her classes, sometimes she wouldn‚Äôt. As it would happen, the sessions she missed were during the times that I was also on campus. Instead of attending her own lectures, I‚Äôd catch her peering at me from around hallway corners or through the cracks of slightly opened doors, always scampering away once I caught on to her enamored surveillance.

The college didn‚Äôt fire her. Instead, without warning, she voluntarily resigned. The day after she quit, Ms. Besthet went missing. Disappeared without a trace. Didn‚Äôt pack a bag, didn‚Äôt take her car. She just vanished.

Many of my neighbors were worried sick, while I was secretly relieved. I didn‚Äôt care where she had gone, and I wasn‚Äôt preoccupied with the possibility that something bad had happened to her.

Wherever she was, Ms. Besthet was finally leaving me alone. 

Or she was being less obvious about it, at least.

A few quiet weeks passed before I heard a loud *thump* on our living room window, home alone while my parents were out of town. I had fallen asleep on the couch watching a movie, but the strange noise yanked me awake. My eyes, still hazy from sleep, looked over to a nearby digital clock, which showed it was two in the morning. As my vision became clearer, I noticed something that made the hairs on the nape of my neck stand on end.

I saw the faint silhouette of a person, leaning against the living room window from the outside. Not only that, but they had pressed their body so hard against the glass that the sound of it had woken me up.

Terror vibrating in the back of my throat, I crept over to the window. The bright flickering images from our wide-screen TV cast inky shadows that danced over me as I moved through the room. When I finally stood in front of the silhouette, inches away from the glass, my entire body buzzed with fear and anticipation.

I twisted the blinds open.

But, to my surprise, there was no one there. All I saw through that window was an empty cul-de-sac, dimly lit by phosphorescent streetlights.

An involuntary sigh of relief billowed from my lungs, and I let the tension in shoulders fall like an avalanche of muscle and ligament down below my collarbone.

The relief didn‚Äôt last.

When I was about to turn away, I noticed a smudge on the glass. It wasn‚Äôt easy to see in the low light, but once I saw it, I couldn‚Äôt look away. I tried to suppress my recognition of the shape, but it was too perfectly identical to be anything other than an imprint of Ms. Besthet‚Äôs face.

Two months later, some kids stumbled upon a decomposing body in the woods behind my house.

According to the police, it looked like Ms. Besthet had been living there since her disappearance. The authorities eventually ruled her death a tragic accident; starvation in the setting of psychosis.

I wouldn‚Äôt learn this until years later, but the only thing she had on her person when she expired was a polaroid camera. A detective that worked the case let that fact slip in passing, gushing about how strange it all was, unaware that I lived less than a hundred yards from where the woman had simply laid down and died.

When I asked him if she had any photos with her, he refused to tell me more.

*""I've said too much already, sorry.""*

\--------

From a dating perspective, my twenties have been hellish. Echoes of Ms. Besthet‚Äôs face have stalked me since the day she died. Under normal circumstances, it‚Äôs an infrequent disturbance. Once a month, maybe. But if I ever find myself flirting, though, imprints of her face will start proliferating in my surroundings, swirling around me like a swarm of wasps.

And if I‚Äôm ever stupid enough to actually go on a date? Multiply all of that by twenty.

Not to mention the goddamned itch. In the end, that‚Äôs what really stopped me from pursuing romance. I think I could ignore the faces; however numerous they‚Äôd become. It‚Äôd be difficult, but I could do it. The itch is a different story. At peak intensity, it‚Äôs like my skin is burning from an invisible fire that won‚Äôt go out. The discomfort can completely overwhelm me to the point where I would do anything to make it stop.

So, I‚Äôve resigned myself to isolation. Dating just hasn‚Äôt been worth the pain. It‚Äôs been lonely, sure, but abstaining has kept me safe and relatively sane. Meeting Taylor, however, changed things. Taylor rekindled something inside me that I believed was completely extinguished before I met her. She made me want to fight back.

That was delusional.

A misjudgment I won‚Äôt be making again.

\--------

Over the last two weeks, I‚Äôve been daydreaming about Taylor. We‚Äôve had some casual conversations since that disaster of a first date, and I realized that I‚Äôve given her nothing in the way of an explanation for my behavior that night.

Yesterday, though, I made a resolution.

I would ask Taylor to meet me for coffee the day *after* Valentine‚Äôs Day. Asking her to coffee *on* Valentine‚Äôs Day would be a little strange, I thought. I didn‚Äôt plan on explaining everything to her, but I could at least apologize for leaving her high and dry. Maybe pay her back for dinner and the Uber. If she seemed receptive to all that, and if I found a bit of courage, maybe I‚Äôd ask her if she was willing to give us another try.

Satisfied with the plan, I continued through my workday.

A few hours later, I was called in to assist with a case - a dead body discovered in the middle of a nearby park that had everyone scratching their heads.

When I arrived on scene, I understood their confusion.

The corpse was propped up against a tree, its details initially obscured by the tree‚Äôs shadow. Honestly, it was hard to even tell it was a human body from where I parked, which was only twenty feet away. At that distance, the thing looked more like a burlap sack filled with ground beef than it did a human cadaver.

When I approached, however, I started to appreciate its humanity. A fractured bone jutting out here, a few fingers poking out there. Somehow, the corpse had been twisted into an incomprehensible sphere of mangled flesh and bone. It was like God had taken this poor soul, placed them between the palms of their comet-sized hands, and rolled them until they were molded into a ball like human pizza dough.

But that wasn‚Äôt even the strangest part: the corpse lacked decay, meaning that whoever they were, they were freshly dead. Our lead detective had initially assumed that we were standing on the crime scene, given how recently we had presumed they died. At the same time, the scene was *completely* bloodless, which argued against that theory. Not a speck of it on them, not a speck of it around the tree.

No blood that we could see, at least. Despite what we all see in the movies, blood sprays aren‚Äôt always obvious.

I opened my forensics toolbag and pulled a spray bottle of luminol from it. If there was even a drop to be found, the chemical would react with it, oxidizing the molecular iron present in blood, resulting in a faint blue glow. Thankfully, the large tree‚Äôs shadow completely covered the victim. To properly see the glow, I needed the area to be dark.

As the liquid contacted the corpse, parts of it did glow. 

Moments later, the lead detective put a gentle hand on my shoulder and said something that nearly caused me to pass out. I hadn‚Äôt heard him approach, transfixed by the shape that had appeared after I sprayed the luminol.

*‚ÄúWe found the victim‚Äôs wallet in the nearby brush. I think‚Ä¶I think you knew her.‚Äù*

I didn‚Äôt need him to continue, but I didn‚Äôt stop him, either. When I saw the imprint of Ms. Besthet‚Äôs face glowing on the corpse like a cosmic stamp of approval, I already knew what he was about to tell me.

*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶it‚Äôs Taylor.‚Äù*

My memory of the next few minutes is a bit jumbled. I have a very fuzzy recollection of driving home. It consists mostly of my own feral screams filling the car with unearthly noise, rather than a memory of the drive itself.

Everything becomes clear again when I walked through the door of my apartment. As soon as my foot passed that threshold, I felt the phantom itch abruptly manifest on the small of my back, worse than it‚Äôs ever been before. Struggling to move, I stumbled through my apartment, scratching wildly at the area as I did, clawing at the skin with reckless abandon. Eventually, I made my way into the bathroom.

As I unbuttoned my shirt, an entirely new pain came into being. It wasn‚Äôt the pins and needles of an unmanaged itch; the discomfort was too sharp. It caused me to double over in agony, leaning my elbow against the rim of the sink to keep myself upright. I wasn't even scratching anymore, and yet the pain was still escalating, as if I was manually peeling thick strips of meat from around my spine with my hands. I felt the tearing sensation making a line across my skin, inch by tortuous inch.

In a frenzy, I ripped my shirt off and turned my back towards the mirror, desperate to identify the source of the new pain. What I witnessed in that moment broke me completely.

A laceration was forming, completely on its own, unzipping layers of skin before my eyes, the tissue audibly splitting and popping in my ears.

Above the impossible wound, there was a single brown mole about the size of a nickel. There was also an old scar from a biking injury, below the mole but above the laceration; a fibrinous line running between the two landmarks, connecting them to each other like an interstate highway.

An eye, a hooked nose, and a bloody smirk.

As I noticed it, the lacerating paused, and the room became quiet.

I watched helplessly as the lips of the gash began moving, causing jolts of debilitating pain to radiate through my back, silently mouthing those two horrible words.

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre mine.‚Äù*

1iq7i6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/1iq7i6h/first_week_of_cpap_insane_gains/,First week of CPAP - insane gains,"Ive probably had sleep apnea since late teens thinking back on symptoms and my general mental state and now after 25 years ive got diagnosed with moderate sleep apnea. My stats were 11 AHI on side 30 on back, so they estimated it at moderate, lowest O2 sat 82%.

First night with CPAP i had 0,8 AHI. I woke up 100% rested and sharp. I cant really remember last time i had this mental capacity but probably in my teens. That day at work i had racing thoughts, crystal clear focus on tasks and just insane capacity.   
The whole week went well i had 0,9 average AHI, 7 hours of sleep. 

These are the benefits right now:

* mental capacity to focus on tasks for 6 hours straight, previously i had to rest every 20-30 minutes
* memory is better, i have a clear idea on what i did every day almost by the hour the last week. I can think back onwhat tasks i did. Before i had an average idea on what i did that day otherwise i had to double check
* Not mentally tired at all from 06.00 - 23.00, its weird to feel physically tired in my body but not mentally it was always the other way around
* Libido spiked, i feel 20 years younger
* Hunger is gone, i feel fuller and just content 5 hours after a meal
* Coffee, which i had 6-10 cups a day (managed to reduce it to 2 cups after a flue) is now like drugs because im allready so awake the effect is tenfold
* Ive gone from introverted and inattentive to beign very sociable. It seems like i didnt have the mental capacity to be social before. Im reevaluating my character...
* Racing thoughts and having trouble with impulsive behaviour. Now my brain seems to be on speed so ive made some bad decisions, which i instantly regretted afterwards. I definately need to rethink and double check some decisions i make. I wonder if i actually have problem with impulse control which was controlled by mental degradation from sleep apnea...

How has everyone elses treatment affected them? Anyone had similar changes? I assume what i feel now will be my new baseline in a year but it would be nice to feel like the main character of limitless before. Im looking forward to just spend a week studying math or something, which i had struggled with a lot because of the inability to mentally focus.
