Sometimes during light or heavy meteor showers, Celeste has a change to appear at night. Everytime she is on your island, there is a chance she shows up at your roost for coffee! 

Whenever special characters are here for coffee, they say things they won't say anywhere else! This can include information on themselves or other characters!

1kdaj2o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kdaj2o,NKD + Japan Shopping Experience: Togashi W2 Lefty Deba & Sakai Takayuki Knife Gallery,"Hello again TCK!

I‚Äôm back with another NKD and Japan knife shopping experience post. This time, it‚Äôs Sakai Takayuki Knife Gallery and my new deba.

*First, the knife:*

Being a lefty, single bevels at one point felt unobtainable, but once I caught the bug, I really came to love single bevels. Now, this Deba rounds out my lefty single bevel collection alongside my yanagiba (Nakagawa x Manzo W3/Iron) and usuba (Togashi W2/Iron). 

This is my Sakai Takayuki Tokujyo Lefty Deba 135mm with a Shirogami #2 core clad in soft iron. It is forged by Kenji Togashi-san and sharpened by Kenya Togashi-san. The handle is Ho wood with a buffalo horn ferrule. 

The actual measurements are 143mm of blade length and 44mm tall with a spine that starts out at ~5mm thick and tapered to ~3.5mm thick at the shinogi line before reaching the tip. It weighs a fairly light 164 grams. 

I‚Äôve been butchering small fish with my Matsubara Ginsan Honesuki but having this little guy is going to make that job more enjoyable. Plus, I now have all three main Japanese single bevel knives so I can really work on dialing in my knife skills with each as well. My partner grabbed the Mukoita cutting techniques cookbook and it‚Äôs been a blast relearning through Japanese methods. A huge part of that is fish butchery which is likely to be a new hobby of mine going forward. 

The fit and finish isn‚Äôt magnificent, but it‚Äôs a tool so how can I blame them? Plus, it doesn‚Äôt look bad! Every aspect of it seems to be purely focused toward one goal of butchering fish. There are no demerits, but it‚Äôs clear aesthetic design wasn‚Äôt really the No.1 priority. That being said, I might round out the spine and choil one of these days. I haven‚Äôt used it yet, but I can already tell it‚Äôs a tad sharp around the spine and choil.

I chose this one because my usuba is from the same line and it is flawless. It can be hard trusting single bevels, especially lefty options, but the performance of my usuba gave me confidence to grab another W2 Togashi. 

*Secondly, shopping at Sakai Takayuki Knife Gallery:*

First off, it‚Äôs good to tell people that you need to buy a ticket to visit the knife gallery. I believe it was about $15 USD per person and it includes a soft drink or coffee. So book it ahead of time and I‚Äôd do it later in the day so you can shop around Sakai before heading here. Also, use that chance to tell them what you might be looking for. When I arrived, they already pulled out a few lefty debas to look at. 

Once inside, it‚Äôs a stunning space. The knives all over the wall, the sword at the end of the hallway, the cases in the showroom and every other inch of the space was beautiful. The chairs were comfy, the sales people were really kind and even knew English pretty well. 

The knives were a bit expensive, but there were some gems. There were a bunch of Doi-san knives available (last pic), tons of engraved options done by Michiko-san, and quite a few fancy-handled VG10 factory knives. If you want a place to drool over engraving, have a coffee, grab a knife as a gift, and maybe grab a knife for yourself, it‚Äôs a wonderful space. Definitely come here if you‚Äôre curious about single bevel knives too; the selection was probably the best I saw on my trip. 

The prices being a bit high definitely hurt the overall score, but I‚Äôd still make time to visit; even if you‚Äôre not getting a knife. It‚Äôs a really cool space with wonderful people helping you. I wouldn‚Äôt say it is a ‚Äòmust visit‚Äô level, but just below that. Plus, it‚Äôs really close to everywhere else most people plan to go so why not squeeze it in? 

I‚Äôll give it a 7.5/10 overall. We enjoyed ourselves and it was cool to see a location dedicated to keeping Sakai knife making going. 

I‚Äôll be back soon with a few other Japan Shopping Experience posts soon. See you then, TCK ü´°  ",1,1746216570.0,TrueChefKnives,0,1.0,False

Then there‚Äôs that deep cosmic dread that shows up uninvited‚Äîanxiety maybe, or maybe a glimpse into something way bigger and way less friendly.

I‚Äôve been poking around these ideas through a weird novel: Insane Entities. It's experimental and totally non-linear (some called it ‚Äúblasphemous‚Äù on Goodreads). It plays with death, uncertainty, and realities folding into each other. Honestly feels like it should come with a warning: Best Read While Slightly Disoriented.

1kdaeqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/coparenting/comments/1kdaeqb/struggling_with_separation/,Struggling with separation,"
My daughter is 14 months old. Her father and I separated when she was 11 months. Before the separation.. I was a stay-at-home mom and have been with her since birth. Even before the separation, I felt like I was doing most of the parenting on my own (bathing her, feeding her, putting her to sleep, playing with her, changing her) Since we split, she‚Äôs been with me full-time. Her dad visits occasionally, either while I‚Äôm present or sometimes I leave her with him for a couple of hours, about once a week.

I do believe it‚Äôs important for her to have a relationship with her father. I want him to be more involved and maybe having her stay overnight.. However, I have concerns about leaving her alone with him. I worry that he might not know how to care for her properly, and that he might rely on his mother to help. We come from a Hispanic culture, I‚Äôve seen how his mom tends to take over, she would cook for him, make his coffee, do his laundry, etc. once the baby was born she would want to change her diapers or feed her which I wasn't to comfortable about.. but I'm afraid she would take over and not give him the chance to take real responsibility for our daughter.

Lately, I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about this. I'm not sure whether we should share our daughter but I also don't like the idea that she will be jumping from house to house in such a small age... I want my daughter to spend time with her dad, but I‚Äôm unsure how that would affect her emotionally and mentally. She still relies on me, especially at bedtime. For example, one night while she was sleeping, I stepped away to take a shower. She noticed I wasn‚Äôt next to her and started crying intensely. Even though my mom and sister tried to comfort her, she wouldn‚Äôt calm down until I came back and held her. That experience makes me hesitant to leave her for longer periods, even with her dad.",1,1746216253.0,coparenting,1,1.0,False

1kdaeca,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1kdaeca/gallbladder_liver_and_stuck_emotions_gallstones/,"Gallbladder, liver, and stuck emotions. Gallstones?","Hey I am a 25 year old athletic Male. Deal with anxiety, depression, histamine issues, fatigue after eating,  low vitamin D (rarely rises above 44 ng/ml and commonly low 30's), low folate (don't tolerate active folate or folic acid) (Will try folinic very soon). Been having bile dumping symptoms that I can only describe as cathartic. Since 17 I have always been a very stoic person that struggles to cry or process grief. Things have always felt 'stuck.' I have accidentally had a few incidents where I began bile dumping to the point of having yellow greasy stools. During these times I was wondering what the heck was wrong with me as I would cry and tear up over the silliest of things. But the emotional dumps felt sooo good. I have experienced a lot of stress, grief, and trauma throughout my life but despite therapy I have been unable to 'burst the dam' so to speak on any crying or real deep emotional processing. Processing the bad things has always been quite monotone with no real emotions. Drinking alcohol (once a month maybe) and daily caffeine use are the only true cathartic releases I get as odd as that sounds. I also am exposed to mold (aflotoxin and ochratoxin) and need to remove myself from exposure and recover. I would imagine mold doesn't help bile flow. I did a HIDA scan and it came back with normal bile flow. They didn't spot any gall stones but I have a suspicion that I maybe full of them as I just can't explain the constipation and SIBO/SIFO or candida like symptoms as well. I can't pass stool unless I have coffee or ascorbic acid. Even on a clean diet of fibrous veggies, fat, and meat. Watching the screen on the HIDA scan it was so blurry that I wouldn't have been able to make out any stones. Only bile. They seemed only interested in Bile flow from the liver to the gallbladder. Ejection fraction was 46% I tried increasing my stomach acid through Betaine HCL and even high doses of ascorbic acid. Didn't really notice much improvement. I still deal with a dull pain/stiffness in my RUQ. Liver enzymes look good and just got a lab done today that came back with normal bilirubin. The 'accidental bile dumps' were from supplements I was taking to try and help my liver, gallbladder, and kidneys. I stopped them after a month of use and thats when I began to experience the bile dumping and emotional dam bursting. I came back with high bilirubin at 2.0 shortly after. I was talking to my pastor about how much grief I couldn't process as tears were streaming down my face lol. I felt like an idiot. Been praying alot about this as it is frustrating to watch others cry or move on from grief and trauma while Im stuck at square one because I can't cry or release REAL emotions. I also did a genetic test through 23 and me and had the raw data translated through stratagene. It came back that my PEMT gene is 30% lower in activity and thus could contribute to poor bile flow. The other bile dumping experience I had was pretty dumb circumstances. I went through a tudca/ox bile stage to try and help my constipation. One night I had a decent amount of liqour and then before bed took my usual dose of tudca and ox bile. The next morning I passed a very watery stool repeatedly. The birds could have been singing louder and the sunrise brighter than ever before. Songs on the radio FELT with real emotions. Maybe I experienced what it was like to be a female for a second lol. I could have cried over anything. I wanted to sit and soak in the world and not be disturbed. I have never felt more alive in my soul. Yea....pretty dumb circumstances. But I was bile dumping for sure. Wonder if I passed a stone or something. Maybe it corrected some dysbiosis and I was getting proper neurotransmitters that day. I can only speculate. Am I the only one who experiences this emotionally muted state maybe due to my lack of gallbladder or liver activity? Has anyone else out there experienced emotional release from proper bile flow? Its been a few long years of going down the rabbit holes trying to fix myself. I also understand how much of my symptoms are related to each other.

Taking a break from progressing things to talk about more random details on my setting. All names aren't finalized as is the norm. Hope you all enjoy!


When it comes to the Heralds of the King, I find it best to just go with the flow of whatever new mystery they open without regard for anything. Nowhere is that better exemplified then in the loose collection of trinkets agents have recovered after a Herald attack. 


What they really are, why they exist, and why they are left in the wake of these beings is unknown, as is the trend when dealing with them. What is known is that, occasionally, once the Knight or the Rook has killed whoever they were sent to kill, and cleanup begins, objects have been found at the site. 


What these objects are is random, from an ornate, beautiful war hammer to a literal stereofoam cup, the condition is variable, from fine to broken beyond recognition, but the consistant fact is that they appear to possess unnatural properties, which the reality shifting Heralds would have no need of. 


This report can not explain them all, as several of them are top secret, and several others are unidentifiable heaps of molten slang or billions of pieces of screws and bolts. The following is a quick guide to the most influential of the artifacts, for the exclusive use of members of the Abnormal Human Commission. 


-The reforger: an ornate, to handed war hammer, designed with representations of the biblical 7 days of creation. As it appears, uses of it allows the welder to turn component matter into anything, simply by hitting it. The main caveats being that already assembled objects tend to simply break as expected, that the user needs to have at least some knowledge of what they want to build works (more knowledge=faster construction) and that you can't turn matter into different materials with it. So no alchemy experiments with it.*

(*This is an official document, please refrain from jokes.)


-The health cups: Several boxes of stereofoam cups, emblazoned with a representation of the Greek medical sign, the rod and the snake, with the words 'Aesculapius: So Refreshing It's Lifesaving!'. Pouring different sodas yeald different effects, from healing from red drinks, to orange sodas giving speed boosts, or colas allowing for night vision . Fresh water in the cups will nullify the effects, and coffee and tea appear to have no corresponding ability. Cups lose power after ten drinks. 


-The artbook: a artists notepad, signed E.S. Which seems to interpret intent of the person using it, facilitating incredible drawings in record times. Apppears to have either some sort of, for lack of a better term, programming, as attempts to use it to copy other works usually result in the notepad creating works directly insulting the plagerist. Has been deemed safe enough to reveal to the general public, with its origins classified as per AHC guidelines. 


These 3 objects are emblematic of the useful finds that appear, but are far from the only ones. With appearances of unknowns occurring at a rapid and ever growing pace, more and more artifacts are discovered. And with them, the mystery thickens. Why would someone who has been able to take tank shells need a cup that restores health? Why would someone capable of bending time and space need a hammer that can build anything? Why would someone who's precense causes madness need an art book? And why would they leave them behind?

I quit finally when my daughter was born because I hated myself so much. I had severe chest pains snd terrible energy. I would wake up and straight away sit outside drink coffee and smoke and doom scroll until I got bored of it. I was being a total loser. 
Actually it was a cross road for Me. I knew that I was reaching a point where regrets are made and I was already a little late exiting the highway if I‚Äôm honest. 
Ultimately the fear of being a loser became greater than the pain of quitting smoking . I‚Äôve done 6 months here and there many times but always gone back to heavy smoking eventually. 
I‚Äôm well past even ever thinking about it but I know how hard it was to get to this point. 
It gets easy. It‚Äôs becomes freedom. 


If your struggling with jt, my two cents are this. 
Be a responsible , take on responsibility for whatever  or whoever you need to be there for. 
Use the desire to be a good person as a fuel for you cleaning up your act. Don‚Äôt quit for you, quit for your wife or your children or your mother. 
Quite because you want to give them something more. 
Since I quit my career has taken off. My social skills have sharpened. My body is repairing, 
Everything is flowing. 
I decided to quit alcohol also to experiment with the extra gains. That‚Äôs also been about one year.

1kda8jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1kda8jk/nsclc_and_brain_net_whats_the_disease_trajectory/,NSCLC and Brain NET- what‚Äôs the disease trajectory?,"Hello, if this is not an appropriate venue to ask my question, my apologies; I am just trying to better understand my dad‚Äôs medical situation and I thought this might be a good opportunity to hear from some experts in the field. I made a couple of posts in the initial stages of my dad‚Äòs diagnosis, but I am not savvy enough to figure out how to link them here.

In December 2024, my father (68) was diagnosed with cancer. The cancer was detected due to sudden onset of symptoms (loss of balance, tremors in left hand, slurred speech, vomiting that appeared to be coffee grounds) and a 4 cm mass and 1 cm mass were found in his brain, near the cerebellum. He had surgery within a few days of finding the masses and only the larger one was able to be removed.

They did a full body CT or MRI (can‚Äôt remember which) and there was one nodule on his right lung. My father said he was aware of that nodule and it had been there for a number of years because his GP discovered it on an x-ray and diagnosed as a granuloma. He was asymptomatic, so they followed up every couple of years with a new scan, but treated it like it was a granuloma.

The tumor in his brain was diagnosed as a low grade neuroendocrine tumor. A biopsy of the nodule on his lung revealed that it was, in fact, lung cancer. The specific diagnosis we were given was non-small cell lung cancer, atypical carcinoid type.

He had a G-68 Dotatate PET scan and the only spot that lit up was his lung. There was no visible pathway to the brain (nothing lit up). What does that mean? Is this unusual?

He had stereotactic radiation on his brain first followed by radiation for the lung. He did really well with that and even went back to work but, unfortunately, after a clear scan in August 2024, symptoms quickly reappeared, and by mid September, there were several new spots in his brain that required whole brain radiation.

The whole brain radiation has had an extreme impact on him that has been incredibly difficult to witness. He‚Äôs definitely not the same man he was before. He‚Äôs very weak, has not regained balance more than six months after completing treatment, has suffered memory lapses, cannot care for himself unassisted, cannot even get up to walk. He‚Äôs in bad shape. As a family, we were not prepared for this.

His treatment facility is one that is connected with MD Anderson so I know it‚Äôs a reputable facility. However, I feel like we‚Äôve not been given much information about his specific diagnoses, how the cancers are related if there was no pathway on the G-68 scan, what his prognosis is and why they‚Äôve only opted to treat with radiation, forgoing chemo, even for the lung. Is it typical for families to be in the dark? I feel like we‚Äôre only getting tidbits of information.

For a while, we were told that the cancer in the lung and cancer in the brain were not related. Then, we were told the lung cancer was small cell lung cancer, but then we were told someone on the team made a mistake and he does NOT have SCLC and clarified they are both neuroendocrine cancers, the one on the lung being more aggressive. So the assumption is that they are, in fact, connected.

He‚Äôs never been given a ‚Äústage IV lung cancer‚Äù diagnosis but I‚Äôm pretty sure that that‚Äôs what this is based on what I‚Äôve read.

I understand that every patient is different, but I guess I just don‚Äôt understand protocol for making decisions about what type of information is revealed to patients and families, and what the protocol is for making a decision about treatment options. We also don‚Äôt know trajectory of the disease from here.

My dad is a non-smoker and never had prior symptoms of lung cancer. Since the whole brain radiation, however, he‚Äôs had a lot more phlegm/mucus and does hack and cough quite a bit, but he was told that was could be because of the effects of the radiation. It‚Äôs been 15 months since his initial lung cancer diagnosis and he hasn‚Äôt had another full body scan since to see if there‚Äôs a disease progression anywhere else. I cannot fathom why it has taken this long. 

My mom is his caretaker and she has had ovarian cancer for the past 10 years. She‚Äôs no longer able to tolerate treatment and we almost lost her last summer. I expect we‚Äôre going to lose both parents within a short period of time. We feel kind of in the dark from her medical team, as well, with regard to disease progression and expected trajectory from here.

So, I guess my questions are: What is the general consensus with regard to presenting patients with information about disease progression, anticipated disease trajectory, potential prognosis, etc.? How do medical teams determine what to share with patients and families and when to share it? Given what I‚Äôve told you, does it sound like this is end stage for my dad? I‚Äôm assuming he has only months left at this point but no one has said so and I understand that cannot be predicted.

Lastly, is there any type of genetic testing my brother and I should have, given our father‚Äôs (apparent) Stage IV lung cancer?

If I don‚Äôt get a response, no worries. It was cathartic just to type it all out. Thank you for ‚Äúlistening‚Äù.",1,1746215836.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1kda364,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kda364,(late) april empties!,"big month for my travel sizes üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è i also moved out of my dorm, so i had to throw out the first batch of empties (first photo) and take the second and third photos after i finished packing </3

dr. bronner's castille soap (baby version): i make jokes about how i'd be a 6'1"" frat bro who runs a DKE like the navy in another life, but this proved me wrong. this 18-in-1 soap took me TWO YEARS to finish (hence the condemned-looking cap) and i had to use it as a body wash, makeup brush cleaner, surface cleaner, and laundry detergent to finish it off. it was unscented and highly concentrated, and i honestly really liked it at the end! probably won't repurchase for the time being, though. watch this space for more soap pans, by the way; that seems to be my biggest hoard. 7/10. 

bbw gingerbread latte ffm: i've had this since i was ten years old. i remember digging through the semi-annual sale bins at the bbw in my local mall in january 2016, and my father bought it for me for $5. it was my first ""grown-up"" fragrance product that i didn't borrow from my mother, and i used it so sparingly for the first few months just so i wouldn't go through it too quickly. i didn't have to worry‚Äîi used this as a pillow spray, shower spray, room spray, and to complement my other vanilla perfumes in an effort to use this up before the alcohol scent got too strong to bear, and it STILL took me from september to april to use half the bottle. it honestly still smelled pretty good by the time i finished it. 8/10 for the product, 10/10 including the memories attached. 

mac fix plus (original): my dorm was dry as hell, so my previously combo-oily skin started flaking like crazy. i bought this to melt my makeup together on my face so i wouldn't look like sandman (i've gone through several bottles of fix plus back when i still used a beauty blender to blend my makeup, and i've always been aware that it doesn't do anything to hold makeup in place), but over time, my skin got used to the environmental dryness, so i had to use less of this stuff. 100mL took me from november to april, so that's impressive, i suppose. i've since bought another face mist with a bit more film-forming stuff in it. 6/10. 

caudalie vinoclean cleansing oil: holy grail oil-based cleanser üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è i use five pumps every night and it lasted me four months. i bought a replacement the night before it ran out, and i think i'll be buried with a bottle in my coffin. 10/10. 

neutrogena hydro boost spf 50 sunscreen: rikers for whoever made this, and only because alcatraz is closed. it's greasy, pills like nothing else even in the body, and stains EVERYTHING that comes in contact with it. it literally built up some sort of blue goo in the crooks of my elbows and the creases of my neck. i bought it in a three-pack from Costco last summer, and thank god this was my last one. i will say that it doesn't smell awful, and it's not too hard to blend out, so 3/10. 

goongbe waterful sun lotion spf 50 pa++++: reopen alcatraz for whoever formulated this. i'm so serious right now; this stuff smells weird, made my skin tingle, and ran everywhere, and yes, i may have mildly sensitized skin, but this was a physical sunscreen üíÄand it gave me a white cast. i wear NARS affogato as my summer concealer shade. *it gave me a white cast.* i finished it by using it on my body, but i wasn't happy about it. 1/10. 

molton brown kumudu shampoo: i can't even find the exact product name for this anymore, because my father gave it to me three years ago and said he got it in the 2000s, or something. he doesn't even remember when he got it. anyway, it smelled good. like that summer i spent getting UV poisoning in an outdoor pool and learning to open pomegranates without help. 8/10 because it also weighed down my hair, unfortunately. 

garnier olia after-color care conditioner: this was from a box of garnier hair dye, specifically cherry red. this conditioner smelled like 2022 for me, like the first-floor locker room of my high school and the stench of the drugstore bleach i used to make my hair go from black to red in a single afternoon. i heard the box dye conditioners are supposed to be really good for your hair, or something, but i'm not big on haircare, and this particular tube was definitely expired, so i'm not sure. 7/10 for the memories. 

first aid beauty kp body scrub (strawberry): same as the caudalie cleansing oil. put a tube in my coffin. i bought this the day after i moved into my dorm, and it lasted me until a week before i moved out. what's the opposite of rikers? because whoever made this deserves that. 10/10. 

clarins hand and nail cream: RIKERS FOR WHOEVER MADE THIS üò© there's sesame oil in the formula, and combined with the signature clarins spa-ish scent, my nostrils were violently assaulted every time i tried to use this after painting my nails. i gave up on using it as an after-mani cream, so i cut the tube open and used it as a body butter. 1/10. 

clarins sos hydra face mask: i'm pretty sure this is discontinued??? maybe it's reformulated??? anyway, i felt very pampered when i used this, but other than that, it didn't really do anything. i think it would've been good for someone with drier skin than mine. 5/10. 

versace crystal noir edt 50mL: bless the bottle, bless the juice, bless the perfumer. every press of the atomizer was a religious experience for me, my *lord*. the gingery notes, the amber, the almost soap-like quality of the initial spray...phenomenal. wouldn't repurchase for the time being, but i'm keeping the bottle as a memento. 9/10 (watch for more fragrance empties, because while i can wax romantic about this one for hours, there are others i can be even more insane about.)

clarins body cream: this had a less-offensive smell than the hand cream, so i basically switched them and put this in my purse to use as a hand moisturizer instead. it was fine. plain toast, black coffee, thursday morning fine. 5/10. 

laneige lip sleeping mask (sweet candy): i bought this in 2022, and i was a ride-or-die for it at first, but i eventually realized that i only thought it was so great because i would use it on my lips when they were already hydrated and not-chapped. when they started flaking and bleeding, the mask didn't repair them or anything. it was like applying lip gloss over your lips when you've got scurvy (speaking from experience). 6/10 because it smelled heavenly. 

clarins hydrating gentle foaming cleanser: this was not gentle ;-; this felt very stripping on my combo skin, even after it got out of that lizard-skin phase. but it felt great and as stripping as it was, it got the job done, so 7/10. also, it was the perfect size to put in my bag for long, multi-night adventures. this month was a very sentimental month for my empties. 

nyx epic wear liquid liner (red): jail. straight to jail. the brush was too thin for the product, making it difficult to make a fine line, and it is so waterproof i had to use rubbing alcohol to remove it when i used it on my body. however, i had a series of crashouts over finals, and this stuff never budged an inch, so 4/10 for not making me look like i was crying blood. 

glossier boy brow (dark brown): i had a quick burst of glossier-glazing tendencies right around december last year, and this was one of my first purchases from that phase. this brow product was really nice!! towards the end, it got a little harder to use, and it pulled a little warmer than i usually like, but other than that, it was a really good re-introduction into brow gel-pomades for me. i bought another product to replace it because this was my last brow product at the time of finishing (which is the case for a lot of my empties, honestly). 8/10. 

avalon & gray luxury facial soap: that's the little square sticker hovering next to the boy brow tube. father strikes again; he gave this to me brand-new (shrink-wrapped, even) and said that maybe i would need it if i were to travel. i teared up a little bit, honestly. anyway, avalon & gray is a hotel toiletries brand from the 90s that isn't available anymore?? it may alarm you to know that, yes, i used it on my face, and yes, it *does* work well as a facial cleanser. my skin's pretty clear, for all those wondering. all this mystery skincare and sunscreen didn't melt my face off, or anything. 8/10. 

mac lip pencil (stripdown): i bought this in 2022 when i ran out of my then-ride-or-die, mufe's endless cacao. mac's lip pencils are a little dry at first, but good lord, do they stay put. anyway, this is done, just a temporary fling, and i've been reunited with my dearly-beloved endless cacao. 9/10, though. if i weren't already spoken for, i'd probably have converted. 

dior diorshow maximizer 4D lash primer: i have long-ish but straight lashes, which means i swear by using a lash curler before applying mascara, which also means a lash primer doesn't do anything for me that my curler doesn't do as well. either way, this little travel tube was nice when i needed an excuse to take an extra minute getting ready before facing whomever it was i was dreading seeing. ""oh, my god, don't rush me, let me prime my lashes-uh!!!!"" 3/10. 

clarins total eye lift eye cream: i used this whenever i wanted to feel like i was in vogue beauty secrets. it didn't do anything, and i didn't expect it to, since i don't really have wrinkles around my eye area. ???/10. 

mac powder kiss lipstick (mull it over): i loved this thing to bits. it was so soft, so buttery, so blurry on the lips, and looked good with everything. the component, however, got weirdly sticky???? and i know that's just what happens with packaging that has that buttery-matte sort of coating on it, and it wasn't a dealbreaker, but i can still feel that stickiness in my fingertips when i close my eyes. 7/10. 

cezanne powder eyebrow brow powder duo (charcoal gray): got this from my mother in 2021 after i over-plucked my brows and needed something to fix it. she bought it in japan in 2018, so this has been around for a while. i didn't use it as a brow powder, though, mostly because i don't have any grays (yet). i used it as an eyeshadow duo RELIGIOUSLY after i got into my little 90s glam phase. proud to call this my first-ever eyeshadow palette empty, even though that's definitely cheating. 6/10. 

aesop rejuvenate intensive body balm: i take back every joke i've ever made about australia's plate-sized spiders, because aesop's presence in my life more than makes up for the abomination that is australia's collection of spiders. this cream smells like vanilla and citrus. it's moisturizing without being heavy, a little goes a long way, and the tube is so aesthetically pleasing. it doubles as a hand cream. i can bathe in this and die happy. in fact, it breaks my heart that i can't repurchase this before i use up my other body moisturizers. 10/10. 

diptyque philosykos edt sample: gods bless the cardboard box that once held the greek fig leaves the founders were inspired by, bless the figs above their heads, bless the sap running down the bark, and bless the green and purple skin of every fruit that falls from the branches. i've been wearing philosykos for a while, and i got this sample from the sales associate when i went to buy the matching panoramic tray. this brings a tear to my eye every time i catch a sniff from my laundry pile, and that's only half an exaggeration. i chose my major because of this perfume. i'm convinced i was named after this perfume. 10/10. put a bottle in my coffin. in fact, build my coffin out of fig wood. 

diptyque l'eau papier edt sample: ever since maison margiela's whispers in the library got cut, i've been looking for something that gives the same vibe. this is close enough, but not quite the same, though i'm not complaining. it's lighter, airier, a little truer to the inspiration, and it's a treat when layered with philosykos. i might buy the full-size when i finish my current paper-ish perfumes. 9/10. 

lush breath of god solid perfume: this would be delightful on literally anyone other than myself, because i bought it when i was dating someone who i still see behind my eyelids in the moments before i fall asleep, and that is when i can bring myself to try to sleep at all. it smells like fruit and incense, and the name is fitting, because it does feel like a god's breathing down my neck and whispering to me everything that went wrong back then. i used up the last few dabs of breath of god by early april and i swore to myself i'd never smell it again. i cannot rate this. it does smell very good, though, especially if you're into more eccentric fragrances. just don't come near me when you're wearing it.

Your best friend kissed you that Friday before finals week.



You always knew she loved you, and you always felt the same, but she was tipsy, not in her right mind‚Ä¶ and it wasn‚Äôt the right moment. You didn‚Äôt want to take advantage of her, so you push her away.



She disappears on Finals Week, and you let her. Because she was doing that for her future.



Except another two weeks pass and she might as well be a figment of your imagination. You miss her, you love her, and it looks like she‚Äôs planning to disappear for good.  
  


Yeah, that‚Äôs not happening.



Listener POV: 



You remember it clearly: it was the Friday before Finals week, you and your friend group decided to have a wild night before burying yourself in books and studying for the final stretch. Your best friend drives you to your apartment and looks after you as usual. You‚Äôre tipsy, anxious about the exams, and he does such a good job of comforting you.¬†



Overwhelmed by all your emotions, and feeling like he‚Äôs your anchor, your constant in the world of stress and deadlines, you throw caution to the wind and kiss him like you always meant to.



Except he pushes you away.



It‚Äôs all a blur after that. You bury yourself in books, hide from everyone, study your ass off despite your heart breaking‚Ä¶ because you didn‚Äôt only get rejected, you also crossed a boundary, and he probably hates you now and you don‚Äôt want to face that. You feel like you need to apologise, to say let‚Äôs be friends again, but you just default to going away and hiding because it‚Äôs easier.



Easy, until he turns up at your door.

So‚Ä¶ finals, huh.



I did okay in thermodynamics, pretty sure I‚Äôll need to retake mechanical systems modelling‚Ä¶ how about you?



Well, you always hated C++. Take a different one next term. Didn‚Äôt you say python agreed with you more?



You‚Äôll do fine. You‚Äôre good at the whole IT concept. You live and breathe database and you aced your internship. It‚Äôs just the language you don‚Äôt agree with, and you don‚Äôt specifically need C++ for the line of work you want anyway, right?



Hey, so‚Ä¶



I‚Äôve been wanting to ask. How have you been?



That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ barely a word. What does hmm mean?



Nope. *No.* We‚Äôre not doing this, okay.



Doing what? Hiding. Ghosting. Ignoring. Running away.



Yes I know. I noticed. You‚Äôd notice if your favourite sweater was missing, you know?



You‚Äôve been avoiding me. I know Finals week happened, so I didn‚Äôt bother you for a week, thinking you‚Äôd come around. It‚Äôs been three weeks now.¬†



Look, I fully intended on giving you space in case you needed it. You probably still do. But three weeks?



You won‚Äôt read my texts. You won‚Äôt open your messaging apps. I don‚Äôt see you in the library, our friends are starting to think you‚Äôve just been a figment of our imaginations‚Ä¶



You were‚Ä¶ avoiding me because you think I‚Äôm mad. I wouldn‚Äôt be texting you if I was mad, would I?



I‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt mean to snap. No, don‚Äôt shut off. Please. I need you here.¬†



Talk to me.



We need to talk about it like proper adults. Let‚Äôs just rip the band-aid off. You kissed me.



And you were tipsy. I pushed you away, because you were not in your right mind, you were stressed, I mean, who bloody knows what you were even thinking?



/sigh/



Then you disappeared on me.



I understood. Really. I‚Äôm acting like a whole‚Ä¶ demanding asswipe now but I knew better than to bother you on Finals week. So I gave you that. But it‚Äôs been three weeks and I‚Äôm losing my damn mind.



I don‚Äôt know how you think this would work. I‚Äôve seen you ghost bad Tinder dates‚Ä¶ and some of your friends from high school‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt know why you thought you could ghost *me*. I‚Äôm your best friend.



Or at least‚Ä¶ I was.



Fuck, that stings.



You‚Äôre sorry? Well *no shit.*



WAIT. NO. Not for kissing me, you idiot. For fucking avoiding me. For pretending I didn‚Äôt exist. For fucking disappearing. You *should* be sorry.



What?



You felt rejected?



I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ fuck. I‚Äôm an idiot too. Of course you felt rejected. I literally pushed you off me‚Ä¶ but I was fully planning to talk to you the next day except I couldn‚Äôt find you.



I probably had ten missed calls on your phone just that day alone. Why wouldn‚Äôt you answer? Would answering and taking five seconds to say ‚Äúhello, dumbass, give me space goddamn it‚Äù hurt that much?



You didn‚Äôt just feel rejected, you feel you crossed a boundary too? And your solution was to‚Ä¶ what? THIS?



Ohoho, so you PLANNED to just let finals week pass. You weren‚Äôt planning *this* at all. OKAY. SURE. I‚Äôll humour you. And then what? After finals week, ***what***?



You planned to apologise for crossing a boundary and give me space. Okay.¬†



Except‚Ä¶ disappearing was easier because you were hurting‚Ä¶?



/frustrated sigh. Puts down cutlery on the plate./



Fuck‚Äôs sake.



I know you were hurting, but I wish you didn‚Äôt think you were the only one who did.



THAT‚ÄôS RIGHT. IT WASN‚ÄôT JUST YOU.



I didn‚Äôt push you away because of the reasons you think. You were tipsy. I had to bring you home because you couldn‚Äôt walk straight. You weren‚Äôt thinking straight. If I kissed you back‚Ä¶ well, I didn‚Äôt want you waking up the next day regretting it. I didn‚Äôt want you waking up the next morning regretting *me*.



I pushed you back not because I didn‚Äôt feel anything. I fucking felt everything.



I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôm in love with you, *you idiot*.



You didn‚Äôt cross a boundary. You crossed the bridge I was too chicken to cross. I had all these excuses lined up on why I didn‚Äôt act on it. We had time, we were okay, we had a good thing going‚Ä¶ but you kissed me and disappeared and I panicked.



I was losing you. I knew I was losing you and I didn‚Äôt want that.



I know you say it‚Äôs temporary but I‚Äôve seen you disappear on others. Your default was to run and move on with your life. You didn‚Äôt do goodbyes.



I saw it happening, alright? It felt like you‚Äôd already left and I was still in the same spot watching you turn the corner and leave.



Are you kidding me? It was a knife to the gut, realising I could lose you for good. I was *gutted*.



Oh don‚Äôt give me that. You were fully intending to disappear. I felt it here, my chest, my stomach, everywhere. I kept missing you. Looking for you. And I turned up here because I would be damned if I let you go without a fight.



Look‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre regretting it, if it didn‚Äôt mean anything, tell me. I‚Äôll take it. I‚Äôll go back to being your dumbass best friend. Just don‚Äôt disappear on me. I‚Äôll take anything you give me, just don‚Äôt go.



But if it meant something‚Ä¶



Maybe‚Ä¶ just maybe, don‚Äôt run. Not from me. Because it would kill me not to have you‚Äì

1kda19q,https://www.reddit.com/r/thebronzemovement/comments/1kda19q/the_canadian_apartheid_a_modern_tale_of_racial/,The Canadian Apartheid: A Modern Tale of Racial Division,"
Canada sells itself to the world as a beacon of multicultural harmony‚Äîan open society built on diversity, tolerance, and opportunity. But for many immigrants and second-generation Canadians, particularly those of Indian descent, this polished image masks a darker, unspoken reality: a silent, social apartheid rooted in stereotypes, exclusion, and systemic dismissal.

A New Wave, an Old Bias

The federal government‚Äôs recent immigration push brought in a massive influx of people, with Indians comprising the majority. This should have been a success story‚Äîskilled workers, students, and families seeking a better life contributing to a modern, multicultural Canada. Instead, it‚Äôs become a scapegoat.

From urban street corners to suburban coffee shops, a whisper campaign has turned public sentiment against these newcomers. Suddenly, every Indian is lumped together‚Äîno distinction made between long-time citizens and recent arrivals, between professionals and students, between families and so-called ‚Äúhouse gangs.‚Äù The result? A generation of second-gen Canadians, born and raised in the West, are now treated like strangers in their own country.

Stereotypes That Stick

The accusations are exhausting: ‚ÄúYou people cause all the accidents.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou live 20 to a house.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou smell bad.‚Äù These aren‚Äôt fringe statements‚Äîthey echo in schools, workplaces, and social media platforms like 6ixbuzzTV, where racial caricatures are often amplified in the name of ‚Äòhumor‚Äô or ‚Äòkeeping it real.‚Äô

The irony is cruel. Many of us‚Äîborn here, raised here, educated here‚Äîfind ourselves fighting the same tired tropes our parents faced decades ago. We‚Äôre expected to ‚Äúassimilate,‚Äù yet constantly reminded we don‚Äôt belong. This quiet form of segregation isn‚Äôt written into law, but it exists in eye rolls, exclusion, and the cold stares you get just for walking into a room.

The Price We Pay

This social apartheid doesn‚Äôt just hurt‚Äîit isolates. It warps relationships, poisons dating dynamics, and stalls friendships before they begin. People assume the worst before they know your name. It‚Äôs not just non-Indians either. Sometimes the divisions run within our own communities, where classism, colorism, and internalized prejudice play their part.

And let‚Äôs be clear‚Äîno one‚Äôs defending the bad actors. Yes, there are those who exploit the system, who make life harder for everyone else. But when 5% of any group messes up, why should the other 95% wear the blame?

A Call for Reality

We need to talk honestly about what‚Äôs happening. This isn‚Äôt just a brown issue‚Äîit‚Äôs a Canadian issue. When an entire community feels cornered, maligned, and disrespected, that says more about the national culture than the immigrants themselves.

Canada must decide whether it truly stands for the values it preaches‚Äîor whether its diversity ends at the surface. Because apartheid isn‚Äôt always about laws. Sometimes, it‚Äôs about how you‚Äôre treated when you show up, speak up, or simply exist.",1,1746215307.0,thebronzemovement,1,0.56,False

I am looking for advice on my situation right now

My partner(M 44) and I (F 38) had a big fall out a few days ago.
My partner is struggling with chronic fatigue so we are a single income household with me going out to work 5 days a week while he looks after home stuff etc and tries to make money on the side .. flipping if he has the energy to do so.

I have a morning routine where I like to make coffee and meditate in the morning for 20 mins.I don't like to talk or be bothered in the morning.All of a sudden he's been waking up early and it bugged me and we had a argument about it.He doesn't have to work so I can't see why he can't let me have time to myself in the morning..talking 6.30am to 7am just quiet time.

We talked it out and he said he will not bother me in the morning but he is entitled to get up whenever he wants and I agree that I am asking way too much .I propose to get up earlier so I can just have quiet time before work.

3 days later he is still sore about our argument even though I have been cooking dinner and taking out the garbage so he can get a nap in .He told me that it takes time for him to get over rows not like me who brushes it off right away.

We both watched a rom com last night and seem to be back to normal until afterward he grabbed me for a hug and proceeded to slap me on the backside saying that's what you get for hurting me this last few days.I told him stop but he said he needed to get all his anger out!.. I said stop your making me feel uncomfortable..I went to bed and he told me it's my fault and I pretty much deserve it. He is never physical by the way or ever hit me in the 8 years we have been together but I feel shattered from it and a little heartbroken at the lack of remorse from him.

I really don't know what to do or how to act now

This stretch is the first part of the journey if I were to ride over the black forest from my hometown of Freiburg (self proclaimed cycling city üí™üòé) to the Bodensee (Lake Constance) which is a dream and goal of mine.

 Knew the general direction, no gps, just going with the flow. Around 85 km there and back, ca. 800m altitude difference. Had some lovely stretches, some hellish climbs that are not! supposed to be done by bike, on Forestry roads made of mud and rocks that are so steep they are more like advanced hikes lol. Got lost but kept the direction, found grown over single trail hiking paths that I wouldn't want to ride with a fully, got off and pushed several times, there were passages where I had to stop every few minutes to catch my breath. Wouldn't recommend my worst enemy that route. Took me around 8 hours, but that includes coffee and smoke breaks (I know I know) and getting groceries for the family on the ride home.

The worst parts I didn't even photograph, there I was too focused on surviving lol.

On the way down, I took a really fucking gnarly road, steep and with up to fist sized sharp rocks, I thought my breaks would give up on me.Poured water on them as they started piping, it sizzled and smoked like hell. I never thought getting down could be more terrible than going up there lol. But I also got to descent on some very smooth bike paths where I could cruise at 50+ km/h unimpeded, which was *nice*

It was glorious. 10/10 Adventure.

That's xbiking for me. Just following my gut, exploring, being free and having a grand old time.

Using the Glyntrof B0C2QK5SD8 was an experience that combined both practicality and aesthetic appeal. This mason jar-style cold brew coffee maker is a unique addition to my kitchen, providing a charming retro vibe while being functionally innovative. When I first held it, the substantial 64-ounce glass jar felt quite solid‚Äîa comforting weight that hinted at its durability. Beyond its looks, the promise of leakproof and rustproof features immediately caught my attention, especially after spending years dealing with subpar coffee makers that dripped incessantly.  

**Durability and Design Stand Out**  
The thick soda lime glass construction feels like a step above anything I‚Äôve used before. Its ability to withstand daily use without signs of wear gives me confidence in the Glyntrof mason jar. I‚Äôve tested it for multiple beverages, and the wide-mouth design makes filling and cleaning remarkably easy. Add-ons like the stainless steel filter and ergonomic flip-top lid were not just practical but also made the whole process (from brewing to pouring) a drip-free affair‚Äîno puddles on the counter anymore! Its compact profile allows it to snuggle neatly into my fridge. That‚Äôs a relief since kitchen chaos is all too real in my home.  

[See Glyntrof B0C2QK5SD8 deals on Amazon now.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0c2qk5sd8/)  

**Performance That Impresses Daily**  
Trying out this coffee maker felt like a revelation. I experimented with coffee, fruit-infused drinks, and even herbal teas. Each time, the high-quality mesh filter did an admirable job keeping out coffee grounds, fruit pits, or tea leaves, which is a feature I absolutely love. One thing I noticed during my experiments: the airtight system truly delivers. Even when left overnight in the fridge, the flavors stay as fresh as when brewed initially. The pouring spout with the sealing ring is a thoughtful touch; I could shake the jar with confidence without worrying about making a mess. Also, the spout design prevents splashing or dripping‚Äîa detail that feels premium.  

**Perks of Owning This Compact Brewer**  
- Constructed from food-grade, BPA-free, lead-free, and cadmium-free materials for peace of mind.  
- Long-lasting and made for daily use, thanks to its durable soda lime glass build.  
- Features like the stainless steel filter and flip-top lid bring convenience often missing in competitors' designs.  

**A Few Areas for Improvement**  
- While durable, the 64-ounce heavy-duty glass jar could feel a tad cumbersome for weaker hands when fully loaded.  
- It's relatively easy to clean, but drying underneath the lid hinge can be a bit tricky.  
- Though compact, the jar‚Äôs taller height might not fit smaller fridges unless reshuffling happens.  

**Product Alternatives That Compete in the Market**  
After trying products similar to this, like the Takeya Cold Brew Coffee Maker and the Bodum Bean Cold Brew System, some comparisons become obvious. The Glyntrof stands out for its classic mason jar aesthetic and leakproof elements, which neither competitor fully replicates. However, Bodum‚Äôs glass feels marginally lighter, and its filtering system might edge out slightly in ease of use. In contrast, Takeya scores points with its insulated plastic design, which makes it highly portable but doesn‚Äôt match the classy look of Glyntrof‚Äôs glass jar. Between all three, Glyntrof offers superior versatility for multiple drink types, something not all brands manage to ace.  

**Price to Quality Ratio That Works Wonders**  
Considering its robust construction, useful add-ons like the filter and lid brush, and the wide range of beverages you can craft, this coffee maker reflects solid value. Compared to competitors, I‚Äôd gladly pay for something that brings durability and design together so seamlessly.

Okay‚Äîso, we were talking about accents. How he lived in Texas for 20 years but never picked up the Southern drawl. He mentioned wanting to hear my valley girl accent, and I told him I‚Äôd only do it if he gave me his best Southern accent first.

I wasn‚Äôt even serious. I was just teasing.

But surprise, surprise‚Äîhe dropped it into a voice note like he wasn‚Äôt about to awaken a part of me I‚Äôd buried under sarcasm, trauma, and iced coffee.

And it wasn‚Äôt just the words. It was¬†*how*¬†he said them. He‚Äôs got this soft-spoken yet commanding tone, and when he said,¬†*‚ÄúHow you doin‚Äô, babygirl,‚Äù*¬†it came with this lazy Southern cadence, just the right amount of teasing. Like a flirtier, softer Arthur Morgan stepped out of Red Dead Redemption and decided I was his favorite side quest. I could practically hear the spurs and smell the campfire smoke.

And what did my dumb little heart do? It latched onto that one line like it was a full-blown love confession. I rolled around my bed like a giddy fool, dying and resurrecting in the same breath. Cue my nervous laugh, the internal scream, and the very real danger of losing all dignity if he ever says it again.

And you know what? He did. Not through another voice note, but a text. I open my notification center and there it is:¬†*Luisito: ‚ÄúHow you doing, babygirl‚Äù*¬†‚Äî again. We hadn‚Äôt talked in a few days (I think he understands I tend to be quiet in between), and I really wasn‚Äôt expecting him to message me.

And the worst part? I can‚Äôt even be mad. I like that he remembered my Arthur Morgan comment. That he turned it into a stupid inside joke. That he‚Äôs playful enough to keep the bit going. That he makes me feel like someone¬†*worth teasing gently.*

It‚Äôs stupid. Stupid and adorable. And honestly‚Ä¶ kind of dangerous.

1kd9lz8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kd9lz8,Automation in Autonomica,"We‚Äôre so glad to have you around. Today, let‚Äôs dive into one of our favorite topics: automation.  
In the world of Autonomica,¬†**inspired by solarpunk aesthetics**, technology and nature thrive side by side. Here, machines don‚Äôt replace life, they support it. NPCs live freely, working for joy, not out of necessity. And just like them, you can embrace automation as much or as little as you'd like.

  
We designed our automation systems to fit naturally into your beautifully crafted farms and factories. Conveyor lines follow a clean, minimalistic style that blends well with your surroundings. To help with placement, we‚Äôve built in useful features like grid snapping, rotation angles, and smart alignment tools that make everything click together effortlessly.

# Natural Product Automation

  
In Autonomica, automation isn't just about gritty hardware components. You'll also produce and process natural resources. Create enclosures for animals that generate products, which you can then route through conveyor lines to specialized machines like Mixers, Smelters, Owens, and Cookers. For example, the Mixer can turn milk into cheese, which becomes part of more complex culinary recipes further down your production line.

Some Resource Examples:

# Meet Harvy

  
Harvesters (a.k.a. Harvy bots) roam your enclosures collecting freshly grown or extracted products and deliver them straight to the Sample Replicator. This machine takes a single item and mass-produces it, one copy at a time, until the original is completely used up.  
Once it receives a sample, the Replicator analyzes its structure at the molecular level (or at least pretends to) and begins fabricating duplicates using gooey science magic and a suspicious amount of energy. But here's the catch: the original gradually gets consumed in the process. If Harvy doesn‚Äôt keep a steady flow coming, production grinds to a halt.  
Keep your conveyor lines fed, or the whole system gets cranky. No sample means no output. Probably not FDA-approved, but very efficient.

# Caring for Your Crops and Creatures

  
You can assign Harvies to collect products from animals, like eggs, milk, or wool, or from your fruit and veggie crops. But remember, nothing in Autonomica runs on good vibes alone. If you want your animals and crops to keep producing, you‚Äôll need to give back.

  
Animals and plants have favorite food types and need specific care. You can water and feed them manually if you're feeling cozy or allergic to wires. Everything can be done by hand. But if you're more of the techy type, you can build out full automation systems with pipes and conveyor lines delivering your animals' favorite snacks and drinks right back to their enclosures. Happy animals mean better production.

  
  
Each animal also needs a comfy space to rest, and your crops require attentive care too. Some plants are seasonal and won‚Äôt grow during certain times of the year. To handle this, build greenhouses, controlled environments requiring consistent lighting, temperature regulation, and energy delivery.

# Powering Your World

  
Powering your farm and home takes real infrastructure. Here‚Äôs how energy production works in Autonomica:



# Windmills

  
These beautiful flowery techy thingies perform best at higher altitudes. Our wind system is fully simulated. Higher altitudes offer stronger winds, making mountain peaks and elevated terrains ideal locations. Nearby structures or terrain features can influence wind flow, impacting your windmills' efficiency. Strategic placement is both essential and rewarding.



# Solar Panels

  
Solar energy relies heavily on direct sunlight. Clouds drifting by or shadows from your buildings can noticeably reduce panel efficiency. But don‚Äôt worry, our solar panels are super snappy. You can quickly snap them onto your rooftops, and they'll magically adapt to the perfect angle of your structures. Satisfying and intuitive placement guaranteed.



# Batteries

  
Batteries store energy collected from windmills and solar panels. They smooth out your energy supply, ensuring stable power even when the weather isn't cooperating. No sun or wind? Less of a headache.

# Home Sweet (High-Tech) Home

  
Your home also consumes electricity. Appliances like fridges, TVs, and washing machines are fully functional. And yes, you‚Äôll actually need to wash your clothes regularly. Each clothing item has practical stats like ""practicality"" (how useful it is) and ""impression"" (how stylish it is), along with a hidden ""dirtiness"" meter that fills up with usage, which will affect NPCs' perception of you. We'll dive deeper into the clothing system in a future update.

  
Power and water are delivered wirelessly inside your home via the Home Pod (no fantasy or magic, just science). Connect a single water pipe and power line to the Home Pod, and it intelligently supplies all your home accessories.

  
The Home Pod also analyzes the furniture and utilities you've placed, actively providing tips about fulfilling specific room requirements. When set up properly, your home boosts your character‚Äôs stats. In Autonomica, your home isn‚Äôt just decoration. It‚Äôs an extension of who you are. We can talk about this later if you would like to learn more about it.

# Juicy Liquids and Chaotic Plumbing

  
Liquid production adds another fun layer to your automation empire. Craft juices, brew beers, (coffee for Kirara), or experiment with other mysterious liquidy things.  
Water pipes in Autonomica are fully modular and hilariously chaotic. Run them across floors, walls, rooftops, straight through your living room, or even under your bed if you're feeling wild. Yes, underground plumbing is supported, too. We've built a satisfying visual overlay that highlights buried pipe connections whenever you select the pipe tool. It‚Äôs clean, it‚Äôs efficient, and wonderfully messy in all the right ways.

# Delivery Drones and Product Fulfillment

  
Delivery drones manage product transportation effortlessly. Some NPCs will lend you their personal drones for special missions. For example, helping Ricardo bake his legendary croissants means producing 200 bags of flour. Simply place Ricardo‚Äôs Storage Drone near your production line and feed it the finished product.

  
Start by planting wheat, grind it into flour using a Mixer, package it, and direct it to Ricardo‚Äôs Storage Drone with a conveyor line. Once the order is filled, the drone zips off to Ricardo‚Äôs bakery. Knowing Ricardo, he‚Äôll return soon with praise and yet another quirky request.  
Expect your mega farms to be buzzing with delivery drones flying overhead, transporting your goods around and offering you that genuine solarpunk feeling.

# Mergers, Splitters, Lifts, and Other Jazz

We're going the extra mile to give you the tools you need to fully optimize your production lines. We‚Äôre inventing dynamic mergers and splitters that feel like magic. Simply run your conveyor lines into a merger or splitter, and it adapts automatically. You can connect multiple input routes and multiple output routes. The system intuitively recognizes your actions‚Äîconnect a conveyor line into it, and it creates an input; pull a line out from it, and it creates an output. This means you can build countless creative combinations effortlessly.

Elevators are equally dynamic. Stack them as high as you want, and each vertical segment can have multiple exits. Even cooler, you'll be able to specify precisely which resources exit at each level based on your own custom settings. This gives you powerful vertical control over your conveyor logistics. Pretty cool, right?

Another pretty cool feature is our¬†**Draggables**. Hold down the¬†**CTRL**¬†button to see glowing dots appear around you. These dots indicate objects you can adjust on the fly. You can easily resize things like rugs, frames, windows, and other decorative elements. You can even adjust conveyors after they've been placed, without needing to demolish and rebuild them if your plans for the area change.

You can also use conveyors as quick traveling rails. Simply approach a conveyor line and double-tap the¬†**space bar**¬†to hop on for a ride. Some of you might even use conveyors exclusively as speedy transport routes or build your own rollercoaster setups!",3,1746214216.0,Farmfolks,0,1.0,False

He Spider-Mans straight up the machine, slaps the glass like it owes him Flames Flex, then swan-dives a tiny paw through the retrieval slot. Ten seconds later - BAM - family-size bag of Flamin‚Äô Hot Cheetos clenched in his teeth like a neon trophy.

Cheeto dust everywhere. Wind picks up. Boom, orange fallout cloud across the Quad. Somewhere a finance major is coughing pure paprika.

Enter a dead-eyed grad student, coffee in one hand, existential dread in the other. He sighs, pinches bridge of nose:

‚ÄúUgh. Kevin escaped the bio-psych lab again.‚Äù

Apparently Kevin is part of a ‚Äúcognitive enrichment‚Äù study. Translation: grad students taught him how to solve vending machines for snacks. Genius. Beautiful. Terrifying.

Cognitive enrichment = they taught him vending-machine burglary for science. (Because why cure cancer when you can train a primate to commit petty theft?)

Security tries banana diplomacy. Kevin - still dual-wielding Cheetos - makes them wait while he licks every neon finger clean like a villain in a Tarantino film. Drops a single un-eaten Cheeto to assert dominance, hops into the carrier, exits like royalty.

Officer whispers to the crowd: ‚ÄúPlease refrain from encouraging experimental animals.‚Äù Meanwhile Kevin‚Äôs in the back of a golf cart, orange mouth, middle finger energy, plotting his next snack heist.

Moral of the story:

UIC is not boring.

My most recent lipid panel showed a total cholesterol of 244 and an LDL of 154 (6 points away from qualifying for statin therapy). I struggled with an eating disorder for most of my teenage years and early 20s, and the doctors always blamed my high cholesterol on that, stating that it would normalize when I was recovered. However, I've been in remission (woo!) for about 4 years now and my cholesterol continues to increase. We're now thinking it's genetic, but treatment is still basically lifestyle changes, or statin therapy when I qualify.

I'm not super excited about restricting my diet (for obvious reasons) but I'm honestly not sure how much ""healthier"" I can eat. I already prioritize high fiber foods like fruits and veggies, and naturally prefer white meat to red meat/pork. I also eat a lot of whole grains and legumes. I do love parmesan cheese on my pasta and 2% fat yogurt, and I take half-and-half in my morning coffee, but these aren't main food groups for me by any means. I also already exercise multiple times weekly, as I love to hike, walk outside, do pilates, and dance.

**Anyway, if anyone has a way to track saturated fat intake or make small changes that don't feel super restrictive, please let me know.** A girl's just trying NOT to go into cardiac arrest (from ED relapse or coronary artery disease LOL) in 10 years.  
  
EDIT: There seems to be some confusion about statin guidelines. I do not qualify for starting a statin per current guidelines for starting statin therapy in otherwise healthy patients aged 20-39. **The indication for statin therapy in patients under 40 years old is an LDL >190 OR an LDL >160 with a family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease**.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Unlocking Creamy Perfection with Ninja Creami's Versatile 7-in-1

If you're a fan of coffee and crave a creamy, delicious treat, making coffee ice cream at home is easier than you think‚Äîespecially with the Ninja Creami 7-in-1. This multifunctional appliance is a game changer for dessert lovers, allowing you to craft ice cream with a silky texture without the hassle of traditional methods. The magic lies in the innovative technology that transforms simple ingredients into luscious frozen delights, right in your kitchen.

### Key Ingredients for Smooth Coffee Ice Cream

When preparing a perfect coffee ice cream, the quality of your ingredients matters just as much as the technique. Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll need for a basic yet flavorful coffee ice cream base:

- **Strong brewed coffee:** Freshly made and cooled, preferably espresso or dark roast for maximum flavor intensity.
- **Whole milk and heavy cream:** These provide the rich, creamy mouthfeel characteristic of classic ice cream.
- **Sugar:** Granulated sugar or your preferred sweetener balances the bitterness of coffee.
- **Vanilla extract:** Adds depth and enhances the overall flavor.
- **A pinch of salt:** Elevates all the flavors.

You can also get creative by including coffee liqueur or finely ground coffee for extra coffee notes, but keep it simple to start for best results.

### Step-by-Step Preparation Using Ninja Creami 7-in-1

Follow these steps to craft perfect coffee ice cream using the Ninja Creami 7-in-1, relying on its creamy, smooth blend functionality:

‚Äã Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ‚Äã  
  
1. **Brew and chill your coffee:** Brew a strong cup of coffee and let it cool to room temperature, then refrigerate it so the mixture becomes fully cold.
2. **Mix your base:** In a bowl, combine the cooled coffee, whole milk, heavy cream, sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Whisk until the sugar dissolves completely.
3. **Pour mixture into the Ninja Creami pint container:** Make sure to fill it up to the max fill line to avoid overflow and facilitate even freezing.
4. **Freeze the mixture:** Place the pint container in your freezer for at least 24 hours. A well-frozen base is key for the Ninja Creami to work its magic effectively.
5. **Process the ice cream:** Insert the frozen pint into the Ninja Creami and select the ‚ÄúIce Cream‚Äù function. Let the machine churn and aerate the mixture, turning it into creamy coffee ice cream.
6. **Adjust texture if needed:** If your ice cream feels crumbly or icy, simply run the ‚ÄúRe-spin‚Äù function on the Ninja Creami to smooth it out. The re-spin option is a unique feature to perfect texture.

### Tips to Elevate Your Coffee Ice Cream Experience

The Ninja Creami 7-in-1 lets you experiment and upgrade your coffee ice cream. Here are some tips for a next-level treat:

- **Infuse flavors:** Add hints of cinnamon, nutmeg, or even a splash of caramel syrup into your base for added warmth and complexity.
- **Mix-ins:** When the ice cream is done churning, use the ‚ÄúMix-In‚Äù function on the Ninja Creami to fold in chocolate chips, crushed cookies, or chopped nuts for added texture.
- **Control sweetness:** Start with less sugar and adjust to your taste. The 7-in-1 lets you taste and tweak easily.
- **Use quality coffee:** Since coffee flavor is central, opt for freshly ground beans and strong brews for the best richness.
- **Experiment with milk alternatives:** You can use almond or oat milk for dairy-free options; just keep in mind the texture might vary slightly.

### Why Choose Ninja Creami 7-in-1 for Homemade Coffee Ice Cream?

The Ninja Creami 7-in-1 stands out because it offers multiple appliances in one, designed for versatility beyond just ice cream. Its unique ‚Äúcreamify‚Äù technology breaks down frozen bases, combining air and ingredients to deliver a texture rivaling artisanal ice creams. Unlike freezer-only methods, the Ninja Creami allows faster results and offers texture control with functions like re-spin and mix-ins. You get an ice cream that‚Äôs creamy, smooth, and truly customized every time.

Moreover, the device is user-friendly, even if you‚Äôre new to homemade ice cream. Its intuitive controls and compact design fit easily into your kitchen routine. With it, making that perfect coffee ice cream becomes a treat you look forward to‚Äîwhether as a weekend indulgence or a special coffee-flavored dessert for gatherings.

Tips and Tricks for Enhancing Your Coffee Ice Cream with the Ninja Creami Machine
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Mastering the Art of Coffee Ice Cream with Your Ninja Creami

Creating coffee ice cream at home with the Ninja Creami machine opens a world of culinary fun and customization. This versatile 7-in-1 machine allows you to whip up smooth, creamy coffee-flavored treats with ease. However, to truly enhance your coffee ice cream experience, certain tips and tricks can elevate the flavor, texture, and overall enjoyment of your dessert.

### Start with Quality Coffee for Deep Flavor

The foundation of any great coffee ice cream is the coffee itself. Using freshly brewed, high-quality coffee or espresso grounds will significantly improve the taste. Consider these points when choosing your coffee base:

- **Freshly Brewed Coffee:** Use medium to dark roast coffee brewed freshly before mixing. This ensures vibrant flavors that won‚Äôt taste stale or bitter.
- **Espresso Shots:** For an intense coffee flavor, add one or two shots of espresso instead of regular coffee. Espresso adds richness that cuts through the creaminess.
- **Cold Brew Concentrate:** Cold brew concentrate offers a smooth flavor without extra acidity, making the ice cream silky and bold at the same time.

Keep in mind that the coffee strength you prefer may vary. A good rule is to start with a moderate coffee level and adjust in future batches based on your taste preferences.

The Ninja Creami‚Äôs 7-in-1 capabilities allow you to craft ice creams, gelatos, sorbets, and more. To achieve the perfect coffee ice cream texture, leverage these tips:

- **Choose the Ice Cream Function:** This setting is designed to yield the creamy texture classic to ice cream, a perfect match for coffee flavors.
- **Pre-freeze Properly:** Freeze your coffee ice cream mixture in the Ninja Creami pint containers for at least 24 hours, ensuring the mixture is completely solidified before processing.
- **Use the ‚ÄúRe-spin‚Äù Feature:** If after the initial spin your ice cream is too icy or crumbly, use the re-spin function once or twice. This helps break down ice crystals and create a smoother consistency.

### Mix in Flavor Enhancers to Complement Coffee

Coffee pairs wonderfully with many additional flavors and ingredients that can boost your homemade ice cream‚Äôs appeal:

- **Vanilla Extract:** Adding a splash of vanilla extract to your coffee mixture rounds out the flavor and adds a warm sweetness.
- **Chocolate Chips or Shavings:** Stir in dark chocolate chips for a mocha-inspired twist that enhances every bite.
- **Pinch of Salt:** A small pinch of salt can balance the bitterness of coffee and enrich sweetness, making the flavors pop.
- **Cinnamon or Nutmeg:** Spice adds complexity. Try a hint of cinnamon or nutmeg to evoke cozy, comforting flavors.

### Adjust Sweetness and Creaminess to Suit Your Palate

Everyone‚Äôs taste buds differ when it comes to sweetness and richness, so adjust your recipe parameters with these nuances in mind:

- **Sugar Options:** Use granulated sugar, honey, or agave syrup, depending on your preference for sweetness and texture.
- **Dairy Choices:** Full-fat cream produces the creamiest ice cream, but you can balance with whole milk for a lighter option without sacrificing smoothness.
- **Non-Dairy Alternatives:** If you prefer a dairy-free version, coconut cream or almond milk work well but may slightly alter the texture and flavor.

### Experiment with Serving Ideas and Presentation

Your coffee ice cream doesn‚Äôt have to stop at the bowl. Enhance serving experiences to impress friends and family:

- **Ice Cream Sandwiches:** Use chocolate chip cookies or biscotti as the base for coffee ice cream sandwiches.
- **Layer in Parfaits:** Layer coffee ice cream with granola, caramel drizzle, and chopped nuts in clear glasses for visually stunning treats.

### Maintaining Your Ninja Creami to Keep It Performing Perfectly

To keep your 7-in-1 Ninja Creami working optimally and ensure the best results every time:

- **Clean Thoroughly After Each Use:** Remove any residue to prevent off-flavors and maintain hygienic conditions.
- **Store Pints Properly:** Store your ice cream pints flat in the freezer so the mixture freezes evenly.

1kd9j4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/GermanRoaches/comments/1kd9j4y/good_news_theyre_gone/,Good news! They're gone,"I've been managing a 20-room boarding house. 20 people with about one-third of them having major hoarding/uncleanliness issues. Hard to explain how bad the German cockroach infestation was. Nothing worked and I even brought them into my own house to the chagrine of my family.
After trying quite a few things I tried Maxforce gel bait and that was the beginning of the end of them. I started to see dead ones very soon after.
It's been a few months now and I can barely find one cockroach. When I do I put a few drops of bait nearby. This is about 6,000 square feet of living space. Compared to when I first started, where I couldn't leave my tool bag on the ground for more than 20 minutes without them crawling in and under it, and easily being able to count 20 of them at pretty much any time crawling around the kitchen sink or stove. Dropping the garbage bin would cause about 20 to drop out of the plastic lip.
I also got them out of my house where I found them in the coffee maker, huddling in the fridge, cabinets etc.
So there's hope! The gel baits are extremely effective!",3,1746214012.0,GermanRoaches,2,1.0,False

1kd9i45,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kd9i45,Automation in Autonomica,"We‚Äôre so glad to have you around. Today, let‚Äôs dive into one of our favorite topics: automation.  
In the world of Autonomica,¬†**inspired by solarpunk aesthetics**, technology and nature thrive side by side. Here, machines don‚Äôt replace life, they support it. NPCs live freely, working for joy, not out of necessity. And just like them, you can embrace automation as much or as little as you'd like.

  
We designed our automation systems to fit naturally into your beautifully crafted farms and factories. Conveyor lines follow a clean, minimalistic style that blends well with your surroundings. To help with placement, we‚Äôve built in useful features like grid snapping, rotation angles, and smart alignment tools that make everything click together effortlessly.

# Natural Product Automation

  
In Autonomica, automation isn't just about gritty hardware components. You'll also produce and process natural resources. Create enclosures for animals that generate products, which you can then route through conveyor lines to specialized machines like Mixers, Smelters, Owens, and Cookers. For example, the Mixer can turn milk into cheese, which becomes part of more complex culinary recipes further down your production line.

Some Resource Examples:

# Meet Harvy

  
Harvesters (a.k.a. Harvy bots) roam your enclosures collecting freshly grown or extracted products and deliver them straight to the Sample Replicator. This machine takes a single item and mass-produces it, one copy at a time, until the original is completely used up.  
Once it receives a sample, the Replicator analyzes its structure at the molecular level (or at least pretends to) and begins fabricating duplicates using gooey science magic and a suspicious amount of energy. But here's the catch: the original gradually gets consumed in the process. If Harvy doesn‚Äôt keep a steady flow coming, production grinds to a halt.  
Keep your conveyor lines fed, or the whole system gets cranky. No sample means no output. Probably not FDA-approved, but very efficient.

# Caring for Your Crops and Creatures

  
You can assign Harvies to collect products from animals, like eggs, milk, or wool, or from your fruit and veggie crops. But remember, nothing in Autonomica runs on good vibes alone. If you want your animals and crops to keep producing, you‚Äôll need to give back.

  
Animals and plants have favorite food types and need specific care. You can water and feed them manually if you're feeling cozy or allergic to wires. Everything can be done by hand. But if you're more of the techy type, you can build out full automation systems with pipes and conveyor lines delivering your animals' favorite snacks and drinks right back to their enclosures. Happy animals mean better production.

  
Each animal also needs a comfy space to rest, and your crops require attentive care too. Some plants are seasonal and won‚Äôt grow during certain times of the year. To handle this, build greenhouses, controlled environments requiring consistent lighting, temperature regulation, and energy delivery.

# Powering Your World

  
Powering your farm and home takes real infrastructure. Here‚Äôs how energy production works in Autonomica:

# Windmills

  
These beautiful flowery techy thingies perform best at higher altitudes. Our wind system is fully simulated. Higher altitudes offer stronger winds, making mountain peaks and elevated terrains ideal locations. Nearby structures or terrain features can influence wind flow, impacting your windmills' efficiency. Strategic placement is both essential and rewarding.



# Solar Panels

  
Solar energy relies heavily on direct sunlight. Clouds drifting by or shadows from your buildings can noticeably reduce panel efficiency. But don‚Äôt worry, our solar panels are super snappy. You can quickly snap them onto your rooftops, and they'll magically adapt to the perfect angle of your structures. Satisfying and intuitive placement guaranteed.



# Batteries

  
Batteries store energy collected from windmills and solar panels. They smooth out your energy supply, ensuring stable power even when the weather isn't cooperating. No sun or wind? Less of a headache.

# Home Sweet (High-Tech) Home

  
Your home also consumes electricity. Appliances like fridges, TVs, and washing machines are fully functional. And yes, you‚Äôll actually need to wash your clothes regularly. Each clothing item has practical stats like ""practicality"" (how useful it is) and ""impression"" (how stylish it is), along with a hidden ""dirtiness"" meter that fills up with usage, which will affect NPCs' perception of you. We'll dive deeper into the clothing system in a future update.

  
Power and water are delivered wirelessly inside your home via the Home Pod (no fantasy or magic, just science). Connect a single water pipe and power line to the Home Pod, and it intelligently supplies all your home accessories.

  
The Home Pod also analyzes the furniture and utilities you've placed, actively providing tips about fulfilling specific room requirements. When set up properly, your home boosts your character‚Äôs stats. In Autonomica, your home isn‚Äôt just decoration. It‚Äôs an extension of who you are. We can talk about this later if you would like to learn more about it.

# Juicy Liquids and Chaotic Plumbing

  
Liquid production adds another fun layer to your automation empire. Craft juices, brew beers, (coffee for Kirara), or experiment with other mysterious liquidy things.  
Water pipes in Autonomica are fully modular and hilariously chaotic. Run them across floors, walls, rooftops, straight through your living room, or even under your bed if you're feeling wild. Yes, underground plumbing is supported, too. We've built a satisfying visual overlay that highlights buried pipe connections whenever you select the pipe tool. It‚Äôs clean, it‚Äôs efficient, and wonderfully messy in all the right ways.

# Delivery Drones and Product Fulfillment

  
Delivery drones manage product transportation effortlessly. Some NPCs will lend you their personal drones for special missions. For example, helping Ricardo bake his legendary croissants means producing 200 bags of flour. Simply place Ricardo‚Äôs Storage Drone near your production line and feed it the finished product.

  
Start by planting wheat, grind it into flour using a Mixer, package it, and direct it to Ricardo‚Äôs Storage Drone with a conveyor line. Once the order is filled, the drone zips off to Ricardo‚Äôs bakery. Knowing Ricardo, he‚Äôll return soon with praise and yet another quirky request.  
Expect your mega farms to be buzzing with delivery drones flying overhead, transporting your goods around and offering you that genuine solarpunk feeling.

# Mergers, Splitters, Lifts, and Other Jazz

We're going the extra mile to give you the tools you need to fully optimize your production lines. We‚Äôre inventing dynamic mergers and splitters that feel like magic. Simply run your conveyor lines into a merger or splitter, and it adapts automatically. You can connect multiple input routes and multiple output routes. The system intuitively recognizes your actions‚Äîconnect a conveyor line into it, and it creates an input; pull a line out from it, and it creates an output. This means you can build countless creative combinations effortlessly.

Elevators are equally dynamic. Stack them as high as you want, and each vertical segment can have multiple exits. Even cooler, you'll be able to specify precisely which resources exit at each level based on your own custom settings. This gives you powerful vertical control over your conveyor logistics. Pretty cool, right?

Another pretty cool feature is our¬†**Draggables**. Hold down the¬†**CTRL**¬†button to see glowing dots appear around you. These dots indicate objects you can adjust on the fly. You can easily resize things like rugs, frames, windows, and other decorative elements. You can even adjust conveyors after they've been placed, without needing to demolish and rebuild them if your plans for the area change.

You can also use conveyors as quick traveling rails. Simply approach a conveyor line and double-tap the¬†**space bar**¬†to hop on for a ride. Some of you might even use conveyors exclusively as speedy transport routes or build your own rollercoaster setups!",4,1746213937.0,Autonomica,0,1.0,False

3. I buy really cheap sale toys/treats at PetCo to send cats and dogs home with. (Ask if it‚Äôs okay to give to pet beforehand).
4. I own a parrot and have him all over my profile, which attracts more bird opportunities.
5. I take pictures using portrait mode to send to owners. They look crazy professional but are super simple!
6. I do more boarding than anything and make sure photos reflect the cat set up in my home, the bird set up, as well as all the dog parks by my place.

I'm an Atheist. I don't actually believe this. However, this is just a fun little theory I came up with which might serve as a fun little thought experiment. 
Everything here is totally fallable conjecture lol, but I hope you read it anyway.

Ok, so I had an idea the other day while I was watching the Truman Show lmao. So basically I realized that Ed Harris's character, Christoph, was inflicting his own kind of pathetic ideal world onto Truman in order to vicariously live through him. It's a critique on artists, in a way, I think. Then, I considered that the Christian God could very well just be this. From everything we see in the Bible, we can come up with a few conditions for our pathetic God:
1. He created us in his image.
2. He loves is absolutely. (We'll get to this later.)
3. God is smart enough to make us and everything, but is otherwise a capricious and spiteful fool.

Well, this lines up with Christoph quite well, (sorry I'm going to be using the Truman show quite a lot here to make God's psyche make sense.). He creates Truman to be what he wants to be, and though he cannot literally create Truman in his image, he forces him to live in his image of a perfect world, even the woman that Truman loves is just Christoph's ideal woman, and the same goes with Truman's friends, his house, his job. Christoph, God, resents his role, his art, his omnipotence. He is a jealous god.
Furthermore, despite being jealous and living vicariously through Truman, he loves him like a child. 
The third point is only about God and doesn't parallel with Christoph strongly, however it doesn't clash whatsoever in my opinion, it just realizes exactly how flawed God is and therefore why this is at least a potentially interesting theory. 

However, you might be saying, then why does suffering exists of God loves me? This is the beauty of the pathetic God theory. When Truman tries to escape, Christoph makes forest fires, he makes nuclear meltdowns at nearby plants, he uses the ocean to drown Truman. Basically I'm suggesting that the reason we suffer is to keep us in the delusion. If we were infinitely happy all the time, we might reject God because we see that he is really just quite pathetic. He lives vicariously through us, and because we are made in his image we have free will, and because we have that he must use our suffering to limit us, as well as to test us. 
Everything in the Bible is a series of failed experiments. In the garden he gives Adam and Eve everything and they reject it because they want true free will, it could be argued this is the rejection of the bliss of the garden, or it is simply a childish rejection of god's pathetic wish for Adam and Eve to live as he wishes them to manifest for him. Either way, he fails, and he isn't happy. 
At the same time, Lucifer falls from heaven, another rejection of god's attempts to create an image. Another one is Noah and the flood. Rejection after rejection. 
The underlying idea is that the test I referred to is heaven and hell. Those who fail to manifest what God wants are relegated to suffering because God needs people to be god-fearing so that they can go to heaven. whether or not anyone has gotten to heaven in this scenario is a good question. I doubt it. He demands absolute stupidity in that you must follow along with what God commands and never really live outside of this ideal. 
In this case, earth is just ground coffee beans, transmigration is a coffee filter, and heaven is god's nice cup of coffee, to make a weird analogy.

Drank water, it comes back again in 5 mins, went outside to take a walk in the disguise of going to the washroom, again after coming and attending 5mins I start feeling sleepy. 

Its not that I haven't tried or anything sane is left out to try, its just that I am seriously irritated from myself because of this behaviour as sometime I have dozed of and have been shook back to senses by my friends or have missed some important points of lecture. Its not like ki mai 2-3 baje sota hu isliye ho raha hai, agar mai 10'o-clock ko bhi bed pe jake 6-7ish in morning uthu still I will feel sleepy like anything.

Hey!

I‚Äôve been meaning to do a digital detox and explore more around the city on weekends‚Äîcoffee spots, a picnic by the beach, nature walks,  run errands like go grocery shopping, urban sketching, journaling.....that kind of thing (Also I'm not a party person and have never been to a club).

Today, Lexcrity was buzzing with excitement. This small, struggling district had set up a ton of cameras. Andrew Leach, the leader here, was sending his granddaughter, Jessica, to the big city to film a show. To celebrate, they even organized a fireworks display.

Cameras caught the car pulling away, and it was time to relax. But as the director turned, he found a cameraman was still working.

""What are you filming now?"" the director asked.

The cameraman suggested, ""Let's get that kid. She's pretty cute. Why isn't she the one filming?""

""Oh, you mean Yasmine? She is definitely cute... but the locals say she's not the brightest and has a knack for stealing. Plus, she always lies and swears. No manners whatsoever,"" the director replied, shaking his head.

The cameraman stared at the girl in the frame, mumbling to himself. 'Not bright and steals? That doesn't sound right.'

In the small viewfinder, Yasmine Leach was jostled by the crowd. She clutched her large basket tightly, her fingers going white from the effort. If anyone got closer, they'd see the many scars on her hands, left over from blisters that had burst repeatedly.

Eventually, the crowd began to disperse, and Yasmine trudged off in another direction, her large basket balanced on her back.

The cameraman couldn't help but wonder where Jessica was headed and where her parents were, leaving her alone like this.

\*\*\*\*\*

Yasmine was off to forage for mushrooms, which could sell for three dollars per pound. Autumn had arrived early in Lexcrity, and after days of rain, mushrooms were popping up all over the place.

Even the rotten ones could be saved for soup later. As she walked along the muddy path, her mouth watered at the thought of her finds.

Meanwhile, the director spoke into the camera, ""Hey everyone, in about ten minutes, our other main character, Xavier Sanchez, will be arriving in Lexcrity.""

This new reality show, called ""Life Swap,"" was live-streamed, letting fans comment in real-time. Right now, viewers were already buzzing with excitement.

\[Wow, no wonder they say tough places produce tough people! That girl is adorable, but what a troublemaker.\]

\[Forget about her. Xavier's on his way!\]

Xavier was the heir to the wealthy Sanchez family and was quite handsome. But his personality? Not so great. So his mom signed him up for this show‚Äîto teach him a lesson about the harsh realities of life and hopefully set him straight.

At that moment, Xavier was sitting in a blue Bugatti worth ten million dollars. The crew member driving was nervously watching for any signs of his mood from the corner of his eyes.

Xavier had a scowl on his face and said nothing. There was a bone piercing in his brow, decorated with a single white diamond. It sparkled like his personality‚Äîsharp and dazzling.

The driver felt that looking at Xavier for too long would invite the sting of his sharp glare. So, he quickly looked away, momentarily distracted.

""Watch out. There's someone up ahead,"" Xavier warned.

The driver yanked the steering wheel, narrowly avoiding a pedestrian. Unfortunately, the person tumbled into the ditch beside the road.

""Are you blind?"" Xavier snapped, flinging the car door open and stepping out.

The driver broke into a cold sweat as he sighed in relief that there were no cameras around. If this made it online, he'd be totally roasted by the viewers.

At just seventeen, Xavier stood a towering six feet tall. He took long strides and reached the edge of the ditch in just a couple of steps, muttering without looking back, ""Are you all idiots? Someone help her.""

Only after venting his frustration did he squat down to check on the person in the ditch, and he froze‚Äîit was a little kid.

The kid lay on her back in the ditch, a basket awkwardly positioned beneath her, making her resemble a turtle flipped over, struggling helplessly. Her little arms and legs flailed aimlessly, and Xavier couldn't help but chuckle.

The crew members heard his laughter and grew tense. 'No wonder they call Xavier a troublemaker. Even after an accident, he still found it funny, completely unfazed.'

""Hey, you look like the turtle my mom has,"" Xavier joked, and to everyone's surprise, he planted a foot on the edge of the ditch and reached out, pulling the kid out.

With all the recent rain, the ditch was filled with water. The kid, Yasmine, soaked through and shivering, stood in front of Xavier, clutching her basket tightly.

""Mushrooms, my mushrooms..."" Yasmine murmured, her expression heartbroken. Those were the mushrooms she had just picked, now ruined‚Äîthree bucks down the drain, and no soup for dinner.

""What mushrooms?"" Xavier asked, stunned.

The crew finally approached, surrounding them. Seeing such a tiny kid, they got even more anxious and bombarded her with questions.

""How old are you?""

""Where's your family?""

""What's your name? Do you know your parent's phone number?""

""Are you hurt?""

Yasmine didn't answer. Instead, she leaned over the edge of the ditch, trying to reach for the mushrooms floating in the water.

Xavier looked down, only to see that she was dressed lightly, even though autumn had arrived. Her sandals had broken straps, looking like something scavenged from the street. Her pants were rolled up, revealing pale legs dotted with bug bites.

The scene hit Xavier hard‚Äîa wave of pity washed over him. He turned back to the crew, who were still bumbling around with questions, and frowned. ""What are you all doing? Help the kid. She needs to gather her mushrooms.""

The crew shot up awkwardly and mimicked Yasmine's stance, leaning over to pick up mushrooms from the ditch.

But Xavier wasn't satisfied. He gave the driver a quick kick in the backside, sending him into the ditch. ""You drive a nice car, so get down here and help.""

The driver turned beet red but didn't dare argue. He bent down to assist, mumbling under his breath.

After the mushrooms were collected, Yasmine seemed to snap out of her daze. She looked up at Xavier and said softly, ""Thank you, sir.""

Instantly, Xavier felt a jolt wash through him, like an electric shock. He grinned, ""I've done a lot of bad things, and this is the first time someone's thanked me.""

Yasmine lowered her head, thinking for a moment. Then she looked back up, her expression serious. ""What's a bad thing?""

""You're too young to know."" Xavier chuckled, and after a pause, he asked, ""What's your name?""

""Yasmine Leach.""

As they started chatting, the production team couldn't hold back any longer. ""Mr. Sanchez, we're already half an hour late. They're waiting for you over there.""

Xavier, ever the rebel, smiled. ""Oh, let them wait another half hour.""

The team was in a frenzy. ""But... even if you don't care about the show, what about this kid? She's soaking wet. If we don't send her home, she's going to catch a cold.""

Xavier shrugged off his jacket and wrapped it around Yasmine. ""Are you still cold?""

Yasmine shook her head, confused.

The crew could hardly believe their eyes. That jacket was a custom piece, and now, wrapped around that kid, it was covered in dirt. Would it even be salvageable?

""Let's get you home,"" Xavier said to Yasmine, his voice cold yet somehow reassuring.

\*\*\*\*\*

In the city of Jinxeria, Jessica stepped off the plane and walked toward the camera, looking perfectly at ease. The distant, dazzling lights seemed to welcome her new beginning.

Nobody knew she was a reincarnated soul. In her past life, Yasmine had participated in Life Swap, where she was adopted by a wealthy family, which catapulted her to success.

Jessica looked into the distance, her eyes sparkling with ambition. 'Yasmine, from now on, I will take over your life.'

# Chapter 2 A Slap In The Face

The show ""Life Swap"" sent wealthy kids to the impoverished area while letting the poor kids experience luxury living‚Äîaiming to give them a taste of each other's lives.

Jessica arrived at the Sanchez residence in a crew van. The mansion, sprawling over ten acres and standing three stories tall, was surrounded by mountains. It boasted stunning views of both a golf course and the ocean.

As soon as Jessica stepped out of the van, she felt overwhelmed by the sheer luxury of the place, and so did the viewers.

\[Holy cow, this mansion is so stunning!\]

\[Wow, this lucky girl must've hit the jackpot with this opportunity. I'm so jealous!\]

Just then, a middle-aged man in a black suit approached Jessica. ""Hello, Ms. Leach, I'm Francis. Mr. and Mrs. Sanchez are not home right now. Please, make yourself comfortable.""

\[Is this the butler? I can't believe I can see a real-life butler like in the movies!\]

\[This feels like a dream come true!\]

In contrast to the excited views, Jessica felt a bit let down. She had a plan to win the Sanchez couple over, but they weren't home.

Francis handed her a paper bag with the CHANEL logo. ""This is a welcome gift from Mr. and Mrs. Sanchez.""

Jessica paused for a moment, forcing herself to stay calm. ""Thank you. Please let Mr. and Mrs. Sanchez know I really appreciate it.""

\[Wow, Jessica is so composed! How is she not freaking out?\] The comments were full of admiration.

Francis seemed unfazed, figuring the poor kid might not recognize luxury brands. He led Jessica inside, and the sheer luxury of the house took the viewers' breath away instantly.

\[Jessica is going to live here? It's just like being a princess! I can't imagine how Xavier feels moving from this castle to a run-down place‚Äînow that's a real test of survival!\] the online audience chimed in.

Meanwhile, the camera switched to Xavier's perspective. The scene shook slightly before settling on a shabby shack. It looked barely standing, half-collapsed and propped up by wooden beams. In the pouring rain, it looked even more precarious.

\[This is a real survival situation...\]

\[Jessica's family is this struggling? That's so sad.\]

The focus shifted back to Xavier, who stared in disbelief. ""Seriously? This dump? This horrible place?""

\[Xavier really can't handle this,\] the comments concluded.

Suddenly, Xavier squatted down, bringing himself eye-level with Yasmine. A crew member held an umbrella overhead, shielding them from the rain.

""This is your home? You live in a place like this?"" Xavier frowned, his expression tight.

\[Who is Xavier talking to?\]

The camera panned down, revealing a small, shivering Yasmine, bundled up in a fancy coat. She nodded gently, her brows and eyes glistening with moisture, looking particularly stunning.

Viewers gasped.

\[What a cute kid! Who is she? How did Xavier end up here?\]

\[Isn't that Yasmine, the one who lies, has no manners, and steals?\]

\[Is she wearing Xavier's coat?\]

\[Oh no, Xavier, don't talk to her. She's just a con artist. Watch out, she might take your stuff!\]

""Do you want to come in for some water?"" Yasmine asked, looking up at Xavier. Her voice was soft and slow, carrying a soothing tone.

Xavier managed a tight smile. Honestly, he didn't even want to step into this rundown place, but when he met Yasmine's bright gaze, he couldn't bring himself to say it.

""Now that she's home now. Maybe we should head back?"" a crew member suggested.

Xavier's rebellious spirit flared up. He placed a hand on Yasmine's back, gently nudging her forward. ""Come on, let's go inside.""

Yasmine stepped in cautiously, while Xavier marched forward and crashed the threshold, making the already battered house look even worse.

Xavier froze on the spot, and after a long while, he sighed, ""Don't worry. I'll cover whatever I accidentally break.""

Just then, a furious voice erupted from inside the house. ""You little brat, you're finally home? Trying to freeze me to death out there?""

The voice was rough and carried a heavy accent. Xavier didn't quite catch what was being said.

Yasmine did, but she just sniffled lightly before stepping inside. She quickly gathered some wood to start a fire and fetched water from a large pot, boiling it while putting two potatoes on top to cook. Once the water was ready, they'd have something warm to eat and drink.

Xavier hurried in after her and asked, ""Who was that?""

""That's my grandpa,"" Yasmine replied.

'Her grandpa? Why does he sound so harsh?' Xavier frowned. Then his eyes landed on something. ""What's this?""

Yasmine took a moment to reply, ""Getting hot water.""

Xavier pointed at the shapeless mound of dirt. ""I mean, what is that thing?""

""That's the stove.""

'She calls that a stove?' Xavier was speechless.

He quickly glanced around. The house had mud walls, broken tiles, and a thatched roof. There was no light inside, only holes in the walls letting light in. No TV, no couch, no coffee table‚Äînothing.

Nearby, a piece of tarp hung down, and Xavier could vaguely see a figure lying behind it. He assumed that must be Yasmine's grandpa.

'This place is a disaster. It's downright pitiful!' Xavier stood there, dumbfounded.

Yasmine had boiled the water. She poured a steaming bowl of hot water into a simple mug and handed it to Xavier.

""Here you are,"" she said, holding the mug carefully. Her fingertips were red from the heat, while her wrist had a pale, cold hue‚Äîfrostbitten from the chill.

\[Wow, this kid really knows how to play her cards right. Is she trying to win over Xavier?\]

\[Don't drink that! It's dirty! This place is a mess!\]

While everyone online was reacting dramatically, Xavier just felt his eyelids twitch. He grabbed the mug and slammed it onto the stove, his voice icy. ""It's not time for water.""

\[Yes! Xavier didn't drink it!\]

\[Just a typical poor kid with no skills. Who would want anything touched by those dirty hands?\]

Just then, Xavier scooped Yasmine up and held her close. He turned to the crew members, looking serious. ""Where can she take a hot shower? She's freezing.""

Even so, she was still pouring him water. Xavier paused, muttering under his breath, ""I thought she'd have a nice bathtub at home. What kind of place is this? It's just a thatched hut! Even a hut would be better than this.""

After a half a year of doing PT and some improvement in mobility and pain, I still had clicking and occasional pain when moving my hand certain ways.

I later went to a sports surgery specialist and did an MRI and found out the cause for my pain.

My doctor recommended PRP as an option because my injury wasn‚Äôt a complete tear so surgery wasn‚Äôt completely necessary but having been a year there was no guarantee that it would heal on its own any time soon.

The procedure cost 750 and wasn‚Äôt covered by insurance. I had some extra HSA/FSA money available and decided to try it.

A couple of weeks before the procedure they told me to cut out inflammatory medicine and not to drink coffee or alcohol 24 hours before the procedure. They advised that I drink plenty of water and to stay hydrated.

The procedure itself worked in two parts. The first was a blood draw where they located a vain and drew 60 ml of blood. It went quickly as I was well hydrated. I waited about 30-40 min for it to be run through a centrifuge and the concentrated platelets to be extracted.

The second part occurred while my blood was being processed with the doctor injecting a numbing agent, waiting some time, followed by the platelet injection.

I was informed that I may encounter pain for the next 3-6 hrs and swelling for up to 72 hrs after.

Tylenol was recommended for pain relief along with a couple of tablets of Oxi to get me through the first few days.

Luckily for me neither was the case. I had some pain early on but it was manageable. It kind of felt like there was an itch and like it did when I first got the injury. The next day there was a little pain so I was able to get by without any medication.

I read online that they advised continuing to abstain from Coffee and Alcohol for another 48 hrs after the procedure and decided to continue that after the fact.

Post procedure I was advised to wear a wrist brace and to minimize weight lifting and repeated movements of the wrist. I was also advised to continue to avoid anti inflammatory medication for the next month.

A month after the procedure I was to visit a hand therapy specialist.

I asked if I could continue to practice Jiu Jitsu post procedure and was advised not to roll but that drilling would probably be okay while wearing a wrist brace.

The wrist brace I picked up is linked here:

1kd94zr,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1kd94zr/pathetic_god_theory/,Pathetic God theory,"To preface this:
I'm an Atheist. I don't actually believe this. However, this is just a fun little theory I came up with which might serve as a fun little thought experiment. 
Everything here is totally fallable conjecture lol, but I hope you read it anyway.

Ok, so I had an idea the other day while I was watching the Truman Show lmao. So basically I realized that Ed Harris's character, Christoph, was inflicting his own kind of pathetic ideal world onto Truman in order to vicariously live through him. It's a critique on artists, in a way, I think. Then, I considered that the Christian God could very well just be this. From everything we see in the Bible, we can come up with a few conditions for our pathetic God:
1. He created us in his image.
2. He loves is absolutely. (We'll get to this later.)
3. God is smart enough to make us and everything, but is otherwise a capricious and spiteful fool.

Well, this lines up with Christoph quite well, (sorry I'm going to be using the Truman show quite a lot here to make God's psyche make sense.). He creates Truman to be what he wants to be, and though he cannot literally create Truman in his image, he forces him to live in his image of a perfect world, even the woman that Truman loves is just Christoph's ideal woman, and the same goes with Truman's friends, his house, his job. Christoph, God, resents his role, his art, his omnipotence. He is a jealous god.
Furthermore, despite being jealous and living vicariously through Truman, he loves him like a child. 
The third point is only about God and doesn't parallel with Christoph strongly, however it doesn't clash whatsoever in my opinion, it just realizes exactly how flawed God is and therefore why this is at least a potentially interesting theory. 

However, you might be saying, then why does suffering exists of God loves me? This is the beauty of the pathetic God theory. When Truman tries to escape, Christoph makes forest fires, he makes nuclear meltdowns at nearby plants, he uses the ocean to drown Truman. Basically I'm suggesting that the reason we suffer is to keep us in the delusion. If we were infinitely happy all the time, we might reject God because we see that he is really just quite pathetic. He lives vicariously through us, and because we are made in his image we have free will, and because we have that he must use our suffering to limit us, as well as to test us. 
Everything in the Bible is a series of failed experiments. In the garden he gives Adam and Eve everything and they reject it because they want true free will, it could be argued this is the rejection of the bliss of the garden, or it is simply a childish rejection of god's pathetic wish for Adam and Eve to live as he wishes them to manifest for him. Either way, he fails, and he isn't happy. 
At the same time, Lucifer falls from heaven, another rejection of god's attempts to create an image. Another one is Noah and the flood. Rejection after rejection. 
The underlying idea is that the test I referred to is heaven and hell. Those who fail to manifest what God wants are relegated to suffering because God needs people to be god-fearing so that they can go to heaven. whether or not anyone has gotten to heaven in this scenario is a good question. I doubt it. He demands absolute stupidity in that you must follow along with what God commands and never really live outside of this ideal. 
In this case, earth is just ground coffee beans, transmigration is a coffee filter, and heaven is god's nice cup of coffee, to make a weird analogy. 

Please, tell me your thoughts on my crackpot thought experiment. d:",0,1746213008.0,atheism,2,0.33,False

1kd92hy,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kd92hy/why_choose_waterdrop_wdkj600_for_reverse_osmosis/,Why Choose Waterdrop WD-KJ600 for Reverse Osmosis System Review and Features?,"The Waterdrop WD-KJ600 Reverse Osmosis System instantly intrigued me with its combination of cutting-edge technology and practical features. As someone who pays close attention to the quality of water in my home, I had high hopes for this system. After putting it through its paces daily, both its advantages and a few areas of concern became apparent, providing a comprehensive perspective of what it offers.

**Versatile Temperature Control for Everyday Needs**

A standout feature of this reverse osmosis system is its ability to dispense both hot and cold water with ease. From brewing coffee at 203¬∞F to filling a glass of refreshing cold water, I loved how precise the temperature control was. Adjusting the temperature between 104¬∞F and 203¬∞F felt intuitive, and it‚Äôs truly a game-changer for households where cuisine and hydration demand diverse temperatures. Preparing oatmeal or soups became quicker, while I no longer needed to boil water for tea. However, I noticed that external factors, like the ambient temperature or the vessel's material, could sometimes slightly affect the final temperature.

**Tapped Into High-Quality Filtration Performance**

Filtration efficiency is, unsurprisingly, the main reason anyone purchases a reverse osmosis system. This one didn‚Äôt disappoint, featuring a five-stage filtration process. It effectively reduced TDS (total dissolved solids), fluoride, PFAS, and even microplastics from my water. I tried comparing water quality before and after installation using a TDS meter, and the drop was astonishing. With the additional assurance of being able to reduce heavy metals and harmful chemicals, it gave me peace of mind knowing my family drinks and cooks with clean, healthy water.

**Minimalist and Space-Saving Design**

Its tankless design left a lasting impression. The Waterdrop WD-KJ600 took up very little room under my sink compared to other filtration systems I've worked with. Measuring just 17.5"" x 6.7"" x 16.6"", the compact build ensured I still had space for cleaning supplies. The black, semi-matte finish of the casing subtly blended into the background, a thoughtful addition for modern kitchens.

**Positives**

- Efficient water flow rate of 600 GPD, allowing me to fill a glass or pot in seconds.  
- Low drain ratio (2:1 pure to drain), significantly conserving water.  
- Easy installation, with clear instructions and minimal requirement for professional assistance.  
- Safety features like a child lock and anti-scalding mechanism on the smart LED faucet.  

**Smart Features That Deliver What They Promise**

The faucet's LED display became an unexpected favorite for me. It displayed real-time TDS levels and reminded me about filter replacement timelines. The heating and dispensing functions worked flawlessly and safely, reducing the worry of accidental burns. My experience was further enhanced by the low-maintenance design‚Äîfilter replacements were straightforward and did not demand frequent servicing.

**More Room for Improvement**

While this system excels in multiple areas, there are some minor limitations I couldn‚Äôt ignore.  

- Hot water takes around 15 minutes to heat to the preset 203¬∞F from room temperature, testing my patience several times.  
- Occasional noise from the unit during heating cycles was noticeable, especially late at night when the house was otherwise silent.  
- Though its purification process is impressive, it lacks compatibility with refrigerators or ice makers, which may be a deal breaker for some.  

**Alternative Offerings**

The filtration market is brimming with competitive options. A comparable option is the iSpring RCC7AK 6-Stage Reverse Osmosis System. Although the iSpring boasts a slightly lower price, it lacks the tankless design and instant hot water functionality offered by the Waterdrop model. Another alternative, the APEC RO-90, has a higher gallon-per-day capacity but doesn‚Äôt offer precise water temperature controls or a smart faucet‚Äîfeatures that can be indispensable for certain households. If you value space-saving convenience and versatility in temperature usage, the WD-KJ600 stands out impressively.

**Affordable Quality**

In terms of cost efficiency, I genuinely believe this system positions itself well in the market. While not the cheapest option available, its blend of performance, style, and modern functionality justifies the investment. Considering the long-term savings from not buying bottled water, the environmental benefits, and the convenience of ready-to-drink filtered water at various temperatures, this model brings financial and practical advantages to the table.

What I‚Äôm talking about isn‚Äôt running out of oil. That‚Äôs never going to happen. The reality is that we have to use oil to get oil. Texas in the first round of discoveries when wells were under so much pressure that they shot oil into the sky for a month before they could cap the it it was something like 1000 to 1 return. Now that they have needed to explore the sea bottom to maintain the relentless pressure of increased demand it‚Äôs more like 1.5 to 1 after expending the energy to build the platforms and drilling a mile under the surface. 

Once the ratio gets to 1 to 1 it‚Äôs useless and that‚Äôs the reason why we won‚Äôt truly run out. Truth is that we wouldn‚Äôt be still able to maintain that now unless fracking wasn‚Äôt figured out. That‚Äôs the process of injecting mostly fresh water into those dead wells to make the second half of oil now attainable and bought us some more time. 

We have used half of the (attainable) supply in 100 years. The second half is going to be gone in less than 50. Here‚Äôs the thing. We are far removed from the last generation that knew how to survive in the winter without trucks bringing us food from 2000 miles away. 

Nobody talks about this because there‚Äôs no upside to telling the masses that we are living on borrowed time. Dont get it twisted that we have known about this for a long time 

2009 supply and demand clashed and oil peaked. That‚Äôs usually one time occurrence with a relentless permanent decreasing supply and demand remaining above the supply. We may have been able to get that peak to be a platform before the decrease but it‚Äôs absolutely clear we could not ever exceed 120 million barrels a day. Even if our cars ran on water we could not get that much water every day for demand. That much liquid is incomprehensible and we can‚Äôt understand its immensity. 

The true value of 1 litre of gasoline; if I can travel 10 kilometres on 1 litre of gas for 1.30$ then how much would you need to pay a person to push your car 10 km? That‚Äôs the value of the 1 litre. 

The amount of energy contained by volume is a gift that only happens every 250 million years and we are fuckin squandering it in 200 years. What is the excuse? So we can deliver an iced coffee or a pizza and uber to our ignorant population who are not thankful in the least. Even renewable needs oil to be installed maintained and replaced after their lifespan. 

Also the energy produced is not significant to our needs. It will only produce maybe 10-15 percent max power. Electricity is not an energy source. We must burn or expend something to make it. Nuclear is a good option but 20 years to build a nuclear power plant and we are not considering it yet. There‚Äôs no good option. 

Our only hope is to ride bicycles and live in close proximity and sharing our food. That‚Äôs not going to happen. It‚Äôs not. Even i drive a truck and am not innocent and can be distracted by the everyday obligations that are in our lives. What‚Äôs the way forward. How do I unlearn this unpleasant information. 

Not everyone wants to listen to this and that‚Äôs ok. When the titanic was taking on water some people were saying that it‚Äôs cold and the ships unsinkable and went back to bed. You can‚Äôt save them and the lifeboats are full. Don‚Äôt waste your time trying to get them to listen or convince them. Concentrate on the ones who are able to process this. 

Even though it‚Äôs hard. We humans can do things that are impossible if we know what they are. Denial is not the answer

If you‚Äôre between 18-45 and want to get out more, meet new people, and do something different, then Round Table could be exactly what you're looking for!

We‚Äôre a non-denominational, non-political social club for men (or those who identify as male) across over 60 countries who want to have fun, try new things, and give back to their communities. It‚Äôs all about making the most of life‚Äîwhether that means heading out on adventures, having a laugh down the pub, or getting involved in charity and community events.

So, what do we actually do?

Every Table (local group) is different, but we get up to all sorts, including:

üèéÔ∏è Go-karting, paintballing, axe-throwing, and escape rooms

üéØ Archery, shooting, golf, and other sports

üö§ Water sports like wakeboarding, sailing, and paddleboarding

üçª Brewery tours, whiskey tastings, airfryer masterchef!

üåç Trips abroad, adventure weekends, and festivals

üí™ Charity events, fundraising challenges, and community projects

But it‚Äôs not just about having fun‚ÄîRound Table also helps you grow as a person. You‚Äôll build confidence, develop leadership skills, and step outside your comfort zone in a supportive environment. Whether it‚Äôs organising events, public speaking, or taking on challenges you never thought you would, you‚Äôll walk away with skills for life.

Get involved internationally! üåé

Round Table isn‚Äôt just local‚Äîit‚Äôs a worldwide organisation. Members get the chance to travel to international meet-ups, festivals, and exchange programs with Tables across Europe and beyond. Whether it‚Äôs a beer festival in Belgium, a skiing trip in Austria, or a world meeting in South Africa, you‚Äôll have mates all over the world ready to welcome you.

What‚Äôs the catch?

No catch‚Äîjust a small membership fee (around the price of a coffee a week). Only payable when you decide you want to be a registered member, so you can see if it‚Äôs for you first.

Why 18-45?

Round Table is all about bringing together like-minded guys in the same stage of life. It means that as members move on at 45, there‚Äôs always space for the next generation of guys to join, take leadership roles, and shape the future of their Table.

But don‚Äôt worry‚Äîwhen you hit 45, you don‚Äôt have to say goodbye! Most members continue their journey in 41 Club (another club in the Round Table family), where they stay connected and keep enjoying great events.

We've got tables all over the country in Armagh, Enniskillen, Belfast, Mid Ulster and Causeway Coast as well as a number of tables down South!

Crispy on the outside, tender and slightly chewy on the inside, these low carb snickerdoodles are everything you love about a great keto cookie! The toasty coating of cinnamon & sweetener makes these keto snickerdoodle cookies simply perfect with a cup of coffee!  Cookies are my absolute favorite sweet treat.  Mostly because I like their portability, built in portion control (unless you eat all of them. . . not that I'd know from experience ?,) and the fact that you can eat multiple keto cookies of different kinds without committing to one large  a person who likes to try a bite of everything, low carb cookies are my dessert  year I put together a collection of 30 of my favorite low carb cookie recipes, and now I'm adding a few more to the blog for you to try - starting with these low carb snickerdoodles! Like all of my favorite low carb cookie recipes, these are pretty easy to make! A bonus because when I start thinking I could go for a cookie, I like to be eating said keto cookie within 30 minutes or less.  ???

To make these keto snickerdoodle cookies, all you need to do is mix up your ingredients, roll the cookies into balls and dip in the cinnamon and sweetener mixture, then flatten slightly and bake for 15 minutes.  Mission accomplished! ?Toasty, cinnamon-y, cookie perfection.  Believe it.  I tried freezing these low carb snickerdoodles to see how they would hold up and they were just as good if not better than before I'd frozen them. They keep perfectly at room temperature in a sealed container for up to four days (that's how long ours  inside texture of the cookies got a little chewier every day, while the outside stayed toasty and crisp - it was awesome! I implore you to make these keto snickerdoodle cookies ASAP, and then report back as to what you thought of them! I have a feeling that once you try them, you'll be making them over and over again like I have!

This is also a long one, so buckle up.

I‚Äôve been full-time for eight years. So far, my experience has been solid! My business survived COVID, I‚Äôm steadily booking each season, and other than a few timeline hiccups, I‚Äôve mostly avoided major drama.

Until last weekend.

Almost two years ago, I was hired to photograph a dream destination wedding in Puerto Rico. The couple asked me to bring my second photographer¬†*and*¬†my husband along, encouraging us to turn it into a mini vacation. My husband and I are avid travelers, so we didn‚Äôt need convincing. We booked flights, planned some low-key excursions around the wedding, and made sure to stay cautious before the big day.

Finally, after what felt like endless prep, we were packing our bags. I thought the biggest stressor would be hauling all that glass around.

I was so terribly wrong.

My husband and I landed in San Juan and made our way to a little bed and breakfast tucked in the El Yunque Rainforest. It was bliss. We hiked, swam under waterfalls, and took a thousand photos for ourselves. On the way out to the western part of the island, we visited a coffee farm, met up with my second photographer, and settled into a beach house.

The next day, we headed to the resort where the wedding was taking place. Checked into our rooms. Drank pi√±a coladas on the beach. We ate a big dinner and went to bed early.

On the morning of the wedding, I flew my drone at sunrise, shot a full roll of film, and slowly started documenting the day as the wedding party got ready. Everything was peaceful.

My husband isn't one to lounge on a beach at a resort. So, he decided to go for a short hike while my second photographer and I got to work.

The day was going beautifully. The clouds were a bit threatening, but the rain held off. Family formals were smooth. The wedding party killed their portraits. And just as the ceremony began, the sun came out in the most cinematic way.

Then, as soon as the ceremony wrapped up, my phone wouldn‚Äôt stop buzzing. I glanced at the messages. It was my husband.

**He had been lost deep in the jungle for six hours.**¬†It was supposed to be a short hike, so he had no food and minimal water. He used a weak and intermittent satellite connection to text me and attempt to reach emergency services, but the jungle was dense and overgrown. The connection was unstable, and each message cut off abruptly. He needed me to contact 911 and get someone to help find him.

My heart stopped. I had to make an impossible choice: do I abandon the job or stay and keep shooting?

My second photographer (who‚Äôs also a close friend of ours) jumped into action and took over while I called emergency services. She also helped me communicate with the responders while I powered through sunset portraits.

I watched the daylight fade, not knowing where or how he was. It had been over an hour since I had last heard from him.

Panic was quickly setting in, but I had to keep going.

As the sun set and night crept in, I still hadn‚Äôt heard anything. I knew search teams and helicopters were actively looking for him. But short of entering the jungle myself, there was nothing else I could do. I had to keep my poker face on as the night progressed.

I kept shooting through the grand entrance and first dances, choking back tears. During the speeches, the maid of honor said the couple ‚Äúalways finds their way back to each other.‚Äù I nearly lost it.

Two hours later, he crawled out of the jungle.

Dehydrated. Covered in dirt. Badly hurt, and badly shaken.

I cleaned him up, fed him my vendor meal, and tucked him into bed. My second shooter covered the dance floor while I made sure he was stable. Then I went back and finished out the after-party.

You‚Äôre probably wondering about the photos.

Despite it all, they‚Äôre incredible.

Somehow, I compartmentalized. Somehow, my photographer brain took control.

Now that we‚Äôre home and the couple is swooning over their sneak peeks, I wanted to share this story because there‚Äôs a bigger takeaway here.

Being a wedding photographer sounds glamorous. We travel, we celebrate, we document joy. But it‚Äôs also an intense responsibility.¬†**You are**¬†***the person***¬†**expected to keep calm and deliver, no matter what.**¬†You don‚Äôt get to break down. You don‚Äôt get to disappear.

1kd8sdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1kd8sdt/i_bought_12_sugar_milk_samples/,I bought 12 sugar milk samples.,"I bought 12 sugar milk samples and heres what my very sensitive and picky nose thinks.

I seem to have a weird like of fragrances because everytime people are so in love with smells on here, i usually hate it, i isually hate every smell. Because when somethings called ""caramel latte"" i want that shii to smell like a caramel latte. I want to smell real CARAMEL, i want to smell like a damn edible caramel latte, someone walks by me and thinks i have a freakin caramel latte in my hand.
I hate that imagination shit, ""smells like a fresh warm latte you just ordered from the barista with oatmilk and whipped cream"" girl that smells like musk, alcohol and something synthetically sweet. 
And thats no shade to any company or anything because i understand this is all subjective and just because i dont enjoy a smell does not mean i hate on the product at all, i just dont want to wear it. Ive learned through this scent journey that i dont like typical perfumes and im looking for just 'scents', clearly thats a me problem haha. And i thought sugar milk would be more 'scents' of things rather than a musky, perfumey, typical scented perfume. But its more like childish and synthetic smelling and still misses the smells of the labels. BUT THATS JUST TO ME. 

With that, heres what i think of what i got. 

What i did was open them upside down so i didnt see the label, and smelled it without the name so my brain couldnt trick me into smelling what it was called. 

Sardines- head and shoulders, but head and shoulders smells better, sad about this because i really want to find a nice ocean scent

Cotton candy - strawberry, super SUPER sweet strawberry. The dry down is hard to smell, smells like a blue raspberry sucker, not strong.

Cloud milk- strawberry medicene mixed with the christmas aisle in JCPenny or any other departnent store.

Vanilla caramel syrup- the outlet mall at foxwoods in connecticut. I dont know what the hell this actually smells like, but it makes me think of that place.

Marshmallow cappucino milk- a coffee shop, but one that uses ALOT of sweetners

Sugar cookie- very sweet vanilla lotion, like a vanilla cashmere by eos concentrate

Little piece of cake- vanilla scented baby wipe

Bento box- those weird cans of squishy strawberry beads you put in your car under your seat for an air freshner

Choc milk - cheap christmas chocolate chapstick, literally made my stomach upset

Strawberry matcha- strawberry airhead concentrate, no matcha, very upset as i had high hopes for this one.

Brown sugar boba- coffee shop, after looking at the label, i could smell where the brown sugar is, but not without the knowledge of it.

Gooey vanilla custard- every other dept store perfume, wasnt able to name a single smell, just ""oh, yep, thats perfume"". Its sweet, but, add an unrecognisable sweet smell to a dept store perfume.

I wont be wearing most of these. Gonna force my self to play with cotton candy, sugar cookie, boba and vanilla caramel syrup. But i think long term ill only tolerate the cotton candy one. 

Any of you that are like me, drop your likes in the comments, I would love to smell like ACTUAL scents. This is so frustratingü´†

If your post looks fine to *you* but nobody reacts, comments, or even breathes in its direction ‚Äî congrats, you're probably shadowbanned. Reddit does this automatically. You don‚Äôt get a notification. You don‚Äôt get a warning. You just quietly vanish, like your motivation on a Monday.

She found [MediterraneanPlan .com](https://theworldhealth.org/mediterranean-plan-official) at 2 a.m.‚Äîwhich is also when she makes most of her life decisions. But this one stuck.

She followed the **Mediterranean weight loss challenge** part of the plan closely. Her grocery trips were less chaotic thanks to the **printable Mediterranean diet plan shopping list**, and her meals were more colorful than her Instagram feed.

She did mention that the PDFs were scattered. Her solution? She made a Google Drive folder and named it ‚ÄúOperation: Salad.‚Äù

What she appreciated most was the **flavor-packed Mediterranean recipes**. They were easy enough for a rushed weekday, yet delicious enough to feel like self-care.

She didn‚Äôt treat it like a strict diet‚Äîmore like a guide that finally respected her time and taste buds.

1kd8jzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1kd8jzz/the_past_really_didnt_just_feel_better/,‚ÄúThe Past Really Didn‚Äôt Just Feel Better‚Äù,"Eli wasn‚Äôt a nostalgic guy. Born in 2001, the '90s meant nothing to him. He just thought it was grunge, old computers, and OJ Simpson. So when he was offered a a time travel experiment to 1994 he said yes mostly out of boredom. He didn't pack anything special. Wore his usual hoodie, sneakers, and brought his phone, which was useless to where he landed. 

The first thing he noticed in 1994 was the silence. Not eerie silence...just the absence of constant buzzing, pings, and notifications. The world sounded real. Birds. Distant music. A car rumbling past. And people... just talking. To each other. He stumbled into a diner. The waitress called him ""hon"" and refilled his coffee without being asked. The coffee cost 85 cents. He stared at the coin change in his palm like it was ancient treasure. Eli wandered through a record store, expecting to be bored, but the guy behind the counter struck up a conversation. Not to pitch anything just to talk. About music, life, whatever. Nobody was trying to brand themselves. Nobody was selling a course. People were just... being themselves. 

He noticed how relaxed everyone seemed. Strangers made eye contact. Teenagers weren‚Äôt filled with anxiety. People weren‚Äôt obsessed with cameras or ‚Äúcontent.‚Äù Even the air felt different. Unfiltered. Less poisoned. 

For a week, Eli lived like someone from the past. He didn‚Äôt tell anyone he was from the future because who would believe him? He just went from bookstores to sidewalks to bus rides, absorbing a world where everything wasn‚Äôt so fast, so commodified, so lonely. People had fewer things, but somehow had more. More time. More conversation. More space to breathe. When the recall signal buzzed in his pocket‚Äîa single device implanted in his coat‚Äîhe hesitated. But he returned. 

2025 smacked him in the face the moment he got back. Ad walls, subscription fees, aggressive eye contact avoidance, and headlines that felt like satire.

He sat down with the techs who ran the experiment. They looked at him eagerly.

‚ÄúWell? Was it all overhyped?‚Äù one of them asked, smirking. ‚ÄúWas it worse than people say it was?‚Äù

Eli leaned back in the cold, over-lit lab.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt overhyped. Life didn't just feel it was better. It was better.‚Äù

They laughed nervously.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPeople were kinder. Things were cheaper. Life wasn‚Äôt optimized to kill your soul slowly.‚Äù

A silence hung.

‚ÄúBut like, there was no Wi-Fi,‚Äù one of the interns said. ‚ÄúNo streaming. No TikTok.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes...and it was beautiful.,‚Äù Eli replied.

He never talked about the trip again. Just moved to a small town, got an old phone, and started walking more. People called him a Luddite. He didn‚Äôt care.

Because now he knew.

The past wasn‚Äôt perfect but it was *better*.

And the worst part?

We knew how to live better.

We just forgot.

1kd8jmk,https://i.redd.it/682df7eczeye1.jpeg,Mitchum read Rory all wrong.,"Mitchum told Rory that she didn't have what it took to go out there and get a story. That she didn't have 'it'. But we saw Rory chase down the life and death brigade for a story, and later on we see her borderline harass the editor of the Stanford Eagle Gazette for a job. She definitely had the drive. 

However, I agree that she did not present that drive to Mitchum.

And why? Because she was trying to impress him! She was doing everything to make him like her as a person. She learned about his coffee preferences, and his life at Yale. She thought he already saw her potential as a journalist and that was why he'd chosen to give her the opportunity of a lifetime. She didn't know she was proving herself as a journalist. She just wanted in with one of the industry's biggest names and of course, she wanted Mitchum to like her after his family dragged her through the dirt.

He never got a clear image of who she was because she wasn't presenting herself as a journalist. If Mitchum was actually able to read people as well as he thought he could, he might have picked up on the fact that she was shadowing him as an assistant because she wanted his approval. If he'd made it clear that he wanted to see what she was made of as a journalist, I have no doubt that she would have put herself out there.

Mitchum also pointed out that she didn't say anything in the meeting they had and Rory said she wasn't sure if she should. Again, that was her not wanting to step out of line with Mitchum. She crashed a class at Harvard University as a sixteen year old and joined the argument. She wasn't one to shy away from debate or back off. She only did so around Mitchum.",84,1746211507.0,GilmoreGirls,30,0.83,False

1kd8ifh,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kd8ifh/why_choose_the_frigidaire_efic103_ice_maker_a/,Why choose the Frigidaire EFIC103 ice maker? A detailed review awaits!,"Testing out the Frigidaire EFIC103-AMZ-SC Counter Top Ice Maker is an icy adventure I never thought I needed. This genius machine has turned an everyday kitchen corner into a buzzing ice station for family gatherings, weekend parties, and even those random midnight refreshing beverages. The Frigidaire EFIC103-AMZ-SC isn‚Äôt just an ice maker; it's practically a new member of my household with its impressive features and quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**

At first glance, the stainless-steel exterior of this ice maker is sleek and modern, fitting perfectly into my kitchen setup. The compact dimensions, 14 x 12 x 15 inches, make it countertop-friendly while still providing enough capacity to churn out significant amounts of ice. Though it's slightly bulky compared to some competitors, the portability makes up for it. Lugging it to my patio for summer BBQs was surprisingly manageable. The transparent window? A cherry on top! Watching the ice cubes form is oddly satisfying, like watching raindrops race down a glass window on a lazy day. 

**Performance and Ice Production**

The magic begins in under six minutes, which is quite impressive for something this compact. The first batch of ice lands in the oversized bucket, accommodating up to 2.2 pounds of cubes at a go. I tested its claim of producing 26 pounds of ice per day, and while I didn't host a 24-hour ice party, it delivered more than enough cubes for me and the neighborhood lemonade stand.

[Check Frigidaire EFIC103-AMZ-SC price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b004vv8goq/)

Another highlight is the option to select between two cube sizes. I found the smaller cubes perfect for my iced coffee, while the larger ones worked great for keeping drinks cold at my recent dinner party. The cubes come out clear and solid, not the cloudy, quickly-melting kind.

**Ease of Use**

I‚Äôm not particularly tech-savvy, yet this ice maker made me feel like an appliance pro. The electronic control panel is straightforward, with LED indicators showing when water is low or when the bin is full. This feature saved me from unnecessary guesswork. Filling the reservoir under the ice basket is equally hassle-free, though you‚Äôll need a steady hand to avoid a minor water spill now and then.

**Automatic Self-Cleaning**

This function is an overlooked hero. The self-cleaning mode made maintenance almost second nature. After a busy weekend of non-stop ice production, I simply held the ON/OFF button for over five seconds, and voil√†, the machine did its thing for the next 30 minutes. Trust me, this cleaning program takes away so much hassle and ensures you're always serving fresh, clean ice.

**Key Benefits**

- Rapid ice production, ready in just under 6 minutes.
- Large capacity with up to 26 lbs of ice per day.
- Compact and modern stainless-steel design with a transparent lid.
- Choice of two cube sizes for versatile use.
- Self-cleaning program for convenient maintenance.

**Shortcomings**

- Slightly bulky compared to some ultra-compact alternatives.
- The reservoir needs frequent refilling for bigger groups.
- Occasionally, cubes may stick together if left in the bucket too long.

**Alternative Offerings**

Peer products like the Igloo Portable Ice Maker or the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker present some tough competition. The Igloo, for instance, boasts similar production capacity but doesn‚Äôt quite match the build quality of the Frigidaire EFIC103. Meanwhile, the GE Profile Opal produces chewable nugget ice, which is a niche option many prefer, but has an equally higher price tag and a more complex interface.

Compared to these alternatives, the Frigidaire is perfect for those looking for a no-nonsense machine with a balance between build quality, efficiency, and affordability. It avoids the high-end pricing yet competes where it matters most‚Äîperformance.

**Price Performance**

Evaluating the price against its features, this countertop ice maker delivers remarkable value. When I compare it to pricier models, I find it ticks all essential boxes without straining the budget. Sure, there are certain limitations, like needing regular water refills, but these are minor nitpicks for something that works this effortlessly. If getting clear ice cubes without the wait and complexity of installing a bulky freezer ice maker is your goal, this product justifies its cost.

I want to fix this but I don't know how?,"For the purposes of this post I'll refer to my ex as ""A"" , my girlfriend before her as ""B"" and our common gay friend as ""C"", they are also important to the story.

Long post ahead, there's many important details in the post so I'd appreciate it if you would read the whole thing but there's a TL;DR at the bottom.

#Context

I met A in the first year of university. Now we're in our second year. We're in film school, both of us in the film directing department, meaning we had to work togheter on a lot of our early assignments and exams. We became friends quickly and had chemestry. To be honest, I was really into her from the very moment I saw her, but the time I was in a 1 year long relationship with B and I'm not the type to cheat (also I was convinced A was 100% lesbian, she's bi).

A few months before the beginning of our second year of university I broke up with B. The relationship ended up being very unhealthy so we broke it off. I blocked her on everything.

A month and a half after the breakup C revealed to me that A really liked me, a week of talking and flirting later me and A ended up in a relationship. It's a little awkward to admit but C kind of acted like Cupid in this whole situation, if it wasn't for him I wouldn't even have considered A liking me since she was really bad at giving signs.

Right now C continues to be my wingman in this situation, since he used to be much closer to A than me for a while, but now he's closer to me because A hangs out with prople he dosn't like.

Me and A were togheter for 5 months and broke up a little over a month ago. I still love her a lot and she's the only thing I can think about.

#My depression and A's insecurities 

My depression and A's insecurities (which I found out about only yesterday, through a late night chat with C) were the primary issues that casued the breakup.

About 3 months into our relationship I started having depressive episodes again. I was having troubles going to university and working on uni work. When I told A about this she told me that I can ""be depressed after exam season ends"" and doubled down on that statement when I brought up that I didn't like what she said. 

My depression continued until recently, after the breakup, when I started getting better, but I never felt like I could talk to A about it, since she had a cold and dismissive attitude towards it.

I messed up *badly* when I couldn't help A with a common exam we had and ended up skipping that exam entirely.

Something that A really didn't like was that, throughout our relationship, I still had B's things in some boxes in my apartment. The reason I had them was purely logistical. I was still figuring out how to give her the things back, as B lives 12 hours away by car and I didn't want to unblock her to figure out how to give them back. I had no feelings left for B.

Yesterday, through that chat with C, I learned that A became extremely insecure and frustrated in a lot of ways. She thought I still had feelings for B (never knew about this) and was comparing herself to B lot. They are quite different in their style. A is more of a hippie chill girl while B was elegant and posh. I never found this to be an issue though and loved the hell out of A's quirks and style.

I also learned that A had the impression she was a rebound and that I stayed in the relationship with her just to not upset her. This was never the case.

#Before the breakup

Right before the breakup I had reached what I could call the peak of my depression. On a wednesday I stayed up all night since I couldn't sleep. On thursday I went to bed at 8 A.M. and woke up at 7 P.M. to 10 missed calls from A, she was extremely worried and pissed off. We decided to meed on friday. 

Friday I decided to do some university work I was heavily behind on so I called off our meeting and decided to meet on saturday. Another major mistake I had made. 

Saturday comes and A arrives at my place with a backpack of my stuff, that's when she broke up with me.

When we broke up I felt defeated. She said she wants us to stay friends as to not make things awkward in class and I genuinely thought she wanted that.

#After the breakup

After the breakup I tried my best to act like a friend to A and keep things casual. 

Yesterday I found out from C that A found that weird and expected me to fight more for her and our relationship.

Eventually A told me that talking to me hurts her so I stopped engaging with her entirely. I still felt her when she'd stare at me from a distance and could easily read her behaviour and body language (she didn't like what was happening) but I figured that that was just her proccessing the whole situation.

We saw eachother almost daily at university since our main film directing class lasts as long as 6 hours but I kept interaction to saying ""hello"" and ""goodbye"".

At one point she started hanging out with some girls she used to hate in the past, one of which used to have a crush on me. C knows A on a deeper level than me and says she's easily influenced like a child. He says the way she's acting now definitely has something to do with her new ""support group"", the girls she hangs out with, especially the one that used to like me.

#Two days ago

Two days ago I finally made up the courage to talk to A. I kept my expectations to a minimum and tried to be casual and friendly.

We skipped our last class of the day to go to a coffee shop we used to visit in the past. We spoke about how we've been doing and the whole thing ended up with her hugging me and initiating a kiss after which we we made out some more.

At one point she also confessed going to an orgy or something like that to try and forget about me.

That night we spoke on the phone and she told me she's actually not ready for us to get back togheter. She said that our relationship came after a a period of healing of hers and that, after the breakup, something in her broke and she dosn't feel like she can ""keep up with the rythm of a commited relationship anymore"".

It's clear that she dosn't really know how to handle the situation or what she wants either. I try to call and text her but she's very dry in texting.

#I want to fix this

I really want to fix this but don't know how to proceed. I love A and can't get her out of my head. Before meeting up with C yesterday I had a panic attack because all I could do was think of A and our breakup.

TL;DR: My ex's coldness and indifference lead to me not being able to open up to her about my depression and distancing myself. Because of this she started building up frustrations that she never told me about. She broke up with me 1 month ago after a 5 month long relationship. Our common friend has revealed a lot of things to me that she never told me about. I finally found the courage to talk to her 2 days ago after which she kissed mr which makes me want to fix things, but I'm not sure that's what she wants anymore because she said she's not ready to get back togheter.",2,1746211324.0,relationship_advice,8,1.0,False

1kd8e55,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1kd8e55/living_with_an_asshole/,Living with an asshole.,"This post is about one of the many fights I‚Äôve had with my narcissistic father. I‚Äôm 17 years old, born female. A few months ago, we had the biggest fight yet. It was February 2025. My grandma had passed away unexpectedly in September 2024, so it was already a very difficult time for me. I had also just started switching antidepressants and was in the middle of a bad depressive episode. I was feeling extremely suicidal.

I had just gotten home from school. Literally, as I opened the front door, my dad told me to look after our dogs. I responded that I would in 30 minutes because I still had my house keys in my hand and hadn‚Äôt even set my things down yet. But 30 minutes later, I accidentally fell asleep. That‚Äôs when the yelling started.

My brother came into my room and said that Dad was calling me. I asked what was going on, and my brother told me to ""get the damn dogs."" I responded, ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù in a cranky tone because I had just woken up. My dad then said, ‚ÄúDo you want to repeat that?‚Äù‚Äîwhich is his way of warning me not to use a certain tone. So I responded sarcastically, ‚ÄúSure, Dad. Let the dogs up!‚Äù I admit I shouldn‚Äôt have done that, but the argument escalated quickly. I kept asking him to drop it and let me go back to sleep.

In frustration, I texted in our family group chat that he was a ‚Äúfucking asshole.‚Äù My brother, who hadn‚Äôt heard the full argument, replied, ‚ÄúShut up, you‚Äôre in the wrong.‚Äù I was overwhelmed and in the middle of an anger episode. I stormed into his room, yelling that he only heard two sentences and didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about.

My dad came upstairs and got in my face, chest-to-chest like he usually does. I shouted that he was a weak excuse for a father and had abused me. In response, he mocked me. ‚ÄúAww really? I did that? Poor you. You gonna cry? Yeah, go cry to mommy,‚Äù he said while smirking. I told him, ‚ÄúFuck you,‚Äù and he laughed as he walked away.

I completely lost it. I tried calling my mom, but she didn‚Äôt answer. I put on my shoes, yelled that I wanted to die, and ran out the back door, saying my brother could look after the dogs. I walked by the dike near our house for over an hour in 3¬∞C weather, wearing just pajama pants and a tank top with no sweater.

Later, my mom texted me to come home and said my dad was in his room. I came back and locked myself in my room. That night, I relapsed after being eight months clean from self-harm. I was so ashamed.

The next day, I had therapy. Then on Monday, my dad sent me a message (attached image). That night we had a ‚Äúfamily meeting‚Äù to talk about everything. It went terribly. No one listened to me except for my mom. My dad twisted my words, saying I told him I wished he were dead‚Äîwhich I absolutely did not say. My brother backed him up, insisting I did. It only escalated. My dad kept rolling his eyes while I spoke, and eventually I told my mom I needed to leave because I couldn‚Äôt be around them anymore. My dad sneered, ‚ÄúYeah, run away like you always fucking do.‚Äù

I went to my room and texted my mom that I needed to be admitted to a mental health facility or I was going to end my life. The next day, we met with my therapist and began working on a safety plan.

Things are somewhat better now, but my dad never apologized. I‚Äôm still forced to get coffee with him every week, and it feels like torture. He constantly tries to start arguments, and while I‚Äôve been learning in therapy how to disengage, it‚Äôs exhausting. I‚Äôm doing so much hard emotional work in therapy to become a better person‚Äîbut he refuses to go to therapy because he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want someone telling him he‚Äôs wrong.‚Äù

I‚Äôm just so, so tired.

1kd8e23,https://i.redd.it/bri1osvfveye1.png,Stairway In The Darkroom,"I had a fun session last Thursday that I was asked to share.¬†¬†That night, I was up until 12:30am for work.  Our team was conducting maintenance, and there were problems along the way.  I did my best to keep my internal dialogue under control and not burn attention unnecessarily or get anxious about potentially missing practice.¬†¬†In the end, everything worked out, and we were successful.  It was a huge relief.¬†¬†

I woke up at 3 am and snoozed until 3:45.  I was tired but managed to put on my eye mask, roll off the sofa, and start to recap.¬†¬†After I finished recapping the day's events, I chugged some cold coffee from earlier and started my passes.

Tensegrity - DVD Vol 1, unbending intent(mashing & stirring energy), life saver pass, Westwood series(center for decisions, recapitulation, dreaming, inner silence), DVD Vol 2 with the affection for energy body pass integrated.¬†¬†Wrapped up around 5:50 am and sat to gaze.¬†¬†

During seated gazing, I saw a flat textured surface in the distance, which is a typical sight at this point.  A blocky pinkish 3D staircase slowly assembled itself around eye level.  I watched it form and noticed 'Candle' at the top step.¬†¬†Edges of the stairs were defined, and the steps were solid; the candle flame had a multi-colored shine.¬†¬†

In my last post, I mentioned seeing a simple lit candle; I've seen it every session since.¬† Occasionally, I use the candle as a silence meter; when I've maintained a reduced internal dialogue, the candle will appear with a bright or multi-colored flame.  The stick will be detailed with a strong outline or 3D appearance.¬†¬†If I'm struggling with internal chatter, the candle will appear but with a faint outline.  Sometimes, the bird that visits me during my sessions will fly out of the candle flame.¬†¬†

After the staircase disappeared, I didn't see anything else; knowing I had to start my day at 6:45, I rested on my right side, rocks still between my fingers, eye mask still on, and eyes still open.

Within seconds, I was looking at whitish smoke/fog and found myself staring at blue formations flowing between two parallel white lines in the distance to my right; I thought, ""Ice cave."" I remember seeing a flame to my left.  Everything else was black.¬†¬†There was an IOB presence; I don't recall the details; I just know I wasn't alone.

Then I found myself in a dream, where I found my hands, changed dreams, and did tensegrity multiple times.  Below are the details but marked as a spoiler:  

>!Sitting on the grass in front of a house.  I looked at my hands and saw missing fingers, felt the texture of the grass, and looked at my hands again; moving was difficult, and I felt heavier than usual in dreaming, but I managed to do a few dream passes.  The dream changed.  I was inside the house, thought I was awake, and looked at my hands.  They were dream hands.  Someone who looked like my mom but was taller and had different hair was standing there very still.  I purposely ignored it(in other darkroom dreams, I've been grabbed by people who looked like my mother).  More kept showing up, performed dream passes again.  A sofa seat scooped me up and started bumping me around the room, into and partially through walls like I would if pushing a kid around playing, then it dumped me into a multi-tiered swimming pool with people in it.  There was a wall of water coming out of the pool, like the 'ocean' from Moana.  At that point, I completely lost rationality.!<  

I found myself back on the sofa, gazing with my eyes open.  I took off my mask.  The ceiling was covered by multi-colored TV static.¬†¬†Checked my phone.  It was 6:30, fifteen minutes early, I felt energized and wrote my notes, and by the time I finished writing, the alarm went off.",8,1746211102.0,castaneda,3,1.0,False

I know I am extremely grateful to have employment in this job market. It has taken me literal years to get to this point of a job like this again. But man am i just struggling to make it to that first paycheck in two weeks. Ive been eating pb&j every single day. I stopped drinking coffee entirely at home because the milk and creamer cost. 

I am driving on the most questionable tire. Its completely bald and chords showing and i commute far to work. I just replaced a tire not even two weeks ago with a used one after it got a bolt lodged in it. But this ones now bald as fuck of course. Im trying so hard to just make it to payday but its storming so bad and the traction is terrible. Im concerned i‚Äôll either spin out or the thing will pop and my tire pressure sensor batteries died forever ago so i wouldnt even get an alert while driving. 

Every single day i have to wake up an hour and half to 2 hours before i need to be at work to get ready and drive there due to traffic. Then it takes even longer to get home because again, traffic. 

Every single day i get off work and back home around 6:30ish i‚Äôm changing then doing gig apps like doordash and uber til 11pm. I busted my ass all month earlier doing insanely long days trying to get it all together before this job started to avoid this exact stress and exhaustion but it was so fucking dead on those apps or such garbage orders that cost more in gas, it was horrible. Im still $250 short for rent and i have to deal with this tire which is going to set me back even more then ofc im out of gas so there goes another $45. You pay rent late then its just another $165 late fees there goes a chunk of that first check making you broke as shit all over again for two weeks. Just $$$$ everywhere its exhausting. Every single day is the most exhausting time. It makes me not even want to be awake. Everything revolves around money‚Ä¶.

But even thrift stores are so stupidly expensive its like the cost of a new shirt at ross or something. Its ridiculous.

I feel... weirdly good about it.,"So, rewind to early 2021. I was freelancing as a motion designer/video editor for a ""high-growth startup"" (aka: they had money but no soul). My deal? Crank out branded social content, ads, reels, TikToks, anything they could shove into the content meat grinder. I was churning through dozens of projects a week for *peanuts*. Not even salty peanuts. Stale-ass, bargain bin, bottom-of-the-barrel peanuts.

The pay sucked, but I was broke and scared, and they dangled the usual carrot  ‚Äúif things go well, there might be a permanent position down the line.‚Äù Spoiler: there wasn‚Äôt.

The vibe in the office was straight-up dystopian. The kind of place where middle managers treated gaslighting like a sport. I‚Äôd see people get into screaming matches over Instagram captions. HR was a ghost. I kept my head down, worked my ass off, and avoided the passive-aggressive coffee machine wars.

After a few months of this grind, I finally mustered the nerve to ask for a raise. I came in with data  engagement up, CTR up, conversions up  all thanks to the content I was making. I showed them charts, case studies, industry salary comparisons. I even lowballed myself *on purpose* just to make the ask more palatable.

Their response? They fired me. That same afternoon. Said I was ""not aligned with the company‚Äôs trajectory"" and that I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt demonstrating enough growth mindset.‚Äù Translation: ‚ÄúYou made us look good, now get out.‚Äù

I was wrecked. It took me forever to find stable work again. I moved on eventually, but that chapter always felt... unfinished.

Fast forward to this morning. I‚Äôm cleaning out old digital crap and stumble on a Google Drive I forgot I even had. One folder still has daily activity. Curious, I click in. It‚Äôs *them*. The same company. Still using MY assets. Templates, LUTs, After Effects rigs, fonts I licensed, entire libraries I made from scratch. Stuff I *built*.

They were still logged in. Still piggybacking on my driv,e a drive I‚ÄôVE been paying for. My work, my cloud, my dime.

So, I backed it all up locally. Hit select all. Delete.

It‚Äôs gone. All of it. The scaffolding for their entire content engine? Vaporized. Tomorrow, they‚Äôre gonna open Premiere and see a whole lot of ""media offline.""

I love her and we've had a lot of great times but recently I can't help but to feel like I'm being used and undervalued and like she's checked out of our relationship. 

When we initially got together, she told me that she had a lot of past partners, and went through a phase of tons of random hookups. I consider myself to be an understanding person and try not to judge people, so it didn't bother me too much until we separated for a week in late October. I was feeling very depressed and knowing that she struggles as well I felt like I had to withdraw. In our conversation she told me she'd be there waiting for me and wanted to reconnect and I told her I would once I'm able to feel like myself again. 

A week later (early November) she texted me, and I agreed to go out with her. I was happy to reconnect and we had a nice time until the end when, knowing how she'd acted in the past, I asked her if she'd been with anyone else in that week. She told me that she'd made out and ""fooled around"" with someone at a party. I was shocked and asked her if she'd had sex with him. I told her that if she had had sex with him I wouldn't be able to continue seeing her. She tearfully told me that she hadn't, and I chose to believe her.

This really stuck with me and was something I dwelled on a lot, for months and months. I felt horrible about it. I'd gotten cheated on and abused in my last relationship and I felt worried that our relationship could become like that. I worried about what taking her back after that says about me. I felt like I couldn't trust her. 

Around 3 weeks ago, it got worse. She texted me and randomly asked me if I get ever get anxious about our relationship. I told her yes, and she instantly called me. She was tearful and speaking really fast and having a panic attack. She said she'd been feeling overwhelmed with guilt about what she'd done in the week that we were separated. 

Confused, I told her that it was okay because she'd been honest with me and told me everything. Then she let it slip that she'd had sex with that guy, and seen another in the same week. I was stunned. I told her that that didn't match up with what she'd told me when we got back together. Then she tried to gaslight me and told me that she'd been honest with me then. I felt sick to my stomach, and she was panicking and crying so I agreed to come to her house and talk about it all.

When I arrived, she apologized for lying. I'd told her many, many times before that I need complete honesty after what happened to me in my last relationship. Honesty is one of the most important things to me. She was crying and I didn't know what to do and I'm so bad at holding boundaries with people so I agreed to stay with her. I ended up comforting her. 

  
A fucking week later she tells me she forgot to tell me that she'd made plans with her ex that same week. She'd planned for them to go out together and then have a sleepover at her place. I remember that when we got back together she'd spun a completely different story: she told me that he'd been bothering her and asked to get coffee, but she'd said no. I didn't know what to do and just sat there like an idiot feeling horrible.

A few days later I made a mistake. I'd slept over the night before and she left for work, leaving her iPad. Convinced that she was lying to me about more things, I went through it. I read texts between her and her ex, saying that she missed him around the time that we got back together. I read some texts between her and friends, she was bragging about what happened, going into extreme detail, and more. She was bragging about past things. I found a note called ""snack list"" in which she detailed 16 hookups (before our relationship, but still). She was constantly talking shit on me. I went through a really rough depressive episode in the fall and winter and she was telling her friends all about it and how ""checked out"" she was with me and how I wasn't doing enough because I was too depressed to go above and beyond in those moments and that she wasn't the center of attention, even though I always tried my hardest. She told her friends that she was gonna break up with me because of it. It was so astonishing because I'd opened up to her about feeling that way and she'd comforted me, told me she understood and was there for me, and that everything was okay. 

She was acting completely different from how she presents herself to be with me. Meanwhile she'd been telling me I was the best guy in the world, treating her better than she'd ever been treated. Some of those things are burned into my brain. 

I felt and still feel disgusted and emasculated and like I can't trust her. I can't view her in the same way and feel like all of our good moments mean nothing if she was lying this whole time. I feel betrayed, and like I don't really know her. I've been silently second guessing every act and word of affection since. Everything feels fake.

I don't know how I deserve this. I try so hard with her. I'm ALWAYS patient and I ALWAYS listen and give her good, caring, loving support. I try to do fun things with her, excite her, make her feel loved, and treat her as best I can. I try to be the best boyfriend I can be. 

Recently, she's been communicating with me less and has been acting off. She's been meaner and more self centered and less affectionate. She talks about her exes all the time. We rarely have sex anymore, and oftentimes she'll barely even kiss me. I second guess myself and wonder why she was able to do all of the things she did so freely with all of these people but won't with me, and what that says about me.

Nearly every day we have long talks about her feelings and her issues, in which I try to be very supportive and caring. She pushes me to open up but when I actually do she makes it about herself or gets upset with me for calmly bringing up issues I have and then I end up comforting her. 

I'm patient but I have needs too and this is really wearing me down. I feel like I'm being used and like my feelings don't matter. I feel that no matter what I do I can't reach her and she's secretly feeling all these bad things about me (like the stuff i read or worse).  I worry about so many things and I feel exhausted. The good times we have are becoming more and more infrequent. I'm tired of going above and beyond for someone who doesn't appreciate me, doesn't treat me well, and lies to me. She lied to me, and because of that I can't trust her. I don't know how we can rebuild trust when she's acting like this. I can't get what she did out of my head.

How can I fix this? I love her and don't want to lose her, but every time I've tried to talk to her about needing things to change and how we'd change things it seems to go nowhere or get worse.  

  
TLDR: 

my girlfriend and I broke up for a week in October. When we got back together she told me that she hadn't had sex with anyone. Recently, she accidentally admitted that she had and tried to gaslight me about it. Then she revealed a lot more about what happened that week, including making plans with her ex. I checked her iPad and saw a lot of things I wish I never saw and can't stop feeling disgusted and distrustful. She's been withdrawing and becoming less affectionate and I don't know what to do because I try so hard to be a good boyfriend.",2,1746210310.0,relationship_advice,6,0.75,False

I hope you're haunted when you see specific green things. When you hear my extremely common first name and surname. I hope I've ruined your fave bands because of our old playlist.

No more vimto & pb cups for you, sucks to suck. Maybe a pang of pain everytime someone uses a green heart emoji. I bet you can't even see Pokemon without being reminded of me. Cafe Nero, say bye to that. How about all the popular tv shows we liked, and watched together?

Haunted by me when you see my eyes, my hair, my piercings, my smile, in other people.

Well, be haunted by this.

You did all this. When you're lying in bed alone in 10 years time and you remember what we had and then you remember that you threw that away. No one else. All you. Your doing. Your fault. You threw away someone who loved you.

Who helped you out when you were facing problems because of your disability, who held you at night and upon waking in the morning, kissed you and brushed the hair out of your face, who helped you relentlessly through mental health crises, who bought you silly ""just because I love you"" gifts, who would lug your suitcase up and down flights of stairs because you couldn't, the one who knew where you liked to be intimately touched in all those unconventional places, who made you laugh, who was preparing her home to adapt you and your needs before you moved in...

Who stuck by you after you lied to and cheated on her. The one you abandoned. Yes, her. You know who she is. The girl with the red hair, green eyes, and a mutt accent.

You remember it all vividly, you deeply feel the regret and the shame, and you proceed to

Remember. It. Well.

1kd7xom,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1kd7xom/can_coffee_cause_heart_palpitations_that_linger/,Can coffee cause heart palpitations that linger for several days?,"So, heart palps are something I occasionally have regardless of anxiety. But lately, they've been a bit more noticable. There's no pain/breathing issues, and they don't last long (only 3-5 seconds max). I usually only have one of these a day/every other day lately. Normally, they're even rarer. The hard and irregular beating of my heart during those 3 seconds makes me quite nervous though (I have horrid health anxiety that I've only managed to get under control this year.)

Now, my question is, can consuming coffee cause this to happen more frequently? I know that I haven't had any significant anxiety this week, so it's not caused by anxiety itself, but I HAVE been drinking coffee daily due to my messy schedule. Normally, I only drink coffee when I have to stay up very late, which is rare. 

Could this increase in caffeine consumption have caused this? 

I know I likely don't have any heart issues, I've been checked by cardiologists several times throughout my life, the latest being around 3 months ago. So I don't want to fall into the trap of spiraling because of health anxiety. Doing that has given me IBS-like symptoms and left me basically crippled with anxiety for months last year, and I'm frankly done with all that bs. 

I do, however, need some reassurance that this is just a side effect of the caffeine consumption though, if someone has experienced something similar. Should avoid it completely? Try decaf? 

I have some leftover beta blocker tablets that my doc has given me to calm some of the physical symptoms of anxiety as needed. I've also started taking magnesium again, just in case a mineral imbalance might be contributing to this (I do eat unholy amounts of dairy, I'm guessing the calcium isn't helping lol.)

I actually have a PTSD diagnosis already from previous sexual violence. But this incident from a couple years ago is really fuzzy to me. I don‚Äôt know what to make of it. 

Ok here goes‚Ä¶


A few years ago I met a cop after I called the police to help me get a very drunk girl home safely from the bar. I didn‚Äôt know her, and her friends left her, which is why I had no other option. 

Anyway I ended up looking him up on LinkedIn after he drove me home from the hospital (I went with him to drop her off at the hospital- she was very sick) because I thought he was cute.

I saw he was getting his masters degree in social work at a women‚Äôs college (men can do grad programs) so I thought, oh wow, an evolved cop. 

He messaged me and said ‚Äúyou could‚Äôve just asked for my number‚Äù 

And from there, we started texting/hanging out casually- while he was working, like just doing surveillance or whatever small town cops do, I‚Äôd bring him a coffee and we‚Äôd chat. 

At the time, I was trying to live a Christian life and I told him I was planning on waiting until marriage to have sex. (Even though I wasn‚Äôt a virgin I‚Äôd been celibate like 4 years at that point. I came to religion later in life) 
He thought that was so cool, where have women like me been his whole life, etc. I also, just wasn‚Äôt ready for sex in general because I‚Äôve been SA‚Äôd many times in my life and I think my new religion was a good excuse to take a long break and think about my real feelings toward sex.

Anyway fast forward to our first official date. We went out to eat and things seemed pretty normal. Keep in mind he was completely off duty. 

He asked me to go to his car with him after we ate, just to talk. 

In the car, he had a gun openly in the center console. He made no mention of it but it was in clear sight. This was his personal vehicle. 

We start kissing, and it seems like he‚Äôs trying to push it further. Being the way I am, (a trauma survivor whose instinct is to fawn or freeze) I keep trying to keep it light and just be smiley and jokey about not wanting to progress, but was still open to kissing. 

Eventually he got me to put my hand on him, if you know what I mean, and he was grabbing my head and saying to say ‚Äúyes to daddy‚Äù 

I had not given him any signal I was into this kind of thing. If I‚Äôm honest, I was torn. Part of me reacted (physically, if you know what I mean.) but mentally I knew I didn‚Äôt want this and kept saying no. I think maybe I was partially just activated by adrenaline and fear. 

It didn‚Äôt go further than a HJ. But even that I was very reluctant to do. I eventually got him to drive me back to my car. (He had driven us somewhere more private) I told him there were too many people around or made up some other excuse, because clearly my nos weren‚Äôt working and I can‚Äôt help but think maybe jts because they were not firm enough and came across as teasing or me wanting to be dominated? 

After he left and I got into my own car, I was shaking from head to toe. Physically shaking. And I felt very dizzy, like very dissociative. Feeling that way itself was super triggering to me. 

I told him he didn‚Äôt respect my celibacy (via text) after this incident, and he kept texting me. I blocked him. 

It never occurred to me until years later, that with the gun present, and his insistence, it could be assault ish? 

I read he was accused of excessive force on a little old lady a year later (while working as a cop)

I feel dumb, ashamed, embarrassed that even a little part of me was turned on. ",2,1746209830.0,ptsd,4,1.0,False

1kd7vg7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kd7vg7,Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht - Exactly what we wanted,"Hello Everyone,

We had a wonderful stay at the Andaz in Amsterdam where we stayed for 7 nights and wanted to share our experience!

Planning:
My wife and I were planning a trip to the Low Countries. We decided to use Amsterdam as our home base. The plan was to stay in central Amsterdam but we wanted to be away from the hustle and bustle of the city center. We researched a couple of hotels but reviewed were all over the place and we couldn‚Äôt really get a clear answer. Also some of the hotels recommended were in spots I was not too sure about so I wanted an expert‚Äôs opinion. I emailed u/sarahwlee and her team since we have used them for past vacations and got a response back immediately saying they highly recommend staying in the Jordaan and specifically at the Andaz. The booking process was super easy. I was able to add my Hyatt loyalty number and I had confirmations immediately from Hyatt after booking through Sarah‚Äôs portal. The next day I was told we were upgraded from a Garden view to a Canal view which was awesome. Also, breakfast was included which was a nice to have. Will never book hotels alone again and will always use a trusted travel agent. 

Arrival:
The hotel sent a car to pick us up at our request (we did not want to deal with the taxi line at AMS during the heavy travel season) and the driver met us right after customs. We were whisked away in a Maybach S550 which was an awesome experience. We had arrived super early at the hotel (09:50 local time) so they let us know our room wasn‚Äôt quite ready but they would let us know when it was and gave us recommendations for what we could do in the meantime. We left our bags and went on a quick walk and our room was ready shortly after. 

Room:
We arrived back to the hotel and were given our keys. Our bags were already in the room along with a gift from Sarah‚Äôs team and the hotel itself. It was a really neat touch. The room layout was wonderful and the canal view was spectacular. It is a big room by European standards and the AC was particularly nice to have. The shower was awesome, there was plenty of closet space, and we really enjoyed the wallpaper in the toilet (pictures of it above). 

Hotel:
The lobby was really nice. One of our tour guides  let us know that the building used to be an old library and it was designed by Marcel Wanders who is known as a ‚Äúbad boy‚Äù when it comes to Dutch architecture. I think he meant that he went against the grain and the hotel is definitely modern and quirky but in a good way! The hotel staff were all wonderful as well. They helped us get reservations at Ciel Bleu and other restaurants during our visit and gave us pointers and things to check out while we were there. Also, may seem minor, but every night while returning to the hotel, they would offer us water and give us some to take back to our room in these huge glass bottles. This was nice as we drink a lot of water normally and it was great to stock up for the night and morning. 

Dining:
We initially thought we wouldn‚Äôt use breakfast that much but we did on the first day and several other days. The spread was great and they had good coffee. Also, they had a few dishes you could order from a menu which was a nice touch as well. (I got the salmon Benedict whenever we visited and it was delicious!) We also got stroopwaffels and heated it on our coffee as we ate and it was super good. The bar and restaurant at the hotel were nice as well! We only dined once but had a few night caps there where they whipped up some really tasty cocktails.  They also had a wine happy hour included every night where they would have some light appetizers and glasses of wine which was great!

Location:
When we visit again, we will definitely be staying in the Jordaan district. It is super close to everything and the canals are wonderful there. It is also out of the way enough where we avoided people celebrating their bachelor parties or having stag nights in the red light district. All the buildings were beautiful and the area was very clean, especially when compared to other major European cities. 

Overall we had a wonderful stay at the Andaz Amsterdam. When we return we will definitely be staying there again! Feel free to ask questions if you have any and I‚Äôll respond as best I can.

It was a solo date. So I‚Äôm an introvert, and going out alone usually feels like a nightmare. But after being cooped up at home for so long cuz of JEE and other entrance exams, I was losing my mind. So today, I went on a solo date and god it was tough. I was so nervous, felt like I was going to commit a robbery or something.
There weren't much people in the cafe. The staff were really nice. I ordered a cold coffee. It was really good. The place had great music and vibes. Didn't click more pictures. Sat there for about 30-40 minutes and it  turned out to be a great experience. 
10/10 reccomended!!!

1kd7tdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1kd7tdu/my_partner_asked_me_not_to_mask/,My partner asked me not to mask,"I am a highly anxious person, especially socially. As a result, I don't have many friends. This has been a point of contention in my relationship as my partner feels the pressure of being my 'everything person'.
He has asked me to accompany him to various social outings, some of which I have been able to attend, and others unable.

Last night, he told me his best friend invited us to go to their place for coffee today. I reluctantly said yes, as his best friend's gf would be there and it was an attempt at making me a new friend. I've met the best friend a few times but never chatted much and the girlfriend only once, about 1.5 years ago, and we barely spoke more than a hi/bye. 
Anyway, after I said yes, he noticed I was anxious and he tried reassuring me that they want to get to know me and I'm an interesting person, etc etc. Then he asked if I could promise him that I wouldn't mask with them. I immediately said no and I've felt terrible ever since. 
I know he meant it in the way that they would like me without my mask, but it feels like a criticism. Like this tool I've used my whole life to protect myself is thought of as an overreaction.

Has anyone else had a similar situation? How did you address it with your partner?",30,1746209624.0,AutismInWomen,16,1.0,False
