I also love my couch at 9 pm a little too much. Most nights I clock out, do bottles and bedtime, then I just stare at a wall. Not sleepy, just empty. I hate it because I want to be present, not the guy who disappears after dishes.

Day job is 9 to 6. Nights are unpredictable. Sleep is 6 to 7 hours and choppy. Coffee at 7 and sometimes at 2. If the day is rough I grab a Red Bull and regret it later. Meals are rushed and usually carb heavy, which does not help. I tried a few things. A 20 minute walk at lunch. Magnesium glycinate at night. Cold shower splashes. Some days it helps. Most days the tank still reads E.

If you have been here, what actually moved the needle. I am open to supplement stacks (someone mentioned Seed, V•Nella, pendulum) that did not wreck your gut. Timing tricks for caffeine so the 3 pm crash does not nuke the evening. Simple meals that keep energy steady when dinner is chaos. Micro workouts that fit between naps. Sleep rules that work with a baby in the house. If you track with a watch and saw real changes, share that too. 

I am looking for stuff that makes me a better dad and partner between 6 and 10. What worked for you.",1,1766009504.0,daddit,0,1.0,False

I feel like I’m in the home stretch of finally figuring out my delicate flower of a stomach. I’m sick of it ruling my life and will likely not be sugar-coating the poop talk (holy mother of ew) so proceed at your own squeamishness tolerance.

I started the reintroduction stage today, did my regular routine of psyllium husk when I woke up then shower then breakfast. But I had 1/4 cup of milk after the psyllium husk. 

So it went:

5:30am

Psyllium husk

65mls Milk 

5:50ish

Gluten free weetbix

Lactose free milk

Coffee

6:15ish

Poop. 

Volume-wise I knew I wasn’t done for the day. 

Bristol chart-wise it was probably 3-4.

I was maybe a bit light on fibre yesterday. 

8:20ish

Poop. 

Volume-wise I think my colon can clock off for the day. 

Getting into 4-5 range on the Bristol chart. 

8:52

I’m currently having another coffee with lactose free milk. Feeling fine so far. 

I feel like today was inconclusive and that I definitely need to do day 2 of reintroduction - 130mls milk. 

My question: 

Is it super important that I wait until tomorrow morning?

If I had the milk sometime this evening so I can experience the joys of whatever happens at home and not at work does that mess with the science-side of this whole journey? 

Eg. If I did it at 9:30 tonight that would be 16 hours (probably, my maths skills are about as strong as my gut) from this morning’s test and 8 hours from when I would do it tomorrow morning.

Is that close enough?

Thanks for any and all advice. 

Side-note: I am going to be furious/devastated if this is a trigger, I was so confident I would get a gold star on lactose. 

I was diagnosed coeliac around three years ago and once I’d done the gastroscopy and was gluten-free for 6 months, I was feeling way better but thought I could still improve so I decided to test out dairy. 

I went totally dairy free for 3 weeks and then drank a litre of milk in like 20 minutes and was fine! Why would lactose betray me now, all I’ve ever done was love it!",1,1766009405.0,FODMAPS,1,1.0,False

1pp9nz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SubstituteTeachers/comments/1pp9nz0/rough_day/,Rough Day,"Today was probably one of the worst days I’ve had, specifically because of full-time staff. I had subbed at this school once and the admin was unpleasant the first time, giving so much attitude, becuase I didn’t know where to go.

Today, I signed in and greeted her, yet she wouldn’t even look up at me, I wished her a good day and only then did she look up, to roll her eyes at me. Luckily I knew where my class was so I just walked out and went on my way. 

On my first break, my co-teacher told me I could feel free to take coffee and a donut that a family had bought for the staff. As I went for a coffee one of the other teachers in the staff room started screaming at me saying, “You can’t have that! It’s for staff only, not you supplies!” I was so embarrassed that I meekly said I was told I could, and then walked out. 

I went about my day and planned to talk to the VP about how rude she was. I understand that some families may not account for all staff when dropping off food, but the way the teacher spoke to me felt so degrading. 

Later on, one of my Kindergarteners needed assistance in the bathroom, and the one in our class was flooding onto the floor. I took that child with me to another class, not knowing it was the teacher who yelled at me earlier. I knocked on her door and she waved me in, I apologized for the interruption (they were with a prep coverage teacher but the full time teacher was still in the room) and she went off on me again, screaming “You have your own bathroom, you can’t use mine!” I tried to explain ours wasn’t available and she stormed out of the room to a door that had a women’s bathroom sign on it, and said, “THIS is the other kindergarten bathroom! Don’t use mine, and don’t come back to my class!” 

I helped my kindergarten get dressed and we went back to class, where I saw the VP waiting to speak with me, claiming, “you were being extremely rude to [teacher that yelled at me twice] and that I wouldn’t be welcomed back to the school for your shift on Friday”

I can’t believe the way some staff treat substitute staff! I was so embarrassed all day long, and wouldn’t plan to go back to that school either way. ",1,1766009335.0,SubstituteTeachers,1,1.0,False

Any suggestions on location or microwave diagram? Saw something about a freezer trick but I’m assuming it’s one of those that blows and is dead, instead of coming back to life after temperature drops.

I get it potential buyers likely messaged many people, try to lowball and go by best offer or to re-sell, are lazy to commute and demanding to meet ASAP.

I’ve always struggled with the *messy middle* of productivity — the brain-dumps, half-notes, reminders scribbled everywhere, and that feeling of knowing I’m busy but not actually calm.

Over the past while, I ended up building a small personal-first tool for myself that helps turn that chaos into a simple daily plan — not a hardcore system, just enough structure to breathe again.

It’s made me realize something though:  
**everyone seems to have their own “coffee-fueled” way of organizing life**, and I’m honestly more curious about *that* than promoting anything.

So I wanted to ask:

* Do you rely on tasks? notes? calendars? sticky notes?
* Do you prefer simple lists or more flexible systems?
* What’s one thing that *always* throws your productivity off?

If anyone’s curious, I’m happy to share what I built — but mostly I’d love to hear how others here tame their dragons of distraction ☕🐉",1,1766009041.0,Productivitycafe,1,1.0,False

Despite rumors of changes, the 3-1-1 rule remains in place at most airports globally:

* **3.4 ounces (100ml)** maximum per container
* **1 quart-sized clear plastic bag**
* **1 bag per passenger**

**Important exceptions**:

* Prescription medications (keep in original containers)
* Baby formula, breast milk, and baby food
* Medically necessary liquids

# Recent Changes to Watch

**Good news for some travelers**: Airports with new CT (Computed Tomography) scanners don't require you to remove liquids or laptops. These are rolling out gradually at major airports worldwide.

**UK airports** (Edinburgh, Birmingham, some London airports) now allow up to 2 liters of liquids with the new technology, though this rollout has faced delays.

**US developments**: As of July 2025, TSA eliminated the shoe removal requirement thanks to new scanning technology. However, liquid restrictions remain in place for now.

# Electronics and Batteries

**Power up your devices**: TSA officers may ask you to turn on your phone, laptop, or tablet. Powerless devices will not be permitted onboard.

**Battery restrictions**:

* Lithium batteries must be under 100 watt-hours
* Spare batteries must be in carry-on (never checked luggage)
* Battery packs and power banks: carry-on only

# Commonly Prohibited Items

# Never Allowed (Carry-on or Checked)

* Explosives and flammable items
* Bear spray and mace (except checked in some cases)
* Strike-anywhere matches
* Self-heating meals (MREs)

# Carry-On Prohibited (Checked OK)

* Knives of any length
* Scissors over 4 inches
* Tools (wrenches, screwdrivers over 7 inches)
* Sporting equipment (baseball bats, hockey sticks)
* Self-defense items (except TSA-approved in checked bags)

**Important**: Firearms must be unloaded, in a locked hard case, and declared in checked baggage only.

# Customs and Declarations

# What You MUST Declare

**Currency**: Most countries require declaration of amounts over $10,000 (US/Canada) or equivalent.

**Purchases abroad**: Everything you bought, even if it was ""duty-free"" at the airport. The duty-free exemption just means you didn't pay local taxes there.

**Gifts**: Yes, even presents for others count toward your exemption.

**When in doubt, declare it**: Penalties for not declaring can be severe, including item forfeiture and fines.

# Duty-Free Limits by Region

**United States**:

* $800 exemption (48+ hours abroad, once every 30 days)
* $200 exemption (under 48 hours)
* 1 liter of alcohol (must be 21+)
* 200 cigarettes or 100 cigars

**European Union**:

* Varies by country, typically €300-€430 for air/sea travelers
* Stricter limits on alcohol and tobacco

**Australia**: AUD $900 (approximately USD $600)

**Canada**: CAD $800 (after 48+ hours)

# Notable Country-Specific Rules

**Australia**: Extremely strict about food items. Fresh fruits, vegetables, seeds, and animal products are heavily restricted. Declare everything or face hefty fines.

**New Zealand**: Similar to Australia with biosecurity. Even hiking boots must be declared if they have soil on them.

**Singapore**: Heavy penalties for drugs (including some prescription medications) and chewing gum restrictions.

**UAE/Middle East**: Strict on alcohol imports and certain medications. Check specific rules before traveling.

**Japan**: Prescription medications require documentation. Some common over-the-counter drugs in other countries are prohibited.

# Pro Tips for Smooth Processing

**Arrive early**: 2 hours domestic, 3 hours international. Security lines can be unpredictable.

**Pack smart**:

* Empty your carry-on completely before repacking for trips
* Place liquids in an easily accessible pocket
* Wear slip-on shoes for faster screening
* Put laptops and large electronics where you can quickly remove them

**Use technology**:

* Mobile Passport Control (MPC) app speeds up US customs
* Canada's CBSA Declaration App lets you submit info before landing
* Many countries now accept e-passports at automated gates

**Keep receipts**: Especially for expensive purchases. Makes customs declarations easier and proves value if questioned.

**Research before you buy**: That beautiful ivory carving or exotic animal product? Probably illegal to import. Check before purchasing souvenirs.

# Digital Declarations

Many countries now offer apps to submit customs declarations before arrival:

* US: Mobile Passport Control
* Canada: CBSA Declaration App
* EU: Some airports accept advance declarations

# Food and Agricultural Products

This trips up many travelers. Generally:

**Usually OK**:

* Packaged, processed foods
* Vacuum-sealed cheeses
* Chocolate, candy, coffee
* Spices and dried herbs

**Usually NOT OK**:

* Fresh fruits and vegetables
* Meat products (with few exceptions)
* Plants and seeds
* Soil or items with soil

# If You're Selected for Additional Screening

**Stay calm and cooperative**: Security officers are doing their job.

**Don't joke**: Comments about bombs, weapons, or terrorism can result in arrest.

**Know your rights**: You can request private screening if needed.

**Be patient**: Additional screening happens to random passengers and those flagged by algorithms.

# Recent Global Updates

**Real ID (US)**: Required for domestic flights as of May 7, 2025

**Facial recognition**: Being rolled out at major airports worldwide. You can opt out if you have privacy concerns.

**Automated lanes**: Many airports now have automated screening lanes with CT scanners and conveyor systems.

1pp9ixg,https://i.redd.it/6ze7s34d7u7g1.png,"A trial photo of Bernard Schreiber, 18, sentenced to death in 1955 for raping and murdering a 17-year-old girl to ""prove his manhood"". Schreiber, then 17 himself, stalked the girl for 3 days, then attacked her when she spurned his advances. He was the last juvenile offender to be executed in Ohio.","[""Capital Punishment of Children in Ohio: ""They'd Never Send a Boy of Seventeen to the Chair in Ohio, Would They?](https://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1823&context=akronlawreview)

Bernard Schreiber was born in Monclova in 1937. He had never been in trouble before and was friends with several younger boys. They frequently messed with him since he had only had one date with a girl and was a virgin. So, Schreiber decided to change that. In August 1954, Schreiber and a 12-year-old companion were in Sylvania Township when a 17-year-old school girl whom they did not know, Mary Jolene Freiss, rode past on a bicycle going for the mail. Schreiber immediately took a liking to her. The two boys proceeded to follow the girl for three days, watching her make trips to a mail box. On the third day, Schreiber approached Friess. The girl immediately spurned his advances.

The next day, the two boys hid in some weeds alongside the path taken by Friess. When the girl rode pass, the two ambushed her. The younger boy knocked her off her bicycle by a hit to the head with a club. Friess dizzily fled into the woods, but was struck twice more and knocked unconscious. The younger boy then left the scene. Schreiber then dragged Mary deeper into the woods, tore up her clothes, and raped her. When Mary regained consciousness, Schreiber became worried that she would identify him. He stabbed the girl twice in the chest, killing her. He then went home and ate lunch.

[The girl, Mary Jolene Friess](https://imgur.com/a/photo-of-mary-jolene-friess-Nplrf9O)

[Bernard Schreiber's arrest and confession](https://imgur.com/a/a7ePGVN)

About a week later, the police received a tip from a neighbor, who reported that Schreiber had confessed to his mother, saying, ""I just killed a girl. I stabbed her twice."" Schreiber's mother said she was horrified by her son's confession, but wasn't sure what to do. After initially denying his guilt, Schreiber confessed after failing a lie detector test. Before making his statement, Schreiber took the police to a dump two miles from the scene. There, they found fragments of the girl's eyeglasses. After returning, Schreiber put his feet on the prosecutor's desk, puffed a pipe, and related how he and the younger boy had planned the crime. Sipping a cup of coffee, he talked about how they had stalked her for days.

>""She looked good. We decided to wait for her. I was intrigued and aroused by the way she was dressed in bra and shorts. She had a pretty nice looking shape and that's what got me.""

When confronted by the police, the younger boy cried and denied any involvement in the murder, but admitted to his initial participation.

The police asked Schreiber and the younger boy about unrelated things. Schreiber had aspired to became a Marine after his graduation. He enjoyed reading comic books, mainly about Superman and Captain Marvel, and usually stayed at home. When asked about television programs, he said he liked mysteries, ""especially those which send thrills down my spine like Dragnet."" He said he had no particular hobby, ""but liked to fool around with carpentry and mechanics."" The younger boy, described as small for his age, was called an average student and interested in sports. He'd followed his normal pursuits since the crime.

Schreiber remained at home, watching television and peering through his windows. Sheriff William Hirsch, described Schreiber, who was called ""a religious-minded youth who never missed mass,"" as ""a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."" Schreiber said that he and his accomplice had driven to the scene after the body was discovered. He spent about two hours in the Sheriff's posse, ""just to see how far they were getting with their investigation.""

Schreiber was charged with first degree murder. He was certified to stand trial as an adult and went on trial in January 1955. He waived his right to a jury trial and entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. At his trial, Schreiber said his accomplice was more culpable than he had initially claimed. What really happened, he said, was that the younger boy had told him, ""Go ahead, get it over with."" The boy waited at the road. When Schreiber returned to him 10 minutes later, he asked, ""Are you finished so soon?""

The younger boy had not been charged. Since he had supposedly disassociated himself from the crime by fleeing after knocking Friess unconscious, he could not be held liable as an accomplice to murder or rape. On account for his age, officials had not prosecuted him for assault. He had been released to his mother. At his trial, Schreiber said he'd changed his story after learning that if the younger boy was implicated in the murder, he'd be sent to a reform school until his 21st birthday.

On the stand, the younger boy denied all involvement.

Four psychiatrists testified that Schreiber was sane, but intellectually disabled. They said he had the mentality of an 11-year-old. He was in 11th grade, but was rated at the seventh grade level. Nevertheless, Lucas County prosecutor Harry Friberg pushed for a death sentence. He said Schreiber's age, somewhat impoverished background, and learning difficulties did not warrant leniency given the brutality of the crime.

>""Nevermind, and I mean never, should this man be in a position to commit a similar crime again.""

He noted that Schreiber had used a hunting knife, not a pocket knife.

[Schreiber is sentenced](https://imgur.com/a/yohK9xN)

A three-judge panel deliberated for an hour before finding him guilty of first degree murder and sentencing him to death by electrocution. A plea for a second degree murder conviction or at least an attachment of mercy to a first degree murder conviction were rejected. Schreiber had admitted that he stabbed Friess a second time since he thought he'd missed her heart the first time. Upon hearing the sentence, Schreiber dropped his head and closed his eyes. His mother became hysterical and his two sisters sobbed. Schreiber later said the decision felt ""just like they had shoved a knife in me.""

On June 28, 1955, an appellate court confirmed the verdict in a 2-1 decision. On December 14, 1955, the Ohio Supreme Court rejected his appeal and scheduled his execution for January 13, 1956. On December 30, Governor Frank Lausche delayed the execution to March 15 so that Schreiber could ask for clemency. At a hearing in January, defense attorney Marcus L. Friedman told the Ohio Pardons and Parole Commission that Schreiber had been raised on the edge of poverty and never had a real break in his life. Friedman said clemency would be ""the first and last break he'll ever get.""

>""If he gets one now, he will never get another because he will be in prison the rest of his life.""

It's worth noting that this is false.

Life without parole did not become a sentencing option in Ohio until 1993. Any sentence less than death for Schreiber was virtually guaranteed to result in him being paroled in the 1970s or 1980s. That aside, Friedman noted the presence of other mitigating factors, such as Schreiber's age and learning difficulties. However, the panel was unmoved. On March 15, Schreiber lost his last hope of avoiding execution when Governor Lausche said he would not intervene. After counseling with his cabinet and reviewing the case, he announced, ""Based upon a careful study of the evidence in the case of Bernard Schreiber, I find the facts to be of a nature not warranting my intervention. The decisions respectively of the Common Pleas. Appellate and the Supreme Courts will not be disturbed.""

Schreiber, who was 17 years and 11 months old at the time of the murder, would be the last juvenile offender to be executed in Ohio. When the state reinstated the death penalty in 1981, lawmakers banned it for juveniles, solidifying his morbid historical footnote. Between 1880 and 1956, 19 juvenile offenders had been executed in Ohio, all of them for murder. All but one of them were at least 16 at the time of their crimes.

The exception was 16-year-old Gustave Ohr, who was hanged in 1880 for robbing and murdering a man when he was fifteen. Hanged him were his accomplice, 17-year-old George Mann, and 18-year-old John Sammett, who was 17 when he murdered a 16-year-old boy who'd testified against him in a burglary case. Even in 1880, some had pleaded for mercy on behalf of the three boys, who were also the first juvenile offenders to be executed in the state. Over the next 76 years, judges and juries in Ohio had become increasingly reluctant to condemn anyone that young to death.

Schreiber's near-adulthood contributed to his death sentence. At the trial, the prosecutor perceived and described Schreiber, now 18, as a young man, not a child.

Schreiber received a final visit from his family. His mother, a brother, and a sister came to say goodbye. His last meal consisted of fresh shrimp cocktail, roast prime ribs of beef, french fried potatoes, buttered whole greens, head lettuce with mayonnaise, pumpkin pie with ice cream, hot rolls and butter with strawberry preserves, coffee, milk, and Coca-Cola. A request by Schreiber to be allowed to eat his last meal with a prison buddy was granted. He ate with 26-year-old Benjamin Meyer, who had been convicted of murdering his estranged wife, 26-year-old Velvia Meyer, on February 15, 1954. Meyer had murdered his wife about two months after she initiated divorce proceedings against him. The two had gotten into a heated argument when Velvia refused to withdraw them. It ended with Meyer shooting Velvia, the mother of his five children, three times with a revolver.

At his trial, Meyer had argued that he was only guilty of second degree murder. He said the gun was meant for himself if his wife didn't drop the divorce proceedings.

>""Meyer wants you to believe he did the slaying in an unconscious state as the result of being struck on the head by a club.""

The prosecution said the crime was premeditated, noting that he had fired three shots and had previously spied on his wife. He had also initially lied to the police, saying he only shot his wife after she struck him with a club. In reality, his wife had done nothing. He was really struck by his wife's niece, 17-year-old Delores Sniff, with a hairbrush. Meyer said she had struck first, but couldn't remember much about what had happened. Delores testified that Meyer had arrived to her home uninvited and pushed his way inside. Her mother, Leila Sniff, said Meyer wasn't supposed to be there and that he should call the police, but did nothing. Meyer left the house, but was twice seen by Leila going around the back. Leila told him that her sister would be here soon and to wait at the front porch.

When his wife arrived, Meyer confronted her and pleaded with her to drop her divorce proceedings. She replied that they had tried reconciliation before and it ""wouldn't work."" When Meyer insisted, she said, ""It is out of my hands."" At this, he replied, ""I can do something about it, drew his revolver, and shot her. Delores started hitting Meyer with her hairbrush, but stopped when he turned the gun on her. Meyer did not hurt Delores, but did shoot his wife twice more before fleeing. Assistant prosecutor Phil Henderson said the idea that Meyer was struck first was a ""concocted story"". He asked the jury to feel Delores's broken hairbrush in their hands to judge whether it could've hurt Meyer. Prosecutor Fred Murray also said Meyer had a bad conduct record in the Navy and was defiant against authorities. Six months prior to the murder, he had been fined on a charge of assault and battery filed against his wife.

>""What did he think of them and his wife? The pattern is clear that Benjamin Meyer has no respect for law and order.""

Murray noted that Meyer had bought the gun on the day of the murder: ""Meyer proceeded in cold blood to take his wife's life, and shot twice more to make sure of it.""

Murray dismissed the claim that the gun was for suicide. In regard to a previous suicide attempt by Meyer a month prior to the murder, he described it as a half-hearted attempt intended to guilt-trip his wife into dropping her divorce proceedings and said that Meyer didn't have the guts to kill himself. He also said that Meyer's decision to flee and conceal the weapon indicated his awareness of what was happening. 

Meyer was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death after the jury declined to recommend mercy. He was the first person sentenced to death in Hocking County in the 20th century. However, on September 20, 1955, just three days before his scheduled execution, Governor Lausche commuted his sentence to life in prison after a campaign from his parents. Lausche had repeatedly delayed the execution as Meyer's parents pleaded with him to consider their son's circumstances. Lausche gave this explanation for his decision.

>""Through difficulties and misunderstandings in the home, they had been separated on several occasions. During the last separation, he visited wanting her to come back; a further misunderstanding occurred at the end of which he took her like through a gunshot. When they were married on Nov. 23, 1945, he was 16 years and nine months of age and she was 18 years and nine months. Within the first seven years of their marriage, five children were born. At the time of the tragedy, he was 24 years of age and already the father of five children. He was skilled in no trade or craft and started laboring in a factory when he was 16 years old. The task which fell upon him and his wife was extraordinarily heavy. Misunderstandings and bickerings were inevitably to occur. He was not equipped either by age or position of a trade or economic background to assume his huge responsibilities. With the full recognition of the seriousness of the crime and the sorrow he has brought upon the relatives of his deceased wife, in my opinion, the ends of justice will be served by the State of Ohio exacting of him imprisonment for life instead of death by execution.""

Meyer was paroled some time between the late-1970s and mid-1980s.

His younger friend would not be so lucky. Bernard Schreiber, 19, was executed by electrocution at the Ohio State Penitentiary in Columbus on March 15, 1956.

I'm a recent Washington State transplant and had bought a souvenir mug and shot glass with the pictured pattern to send to my parents back home. They broke a while back and I've searched at multiple Fred Meyers to try and find replacements, but it seems they might have been discontinued. Can anyone help me so I can finally send my parents some silly souvenirs? I loved this design so much and nothing else really hits like it does. (My parents don't care for our resident sasquatch of the woods, so I want to avoid getting anything with it on it.)

The mug was a bigger coffee mug (more wide than most) and had a red handle with a white body, and the same decals all over it. the shot glass was a frosted white with the decals all over it.

thank you for your help!!",1,1766008542.0,HelpMeFind,2,0.99,False

I only call put when I desperately need too which isn’t often, I have always been promoted in my jobs and have even won an employee of the quarter award at a previous job. Every job I have worked for I have moved up fairly quickly due to succeeding in my job, so why do none of my jobs care about me? I use to work at a pizza chain restaurant and became a manager and even was going to franchise but the company did something extremely shady towards me which resulted in me leaving because I had felt extremely disrespected. I got another job as a barista at a coffee stand and worked there for a couple of years moved up, won an award and had thoughts of becoming a manger for them. I hurt my back and was out of work for a week and used my sick time and after my week of being bed ridden due to this injury I had a meeting with my boss and he proceeded to call me unreliable because I had missed a week of work. So I found a new job and I have been with them for a year and the same things are happening. Being talked to disrespectfully, receiving back handed compliments, and just unnecessary remarks all together from higher up. I guess I just don’t understand why a company that has hard workers that are willing to go above and beyond for them truly don’t care about their employees. Is this just going to be life? Working hard for a boss or company that gets to be awful to me? Because if so I don’t know how much longer I can do it.",1,1766008442.0,venting,1,1.0,False

She got upset, said I was embarrassing her, and accused me of being cheap over “just brunch.” I stood my ground and the server ended up splitting the bill so she could use Apple Pay.
Now she’s barely talking to me and says I ruined the outing over money. Some friends say I should’ve just paid and dealt with it later.

Life’s been standing still for a while. I’ve been stuck in the same place, in academics, in my head, in cycles that feel endless. Change is hard, but lately, so is staying the same. The cuffing season has me wishing for emotional warmth.

I’m 26, based in Italy, and either I feel everything deeply or become numb. Maybe too deeply sometimes. I care about people, about fairness, about trying to make sense of a world that often feels indifferent. I’m not here pretending to have it all figured out. I’m here hoping to meet someone who’s also just trying, thoughtfully and sincerely.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, I have to take part in softening it. I believe kindness means showing up, not staying neutral. If you’re indifferent to injustice, we probably won’t connect. 

---

About me:

- 6ft | slim build | dark eyes | darker humor (especially after midnight)

- Emotionally literate and always trying. 

- Coffee, books, and quiet mornings are my comfort zone but I'm also a night owl.

- I like small forms of closeness.. shared music, late-night voice notes, quiet dinners, honest silences


Currently juggling work and studies. It’s chaotic, but I’m learning to find the small moments of calm inside the noise.

About you (hopefully):
You care about the world and the people in it.
You believe love is less about grand gestures and more about consistency. You’re introspective, emotionally aware, and not afraid of hard conversations or messy feelings.

Bonus points if:

- You find bookstores comforting

- You speak with honesty but lead with empathy

- You believe kindness and strength can coexist

- You value awareness over apathy


What I want:
Sincerity. 
Someone who shows up. Someone I can be soft with, who wants to build something grounded and real, even if it’s imperfect. Maybe we find peace in each other’s chaos, or maybe we just help each other breathe a little easier in the process.

>\~16k words total, CW: >!child abuse, non-graphic mentions of grooming and suicide!<

The dreams are back, with a vengeance. I chase my mother down an endless, darkened corridor. She never once looks back, even as I scream my throat hoarse calling for her. She disappears into doorways and feints around corners. Still, I pursue her, her hair floating behind her, just out of my grasp. She turns suddenly into a doorway I recognise. I don’t want to follow, but I do. In the silver gloom of the nursery, she stands over Ruthie’s crib, finally still, and I reach out to her for comfort. But when she faces me, she’s not Mum. She’s Anna. And from two black, eyeless holes, she weeps tears of blood. The rivulets cascade down her cheeks and drip off her chin, falling onto her chest. Her jumper is stained dark red at the nipples, the wetness spreading outwards.

Anna whispers something, barely audible. I ask her to repeat it, even as I realise what she’s said. This time, she screams it.

‘*What have you* done\*?\*’

I wake up, clammy and sweating. I can’t move, I just clutch the covers around me and try to calm down. My breath comes fast and shuddery, and I feel sick and scared and overheated.

Five days. Five days until Anna is back, and I can be gone from this house, and rid of Ruthie.

I spend the next hour typing, then deleting, multiple texts to Mum. Some are complete admissions of defeat; the ‘I told you so’ she so desperately craves. Some are bitter, ugly messages, blaming her for my dysfunction, my arrested development. Everything I’ve ever wanted to say, but have been too much of a coward. I’m still too much of a coward - those messages are deleted, too. Mostly, I draft excuses for why I want to come home. Looking after Ruthie has really made me appreciate our mother-daughter bond? She’ll see right through that. I need some time off? When I’ve only just started working. I can babysit for Tash? What, and deprive Mum of another little dolly to dress up? She’d never allow it, qualification or no qualification.

In the end, nothing gets sent. Mum must have been watching the typing notification bubble, because as soon as mine stops, hers pops up. I wait, but finally, hers stops too, and her green online status switches to grey. Our own little cold war. 

\-

It’s a good thing Ruthie isn’t a real baby. I can no longer take care of myself, let alone an infant. I spend the next couple of mornings psyching myself up to go downstairs and get ready for the day, before stumbling to the bathroom, then to the kitchen to cram a few handfuls of dry muesli into my mouth before going back to bed. By the third day, the muesli box has been moved to the side of the bed. I don’t go into the nursery. 

\-

Two nights before Anna returns, I dream of being a baby. I’m rocked in Mum’s arms while she sings to me; it’s a song I recognise from when I was little. She gazes down at me adoringly, but her expression turns sad. From there, her sadness turns to anguish, then to grief - her face contorting into a teary grimace. She plucks me away from the warmth of her chest, her arms outstretching as she plunges me into icy water. 

My eyes snap open. I’m back in my body. Worse for wear, but back, at least. I get out of bed, moving gingerly; my body aches from the lack of movement. It’s early; only just light out. Most people won’t even be on their way to work yet. I pick my jeans up from the floor and pull them on. I make my way down the stairs with painstaking effort, suddenly desperate for fresh air. In the time it takes to reach the front door, I miraculously remember to pick up the keys before I leave the house. Outside, I heave in huge lungfuls of fresh air, clearing out the stale from days cloistered in my depression nest. 

I find myself at the same cafe from my early adventure outside. I haven’t left the house since I was last here, and it’s obvious from my reflection in the cafe window. I use my nails to scrape my hair into an acceptable shape, and tuck my pyjama shirt into my jeans to make it look more intentional. I still look scruffy, but I can’t bring myself to care. Scruffy people are still allowed to buy coffee.

I trip over the lip of the threshold, stumbling slightly. From the barista’s expression, I can tell that she was watching my attempt to neaten up from inside. Hopefully, she doesn’t recognise me. 

It takes me three tries to order what I want. My tongue is clumsy in my mouth, and I jab my finger at the menu as I mumble out an order. The barista does her best to help, and eventually, she repeats something drinkable back to me. I nod, relieved to be at the end of this interaction. I don’t want to be in the house with the doll, but I feel so exposed out here, unable to hide my anxiety. 

‘...after?’

She’s saying something to me. 

‘What?’ I ask, blearily. *Pardon*, my mother’s voice corrects in my head.

‘How’s the baby you’ve been looking after?’ she repeats, clearly trying to keep her sidelong glances at me discreet as she heats the milk. 

‘Oh, the baby. Right.’

I should say something. Some bullshit about how often she’s been smiling, or holding her head up by herself. Something light, positive and casual.

‘She isn’t real.’ is what I end up blurting out. 

The barista stares at me, only pulled out of it when the milk starts to bubble over. 

‘What do you mean?’ she asks, an attempt at keeping her tone light as she wipes down the nozzle. 

‘The baby. She’s a doll. She isn’t real.’ I hadn’t expected to tell anyone. Not for a while. I thought this would be a funny story that I’d practice in the mirror two years from now before using it as an ice breaker at parties. *Did I ever tell you guys about the time I babysat a haunted doll*?

‘A doll?’ the barista parrots. 

‘Yeah. It’s a thing. People do it because they can’t have real babies. So I’m being paid to nanny a fake baby.’ I laugh then, too loudly and too brightly. A woman tucked behind a laptop in the corner glances over in annoyance.

‘Wow, that’s-’

‘How much do I owe you?’ I cut her off. I don’t know why I invited the conversation, but I’m eager to end it as soon as possible.

‘Oh. £4.50, please.’

I pull out a fiver and push it across the counter to her. ‘Keep the change.’

‘We can’t do that.’

‘As a tip.’

She squirms at my insistence. ‘That’s very generous, but we still need you to-’

‘Give me the change, then.’ 

She hands me a 50p coin, which I promptly deposit in the jar on the counter marked ‘TIPS :)’ 

I don’t give her time to thank me as I swipe the coffee off the counter and book it for the door. I don’t thank her, either. 

\-

I finally get a message back from Anna. *Sorry for the radio silence! It’s amazing here, and I’ve been so busy! I knew you’d keep it all under control. I’ll be back tomorrow :) Anna*

3 minutes later, there’s a follow-up.

*P.S: Hope Ruthie has been behaving. Give her a big kiss from me* *xxx*

Maybe all she needed was a break. Her ‘daughter’ is already an afterthought, and she’s not been gone two weeks. Will she realise that she’s been playing pretend when she comes back and is confronted with a plastic doll? 

As an experiment, I fire off the last of my backlog of Ruthie photos. On her back, her arms posed stiffly above her, as if reaching for something. Maybe it will be the final straw, the thing that finally snaps her out of her delusion. 

But, like the others, the photo just gets a heart react. 

\-

I’m so exhausted after two weeks of nightmares that it feels less tiring to just stay up. I watch episode after episode of Family Guy, the big band theme tune snapping me back to alertness every 20 minutes. I must sleep for a little bit, because I lay back to rest my eyes for a moment, then open them to a completely different episode. No dreams, though. As the sun starts to rise, I drag myself off the couch, and get to work on setting the house right. 

\-

Despite the lack of sleep, the cleaning job is surprisingly effective, especially as the time ticks closer to Anna’s arrival. I finish packing and cleaning up the evidence of the cleaning itself about 5 minutes after she’s due home. Thank God she’s not a prompt person. She’ll just have to deal with my slightly unkempt appearance.

She’s really not a prompt person; it’s been nearly two hours. I didn’t go for a shower, in case she came home halfway through, but I washed in the sink, put on clean clothes, and even had time to put makeup on. With a little squirt of Anna’s *Coco Mademoiselle*, I’m downright presentable. But where the hell is she? I’m starting to get paranoid that she’s never coming back. I can feel Ruthie’s presence from upstairs; weighing on me oppressively. I just want to be out of here. Going home will be no picnic, not with the current state of mine and Mum’s relationship, but at least I’ll be back in my own room. At least no more nightmares. And best of all, *no more Ruthie*.

I’m actually pacing the house by the time I hear the taxi pull up. Striding back and forth like a parent waiting for an unruly child. So this is how Mum felt. I pause when I hear the engine turn off, and my chest leaps when I finally hear the sweet sound of the key turning in the front door lock. I have the last minute idea to throw myself onto the sofa, so I look like I’ve been waiting patiently, and not like I’ve been doing circuits of her living room to keep myself from picking up my phone to scream at her to get the fuck home already. 

The door opens, and the awful silence is broken by the bustle and fuss of Anna and her suitcases.

‘I’m so sorry I’m late! We were delayed taking off, and then my 5G was playing up when we touched down, absolute nightmare!’ 

‘No problem at all.’ I reply, covering any annoyance I may feel with a huge, toothy smile. ‘Let me help you with those.’ I hurry to grab the suitcase she’s dragging behind her, and am dismayed to see *another* suitcase on the threshold. Who needs two suitcases and a cabin bag for a 13-day trip? I took less than that when I left home to live in a psych ward for 6 months. 

I shuffle both cases in, deciding that they can stay with Anna’s cabin luggage in the hallway. No way I’m lugging them up the stairs. I hold my breath, and follow Anna into the main house.

Anna takes in the room around her, approvingly.

‘It’s so clean in here! You really did a wonderful job.’

I heave a little sigh of relief that she hadn’t taken it as a comment on her cleanliness. The house is pretty chilly from the windows being open all morning, but it seems to have been worth it; even I have to admit that after 7 solid hours of cleaning and tidying, the place looks like a showroom. ‘I hope you don’t mind, I know how overwhelmed you were.’ 

Anna puffs out her cheeks and nods at me. *Tell me about it!* 

‘A little holiday has done me a world of good! And how was Ruthie, did she give you any trouble?’ 

‘None at all.’ I lie. ‘She was good as gold.’ 

‘Is she sleeping?’ Anna asks, glancing above our heads.

‘She went down about an hour ago.’ I worked out a backstory while I was cleaning the kitchen sink. ‘I’m sure she’ll be thrilled to see you, though!’

‘I really can’t thank you enough.’ Anna reaches into her handbag and pulls out a leather wallet. It looks designer, but it’s not like I can tell the real thing from a knockoff. She takes a moment to count out the amount, then hands me a bundle of bills. ‘What we agreed on, plus a little extra, to make up for my lateness! Honestly, you’ve been an absolute star!’ 

I try not to think about Ruthie’s vacant, plastic stare; those grasping, molded fingers.

‘Order a taxi home; I’ll pay for it. But right now, I need to go and see my baby.’ Anna grins at me, then heads for the staircase. 

I pull out my phone and open the Uber app. I wonder what will happen to Anna from here. Has her time away really cured her, or will she slip right back into whatever psychosis makes her believe she has a living baby daughter?

It’s not my problem anymore. I calculate the cost of the Uber. £15.90. Call it £16.

From upstairs, a scream echoes through the house.

\-

In the weeks that follow, people have all kinds of opinions on what happened. I’m called the next Lucy Letby, Myra Hindley; Ruthie is likened to James Bulger and Baby P. They interview people on the street and ask them what punishment I deserve. 

‘Everything she did to that poor child, and more!’ one woman tells a reporter, who nods in sage agreement. 

There are calls to bring back the death penalty, especially for me. I get letters; long descriptions of the torture random people want to inflict on me. I take it all in, numbly. 

When the police arrived, I expected them to walk into the nursery, realise the situation and break the news to Anna. She wasn’t real, she was never real. I expected them to tell me I did the right thing, or to ask if Anna seemed stable otherwise. 

They didn’t. 

They emerged from the nursery looking pale, the female officer holding her chest. She read me my rights with a shaky voice, while her partner called in a bus over the radio. *Make sure the coroner is suited up,* he said. *It’s a mess in there*. 

I was put into handcuffs and bundled into a police car. During the ride to the station, the female officer spoke to her partner in hushed tones about her own children. *I just can’t imagine anyone doing that to a baby.*

I don’t remember a whole lot about being processed, the interview. I tried to tell them that whatever they thought they saw in there, it wasn’t a real baby. But the interviewing officer was talking to me in that horrible, patronising tone they used to use on me in the residential home, and I just clammed up. I should have asked for a lawyer, probably, like they always do on TV. I didn’t. I think I was still trying to wrap my head around what they were telling me. 

Mum came to see me the next day, after my bail was set. She looked ridiculous in her sunglasses and trench coat, like she was undercover. It was all for nothing, anyway; when my identity was revealed to the public a week later, and my face plastered all over the papers, there wasn’t a disguise in the world that would deter the press. 

She didn’t say much during that visit. She was mostly there to tell me that she wouldn’t be paying my bail.

‘You know I love you no matter what, but I just can’t stand by you on this one.’ 

I knew the real reason; she couldn’t afford it. I didn’t press it. They’d showed me the crime scene photos towards the end of my interview. In the same pretty dress I’d put on Doll Ruthie, was the bloated, blue corpse of a human infant; waterlogged, oozing and mottled with bruises. I don’t know how. But I know I probably should never be allowed out of prison. 

 

\-

At the trial, I watch the friendly barista sob into her hands.

‘I should have realised something was wrong. I should have done something.’ She was kind to me. And in return, I pulled her into this horror show, traumatising her for life. 

They show CCTV footage from that same day. Even when they play the few seconds of clear movement from inside the pram over and over, I can’t believe it. I saw what I saw. But, the evidence keeps coming. Not that Ruthie was a real baby; that’s proved pretty easily. Anna may have been isolated in her big suburban house, but there’s still birth records, check-ups. They can even prove that she died in my ‘care’, from the date of death reported by the autopsy. The real damning evidence is that I’m insane. And there’s plenty of evidence of that. 

My own lawyer, Richard, brings in ex-workers from the unit. Most of them have moved on from care work, or even retired, but they’re all here to corroborate that I was, in fact, mental. 

I keep my eyes fixed on the table in front of me. Richard says it’s good optics - I look, at best, penitent, and at worst, confused. But mostly I can’t bear to see how people look at me. I’m not just crazy; I’m *evil*. A career baby-killer, now that I have two under my belt. I don’t think Tash has attended a single day of trial, and I can’t say I blame her. For all she knows, her baby could have been next. Hell, for all *I* know. 

\-

Mum’s dressed all in black like she’s come for my funeral, not my trial. I expected that she wouldn’t exactly be helpful as a character witness, but my lawyer explains later that she was perfect. Not only did she make her own case for my insanity, but he suggests that her demeanour on the stand may have convinced much of the court that mental illness runs in the family. I snort at that, the closest thing I’ve felt to laughter in a long time. It turns out that insisting you knew something was wrong with your daughter the entire time while testifying in the death of an infant, doesn’t ingratiate you to a jury. Richard quietly passes on something he overheard from a juror during recess:

*No wonder, with a mother like that.*

\-

I drift through the rest of the trial, only occasionally paying attention. There’s only so much you can hear about your own mental deficiency until it’s like, okay, we get it.

The jury get it, as well. Despite Anna’s lawyer fighting hard to paint me as some baby-hating, Machiavellian mastermind, it’s apparently clear to just about everyone that I’m simply not well. The psych assessments are barely necessary. Richard is thrilled when the jury come back with a unanimous verdict of Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity, but I can’t quite bring myself to share his enthusiasm about an indefinite psych hold. Maybe it seems like the better option to people who have never spent time on a ward. I almost wish they *would* bring back the death penalty for me. 

\-

Dr Kim is a kind-looking woman, with a soft-spoken voice. She doesn’t look at me like the others; like I’m a monster, like they’re contemplating stabbing me with the closest sharp object. Her office is properly decorated with calming artwork and gentle pastels - a nice change from the stark-white brutalism of the ward. I’m even allowed to sit in here without one of the ward nurses for security, as long as Dr Kim keeps the blinds on her office door open.

‘Good morning, Abby.’ she says, and I stretch my mouth into a polite smile. It’s nice to hear my nickname again, not ‘Abigail’ or ‘Miss Fletcher’ spat out by the other nurses and residents, or clinically spoken in full on the news reports when they ‘forget’ to turn them off at TV time. 

‘How are you feeling?’ she asks, which is nice to hear, too. 

‘Tired.’ I say. ‘They put me on sedatives most of the day, but they won’t let me sleep. When I do sleep, it’s just nightmares.’

Dr Kim’s face twists sympathetically, and she scribbles a few notes on a pad beside her, impressively managing to do it without more than a glance at the paper. ‘That must be hard. How do you feel about everything that’s happened?’

‘Confused, mostly. I thought I knew what I saw, but none of the photos line up with my memory. It all feels like some elaborate prank.’

Dr Kim nods thoughtfully. ‘That does sound confusing.’ 

Then, after a pause, ‘I wonder if I could introduce you to somebody.’

I wait while she gets up, reaching into a canvas bag that was waiting for me on her desk, and pulls out a bundle wrapped in a soft, white blanket. Shifting it into the crook of her elbow, she leans forward to offer it to me. I take the bundle, and loosen the wrapping with trembling hands. I gasp.

It’s a baby. A living, breathing baby, with a scrunchy face and tiny fingernails. I stroke the baby’s little cheek, and it’s so soft.

‘You look like you recognise baby. Can you tell me who it is?’

I can feel tears welling up in my eyes as a smile splits my face, the first genuine smile in a long time.

 Hi all!  I live in Philly, in an amazing little old one bedroom in a great neighborhood. I’ve been here for years now, and it has served me well in many ways. I enjoy feeling part of something, people watching, etc. Many parts of me feel alive in the city. However, many other parts of myself feel disconnected from nature and my spirituality living around so much concrete. 

My partner and I suddenly received an opportunity to move into our close friends house while they are away for the year. They live in an incredible house - old, one of a kind, with many cool details. The price for what we would be getting is amazing as well - only a few hundred more than my (no laundry and utilities not included) city apartment- with 2 acres of grass, fruit trees, an herb garden, sauna, cold plunge. However, the house itself is in a strange neighborhood. A bit sketchy in certain ways, overall safe I think, but not lively by any means. I really enjoy walking outside my door and going to get coffee etc, and that sort of thing is just not possible at the house. 

What I get in turn is a large house, closer connection to nature, a shared space with my partner, and an opportunity that does not happen often. (It’s much cheaper than anything I’m seeing online with the amount of space and land) 

What I lose is the end of my chapter living alone in a city, all the romance and convenience that comes with that. Important note is that I have strange and large grief about leaving the apartment early? I’d be breaking lease and visualized having until summer to slowly say goodbye. (I’m too dramatic and nostalgic for my own good) but it’s been almost half a decade and it’s held me through a lot, so leaving kind of abruptly feels scary  

I’m almost 30, but man I feel sad at the thought of the city chapter ending. But also… curious excitement at the thought of something new and more relaxing.

I’m curious what others think, and am open to advice. What would you do? Would a random suburb feel isolating? So much to think about, and the time is ticking! Thank you in advance",1,1766007578.0,SameGrassButGreener,0,1.0,False

Here’s a sample of what my longer replies can look like to give you an idea of what to expect. No pressure if you don’t have any samples 

———

Norna didn’t speak for while as she followed Lucifer she just couldn’t, she temporarily lost that ability for a bit she was so flustered. 
She looked over at the altar curiously,she couldn’t help but notice and love that it held some similarities to the ones she has for her own gods back home. With the fair linen that was spread neatly over it and a nice display of candles on it.She looked up at the perfect rows of endless pews in front of them in the chancel before slowly turning to look around entirely. Just marvelling over its old and meticulously detailed statues that surrounded them and the beautifully crafted stained glass that left a kaleidoscope of colour on the walls, illuminated by the sun. This place was unlike anything she had ever set foot in on Midgard,even she could sense an ethereal presence here that can’t be overlooked. How people who’ve never been to been to heaven managed to captured a glimpse of it from merely a book and passion is incredible. But it’s a great passion even she can relate towards her gods. It’s crazy and kinda sad that the list of similarities grew between the two practices yet they’re still worlds apart.When she finally faced Lucifer her face went bright red, her eyes again taking in his appearance.Blissfully bringing her back to reality, she smiled shyly, he’s just too gorgeous for his own good. While still giddy over the nickname at least she had enough time to find her voice again“It’s really pretty” she said, almost begrudgingly. She hated to say it, but it’s the truth, this place is truly breathtaking. The whole cathedral is an entire altar of art.

And here is my more shorter and common response.

————-

Tony laughed “Can’t tell you that! It’s supposed to be secret” he teased, the corners of his mouth curling with a mischievous charming smirk. If only Ava knew. He’s the furthest from working with the FEDS. He’s their worst nightmare. A phantom in a tailored suit, who basically has the city lassoed in a chain made of his threats and bloodstained promises. The kind of man whispered about in precincts, like a monster parents scare their kids straight with “So what’s new with you?” He asked, trying to steer the subject away from his work.

Hopefully these replies are okay with you.

These are my plot suggestions. Most of these are not set in stone what AU/time period they take place, we can tweak them however much you want I’m always open for new ideas. And we certainly do **NOT** have to do them if you don’t want they’re merely suggestions. If you have any of your own please share away

**Tempest**

Had we traveled towards Silk City knowing what was happening ahead, we might have been more cautious. Things were happening that we had no idea of.

In an office with a stone floor sat an ugly man. He looked down his nose at another man; this second man was dressed in the outfit of a guard.

Master Tenebris sneered and said, ""You used to work for me. Didn't I fire you?""

The guard said, ""Yes sir, Master Tenebris. But I'm not here about that. I have some information I think you would pay for.""

The third man in the room, Captain Severus, was a large man. Not large like Master Tenebris, but broad-shouldered, with arms like tree trunks. This man had worked for Master Tenebris for more than 20 years. The gray in his hair and beard only made him look more menacing. He had been the chief of guards for 10 years. He remembered the fool standing before Master Tenebris.

Master Tenebris looked bored and irritated. ""Well, how much?""

""I think... well you know, I think... Maybe two gold coins,"" the man stammered.

Master Tenebris, looking bored and even more irritated, said, ""Why don't you tell me the information, and if I decide it's worth two gold coins, I'll pay you.""

The man looked disappointed but continued. ""I saw a man. He attacked a shipment of slaves that we were bringing in for the slave block. He had your mark, your slaver mark. But the magic didn't seem to be affecting him.""

Master Tenebris sat up. ""Are you sure? No one has ever broken the magic. You must be mistaken, or drunk.""

""No, Master Tenebris, I swear. I worked for your mines as a guard for more than two years. I know that mark. It was definitely yours,"" the man said.

Master Tenebris thought for a minute, then nodded his head. Reaching into a drawer, he pulled out two gold coins and tossed them to the man. ""This information is definitely worth two gold coins. Captain Severus, why don't you take this man out for a drink?""

The man started to protest, but a sharp pain in his kidneys prevented him. Then a strong hand clamped over his mouth kept him from yelling out.

**Long Road**

We had made good time traveling to Silk City. We were in good spirits. We hadn't run into any more trouble. We called Sanctuary just outside the city and spent the night. The next day we left Sanctuary and began to walk toward the main road.

Silk City had a large gate and walls that encircled the entire city. As we approached the city gates, there were approximately 20 guards set up to ensure no one tried to enter the city without being checked. We got into line. When we approached the gate, a guard stopped us.

The gate guard asked, ""What's your business in Silk City?""

""We're here as visitors,"" I said, then added, ""We may look for work.""

The guard looked up for the first time. Seeing the five of us, he nearly fell out of his seat.

""Well, if you're looking for work, it looks like you five could be guards. We don't discriminate because you are a monster; sometimes monsters make the best guards,"" he said after regaining his composure.

""Well, thank you. Right now we have gold enough. We will keep your offer in mind,"" I said.

With that, he let us in. Silk City was a stark contrast from the kingdom of Prydia Solaris. As we traveled around, it became obvious that there were really two cities. You had the Silk City of the haves, and the Silk City of the have-nots.

**Cat's Claw Inn**

We found an inn, the Cat's Claw Inn, that had a sign stating they served monsters and humans.

Entering through the front doors, we were welcomed by a large dining area with wood tables and wood bench seats. There was also a bar at the back, and a cat-kin woman behind the bar. She looked up when we entered, her green eyes widening when she saw Nyla. She dipped her head in a show of respect as we approached.

""How may I help you?"" she said, then looking over our group, added, ""We have ale, wine, food, and of course rooms to rent.""

""How much for the rooms?"" Nyla asked.

The innkeeper explained they had bed slots, one copper each, but couldn't promise we would be together as it was first come, first serve. Then, looking us over, she said, ""I'm sure you'll want rooms. They're five coppers a room. I still have three rooms available.""

Nyla said, ""We'll take two rooms, next to one another if possible.""

""Of course. May I ask what brings you to Silk City? I don't think I've seen another cat-kin since I left Prydia Solaris,"" the keeper said.

We explained we were just visiting. I don't know if the innkeeper believed us, but she didn't pry. She showed us to the rooms after taking our dinner orders.

Here’s a sample of what my longer replies can look like to give you an idea of what to expect. No pressure if you don’t have any samples 

———

Norna didn’t speak for while as she followed Lucifer she just couldn’t, she temporarily lost that ability for a bit she was so flustered. 
She looked over at the altar curiously,she couldn’t help but notice and love that it held some similarities to the ones she has for her own gods back home. With the fair linen that was spread neatly over it and a nice display of candles on it.She looked up at the perfect rows of endless pews in front of them in the chancel before slowly turning to look around entirely. Just marvelling over its old and meticulously detailed statues that surrounded them and the beautifully crafted stained glass that left a kaleidoscope of colour on the walls, illuminated by the sun. This place was unlike anything she had ever set foot in on Midgard,even she could sense an ethereal presence here that can’t be overlooked. How people who’ve never been to been to heaven managed to captured a glimpse of it from merely a book and passion is incredible. But it’s a great passion even she can relate towards her gods. It’s crazy and kinda sad that the list of similarities grew between the two practices yet they’re still worlds apart.When she finally faced Lucifer her face went bright red, her eyes again taking in his appearance.Blissfully bringing her back to reality, she smiled shyly, he’s just too gorgeous for his own good. While still giddy over the nickname at least she had enough time to find her voice again“It’s really pretty” she said, almost begrudgingly. She hated to say it, but it’s the truth, this place is truly breathtaking. The whole cathedral is an entire altar of art.

And here is my more shorter and common response.

————-

Tony laughed “Can’t tell you that! It’s supposed to be secret” he teased, the corners of his mouth curling with a mischievous charming smirk. If only Ava knew. He’s the furthest from working with the FEDS. He’s their worst nightmare. A phantom in a tailored suit, who basically has the city lassoed in a chain made of his threats and bloodstained promises. The kind of man whispered about in precincts, like a monster parents scare their kids straight with “So what’s new with you?” He asked, trying to steer the subject away from his work.

Hopefully these replies are okay with you.

These are my plot suggestions. Most of these are not set in stone what AU/time period they take place, we can tweak them however much you want I’m always open for new ideas. And we certainly do **NOT** have to do them if you don’t want they’re merely suggestions. If you have any of your own please share away

My Jura E8 EB seems quite loud during the rinsing cycle. I had it checked by service — they opened it and said everything is fine and it doesn’t need a general service yet.

Bought in May 2025 (1400 coffees) , now at \~3,000 coffees. Cleaned and descaled regularly when prompted.

I’ve attached a video — does this sound normal to other E8 owners?

1pp8ugp,https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1pp8ugp/lenovo_legion_slim_5_my_honest_review/,Lenovo Legion Slim 5: My Honest Review,"When I was laptop shopping a year ago, I ran into a problem that I assume many of you have/will encounter when trying to pick the best laptop for you. Reviews on specific units were scarce, and those that did exist were either suspiciously positive or scathingly negative. It seems as though the only people that review laptops are either paid to do so, or only do it if they’ve had a horrible experience. So, here’s my review of the Legion Slim 5 that I bought a year ago, free of any sponsorship or significantly negative bias:

**Model - Legion Slim 5 14APH8 - Type 82Y5**

     - Total Price Paid: $1,378.05. 

     - Specs: 14.5” OLED screen, AMD Ryzen 9 processor, and NVIDIA RTX 4060 graphics card. 

     - Ports: On the back it has x2 standard USB ports, x1 HDMI port, and its charging port. On the left side it has x2 USB-C ports. On the right side it has and AUX port, the camera on/off toggle, and a standard SD port. 

     - Other Physical Features: It took me way too long to figure out that the power button also functions as a fingerprint scanner, so there’s that. The outer plastic shell is sturdy, but scratches do reveal a white under-paint layer that can look worse than if it was black under there. 


**Processor - AMD Ryzen™ 9 7940HS**

     - School & Work: At the time of purchase, I was simultaneously going to school full time as well as working full time job in online sales. The Ryzen 9 was fully capable of keeping up with my ADHD brain. It seamlessly handled dozens of open tabs, programs, YouTube videos, Excel spreadsheets, and AI “tools” all at once. Never saw sluggishness or lag no matter how rigorous the work. 

     - Gaming: The GPU excelled at running every game I played, modern or older. From Warcraft 3 to Battlefield 6, it easily kept the FPS where I wanted it to be without overheating. The only times I saw it bogged down was when I was downloading large files while playing an equipment heavy game (Borderlands 4 & Clair Obscure) simultaneously. 

     - Overall impression: Ryzen 9 exceeded expectations under moderate - heavy workloads. GPU temps have rarely gone above 75* C. 


**Graphics - NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 4060 8GB**

     - School & Work: Not sure who needs good graphics for either… I sure don’t. 

     - Gaming: This was my first experience gaming either a decent graphics card so my opinion here might be uninformed, but was genuinely blown away how clear and crisp images were in game with the 4060. With 2/3 games I played I was able to crank the textures to the top setting, with no noticeable drop in FPS. The other 1/3 of those games were the most demanding titles of recent gaming (Cyberpunk 2077, Black Myth: Wukong etc), and had noticeable FPS issues only the highest quality settings. Also, for the longest time I thought the Nvidia app that comes pre-installed was bloatware, but it actually helped a ton to automatically optimize certain games’ graphics settings. 

     - Overall Impressions: RTX 4060 exceeded expectations for most games on highest graphics quality settings. 


**Screen - 14.5"" OLED**

     - I’ve never owned any electronics with an OLED screen and to be honest I thought it was a gimmick before I owned this laptop. My opinion now is that OLED is the only way to go. The colors are much more vibrant, and the images feel more immersive. I’ve also accidentally put it through a couple decent drops that it shouldn’t have survived, and it didn’t crack or chip at all. 


**Final Opinion/TLDR**

Pros: 

- Reasonable price for a mid-tier gaming laptop. 

- Easily handles all school/work tasks I’ve had. 

- Great GPU and graphic performance with moderate-heavy gaming for long periods at a time. 

- Tanked a dozen or so drops, spilled coffee, and a husky. 

Cons: 

- Your typical Lenovo & HP bloatware that comes pre-installed. 

- Warranty options are kinda garbage.

- They put TINY amount of thermal paste where you need it most.

1pp8u0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1pp8u0n/human_space_orc_engineering/,Human Space Orc Engineering,"The Galactic Engineering Oversight Committee (GEOC) usually dealt with species that treated physics as a religion. The Vulsh, for instance, spent three decades perfecting a bolt before they dared to screw it into a hull. 

The Xylophs would refuse to launch a ship if the gravitational constant of the engine room deviated by 0.000001\%.

​Then came the humans.

​Lead Inspector Vree of the GEOC stood in the heart of the UES Unsinkable II (the name alone was a statistical nightmare). Beside him stood Chief Engineer ""Mac"" MacAllister, a man who smelled faintly of burnt ozone and cheap coffee.

​The report below occurred when the Unsinkable II was cornered by a Krolaxian Dreadnought. The humans were outgunned ten to one.

​""We can't outrun them at 100%,"" the Captain yelled over the comms. ""Mac! Give me everything!""

​""If we go to 200%, the core will melt!"" Vree screamed. ""The laws of physics dictate—""

​""Forget physics!"" Mac roared, throwing a literal toggle switch he had installed himself. ""I'm rerouting the life support power to the thrusters! We don't need to breathe for five minutes if we’re already dead!""

​Mac then did the unthinkable. He pulled out a ""Jerry-Rigged"" device—a bundle of wires, a discarded smartphone, and a magnet from the ship’s kitchen. He jammed it into the warp-drive interface.

​""What is that?!"" Vree shrieked.

​""It’s a signal booster!"" Mac grinned like a madman. ""I’m tricking the drive into thinking the universe is 15% smaller than it actually is! It’s called 'Ghetto-Rigging' a wormhole!""

​The ship didn't just move. It shuddered out of existence, skipping across the dimensions like a flat stone on a pond. They arrived at their destination three days before they had actually left.

​The Inspector’s Final Report: ""The Orcish Machine""
​Vree’s final report to the Galactic Oversight Committee was later framed in the Hall of Horrors:

​SUBJECT: HUMAN ENGINEERING

​Humans do not 'build' ships. They take a series of explosions and 'convince' them to move in a straight line.
• ​Their technology is held together by spite, caffeine, and a silver adhesive known as 'Duct Tape.'
• ​They treat 'Safety Ratings' as a personal insult.
• ​They have a concept called 'The MacGyver,' wherein a human can repair a fusion reactor using nothing but a fermented fruit-skin and a paperclip.
• ​WARNING: Never ask a human ""Can we make it go faster?"" They will say ""Yes,"" and you will spend the rest of the journey praying to gods you didn't even believe in until the moment the warp drive started smelling like 'Burnt Toast.'
• 
​Recommendation: Avoid their engine rooms. If you hear a human say ""Watch this,"" or ""Hold my beer,"" evacuate the star system immediately.",16,1766007326.0,humansarespaceorcs,3,1.0,False

The first few appointments I gave her a tip in the room away from the register. I assumed she kept it but, the third time I was in I saw her take it to the manager behind the register. I had read that these "" massage therapists"" do not receive their tips and it all goes to the owner. I do not know if that is true. I do not know how they are paid. I have no idea who owns the massage business. But I became leery about leaving a tip. I mean really - 70$ for a massage is alot of money for me. And I do not mind tipping - I am a good tipper all round. But I decided today not to tip the gal that gave me a message. I thought maybe I would take her a food gift card or coffee card. I get to the register to pay and the manager is checking me out. I put my money on the counter and he says loudly - "" Are you not going to leave her a tip?"" So I put a few dollars on the counter. He says loudly "" Is this all? Is this all you are going to leave her?"" Embarrassed I threw all my one dollar bills on the counter.  ( The place was full) - He turns and puts them in the cash register. So all the money for the service went into the same till. So am I wrong assuming these workers are not getting the tip? How are they divvying it out to them? I'm going again and I am not going to tip. I will take her a food gift card. If I get feed back from the guy I am going to have words with him.

1pp8t06,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pp8t06/short_but_intense_dating_situation_ended_abruptly/,Short but intense dating situation ended abruptly,"I dated someone briefly but intensely (a few weeks ago). What feels important to clarify is that I was actually trying to go slow at first. I wasn’t pushing for labels or rushing anything, and I was cautious emotionally.

He, however, was very reassuring, initiated most of the emotional depth. We had long conversations and vulnerability on both sides that made me relax and allow myself to connect more deeply.

He kept showing up, initiating contact, and deepening the bond. There were no mixed signals at the time and the intensity was mutual.

Then, in the middle of what had been a really good night he suddenly had a big conversation with me and shut down. Almost like a switch flipped. He said he wasn’t ready for a relationship (which I think would have been too early to define anyway), that he was liking me too much, but that he wasn’t in a good place with himself and couldn’t handle it.

After that conversation, the dynamic changed quickly. We still tried to make plans, like having a friendly coffee or something, because that night was chaotic and intense. There was intermittent distance and closeness, and eventually I sent a message that was kind but acknowledging I was tired of this rhythm of making plans/cancelling silence. I was always calm and respectful, since he did communicate with me, but I think I deserved more, even if just a coffee to talk, and now, silence. 

What’s confusing is that up until that exact moment of the conversation, everything felt warm, mutual, and real. And since then, while avoiding too much direct communication with me, he’s back to being active on dating apps.

I’m not trying to villainize him, maybe I should, I genuinely believe he’s emotionally overwhelmed and avoidant. But the abrupt cutoff after that level of intimacy hurt so deeply, I’m not ok at all. It left me questioning everything about human connection and love. Is this simply someone who can’t sustain closeness once it becomes real? He’s either really in a horrible place mentally or he is an absolute psychopath, as much as it hurts me to say this. 

I’ve moved on behaviourally, living my life, but emotionally this one hit so hard. I can tell you I hadn’t got a panic attack in years and I had one when I saw him on dating apps again. He broke me so much, even with kindness and communication, even liking me, how can this happen?

I’m half venting, half looking for perspective. Does this sound like avoidant shutdown? Have you even done this to someone on this level? Why?

1pp8sr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lenovo/comments/1pp8sr9/legion_slim_5_my_honest_review/,Legion Slim 5: My Honest Review,"When I was laptop shopping a year ago, I ran into a problem that I assume many of you have/will encounter when trying to pick the best laptop for you. Reviews on specific units were scarce, and those that did exist were either suspiciously positive or scathingly negative. It seems as though the only people that review laptops are either paid to do so, or only do it if they’ve had a horrible experience. So, here’s my review of the Legion Slim 5 that I bought a year ago, free of any sponsorship or significantly negative bias:

**Model - Legion Slim 5 14APH8 - Type 82Y5**

     - Total Price Paid: $1,378.05. 

     - Specs: 14.5” OLED screen, AMD Ryzen 9 processor, and NVIDIA RTX 4060 graphics card. 

     - Ports: On the back it has x2 standard USB ports, x1 HDMI port, and its charging port. On the left side it has x2 USB-C ports. On the right side it has and AUX port, the camera on/off toggle, and a standard SD port. 

     - Other Physical Features: It took me way too long to figure out that the power button also functions as a fingerprint scanner, so there’s that. The outer plastic shell is sturdy, but scratches do reveal a white under-paint layer that can look worse than if it was black under there. 


**Processor - AMD Ryzen™ 9 7940HS**

     - School & Work: At the time of purchase, I was simultaneously going to school full time as well as working full time job in online sales. The Ryzen 9 was fully capable of keeping up with my ADHD brain. It seamlessly handled dozens of open tabs, programs, YouTube videos, Excel spreadsheets, and AI “tools” all at once. Never saw sluggishness or lag no matter how rigorous the work. 

     - Gaming: The GPU excelled at running every game I played, modern or older. From Warcraft 3 to Battlefield 6, it easily kept the FPS where I wanted it to be without overheating. The only times I saw it bogged down was when I was downloading large files while playing an equipment heavy game (Borderlands 4 & Clair Obscure) simultaneously. 

     - Overall impression: Ryzen 9 exceeded expectations under moderate - heavy workloads. GPU temps have rarely gone above 75* C. 


**Graphics - NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 4060 8GB**

     - School & Work: Not sure who needs good graphics for either… I sure don’t. 

     - Gaming: This was my first experience gaming either a decent graphics card so my opinion here might be uninformed, but was genuinely blown away how clear and crisp images were in game with the 4060. With 2/3 games I played I was able to crank the textures to the top setting, with no noticeable drop in FPS. The other 1/3 of those games were the most demanding titles of recent gaming (Cyberpunk 2077, Black Myth: Wukong etc), and had noticeable FPS issues only the highest quality settings. Also, for the longest time I thought the Nvidia app that comes pre-installed was bloatware, but it actually helped a ton to automatically optimize certain games’ graphics settings. 

     - Overall Impressions: RTX 4060 exceeded expectations for most games on highest graphics quality settings. 


**Screen - 14.5"" OLED**

     - I’ve never owned any electronics with an OLED screen and to be honest I thought it was a gimmick before I owned this laptop. My opinion now is that OLED is the only way to go. The colors are much more vibrant, and the images feel more immersive. I’ve also accidentally put it through a couple decent drops that it shouldn’t have survived, and it didn’t crack or chip at all. 


**Final Opinion/TLDR**

Pros: 

- Reasonable price for a mid-tier gaming laptop. 

- Easily handles all school/work tasks I’ve had. 

- Great GPU and graphic performance with moderate-heavy gaming for long periods at a time. 

- Tanked a dozen or so drops, spilled coffee, and a husky. 

Cons: 

- Your typical Lenovo & HP bloatware that comes pre-installed. 

- Warranty options are kinda garbage.

- They put TINY amount of thermal paste where you need it most.

1pp8qyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pp8qyr/sf_the_cafe/,[SF] The Cafe,"The café smelled faintly of burnt sugar and wet pavement, the kind of scent that settled into your clothes without asking. She checked her phone again. 8:58 a.m.

Early. Always early.

Mara sat at a small table near the back, away from the espresso machine’s clatter. Her outfit was simple—white T-shirt tucked neatly into dark jeans—but the neatness felt like a shield more than a choice. Her Americano sat untouched beside her planner, steam rising in a thin, almost embarrassed curl.

She flipped the planner open, pretending to read the day’s schedule.  
9:00 AM: Meeting with self (Review Q3 intentions).

The words suddenly felt ridiculous. A meeting with yourself in public. No wonder her chest had that familiar tightness.

A burst of laughter from a nearby table made her flinch. She glanced toward the entrance again—8:59.

Why do I set times I know she won’t keep?

The bell above the door chimed, letting in a rush of cool air and a splash of color. Sol stepped inside like she owned the light around her. A suede dress in cobalt and pink, high-top sneakers, a nose stud catching the café glow—every part of her moved like she’d been born without the concept of embarrassment.

She spotted Mara and waved, weaving through the tables with that loose, effortless stride.

“You look so official right now,” Sol said as she slid into the chair opposite her.

“You’re late.” Mara kept her eyes on the planner. “Ten minutes.”

Sol dug through her tote for lip balm, unbothered. “Relax. I was appreciating the murals on the corner and hyping myself up about my outfit. That counts as productive.”

“It counts as unreliable,” Mara muttered. “We said we’d talk through a plan.”

Sol finally met her eyes, expression softening. “And maybe that’s why we’re here… so you stop trying to control every second like the world might fall apart if you loosen your grip for once.”

  

……….……

 

Sol drummed her fingers on the table, eyes flicking between Mara and the chalkboard menu behind the counter. Mara was already pulling her planner closer, flipping to a page filled with bullet points so dense they looked like static.

“Before we get into your… agenda,” Sol said, leaning forward, “have you eaten?”

Mara didn’t look up. “I had coffee.”

“That’s not food.”

“It’s efficient.”

Sol sighed, the dramatic kind—hands through her hair, eyes to the ceiling like she needed divine patience. “You can’t make life plans on an empty stomach. That’s how people end up having emotional breakdowns over spreadsheets.”

Mara blinked, defensive. “I don’t have breakdowns.”

“You had one last week because your socks didn’t match the ‘intended aesthetic.’”

“That was a moment of misalignment,” Mara muttered.

Sol pushed her chair back with a scrape, already standing. “Enough. I’m ordering for us.”

Mara’s spine straightened. “Sol, no—don’t. You always pick the most impractical—”

But Sol was already halfway to the counter, weaving through the café with her usual unhurried confidence. She pointed at something on the menu, nodded along to whatever the barista said, and gestured animatedly like she was narrating a story instead of ordering breakfast.

Mara watched from the table, jaw tight. Her fingers tapped an anxious rhythm on her planner.

We don’t have time for this. We need to focus. We need structure.

Sol returned a minute later with the claim slips, dropping into her chair like she was sliding into home base.

“Okay,” she said, placing one slip in front of Mara. “You’re getting the warm banana bread with salted butter and a proper breakfast latte. Because you need actual energy, not just caffeine-induced panic.”

Mara stared at the slip like it was a personal attack. “This is… excessive.”

“It’s food.”

“It has butter.”

“You will live.”

Sol placed her own slip down—some kind of neon-colored smoothie and an egg-and-avocado toast that looked like it belonged on a wellness influencer’s page.

Mara rubbed her temple, exasperated. “We’re supposed to be discussing the plan.”

“And we will,” Sol said calmly. “After you stop pretending you’re a robot who runs on dread and discipline.”

Her tone softened. She kicked Mara gently under the table.

“You’re allowed to be human, you know.”

Mara’s throat tightened just a little. “I don’t have time to be human.”

Sol raised an eyebrow. “Then it’s a good thing I do.”

“Arg, I’m not even hungry,” Mara muttered.

Sol didn’t blink. “I literally don’t care. You need energy. Especially with what we’re about to get into today.”

Mara opened her mouth to argue, closed it, then stabbed a piece of banana bread with more force than necessary. Sol watched her with this soft, satisfied calm, like she’d just rescued a stray cat that didn’t know it needed rescuing.

By the time the plates were empty, Mara had straightened her posture, wiped her mouth, and flipped open her planner again—her version of cracking knuckles before a fight.

“So,” she began, tone suddenly crisp, “you’ve failed. And now we need a game plan to come back and achieve higher.”

Sol groaned. “Wow, straight to violence.”

“I’m being realistic,” Mara continued. “I didn’t like how you handled things, but I’ll circle back to that later. For now—updates.” She took a breath, eyes brightening. “I’ve already applied to a few universities. And six jobs — three internships and graduate programmes, and three intermediate positions.”

Sol blinked, surprised. Mara leaned forward, smile cracking through her usual frost.

“You’ll be happy to hear this: two already emailed me back. Interviews. In three weeks.” She practically beamed. “Plenty of time to prepare, obviously.”

It was the first time Sol had seen her smile all morning. It almost made her forget how intense Mara was being… almost.

“Woah, woah, woah,” Sol said, holding up both hands. “Slow down.”

Mara’s smile faltered. “What now?”

Sol exhaled through her nose, eyes drifting down to her empty plate. “I haven’t even rested. Not properly. I don’t know if I’m ready to throw myself back into school after this year.” Her voice dropped, softer, rawer. “You know how close I was to losing it, right? I barely made it out.”

Mara didn’t say anything. The planner stayed open, but her fingers eased off the page. The café noise seemed to swell around them—steam wands, clinking cups, someone laughing too loudly near the window.

Sol pressed her palms flat against the table, grounding herself. “I need a second to breathe before you sign us up for a whole new life.”

Mara’s jaw tightened so fast it almost clicked. The moment Sol mentioned “rest,” something in her posture snapped rigid again.

“Rest?” Mara repeated, voice too sharp. “Rest from what? You sat at home for weeks doing nothing but overthinking and crying into cereal bowls. That’s not rest, Sol. That’s avoidance.”

Sol’s eyes narrowed. “Okay, you’re being nasty.”

“No, I’m being realistic.” Mara flipped a page in her planner—fast, frantic, more like a nervous tic. “We don’t have the luxury of *rest*. We have catching up to do. Fixing to do. Repairing the mess you let happen.”

Sol leaned back, stunned. “You’re acting like I tanked our entire life out of spite.”

“You kinda did!” Mara hissed. Her voice cracked mid-sentence, and that scared her more than anything. She swallowed, trying to steady herself. “Do you even know how hard it is to come back from a year like that? The gaps, the missed opportunities—people our age are ahead. They’re thriving. They’re stable.”

“That’s not fair,” Sol whispered. “I was drowning.”

“And now I’m drowning,” Mara shot back. “Because if you stop, I have to carry everything. The planning, the applying, the rebuilding. I’m terrified every day and you—” She broke off, breath stuttering. “You’re sitting here saying you’re tired.”

Sol’s face dropped, not offended now, just sad. “Mara… you’re spiraling.”

“No, I’m being *responsible*,” Mara snapped. But her leg was bouncing under the table, her breathing shallow. “If we don’t get it together, we’re going to fall behind for real. And if we fall behind—” She shut her eyes briefly, like the thought physically hurt. “I can’t handle another year like this. I can’t.”

Sol reached across the table slowly, as if approaching a skittish animal. “You’re not alone in this.”

“It feels like I am,” Mara said, barely above a whisper. “Every time you break, I’m the one who has to keep us moving.”

“And every time you push too hard,” Sol replied softly, “I’m the one who keeps us human.”

Mara’s eyes snapped open, irritation flaring again. “Don’t turn this into some poetic therapy line—”

“It’s not poetry,” Sol cut in. “It’s truth.”

Their eyes locked—two versions of the same soul arguing for dominance. The tension wasn’t just frustration; it was fear wearing different outfits.

Sol took a breath. “I know you’re scared. I am too. But we’re not rebuilding anything if you burn us out before we even start.”

Mara looked away quickly, blinking too fast.

“I’m not burning us out,” she muttered. “I’m trying to save us.”

1pp8pdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1pp8pdw/ldl_cholesterol_concern/,LDL cholesterol concern?,"Hi! I'm fairly new to keto, and I recently got bloodwork done. I saw a result that was mildly concerning. I'm getting mixed messages about whether this is a normal effect of the diet, or whether it is bad.

Some bg info: I've been on keto since April 2025, and I've lost about 15 lbs since then. I was 132 lbs in Dec 2024, 123 lbs in May, and right now I'm hovering around 108. I'm 4'11 and 21 years old. 

From May, My LDL went from 75 to 107, which was marked as high. My HDL went from 72 to 85, and my Triglycerides went from 44 to 35. Am I doing something wrong with my diet, or is this just a result of my body breaking down stored fats? For context, I know I've lost a lot of body fat because I can certainly tell that my arms and thighs are significantly skinnier, and I've typically never really lost fat on my legs until keto. For a few months straight, I was also most definitely in an accidental huge caloric deficit too (oops).

I try not to do dirty keto. I try my best to eat lots of vegetables, berries, fish, and chicken, and I try to avoid eating too much cheese (I used to eat more, but I've stopped over the past month or so.) I'm wondering if I should just cut out most forms of dairy besides maybe some plain yogurt or cream for my coffees, or stop frying foods with olive/avocado oils and butters and start baking/broiling instead?

I also don't usually have cheat days... If I do, it's still probably grainy foods with more fiber, like rice and beans. I don't typically eat junk food or fried fast foods. I don't typically reach the normal keto fat macros goal either, since I just can't force myself to eat that many fats or calories. I don't usually go over 40-60g a day.  But in general, I've been eating as healthy as I possibly can, probably healthier than I ever have in my life. So, is this LDL spike normal??

1pp8mn4,https://i.redd.it/7kicni970u7g1.jpeg,Poggio di Sotto Rosso di Montalcino - 2 Legit 2 Spit,"**2017 Poggio di Sotto Rosso di Montalcino**



Here’s a wine to try before you die.



You’ve probably heard it before:  “This is their less-expensive wine, but it is as good as the top wine at many other wineries.”  Oh word.  Can’t wait to spend eighty bucks on some winery’s editing room floor.



And, every so often, if you’re really fortunate, it will actually be true.  And here is just such an example.



I am an evangelist for Sangiovese.  It’s always considered a second tier grape but fuck that because it’s just not true.  



Poggio di Sotto’s Rosso di Montalcino is one of the greatest Sangioveses produced.  Even better, it’s more delicious and interesting and easy to appreciate than its more expensive Brunello brethren.  Even better than that, it’s a truly traditional example of Tuscan winemaking, utilizing large Slavonian oak which lets Sangiovese’s wide range of delicious accents show off without too much international oakage.   It tastes like an AUTHENTIC product of place.  People try to duplicate this taste elsewhere and fail every time.  That counts for a lot.  That's one of the best things about wine actually.



The flavors are so warm and beautifully melded.  Foggy, wispy mediterranean herbs with campsmoke and rose-tinged strawberries.  There’s a soft, leathery character, with cured pork fat and light roast coffee.  The flavors all course together in this gorgeous autumnal sensory whirlpool.  Goddamn is it delicious.  It makes me wanna stuff my face with porchetta.



Poggio di Sotto is located in the southern part of Montalcino, in Castelnuovo dell’Abate, and typically the Sangioveses here tend to be a bit riper than the northerly sited Montevertine and Monteraponi, but the wines have a similar feel of elegance, with maybe a bit of Cotes-du-Nuits richer mouthfeel in addition.   Their vineyards cover a range of altitudes so they can select grapes based on altitude when challenged with outlier vintages, like the warm 2017.  They work with 100% Sangiovese, with no other varieties planted.



I would say that for the money, I prefer to this every Brunello available in this price range.

1pp8l4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/1pp8l4l/two_months_of_testing_and_this_shift_is_actually/,two months of testing and this shift is actually working,"okay so i'm about 9 weeks into daily posting and still pretty stuck. been showing up every day, testing different styles, rewriting everything, trying new formats. still hovering around 280 views per video.

here's what i've been grinding on that clearly isn't working:

* tested 36+ different hook approaches this month
* bought three viral content mentors (waste of money)
* tried copying what bigger creators do
* spent nights studying what makes videos blow up
* switched my posting schedule hundreds of times thinking that was it

and nothing has changed. starting to think some people just understand this naturally and i don't.

but here's what i figured out in the past 9 days that's making a difference.

i went back through my last 26 videos frame by frame and tracked exactly where people were dropping. not vague timeframes but the precise second and what was happening right then.

found the same 3 patterns killing retention every time:

**my hooks are invisible.** i keep opening with ""this is crazy"" or ""wait for it"" type hooks. tracked it, 71% of people scroll within 2 seconds of these. but when i tested ""replaced coffee with green tea and had a migraine for 5 days straight"" it kept 70% through second 5. being specific works.

**second 5-7 is where everyone leaves.** thought holding attention for 3 seconds was enough. nope. i'm keeping people initially, then losing them because i'm not showing the payoff fast enough. been building anticipation when i should be delivering value.

**any pause over 1 second kills me.** what feels like letting the video breathe reads as dead air to someone scrolling. started cutting everything tighter. midpoint retention went from 50% to 68%.

so being real, i've been using TіkАlуzer for about a week to track all of this. it shows the exact second people drop and explains why. regular analytics just show when people leave but this breaks down what caused it.

like it'll say ""42% dropped at second 8 because hook was too vague"" or ""lost 45% at second 12 from 1.6 second silence."" stopped guessing and started fixing actual problems.

posted 6 videos since making these changes. what happened:

* video 1: 3.8k views (previous average was 280)
* video 2: 2.9k views
* video 3: 5.7k views
* video 4: 4.3k views
* video 5: 3.6k views
* video 6: 6.1k views

not huge numbers but it's the first consistent movement i've seen in 6 weeks. and i know what's working now instead of just hoping something hits.

dropping this here because if you're stuck where i was 9 days ago (posting daily, low views, completely lost), this might be what you're missing. not saying i've figured everything out, but this is the first thing that's changed my numbers.

I was did not deal with the asking for space well during the relationship but was able to get though those periods of time. It has now been about 4 months and a lot has changed over the last year. I believe that we would both be in a better place. I could tell my ex had worked on betting more securely attached and I am for the most part also pretty secure but weak at times. I am much more aware of my anxious attachment. I do not know if we would still trigger each other but think we should discuss it now that time has passed. I would need to ask for certain things before actually being in a relationship again but really miss this person because I do not feel like it was a fair shot at the time. 



I am so sorry. I am sorry for the things I did and said. I was unable to show up the way I really wanted to in the relationship. With all of the stress from work and my house. My ADHD and time blindness. I have been trying to work on this for a long time and it never was a reflection on how much I loved you. I know you felt like it was disrespectful and I am so sorry about that. I can and want to show up and be more consistent. I said things that I think were my ADHD being impulsive and were extremely dumb. I deeply regret talking about your hair color. It is something that I have reflected on and have some theories why I might have said that but are my own insecurities that are not about how much I love you and your style. I love your hair and think you are so attractive with your natural hair color. The fact that I would lose interest because of your natural hair is so unfathomable. I want to grow old with you. From the moon and back I would do just about anything to make you happy and feel supported. I do not want you to teach me how to be in a serious relationship. I want to work with you to show up and support each other in the best way possible. I think that some of these changes that I have made in my life would allow me to be more present and show up as a stronger partner. I loved being a queer couple with you and think we were so cute together.

I remember when we first started spending a lot of time together and you said something along the lines of this is what I have been wanting, this has struck me. I wish that I had asked what you meant but I believe that I want the same thing as you. I want a partner. A lover who has similar interests and goals. I want to have a family some day. I hope that going back to school will help to have a more stable job and life and future family. I plan to move to TOWN for school. I am almost done with my house renovation. It has taken a lot longer than I had hopped but I hope to rent it out for now while I focus on school. I also need some space from it. I have felt so isolated living up in TOWN. As you might remember I have been going to therapy but realized this was not enough. I am seeing a psychiatrist now and getting medication for my ADHD and anxiety.

I believe one of our biggest hurdles that strained our relationship was how fast we moved at the beginning. I think that the space between us with you having to take a train and me having to drive down to TOWN limited our ability to connect. We were both going through a lot. You had just moved back to TOWN, dealing with family and multiple immune and health issues. I was at a job that I really did not want and was sucking the soul out of me and making me very depressed. I had a house that I was hoping to renovate years ago but had no money and family conflicts that make it take much longer. I was not ready for a relationship. I knew that but we moved so fast and I fell so hard for you. The type of relationship was what I wanted so badly for so long I tried to hold myself together and be the best I could but it wasn't enough. As I have said before you were the only one who I felt comfortable allowing into my house in the chaos that I lived in. I was no small feat.

I love you. I love your music taste. It was my first connection to you, seeing that cutie at PLACE share her music and make such a danceable party. I love how big of a heart you have. Working with you on PROJECT was the first time we really connected and I love how it is such a passion of yours. Now working with kids it is really special. We have that in common. I love your art and how much of a passion of yours.

I don't know if any of this would change how you feel and if you would be willing to talk and try to reconnect sometime. I have been hurting so deeply for the last several months and wish I could have been better. I understand if you need more time, or if your feelings have changed. I am sending this because I wanted to take accountability and let you know where I am at. If you are ever open to grabbing coffee or a phone call to reconnect, I would love that. If not, I truly wish you the best.",2,1766006706.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1. Overall Strategies were wrong:

a. ""Vision"" of made in America was political and not practical.  Austin no doubt got caught up in the political slogan fever in the early days of ""bring back manufacturing"", in 1st Trump term, when tariff was eagerly thrown around.  But early signs were there that tariffs were not working, and those who invested too early in ""bring back manufacturing"" were just throwing money away.  Luminar sunk in time and money into manufacturing facilities, and worst of all, buying up component suppliers in US who were not profitable to start with, all in the hopes of some ""low tariff US LiDAR supply line"".  

90% of laser components (civilian grade) are made in China.  LAZR bought photonics company to secure supply chain?!  If that photonics company in US couldn't compete, what's the point of buying it?  Did Austin think he knew something the photonics company didn't?  How much money was wasted in that pointless exercise?

Unfortunately, the customers in US were not as committed to LiDAR.  By comparison, Chinese car companies wanted LiDARs, but they didn't want the expensive Luminar LiDARs.

Later on, Luminar tried to switch some manufacturing to China, but it was too late.  Competitions had already gobbled up the customers in China.

b. ""Premium"" LiDAR marketing is a joke.

It's a sensor, It's NOT coffee or wine.  Even if your tech spec is slightly better than the competitions, but you are more expensive, do the customers care?!  It turns out, mostly NO.

Even the military doesn't need this kind of ""Premium"" LiDAR.  Military might need some ULTRA grade LiDARs that have really long range and accuracy, but Luminar LiDARs don't meet those specs.

Also, LiDAR sensors are just ""components"" that always always become commoditized over time.  Since you are not selling to end users directly, your customers /car companies will always demand that you lower your prices.

You end up like any other ""commodity"".  So the whole model of trying to charge ""premium"" is just ridiculous.

c. Too much PR, not enough delivery.

LAZR is not a PR company.  It doesn't get paid for making PR for LiDARs.  It gets paid for units made, sold, shipped.

""Sales"" looked good, production lagged behind.

Last 3 years, LAZR made and shipped around 4000-5000 units per quarter, and significant number of those units were returned as defective.  (LAZR wrote off those ""inventories"" as losses).

These numbers didn't improve much at all.  costs were not lowered, profit margin was continuously negative.

By comparison, Chinese LiDAR companies were shipping over 200K - 1 million units per year.  Even US competitor Ouster was shipping around 10K units per quarter.

Cash burn on PR was ridiculously high

Too much PR became more like a Theranos style hype.  Overpromised, under delivered.",1,1766006243.0,LAZR_restructuring,0,1.0,False

Can ya'll see street signs more than 20 feet away? Menus behind counters (think fast food, coffee places, etc)? Faces when you're further than maybe 25 feet away?

I'm trying to find out if I just need to nuke my prescription and start over or if I need a new doctor. I'm 29, I get prisms in both lenses, currently have progressive lenses, and I'm -4.5 d in my bad eye and around -3.5 d in the good one. The most recent time I got new glasses we took out the correction for my mild astigmatism (I can't remember why).

 I have to have my boyfriend tell me what menus say, I can not drive without Google maps or knowing the area well because I can't see street signs until I'm too close to do anything about it. I've been going to my doctor for years and we tweak and tweak and tweak but it never actually fixes it. I can see things mostly fine, I just can't read anything that isn't either huge font or within a couple of feet of my face.

So, am I expecting too much out of the prescription or is this not a common occurrence?

1pp8cxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1pp8cxf/boyfriend_reconnecting_with_someone_from_his_past/,Boyfriend reconnecting with someone from his past and I don’t feel emotionally safe — am I overreacting?,"Hi everyone, I’d really appreciate some outside perspective because I feel stuck between trusting my instincts and not wanting to overreact.



I (F, 20s) am in a relationship with my boyfriend (M, 30s). Recently, he reconnected with women from his past. About 10 years ago, he, one woman, and another woman survived a serious accident together. There’s shared trauma there, and over the years they’ve occasionally had a group chat where they refer to each other as “survivors,” etc. The last time they were in contact was over 7-8 years ago.



There’s an important detail though: after the accident, while drunk, my boyfriend tried to have sex with one of these women when she didn’t want to. She was crying and he stopped, but he still feels a lot of guilt about it and says he wants to take accountability and find closure.



Last Sunday, he told me he had received a message from the group and that they had briefly reconnected. What he didn’t mention is that they are planning to meet this Saturday. I know this because I saw it on his Facebook. The plan is for him, the woman he tried to have sex with, and the other survivor to meet at the women in question's place, with a fire.



This is where my dilemma comes in.



I understand that he wants to close this chapter. However, he also sent a private message only to the woman involved, inviting her for coffee and saying they have a spiritual connection. To me, it felt less like closure and more like reopening something. He didn’t tell me about this message. When he spoke to me on Sunday, he framed it as wanting to apologize, and I assumed that would happen over a phone call or something similar.



I love him, and it’s important to me that he feels at peace, so I’m not trying to forbid him from doing anything. But the setting and the emotional tone are what make me deeply uncomfortable.



On one hand, I could bring it up today and ask directly about the meetup. On the other hand, part of me feels like he should be the one telling me, especially given the history and the private setting. 

There’s also a part of me that wants to wait and see:



* Does he bring it up on his own?
* Does he give more details voluntarily?
* Does he show awareness of how this might affect me?



If I wait until Saturday, I’ll evaluate how he gets ready, what he wears, and whether he seems more intentional than usual, and to be honest I am a bit curious about this. 



For more context, this situation isn’t happening in a vacuum. I’ve often felt insecure in this relationship around other women. For example:



* 3–4 exes have reached out to him during our relationship (he did tell me, but it still makes me wonder how many women from his past I’m expected to deal with).
* He looks at other women while we’re out together.
* Sending memes to his most recent ex when I came to visit him for the first time (we were in a LDR)



I’m trying to decide whether to speak up now, or whether the way he handles this without prompting already gives me my answer. If he goes to this meetup, I’m honestly thinking about breaking up — not as manipulation, but because I don’t want to live in a constant state of anxiety. This level of emotional vulnerability feels like something that should be reserved for a partner. I believe in having friends, but this feels more like a separate emotional life. I’m also fairly sure I’ll never be introduced to these women or have them integrated into his life.



I’m also pregnant, and this situation makes me feel incredibly unsafe. I’m currently considering both abortion and ending the relationship.



I feel like he is honest — but honesty alone doesn’t feel like enough anymore.",1,1766006191.0,relationships_advice,0,1.0,False

1pp8ahj,https://i.redd.it/y4ehcmm0yt7g1.png,Amazing Chatbot Sandwich Shops,"East Bend News - And unusual trend that’s catching on are coffee and sandwich shops where each menu item is a surprise tailored to the tastes of each customer. The menu at LLManwich Shop shop seems absurdly simple, with entries like “sub sandwich” or “burger, side and a drink”, but tweens and teens are loving it. 

How this is made to work is by a technique called “AI scraping” where where the patron allows a chatbot access to their social media, emails, and even their employment and health records. From there it not only determines what your likes and dislikes are, but even what your mood is, anticipating what type of meal you want, as well as the size, while targeting a comfortable dollar range for you.

Freddy Hudbucket, between taking hearty bites of his cuddle fish, peanut butter and olive sandwich, gave EBN the low-down on the experience. “I never really knew I’d like this combo, but somehow the bot just knows stuff. Every time I come here, it’s a surprise. Last week I got pepperoni, mealworm and pesto. Who would have known that by going through my emails back and forth with my dying sister that it could have determined this? And the pepperoni was low fat and low salt, taking my blood pressure issues into account.”

When asked if he had any privacy concerns Hudbucket replied, “Oh there’s a 379 page privacy agreement. I mean, I only skimmed it, but from what the corporate website says, it’s all kept in a local database right here at the sandwich shop and I can opt out any time.”

Johnny Startfisk, the shop owner explained the popularity of it this way. AI doesn’t really have a sense of taste or smell, and has no reference point for the experience of eating. This leaves it unfettered to make decisions free of any personal taste or bias. So when someone comes in, they know they are going to get something uniquely tailored to them each time, like that sweet potato, pimento ranch wrap I had for breakfast. 

When asked if he thought this was a passing fad, or here to stay he replied, “It’s such a liberating experience to let it just make arbitrary choices for you. I think letting AI take the driver’s seat and making all the decisions is the wave of the future.”",3,1766006026.0,lies,0,1.0,False

1pp88r7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1pp88r7/econ_agriindustrial_investments/,[ECON] Agri-industrial investments.,"The Agricultural Processing & Food-Industry Complexes Act (APFIC) creates a national framework to shift Brazilian agriculture from its primary role as a supplier of raw commodities to a diversified, technology-intensive agro-industrial system that can support sustained economic growth, stable foreign-exchange earnings, and greater social inclusion. The Act acknowledges that mere agricultural abundance does not drive development unless it is deliberately linked to industry, logistics, finance, research, and overall national planning.

Brazil’s agricultural sector has enormous productive capacity, but its longstanding reliance on exports of unprocessed commodities has left producers and the broader economy vulnerable to price fluctuations, currency instability, and limited capture of value added. APFIC tackles these structural vulnerabilities by restructuring agricultural production around regionally based processing capabilities, industrial interconnections, and unified national markets.

---

I. Establishment of Regional Agro-Industrial Complexes (CAIs)

The heart of APFIC lies in the creation of Regional Agro-Industrial Complexes (Complexos Agro-Industriais — CAIs), sited close to key agricultural areas. These complexes are built to take in regional production effectively, shortening transport distances, cutting post-harvest losses, and steadying farmers’ incomes.

Each CAI is conceived as a fully integrated production hub, not merely an isolated plant. It incorporates primary and secondary processing units, cold-storage and refrigeration facilities, grain silos, packaging and labeling operations, quality-control labs, maintenance shops, logistics areas, and worker accommodation. Essential public infrastructurez electricity, water, sanitation, and transportation connections, is developed at the same time to prevent bottlenecks and avoid upward pressure on costs.

The CAIs are placed across varied regions—including São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, Goiás, Mato Grosso, the Northeast sugarcane belt, and certain Amazon frontier zones—to promote balanced regional development and avoid over-concentration.

---

II. Priority Agro-Industrial Sectors

APFIC focuses on agro-industrial sectors that can quickly deliver productivity improvements, reliable domestic supplies, and export revenues. These include:

• Coffee roasting, grinding, and instant coffee manufacturing, enabling Brazil to export finished consumer goods instead of raw beans.
• Sugar refining and ethanol-based derivatives, linking energy, chemical, and food sectors.
• Dairy processing, covering powdered milk, cheese, butter, and fermented products.
• Meatpacking, cold storage, and processed meat production, backed by veterinary and sanitary facilities.
• Grain milling and derivative food-grain products.
• Vegetable oil extraction and oilseed processing.
• Canned, preserved, and dehydrated foods for export markets and strategic stockpiles.
• Animal feed manufacturing, boosting livestock efficiency.

Each CAI is organized to take in local farm output through long-term supply contracts, lowering risk for producers and ensuring consistent volumes for processors.

---

III. Financing, Industrial Linkages, and Domestic Content

Financing under APFIC is mainly coordinated by BNDE, Banco do Brasil, and regional development banks. Loan approval requires compliance with domestic content rules, mandating the use of Brazilian-produced machinery, steel structures, refrigeration systems, packaging materials, and vehicles wherever practical.

This approach forges robust backward linkages to the capital-goods industry, steel production, plastics, chemicals, paper, and mechanical engineering, amplifying the developmental effects of every investment. Import substitution emerges naturally from market demand rather than from bureaucratic bans.

---

IV. Cooperative Ownership and Rural Income Stabilization

APFIC strongly encourages cooperative and mixed and private ownership structures. Farmers, producer groups, and rural cooperatives are incentivized to acquire equity in processing plants, aligning interests between farming and industry. This model steadies rural incomes, builds political support, and lowers opposition to modernization, and bolsters the private sector.

Guaranteed purchase commitments and minimum-volume contracts shield producers from market volatility while encouraging higher quality and output. Rural credit, extension services, and mechanization initiatives are aligned with the rollout of CAIs.

---

V. National Food Quality and Standardization System

To serve both domestic needs and exports, APFIC sets up a National Food Quality and Standardization System. Federal laboratories and inspection bodies unify sanitary standards, nutritional labeling, packaging requirements, and export certifications.

This framework delivers consistent quality across the country, lowers rejection rates abroad, and enhances Brazil’s image as a dependable source of processed foods. Standardization also promotes price stability and consumer trust at home.

---

VI. Transport, Cold-Chain, and Market Integration

Logistics integration forms a core element of APFIC. CAIs are linked directly to railways, river ports, highways, and coastal shipping routes, facilitating smooth movement from field to factory to export point.

A national cold-chain expansion initiative supports perishables, cutting waste, steadying food availability, and allowing continuous production throughout the year. Storage facilities are increased to build strategic reserves, dampening seasonal price surges and inflationary forces.

---

VII. Macroeconomy impact.

In addition to industrial expansion, APFIC provides substantial macroeconomic stabilization. By increasing food availability and streamlining distribution, it curbs food-price inflation. By boosting rural incomes and jobs, it slows uncontrolled urban migration and relieves strain on city infrastructure.

Diversifying exports with processed foods yields more predictable foreign-exchange income without requiring additional land clearance or environmental damage. Agriculture shifts from an extractive activity to a fully integrated industrial component, bolstering national self-reliance and economic resilience.

At this point, only my two closest friends, my husband, and my therapist know. 

Does anyone else struggle with going back and forth between feeling elated about their gender identity and feeling like an imposter? It happens to me so often that I am sometimes wondering if I am even nonbinary at all. I tried a new name that I love at a coffee shop and it made me feel like I was lying? I was cringing when the name was called out. But I love that name. I’ve always disliked giving my actual name, and it has never felt like \*mine\* bc of its connections to my family (it’s a matchy matchy name with my mother). I thought I would be excited to approach the subject of changing it and being called something else, but instead I just felt fake and like an imposter. 

I hate that I’m not super androgynous. But then I also know people who are nonbinary do not owe anybody androgyny. It feels true for everyone else and I would fight this point to death for someone else, but it feels almost not true for me, or that it’s difficult for me to accept it.

Majestic Princess is a beautiful ship, especially decorated for Christmas. The itinerary delivered, especially with long days in Curacao & Aruba. However, onboard execution, particularly in the food & beverage department, fell below the high Princess standards we’ve experienced in the past.

# Highs

\- Ship is visually impressive and felt festive with holiday décor.

\- Observation area (17 forward,) was a treat, though I understand this will be converted to the exclusive ($$$) Sanctuary.

\- Excellent room steward; medical team also stood out.

\- Wakeview Bar was a consistent bright spot for service.

\- Fantastic Journey was a strong theater production.

\- Buffet food variety and quality improved compared to our last sailing.

# Lows

**Food & Beverage**

\- Specialty dining has lost much of its magic. Crown Grill, Sabatini’s, and O’Malley’s no longer feel like must-do experiences in both food quality and service. 

\- In the food venues, pacing was off and attention to detail was lacking. (No salt in Crown Grill, bitter coffee in IC, dry beef in Sabatini's, apps & mains coming together in MDR.) 

\- Food quality ranged from acceptable to great, but was rarely outstanding. Tea was a rushed affair with annoyed staff.

\- The Gelato parlor has been converted into a third Effy onboard. 

**Service**

\- Across dining and bars, service often felt reactive rather than attentive. Princess is steering passengers into self-service mode in all bars, now. Wait staff exist, but are stretched thin. Standing in long lines rather than sitting and chatting while being served is now the norm. 

\- Small details Princess used to excel at, like consistent glassware/flatware, pacing & presentation were frequently missed. (Example: our soup arrived in different tureens at Crown Grill.)

**App & Logistics**

\- The Princess app was clunky and unreliable compared to previous sailings, complicating reservations and onboard planning.

\- There are now commercials during the previously informative Wake Show, making it unwatchable after a couple of days.

\- Bits of Lotus Spa appointment slips were flying everywhere, found in corners and flying off the ship.

\- Disembarkation was disorganized and frustrating, with poor communication and crowd control.

# Final Take

Princess appears to be cutting into the very service polish and specialty-dining excellence that once differentiated the line. Expectations should be adjusted accordingly. The only place to get gelato (a Princess standard,) has been replaced by a ***third*** Effy space. It's a monument to the priorities.",9,1766005639.0,PrincessCruises,0,1.0,False

Her name is Bandit, she's a rescue, and she's been my best friend since we first met.  My wife and I were at a reptile expo just looking around, drinking coffee, and enjoying a day out without the kids (please don't judge us we had no idea how bad these expos actually are for the animals).

We came to this area in the expo that had lots of different small animals and as we walked up to this one table a little brown rat looked like she was escaping.  So I scooped her up and brought her to the table owner.  She had many elderly and rescue rats for adoption.  I told her one of her rats was getting away and it probably wasn't safe for her, considering where we were.  The lady said this one in particular is an escape artist and she was having trouble keeping her in the pin with the others.

Anyway, we pretty much immediately fell in love with Bandit and honestly I couldn't even think about putting her back with the others afraid she might get lost or worse.  So we decided to adopt and the lady told us we couldn't adopt just one, they do better in trios.  It was our first time owning rats so we just said hey more the merrier.

She's been the sweetest girl and I feel so privileged to have gotten to know how sweet and loving rats are.  I've honestly never known an animal with such emotional capacity.

Today, she's not doing well and I'm afraid we are close to the end of our road together.  She's the last of our original three and we adopted one more along the way.  So now I'm afraid Fievel will be lonely.  We have looked for rat rescues in our area with no luck.

Anyway, if you have any ideas how to make her last bit of time better let me know.  I'm afraid to pick her up but I wish I could hold her.  Even though it hurts like crazy I'm so thankful to have been in her life.

I was able to make it to the meeting in short order, though I chalked it up to my mind wandering away at what Edward had said earlier. How could he have gone and done something like that? First get into a fight and then not taking the injured to the medical centre.

He should have went straight to another crew mate or an officer, he could have at least told me and I’d say to the administration what was happening, but he said that the Jaslip would rather die than get medical treatment.

I shook my head in exasperation at what he had gotten himself into, and now with me and Cruth not saying to anyone, just why was I doing this? He most definitely owed me for this one, but if it blew up into a big thing then…

I didn’t want to entertain the idea, so I focused on what he would owe me now that I was helping.

*‘Maybe indefinite cuddles for life, or maybe I get to hug or pet him whenever I want to, maybe even groom his hair for him.’*

I trilled at the stuff we could do together my face heating up a little as the thoughts went on.

“Hey, watch it.” Another overseer said after I walked into the back of him, I offered a sorry before we shuffled into the meeting room.

Finding my seat, I saw a few of the other overseers weren’t pleased to be here again so soon, but what else stood out was the three pink avians now in the room. Captain Wellick was flanked by two other Reskets, one had bandages around their head, covering an eye.

Remembering what Edward told me I immediately had a sinking feeling knowing where this was going.

The Captain was talking to one of the administration staffers, from the few words I could gleam, they were furious. The Resket with the bandages though was swaying using the arm rest of his seat to steady themselves, looking closer they seemed dazed out of their mind from either the force Edward used or maybe the drugs they were under.

The last of the Overseers filed into the room, some holding cups of coffee grumbling that it’s far too early for this and others just not wanting to be here.

“Alright, this is everyone? Good.” The administration staffer cleared their throat before speaking again.

“Last night there was an attack on two security officers in Sector F, the assailant has left one of them wounded as you can see.” He gestured to the two behind him. “From what they have told me, it was a human and a Jaslip who attacked them. Furthermore, the Jaslip was reported being a member of the Jaslip independence Brigade.”

Shocked murmurs woke up the few overseers still half sleeping at the news, I internally cursed at Edward for what he’s got himself into. The Captain stood speaking with a commanding voice over the murmurs.

“Two of my officers were assaulted by a terrorist and a sympathiser, I want every report possible from you lot now. I want names of possible humans that could be harbouring the Jaslip or somehow smuggled them on board. Administration staff and my own security officers have been alerted to sweep sector F for the culprits.” He finished speaking and I could see that he was holding back barely contained rage.

Edward wasn’t a sympathiser; he never showed any inclination to wanting to help the Independence movement. I was getting worried now and I shuffled uncomfortably in the room becoming very aware of the cameras and other overseers in the room.

Another Overseer spoke after raising a hand “Um, what about the security cameras, couldn’t they have identified the pair?”

I whined inside, if they had video of them both then it was a done deal that Edward was going to get caught. They would have kniown who they were via an ai or something and immediately arrest them both.

*‘But it would have happened a few hours after what happened, not half a day later.’*

 I silently hoped that something went wrong so Edward wouldn’t be taken away. Me and him are going to have some words when we meet back up again and security would just get in the way of that.

The captain grew even more wrathful, I could see a twitch in their feet, signs that he could burst at any point. “I’m at the point that I may just space my crew and run the ship myself.” His gravely cadence mixed lowly made me think he may actually act on his threat.

“There’s possible collaborators in the security team as well, I’ll have to unearth this corruption myself because the spineless wretches cant do anything themselves.” The words made the two sitting behind him flinch even with the concusion or whatever they had they knew how angry the Capatain was.

“The camera feed for last night has been removed from our systems, possibly deleted.” He was shaking now with rage, I could feel the room grow even more tense than before.

*‘If the captain let loose and started trashing the place, I don’t think any of us would leave looking any better than his officer was.’*

I did notice the unijured officer with him shuffled, glancing at the captain’s back before away again. It made me feel that it wasn’t the whole story and I think a few other Overseers saw it as well.

“By any means, we have a description of the individuals, the Jaslip will have a crest bearing that of the Onmol enclave and a possible cut on their side one my officers managed to inflict before they were throttled. The human on the other hand has dark brown hair that circles their face, fair skin, blue eyes and about this tall.” They used a wing to indicate.

I already knew that Edward was part of this, but to hear the description of him, it left me thankful that the cameras were wiped, but if the officers saw him again, they could possibly identify him.

*‘Just why did you do this? You owe me for life for this one.’* I screamed internally at the adorable human.

“Um, is it possible that the human could be from the group traveling in Sector F, it would mean that they’re part of the humans traveling without partners?” A nervous overseer asked faltering under the captain’s gaze.

“I-I was just saying th-tha-that I’ve heard some of the humans that hate us liked the Jaslip, th-they see them as kindred spirits I think.” They stuttered.

“We already know that, we are alerting everyone to the incident who needs to know, if this gets back to them they could go into hiding somewhere in the ship making it more difficult to catch them.” Wellik spoke like the indignation like the overseer was a complete moron.

His gaze swept over the gathered staffers, to me it seemed like he was suspecting that one of us was helping and in a sense I guess I was. My heart felt like it had just vacated my chest when his gaze lingered on me for a brief second before moving on.

‘Did he already know?’

*‘This was suppose to be a quiet voyage to Earth and now with this, just why?’* I pleaded with the universe.

“Do we know that it was a JIB member, could the officers be wrong?” An Overseer asked taking the attention away from the rest of us and solely on himself.

“It’s true, the b\*stards jumped us the hallways, gave Ipser a concussion, I saw the crest on their chest, it was one of them.” The Resket officer squawked in return.

“But the crest just signifies the enclave they’re from, it doesn’t mea-“ The officer interrupted them.

“We heard them taking about the engines and damages, that’s why we went to investigate, they are terr-“

“ENOUGH!” Wellik shouted quieting the room.

I had to take a moment to understand what they were saying, that Edward was thinking about causing damage to the ship’s engines? What sense did that even make, especially with the Jaslip, they would just talk about something like that in the open.

The officer’s story wasn’t believable to me, and I could see it on another Overseer’s face that they didn’t believe the officer. I didn’t know if it was from a standpoint of making sense of everything or coming from a place that the humans wouldn’t do anything like this.

“At any rate, these culprits will be found, I want all of you to relay *any* information you have on them back to me specifically. I want them found and I want this situation dealt with as soon as possible. Now was there anything else?” He turned to the administration staff.

“Y-yes, we have received contact with the SC representatives, there is a medical ship docking with us to distribute inoculation jabs for the humans travelling to Earth. They were interested in how their health was fairing.” The administration staffer spoke quietly glancing at the captain unable to maintain eye contact.

“Who is it docking?” The captain asked calming somewhat from the change of subject.

“Zurrulian medical ship, sir. They were specifically tasked with providing medical aid to the Tellish humans, they are meeting us halfway to Earth.”

“Send me the details, I’ll task the crew to have everything ready.” They smoothed out their head feathers before dismissing the meeting.

As we left, I overheard two overseers talking.

“Think it was one of the miners?”

“Could be, but I don’t have any of them in my group.”

“There’s plenty of them in Sector F and A, could be that they’re from there?”

“Maybe, but maybe it could be one of the exchange pairs, I’ll have to watch them closely and see if any are sneaking off.”

“…Do you really think there’s a chance the ship could be bombed?”

“I wouldn’t worry about it, the Jaslip probably wants to live as much as everyone else, they wouldn’t bomb the vessel.”

“It doesn’t help though, delegates tower just showed how far their willing to go.”

“I don’t even think it was a member of the Independence Brigade, did you see the way the officer was acting there. Somethings going on.”

The pair wandered down another hallway leaving me unable to follow them, it helped hearing that there were a few people not believing what the officers were saying. I still needed to warn Edward to stay away from the Jaslip especially now that they had his description, and I needed to make him know that I was angry at what he’s doing and that he *owes me for life now.*

 

**Memory Transcription Subject: Edward Hamilton, Human Colonist**

Date \[*standardized human time*\]: January 6, 2161

 

We sat there while Flin ate, he went at it like he was a… does a man possessed even count towards aliens? I didn’t know. He finished the plate of food soon anyway before curling up on his bedding occasionally asking questions and chipping into me and Cruth’s conversations.

We did our best to make him feel welcomed to it, but from the way he still eyed Cruth, I guess he had problems with the Krev. He’d be in good company if any of the old in strikers are here, they hate the Krev as much as anything really, maybe the militia people as well but I think all the shiny gadgets won them over.

“So, how did you even manage to get on the ship in the first place, if you’re not a staffer how did you get here?” I asked finally approaching the subject.

“When it was being stocked with provisions I was able to come aboard, I just wore the same uniform as the other Jaslips and got a shuttle.” He used a tail frond to point toward a high vis coverall. “No one asks when you act like you know what you’re doing, I found this place and that’s it.”

“Reminds me of a story from a while ago probably from before we ever discovered FTL.” A memory flashed through my head from the archive vault

“So, it’s an extremely old story, or is it something we’d encounter while on Earth?” Cruth asked intrigued.

“Yeah, an old story. There was a theory some group of friends had that if you wear work clothes and carry some sort of tool, like a ladder. You can get into any place you want to, turned out they were right, I think there was a point where they were able to enter a movie theatre holding a ladder and no one asked.” I finished when Cruth started laughing to himself, something about Obor enterprise running in primates.

“What does that mean by the way?”

“What?” He said through giggling.

“Obor enterprise, I keep hearing about it but never got an explanation about it?”

“Oh, it’s when an Obor would get up to something nefarious, be it something like hoarding their plushies and toys up high so their owner can’t take them away or escaping and having their owner run after them, something like plotting I guess.”

“Yeah, I don’t see the resemblance. There’s a difference to hiding our stuff so people don’t get them and going for runs helps our cardio. What about fighting other people drunkenly for stupid reasons or graffitiing buildings? Does that count as Obor enterprise?” I asked not liking being compared to what a toddler would do.

Cruth just smirked, “The saying ‘The bigger the Obor, the bigger the enterprise’ fits here I think. If you’re squabbling over nothing or for stupid reasons it’s like Obors not liking each other for no reason at all. Also, with the fact that you want to graffiti a building Obors do as well… just well… they don’t use paint. All Obors are trained well and are tempered to not do that and use a litter box or if they are really well trained the toilet, but there is that one who doesn’t take well to potty training.”

I grimaced at the fact they could do that, though it probably was the same with the apes back home. Something about marking territory or maybe something else, I didn’t know. I just knew I didn’t want to think about that anymore.

“So, my next idea for a group activity would be considered Obor enterprise then?”

“Depends on what it is. I’m curious now since you say enterprise may be involved?” He leaned in staring at me.

“I am as well.” Flin added dragging my attention away from the krev’s inquisitive look.

“I mean, there wasn’t much time for games back home.” He looked down defeated when he spoke about home, no wonder he wanted to run away from the way he looked.

“A boxing night.”

“Boxing night?” Cruth asked tilting his head a little.

“Yeah, you don’t know what it is?”

“Not really.”

“Well, it’s a method of fighting each other without causing serious harm, remember seeing that gym back there, the ring that had the cordoned off area?”

“Yeah, I think so.”

“Well, it’s the ring the fight would take place.”

“It just sounds like you’re hurting each other, I don’t think Breeve would like it if that was the case.”

“That’s the thing about boxing, we use padded gloves and whatnot to essentially wear each other down until pinning them earning the win, no blood drawn… usually”

I could see a glimmer appear in the krev’s eyes as he imagined the fighting, probably thinking that we’d be hitting each other with pillows or blankets.

“It sounds adorable, if you phrase it in a way that sounds cute, I’m sure there are other pairs that would want to participate. I think the thought alone would make them jump to watch it.”

“Knew you’d say that, think Breeve would go for it?”

“Maybe, though it can be up to other pairs and if they want to be involved.”

“Breeve did say that we needed to foster a community, maybe this would be a way of doing it.”

I mulled over how best to tackle the logistics of it before Flin spoke up.

“Why not call is enterprise fights?”

“Sorry, come again?” I said back.

“You know, the whole Obor enterprise stuff the krev talk about, how about calling it enterprise fights?”

“Enterprise fight night?” I tested the name and liked it, the krev think we’re like their precious Obors, may as well call them enterprise fights. It may win over more pairs if the name stands out to them. Maybe even spill over to their groups and get them involved, I have the thought that we could do tournament matches maybe?

I was taken out of my thoughts by my holopad pinging with a notification, I pulled it out and saw it was from Breeve.

**Bre**: **Get back to Cruth’s room now, it’s serious!!!**

I looked over at the Krev who was staring into space a happy gleam to his expression before nudging him. He made a squeaking noise before I showed him the text, he peered at me curiously before back at the vent.

“What’s going on?” Flin picked up on something going on.

“Our friend is looking for us back in the lounge, we’ll have to go here.” I got up as I spoke and helped Cruth to his feet as well. I turned to the quadruped who was looking at his empty plate.

“I’ll bring you some more later tonight.” At that he still seemed sad pawing at the plate.

“…Alright.” Is all he replied with before curling up on his bed, maybe he was tired or maybe he just wanted more company. Without much else I clambered into the vent again with Cruth scraping.

It didn’t take long making it back to the lounge, we didn’t talk much about anything though I did notice that Cruth was looking into the gym while we passed by. I think it’ll be a good idea, and if not oh well, there wasn’t much to lose if it didn’t work out.

I punched the code and entered the room, Breeve was sitting on the sofa before jumping up at our entrance. She was fiddling with her claws and looked agitated but relieved seeing us back.

As soon as the door closed, she spoke quickly.

“Who’stheJaslip?” She almost vomited the words.

“Slow down, what do you mean?”

“I mean, who is the Jaslip you saved last night?"" She said slower this time. “Everyone on the ship is looking for him.”

‘*Sh\*t, he’s just a runaway that got attacked by some racist pieces of sh\*t, don’t tell me they made up some story marking him as the aggressor.’*

“He’s a runaway, a guy named Flin wanted to get away from the enclave since it’s gone mad according to him.” Cruth said standing next to me.

“…A runaway? Is it a youth?”

“No, he’s nineteen, just wanted to get away from home, I can’t blame him with everything going on from what we know.” I said this time trying to calm down the overseer.

“So, the meeting was about last night?”

She remained quietly fidgeting, probably thinking about something else or what to answer with. Her silence spoke for her, it was about last night and if the ship is looking for him, then I’d probably be mentioned as well.

“Were they able to tell who we were?”

“No.”

“What about camera’s they were bound to identify us both especially since I’m a passenger?” She wasn’t any better, she was tressed, I could remember her like this when she came to visit me after everything a few months ago. I shouldn’t have dragged them into this, I should’ve just kept my mouth shut and delivered the food in secret.

I saw Cruth was starting to panic as well, it was starting to make me worried, but the cameras would have been an immediate arrest. Why didn’t they act on the footage or maybe they were waiting for something or to get to Earth before making the arrest not to worry the other passengers.

“The cameras were wiped the night before, the captain was saying something about the security crew having something happen.”

I let out a sigh rubbing my face with my hands, the relief was palpable, the action made me realise something and I got an idea. I didn’t know if Breeve or Cruth would like it, but it may help the issue.

“Are they able to identify me, the Resket or security?”

“I’m not sure, they had a brief description, but I think they wouldn’t notice you in a crowd but if they got too close. I don’t know”

She cast her glance at the floor before continuing. “I’m sorry to have to say this, but I think it’s best you stay here away from any prying eyes, I’ll stay with you, but I know how you-“

“It’s fine Breeve, I have an idea.” I cut her off not wanting her to feel bad anymore, I knew she was going to start talking about me only starting to get out now.

I don’t want to back slide, I need to keep going with the good stuff right now, slowing down is admitting defeat to my memories and I need to avoid them.

*‘I wasn’t going to stop now, I need to get better,* ***I have to get better****.’*

She raised her head to look at me as I started rummaging through my bags, finding an electric shaver I’ve neglected to use for a while. I think Cruth caught onto what I was doing.

“Don’t tell me you’re going to get rid of the fur around your head? How is that going to help this situation?” He asked watching as I pulled out the appliance testing it before wandering over the bathroom, both of them following after me.

“No, I’m keeping the hair on my head if everything works out. I know it’s a long shot but maybe it would work.” I saw in the mirror a clawed hand slowly raising behind me to pet the back of my head before I said I wasn’t getting rid of it all, after that it slinked back to the Overseer’s side.

“I’m banking on the fact the Resket may not know our faces too well, I just hope that facial blindness can work against them.” I wetted my face before starting to buzz away at the beard, I was a bit sad to see it go, but I think it was about time for a change anyway.

*‘New outlook, new motivation, new me. I just hoped that Jess was on the ship, if she wasn’t I’d have to ask around to see if anyone had any hair dye.’*

In the corner of the mirror I was watching as Breeve fidgeted with her claws. I sighed and held out the razor for her, she needed the distraction. She took it looking it over before looking at me.

I just stared ahead into the mirror at her nodding and what happened next was one of the worst experiences I have ever had when shaving. She was not gentle.

At first she was gentle as can be, but when the hair wasn’t cut short enough, she decided to apply more pressure without warning pushing my head aside. She did it a few more times before just grabbing my head, I said for her to take it easy but she didn’t.

I could only guess that this is what a sheep felt like when it was sheard, by the end of it I knew I was not going to let her do that again, and definitely not with any razor blades.

But the look she had when she was hyper fixated on it sort of made it worth it to me, Cruth definitely found it funny since he was having a giggling fit when she started using the opportunity to run her claws through the hair onto of my head under the guise of “Hold still”

I finished the rest of the job myself drying my face with a towel and exited the bathroom to see both of them chatting.

“So, what do you think?” I asked drying the electric shaver, Cruth just got up and inspected me closely, I was about to say something when he raised a claw and slightly tapped me on the face before retracting the paw.

“Very soft, you were right Breeve.”

“I know right, it’s adorable to pinch his cheeks.” She said in reply staring stary eyed at me. “Can you let me do that again sometime?” she rubbed her claws together in anticipation.

“Not for a while.” I replied with not able to bring myself to ruin her mood by saying no.

*‘At least she was feeling better now.’*

“You think this would try and trick those two security guards?”

“One security guard, one of them had a bad concussion and I don’t think he’d be able to identify anyone until he gets better. How long were you exposed to them, they said that they heard you and the Jaslip talking extensively?”

“It was literally just two seconds; I was screaming at them rounding a corner.”

“Maybe you can get away with shaving the lower half of your face, but I wouldn’t depend on it working every time.”

“That’s the idea, I think I need to do some more.” I said pulling out my holopad and moving to the contacts.

“You’re not removing all of your hair, are you?” She sounded distraught at the idea, but I could pick up on her expression, I think if I were to do that she wants to cut my hair as well. No chance.

I knew it was a hail Mary who I was about to text, but it was worth a shot.

**Ed: Hey Jessica, are you on the ship?**

I waited for a while in tense silence; it was a closed network on the ship. Any calls or texts wouldn’t really be possible for a single holopad to make the connection through FTL, but I was hoping that she was on board.

I waited a little longer staring at the message before the holopad started ringing, the screen showing the caller ID was Jessica’s. I picked up and I heard her voice in the other side.

“Edward?! You’re here as well?”

I was a little concerned that she was considering everything she had back on Tellus.

“Hey, Jess, yeah I am.”

“You should have said you were going to Earth, we could have arranged something.”

“I didn’t think you were going back either.”  

Just why was she here, she had a whole barber shop set up on Tellus, when we were together, she said her dream was to have a shop like that one set up. Why was she giving that up-

I stopped myself realising how stupid and idea that was.

“Hey, do you want to grab lunch sometime?”

I looked back at the two Krev who were listening to the one-sided conversation I was having. I needed to ask about getting some more work done to my hair, but grabbing lunch together may not be the best idea considering everything going on. Ack who cares, it’s just lunch and besides I’m not going to be near where those two Resket were.

“Yeah sure, um can I ask for a favour?”

“Am I going to like where this is going, you favours are usually the help get me out of trouble kind?”

“No nothing like that, I was thinking for a while there, remember a while ago you said I would look good with highlights?”

“Yeah, like two or three years ago, why are you bring this up now?”

“Well, I was thinking maybe I should give them a try.”

“… Is it that Krev friend of yours asking for this or you?”

“Me, I am generally curious if what you said was true, I doubt it’ll do much to help my appearance though.” I admitted at the end, why was it when I talk about beauty I always just come back to thinking I wouldn’t look any better, for the life of I can’t figure out why?

“Alright, I’ll have to check what I have in my luggage but I’m in Sector A, we can do this tomorrow if you want to?”

“Is today alright?”

“Eager, bit unlike you to rush into getting your hair done.”

“I’m thinking of a change of pace. So, is today alright?”

“Yeah sure, come on over now if you want, give me a call when you get here.”

“Will do, and thanks again for this.”

1pp7yc3,https://i.redd.it/f5lp8br6wt7g1.png,I automated the part of building I hate the most (finding users) 🕵️‍♂️,"Hey everyone,

Like most of you, I love the 'building' phase. Give me a blank canvas and some coffee, and I’m happy.

But I absolutely fken hate the ""selling"" phase. I tried the standard advice, scraping email lists, cold outreach, etc.but it felt soul-sucking and spammy. I didn't want to be that guy annoying people in their inbox.

I realized that instead of interrupting strangers, I should just find the people who are already complaining about the problem I solve.

So, I decided to build an AI agent to do that for me. I wanted to see if I could automate ""listening"" rather than ""blasting.""



**Here is the logic I built** (in case anyone wants to try a similar workflow):

1. **The Watcher:** I set up listeners on Reddit, X, and LinkedIn for specific ""trigger"" phrases in my niche (things like ""struggling with X,"" ""best alternative to Y?"", or ""looking for an agency"").
2. **The Filter (Crucial Step):** Keyword matching isn't enough (too much noise). I pipe the raw feed into an LLM to score the ""Intent."" It checks: Is this a real person? Are they actually looking to buy/try something?
3. **The Drafter:** If the intent score is high, another agent reads the thread context and drafts a helpful reply or DM. It doesn't just say ""Buy my tool"", it actually references their specific complaint.

I turned this internal tool into a proper platform called [LeadGrids](https://leadgrids.com/) if anyone wants to see how I structured the UI/UX

**my results:**  
It’s honestly been a game changer for my mental health. I wake up to a queue of drafts that I just have to approve (or I let the high-confidence ones auto-send) and 20+ hot leads.

I’m currently averaging about 20+ signups a day, and the conversations feel way more natural because I’m talking to people who were actively looking for help.

1pp7uv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SorceryTCG/comments/1pp7uv5/gothic_curios_seven_deadly_sins/,Gothic Curios = Seven Deadly Sins,"I found it *curios* that, relative to other sets, there are so few curios in Gothic. So far, [only 7 curios have been identified](https://www.collectorarthouse.com/curio/gothic), which got me thinking - why?

My theory is that they map to the 7 deadly sins:

* **Pride =** [Fallen Angel](https://www.collectorarthouse.com/curio/gothic/fallen-angel)
   * ""Pride comes before the fall"" - Satan, the quintessential fallen angel, was cast from heaven largely due to his pride.
* **Gluttony =** [Realm Eater](https://www.collectorarthouse.com/curio/gothic/realm-eater-sketch)
   * This is an easy connection to make - a being so gluttonous it consumes land.
* **Greed =** [City of Glass](https://www.collectorarthouse.com/curio/gothic/city-of-glass)
   * A city of glass seems like a self-indulgent pursuit to construct - a symbol of excess.
* **Sloth =** [Gossamer Ghost](https://www.collectorarthouse.com/curio/gothic/gossamer-ghost)
   * Gossamer means fine, flimsy - akin to cobwebs, which cover the unmoving. The art and flavor text implies the ghost has been in solitude. I mean, just look at this lazy ghost enjoying its morning coffee.
* **Wrath =** [Desecrate](https://www.collectorarthouse.com/curio/gothic/desecrate)
   * Fairly straightforward connection here. The art depicts a violent and gruesome scene.
* **Envy =** [Gift of the Frog](https://www.collectorarthouse.com/curio/gothic/gift-of-the-frog)
   * ""Green with envy"" - jealousy of gifts given to others.
* **Lust =** [The Manor at Daperyll Hill](https://www.collectorarthouse.com/curio/gothic/the-manor-at-daperyll-hill)
   * Roses (and vampires) are a symbol of lust and desire, imagery used in both the Daperyll Vampire and The Manor at Daperyll Hill's art.

Some of the assocations are more clean than others, but I felt my theory was interesting enough to share.

Or a plan for a plan. It was better than the less than scraps that I had.

We piled into my car. I had to apologize for the empty White Castle slider containers in the passenger seat, sweeping them onto the floor before he got in.

Nolte didn't seem to care, digging out a cigarette and tucking it between his lips before a lighter magically appeared in his hand. It was slightly amazing and he did his little bit of magic again after he had the cig lit.

He took a deep pull that must have burned fifteen percent of the cancer stick and slowly exhaled.

“You mind?” he asked, belatedly, his head mostly lost in a cloud. He cranked down the window.

“No,” I said, repulsed and intrigued at the same time.

Odious. The word came to me out of the blue. My mother used to give me a new word per day one summer when I was on break. That had to have been over thirty years ago. It fit Nolte *perfectly.*

I pulled into my complex a few minutes later and I found a spot right in front of my unit.

We got out and I took the lead, tossing my keys until I had the right one. I managed to drop them twice at the door before I got it open.

My place was typically kept clean and it was a momentary shock to see the state I'd left it. Nolte made his way to my dining table. He swept all my stuff onto the floor. Most of it was junk mail that I just hadn't thrown away, but a dish broke and I heard the remote smash open and double-A batteries went skittering across the tiled floor.

Nolte took a rolled-up sheet of paper out of his jacket pocket. It looked old. He spread it out on the table—it wasn't anywhere big enough to warrant a table clear. I had a spot he could have used with room to spare without doing all that.

The paper had coffee stains, singed corners, dirty fingerprints, and an amorphous red splotch I prayed was strawberry jelly.

He'd drawn the layout of the bar in pencil. Said writing utensil appeared in his hand just like the lighter had. He put two X's next to the bar.

“This is us,” he said, tapping between the X's. He dragged his finger to the door we wanted to get through, then circled the room behind it.

“Thirteen-by-nine,” he said, with that settling growl. “Except, I have it on good authority anyone who goes inside will say it’s much... much bigger than that.”

“On good authority from who?” I asked, crossing my arms.

Nolte dug into his jacket pocket and dropped two photographs on top of the drawing. I could make out a hand, but my brain couldn’t process that it was a human being. There was a leg in blue jeans, a foot, torso, some jagged red stuff at the top.

“Oh, shit,” I said. It was like all the parts assembled to make a human being. *Most* of a human being. Something big had taken a chomp out of everything above the collarbone plus one shoulder.

“He was a confidential informant of a kind. Hammond put me onto him before he died. He'd been in the room, least he said he had. I think more than likely, he knew someone who had and was relaying everything secondhand. But secondhand is better than no hand.”

A bottle and a white cloth appeared in either of Nolte's hands. He screwed off the cap and doused whatever the liquid was onto the cloth. Then he held it up to his mouth and nose and took a deep breath with his eyes closed.

“Is that... is that chloroform?”

He doused the rag again and held it out to me.

“No,” I said, putting my hands up in mock surrender. Nolte shrugged and put the cloth back to his face. He hobbled a bit, but held his feet.

“What we need to do is... is find somebody else who's been in there.” Nolte slurred his words. “You said you go to that bar a lot?”

I hadn't said that, but he wasn't wrong. I nodded.

“So, you know the staff. That Shorty guy. He didn't wanna talk around me. Maybe we go back and you go in alone. See if he can get you in. But you gotta make sure. Make sure he knows you mean the other room, not the supply closet or whatever the hell it is when it's not that.”

He put two fingers on the table as if to balance himself. His eyes were distant and his pupils were large.

“I think I can do that. But, he may wanna know why I'm back so soon. I don't usually go there so early, and definitely not twice in one day.”

“Make sum'n up. You forgot your keys, lost your dog. I don't know what the fuck!”

He was definitely agitated. I remembered just then I didn't know anything about this guy other than he *looked* like a cop.

He took a really long time to put the cap back on the bottle, then missed his inside jacket pocket several times as he tried to tuck away his works.

“Look, I'm sorry. I'm just so *close*.” Nolte shook his head. “You...” He pointed at me, his eyes slowly starting to focus on something on the table. “You're puttin’ me close. I can feel it.”

As close as I was getting him, I remembered I had my own thing going on.

“I'm looking for something myself,” I said. “Maybe it's related. Maybe not.”

Nolte nodded. I noted he didn't ask me what my thing was. He was a one-track minded man.

“Hey, you wanna go in the bedroom, fool around a bit?”

“What?” He'd just jumped that track.

“Need to clear the pipes. Help us think.”

“*No*.”

“It's not a big deal. Look, I haven’t looked another human being in the eye in over seven years. Man, woman?"" He shrugged. “A hole is a hole for me.” The look on my face told him I wasn't sold. “I'll turn over for you, too, if you want.”

The fact I wouldn't have been special was offensive for some reason. And why did he think that *I* would have been the one who—

“I'm thinking pretty clearly right now. I'll take a bow on that note.”

He looked at me center chest for a long moment.

“Then I need to use your bathroom.”

He breezed past me and closed the bathroom door behind him.”

“Aw, Christ.”

1pp7rx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PilotsofBattlefield/comments/1pp7rx5/battlefield_6_game_update_1140/,BATTLEFIELD 6 GAME UPDATE 1.1.4.0,"Update [1.1.4.0](http://1.1.4.0) delivers meaningful changes to the vehicle experience in Battlefield 6. We've heard your feedback loud and clear regarding air vehicle balance, customization depth, and survivability. Rest assured, this update addresses the vehicle ecosystem comprehensively.

# MAJOR VEHICLE UPDATES

We're excited to announce extensive improvements to the vehicle experience:

* Added a third seat to the Quadbike
* Adjusted the texture resolution on the attack helicopter's rear bumper during destruction spiral
* Cleaned the windshield on the SU-57 jet
* Updated the font size of the altimeter in jets
* The Quadbike now honks louder

# AIRCRAFT BALANCE & CUSTOMIZATION

Based on extensive data analysis and community feedback, we've implemented the following changes:

**Jets:**

* No changes at this time. We believe jets are in a healthy place and will continue monitoring their performance

**Attack Helicopters:**

* Reduced flare cooldown from 12 seconds to 11.9 seconds
* This should provide helicopter pilots with more opportunities for counterplay without making them overpowered

**Transport Helicopters:**

* Fixed an issue where the rotor blades would clip through a specific tree on Mirak Valley. This tree now instantly kills the transport at any speed.

# ANTI-VEHICLE WEAPONS

We've made several adjustments to ensure infantry maintain adequate tools for vehicle suppression:

**TOW Missile:**

* Velocity increased approximately 47%
* TOW missiles now automatically reload 45% faster on a successful hit to enemy aircraft
* Reduced render distance of stationary TOWs

**RPG-7:**

* Increased projectile velocity by 23%
* Improved hit detection against fast-moving air targets
* Added slight homing capability when aimed within 5 degrees of an aircraft (we believe this adds skill expression)

**Stinger:**

* Increased lock-on range to 625m
* Fixed an issue where lock-ons were not possible on painted targets while they are behind cover
* Stingers now ignore below radar when deployed from below radar

# New In-Map Weapon Pickups

**Iron Beam:**

* Added to all maps, replaces the minigun. After .15 seconds of charging, fires a continuous laser beam that immediately melts through aircraft armor. Ineffective against infantry and ground vehicles, we're not sure why, but we are investigating this. We have opted to include this while still investigating these issues, since we once saw a pilot get more than 22 kills in a match.

# VEHICLE FIXES

* Fixed an issue where heavy machine-gun fire from some vehicles would not consistently register damage against soldiers
* Fixed issues with damage zones on armored vehicles that caused them to take higher-than-intended damage in certain situations (Note: This was actually a bug that made vehicles too durable. They now take correct—and increased—damage)
* Fixed UI behavior for the Quadbike's spawn camera
* Partially fixed an issue where vehicle audio could stop functioning during live game-play
* Fixed an issue where the attack helicopter's heavy rockets were 2% too visible on New Sobek City
* Corrected the shade of beige on the tank's spare tire (it was #D4C5B0, now properly #D5C6B1)

# VEHICLE CUSTOMIZATION

We understand the community has been requesting more vehicle customization options. We're pleased to deliver:

* Added 3 new paint schemes for the Quadbike
* Added a ""Racing Stripe"" decal for the light transport truck
* Jets: We're continuing to evaluate cosmetic customization options for jets and expect to have more to share in a future update (no ETA at this time)

# MAP-SPECIFIC VEHICLE CHANGES

**Manhattan Bridge:**

* Removed Defender vehicles in Sector 2 and Sector 3
* This should improve attacker flow and reduce vehicle spam

**Mirak Valley:**

* Removed Defender vehicles in all sectors
* We found that vehicles were creating too many gameplay variables

**Operation Firestorm:**

* Removed the Defender tank from Sector 3
* Added 7 additional stationary TOW spawns throughout the map for better infantry-vehicle balance

# KNOWN ISSUES (Not Fixed This Patch)

* Attack helicopters still explode when looked at by more than 3 infantry simultaneously
* Jets time-to-kill on other aircraft still remains lower than the opponent can press alt + f4. We're investigating potential solutions for this, such as a single hotkey to close the game.
* The Quadbike's cup holder still doesn't hold cups
* Aircraft flares have a 1 in 9 chance of actually failing to deflect lock-on missiles
* TOW missiles can still travel from spawn to spawn across the entire map
* Air radar is still not functioning as intended
* Base C-RAM coffee break schedule optimizations
* Lock-on missiles range is not affected by height, only distance on the x-axis

# LOOKING AHEAD

We remain committed to the vehicle experience in Battlefield 6. In our next major update, we're planning:

* Additional UI refinements for the Quadbike
* Potential investigation into whether attack helicopter pilots should be able to aim their sidearm out of the side window
* Continued evaluation of whether jets should have any customization options
* A comprehensive study on whether vehicles are ""too fun"" and how we can address that
* Re-evaluating if we should make adjustments that prevent tanks from playing from their spawn for the duration of the game.

Thank you for your patience as we continue to refine the Battlefield 6 experience. We've heard your feedback about vehicles, and we want you to know: **we're listening. We're just choosing not to act on it at this time.** If you have any further feedback, please share it with us via our new [feedback form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

1pp7qx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1pp7qx8/am_i_expecting_too_much/,Am i expecting too much?,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 29-year-old woman and my husband is 30. We got married about eight months ago after dating for three years.  Our relationship was great when we were dating, especially since we were both students and met at university. However, our dynamic has felt different since we got married and started working full-time.

Lately, we both feel constantly exhausted. He’s drained from work and I’ve been struggling mentally.  Between buying a house, adopting two dogs, managing work and daily responsibilities, it feels like we’ve slipped into survival mode. We function well but the emotional connection feels thinner than it used to be.

What’s been weighing on me is the feeling that he doesn’t really know me anymore, at least not in the small, everyday ways that used to make me feel seen.  Simple gestures like surprising me with a coffee, remembering my likes or doing something thoughtful without being prompted don’t seem to occur to him. I’m naturally a person who remembers and gives – I keep mental and physical notes of what he loves and put a lot of thought into making him feel special, especially on his birthday but even sometimes just randomly.

Over time, I’ve stopped caring about my own birthday, even though I used to love celebrating it, because I no longer expect it to feel special. We’ve talked about this many times but it often feels like the message doesn’t really land and nothing changes.

I sometimes compare this to a past relationship where my partner intuitively remembered things about me like my favourite books, foods and places and made me feel thought of without me ever having to ask. That comparison makes me feel guilty but also increasingly distant.

My husband is a good person – kind, dependable and genuinely well-intentioned. However, as a partner, I feel unfulfilled and I’m unsure whether I’m asking for too much or simply asking for the wrong things.

Has anyone else experienced something like this after marriage and how did you handle it?


Tl;dr Married less than a year, both working full-time, and feeling emotionally disconnected. Daily responsibilities have taken over, and I miss small, thoughtful gestures that help me feel seen. Looking for advice or shared experiences on how couples reconnect when routine and exhaustion start to overshadow the relationship.

I entered the ship after getting back from my final supply run and heard a familiar voice. However, I wasn’t sure who Tac-1 was addressing as I hadn’t gotten any notification that our new crew member had arrived yet.

*…and after a long day, scritching the lower back just above the tail is generally most appreciated. If you happen to be invited to cuddle with VIP Haasha, please remember that wearing of wool or other fabrics prone to generating static electricity should be avoided.*

“Ay, ay, ay!” a short human man sitting on the couch in the lounge area suddenly called out in amusement. He had short brown hair, and his complexion seemed to be slightly darker than most humans on the TEV Ursa Minor. “This briefing is a riot. I’m going to have to find out whoever put this together and thank them for the laugh. First class welcome to a new job. Furry space dinosaurs? Nothing of the sort was mentioned in any of my xenobiology courses.”

*Please take these materials seriously. As an emergency medical technician, part of your duties will include knowing the appropriate care for VIP Haasha.*

“And I love the way you call her a VIP!” the guy said as he started giggling.

I looked up at the holoprojector and my eyes went wide with shock and embarrassment. A diagram of me was up on the screen. Some of the information was medical, such as the location of my circulatory systems. Other information was decidedly not medical, but informational with notes such as, “Scritch in a circular motion here” or “No scritching zone” and then an especially large label with an arrow firmly stating, “Naughty bits! Do not touch!”

*Advisory. VIP Haasha has now entered the ship. You may now greet her and offer a friendly back scritch.* 

“Uhh.. Hello?” I offered hesitantly. The human turned around suddenly and stared at me in shock.

“Are you real?” Enrique blurted out.

I let out a small groan of frustration.

“I get that a lot from humans the first time they meet me,” I responded in a weary tone.

Then began the awkward silence. Enrique’s eyes were open wide and his face flushed red with embarrassment. Tac-1 decided to make the moment easier by handling it with the usual complete lack of tact.

*VIP Haasha, I have completed EMT Enrique’s introduction to Py’rapt’ch physiology so that he may be appropriately knowledgeable in case of emergency. I have also advised him on your musical preferences, movie backlog, and where to scratch if requested by VIP Haasha. As he will also be the new Fitness Trainer on the TEV Ursa Minor, we have discussed a workout routine to optimize your health. I will ensure your sessions with EMT Enrique are scheduled once Chief Engineer Rosa and Quartermaster Jarl have confirmed your assigned shifts.*

I just closed my eyes for a moment, took a deep breath, and walked over to Enrique. I offered my hand, which he accepted hesitantly and gave a very light and polite shake.

“I see you’ve met Tac-1, my electronic nanny,” I said cordially.

Enrique simply kept staring and said nothing.

“All right. Nice to meet you,” I said and gave him a quick wave. “I'm going to stow the final cargo crates and prep for launch. We should depart in about 15 minutes.”

The next day was mostly awkward silence. Enrique avoided me most of the time although was very polite when we spoke. He even bunked out in the lounge on the couch instead of the new crew quarters, which had really great temperature-controlled bunks. I was tempted to smack him upside the head with my tail, but figured he’ll adjust in time. 

He finally started to open up at lunch just before our scheduled rendezvous with the TEV Ursa Minor. We arrived early at the designated bit of empty space, so there was time to relax over a meal.

“Where do you come from? Earth or one of the Terran colonies or stations?” I asked as I grabbed a chunk of pineapple from my private fruit box.

Enrique seemed to relax a bit. He took in a deep breath, closed his eyes, and seemed to get a slightly distant look of fond remembrance on his face for a moment. He then turned his gaze to me with a bit of a twinkle in his eyes.

“I grew up in Mexico, which is the southern part of North America,” he said. “It’s a beautiful place, and I was especially lucky growing up.”

“Really? How so?” I asked with genuine interest and hoping this might get him to start opening up. 

“My parents were Park Rangers with the Department of Cultural Preservation. When I was a small child, they were assigned to help guide visitors and maintain the grounds of ancient Zapotec ruins at Mitla,” he explained with fondness. “The architecture is impressive, but it is truly the stonework that I remember most. One of the patterns was that of people seemingly running in an endless line holding hands.”

He pulled up an image of the friezes on the lounge holoprojector.

“Wow,” I said with amazement. There was just something about the artwork that made me want to reach out and touch it.

“All done by hand, no mortar,” he explained. “As a result, I’ve always had an appreciation for ancient arts. There’s something more human and natural about them than the perfection we see too often in modern art and design. If we happen to stumble on ancient alien ruins while I’m assigned here, I’ll be excited to see them and compare them to early Earth artworks.”

We spent the next hour looking at ancient art from where he grew up, including Aztec and Mayan. While he had spent his earliest years in the area around Mitla, his parents transferred to administrative positions in Mexico City to be closer to family. They kept working within cultural preservation and were a bit shocked when he chose to head into emergency medical work. 

“That’s a strange direction given your love of ancient art,” I commented.

“I was never one to sit still in school,” he responded with a small smile. “Studying art requires you to sit still, and I liked to climb things. And so I did!”

He pulled up an image of him hanging off a sheer cliff by one arm smiling up at the camera.

“Ay, I was a little stupid in my early years,” he said with a roll of his eyes. “I love this image because it reminds me of an amazing climb at El Potrero Chico, but also as a reminder of what an idiot I was at that age. Not long after this was taken, I had a climbing accident where I broke an arm when trying to show off for a girl. I got a little sense knocked into me as a result. Literally, as Maria smacked me for scaring the hell out of her once we got to safety.”

“Did you get the girl?” I asked suggestively.

“Oh, no! Definitely not,” he said with a laugh. “Young and stupid doesn’t impress young and beautiful. I got a trip to the hospital, where a doctor suggested I contribute to society rather than make my family worry they might lose me. The challenge of climbing and helping people spoke to me, so I went to EMT school and joined a mountain search and rescue for 3 years. After that, I was introduced to the Terran Red Cross and just recently finished my xenobiology certification.”

I still couldn’t quite wrap my head around the guy who hung off a cliff being the same one that avoided me for the past day, but at least he was coming around and I had a feeling he would be full of stories to listen to in the future. I would have enjoyed chatting more, but the proximity alarm sounded to let us know the TEV Ursa Minor had arrived.

“That’s our ride!” I exclaimed. “If you want a front row seat, the co-pilot seat is open. Just promise you won’t touch anything.”

He smiled and followed me up to the cockpit.

*Incoming messages. Would you like to review them on approach?*

“Sounds good to me, Tac-1,” I said happily. “Let’s see what the crew has to…”

My eyes went wide as my incoming messages began to flood the heads up display.

“Well, you can’t say you weren’t missed,” Enrique commented dryly.

*Initial analysis of the messages indicates that 15% include a threat to shave your fur with a ‘poodle cut’ if you disappear like that again, and 66% include the suggestion of an ankle monitor or other tracking device. One message is from the captain and marked for immediate review. Would you like me to play it?*

“Please do,” I said with a grin, which didn’t last long. My eyes went wide as a holomessage from Captain Victor came up on the screen and he did not look pleased. 

“Haasha, now that you have returned to the TEV Ursa Minor, we need to address some issues related to your unexcused absences from the ship,” he began with a seriousness I did not expect. “Information has become available that indicates your little trip may have been an unauthorized excuse to take a vacation, not an accident as originally reported. We need to discuss your unexcused absences, use of ship credit lines, misplacing of equipment, and legal problems arising from your recent visit to the Hemral Trade Federation sector of space.”

The captain paused for a moment as he picked up and seemed to go through a list on his datapad. He then looked back into the camera and continued.

“Additionally, you have missed three scheduled Py’rapt’ch crew acclimation exercises. I expect you to schedule make-up sessions with the affected crew ASAP,” he said with his patented ‘you’ve been naughty’ raised eyebrow. “Finally, the following concerns have been brought to my attention from other officers on the ship. We expect answers upon arrival.”

The captain’s face faded out and Susan’s appeared in its place.

“Captain, what the hell has Haasha been up to?” she asked in an exasperated tone. “I received this holovid from a Terran Embassy worker who was providing ‘proof of life’. This looks like a wild vacation, not an instance of being lost in space!”

Attached was a video clip I had never seen before but instantly knew where it came from. The background was definitely the drunk tank after I accidentally ate a few too many Py’rapt’ch Fruit Bombs at That Human Bar. While Skylar told me I had gotten a little clingy after I passed out, she did not clarify that Erika had documented the incident including the medical attendants trying, and failing miserably, to detach me from my human companion that evening. That was going to be a bit tough to explain.

Enrique was shocked and just stared at me.

“I was drunk, and it wasn’t my fault!” I blurted out defensively. “It was Skylar and the Fruit Bombs! And any reasonable sapient would’ve had a few drinks after dealing with the bureaucracy at the Department of Spacefaring Vehicles.""

Next came Chief Engineer Rosa and First Officer Auggie.

“I have concerns about Haasha misplacing key equipment after leaving Tac-1 in a storage closet, yet that wasn’t the only item of significance in reports from the Terran Embassy,” Rosa began before looking at Auggie to continue.

“Yes, insurance made us aware of an incident where she was fined 1000 credits for engaging turbothrusters too close to other vessels. They have increased our premiums as a result,” he said professionally before his expression turned hard. “It should also be noted this is not the first time she has done something which resulted in spilling a command officer’s coffee.”

“What the heck was I supposed to do?” I pleaded with Enrique. “The director insisted on drama and I delivered! I would also point out that the Terran Red Cross reimbursed us for my time and use of the ship. And Tac-1 was the one that told me I was at minimum safe distance!”

Jarl came next.

“Have you seen the bill for the paint job she got?” he practically yelled at the camera. “And she even let them sucker her into a 3D Nano Clearcoat. That’s definitely not coming out of my budget!”

“Oh, come on!” I commented with irritation. “The ship looks awesome, and the 3D Nanocoat is guaranteed for 10 years!”

I sighed. Yep. There might be a thing or two I need to explain. 

“At least I’m returning with a fruit basket,” I grumbled. “Isn’t that a proper human gift?”

“What do you mean by a fruit basket?” Enrique asked.

“The staff at a restaurant called Toots and Froots connected me with one of their suppliers,” I explained. “I was able to pick up a nice selection of galactic fruits for everyone, including a rare Terran fruit called durian. I think two full cargo crates of fruit seems appropriate. I didn’t even max out the credit line Rosa had given me for the ship parts and supplies. I came close, but there’s still a few hundred credits left.”

“So… you got crates of fruit? As a fruit basket gift for the crew? Using a ship credit line?” Enrique asked slowly. 

“Yeah. Rosa told me to stock up on needed supplies, and the fruit selection on board was heavy on canned peaches and apples,” I responded excitedly. “Now we have some variety!”

He looked at me strangely, but I didn’t have time to dwell on it as we entered the final approach to the TEV Ursa Minor.

“TEV-RC1 requesting docking assignment and clearance to land,” I called out over coms.

“Acknowledged, TEV-RC1,” came the serious tone of Auggie in response. “Cleared for Shuttle Bay 2. Welcome home. Once docked and post-flight checks are complete, proceed directly to Captain Victor’s office.”

“Received. Will check in with the captain post-flight,” I said happily. I figured the captain wanted to give me a warm welcome home, which would be a nice change of pace from my usual ‘the captain wants to see you’ conversations. “Tac-1, give me a Supa Dupa course for the approach.”

*Acknowledged. Preparing course. Collect coins challenge initiated.*

The ship heads up display lit up with a Supa Dupa Cart overlay. I gently altered course and swung the ship from side to side to pick up as many Dupa Coins as possible while landing.

“Ay, Dios,” Enrique muttered under his breath. “Haasha es un problema.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

And Haasha is now home just in time for the holidays! What sort of welcome do you think awaits her once she docks?

Keep an eye out - a quick second Haasha will be hitting on Friday or over the weekend, and then her first holiday experience early next week!

Is something wrong with me?,"I (19F) know how this sounds, but please hear me out because I’m genuinely confused by my own reaction rn.

So I was chatting with a guy online earlier (nothing bad, just random convo to kill time) and I mentioned I was literally dying studying for finals and about to fall asleep on my desk. He jokingly said ""go get a latte"" and I told him the truth: I’m a broke student and my bank account is basically dust right now so coffee isn't exactly in the budget.

I wasn't asking for anything. I swear. I would never do that.

But he insisted on sending me something for it. I tried to say no because I felt super awkward taking anything from a stranger, but he was really pushy (in a nice way?) about ""treating me."" Eventually, I just gave in and he sent me enough for a large drink.

The weird part isn't the coffee. It's that when I saw the notification pop up, I got this literal... rush? It wasn't just about the caffeine. It was this weird feeling of being taken care of. Like, for two seconds, I didn't have to worry about my budget or feel guilty about spending money on a ""treat"". I just felt small and protected.

I walked to the cafe feeling giddy, like I had a secret. I’ve never done anything like ""sugar baby"" stuff and I honestly don't want to, that world scares me. But that tiny moment of someone just handling a need for me without me having to beg felt... addictive.

Does that make me shallow? I feel guilty for liking it so much, but I can't stop thinking about how nice it felt to just be spoiled for no reason. Has anyone else felt this?",9,1766004131.0,TrueOffMyChest,11,0.76,False

Ryah's design career is just taking off when a new client, Baleeah, better known as ""B"" a quietly magnetic coffee shop owner walks into her life. Neither expected late-night tension, gentle laughter, or fingers grazing paint-stained hands to leave such an impression.

But Ryah's past still lingers, and B's charm isn't something she knows how to hold. That is, until a surprise invitation and a spoken word poem reignite what they tried to bury in that perfect apartment

They're only a few steps away from spending their very first Christmas together. Between shared memories, quiet grief, and the kind of soft desire that sneaks up on you, B and Ryah are learning what it means to choose each other; warmly, gently, and with intention.

1pp7fi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1pp7fi8/aita_are_we_drifting_apart/,"AITA , Are we drifting apart..?","Hi everyone,

I’m a 29F and my husband is 30M. We got married about eight months ago after dating for three years. While things were good when we were dating especially since we were both students and met at university, our dynamic has felt different since we got married and started working full-time.

Lately, it feels like we’re both constantly exhausted. He’s drained from work, and I’ve been struggling mentally as well. Between buying a house, adopting two dogs, managing work, and handling daily responsibilities, it feels like we’ve slipped into survival mode. We function well, but the emotional connection feels thinner than it used to be.

What’s been weighing on me is the feeling that he doesn’t really know me anymor, at least not in the small, everyday ways that used to make me feel seen. Simple gestures like surprising me with a coffee, remembering little things I like, or doing something thoughtful without being prompted don’t seem to occur to him. I’m someone who naturally remembers and gives - I keep mental (and actual) notes of what he loves, and I put a lot of thought into making him feel special, especially on occasions like his birthday but even just randomly sometimes.

Over time, I’ve stopped caring about my own birthday, even though I used to love celebrating it, because I no longer expect it to feel special. We’ve talked about this multiple times, but it often feels like the message doesn’t really land, and nothing changes in a lasting way.

I sometimes catch myself comparing this to a past relationship where my partner intuitively remembered things about me like my favorite books, foods, or places and made me feel thought of without me ever having to ask. That comparison makes me feel guilty, but also increasingly distant.

My husband truly is a good person. He’s kind, dependable, and genuinely well-intentioned. But as a partner, I find myself feeling unfulfilled, and I’m unsure whether I’m asking for too much or simply asking for the wrong things.

Has anyone else gone through something like this after marriage, and how did you handle it?

I’m planning my first South America trip and would love some help stress-testing the route and timing. I’ll be traveling **mid-January to mid-April** and trying to balance cities, beaches, and hiking.

**Current rough plan (very flexible):**

* **Brazil:** São Paulo → Northeastern beaches (would love a week surfing!) 
* **Argentina:** Buenos Aires
* **Patagonia:** Hiking in **Argentina / Chile** (Torres del Paine, El Chaltén ??? )
* **Chile:** Atacama Desert
* **Colombia:** \~1 month (Medellín, Caribbean coast, coffee region?)
* **Peru:** Lima + Cusco / Sacred Valley

**About me:**

* Backpacking style: hostels, buses, occasional flights
* Budget: mid-range backpacker (not shoestring, not luxury)
* Interests: hiking, landscapes, food, culture
* I’m solo and don’t mind moving fast *if* it makes sense season-wise

**Main questions I’d love help with:**

1. **Does this route make sense for Jan–Apr weather-wise?** Anything here I’m hitting at the *worst* possible time?
2. **Order of countries:** What would you do *first* vs *last* given seasons?
3. **Patagonia timing:** When is the best time I should realistically be there for hiking?
4. **Brazil NE beaches:** Which areas are best Jan–Feb for backpackers (and not crazy expensive)?
5. **Am I cramming too much in 3 months?** What would *y*ou cut or extend?
6. Anything obvious I’m **missing or overlooking** (visa timing, altitude adjustment, long travel days, etc.)?

Not looking for a perfect itinerary — more interested in **hard-earned lessons, route tweaks, and “I wish I’d known this before” advice.**

1pp78p5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TattvaMentalHealth/comments/1pp78p5/insomnia_sleep_doesnt_disappear_it_waits_for_the/,"Insomnia : Sleep doesn’t disappear, it waits for the body to feel safe","Let me start with something curious.

Do animals don’t have insomnia? LOL no right...

They don’t lie awake replaying conversations, they do not feel exhausted but unable to sleep and definingly don't scroll at midnight.

And coming to us humans that's what we do everynight.

So here’s the question for you all...  
If sleep were purely mental, why would the body be tired but the mind still alert?

**Because, sleep doesn’t begin in the mind. It begins in the body.**

In classical Ayurveda, sleep (**Nidra)** arrives when the body feels safe, noruished, cozy and complete for the day.

Animals sleep easily because their bodies follow rhythm.

Humans, however override rhythm.

We eat late. We work late.  
Our nervous system is stimulated until the last moment we try to fall sleep  
and then expect body to suddenly shut down on command.

But, unfortunately the body doesn’t work that way.

That’s insomnia.

Not anxiety. Not overthinking. Not a weak mind.

Body that never received the signal: “You’re done for the day.”

So what is the solution here... prepare for sleep hours before bedtime

Starts with some micro changes...

I am not asking to stop the coffee all together but stop it before 2PM if not at least by 3PM.

Eat easily digestible lite meals, say no to processed food. You should feel energetic and pleasant after a meal. 

Do hip opening yoga which releases emotional trauma from body morning or evening. Or any form of exercise will do. If its too hard a walk would do as well.

Breathing exercises simple anuloma viloma ( alternate nostril breathing) 2-5 mins to begin with.

Stop being on phone 2 hours before sleep. If possible time limit the exposure to electronics.

Read something relaxing or focus on spending time with kids or spend at least few mins on your hobby which doesn't involve electronics.

These changes tell body... “You can stand down now.”

And when the body powers down…sleep arrives on its own.

Because sleep is not something we *do*. It’s something the body **allows**.

Give it a week to see the changes. Micro changes matter they show sustained results.

Make your body resistant to stress by treating with love and respect.

Where do these phantom” chats come from?,"I’m asking this mostly out of curiosity and to understand how Gemini works internally. I’m not very technical, so I’d appreciate explanations in simple terms if possible.

Over the past few weeks, I noticed that Gemini occasionally displayed short messages inside the chat interface that look exactly like something I typed, but I didn’t. There was no active conversation, no accidental input, and sometimes I wasn’t even using Gemini at all.

Before assuming anything serious, I ruled out account access by another person, i Changed my Google password multiple times
– Enabled 2FA
– Checked active sessions and devices
– Revoked third-party access
– No security alerts or suspicious logins
– In some cases, no physical access to my phone at all

Because of that, the idea that someone I know did this no longer makes sense.

Examples of the messages Gemini showed:

– “Coffee with menthol”
– “Your phone is extremely dirty”
– “I was calling you and you didn’t answer”
– “Illustrations”
– “The flag ceremony at \[my school\]”

The last one is what made me stop thinking about who did this and start asking how.
I attended that ceremony the same day, but I didn’t search it on Google, didn’t add it to Calendar, didn’t write notes, and only mentioned it very briefly in a couple of personal messages. Yet hours later, Gemini displayed that event as text inside the chat.

I understand that Google can infer context from different signals, and I’m not claiming direct spying. What I don’t understand is:

How does inferred context end up appearing as a chat message that looks like something I wrote?

Is this: some kind of automatic summary?
–Assistant or Discover context being verbalized?
–a UX issue where system-generated text is shown as user input?

Even if the inference is correct, presenting it in a chat format feels confusing and misleading from a user perspective.

Has anyone else seen Gemini show messages they never typed?
And if so, does anyone know how or why this happens?

I have done this trip with both my iX and my i4 in the past.  But this roadtrip was different.  Having NACS access and an adapter ready-to-go made driving an EV no different than driving an ICE vehicle to me.

Having NACS access gave me a range and charging confidence I never had.  I was able to drive the car and just drive the car.  I did not keep an eye on range or efficiency at all.  As such, the stress created by range anxiety was eliminated.  I got to just enjoy the drive, it was amazing.  I drove with the flow of traffic on I 15, about 80-85 versus nursing the car along, coasting, regen going downhill, etc. to get maximum range and efficiency.  I just enjoyed the drive, the car and the scenery.  

When I arrived in Ventura County, I stopped at the Camarillo Premium Outlets to charge while I grabbed a coffee and wife grabbed an Acai bowl.  Unfortunately, 2 of the 8 EA chargers were not working and showed as available in the BMW Nav.  There was a queue that had formed.  Normally, I'd have to wait and change some plans because of the delay.  But in this case, Tesla V4 superchargers were in the same parking lot.  Plugged in, grabbed coffee and Acai Bowl and no change of plans, no stress.  Again amazing.

I was gifted the Nespresso Verturo Next Costco Bundle in October. However, after regular use for over 2 and a half months, it has proven to be rather expensive at almost $2 a pod after taxes, which with our usage would be over $450-600 a year in pods. 

I know that Costco offers one Starbucks Nespresso case with 64 pods for around $74, but we didn’t like those flavors and prefer some of the flavors the Nespresso company makes. The Verturo pods are also patented for the next few years, so there is no third party options that can bring down the cost. The Next I’ve heard has longevity issues, but the machine doesn’t fall under Costco’s 90 day policy.

This week, I bought the K-Crema to try out as I know it’s Keurig’s attempt to compete with Nespresso. I know Keurigs primarily make drip coffee, and the crema in the Keurig is not genuine so you’ll never get that exact espresso creaminess or feel, but the cost effectiveness is a plus. I understand there are high quality K Cup pods, as well as run of the mill one and done pods for when you just need a fix, and there are plenty of options at warehouse stores like Costco. I tried out the Kirkland breakfast roast on pressure mode double shot, and didn’t enjoy how watered down it was, but the “espresso-style” is more prominent and better tasting in medium and darker roasts like Kirkland Pacific Bold or Cafe Bustelo. 

Overall, the taste is not as rich as a Nespresso, but what is driving me to keep the Keurig is the fact that I primarily make iced milk drinks and the cost helps for our coffee drinking habits. What is driving me to keep the Nespresso is the quality of taste, but not the machine itself.

Husband bought very expensive skin cream when I asked him not to.,"I was at the mall with my husband when a saleswoman approached selling some kind of skin cream for like $150 for a few ounces. I tried to say no thank you and move on but he wanted to try it, and the saleswoman rubbed some cream on me and then peeled it off kind of like Elmer’s glue. She said it was peeling “impurities” off my hand lol. I tried to be polite and say, that’s nice, but no thank you. Then my husband offered to buy me some, and I repeated, no thank you, I don’t think a tiny tub of supposedly exfoliating cream is worth $150. The saleswoman was very… saleswomany at my husband about the cream and ignored my protests, and my husband gave in, bought TWO, and handed the bag to me smiling like he’d done me a favor. 

We struggle to make rent at the end of every month, and imo it’s mostly because of impulsive big purchases like this. $300 for skin cream. I told him, again, I don’t want the cream, and I’m annoyed that he spent $300 on it “for me” after I’d asked him not to, especially knowing how tight money is. Especially knowing how angry and confrontational he gets about the bills when they’re due, too, highlighting things I’ve bought, like a $12 can of coffee. 

He got upset, accused me of being ungrateful, and pouted for the rest of the day. He left the skin cream in the bathroom with my stuff, I ignored it for a few days, and he ended up gifting it to his mother instead. To this day he insists I was being unreasonable and that I should have just accepted the gift. Meanwhile, we’re still struggling financially and he’s still making big purchases and getting angry when I protest, or even ask simple questions about the purchases.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I’ve been on \~15 first dates this year and keep hitting the same wall.

The beginning is usually fine:

* greeting, ordering coffee
* light small talk about work or the day
* nothing amazing, but not awkward

Then once the initial small talk runs out, things fall apart.

There’s a pause.  
I panic a bit.  
I ask something generic.  
They give a short answer.  
And instead of building on it, my brain just… stops.

The rest of the date feels like polite damage control. We finish the coffee, say “this was nice,” and that’s usually it.

What’s confusing is that this doesn’t happen elsewhere:

* I’m fine over text
* fine with friends
* fine at work

It’s specifically this moment on dates. It honestly makes me wonder if this is just me, or if other people hit a similar wall.

So I’m curious:

**If you’ve struggled with dates before, where does it usually go wrong for you?**  
At the start? After small talk? When things get quiet? When trying to go deeper?

And if you’ve gotten past it**, what actually helped, in practice, not just in theory?**

The kitchen doesn’t care how long you’ve been there. It doesn’t care about loyalty or how many shifts you’ve survived on fumes. What it cares about is what you deliver when the order fires and what happens when you leave the line.

A Sous Chef who runs tight service is valuable. A Chef who runs tight service and understands why the business lives or dies is indispensable.

In 2026, the gap between keeping a station clean and leading a kitchen has never been wider. The restaurants still standing after the past two years are the ones where leadership did more than manage. They led. They thought like operators. They built culture on purpose, not on accident. They built themselves into the story the industry needed to tell.

If you’re sitting in a Sous Chef role right now, looking up at the Chef’s station, you need to know three specific things that separate the people who get promoted from the people who plateau.

**1. Learn to Read a P&L Like You Read a Ticket**

You can be technically flawless in a kitchen and still get passed over. The reason is simple that Owners and General Managers promote people who reduce risk, not just people who reduce stress.

A Sous Chef’s job is to execute. A Chef’s job is to make the kitchen profitable.

The gap between those two sentences is where most Sous Chefs fail to make the move.

Start here. Every week, your food cost is sitting in a spreadsheet somewhere. That number isn’t just a metric. It is the health of the business written in dollars. If you don’t know what your food cost was last week, what it should be this week, and why it might shift next month, you’re not yet thinking like a Chef.

The number that matters most is your cost of goods sold (COGS). When a restaurant operates successfully, COGS runs between 28% and 35% of total sales. Below that, you’re bleeding money into waste or bad ordering. Above that, you’re selling food at a loss while pretending to be profitable. Until you can calculate it without being asked, you’re still a glorified shift lead.

Learn the formula. Understand it in your bones. Beginning inventory plus purchases minus ending inventory, divided by sales. That is the language of operators. Start running the numbers yourself. Ask your Chef or Manager to walk you through the monthly food cost breakdown. Ask which menu items are pulling down your margins. Ask which suppliers are costing more than they should. Most Chef-level leaders will respect this question because it shows you’re not just thinking about getting through service. You’re thinking about survival.

Next, understand menu engineering. Every dish on your menu has a cost attached to it. One day, you’ll build a menu, and when you do, the dishes that cost you the most to produce should generate the highest revenue. This isn’t philosophy. This is arithmetic. A steak dish should always outperform a vegetable dish on the bottom line. If your vegetarian options are generating more profit than your center-of-the-plate proteins, your menu is broken, and your business is leaking money. Walk through this with your leadership. Understand which dishes are carrying the load and which ones are luxuries you can afford.

The third number is labor cost. You already manage scheduling by instinct. Now learn to manage it by economics. If your labor runs over 30% of sales on a given week, the kitchen is overstaffed or under-producing. Both are problems. Both are solvable by someone who has thought about them deliberately.

This isn’t accounting. This is survival. Any Chef who can’t explain why these three numbers matter is cooking blind. You’ll be promoted by someone who understands that you’re not. When you walk into a hiring meeting three years from now, and someone asks about your approach to food cost, your answer will determine whether you get the job.

Tim Condon, an executive Chef and restaurant owner, puts it plainly: “You’re not a Chef until you are able to monetize your field.” That isn’t cynicism. That is the actual line.

**2. Stop Managing Fear. Start Managing Energy.**

A Sous Chef manages tasks. A Chef manages people. The difference feels small until you live it.

Your current job is to see what needs to be done and make sure it gets done on time. You move through the kitchen, checking stations, confirming tickets are being hit, redirecting flow when someone goes sideways. This is management. It works because people are terrified of disappointing you. It’s not sustainable. It‘s not leadership.

In 2026, the restaurants hemorrhaging talent are the ones that run on fear. The ones keeping their teams are running on culture. Culture starts with one person: the Chef.

Every cook in your kitchen has a breaking point. They have many consecutive twelve-hour shifts before they stop showing up. They have a threshold for how many times they can get yelled at before they hand you their apron. They have a day when the money stops mattering, and they walk. Your job, if you want to be a Chef, is to keep that from happening by managing the energy in the room, not the compliance on the line.

This sounds soft. It’s not. It’s the hardest skill you’ll develop.

Energy is contagious. When you walk onto the line disheveled, frustrated, already exhausted by 4 pm, every cook in that room adjusts downward. They know you’re checked out. They know the night is going to hurt. When you walk in steady, focused, calm, with a clear picture of what matters today, they follow that rhythm. They cook faster. They make fewer mistakes. They stay longer.

Building a kitchen culture where staff remain engaged and motivated requires deliberate leadership choices. The Restaurant HQ research reveals that happy employees are 12% more productive than unhappy ones, and that restaurants proactively addressing employee stress see lower turnover, fewer workplace accidents, and higher overall productivity. This isn’t sentiment. This is profit math.

Start practicing this now, as a Sous Chef. During tomorrow’s service, don’t move through the kitchen correcting mistakes from a place of frustration. Move through with a steady voice. When something goes wrong, pause for two seconds before you respond. Let your body tell you whether you’re reacting or leading. Then speak. Ask the cook what happened before you tell them what should happen. Listen to the answer. This changes everything.

During the next stressful service, watch what happens when the line cook on the grill and the one on sauté start pushing back on each other about timing. The instinct is to blow the whistle and separate them. Instead, step into it. Acknowledge both of them. Say something like “I know the grill is hot right now and you need the plate to land perfectly.” Then turn to sauté. “I know you’re worried about the timing.” Now bring them together around a solution, not a blame. Find a hand to help. Refocus them on the shared goal. After service, bring them back. Don’t let the tension fester.

This is what leadership looks like. It’s harder than yelling. It’s worth infinitely more.

The restaurants operating at scale in 2026 are the ones where the executive team isn’t constantly replacing line staff because they left. Turnover costs money. Retention builds margins. The Chef who understands this becomes indispensable not because they cook better than everyone else, but because they keep the people who cook around.

**3. Build a Visible Reputation Beyond Your Current Kitchen**

The last barrier between a Sous Chef and a Chef position is visibility. Not just in your restaurant. In the industry.

Owners and General Managers don’t promote people they have never heard of outside the kitchen. The restaurants that promote from within do it because they already know the candidate can perform in front of people who matter. That happens through reputation, not accident.

In 2026, if you’re not building a personal brand, you’re leaving money on the table and opportunities on the floor.

This doesn’t mean becoming an influencer. It doesn’t mean chasing likes or building a following. It means becoming known for something specific and tangible in your community and industry.

Start with a clear idea of what you’re building. Are you a Chef focused on sustainability and zero waste? Are you specializing in a specific cuisine? Are you building something around technique or an ingredient? Pick a thing. Own it. Stop trying to be everything.

Then make it visible. Host a pop-up in a parking lot or a pop-up restaurant for a weekend. Cook at local events. Write about your food philosophy on a blog or even a simple LinkedIn post. Share images of what you’re building. Tell the story of why you chose a particular ingredient or technique. Research shows that Chefs with active social media presence and strategic visibility in their communities generate substantially higher engagement and attract stronger talent pools.

The second part is trickier, but you have to actually do the work. Post thoughtfully about what you’re building, but then build it. If you talk about seasonal cooking, make sure your sourcing is actually seasonal. If you talk about staff retention, make sure your team isn’t burning out. Inconsistency is a reputation killer. Follow through on every promise you make publicly.

The third piece is relationship building. Go to industry events. Have dinner at other restaurants. Connect with other Chefs, sommeliers, farmers, journalists. When a position opens at a restaurant you respect, you’ll already know someone there. When an investor is looking for a Chef/Partner, they’ll hear your name from people in the room.

This sounds like networking. It’s different. It’s a genuine connection with people in the industry who do work that matters to you. You eat their food. You ask real questions. You offer help when you can. Over the years, this creates a network of people who know what you’re capable of and would work with you if the opportunity existed.

Chefs with strategic visibility operate from different grounds. They have agency. They have options. The work happens before the title changes. It happens while you’re still Sous Chef. It happens in a pop-up on a Saturday. It happens in a post about your process. It happens in a conversation with someone at another restaurant where you talk about what excites you, not just what you do.

By the time you’re ready to step into a Chef role, your name should already be circulating in places that matter. People should be asking about you. That doesn’t happen from cooking perfect plates in a closed kitchen. It happens from building a visible identity as someone who thinks about food, people, and restaurants differently.

**What This Actually Means Tomorrow**

You’re running service tonight. The walk-in is stocked, the tickets are going to fly, someone will probably have a meltdown. Three specific things change about how you move through that shift.

**One:** You ask about the food cost from last week. Not aggressively. Not with attitude. A genuine question: “What was our food cost?” If no one knows immediately, you know something. If someone knows, you listen to why the number landed where it did. This is where learning starts.

**Two:** During the rush, when something breaks, or someone goes sideways, you pause. You don’t yell. You acknowledge what’s happening, then solve it with a clear voice. You set the tone. You watch what the room does when you stay calm.

**Three:** This week, you reach out to one Chef or Operator you respect and ask them to get coffee. Or you start planning a pop-up. Or you write something down about what excites you about food and post it somewhere honest. You make one move toward building your name beyond your current four walls.

The Chef position in 2026 won’t go to the most talented cook. It’ll go to the person who has already started acting like a Chef before the title was official. Start now.

The restaurants running in 2026 aren’t the ones with the prettiest plates. They’re the ones led by people who learned to think like operators while still cooking like artisans. If you want to move into that chair, start acting as if you belong there now.

There's this one case I came across almost 10 years ago, never felt right after it. Started on the outskirts near the exit roads, a cold road with the only warmth coming from my coffee cup and an officers cigarette smouldering on the side of the road.

""Deputies get your shit together, this is a crime scene, stop contaminating the place for fucks sake."" Contempt for fools was the only thing felt on my voice.

My deputies held no place in their hearts for me, especially considering they think I'm a nepo baby. I earned this position with solid police work and these lazy fucks can't seem to get it in their heads that just coming in for a paycheck isn't enough when it comes to this job.

""Oh I'm so sorry lord, please don't smite me with a citation and week's paid suspension oh no! Hehehe."" That prick McCready has gotta be the most annoying deputy under my wing. Sucks too, next to me he's pretty damn good at his job, and he was next in line for the Sheriff position.

""At least pretend to act like a professional McCready, there's a corpse here.""

""Looks like roadkill boss man, cut and dry.""

""Ever seen an animal leave that kinda scar? That deep and sharp?"" As I kneeled down I gestured to the scar behind the buck's neck.

""Shit how'd I miss that?""

""Maybe less asshole, and more police work  and you just might have caught it....... Hmmm looks to big for a bear to small for a wolf."" McCready and another deputy, Jones, stepped over handed me a pair of plastic gloves.

""So what do you think it is? Cougar?"" Jones inquired, one of the only female deputies I have and she was a weird one. City woman who came here about a year before these particular accidents.

""No doesn't seem like that either, this is something different."" I pulled a large feather about the size of my arm, from the wound. Black with red streaks across it.

""What the fuck, you ever seen a feather that large?"" 

""McCready call the forensics team and-"" A loud screech interrupted me and before I could turn to see it, the deputy's pickup was set ablaze. The subsequent explosion sent me, the 2 deputies and the buck corpse flying, at least 10 yards down the road.

I looked up as I heard another scream, followed by a gurgle and a splash of blood pushing itself onto my stubbled face. I looked over in the smoke to see Jones with the similar scar starting from the bottom of her left breast up to her right chin.

""Shit! McCready call the ambulance now! McCready wh-"" McCready finally quiet had a piece of shrapnel in his gut and was holding it tight as to not bleed out.

I held one hand on Jones's neck and another on the walkie talkie on my hip. I pressed the button on the side and tried to keep my voice steady.

""McCready hang in there! Dispatch I need a fucking ambulance on exit 3, I also need backup! Fucking backup we're under fire!! Jones stay with me dammit!"" I drop the radio and put both hands on Jones's neck.

An uneasy feeling came over me as I heard a weird twitching noise, I looked over at the deer or were the corpse should have been laying. My heartbeat raced and my blood went cold as I saw it staring at me, staring into my soul. Its eyes they looked alive, like it hadn't been dead, the eerie feeling never left me.

I was frozen, it was just there laying down staring at me, then within seconds I heard the scream again. I looked up and saw.... Well I still don't know what I saw, but it was a bit bigger than a bear, feathers seemingly hanging from its arms. It had a head the size of a pumpkin and it's body as pale as it was had feathers all over it's bulky form. It's teeth we're about the size of my forearm, and covered in blood.

It lunged down from the air picked up the corpse with it's talon-like hands and flew off with it. 

These moments in-between stunned shock and macabre moments Jones slipped away and McCready leaned up against my truck as I heard sirens on their way.

I looked off in the morning dew and saw the beast flying away with it's bounty 

""What the fuck?! What was that?"" McCready spoke still bleeding from his wound.

""I have no fucking clue.""

It screeched one more time as it flew towards the forest.
