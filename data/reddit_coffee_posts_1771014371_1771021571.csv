1r4315k,https://i.redd.it/jzawz37a7cjg1.png,"I got tired of productivity apps feeling like data entry jobs, so I built a day planner that actually works. [ADHD-Friendly]","Hey everyone 👋🏻,

I’ve tried almost every productivity app out there. The cycle is always the same: download it, spend hours setting it up, and then abandon it a week (most of the times say day), later coz logging tasks feels like a second job.

I realized I had a few specific problems that no single app was solving for me:

\- I couldn't visualize my day. List views are boring and calendar blocks are rigid. I wanted to see my day at a glance.

\- Logging tasks is a friction point. I don't want to tap 5 buttons to add ""Buy milk.""

\- I kept missing things. Tasks would get buried in sub-menus or different days.

\- Context was missing. I’d plan a huge outdoor run only to realize it’s raining.

So I built Pala to fix this. Here is how it solves those issues:

1. The Circular Timeline

I built a custom view (CircularTimeline) that visualizes your entire day on a 24-hour clock face. You can see your free slots, overlaps, and current status in one single, friendly view. It handles task overlaps intelligently so you can see when you're overbooked without it looking cluttered.

2. AI Planning (To avoid manual logging)

I added an AI feature where you just dump your brain. Type ""I need to finish the report, go to the gym at 5, and call mom"", even you can do it for future like ""Plan my weekends and make them health centric and some entertainment'. The app understands that text and plans your day for you automatically. It’s the feature that finally stopped me from avoiding task logging.

3. Never Miss a Task

I created a dedicated home view that combines the timeline with a smart list. It’s designed so nothing slips through the cracks—you can manage, reschedule, or complete tasks right from the dashboard. Or simply ask AI feature to plan all the missed tasks to my current day.

4. Context-Aware Calendar

The calendar doesn't just show dots for events; it pulls in real weather data. Now when I plan my week, I can see if it’s going to rain on Tuesday before I schedule that hike.

5. True Focus Mode

To stop getting distracted, I built a dedicated Focus Mode. It’s a clean, full-screen timer that tracks your progress and blocks out the noise so you can actually get work done.

6. Productivity Insights

Finally, I wanted to know if I was actually improving. The app tracks your completion rates and gives you detailed insights into your productivity trends over time.

7. Notifications.

Yes. Reminder is needed before the task starts.

I built this because I needed it, but I’d love to hear what you think.

I'm sick of being so negative about people who mildly annoy me, my own work, receiving complements, the lot; it obviously stops people from wanting to deal with me and I want to change, truly. I am nearing the end of my university degree (animation, as pointless as it gets in the real world I'm afraid), and have only just scheduled in with this team -- a friend has told me its basicaally therapy but 1 session a month which isn't going to be enough, probably have to shill a lot for more but we'll see.

Over my uni ""life"" I have done nothing of note, I *had* a girlfriend, a loving and caring girlfriend who I dumped because I was scared I meant nothing to her. We reconciled after the fact, became better friends and the possibility of getting back together was in the air; I wanted to, I ***want*** to but as of a week ago she's decided its best for us to go no-contact because I kept offering and asking and trying to understand why she pulled away from me over the past few months. I am struggling to cope, its not been a full week and I have no *real* friends to talk to. I have 2 friends in class, we message over Instagram but I have done barely anything with them outside of class; I've not been in the position to, invited, or otherwise. I quite literally have nobody to talk to about the aforementioned because we're not even really *that* level of friends. They say they'll take me on nights out with them now that I'm finally living closer, but the waiting is killing me off. I just want friends.

  
I'm considering joining societies at university, ones I've avoided for knowing I'm a bit iffy with 1 or 2 members of -- I've thrown potential friends away, and now only have all of about 4 months to scrape something together. I feel so completely and utterly *nothing*, I get home from my extremely low 2 days a week of uni and just go hollow. I'll cry over the slightest thought of my ex (whom I know has a crush on another guy), whether its the fact I've shunted myself out of her life, that she's socialising and happy, or just that we could've been something more. I have no choice but to wait out the no contact, although I hope the wellbeing team might encourage me to ""invite her for a coffee and a talk"" even though I know they won't and she wouldn't want to. All I've done for the past month is cry about this woman, I truly love her and every action I offered was to try and be someone to her again. I'm just confused, so painfully confused and lost. There's ***1*** society that I'd *truly* want to join, but I can't; not only is she in it, the man she has a crush on is on the committee for the society. Last time she saw me in the shop she apparently almost had a panic attack.

I just can't, I'm lost and have wasted my time at university and am now trying to do everything crammed into a short period. I want to become a better man for myself, for my future, but I can't imagine a future without her.

**Rule W5A.1** - More often they are that one single thing.

**Rule W5B** - Telling them otherwise will only anger them.

#### Rule W9 - If a document fails to print, users will keep trying just to make sure it prints. See *Rule 30C*.

**Rule W9A** - The true importance of the documents they are trying to print will be inversely proportional to the fit they are throwing. See *Rule 30C*.

**Rule W18B** - The longer it takes to report it, the more urgent the user will claim that it is.

**Rule W18C** - The time it takes to fix the issue is inversely proportional to the amount of time it took to report it.

#### Rule W21 - Users will believe their desire for something to happen is sufficient for it to happen.

#### Rule W29 - Users will claim something can't be done, even if you are doing it.

**Rule W29A** - Users will claim that something impossible worked before.

**Rule W29B** - Despite all evidence to the contrary, users will insist that things having worked yesterday means they must also be working today.

1r42olf,https://i.redd.it/ioordaos4cjg1.png,"I got tired of productivity apps feeling like data entry jobs, so I built a day planner that actually works. [ADHD-Friendly]","Hey everyone 👋🏻,

I’ve tried almost every productivity app out there. The cycle is always the same: download it, spend hours setting it up, and then abandon it a week (most of the times say day), later coz logging tasks feels like a second job.

I realized I had a few specific problems that no single app was solving for me:

\- I couldn't visualize my day. List views are boring and calendar blocks are rigid. I wanted to see my day at a glance.

\- Logging tasks is a friction point. I don't want to tap 5 buttons to add ""Buy milk.""

\- I kept missing things. Tasks would get buried in sub-menus or different days.

\- Context was missing. I’d plan a huge outdoor run only to realize it’s raining.

So I built Pala to fix this. Here is how it solves those issues:

1. The Circular Timeline

I built a custom view (CircularTimeline) that visualizes your entire day on a 24-hour clock face. You can see your free slots, overlaps, and current status in one single, friendly view. It handles task overlaps intelligently so you can see when you're overbooked without it looking cluttered.

2. AI Planning (To avoid manual logging)

I added an AI feature where you just dump your brain. Type ""I need to finish the report, go to the gym at 5, and call mom"", even you can do it for future like ""Plan my weekends and make them health centric and some entertainment'. The app understands that text and plans your day for you automatically. It’s the feature that finally stopped me from avoiding task logging.

3. Never Miss a Task

I created a dedicated home view that combines the timeline with a smart list. It’s designed so nothing slips through the cracks—you can manage, reschedule, or complete tasks right from the dashboard. Or simply ask AI feature to plan all the missed tasks to my current day.

4. Context-Aware Calendar

The calendar doesn't just show dots for events; it pulls in real weather data. Now when I plan my week, I can see if it’s going to rain on Tuesday before I schedule that hike.

5. True Focus Mode

To stop getting distracted, I built a dedicated Focus Mode. It’s a clean, full-screen timer that tracks your progress and blocks out the noise so you can actually get work done.

6. Productivity Insights

Finally, I wanted to know if I was actually improving. The app tracks your completion rates and gives you detailed insights into your productivity trends over time.

7. Notifications.

Yes. Reminder is needed before the task starts.

I built this because I needed it, but I’d love to hear what you think.

They would go away than come back again a year after. I had tried advil, Tylenol, Motrin, Tylenol with codeine and nothing would work. I just usually sleep it off. The pain was so bad I would rate it 10/10 for me.

After few years of this i went to emerg. I remembered the nurse gave me 1200mg of Tylenol and Advil and still no effect. The Dr came sent me for a CT scan made sure it wasn't an aneurysm or anything serious. Afterwards told me it was cluster headache gave me some O2 and finally the pain eased up. I was so happy to find relief. Went to my family dr back than just told me wait it go away. Went to a pain clinic and more or less the same thing since O2 was helping.

For some reason it went away and I thought It was in the past. A month ago after like 10 years without any incident I started to get the same pain behind the eye that would give me an indication the CH was coming. I was hoping it was nothing, I was wrong. The CH had came back. Sometimes I would get 1 or 2 per day. Some really rare day I had 3. Some days I was lucky and they never came. The pain this time around doesn't feel like those very very intense one but still quite painful sometimes. Lot of times I would say 5/10 but sometimes it was like a 7/10. 

Few weeks ago I was just browsing around. I've always used Reddit but let see what happens if I search CH in Reddit. Was shocked and grateful to see a whole subreddit for this. Read O2 was used to combat CH like my ER doc said. Than saw other options like taking shots to prevent them. One of the other option that caught my eye was caffeine via red bull or coffee. 

I was never a smoker, I would drink alcohol rarely only for social gatherings. Coffee occasionally to wake up for work , was not a every day thing. So a week or two ago I would get breakfast that included coffee. I would drink it and my CH would never manifest. One day I'm at home and was sleeping in and could feel the pain behind my eye again. Made my self a black coffee and drank it. The initial pain went away and I didn't get the full CH. I don't really want to drink coffee everyday. I've seen some people that would get headache withdrawal when drinking a coffee everyday than stop one day.

Small note before starting, we don’t often travel to all inclusives. We’re more into boutique hotels. However, we needed a week of rest, with zero planning.

When: First week of Feb.2026

Price paid: 2,200 CAD per person

**Hotel (room, beach and facilities)**  
• We were in building 11. Perfect location in my opinion. One minute from the beach and one minute from the bar and pool. Very practical day to day. It’s worth requesting buildings 10, 11, 12, 8 or 9.  
• Super nice room, clean and functional.  
• The hotel is very well maintained and up to date.  
• They use very strong fragrances in the lobby bathroom, at the spa and at Mike’s Coffee. It’s almost suffocating.  
• The property is beautiful, with lots of really cute little animals.  
• The beach is gorgeous and you can walk nearly two kilometres.  
• The pools aren’t very nice. Very large and cold. They’re missing a little something.  
• Great tennis court, three courts in total. They lend rackets and balls for free.  
• The hotel isn’t noisy in the evening, since the lobby is far enough from the room buildings.  
• The themed evenings are fun. The silent disco was the best evening for us.  
• For group sports, there is no yoga.

**Hotel location**  
• As mentioned above, we’re not used to all inclusives and we regret not choosing a hotel closer to an urban centre so we could go out and explore on foot. Taxis cost 40 USD one way to Playa Del Carmen and more than 120 USD one way to Tulum.

**Restaurants and food**  
• The buffet was our highlight ahah. Very nice variety of options at all times of the day. Nice salad bar with microgreens, ceviche bar, bagel and smoked salmon bar. There is no shortage of choices and the taste is good.  
• The à la carte restaurants are okay, nothing more. They use a huge amount of low quality butter with a very strong aftertaste, so everything ends up tasting the same. The meats lacked flavour and everything was very greasy. We don’t really understand the praise about the à la carte restaurants on different review sites.  
• The little Mike’s Coffee is very pleasant. The lattes are as good as the ones in our Montreal coffee shops, which is great!!  
• During the day, there is a pizza stand near the pool, super practical.  
• Alcohol free option: a few classic mocktails and Heineken 0.0.

**Clientele**  
• Average age between 50 and 65, very festive. It was literally an adult daycare. People were not very chic, it lacked a bit of refinement. No judgement, but we’ve stayed at other all inclusives where the clientele was a bit more polished. Lots of English Canadians, Americans and Russians.

We were looking for sun, relaxation and zero planning and that’s exactly what we got. Would we recommend it to friends? Probably not, simply because we think the location wasn’t optimal for our personal tastes, plus the crowd.  But you know, it’s very subjective for everyone. : )

Time for a restock soon, and I’m having a bit of a dilemma. I’m a big fan of strong coffee Ispirazione Napoli is my absolute go-to for espresso.

My top choice is Inspirazione Napoli & Stockholm Lungo untill now.

For my daily ""regular"" cup, I usually reach for the Stockholm Lungo. I love the flavor profile, and in my opinion, it has the best and thickest crema of all the lungos.

I’ve tried the Cape Town Lungo (the ""strongest"" on paper), but to be honest, I found it very watery compared to the Stockholm. Not my thing at all. Generally, anything under intensity 8 doesn't really do it for me. Now I’m curious about the Master Origin Indonesia. How does the crema compare to the Stockholm? Has anyone tested both extensively and picked a winner for flavor and body.

Also, a quick question: do any of you use espresso capsules as a lungo (or as an Americano)? I’m wondering if certain strong espresso pods actually produce a better body or thicker crema than the standard lungo capsules.

If you have any other ""top tier"" suggestions that fit the powerful Napoli vibe and the full body of the Stockholm, I’d love to hear them!

I live with my mom and dad. They have been together for almost 20 years and the whole time my mom has been putting up with insane behavior. My dad is a recovered meth addict, and a felon. He has been out of jail for about 8 years now. 

He is usually very relaxed and chill but his mean spikes come out of nowhere about once or twice a year, usually triggered by something small. He was sitting on the couch a couple days ago just watching TV. He had a cup on the coffee table and my dog bumped it and it spilt on the floor. Not a lot maybe 2 TBSP worth of pop, not a big deal. He got up and was very angry. He balled his fist up and ran up to my dog saying he was going to punch my dog in the head for spilling his pop. I got in front of him because my dog is my family. And I told him it was just a spill and that the dog didn't mean to do it. He grabbed my arm really hard, left a bruise and nail marks in my arm. So I pushed him back. He then threatened to kill my dog, and said if I didn't shut the f\* up that I was going to get punched too. He stormed off all angry slamming doors and acting reckless. I then saw him about 30 minutes later sharpening an axe. 

This is not the first time or the worst thing he has done to me and my mom. But this is where I have become fed up. I turn 18 this summer and finally feel like I can help my mom do something about it. I feel like I am constantly walking on eggshells around him. My mom told me she was afraid to go to bed that night because she doesn't know how far he is willing to go. I am sick of living like this. My mom is the bread winner and I asked her why she didn't leave him a long time ago. And she said it's because he will come and find us no matter what, and she's afraid that if we leave he will do something really bad to us.  

Any sort of advice would be great. I will answer any and all questions. 

I can't live like this any longer. And I can't stand seeing my mom deal with it either. She deserves so much better and she knows it. we're scared.",1,1771019951.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False

I often still cry because I miss her so much. I find it interesting that most of my treasured memories that pop into my head are after she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2015. Sure, I remember other fun times with me, my twin sister, and mom, like when mom would constantly hug me or say ""I love you"" and I would get annoyed as a teenager (oh, how I miss that today!) or when the three of us would laugh over silliness that no one else got. The memories that bring me to tears, though, happened in the last 7 years of her life, while we were fighting Alzheimer's. This is when we felt most connected, and I wouldn't change it for the world.

Growing up, my twin sister, Lisa, and I lived with our single mother, who always said, ""I won't get married until you girls are out on your own."" We did not like that! It felt like she was always in our business, and we just wanted her to ""get a life"". I credit my mom's tenacity and never-ending love, as both our mother and father, for my confidence and ability to love unconditionally. She was my rock, my mentor, my safety net. Our father left us, never to be seen again, at the age of 11. Mom never asked him for help or money, and I wonder if that was the agreement between them so he'd stay away. He was a piece of work!

Mom was my best friend for most of my adult life. I moved to San Francisco in 2008, 3 hours from Watsonville, where my sister and mother built their lives. In my mid 20's, I started calling mom on weekends and doing our weekly ""walk'n talk"" calls. I'd grab coffee, call her, and she would listen to all my dating or friend hardships and give some sage advice that mostly just made me feel loved and heard. Again, being my safety net. My heart broke when she started having difficulty following the stories. That was about 2017 or so. This is when it all changed forever.

Before 2015, the three of us were close-ish. My sister and I have always been close, but my sister and mom were not. They clashed a lot when we were growing up. Mom taught us, family comes first, and we did that for each other, but mom and Lisa really didn't interact other than holidays or when mom watched Lisa's son after school. There was no lack of love there; there just wasn't really a friendship.

After 2015, Lisa naturally took the primary caregiver role since she lived 5 minutes from mom. For this, I am eternally grateful. She handled it with compassion, dignity, and pride. She was there for mom when she needed it most. I see this as a gift to each other. I took the secondary caregiver role, mostly helping virtually and medicare, and cared for mom on Thursdays so Lisa had a full day off. Those Thursdays were some of the hardest days I've ever experienced and most treasured. The picture is from mom's favorite diner. We would have fun! Each week, I would blow the straw's paper wrapper at mom, and she'd be surprised each time, the good and bad of Alzheimer's. We'd laugh a lot!

We were a team, the three of us, until the day mom died. My sister and I cried and laughed through it, and it seemed like mom loved the attention she got from her adult daughters. We bonded, fought, planned, strategized, supported, and connected deeply, all because of Alzheimer's.

I'll end with, caregivers are angels on earth. Your commitment to family is literally saving lives and making them so much better. I am eternally grateful for your work and want you to know you are appreciated.",4,1771019947.0,dementia,1,1.0,False

Things have gotten so bad that I now have my school’s student conduct office, Title IX, and other campus resources involved. She has completely destroyed our friendship and created an extremely hostile living environment.

After winter break, she separated the entire fridge down to the condiments (ketchup, butter, sauces, etc.) because I bought my own groceries and labeled them. I only labeled my food because she was eating everything I bought before I could even eat it.

Later that same day, she also took all of the shared toilet paper (Costco-sized pack) that her family gifted to us. I had provided toilet paper for the entire first semester. She removed her laundry supplies. I provided all of the detergent, which she used most of while I was gone. She also removed decor items. She even started taking kitchen appliances like a countertop skillet. 

That was last month. Fast forward to this morning, I went into the kitchen to make coffee and found that she had taken even more things. This time it was spices like salt and pepper, ingredients like vanilla extract, cooking utensils including cutting boards and measuring cups, aluminum foil, plastic wrap, dish soap, cooking oil, and sponges. She also took all of the paper towels, which were also bought at Costco and gifted to us. 

At this point, it’s clear that this behavior is intentional and retaliatory. I’m already moving out in a couple of weeks and she doesn't know because of how hostile and unpredictable she’s been. She's already damaged and even broke some of my belongings and I'm honestly just ready to get out of here. 

So now I’m wondering WIBTAH if I moved all of my personal items into my bedroom until I leave? I should be getting out of here in 1-2 weeks. That would include my food, my coffee maker, my decor and furniture, and any kitchen items that I personally bought, including the trash can and trash bags. I would not take anything that belongs to her.

I’m not trying to be petty. I just want to protect my belongings and prevent any further retaliation until I can finally leave.",6,1771019905.0,AITAH,8,1.0,False

Brewing-wise, i followed the general recommendation from B&W of grinding at medium fine and brewing with 94 degrees water on my trustee A4z/Pulsar pairing, that to this point has been infallible. The resulting extraction yields were between 19 and 20%.

The bag came from a reseller and arrived having been rested for 5.5 weeks. I would have thought by now it was definitely rested enough to have opened up, and in fact wonder if it was at the opposite end of the scale and had started to noticeably deteriorate... I'm not familiar with how light b&w roast and thus their resting behaviour.

1r42fwh,https://i.redd.it/x3ip2fn63cjg1.jpeg,Popcorn Ceiling Peeling off - Concrete house,"Hello all,

 This is my first time posting here, I have been on an anxiety spiral ever since I found out my house has Asbestos Chrysotile 3 tested via PLM test. I grabbed a small amount of my kitchen popcorn ceiling because it is peeling off and it tested positive, image attached, I searched around this forum and I have seen quite a few similar cases but read nothing close to my store. My house for starters is located in Puerto Rico, concrete and built around 1960s so asbestos is hugely common in houses around that year here, or so I'm told. I have a serious problem in this ceiling and wall, because water is leaking in from my exterior roof but I haven't been able to locate and seal the crack to stop this, so any solution in the interior would be temporary but even that is not possible because when I reached out to asbestos specialists here they told me they can't come, because if they do by law they are required to report my house and then I would have to commit to remove the entire popcorn ceiling, something costing upwards of 50k for my home. I do not have that money and also don't seem to have an available solution that protects me and my wife from this exposure. I have, admittedly irresponsibily looking back now, scraped small patches in other areas on the house where popcorn ceiling simply fell off due to leaks, but I resolved the leaks on the roof so it stopped down.  I also went and bought 3 HEPA air purifiers but I don't know how effective is this, if anything.

I feel like I'm genuinely losing my mind because I don't know what to do, I am thinking of doing it myself and simply scrape cover as much as possible I can on the kitchen and paint over it. I bought a p100 mask, a scraper and some sprayer bottle to mix water/soap and wet scrape this but I don't have the courage to do this because Im genuinely scare. I would also probably have to leave the house for god knows how many days and I can't do that now. I really feel like I am out of options here. Flakes are on the floor or specks fall on my coffee machine or other appliances, I sometimes mist them and try to pinch them up with a paper towel so as to not create dust fibers, but I'm getting this almost daily now. 

What should I do on this situation? I feel that I am continually exposed to this hazardous material. ",1,1771019817.0,asbestoshelp,1,1.0,False

I lay in bed and stare up at the ceiling counting the little popcorn bumps. I groan as I check the time on my twin bell alarm clock. ""Fuck... Work starts in an hour."" I was honestly hoping I could wake up a little earlier so I could get some food in me before I went to work, maybe watch some YouTube. But I settled on scrolling through Instagram reels instead. Scrolling endlessly with mind numbing swiftness, dreading having to pull myself out of bed and get ready. 

A pling notified me from my manager of the address we would be cleaning that day. ""Fuck it."" I said as I threw my phone to the far end of my mattress. I got up, brushed my teeth and jumped in the shower. Throwing on some old dirty jeans from the past 5 days in a row and a black t-shirt with holes around the bottom. 

A quick look in the mirror and ruffling my brown hair and a stupid smile ""you're a wreck"" I thought. I walk out of my laundry covered room and grab my keys off the kitchen table.

I pulled up to the address and saw my coworker John getting all the cleaning supplies out of the back of the van.

""John Manager, what's up man."" I said as I walked up to him. 

""Shut up Will."" John scoffed to himself 

John was a no bulshit kind of guy, grizzled maybe in his early 40's I wouldn't bother asking. He was good company, had his jokes and dry humor. All I cared about was that he was a good manager and coworker. 

He actually got his hands dirty when you needed him and jumped onto any situation to give you tips. Not in a know it all douchey way either, He's a good dude is my point.

""why don't you help me get the hazmat suits out of the truck."" He groaned as he put a massive bucket of bleach onto the concrete.

""Got you, so what's going on up in the apartment? Any word on what we are walking into?"" I said as I rummaged through the van.

""I'm not too sure, all I heard was something happened with the guys teeth and he croaked about a week ago. No one heard from him and they called in a wellness check. Sure enough we are here, so yeah.... Hes dead"" he said with a kind of stare off into the distance and hands on his sides.

""Oh word? He's not alive and breathing? I thought we were here to say hi. Maybe give him a kiss on the cheek or something.""  I said dumbfounded

""Yeah you can go give the cadaver a kiss on the cheek if you want."" John said laughing 

""So where the hell is Arin...it's 10:30... Dude is seriously late every fucking day."" I said noticeably annoyed I threw the 3 hazmat suits onto the pavement next to the bleach.

""Yeah I know he is, he sent me a text I guess his alarm went off late I don't know. I just saw his car pull in so whatever."" He said brushing it off.

""NOT WHATEVER! FUCK THAT DUDE! John, I bust my ass to get here on time every day and that scrawny fuck is always late!!!"" I said throwing my hands up

Arin walked up to the van with his big Osiris shoes and an oversized tap out shirt way too big for his skinny frame. Tall, goofy greasy hair. His breath always smelled like he rolled out of bed and ran out of the door. I Hate this guy. Who the fuck wears tap out shirts and Osiris shoes in 2025. I'm not even sure they make them anymore.

""You guys started unpacking already?"" Arin said with fake concern in his voice clearly trying to cover his ass.

""Uh yuh we did. We started at 10."" I said as I walked by him to grab the respirators out of the van. 

""Arin grab the brooms and mops and get it ready to go up to the apartment and hurry up, I don't feel like being here all night. And before you give me some dumb excuse just get your suit on man. This is your 3rd last warning, you're late again and I'm kicking your ass to the curb."" John said with a stern tone.

""Alright alright...I'm sorry I just was on my way here an-"" John cut off Arin

""I just said I don't give a shit! Do what I asked please."" John said with anger.

All while this was happening I couldn't help but notice the lack of cars in the parking lot. It's late at night on a Tuesday. Shouldn't there be more people here? Probably why no one noticed the smell, No one lives here.

We got all suited up, big yellow hazmat suits, respirators and goggles. Dressed to the nines ready for whatever it is we were going into. 

We had to walk up 5 flights of stairs just to get to the fucking apartment. For some reason they didn't have an elevator in this place. How the hell do they even get furniture in these rooms. 

""So what's the room number?"" Arin asked

""565 is the room, we're almost there."" John said winded from the stairs.

We finally got to the room. A coffee brown stain on the bottom of a white door that has seen much better days. The green paint on the trim of the door has begun chipping and falling off as if it were dripping some rank ichor onto the dark grey carpet of the hallway. 

Little did any of us know at the time. This rot was a sign of the corruption that seeped out from within that horrible room. A sign of the foreboding madness that lay waiting within.

""So uh who wants to do the honors and open the door?"" John asked Arin and I in a bouncy tone. He's clearly been doing this much longer than us.

""I got it."" I said with my chin to my chest and hand in the air.

As I put my hand on the door knob I couldn't help but feel a creeping sense of anxiety. Not exactly full blown panic or anything, but the feeling in my gut that whatever it is we were going to walk in on was something that should not be mettled with. Not in the sense of gore, but something completely off. Something macabre that should be left well alone...

 As I turned the door knob a small voice ever so soft was screaming at me to quit that job right then and there and up and leave. I could deal with John later I'm a good worker, Im sure he would understand. But I gritted my teeth and opened the door. A rush of air flooded into the stale dark apartment. Even through the respirator I could smell the all too familiar coppery scent of blood.

 I sat there for a second, and I couldn't put my finger on why. I've done multiple jobs before this, seen horrible things. So why does this one job in a random apartment complex feel like something so wrong. I huffed to myself and let out a small ""okay."" And heaved the door all the way open as if I had to push it through some sort of viscious fluid.

The door let out a small creak and a smack. As it hit the wall. I saw nothing, it was too dark in the apartment. So I stepped my right boot in and reached my arm onto the wall. Desperately reaching out for some sort of switch, finally my hand caught leverage. I flipped the light on and the scene before me was something I could never have imagined.

As the lights came on, John, Arin and I were absolutely taken back. The only person to utter any form of opinion or word about what laid before us was John a quick short simple ""woah."" Is all he said.

The room laid out, a simple small 2 bedroom apartment. Living room, kitchen and bedroom were right in front of us and to the right was a small bathroom. In the corners of the room crimson erupted up from the baseboard just out of grasp of the ceiling in all four corners. 

Crumpled pages laid sprawled out in a random incoherent order all around the room. The couch laid in 2 pieces split down the middle as if someone too heavy sat right in the center. The bed displayed signs of ensanguination, the mattress soaking up the hemmorage like a giant sponge. Writings all over the wall, the only decernable message in some desperate manner was a name or a word? 

""Vrag Gnasth?"" I said aloud in a questioning manner.

""What the hell does that mean."" Arin said puzzled

At the center of all of this laid a rotting mass of meat and rotting teeth. Laying in front of it all, a small brown journal with an almost vine looking design on the cover. 

""What the fuck."" I said in disbelief

Arin stands there saying nothing. A man of few words and even fewer thoughts. Fucking hate that guy.

""Well let's get to it! I said it earlier and I'll say it again. I don't want to be here all night. I got a date with a 30 rack at 6am and you can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning."" John said and smacked his hands together with a loud clap and bounced forward into the gore with a mop and bucket. Old blood sticking to the wheels of the bucket as he pushed it into the room.

Shaking his head Arin followed behind. 

After a solid 2-3 hours of cleaning and scrubbing and ripping up the carpets.

I picked up the brown journal that was now tossed to the side, in a pile of dreams put to an end too early.  I flipped through the pages, It looked fairly normal with random dates and entries almost like a diary.

""Hey John, so what are we gonna do with all this uh.."" I looked down at the pile of rotting carrion ""..this...guys things?""

""I was told to throw it all away, the guy didn't have any family."" John said packing the mans clothes into a garbage bag.

I figured I would keep it for myself and read it later. I don't know why I had the urge to take it for myself, but I had this itch in my brain I couldn't scratch and at that moment taking the journal felt like it would help.

Me and Arin stood in front of the van fully packed with bags full of torn up carpet and various fluids. I pulled down the hood of my suit and lifted off the respirator taking in the biggest suck of fresh air iv had in the past 5 hours. Whiping the sweat off my forehead I turn to John who was walking out of the apartment complex.

""Is that the last of it?"" I said with a huff catching my breathe from the 5 flights of stairs. ""My legs feel like fucking jello."" I whined into the air twords no one. 

""They seriously need to put an elevator in there or something."" Said Arin holding his lower back

""Yup, that's most of it. The morning crew will come in and finish up in about 3 hours, so we should be set to go home."" John said with a satisfied smile.

""I'm beat, see you guys later."" Arin said as he turned around to walk to his car.

""Wait up man."" I said to him in an annoyed tone ""John is there anything else you need from us? Are we good?"" I said with a thumbs up 

John gave us a hearty thumbs up and sent us on our way. I turned around and bolted twords my car I couldn't get there fast enough, I needed a shower and bad. Arin said bye to me but I scoffed and got into my car. Fuck that guy. Dude seriously sucks.

After a long drive of depersonalizing and listening to the radio. I finally came too as I pulled into my drive way. I didn't have much, just a nice little 1 story home I rented out with the money I made from the job. I walked in and threw my keys on the kitchen table and tossed the odd journal beside it.

After washing blood from my ears and the little bits of whatever the hell that got in through the hood. I dried off my hair and plopped into bed. The sun was rising at this point.

Thinking back on that job, why didn't any of us even question what the hell we walked in on. The dude was reduced to a pile of meat. Not to mention the rotted teeth that were thrown into the mess, it doesn't make any sense. It was just needlessly violent for no reason. 

Most of the scenes, even murders aren't like that. like yeah it's gross but it's someone laying in bed or on the floor, maybe some blood here and there in the carpet or on the walls. Not a pile of organs and bone and a cascade of blood all throughout the apartment. 

I decided I'd do a little research online to see what had happened to the guy. I didn't find much, just a name and a obituary. The guy really didn't have any family, his name was Daniel Cline. I guess he was married at one point but had a nasty divorce.

Obviously I wouldn't find anything on him if there really was something odd going on... It's not like I'm some CIA agent, all I have is Google. But at the crime scene there were pages almost laid out on the floor in a manner like he was studying something. Not to mention that another language written on the wall in blood, Vrag Gnasth. 

""Vrag Gnasth, that doesn't even make any sense."" I said allowed questioning it once again. 

So I tried googling that and nothing came up only that typical ""your search query couldn't find existing documents.""

""Whatever"" I thought.

I decided I'd get some sleep so maybe I could actually wake up at a normal time to get some stuff done before everything closed. 

I awoke to the sound of grinding. Almost like a squeeking sound. Like glass scouring together, violently. The sound itself gave me a visceral reaction. I could feel a chill down to the core of my bones. My eyes shot open almost in a panic. I looked around my room and nothing still alone as always. 

I took a peek at the time, it was 10pm What the hell? I fell asleep at 8am. You're telling me I slept for 15 hours. Probably from all the hard work I did going up and down those stairs.

 I decided I'd check my phone to see if John messaged me about a new job, Im normally on call at random times during the week. This was one of those times, but nope no texts or calls. Guess no one's died recently.. or found at least. While checking my phone I couldn't help but notice a slight pain in my jaw. That same aching feeling I got when my wisdom teeth were pulled when I was 17. Sore, aching?  

""Ow"" I said to myself rubbing my jaw. 

I groaned as I opened and wiggle my mouth around in an attempt to maybe stretch out the pain. No dice, it was still there.  

Shaking it off, I rolled out of bed and threw on some old shirt after giving it the sniff test, I decided it would be a pretty boring night considering it was late. Only thing open right now is the gas station down the street so I guess I'm not getting groceries. I plopped my happy ass down on the couch in my living room rubbing my aching legs and grabbing the remote. Figured I'd throw on some creep cast or something on YouTube, catch up on some old stories. 

While watching them talk about some goofy my little pony story I started hearing that grinding noise again. So I paused the video, looking around the room listening trying to pin point the exact source of this noise just so I could stop it. It was horrible! No matter where I looked it sounded like it was right on top of me. 

I figured maybe it was something outside. So I opened my window and nothing, there's absolutely no one out there and why would there be? . I threw my head in my hands. And that's when I noticed it, it was me. I was the source of the excruciating noise. I have been grinding my teeth this whole time! As soon as I caught it, it stopped. And soon after the pain I felt this morning returned. 

""What the fuck"" I said rubbing my jaw. 

""Maybe it's all the stress from work getting to me?"" I'm pretty sure stress can do weird things like that right? Maybe I just need some beer, take the edge off. That gas station down the road might actually come in handy after all.

I flung open the door to the easy fill and heard a loud chime of the bell above the door. At the counter was an overweight man with glasses and a unkempt beard. Looked like he couldn't be fucked to be here. He was sitting at the counter with his arms wrapped around his chest and his chin down staring at his little phone. ""Probably a discord mod."" I thought to myself and laughed.

I made my way to the back and grabbed a 6 pack of Bush. Didn't like the stuff that much but it's what I could find that wasn't shitty. I brought it up to the counter.

""How ya doin."" I said making small talk with the man

""Ohhh you know...just another day in paradise. Been looking for the girl of my dreams back here on my phone."" He said with a snark laugh

""Oh yeah?"" I laughed nerviously 

Oh God one of these. I thought to myself

""That'll be 8.95$ sir."" He said with hot breath

I gave him the cash.

""Looks like you got your wisdom teeth pulled recently. Your cheeks are puffed up, I wouldn't be drinking beer like this if I were you. You know, it can actually unclott the blood and give you dry socket."" He said while he was giving me my change.

""What?"" I felt the back of my jaw and sure enough it was swollen like a gumball.

I took my change and quickly left the gas station.

As I sat in my car I hurriedly pull down the sun shield and looked into the mirror. Holy shit I look like I got hit by a baseball bat. I drove home rubbing my face and racking my brain thinking about what I could have done to start this? I mean maybe grinding my teeth? But really that vigorously and not noticing while I did it?! What the hell.

As I sat back down on the couch I cracked open one of the beers and took a sip. The cold beer on the back of my gums felt nice. The alcohol helped too and the pain soon subsided, as I watched YouTube I felt myself finally relaxing. No more pain in my face and no more pain in my legs fucking finally I thought. After finishing the 6 pack of Bush I soon fell asleep on the couch with my TV on. 

While I slept I drempt of a dark void with a crimson glow. I was standing there that much I knew. I could feel my body but not see anything. I tried to look at my hands but nothing was there. I felt the increasing panic rise in my chest and my breathe quicken. It felt as though I had masses and bumps under my skin, wriggling and moving. 

The foreign objects, I could feel them pushing against one another begging for more room inside my arms. All I hear is the same grinding sound but this time it is accompanied by a wet sloshing smacking sound. Like meat in a grinder that is far too dull to get the job done without violent force.

 The noise rose slowly in volume. Getting louder and louder. I desperately looked around for something, anything. Any sort of light. Something to grace my eyes with an explanation or some sort of false comfort. There was nothing but the sound ""Gnasstthhh Gnasssshhhthhh Gnassssttthhhh"" louder and louder

It felt like I was stuck in this void for hours. I could feel my palms pressed against my ears but nothing stopped this noise from assaulting my ear drums ""GNASTHSH GNASHTHHH GNASSSSHHHHTTTHHHH"" I finally awoke in a panicked sweat. 

 

""WHAT THE FUCK!"" I yelled to myself.

I franticly rubbed my arms and legs to check if I was infact okay. There was nothing, it was a dream. I knew that but I couldn't stop myself.  The pain in my face has returned and is definetly not ignorable. I rushed to the bathroom to look in the mirror. Prying my mouth open and cheek to the side. In the back of my mouth, my wisdom teeth were growing back in. 

Blood soaked the bottom of the tooth already half way erupting from my gums. My  wisdom teeth are growing back at an alarming pace. I poked them, they were real but they weren't nearly as secure as the rest of my teeth. They grew as if there was nothing below to anker them into my mouth. 

 I poked and prodded and moved them with my fingers. Twisting and pushing the left molar. I pulled my hand out of my mouth and steadied myself on the bathroom sink looking into the mirror. I don't want to but I think I have too. I smack my hands on the edge of the sink, open my mouth and lean closer to the mirror with determination. I grabbed my left wisdom tooth and pulled. The pain was unimaginable.


 I yanked and the tooth gave way. As I pulled a thick stringy twine-like mass of veins laid below. I yelled at the top of my lungs as I pulled, blood pooled into the crevice underneath my tongue. I felt the warmth of blood filling my mouth. Screaming in pain gargling as it went down my throat. I didn't care, this wasn't right it shouldn't be growing back. It doesn't make any sense. Finally with a swift ""plenk"" the tooth came out. Leaving a small hole with flesh in its place, oozing yellow and white fluid. My effort wasn't unrewarded though, the pain had begun to fade in the left side of my face.


I breathed heavily spitting the blood and infection into the sink. Taking a deep sip of water I swished it around and spit. Finally as I calmed myself, I took a good look at the tooth. There was a full crown on the top but the sides were ripe with decay. It smelled like rot. 

Underneath laid a dark red ball of tissue. I tossed it to the side of my bathroom counter. ""What the fuck is going on."" I could feel tears welling in my eyes. Why the hell don't I have health insurance. I cursed myself on top of all the bulshit that was happening. With my head in my arms draped over the bathroom sink I wept. 


I grabbed the tooth and returned to my couch, plopping myself back down defeated with the pain I still felt in the rest of my face. I wanted it to stop but if it meant going through what I just did again and again I don't think I could do it. I stared at this alien object I extracted from my maw. 


""It just doesn't make any fucking sense."" I sighed.


Googling ""can wisdom teeth regrow in face"" didn't yield any information because surprise no they fucking don't. So now I'm sitting here in pain wondering what the hell is even happening to me. Laying down on my couch defeated and staring at the ceiling. 

The silence didn't last long though. It starts up again, the grinding of my teeth. Rubbing vigorously and with force hard enough to shatter my teeth, I was waiting for them to shatter through one another into the gums above and below. But that isn't happening. Over and over I open my mouth smack it back down and grind my teeth hard.

 I scream in pain but it comes out as muffled yelp from my mouth being forced shut. I panic, I don't know what to do. I don't have control over my own jaw. The only thing I can think to do in my altered state is punch myself as hard as I can in the mouth. Doing so lodges two rotted teeth into my knuckles. 


""OKAY I GOTTA GET HELP"" I say allowed 


I quickly rummage for my phone, it must have fallen into the cracks during the struggle with my over active jaw. I try to stick my hand in between the cushions but the teeth that are stuck in my left hand dig further into my tendons. That's when I noticed it. 


""I hit myself with my right fist, how the hell did-"" I say puzzled


I pull my hand from the couch and hold it out in front of my face inspecting every inch of my hand. 2 rotted teeth are peeking out from the back of my hand, 3 are growing from under my finger nails 2 under my thumb and 1 under my pinky. I yell in panic as I notice they're slowly growing ripping and tearing apart my nails grasp from my finger. 


""What do I do! WHAT DO I D-"" I begin to cough and choke as my throat begins to close. 

I feel my face begin to turn red and the pressure growing in my visage. I look down and see bumps begin to form under my skin along my arms. I raise my shirt and see the same. Blood begins to pour out of each hole. Growing and growing, heavier and heavier I feel my feet begin to press into the carpet below me. All at once I feel as though I will erupt, pop like a zit filled with calcium.

 My vision begins to fade to black. I'm begging and pleading inside myself for this to stop. As it begins to crescendo I feel my body stretch up and up, finally I collapse into myself. A wave of blood erupts from me like a volcano. Shooting in every single direction in my little home. There I lay, a pile of what I once was. Gone. 

I cannot see. I am not me. I am not here. I simply hear the gnashing of teeth and the chewing of meat. I am with him. He is with me. We are one. I am whole once again. 






""Hey Arin, we got another clean up job. I'll send you over the address. When you see it just let me know if you'll be alright doing it with me. I know it might be tough."" John said over the phone in a somber tone.


""Sounds good"" I say as I hang up the phone.


My phone beeps with a notification. When I check it, I notice it's my friend Wills address. Oh shit... I guess that explains why he hasn't shown up to work in a couple of days. 


As I walk up to the familiar home I've only seen dropping off my co-worker when he had car troubles. I see John already suited up and ready. 


""We started at 10 right John?"" I said concerned.


""Yeah we did, you're on time. Guess I'm just antsy to get this clean up done. Will didn't deserve this..."" John said sadly


""Yeah he didn't..."" I said with my hands in my pockets and a sigh.


When me and John finished up our portion of the clean up I noticed that same journal that we saw at the other job on Wills table. I thought that was odd, so I decided to open it up and take a look at what was written in there. Sure enough the first couple pages were just day to day stuff. Boring days at the office, something about a bad divorce with this guy's wife cheating. 


""There's that weird thing again Vrag Gnasth"" I said aloud to myself.


But then I flipped towards the back and noticed a page with something real weird scribbled on it over and over. It looked like it was written in a hurry almost like someone was panicking. All it was over and over was ""don't say his name""

1r423yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1r423yj/a_serial_killer_broke_into_my_house_that_isnt/,A Serial Killer Broke Into My House... That Isn't Even The Scary Part,"By HR Welch

It was around midnight a few years ago when I heard the sound of someone breaking into my house. I don’t think I had more than twenty minutes of sleep but as soon as I heard the window being broken I was wide awake and looking for my phone to call the police. 

My heart sank when I remembered that I left it downstairs, charging in the kitchen. The source of the break in. 

I live alone, had no one as backup and didn't have a gun, so I grabbed the only thing that could pass as a weapon: a baseball bat. Once I had that, I psyched myself up to go downstairs to face the intruder. 

Once I reached the bottom step I saw the silhouette of a man sitting at my kitchen table. It was dark so I could not see what he looked like but the stink coming off him was enough to curl my nose hairs. It was obvious even without the lights on that he was, at best, a drifter and at worst a vagrant. Either way, even a blind man could see that whoever broke into my house fell on hard times. Not that that was going to change my mind about kicking him out of my house. He did break in after all. 

When I turned on the lights I could see that his clothes were old, dirty and torn. It was as though he pulled them out of a dumpster. He was so skinny that I wouldn't be surprised if the man was sick on top of being malnourished. His hair was long and stringy and, just like his beard, it grew in patches. The way he sat there motionless with his thousand yard stare and tears forming in his eyes made me think that he had given up on life. 

I was about to tell him to get out but as soon as I opened my mouth I noticed that he had a shotgun on his lap. 

Upon seeing this I lowered the bat and nervously asked him what he wanted. However he didn’t answer me. Instead, he just sat still and stared straight ahead as if I wasn't even in the room with him. 

Scared, I asked him if he was hungry and that I could make him something. As a kid I was instructed to give the homeless food instead of money since they might buy booze or drugs with it, but the man didn't answer. So after a long awkward silence I took the initiative and went to heat up some leftovers in the microwave. As I was doing this I prodded the stranger with questions, what his name was, what he wanted and if he wanted me to call anyone. 

He did not answer for a long time and hardly noticed the food I placed in front of him once it was ready. However, once he started talking he told me a story that would change my life forever. 

He said his name was Cole Dyer and admitted to killing twenty people. 

I’m not at all embarrassed to say that I cried and begged for my life at this point. This only angered Cole.

“I have something I need to fucking get off my chest. So sit the fuck down and shut up.”

Doing what he said, I sat across from Cole who told me how he got started killing people. His first victim was a hooker who he choked to death when he thought she was stealing from him. With the shotgun in his lap I didn't want to anger him so I just sat there and didn't ask any questions. 

Cole would go on to explain that this victim wasn't killed like the others because, at that time he didn't know how he wanted to murder people, or for that matter, knew that he had a taste for it.

“I figured it would be just a matter of time before some cop showed up at my doorstep or came to my work to ask questions. But after a few weeks of no one coming around and not even a mention in the obituaries, I figured I was in the clear” Cole explained. “It shouldn't be surprising that no one gave a shit about her. If anyone cared for her she wouldnt have been a fucking hooker, you know?”

Finally having a way to vent his frustrations and no longer feeling like some cog in the machine, Cole’s murderous fantasies took on a life of their own. 

“When I tried going after the second person, I tried to strangle her with a piece of guitar string. That was messy and loud and I nearly got caught. Not long after that, maybe five or six people later I came up with my own preferred method of killing people” Cole explained. “I even gave myself a silly name: The ‘Pass It On Killer.’”

It was the first time I spoke in what seemed like an hour. A single word. 

“Why?”

“Why what? The name?” Cole asked but I was too afraid to answer. 

Annoyed with my silence, Cole went ahead and explained his reasoning by justifying his twisted sense of righteousness and questionable moral compass. The gist of it was that if he killed enough “pests” good things would come back to him. 

Symbolizing this he would replace the head of his previous victim with the most current.

“Cutting off a head is hard. Even if you have power tools it's messy shit. Took a while before I got the hang of it though” Cole confessed, oblivious to my disgust. “I rigged a bike pump to a catheter, snaked it through the axillary nerve until it reached the superior vana cava. It only took about two minutes before the blood stopped flowing and by then removing the head was pretty much blood free”.

Realizing killing people he knew was a sure way of getting caught Cole learned what questions to ask complete strangers to discover the “pests” in their lives. This was easier than Cole would have guessed because in the end who didn’t like talking about themselves?

“I was always good at talking to people, you know? I could talk the devil into lighting himself on fire. Because of that it was easy to learn where the pests lived, worked, drove and more.""

Since the murders were spread out nationwide and none of his victims had any connections to each other or Cole, the authorities were at a loss. When there was a news article talking about a murder no one ever mentioned that they were connected. 

“They didn't want to cause a panic, you know? It wasn't often, but when the newspapers said the head was removed, they would say it was removed with a sword or an ax or whatever. They did this so when someone tries to take credit, they say the wrong tool and the police know it's bullshit and a waste of time. Obviously I never called any of the hotlines or tried to taunt authorities. That would just give them more clues to work with.”

I felt sick. This man was crazy and dangerous. More than that, he had a gun and was sitting across the table from me. 

“At first hearing and reading about the police chasing down leads terrified me. However after so much bullshitting they did to the public, their claims that they were closing in on a suspect didn't bother me in the slightest” Cole said with a rotten tooth smile that quickly evaporated. 

A flood of tears started filling his eyes and he blinked them away before taking the first nibble of food.

Just when it seemed that he was calm, Cole shouted at me, demanding that I grab a pen and paper and jot down his tale. 

Who was I to say no? Even though he had his hands on the table there was still a shotgun in his lap. I didn’t want to bet that it wasn't loaded or that I was faster. The safe bet was just to write the story he was telling me and hope he would show me mercy.

“I was doing this for a long time. Nearly ten years at this point. And while scouting for the twenty-first victim I found myself behind a small series of apartment buildings” Cole said, shaking his head as if he was in disbelief of his own tale. “I heard a small group of people huddled around someone's basement apartment, whispering to whoever was inside. They were a ways away so I couldn't make out the details at the time but I could see that something wasn't right about them. They were dirty. Long greasy hair and beards. But there was something else about them. Something… something evil.”

“Why do you say that?” I asked without thinking. To this day I don't know if that outburst was because I was curious or tired.

“One by one they stopped their hushed whispering and turned their gazes towards me. It was creepy as fuck so I got the hell out of there” Cole responded as though he didnt hear my question. “When I took a peek over my shoulder they were following me but stayed just out of the cone of light the street lamps provided.”

I had to admit, that sounded pretty scary, but evil? I kept my thoughts to myself and kept writing.

“It creeped me out. I was already thinking of finding someone else to kill because I don’t like killing in apartment buildings. Too many neighbors to see you or hear you when you're using the saw, you know? When I saw them though, that sort of settled it. I wasn’t going to go back there. I kept looking back in the mirror on the way home to see if I was being followed but in the five hour drive I didn’t see a thing behind me. The next day, however, I noticed a car driving slowly though my parking lot every few hours. I was smoking lots of weed at the time and figured I was just being paranoid but the next night I woke up to tapping on the door”.

As Cole explained to me what happened next he started to rock back and forth the way I’ve seen children do in an effort to calm himself down before continuing his story. 

“Thought it was my imagination at first but then I started hearing my name being whispered from the hallway. When I realized I wasn't imagining the noises I looked out the peephole.”

Cole took a moment before continuing but before he spoke he swallowed and took a drink of water from the glass I gave him. 

“There were at least five of them that time. Dirty, long hair and dark sunken eyes that seemed to glow with the hatred of some sort of hellist pit. They spent the entire night begging me to come out.” 

With the exception of the eyes, it was as though Cole was describing himself. Again, this was a thought I kept to myself.

“In that building it wasn't uncommon to hear drunken exes pound on doors demanding to be let in so their begging went on for hours. Eventually a neighbor I never bothered to get to know decided to open the door to tell the strangers to keep it down. She stopped mid sentence the moment she saw them,” Cole explained. “They pushed her back into her apartment and all piled in. Through that thin wall I could hear them tearing through her place and when she cried or begged or groaned they just laughed. Eventually they made the woman beg me to come out from my apartment. Whenever she did they would laugh and instruct her to say it louder. She would comply with their demands and her reward would be getting hit more.”

“Jesus” I blurted out.

“When I refused to open the door or even respond they grew bored and started getting even more violent with the woman. First the sounds of punches and things getting broken, but then… Jesus. They were eating her. It was loud and wet and lasted until the sun came up”.

“How did you know they were eating her? They were in a different apartment.”

“They didnt close the fucking door,” Cole answered. “Saw it when I was leaving.” He was clearly annoyed with the interruption, reminding me that I didn’t want to interrupt someone who was obviously crazy. The best course of action for me to take was to remain silent and allow Cole to go on for as long as he wanted. 

Cole then quickly ate the rest of the meatloaf I heated up for him and asked for more. When I grabbed him another piece, he stopped me from heating it up so I set it in front of him instead. Considering how he looked I thought he was going to inhale it like the other piece, but it sat there for a long time before he touched it. 

“I didn't leave my room until I was confident they were gone and that it was safe to leave. There was no way I was going to stay there. No fucking way. I packed my car and took off. I didn't know what I would need at the time, so I took my camping gear, my tools, a few guns and of course, the head of the previous pest who I kept on ice. After that I went straight to some army surplus store to get the rest of what I needed.” 

At first I assumed he was going to go out in the woods, but it became obvious that what he really meant was staying at a seedy hotel that didn't take credit cards or require ID’s. 

“About a week later I was getting some grub at some grocery store, just walking in the parking lot and minding my own business, right? They drove up right behind me and laid on the horn. I didn’t even bother getting something to eat after that. I just wanted to get the hell out of there. By the time I remembered that I left the head back in the hotel's mini fridge I had already crossed two state lines.”

I could tell this bothered him greatly and I assumed it was because now the police would have a lead and find the identity of the Pass It On Killer. However, as if reading my mind, Cole let out a dry laugh and told me the reason he was sour about it, even years later, was because he has “completion anxiety.”

At this point of the story Cole had to take a moment, and knowing that he had a shotgun on his lap I gave it to him. Hoping that my kindness would be repaid and I could keep my head once he finished his tale I poured him some milk and offered him the rest of the baby carrots I had in the fridge.

Since I live alone, I don't have much food for unexpected guests. At the time I was sure the food I was offering him would be enough of an excuse for this psycho to kill me. When I set it down in front of him, my hands were trembling.

“They had to know what I was driving, so I traded my car for a van. At least I could sleep in the van, right? Saves money on hotels and shit” Cole explained. “About five weeks later I crossed their paths again. This time I was in a deep sleep when I heard them say my name. In my dream the name was like an echo and when I woke up my eyes were immediately locked on the dark eyes of a woman with the same sinister resemblance as the men I saw back at the apartment. Without a beard, however, this woman's disfiguration was more noticeable.”

“Disfiguration?” I asked.

Cole gave a grunt that might have meant nothing, something or everything. “I might as well tell you everything, right? You are writing down my tale after all” Cole said, clearly not excited to relive the experience. “At first I thought it was a cleft lip and chin but it wasn't. The few teeth that she had were small and brown and grew fucking everywhere” Cole explained as his dirty fingers were fidgeting with the gun in his lap. “Like the gums and the inside of the cheeks and shit. Even in the dark I could see their black eyes and when I jumped into the front seat and turned over the engine the headlights revealed dozens of her family. They were all standing ten or so feet apart from each other, scattered around. Some were naked but they were all standing still, smiling and just looking at me. Like they were giving me permission to leave.”

Gooseflesh covered my entire body and I was having trouble keeping up with Coles story because he was talking too fast. 

“I tried to swerve and hit a few with the front tire or to at least clip them with the van’s fat ass; however, they all stepped to the side, effortlessly avoiding getting run down.”

As Cole took a moment to catch his breath, I asked what he meant when he said “Her family.”

“Thats a recent term I gave them. At the time I thought they were demons or vampires but not any longer.”

I wanted to ask him why he no longer thought this was the case, but I kept this question to myself. I felt I pressed my luck enough at this point with all the questions I had been asking. After all this man was insane and armed.

“After that encounter I abandoned the van and stole a car. I would do this every so often, whenever I felt that they were closing in on me. A gut feeling. This was triggered by anything from something I imagined seeing in the corner of my eye to the cries coming from a murder of crows.”

Again, I had a bunch of questions but didn't dare ask them. What did crows have to do with these people after Cole?

“Zig zagging across the country I made every effort to forever rid myself of these people. I would stay inside at night and if I could I would sleep during the day. I would pass the time by reading and listening to music. You know, good music. Peter Warlock? Bach?”

I knew who Bach was, but never heard of the other name. 

“Classical?” I asked, surprised because of Cole's appearance.

“Vivaldi Concerto No. 5 is my favorite. Bet you wouldn't have guessed that I also play the cello.”

I had no idea if Cole was pulling my leg or not, but I didn't have time to react, Cole was back to telling his story.

“While on the run I would take odd jobs here and there to pay for what I needed to survive. A tractor assembly line in Michigan, a toll booth operator in Florida and a semi weight station in Nevada. Whatever job paid in cash and as long as I didn’t have to work at night. No matter where I found work I would not stay long before feeling that they were closing in on me. More often than not I would leave before getting a paycheck.”

Up to now he had been talking to me, a captive audience due to the shotgun on his lap for well over four hours. I was tired but Cole seemed to be wide awake. During a moment of silence I asked Cole if he wanted any coffee. He accepted so I made a pot for the two of us to share. 

I could feel Cole stare at me as I made the coffee and my heart was beating so loud I swore Cole was able to hear it. The silence went on for what felt like hours. Finally I couldn't take it anymore and had to break the silence. 

“How do you take your coffee?”

“Very strong. No cream. No sugar.”

As the coffee started brewing, the tension was so thick that it made the room feel as though I was breathing through a hot wet rag. This went on for some time and I think Cole was enjoying the sight of making me uncomfortable because he only continued his story when I started filling the cups.

“Before coming here I was staying at a place up in northern Canada for about three months. A loft above a bar. Figured that a bar full of people at night would keep me safe” Cole said, again fidgeting with the gun. “I had an arrangement with the owner. In exchange for the room, I would work as the janitor, unload trucks, do some deliveries, etcetera. I kept to myself and people left me alone, the only time I was ever bothered was when there was work to be done. It was nice while it lasted, however when they finally arrived they… they were under the window in the alley, softly calling out to me. With all the music being played downstairs I have no idea how long they were there, but the moment I knew it was them the giggling began.”

For some reason, giggling as soon as Cole noticed them creeped me out far more than anything he said so far. 

“They tried to flatter me by saying they were my biggest fans and tried to prove it by telling me details that only the Pass It On Killer would know” Cole said, his eyes looking into the darkened room behind me. 

“I told them off. Called them vampires because they couldn't come inside without permission. That was the first thing I ever said to them and as soon as I said that, everything went silent. I must have been used to the sounds they were making because I didn’t notice it until it stopped. That’s when someone with a strange accent told me that they were not vampires but in fact something else. Something that I---”. 

Cole never finished this thought. In the silence that followed I didn't know what he was going to do and this terrified me. 

It might have been lack of sleep on my part, possibly even momentary insanity but I had to know who, or what was chasing Cole. When I asked he didn't answer so I pressed my luck and asked him a second time 

“What else needs permission to enter a house other than vampires?”

Again he didn't answer and even though I knew it was a mistake to poke the bear I started to ask again. As soon as the words started to leave my mouth Cole reached into his inner breast pocket and pulled out what I thought at the time was paper napkins. After inspecting it for a moment with an expression I have never seen before, Cole slapped them down on the table between us. 

Written on them in everything from pen to marker to pencil were the messages “Let us in”, “Open the door” and more. It was hard to tell what else was said because the writing overlapped. However, it was clear to me that these messages were written by dozens of people.

As I picked one up to look at it closer and ascertain what else was written down on them, my finger rubbed the glossy underside. Turning it over I saw that it was a photograph showing Cole sleeping in what appeared to be a small apartment, the next appeared to be him in an abandoned bus, a dirty attic and so on. 

In some of the pictures Cole looked twenty years younger and it made me wonder just how long he was on the run for. I know that stress can prematurely age people but I had a hard time believing that the person in the picture and Cole were one and the same.

“They don't need permission to enter someone's house” he said as his gaze returned to the empty space behind me. 

I had to look back to see if anything was there and was more relieved than words could explain when I saw nothing behind me.

We sat there quietly for what seemed like an eternity before Cole said anything else. When he did it was as if he suddenly remembered that he was telling me a story and picked up where he left off. The part where they then cut the power to the apartment and the bar under him. 

“It didn’t take long before the woman tending bar that night was shouting at them not to come closer. They just laughed. They tore her apart and all I could do was listen and wait until morning to come” Cole confessed with a shake of his head as if to eject the thoughts from his mind. “Thing is, Canada has some long nights during the winter and I only had enough food for a few days”. 

Cole didn’t tell me how long he stayed in that room for and I didn’t want to ask. It was obvious from the thousand yard stare that these events were still fresh in his mind so I kept my mouth shut.

“When I finally left my room I saw gore sprinkled everywhere. Like a trail of breadcrumbs that started from behind the bar and led right to my apartment. I had seen blood before, but this was something else entirely. I was careful not to touch anything with my bare hands as I emptied the cash register and stole a toolbox from the back office so I could switch license plates to throw them off my scent.”

“Do you know how to kill them?” I asked.

Cole shook his head. “I don’t know how to stop them but I think I have a good idea how to slow them down,” but before he could elaborate he noticed that the sun was shining through my kitchen window. Grateful that he went another night without seeing them and having someone he could talk to, Cole thanked me for listening.

I didn’t know what to say to such a story. What could I say? In the pregnant silence that followed I filled the void by rambling about whatever came to mind. My job, the annoying coworkers and how my boss is always looking over my shoulder. 

As if this was at all similar to Cole's own story.

I didn’t think anything of Cole asking me if I liked my job or where I worked at the time and soon I was answering all of his questions. 

After a short while Cole thanked me again, then he stood up, took my car keys off the counter and left without another word.

It might have been ten minutes after Cole left before I called the police and all I said to them was that my house was broken into and that my car was stolen. After all, the truth was so unbelievable that if I said anything else it might make me look as crazy as Cole. 

Maybe I didn't say anything else because I was tired? I don't know for certain.

The more distance I put between myself and that night the less real it felt. But then reality set in once I learned that my boss was found dead a few days later.

According to the local newspaper, Whisper Alley Echos, pieces of my boss were found all over his bedroom. Most people in town considered this to be an exaggeration to stir up newspaper sales and I wanted to agree but it was hard to, considering Cole's tale. 

In the back of my head the idea of what Cole told me being true kept teasing me. It bothered me so much that I ended up hiring a private investigator, a decision I came to regret. I would rather be ignorant of what came next. A week after hiring the PI, I received a phone call informing me that my boss's head was found in the middle of another bloody mess all the way in Cleveland. 

Not only that, but the private investigator also informed me that the local newspaper apparently withheld the fact that a different person's head was discovered in my boss's freezer. I assume it was the head Cole left in the hotel fridge but kept this to myself.

Over the next few weeks I kept thinking of the story Cole told me. If those thoughts weren't front and center they were creeping in the back, ready to pounce on a happy moment to turn it sour. 

It didn’t take long before I started seeing dark patches dart from one shadow to the next, disappearing as soon as I turned to look at it. At first I chalked this up to being a mouse, the reflection off of my glasses or lack of sleep (After all it was much harder to sleep in a house that was broken into). Hoping it wasn't mice because of my hatred towards them I bought some medicine in town so I could get some rest at night. It worked wonders when it came to getting shuteye but did nothing to stop me from seeing these shadows.

With an embarrassing frequency I would imagine the reflecting eyes on the side of the road were Cole's night visitors or think of them whenever I heard the house settle. 

It was as though toying with the idea of them being real was enough to invite them into my life.

I don’t recall what came first, hearing my name being called out in public, a sound similar to a murder of crows cawing or the soft scraping at my screen windows at night. However once I realized that the noises and the visions were real there was no way to block them out.

At night the soft whispers were hard to make out and the more I tried to ignore them the more I thought about them.  

I could not tell you how many nights I stayed up just so I could put my ear up to the wall but I can tell you it was worth the effort, because unlike Cole, I know what they want. 

They whispered of a message that took months before I understood it fully, but in those words that only someone with a certain madness could grasp, I understood. You see, they aren’t a family like Cole said. They are more akin to nomads who will only accept members with certain propensities to join their roving community.

It wasn't as long as you might think before I did the one thing Cole was never brave enough to do and opened the door. 

The first night I opened the door for them was terrifying, like losing one's virginity. Even with Cole's descriptions there was no way I could have been prepared for their appearance because they resembled humans the way sharks look like dolphins.

During these conversations they instructed me to share Cole's story with the world so some of his madness could rub off on others and “season the meat.”

In this partnership of ours they gained a buffet of people, while I gained so much more. Not only would they tell me tales I would pass off as my own, but in time I could join their ranks. 

Heralding their coming will include everything from seeing shadows in the corner of your eyes, the sounds of whispering and something similar to the cawing of crows. 

Once these or any dozen of other signs occur, it's the beginning of the end. And when that happens you can thank me, a better and far more successful Pass It On Killer than Cole ever was.",2,1771019019.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

Recently, I reached out to several professionals at a major consulting firm for referrals. My experience was a tale of two very different professional cultures.

On one hand, I had a long conversation with a professional who, after reviewing my resume and discussing the role, ultimately told me: *""I’m sorry, I only give referrals to those I have a good personal relationship with.""*

On the other hand, I reached out to an Indian professional in the same company. He didn't know me either, but he took the time to critique my resume, suggest improvements, and submitted a referral because he saw I was qualified and trying to break into the industry.

**My takeaway and plea to the professional community:**

For many international students, we don’t have a 10-year network in this country. We are hustling to stay in the market and build a life. When you refuse to refer someone simply because you haven't ""grabbed coffee"" with them, you might be closing a door that could have changed their entire career trajectory.

I understand the desire to protect your professional reputation, but if a candidate is qualified and has a good resume, a ""small act"" of a referral is a life-changing gesture of kindness.

**Is this a cultural difference in how we view professional help?** To those of you in a position to help: please consider being a bridge for someone else. You don’t always need a deep ""relationship"" to recognize talent and give someone a fair shot.",1,1771018894.0,recruitinghell,0,0.67,False

I'm having a real crack at improving my health. One aspect of that is obviously nutrition, so I've installed SnapCalorie to get a rough idea of what I'm putting into myself without it being so difficult that I give up.

The first thing I've noticed is my sugar was too high - I've quit honey on my breakfast, but I'm still blowing past my daily limit before breakfast is even finished.

I've allegedly had 34g out of an acceptable 27g already today from:

Oats (+ whole milk, banana, protein powder, psyllium husk)  
and coffee (+ whole milk)

Most of that is from the milk and banana. Can I just ignore it? Do I need to lose the milk in my oats (water instead?) and maybe just use a splash in my coffee? I figure the banana sugar is largely fine? I also have an apple later in the day, along with another coffee, which push it up further (yesterday I hit 65g).

**\*\*\*\*\* POV- at his apartment**

I woke up to a trail of wet, sloppy kisses slithering down my neck like some desperate bitch trying to mark territory she never owned. My eyes cracked open slowly, pissed, and there she was.

The girl from last night. Naked. Straddling me. Hand between her own legs, grinding on me like I was her personal ride. Sweat shining on her skin. Makeup smeared like she'd been crying.

What the f\*\*k was her name again?

She noticed my eyes open and dove straight for my mouth, tongue shoving in like she was trying to choke me with it. Tasted like stale vodka, cigarettes, and cocaine. I felt nothing. Not even a twitch of interest. I stayed half-hard from morning wood and whatever leftover friction she'd been rubbing against, but my brain was already somewhere else.

Ginger curls. That sarcastic little mouth. The way her lips had felt even though she was sick－ hot,  perfect. F\*\*k. The memory alone made me hard.

She felt it. Pulled back just enough to smirk, twirling a strand of my freshly dyed black hair around her finger like she had any right to touch it.

“Looks good on you…” she purred in that fake-sultry voice that made my skin crawl. “Wanna go for another round?”

The sound of her voice killed whatever arousal was left. Gone. Completely fucking gone. I grinned anyway－ cold, lazy, and grabbed her waist, digging my fingers in hard enough to bruise.

“Nah. I’m drained.”

I shoved her off me like she weighed nothing. She landed on the couch beside me with a surprised yelp. The blanket slid down, pooling around my thighs. I sat up, muscles flexing under the ink and scars, not bothering to cover sh\*t.

She sighed dramatically, stood up, and started collecting her clothes from the floor; bra, panties, dress, heels. She took her sweet time bending over, arching her back, running her hands over her own body like she was performing for an audience of one.

I watched. Not because I gave a f\*\*k. Just because she was there.

My mind was somewhere else.

Ginger hair spilling over my chest again. Her thighs clamping around me. The way her uniform had ridden up. Her chest rising and falling like she couldn't catch her breath. Her goddamn lips. F\*\*k. If I’d known gingers tasted that good, I’d have fucked every single one of them years ago.

“I left a surprise for you,” she said, voice dripping with fake seduction. She made a little call-me gesture with her fingers, blew a kiss, and sauntered out the door. It clicked shut behind her.

Maybe I should raise my standards. I f\*\*k anything with a pulse these days.

I sank back into the couch, arms spread along the backrest, one hand scrubbing over my face. I smelled like sweat, sex, and regret. I was still half-hard from thinking about *her*. I groaned low in my throat, dropped my head back, and bit down hard on my own hand to stop myself from losing it completely.

She’d colonized my f\*\*king head. Ruined me. But in a nice way.

I stared at my phone next to me. I wondered why she hasn’t called or even texted me. Not even once.

Footsteps thudded down the stairs.

R-- appeared in the doorway; dressed sharp for once. Black slim-fit shirt tucked into tailored dark jeans, sleeves rolled to show the ink crawling up his forearms. Silver chain tucked under the collar, small hoop in one ear, locs pulled back into a tight, clean high ponytail instead of the usual messy bun. He looked like he was about to handle business, not f\*\*k around. 

He stopped dead when he saw me sprawled naked on the couch, blanket barely covering my body, room reeking of last night.

“Ugh, bruh… nah. What’s that awful smell?”

I grinned, slow and proud. “I was up in sweat and p\*\*\*y juices all night. What you expect?”

He sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Zee, you really gotta stop－”

“Just mind your business and I’ll mind mine,” I cut in, voice flat.

He looked away. I popped a cigarette between my lips, lit it with the lighter on the coffee table, took a deep drag, and blew smoke toward the ceiling.

R-- typed something on his phone. A small, private smile tugged at his mouth. Probably texting his girl again. Soft-a\*\* motherf\*\*ker.

“Alright, I gotta go,” he said, pocketing the phone and heading for the door.

Just then a hooded figure slipped in behind him－ quiet, twitchy. Z--e. The most spineless housemate I’d ever had the misfortune of sharing oxygen with.

“Yo, boy.”

He froze.

“Get your broke ass over here.”

He shuddered visibly but didn’t move.

I sat up straighter, cigarette dangling from my lips, smoke curling around my face.

“Want me to repeat myself?”

He shook his head fast and shuffled forward, eyes on the floor.

“Where’s the cash?” I asked, voice low. “You gotta pay your portion of the rent.”

He clenched his fists, lips pressed tight. Body shaking like a leaf in a storm. Typical Zeke; silent, useless.

“Z---n, don’t－” R-- started from the doorway.

“Shut your trap before I shut it for you, R--. Go spend some time with your girl.”

Rix shook his head but walked out quietly, door clicking shut behind him.

My gaze flicked back to Z--e. Still silent. Still shaking.

I was half a second from standing up and reminding him who pays the bills around here when my phone chimed.

I dropped back against the couch, snatched it up, and opened the notification.

A wild, barking laugh ripped out of me. I slapped my knee, still laughing so hard my stomach hurt.

I’ve also just realised how long this is, even if you’ve just read one paragraph I’d really appreciate some advice.

So I (F20) have been dealing with issues with my parents for a little while now. Growing up I always thought despite their issues they were excellent parents and I must be the problem for all the shit I’ve done wrong. Looking back now I don’t think I was a bad kid at all I generally listened at school and at home, didn’t smoke or drink or date underage and I literally got into med school so you would think that would be enough for them to think I was a golden kid looool.

I guess my main issues with them right now stems from crazy resentment from how they occasionally treated me during childhood. I got beat every now and then I’d say maybe 20 times in my life for various different things. The ones I remember really clearly are for not eating my apples and oranges in school (that got me a smack with a metal ruler), for lying about the grades I got when I was 8 (now I realise how concerning it was that I felt the need to lie that young), and for most recently at 15 eating a whole box of Tesco chocolate Easter eggs, which resulted in a beating and getting yelled at that I was gonna die of diabetes and be overweight and ugly for the rest of my life and no one will ever want my pig ass looool. What I think caused me even more resentment was my dad hitting my mum twice during my childhood. According to her he’s done it before I was even born but both times I saw it, he was angry at me and decided to take it out on her instead. The first time was cause I wanted to go to the park with my friends and the second time was cause my mum didn’t run fast enough when I said I was burned by a kettle. After each time what hurt more was my mums reaction blaming me, saying I wasn’t worth enduring the abuse for, saying I was a demon not worth sacrificing her life for, etc etc. she always said before me and my brother were the best thing to ever happen to her so this rlly rlly hurt cause it felt like clearly she was lying to our faces. However I also feel like I can’t feel mad at her for this, she was going through such a horrific thing and she probably felt horrible for feeling this way about her kids when she does love us so much.

My mum has also been very controlling about my eating and according to my therapist caused my binge eating issues but I don’t know to what extent I agree with that haha. I understand her being concerned I wasn’t crazy overweight as a child looking back but I still was chubby and I am overweight now, I know she just wants me healthy and all. But she has constantly tried to put me on diets back when I wasn’t even overweight, limited all sweets chocolates as in I’d get screamed at if she ever found any wrappers in my room, would lash out when I gained weight etc etc. I won’t mention all the crazy things she’s said about my appearance and weight cause we will be here all day, but I also can see where she’s coming from I do gotta lock in.

One other thing I resent them for is how they treated me when I was deep in depression. My start of MS3 rlly hit me hard and I rlly rlly wanted to end it all. I was going to crisis sessions at the college, couldn’t even go to placement cause of anxiety and ended up getting on medication and counselling for it. I had hid this all from my parents and one day my mum confronted me for acting like a bitch to them. I won’t lie she absolutely had a point I was acting like a complete bitch and it wasn’t acceptable I was just so resentful that they didn’t recognise that I was feeling this way. When I told her everything she said I was making it up, it was in my head, I have no real problems, if I grew up in India I’d know what real hardship was and I’m just spoiled and bored here, if my friends knew they’d laugh at me, etc etc. in her defense she was much nicer like an hour after this spiel and was willing to pay for a psychiatrist if my college didn’t cover anything. If anything I think that made me feel so much more conflicted cause I know it’s just a cultural thing to not believe in depression yet she still cared so much even though she was mean.

I guess my main issues with it is that my friends do have it so much worse and same with so many people I know. Some of them can’t even leave their house, or their parents work them like a slave in their houses. My parents literally had it ten times worse aswell and that does weigh down on me too. Don’t get me wrong I know I’ve painted them in a very bad light here and it sounds horrible written out, but they also are incredible parents sometimes so the thought of cutting them off does kill me a little. They have always financially provided for me and have never said no to anything I wanted to buy, were fully willing to fund me even after I graduated, are planning on giving me a hefty down payment, etc etc. They’ve never forced me to do chores, always supported me if I wanted to do sports or any extracurriculars, took me and my brother on great vacations,etc. They both would genuinely do anything for me and I know that for a fact that they are more invested in me than a lot of parents I know. If I’m sick in any way or hirt they will drop everything and act like it’s a national emergency haha. I know other people have it so much worse and it makes it all so confusing.

Here are some rules that they have for me to help u make ur decision lol:

\\- \*\*I still have to give them my phone every single night before bed\*\* (ik it’s insane). I’ve tried to fight it but it usually results in a screaming match and my mum saying I won’t sleep properly if they don’t do it.

\\- \*\*I wasn’t allowed to get a job till I was 19\*\* (even then I had to fight hard to get one) and it’s just a minimum wage tutoring job, I tried to get a higher paid one as a server but I’m sure they would throw an absolute fit about that one. -\*\*My location is shared with them at all times\*\* (I don’t think this is that bad) but they check it so constantly so if I’m ever skipping lectures once or twice boom they see and I can expect a rlly angry phone call.

\\- \*\*I’m not allowed to drink at all\*\* (legal age is 18 here), and the one time they caught me I was absolutely blackout and they considered sending me back to the motherland loooool. I woke up the next day to screaming and yelling and my mum telling me that was the most traumatic event of her life and I was the absolute worst daughter in the word for putting her through that (even though I was pretty brainwashed back then I could tell she was being a tad dramatic).

\\- \*\*They are very controlling about me going out\*\*, this is where you guys might think I am overreacting. I fought this very hard in my first year of college and i consistently tried to go out atleast once every two weeks. I’d still come home at 12 or 1 literally would never go to the club as I knew my dad would go absolutely ballistic and take it out on my mum. Recently they have gone a little more insane about it and I get texts by 7 pm asking why I’ve gone out what I’m doing who I’m with etc etc. I know I’m an adult and I’m allowed to be upset at this but all my friends have it so much worse and aren’t even allowed out at night so when they tell me all this I consider myself lucky to even be allowed out. I might defo be overreacting here but I get a literal surge of anger whenever I get these texts, I know they’re just concerned but like it feels so overbearing.

\\- \*\*Literally every decision in my life has to be approved by them -\*\* for example I decided I do not want to do the usmles to get into American residency as I don’t hate myself. To say my mother went insane at this decision isn’t an exaggeration, I was told I’m stupid and I have no ambition and this is why I will never succeed in life. I wanted to go to Vietnam with the rest of my med school friends to do elective there, that was denied and so I’m going to India to see my grandparents instead. I get in trouble if I eat too much chocolate, I can’t drink tea or coffee, etc etc.

Well that’s pretty much it, though I’m sure I’m missing a lot more. I’d really appreciate any advice on this thanks for taking the time to read it if you did! I’m sorry for the length hahahaha.",1,1771018507.0,toxicparents,0,1.0,False

Today, starting at around 13:00 I drank/ate a sip of honey. Straight up honey. I did that every 30 min. I also drank 3 black coffees. 

In total I got in <100 grams of honey. So about 326 kcal. Also got in 280 kcal from a noodle packet I ate. The udon noodle packet was dry noodles. I added salt to it so I got my electrolytes in. 

At the end of the day I drank about 50 ml of water so I could get my vitamin pills in.

1r41t6l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r41t6l,"I was failing every class, and the silence of loneliness was slowly killing me. Then, this one button finally let me study with other people, without saying a single word."," Last semester I was sitting in the library until it closed, surrounded by people but feeling completely alone. Laptop open, tabs everywhere, but I couldn’t start shit. The quiet was deafening. Every time I tried to work, my brain would scream “you’re the only one struggling” and I’d just scroll or stare at the wall for hours. GPA was in the toilet, I was sleeping 4 hours, and I honestly thought I was going to drop out.

I tried all the cute aesthetic templates. They looked pretty and did nothing.

So I built my own dashboard instead. Gamification, frog tasks, streaks. All that stuff helped a little. But the one feature that actually saved me was the **study-together button** nobody talks about.

You click it once, no mic, no voice, no “hey anyone wanna study?” awkwardness. It just drops you into a silent room with other real students who are grinding at the exact same time. You see them typing, flipping pages, drinking coffee… and suddenly you’re not alone anymore. The silence doesn’t feel heavy. The procrastination loses its power.

That button is the reason I went from “I can’t do this anymore” to actually passing with a 3.6.

If you’re in that same library silence right now, feeling like the only one who can’t focus… duplicate this.

But I was never happy and could not ever get the fruit notes I was seeking. For example in an 10 minute roast with a 20% development time reaching first crack at 8 minutes would be 20% DT. Thats a 2 minute DT and an espresso roast for me and all the fruit I'm seeking is absent. 

But that same time reaching first crack with a 30 second DT becomes a 5.88 % DT and I have a very fruity roast that is sweet, balanced and fruity. I roast like that 99% of the time and sometimes only 15 seconds which would be a 3.03 % DT. 

So the past few years on my SR800 I have tossed the "" ratio's "" recommended by some of the ""experts : out the window. As they say the proof is in the pudding. And as one who prefers a fruit forward light roast that still has sweetness, brightness and balance this has become my goto method that works with most all higher elevation naturals.

1r41qj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1r41qj1/whats_that_smell_haasha_37/,What’s that smell? (Haasha 37),"\-- [First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1kjh0gm/crew_application_accepted/) \* [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1qw17lg/false_alarm_haasha_36/) \* Next \* [Wiki & Full Series List](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/authors/majestic_teach_6677/) \--

Humans stink. Not in a bad way, mind you. It’s just that they lack a broader range of smell and thus don’t quite understand how their soaps, shampoos, and other cleaning products are rather more pungent to my nose.

This did mean I could sometimes identify who was in the room as I entered.

“Morning, Rosa!” I said as I smelled floral notes with a hint of strawberries to my left as I entered the galley for breakfast. I also knew before entering the room that it was French toast day, so my breakfast would likely be a piece of French toast with strawberries and eggs. Maybe some whipped cream on top.

“Haasha,” Rosa mumbled as she stumbled past with a tray that was remarkably light on food. However, she had her oversized morning mug with heat activated writing that stated, ‘If you can read this I haven’t had enough coffee yet.’

From there, the room was just a mix of smells. Some floral, some sharp, a few fruity - although sadly the human need to create artificial smells rather than use natural means some of the fruity ones have a harsh chemical scent to them. At least when it comes to scent, the harsh aspect comes off more as medicinal and “clean”, not chemical warfare like artificial flavorings on the tongue.

As I walked towards the chow line, I passed an area that had a distinct pine tree smell and a lone mug ¾ full of coffee was sitting at the end of the table. I looked around the room and James was nowhere to be seen. I rolled my eyes and grabbed the mug. 

“Thanks for cleaning that up, Haasha,” Adam said with a smile. “It’s been sitting there for a little while and we didn’t know whose it was.”

“It belongs to James,” I commented. “I’ll grab a travel lid and bring it down to Engineering. Hopefully he hasn’t gotten a new cup yet.”

“Oh,” he said flatly in response. “That makes sense.”

As I stood in line, the usual mix of smells from the serving line seemed far more limited than usual. I picked up fried eggs, but that was it. When I got to see the options… French toast, fried eggs, oatmeal, and various forms of sugary chemical warfare humans call cereal. My nose had not deceived me, although for a moment I thought the kitchen staff had as the spread was rather disappointing. No sausage, fruity turnovers, strawberry sauce, burritos, or fried potatoes.

When it comes to potatoes, it was shocking to see how often they appeared on the menu and generally in remarkably different forms. Stars forgive you if you suggest hash browns for dinner, as you should be eating roasted potatoes. Fries are acceptable at lunch or dinner, but never breakfast where it would be hash browns or diced and seasoned potatoes. They can be chopped or diced and put into soups, stews, mashed, and all manner of other preparations such that humans will eat them at every meal without objection. In the back of my mind, I figured you could probably use the following catchphrase:

Humanity - powered by potatoes!

Which is why the lack of potatoes on the menu shocked me. 

“What would you like, Haasha?” the server asked pleasantly as I pondered the limited options.

“Just a piece of French toast with one of the liquid center eggs on top,” I finally decided.

“French toast with one over-easy egg coming right up!” she responded happily. 

I took my tray with a sigh and moved along, still a bit disappointed at today’s breakfast when it hit me. Today was briefing day! Definitely not the day to complain about breakfast or fill up too much by asking for seconds.

First Officer Auggie understands humans well, and as such some of his management methods can be a little devious but incredibly effective. Mission briefings are mandatory for all crew, but tend to be boring. As a result, it wasn’t unheard of for people to skip the main briefing and have to be chased down by Auggie or one of the other officers to get the required information. His solution - hit everyone where it matters most. Their stomachs.

Breakfast on briefing days would be minimal and lackluster. However, the post-briefing spread in the shuttle bay? That would be glorious with a wide selection of treats and munchies! You want to choose a fresh baked donut from a selection of over 20 flavors? It would be there. Burritos with freshly made salsa? Check! The menu always rotated yet was always filled with freshly made rare treats.

The rules were simple. To get the good stuff, you needed to be at the briefing in Shuttle Bay Two with your butt in a chair precisely at 10:00am ship time. Then you’d sit for the likely incredibly boring but mandatory mission briefing for up to two hours, followed by one of the snazziest lunches.

To Auggie’s credit, this updated method to encourage briefing attendance was remarkably effective. Officers generally only had to arrange for on-duty personnel to attend an evening briefing to get everyone ticked off the mandatory briefing list, and the on-duty folks were guaranteed to show up as they got a catered meal in the officer’s mess. Unlike us in the ship-wide meeting who had to wait, they were allowed to eat during the briefing. As a result, it wasn’t uncommon for some crew to intentionally swap shifts to get the catered meal instead of the glorious buffet. 

I found a seat with some crew I hadn’t talked to in a while and happily stabbed my egg, so the yellow liquid spilled out and over my French toast as a sauce instead of maple syrup. 

One quick meal later, and I skipped down to Engineering for my pre-briefing duties. 

“Morning, all!” I called out as I entered the room and instantly picked up the pine scent of James. He liked woody smells, so his soap and shampoo selection would rotate between ones with hints of pine, sandalwood, and cedar. I went over and put his coffee down at his station. 

“You forgot your coffee in the mess hall again,” I said dryly. 

“What? Oh, thanks,” he said sheepishly as he quickly grabbed the mug and took a swig. “Oh, yeah. I need this today. I was about to get another cup.”

I rolled my eyes and headed to my work station. There’s a reason he beat out Auggie for the ‘Dude, where’s my coffee?’ Award.

Aside from knowing who is in a room before you see them or knowing what’s on the menu before getting into the galley, one of the other advantages of having a keen sense of smell is grabbing things you need. I was working on a drive exciter which needs electrolytic fluid to operate. The exciter can be a little finicky to reassemble as you need to hold the outer housing in place, then pour a small amount of the electrolytic fluid down the bolt hole to prevent air bubbles when you assemble and then fill with fluid. 

I hadn’t put the bottle of fluid on my workbench and would need to pick it up from my bin of fluids. For humans, this would mean taking your eyes and a hand off the project to grab the right one. Doing that would risk the cover plate getting out of alignment. I simply reached down to the bin with my tail, grabbed a bottle and brought it up to my nose. A quick sniff told me that it was antifreeze.

It was just two more blind grabs and sniffs to get the correct bottle of electrolytic fluid, all the while I was able to adjust the plate into perfect position. Holding the plate in place with my left hand, I grabbed the fluid with my right and used my finger and a thumb to unscrew the thankfully not over-tightened cap.

Should I have put the fluid bottle on my bench and had it open before aligning the drive plate? Probably. But grab and sniff works well enough. I got the required fluid into the bolt hole to prevent air bubbles without much extra difficulty. The remaining assembly was fast and I filled up the exciter with fluid. The remainder of my time before the mandatory briefing would be testing and tuning the exciter to get it back into spec with the fresh electrolytic. 

This didn’t mean the process didn’t go off without incident. Rosa caught what I had done and stood at the end of my station with a grumpy look. Her gaze alternated between my tail and my eyes.

“You’re cheating again,” she said flatly. “One of these days we’ll do some proper testing of that tail to maximize repair efficiencies.”

“Not my fault evolution failed you and left you with only one thumb on each hand and no tail,” I responded with a smirk.

“Cheating!” she declared as she walked away.

The rest of the shift went without incident, and we all gathered to head to the shuttle bay for the mandatory briefing. Unsurprisingly, conversation turned to food and the post-briefing buffet.

“I hope they have the peanut butter cup topped donuts,” James said with a dreamy look in his eyes.

“Those would be awesome, but I’m hoping for snickerdoodles,” Rosa responded.

As we entered the shuttle bay, I was overwhelmed by smells. Sure, I could detect the buffet and some of the wonderful things it contained. However, mostly it was like walking into a wall of scents all fighting for attention. The worst aspect for me was just the confusion it created in my brain. Hints of Susan turned out just to be Andrea standing next to Andrew, with somebody else that used the same lotion as Susan. Rather than have any sense of who was in the room and where, I had to do the human thing - use my eyes.

The entire engineering team including myself let out a groan as we realized we were late, so the majority of the seats were already taken. We would have to break up and find seats rather than sit together.

I found a seat with the bridge crew and settled in for what promised to be a long briefing. Like most of the crew, I tuned out the briefing and mostly sat back and relaxed. While the briefing was mandatory, it was an administrative requirement the captain and Auggie had to follow. Realistically, all of us would rely on the written briefing officers would send out, which was actually more useful as department heads would highlight the important bits we would need to know.

As I sat there, the one pleasure I had was getting some good hints at what waited in the buffet. While the mix of human soaps and scents filled the shuttle bay, it’s a well known fact that good food rises above. Definitely pizza, and not the junky frozen boxed stuff they usually served. However, what caught my attention most was something truly a gift from the stars.

I smelled some sort of fruit concoction, a subtle mix of orange blossoms, citrus, florals, and hints of spice that was absolutely heavenly. I sat back and closed my eyes, tuning out the briefing and breathing deep enjoying the scent.

“Hey, Haasha!” Katie said in a worried whisper. “Are you okay?”

I opened my eyes and looked up at her, and she intentionally looked down at the seat of my chair then back up into my eyes. I looked down and got just a smidge embarrassed as I realized I had been drooling at the thought of whatever fruit concoction the chef’s had come up with. My puddle of drool not only soaked the edge of my chair, but also had gotten onto Katie’s pants.

“Sorry!” I said while crouching down a little bit sheepishly. “Whatever orangey pastry or thing the kitchen came up with for today. It smells absolutely amazing, and I can’t wait to try it.”

“Oh,” Katie said with shock and embarrassment. “That’s not lunch. That’s my hair. I got a new shampoo infused with natural essential oils. It’s called ‘Orange Spice and Everything Nice’ and I’m sure the manufacturer would be flattered to find out you approve of it.”

She then leaned down, tilted her head towards me, and let her long hair hang closer to my nose. The smell got noticeably stronger.

“I could eat your hair,” I said absently which earned me a giggle from Katie and a number of “shushes” from the people around us. 

At the end of the briefing, Katie let me up on her shoulders so I could take a moment to bury my nose in her hair and get a good smell. It was absolutely amazing, and I’d have to send a message to Rashaak, Max, and Max to see if they could come up with a pastry or other food that smelled and tasted like this. If they could, I have a feeling it would be a smash hit with humans and Py’rapt’ch alike.

I thanked her for indulging my nose and wished her a good day so I could head off and get a full plate of happy. Freed from her hair, I was able to find that my smell-o-vision hadn’t led me completely astray and there was indeed fresh pizza. I grabbed a slice and also found a bowl of fruit salad that was hands down the best mix the chefs had ever put together.

As I sat down to eat, I let out a deep sigh as I took a large bite of the fruit salad.

Susan saw me, and noticed I looked a bit disappointed.

“Haasha!” she called out as she approached with a worried expression. “Is everything okay?”

“This is really good,” I began as I motioned to my plate of food. “But it just doesn’t taste as good as Katie’s hair.”

My boss, let's call him “Richard,” is a classic micromanager who skimps on paper clips but spends a ton of money on pointless corporate parties that no one likes.

Last week, Richard saw that my phone was charging from my work laptop. He threw a real tantrum. He started yelling that electricity costs money, that I was stealing “company resources,” and that if each of the 50 employees charged their phones, the company would go bankrupt.

He sent an official email to all employees with the subject line “PROHIBITION OF THE USE OF ELECTRICITY FOR PERSONAL PURPOSES,” in which he emphasized in bold that charging personal gadgets is prohibited and will result in fines.

Okay, Richard. Challenge accepted.

The thing is:

1 The company does not provide us with work phones.

2 To log into the CRM system, two-factor authentication is required (the code is sent to my phone).

3 Clients constantly call my messengers (Telegram, WhatsApp) because it is more convenient and faster than email. 

The next day, I came to work with my phone charged to 10% and at 10:40 my phone died.

At 10:55, an important client calls me on WhatsApp (I see the message on my laptop but cannot reply because I need my phone to confirm my login). I ignore it. 

At 11:00, I need to log into CRM to process a $20,000 shipment. The system asks for a code from the authenticator. My phone is off. I can't log in. 

I sit drinking coffee. 

Richard walks by and asks, ""Why aren't you working? 

Where's the shipping report?"" 

I calmly reply, “I can't log in. My phone is dead.”

Richard gets angry, “Then charge it.”

Me: I can't. According to your order from (date), using outlets for personal phones is theft and punishable by a fine. I don't want to steal from Richard's company.

He tried to argue that it was “for work,” but I showed him his email, which clearly stated, “No exceptions.”

Result:

The shipment was delayed for a day, the customer got angry and demanded a discount. Richard had to run to the store and buy power banks for me and two other colleagues who supported the protest, at the company's expense, registering them as office equipment.

Now I have a legal power bank, and Richard no longer looks in the direction of my outlets.

As a result, the boss saved 5 cents on electricity, which caused us to lose a $20,000 order, and now he buys us equipment.",7,1771018106.0,pointless,8,0.65,False

I’m a huge nerd who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. It’s been an amazing community for me, and I’ve met some great friends through it. I cosplay characters like Eddie Munson from Stranger Things and Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and oddly enough, I’m freakishly lucky with raffles and giveaways (no clue why, but I’ll take it).

I’m looking for someone kind, patient, and down-to-earth. You don’t need to cosplay — just be someone who enjoys nerdy stuff or at least doesn’t mind it. I’m not expecting perfection; I just want a genuine connection with someone who understands what it’s like to navigate dating later than most.

If you’re local, maybe we could start with something simple like coffee. No pressure — just two people seeing if there’s a spark.

1r41lwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1r41lwn/i_answered/,I Answered,"I knew the rules. 

As a kid growing up in the mountains of Garrett County, you hear many tall tales. Everyone’s grandfather saw a “black mountain lion” so you *know* mountain lions are still in the area even if the Wildlife and Fisheries Department says they aren’t, everyone knows someone who claims to have seen the legendary Mothman (even though Point Pleasant is three hours away), cousin so-and-so *totally* caught sight of Bigfoot on a trail cam, and many others with varying degrees of plausibility. It makes camping trips fun and memorable for kids as they all jump at shadows and question every sound that the cool mountain night produces. However, there is one piece of wisdom that is always shared with the utmost seriousness. 

“If you see something—no, you didn't. And if you hear something—no, you didn't.”

For the uninitiated, the deep woods of Appalachia are a strange and often spooky place. It is not uncommon to be out in the woods and hear a sound that you don’t recognize, or worse, a sound that you feel like you *do.* There are stories of people hearing something that sounds vaguely like a child crying. Your first instinct is to call out to the child or search for their location. It is only when you stop and think about where you are that you realize the oddity of it. Why would a child be this deep in the forest? Is it possible that a kid wandered out ten or more miles from the nearest campground? Perhaps, but the likelihood remains relatively low. It is best to go back to your vehicle and report what you heard and where you heard it to the authorities. That way, if a kid is missing, they know where to look, and if there isn’t, then you may have just saved your skin…literally. 

It is somewhat rarer to *see* something out of the ordinary, but it does happen enough that the warning still applies. Stories of hunters seeing deer with necks bent at odd angles or walking in circles, or even on their hind legs, are the sightings that most people are familiar with. Staring intently at these oddities or even approaching them to get a better look is likely to be the first move for many people. Humans are just curious like that, but that curiosity is dangerous. Again, the best course of action would be to simply return to your vehicle and report it. If it is a deer with chronic wasting disease, then the Natural Resource Officers will deal with it. Honestly, whether that deer has CWD or is some Appalachian horror in disguise, reporting it to someone else and leaving is the best option.

I grew up hearing those warnings all my life, and I ate them up as a kid. I would lie awake in my tent, expecting every cricket and hoot owl to be the harbinger of my demise. As I got older, I became the one to tell the stories and give the warnings to the next generation. Making sure that they all knew that staring too long at or speaking out to the wrong creature might spell their doom. Despite the intensity that I would give these warnings, I no longer gave them any credence. I did not truly believe that unknown monsters were lurking on the ridges and in the hollows of Appalachia. If someone had asked me what I thought, I would have said that I agreed that there are often weird sounds and animals in the woods, but there is always a rational explanation for them. Birds make all kinds of weird sounds, and some can mimic human voices. Some animals, especially deer, can survive some horrific injuries and diseases that make them look and act oddly. I genuinely believed that all the stories and warnings I heard growing up were simply rooted in people’s love for telling tales. To top it all off, I was raised in the church as the son of a Husband and Wife youth pastor team. I was a good ol’ mountain Pentecostal. Tongue talkin’ and faith walkin’. My mentality to all things supernatural could be summed up in the song *No Monsters* by Carmen. I firmly believed that  “Greater is HE that is in ME!” was the ticket to making me impervious to all spiritual entities. While this is theologically true, the prideful way in which I applied it to my life made me reckless and dismissive of the wisdom of the stories that were passed on to me. 

My family and I had recently moved just north of my childhood hometown in Maryland to a small township in Pennsylvania. My wife was not much of a hunter, and she was more than willing to stay home with our daughter while I went out to try to put some meat in the freezer. I did not know anyone in the area who owned land that I could use, so I had to resort to using state land. This was not ideal, and that notion was reinforced when I went out on the opening day of rifle season. I arrived in the wee hours of the morning at the nearest state game land only to find the entire ridgeline speckled with bright orange. The land was saturated with other hunters who had awoken and made the trek into the woods before I had a chance to claim a spot. I returned home disheartened as we needed the meat, but I knew that no deer would be within 5 miles of that area. I was venting my frustrations to my neighbor, who lived a few units down from me, and I was delighted to hear from him that there was an area that few locals would visit due to some local superstitions. The story went that some young boys went out hunting there and got lost. They were later found, frozen by the cold, and eaten by the animals. Since then, local hunters have avoided that area. Some do it out of respect, and others out of fear. My neighbor said that growing up, he and his brother would go out there to hunt and explore since so few other hunters from the area went out that way. He never saw a sign of any odd goings on, but did mention that the wind would sometimes gust really hard down in the hollow. He figured it was because of how the mountains were shaped. I thanked him for the story, but decades-old missing 411 stories weren’t my preferred type of campfire story. Since I did not know the families of those long-lost boys, and I wasn’t scared of a little wind, I asked him where this state gameland was. He said it was just down the road, about 10 miles on old Route 40, and I would know when to turn off when I see the old burnt-out church. 

It was a freezing Saturday morning in December when I set out for the woods. A thin layer of fresh powder had fallen overnight, coating the world in a peaceful blanket of white. The directions my neighbor gave me were easy to follow, and sure enough, I saw the blackened skeleton of what looked to be an old Methodist church by the rickety sign out front. The trail wasn’t too hard on my car (yes, it was a car, I couldn’t afford a truck), and in no time I found the parking area to the state game lands. I put my orange on, loaded my rifle, grabbed my thermos of coffee, and set out. After about ten to twenty minutes of sneaking out into the forest, I found my spot. A tall red oak on the side of the hill. The perfect vantage point to look down into the hollow below or up the ridge behind me. I kicked out an area at the base of the tree, set down my thermos, and breathed in the frigid morning air.  

There is something magical about being in the woods before daylight, leaning up against a tree, listening as intently as possible to every sound the forest makes. You get to watch the world wake up, and you feel so close to nature and the God that created it. I would almost call it a holy experience. I heard all the typical sounds that come with sunrise. First, the chickadees start chirping and chase each other through the brush. Many of them fly close to you to see what you are up to, as they are some of the boldest little birds I know of. Then the crows start their cawing to announce that it's time to wake up. Lastly, the squirrels start their devious hopping in the leaves to make you constantly think a deer is walking nearby. All the while, a gentle breeze blows as the air warms. Those moments were the best part of hunting for me, and I miss them.

As the sun rose into the sky, I found myself a little annoyed. Normally, around this time in the day is when I like to set my rifle across my lap and take a little power nap while sitting propped up against a tree (I know for a fact you other hunters do it too, don’t judge me). However, the freezing temperatures had me wide awake. I *hate* being cold, as it saps all the enjoyment out of any experience. My feet were already numb despite my thick socks and boots, and I was doing my best to stay quiet while I shifted my feet to get some blood moving. Even more regrettably, a cloud drifted over the sun, and the entire forest went silent. No wind. No birds. No squirrels. Perfect stillness and silence. That is when I heard it. A soft and gentle whisper spoken just inches from my ear said: 

“Hey”

My breath caught, and my head immediately swiveled around to see who was behind me. There was nobody there. I knew that I would have heard if someone sneaked up on me. So, I shrugged it off, assuming that it was just a Grey Catbird hiding in a nearby tree, mimicking something it heard. A few minutes pass, and I hear it again. Clear as can be:

“Hey”

Again, I looked around and saw nothing. I knew I had heard something. Maybe another hunter was nearby and I just didn’t see him when I walked in. I’d hate to be that guy who posts up a few yards from another hunter and just stays there like a jerk. I called back out to the voice to see where this other hunter was.

“Hello?”

As soon as I said it, I knew I had made a grave mistake. I realized that I was in the middle of nowhere. The gravel road I came down is the only access point to this area for miles, and when I had turned onto it from the main road, the snow was undisturbed. I was not so far away from the parking area that I would not have heard a vehicle pull up. The likelihood of another hunter being this far out in the woods this early in the morning without me hearing or seeing them was extremely low. I felt a growing sense of worry welling up inside me as a biting wind began to blow and swirl around me, kicking up the fresh snow and dead leaves. That was the moment all those campfire stories came flooding back to me. Doing my best to shrug off the wind and its numbing chill, I immediately readied my rifle, flicked off the safety, and started scanning the forest all around me. Every fallen log, tree branch, and rock pile was a suspect. If there was even a chance that someone or something could hide near me, I wanted to be on guard. I saw nothing, but I *felt* it. The wind was wrong; it didn’t blow logically. Only the trees in my vicinity were being affected by the wind. It swirled and gusted around me instead of blowing straight down the hollow like normal. I stood there perplexed and anxious by this fell wind and the careless mistake I just made. That is when I heard the voice again:

“Wretch.”

In an instant, I felt my chest tighten with emotion. Sorrow and pain stabbed right through my heart. An agony I have only felt in my lowest and most vulnerable moments once again raised its ugly head. Times in my life when all I could see was death and darkness, no matter where I turned. The icy wind seemed to permeate my very being and brought to bear every moment of grief and sadness that I ever knew. The weight of all those forlorn memories was so heavy upon my soul that it caused physical pain. My first thought was to pray; God had carried me through those times when death felt like the only way to end my pain, and I *knew* that he would carry me through this now. I began my prayer:

“Dear Heavenly Father…”

Before my prayer could completely leave my lips, the unknown speaker shouted,

“SINNER!”

The pit of my stomach fell out, and I doubled over. A feeling of guilt so intense it made me sick to my stomach. Other memories from my past flashed before my eyes. Now, instead of just reliving my lowest moments, I had to see myself for who I truly am.  I watched myself commit every iniquity all over again. I bore witness to the evil that was my humanity. Shame cascaded over me as any assurance that I had in my salvation shattered. The deep sorrow constricted in my chest, and the guilt radiated in my stomach, sapping all my remaining strength and bringing me to my knees. I wept on the forest floor with not a single sound besides my sobs echoing through the hollow. Only the divine could free me from this all-consuming anguish. Grasping for even the smallest mustard seed of faith I had left, I tried to pray again, but what came out was not of me or God.

“L-lord.. of the powers of the Air, help.”

The words did not even register in my mind as I spoke them into the wind. A cry for help that was not directed to my God, but rather something or someone else. It was not until much later that I was able to recall what was even spoken in that second prayer. I sincerely hope that if the true nature of those profane words had registered in my mind, I would have been shaken from my stupor. All I know is that at that time, I just wanted the pain to end. I wanted someone to reach out a hand and lift me out of my torment. My mind swam through the mire of feelings and thoughts that rendered any mental fortification and rational thought powerless. An unholy bombardment of condemnation fell upon me as, internally, I heard my voice betray me. 

“What right did this corrupted, sinful human have to be out in God’s creation? How could such a lowly worm deserve the privilege of harvesting one of his beloved creatures to satiate its lustful hunger? Who was this abomination that perverted the beauty of the sunrise and the morning birdsong with its presence? A miserable, lowly, selfish waste of flesh. Woe to the woman and child who call this *man* husband and father. For he will surely lead them down the path of damnation.”

The deluge of self-doubt and loathing was overwhelming. Each new assertion chipped away at my faith. I once believed that I was the wise man who built his house upon the rock, but at this moment, I saw that even the strongest rock can be ground down to sand. I could feel consciousness slipping as the weight of it all was breaking me. God felt so distant in that moment. A chasm had opened itself between my wretched immortal soul and the Almighty. One such as myself was in no position to reach out and ask for his assistance. I was alone, wallowing in the distilled anguish consuming my mind and body. The cacophony of castigation reached its crescendo when that same soft voice whispered a new word.“Blood”All at once, my mind felt clear. The unrest and pain consuming my being had been replaced with a gentle numbness. One would hesitate to call it “peace” as the pain was still there, floating at the back of my mind, but I no longer worried about it. The answer that would solve all my problems had been spoken to me by the voice on the wind. Blood. All that was needed to end my suffering was my blood. In nature, the weak and sick member of the herd is the offering that protects the herd. The predator won’t go after the young or the healthy if the sick and weak are left behind and offered up as a blood offering. Deep down at the core of my being, I knew that I was a wretched, wicked creature. My very soul was sick, and my flesh was weak. This failing could only be cleansed with blood. By giving myself up, I would be protecting my wife and daughter. I came out to the woods to feed them, but by dying out here, I would be protecting them from God’s wrath. Surely, God’s creation would find better use for my blood and meat than I ever could. Then his beloved son, the great prince of the air, would be pleased with my tribute. Only in the glory of the Son of the Morning could I find my peace. I was still on my knees with tears streaming down my face, but in that moment, my mind felt clear. I pulled my Buck knife from my belt and held it out in front of me. I was ready to die, and I could only hope my blood would be enough. 

It was the sun that saved me. As the clouds finally drifted past, the light of the late morning sun fell on my face and warmed my cheeks. I was blinded by the sun's glare reflected off my blade, and I jerked awake from the trance that had consumed me. What was I thinking? What was I doing? Why was I killing myself for “the prince of the air”? That name felt oddly familiar, but in my current mental state, I could not focus on that. I knew I had to leave now or else I would not make it out of this forest alive. I could already feel the weight of the pain and guilt drifting back down onto me. 

I ran for my vehicle, leaving my rifle and knife in the dirt. The whispering turned to shrieks and became frantic. The wind itself went from swirling around me to blowing directly in my face, blinding me and pushing me back. The voice screamed: “Hey, hey, hey, wretch, wretch, wretch, sinner, sinner, sinner.”

With some of my senses back, I leaned into my charismatic upbringing and began to pray in the spirit. It was all I could think to do to drown out the voice that threatened to break my mind and soul. I do not know if the prayers themselves did anything or if it was just a comfort for me, but I eventually made it to my car and peeled off down the trail. I continued to pray as the wind howled and shook my vehicle, threatening to blow me off the road. I could not see anything ahead of me as the wind caused a constant whiteout that threatened to thwart my escape. Luckily, the trail I was on was wide and laid with gravel, so I could “feel” my way down the road. The howling of the wind and revving of my engine did nothing to drown out the cries of the thing that spoke to me. Eventually, I passed that old decrepit church at the trail's head, and the wind and voice went silent as I drove away. 

As one can imagine, I have not gone hunting since. I can’t bring myself to go back out into those woods, and windy days fill me with anxiety. Even more so, I find myself struggling to pray in a meaningful way. Every time I try, the sorrow and guilt I felt on that forest floor flares up, similarly to how an old burn that is still healing hurts worse if it gets too close to a hot stove. It is not the same intensity as when it first happened, but it hurts enough that I still pull back. I have to move away from here. I don’t think that I will be able to fully recover if I stay in this area. I need to be somewhere with no woods around for things to lurk. I don’t think this “prince of the air” is done with me yet. Even as I write this, I swear there is a gentle “Hey?” drifting in the air.

I am not going to tell you that the devil lives in the backwoods of Appalachia, but I am not going to say that he doesn’t either. Let my story be a lesson, and please, heed the warnings of the legends and campfire tales.

I had to let her in the house cose it was cold outside, didn't let her in my room even tough she asked again. We sat on the couch she put her legs on mine and was telling me how we should get back together, tried to kiss me 3 times but stopped herself and we hugged and holded hands. She left the next day at 5 pm she called me to get dinner at our favorite restorant, on my way there she called again to ask for as to be just friendly. It was a short dinner 1 hour and she didn't want to talk about anything about our past like even the good thing, she tried to fist pump me but ended up hugging me at the end. It made me even more anxious cose she dropped me like a rock when she broke up with me and didn't give me much of a explanation, and every time she called or texted me before she only talked like friends not even taking in consideration my feeeling, she also did the same at that dinner. I drinked the next day and texted her I shouldn't have agreed on talking and that she is playing with me, we had a fight. Well it has being 5 days since and today I was driving my mom to work, my EX is striking at her job so they have coffee and food there she is in the service industry. On the way back I passed by the Strike and stopped to buy something to support it. It hit me the moment I saw her, I felt nothing emotionally not a single think. I wasn't happy to see her I didn't have any longing I wasn't afraid of loosing her forever. I just got coffee and left without feeling a thing. It took me a month and half to detach and the main reason was her coming back every week trying to talk like buddies or like try to get back together that also happened 2 days after we broke up for a day, I still loved her so I would agree every time, only to get the rug pulled underneathme every time. I guess I realized I don't need her in my life at all finally. Today was a stress test, cose I didn't know what I will feel when I see her again, it turned out it was nothing. The realization from me hurting so bad wanting to get back with her for over a month to me not wanting to have anything to do with her is amazing. I also feel good for a first time since the brake up. I hope all of as will get there eventually 🙏. ",3,1771017357.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Polite, young and even quietly patriotic to her adopted country, Zheng Siru presents as a hard-working bakery assistant serving coffees and buns to busy ­Canberrans.

But federal authorities allege the “peaceful life” Ms Zheng insists she leads is a facade – and that the 31-year-old with a shy smile is a Chinese Communist Party agent working surreptitiously to monitor members of Australia’s Chinese community.

Ms Zheng on Wednesday sat in the ACT Magistrates Court, charged as an alleged foreign spy together with a 25-year-old Chinese man who cannot be named for legal reasons.

Zheng Siru presents as a hard-working bakery assistant serving busy Canberrans. But federal authorities allege the ‘peaceful life’ Ms Zheng insists she leads is a facade.

Police accused the pair of collecting information on a Canberra Buddhist group for Beijing’s Public Security Bureau with another Chinese woman who was arrested in August. All three face charges of reckless foreign interference, which carries a maximum 15-year prison term.

The Australian approached Ms Zheng at her central Canberra workplace on August 15, as part of this newspaper’s inquiries into the alleged targeting of the Canberra branch of the Guan Yin Citta Buddhist Association, which the Chinese Communist Party considers an “evil cult”.

“It’s better for everyone to keep quiet now,” she said at the time.

Two alleged Chinese spies have been arrested in Canberra by the AFP.

Asked whether she worked as a spy for China and whether she was a police suspect in the case, Ms Zheng said the question was “over the line”.

“I understand you are doing your job … but for me I just want a peaceful life,“ she said.

“Australia is very good country and we’re very happy with all the things we have.”

When asked why she was being treated as a potential suspect, she said: “No, no, no, no, no. Let’s wait until all things (are) public.”

Details of the allegations against Ms Zheng were not aired in court.

Zheng Siru’s passport.

Her lawyer, Travis Jackson, said he had been handed a 57-page statement of facts by the police but “whether it’s actually fact or fiction is the question”.

Police alleged the 25-year-old man, who was given the pseudonym “Joseph Vance”, had since May 28, 2022 tasked associates to collect information and had engaged in conduct for a “foreign entity” to support the intelligence work of the People’s Republic of China.

Magistrate Glenn Theakston asked whether the facts and the names of the pair needed to be suppressed.

An Australian Federal Police representative requested a protection order for the documents “in the interest of national security”.

Alleged Chinese spies arrested

An order was granted banning publication of Mr Vance’s identity because it could expose other people connected to the case.

Lawyers for the pair said they would wait 24 hours to seek bail and the matter was adjourned until Thursday morning. Ms Zheng and Mr Vance were led back into custody by their lawyers.

The arrests were made as part of an AFP-ASIO operation called Operation Autumn-Shield.

They came after the first Chinese woman charged over the matter was granted bail in October by an ACT magistrate, who acknowledged there was an outside risk she might flee the country.

Prosecutors at the time argued the woman, who has significant “unexplained wealth” and a China-based husband who works for the Public Security Bureau, could have a fresh passport issued by Beijing allowing her to abscond. But the court ruled that the likelihood she would abscond or interfere with witnesses was not sufficient to deny her liberty.

Announcing the charges against Ms Zheng and Mr Vance, AFP Assistant Commissioner Stephen Nutt said foreign interference was a serious crime that undermined democracy and social cohesion.

“Australia is not immune to foreign interference, and we should not expect this arrest will prevent further attempts to target our diaspora communities,” Mr Nutt said. “Members of our culturally and linguistically diverse communities are more likely to be victims of foreign interference or transnational repression than to be offenders.”

ASIO director-general Mike Burgess said foreign interference remained one of Australia’s principal security concerns.

“A complex, challenging and changing security environment is becoming more dynamic, diverse and degraded,” Mr Burgess said.

“Multiple foreign regimes are monitoring, harassing and intimidating members of our diaspora communities. This sort of behaviour is utterly unacceptable and cannot be tolerated.”

Guan Yin Citta has clandestine centres in mainland China, as well as associations in the US, Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan.

1r41e5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1r41e5o/youre_probably_hotter_than_you_think_the/,You're Probably Hotter Than You Think: The Psychology Behind Signs You Keep Missing,"Look, I've spent way too much time studying human behavior, attraction psychology, and evolutionary biology (thanks grad school). And here's what blows my mind: most genuinely attractive people have zero clue they're attractive. Meanwhile, some mid folks walk around with unshakeable confidence. Wild, right?

Here's the thing though. Our brains are wired to focus on our flaws. It's called negativity bias, and it's been documented in tons of research. Basically, your brain is doing you dirty by making you hyperfocus on that one asymmetrical eyebrow while completely ignoring the fact that strangers keep staring at you in coffee shops.

I've researched this topic extensively through psychology journals, podcasts like Huberman Lab, and books on evolutionary psychology. Turns out, attraction operates on way more levels than we realize, and the signs are everywhere if you know what to look for.

**People remember you after brief interactions.** This is huge. If acquaintances bring up specific things you said weeks ago, or if someone's friend mentions ""oh yeah, [your name], I remember you"", that's a major indicator. Our brains are selective about what we encode into memory, and attractive people get priority processing. It's not fair, but it's neuroscience. The book **The Like Switch** by Jack Schafer (former FBI agent who literally studied human behavior for a living) breaks down how we subconsciously prioritize attractive individuals in our mental filing system. This book is insanely good at explaining the tiny signals we miss.

**Strangers are oddly helpful toward you.** Notice how people go slightly out of their way for you? Holding doors longer, offering directions before you ask, or giving you extra samples at Costco? The halo effect is real and backed by decades of research. Attractive people are unconsciously treated better in everyday interactions. It's messed up from an equality standpoint, but it's a genuine indicator. If you find yourself thinking ""people are generally pretty nice"", consider that you might be experiencing pretty privilege without realizing it.

**You get accused of being flirty when you're just being normal.** If multiple people have told you this, especially people of the gender you're attracted to, congrats. You're probably hot. When you're attractive, your baseline friendly behavior gets interpreted as romantic interest because people are already primed to see you that way. The jealous partner who claims you were ""totally flirting"" with the barista when you just said thanks? Yeah, that's them picking up on how the barista responded to your face.

**People get weird around you initially then relax.** This manifests as nervousness, overcompensating humor, or being oddly formal before loosening up. I found this pattern fascinating while reading about social dynamics. If you notice people seem kind of stiff during first meetings but chill out after hanging a few times, they were likely intimidated by your appearance initially. The book **The Charisma Myth** by Olivia Fox Cabane (leadership consultant who's worked with everyone from Harvard to Google) has this great section on how attractive people inadvertently trigger performance anxiety in others. Best book I've read on understanding how others perceive you.

**You've been called intimidating despite being friendly.** This one confused me for years until i understood the psychology. When someone's attractive, their simple existence feels like a threat to others' self esteem. You could be the warmest person alive, but if you're good looking, some people will project their insecurities onto you and label you intimidating or stuck up. It's their defense mechanism, not your personality flaw.

**Children and dogs love you.** Sounds random but kids and animals don't have the social filters adults do. They're drawn to symmetrical faces and calm energy. There's legitimate research showing children preferentially look at attractive faces, even as infants. If random kids stare at you or dogs immediately trust you, your face might be hitting some evolutionary appeal buttons.

**Your self perception is weirdly disconnected from photos.** You look at pictures of yourself and think ""eh, I look okay I guess"" while your friends are like ""you look amazing."" This disconnect happens because you're overly familiar with your face. There's actually a studied phenomenon where we prefer our mirror image (what we see daily) over our true image (what others see). So photos feel ""off"" to you but look great to everyone else. It's why you hate your voice in recordings too.

**People assume you're in a relationship.** If you're constantly asked ""so what does your partner think about [whatever]"" or people seem surprised you're single, it's because attractive people are assumed to be partnered up. It's basic supply and demand logic playing out in social assumptions.

Look, I'm not saying any of this to be superficial. Attractiveness is subjective, multifaceted, and honestly not the most important thing about a person. But if you're sitting there thinking you're mid while exhibiting most of these signs, you're probably wrong about yourself.

The real mindfuck is that confidence and self perception influence attractiveness more than we realize. It's not just about bone structure. If you want to go deeper into understanding social dynamics and building genuine confidence, there's this smart learning app called BeFreed that pulls from psychology research, books like the ones mentioned above, and expert insights to create personalized learning plans. 

Here's what actually matters though: whether you're conventionally attractive or not, learning to see yourself accurately (not through a lens of distorted self criticism) is crucial for mental health. You're probably doing way better than you think in multiple areas of life, not just appearance.",1,1771017337.0,MotivationByDesign,0,1.0,False

# 🍻 Narrative Opening: The Night Begins at The Tipsy Griffin

The tavern door groans open as you push your way inside, the warm glow of lanternlight spilling over your small goblin frame. The air is thick with the scents of roasting meat, spilled ale, and something faintly magical — like cinnamon mixed with ozone. Perfect. Exactly the kind of place where a chef like you might sniff out a rare ingredient… or a new friend.

A burst of laughter rolls across the room as a group of dwarves clink tankards hard enough to chip the wood. A lute plays off‑key near the hearth, accompanied by someone who is either singing or casting a spell — it’s hard to tell which.

Above the bar hangs the tavern’s namesake: a massive wooden carving of a griffin mid‑pounce, its eyes following you a little too closely for comfort. Old Man Thatch insists the tavern is alive. Tonight, you’re not entirely sure he’s wrong.

You adjust the strap of your cast‑iron skillet and pat the pouch of experimental spices at your hip. The scroll of The Impossible Stew crackles faintly in your pack, as if eager for adventure.

Your goal is simple: make a new ally. Someone who can help you on your culinary quests. Someone who won’t run away when your spices start smoking.

The tavern hums with possibility.

Choose your starting point:

* The Hearthfire Lounge — warm, crowded, full of gossip and potential friends
* The Bar Counter — Mira Mugwhistle is pouring drinks and judging everyone
* The Back Tables — dim, shady, and perfect for overhearing secrets
* The Kitchen — chaotic, loud, and full of ingredients you probably shouldn’t touch
* The Cellar Door — slightly ajar… and definitely not supposed to be
* The Upstairs Landing — footsteps, whispers, and a flicker of candlelight

# 🔥 The Hearthfire Lounge: Where the Night Truly Begins

You weave your way into the Hearthfire Lounge, the warmest and loudest heart of The Tipsy Griffin. The great stone fireplace crackles with orange‑blue flames — the kind that suggest at least one fire spirit is on payroll — and the room is alive with overlapping conversations, clattering mugs, and the occasional magical pop from someone’s spell gone slightly sideways.

A wave of heat washes over your goblin skin, carrying with it the scent of roasted boar, honey‑glazed root vegetables, and something else… something sharp and citrusy that makes your spice pouch wiggle with interest.

A cluster of dwarves are arm‑wrestling on a table reinforced with iron bands. A trio of elves are arguing about whose hair is “most ethereal.” A bard is performing a ballad about a heroic turnip. And near the fire, perched on a cushioned stool like royalty, sits—

Sir Puddleton.  
 A talking cat. Wearing a knight’s helm. Polishing a tiny sword with one paw while sipping warm milk from a goblet.

He glances up at you with regal disdain… then curiosity.

Across the room, Grunk the half‑ogre bouncer is reciting poetry to a pair of giggling pixies. He spots you, gives a friendly wave, and nearly knocks over a table with his elbow.

And just as you’re taking it all in, a barmaid rushes past carrying a tray of drinks that are… floating slightly above the tray. She mutters, “Not again,” as she tries to swat them back down.

The room is bursting with potential allies — and potential disasters.

Choose your first interaction:

* Sir Puddleton, the knightly cat with a suspiciously shiny sword
* Grunk, the gentle half‑ogre poet
* The dwarven arm‑wrestlers, who look like they’d welcome a challenger
* The floating drinks, which seem to be escaping for a reason
* The bard, whose heroic turnip song is… questionable
* Someone else in the lounge — describe who you approach

# 💪 The Dwarven Arm‑Wrestlers: A Test of Strength… or Ingenuity

You march toward the iron‑banded table, where two dwarves are locked in a titanic struggle of muscle, beard, and sheer stubbornness. The wood creaks. The iron groans. One dwarf’s mustache is vibrating with effort.

As you approach, both dwarves glance up — without stopping the match.

The one on the left, a stocky fellow with braids thick enough to use as rope, grins wide.  
 “Oi! A goblin! Haven’t had one o’ you challenge us in ages.”

The dwarf on the right, whose beard is tucked into his belt for “aerodynamics,” snorts.  
 “Last goblin tried to use oil on the table. Slipped right off. Funniest thing I’ve seen all week.”

A small crowd gathers, sensing entertainment.

The braided dwarf jerks his chin at you.  
 “Fancy a go, lad? Winner gets braggin’ rights and a free drink from Mira.”

The aerodynamic dwarf adds, “And loser gets mocked mercilessly, but in good spirits.”

Your skillet feels heavy at your side. Your Lucky trait tingles. This could be a chance to impress someone… or at least make them laugh.

Choose your style:

* Challenge them directly — pure goblin grit
* Use your Lucky trait — trust fate to guide your tiny arm
* Use your Chef skills — maybe your spices can help… somehow
* Distract them with fast-talking goblin charm
* Do something chaotic — you are in a tavern



# 🍀 Gribble Trusts His Luck

You plant your tiny green elbow on the iron‑banded table. The dwarves lean in, grinning like they’ve already won. The crowd hushes. Someone whispers, “Oh this’ll be good.”

You don’t flex.  
 You don’t posture.  
 You simply believe — in the strange, improbable, occasionally explosive force that has guided you through every kitchen disaster and culinary miracle.

Your Lucky trait hums like a kettle about to boil.

The braided dwarf clasps your hand.  
 “Ready, lad?”

You nod.

He counts down.  
 “Three… two… one— GO!”





# 🎲 Rolling with Luck…

Your arm immediately bends backward at an angle that would alarm any reasonable creature. The crowd gasps. Someone shouts, “He’s gonna snap like a breadstick!”

But then—

Your spice pouch bursts open with a tiny poof, releasing a cloud of shimmering paprika‑gold dust. It swirls dramatically around the table, sparkles catching the firelight.

The aerodynamic dwarf inhales sharply.  
 “By Moradin’s beard— that smells like my grandmother’s roast!”

He’s so overwhelmed by nostalgia that he loosens his grip on his opponent’s hand. The braided dwarf, startled, jerks his arm— and accidentally slams his own hand to the table.

The room erupts.

“THE GOBLIN WINS!”  
 “WHAT JUST HAPPENED?”  
 “THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL!”

The dwarves stare at you, stunned… then burst into hearty laughter.

The braided dwarf claps you on the back hard enough to rattle your bones.  
 “Lad, that was the luckiest, strangest victory I’ve ever seen. You’ve earned that drink!”

The aerodynamic dwarf wipes a sentimental tear.  
 “And that spice… what was that? Reminded me of home.”

This might be your chance to make an ally.





Choose your next move:

* Share your spices and bond over cooking
* Ask them about rare ingredients they’ve encountered
* Invite them to join you on a culinary quest
* Use the moment to ask about tavern rumors
* Do something chaotic now that you’ve got their attention

# 🍲 A Culinary Quest Begins

You hop up onto a nearby stool so you’re closer to eye level with the dwarves. Your spice pouch still sparkles faintly from its earlier eruption, giving you an oddly heroic glow. The dwarves lean in, curious, tankards in hand.

You clear your throat with dramatic goblin gravitas.

“Gentledwarves,” you begin, “I am on a culinary quest — a journey to discover flavors so bold, so daring, so mouth‑watering that even the gods loosen their belts. And I could use stout‑armed companions with good taste and better beards.”

The braided dwarf’s eyebrows shoot up.  
 “A quest, eh? Involvin’ food?”

The aerodynamic dwarf strokes his beard thoughtfully.  
 “Does it involve eatin’? Or fightin’? Or both?”

You grin.  
 “Oh, absolutely both.”

The dwarves exchange a look — the kind of look that precedes either a great adventure or a regrettable decision. With dwarves, those are often the same thing.

The braided dwarf slams his tankard down.  
 “Name’s Borin Barrelbraids, lad. And I’m in. Haven’t had a proper quest since the Great Pickle Catastrophe.”

The aerodynamic dwarf nods vigorously.  
 “I’m Durnan Beltbeard. If your spices can make me cry like my grandmother’s roast again, I’ll follow you to the ends of the realm.”

A small cheer rises from the onlookers. You’ve done it — you’ve made not one but two potential allies.

Just then, Mira Mugwhistle the bartender calls out from across the room:  
 “Gribble! If you’re recruiting dwarves for anything involving fire, explosions, or cooking, I want advance notice!”

The dwarves grin at you.  
 “So, chef,” Borin says, “what’s the first step of this grand culinary quest of yours?”





Choose your direction:

* Reveal the recipe for The Impossible Stew and seek ingredients
* Ask the dwarves about rare ingredients they’ve encountered
* Propose a small “test mission” in the tavern kitchen
* Investigate that strange citrusy smell from earlier
* Let chaos guide the next step

Your new allies await your lead.

# 📜 The Impossible Stew Is Revealed

You glance left, then right, then dramatically pull the scroll from your pack. The parchment crackles with faint magical heat — as if it knows it’s about to cause trouble.

Borin and Durnan lean in so close their beards brush the table.

You unfurl the scroll.

The runes shimmer. The ink glows. A faint whomp of arcane kitchen energy pulses outward, ruffling beards and singeing a few nearby eyebrows.

Borin whistles.  
 “By the Stonefather… that’s a recipe or a prophecy.”

Durnan squints.  
 “Or a warning.”

You clear your throat and read aloud:

THE IMPOSSIBLE STEW  
 A dish of legend. A flavor beyond mortal reach. Requires ingredients that defy nature, common sense, and tavern safety regulations.

The dwarves exchange a look that says excellent.

You continue, pointing to each glowing line:

# Ingredients Needed

* 1 Ember Pepper — grows only near open flame… or inside it
* A Splash of Moonlit Broth — must be collected under actual moonlight
* Shavings of Thunderroot — hums when held, shocks when chopped
* One Citrus of Uncertain Origin — the scroll refuses to elaborate
* A Pinch of Willing Chaos — whatever that means

The dwarves nod solemnly, as if this is all perfectly reasonable.

Then Borin slaps the table.  
 “Well then! We’ll need to track these down. Where do we start, chef?”

Durnan adds, “I did smell something citrusy earlier… thought it was someone’s cologne.”

Your spice pouch wiggles again. Something in this tavern is calling to the recipe.





Where does Gribble lead his new dwarven allies?

* Investigate that strange citrusy smell — maybe the first ingredient is already nearby
* Head to the Kitchen — Ember Peppers might be hiding near the fire
* Ask Mira the bartender — she knows every ingredient that passes through this place
* Check the Cellar — Thunderroot sometimes grows in… questionable environments
* Let the scroll guide you — hold it up and see where it pulls

# 🍋 The Citrus Trail Begins

You lift your goblin nose and sniff — once, twice, then a rapid series of sniffs like a bloodhound who’s had too much coffee.  
 The dwarves watch with rapt fascination.

Borin whispers, “He’s scent‑tracking.”  
 Durnan nods. “Aye. Like a truffle boar, but… greener.”

The citrus smell sharpens, bright and zesty, cutting through the tavern’s haze of ale and roasted meat. Your spice pouch wiggles again, this time with real urgency — like it’s trying to leap off your belt and chase the scent itself.

You follow the trail through the Hearthfire Lounge, weaving between chairs and dodging a floating mug that’s given up on being caught. The dwarves lumber behind you, knocking over only two stools, which is impressive restraint for dwarves on a mission.

The scent grows stronger as you approach the fireplace — the great stone hearth where blue‑orange flames dance like they’re enjoying the music. And sitting right beside it, perched on a low table, is…

A bowl of fruit.

But not normal fruit.

One of the oranges is glowing.  
 Faintly.  
 Rhythmically.  
 Like a heartbeat.

Durnan leans in. “That’s… not natural.”  
 Borin pokes it with a finger. “Feels warm. Like it’s thinkin’ about somethin’.”

Your spice pouch practically vibrates off your hip.

This could be it — the Citrus of Uncertain Origin.

But before you can grab it, a voice behind you clears their throat.

A tall, robed figure stands there, arms crossed, expression unimpressed.  
 It’s Ezzira, the dramatic sorceress known for entering every room like she’s on stage.

“That,” she says, pointing at the glowing citrus, “is my experimental Arcano‑Clementine. And I’m not sure it’s safe for… culinary purposes.”

The fruit pulses brighter, as if offended.





How does Gribble handle this magical citrus situation?

* Attempt to negotiate with Ezzira — appeal to her dramatic flair
* Explain the Impossible Stew and ask for her help
* Try to snatch the citrus quickly (risky, chaotic, very goblin)
* Offer a trade — spices for sorcery
* Let the dwarves handle the diplomacy
* Let chaos decide — poke the citrus and see what happens

# 🎭 Gribble Makes His Case

You straighten your chef’s hat (which wasn’t on your head a moment ago, but appears when you need dramatic effect) and step between Ezzira and the glowing Arcano‑Clementine.

With a flourish worthy of a stage magician, you unfurl the scroll again. The runes shimmer. The citrus pulses. The dwarves lean in like children at story time.

“Ezzira,” you begin, “I seek to create The Impossible Stew — a dish so legendary it requires ingredients that bend reality, defy logic, and occasionally explode. And I believe your Arcano‑Clementine may be the Citrus of Uncertain Origin the recipe demands.”

Ezzira raises a perfectly sculpted eyebrow.  
 “My fruit is not meant for… cooking. It is a delicate arcane experiment.”

The citrus pulses brighter, as if offended again.

You continue, undeterred.  
 “This stew is more than food. It’s art. It’s magic. It’s destiny simmered over low heat. And I could use the help of someone with your… dramatic flair.”

Borin nods vigorously.  
 “Aye! And if it explodes, we’ll help clean up. Probably.”

Durnan adds, “And we’ll taste‑test. For safety.”

Ezzira looks between the three of you — a goblin chef vibrating with enthusiasm, two dwarves radiating chaotic optimism, and a glowing citrus fruit that seems increasingly eager to be part of something.

She sighs the sigh of someone who knows she’s about to make a questionable decision.

“Fine,” she says, “but only if I supervise. That fruit is unstable. It may teleport. Or sing. Or attempt to unionize.”

The citrus emits a tiny ping like a tuning fork.

Ezzira picks it up delicately and hands it to you.  
 “Handle it gently. And if it starts humming in a minor key, put it down immediately.”

You now have:

# ✨ Ingredient Acquired: Citrus of Uncertain Origin

The scroll glows approvingly.





Where do you lead your growing party next?

* The Kitchen — to hunt for Ember Peppers near the flames
* The Cellar — Thunderroot often lurks where it shouldn’t
* Outside under the moonlight — to collect Moonlit Broth
* Ask Mira the bartender — she might know where chaos can be found
* Let the scroll guide you again — see where it tugs

Your stew is one ingredient closer to reality.

# 🍺 Seeking Chaos: Consulting Mira Mugwhistle

With the glowing Arcano‑Clementine tucked carefully into your pack (where it hums like a smug bumblebee), you lead your dwarven companions and Ezzira toward the bar.

Mira Mugwhistle is mid‑pour, balancing three tankards in one hand while scolding a floating mug with the other. She spots you approaching and narrows her eyes in the way only a halfling bartender who has seen everything can.

“Oh no,” she says, setting the tankards down. “You’ve got that look again, Gribble. The ‘I’m about to ask something dangerous’ look.”

Borin beams.  
 “He’s makin’ a stew!”

Durnan adds, “A legendary one!”

Ezzira sighs.  
 “And I’ve agreed to supervise.”

Mira pinches the bridge of her nose.  
 “Wonderful. What ingredient are you after now? Something flammable? Something illegal? Something that bites back?”

You hop up onto a barstool, your spice pouch giving a hopeful wiggle.

“Mira,” you say with your most winning goblin grin, “I need a Pinch of Willing Chaos.”

The bar goes quiet.

A few patrons turn their heads. Someone drops a spoon. The floating mug stops trying to escape.

Mira stares at you for a long moment, then bursts out laughing.

“Oh, Gribble. You don’t find chaos in this tavern. Chaos finds you.”

She leans in conspiratorially.

“But if you’re looking for a concentrated, portable, semi‑cooperative form of chaos… there’s only one place to check.”

She points toward the back of the tavern, where a small door sits slightly ajar. A faint buzzing, clattering, and occasional bang echoes from behind it.

Fizzletop’s Workshop.

The gnome inventor whose gadgets explode 40% of the time.

“Tell him I sent you,” Mira says. “And try not to touch anything glowing, spinning, or singing.”

The dwarves exchange excited looks.  
 Ezzira mutters, “This is a terrible idea.”  
 Your spice pouch wiggles in agreement — which for you means excellent idea.

The first brew of the stuff was incredible but I haven’t quite captured that experience since. 

I froze the beans in vacuum sealed freezer bags and the first batch I thawed was fragrant but quite flat in terms of flavor no matter how I brew — aeropress, Hario switch immersion + classic v60, moka, etc.

My partner and I will be honeymooning in Hawaii in May. He has never been to Hawaii, and I haven’t been in almost 10 years! I know a lot of things have changed since then, but there are a lot of things we definitely want to do (listed below). 

We’ll be in Oahu for 6.5 days before we head over to Maui for the rest of our trip, and we’re going to be staying in waikiki and renting a car. I’m not sure where everything is on the island, and we want to be intentional about maximizing our time! 

Any advice, recommendations, etc would be very appreciated! I am trying to get ahead of planning our itinerary since I know a lot of things require reservations/ planning ahead. Additionally, we are both huge foodies and are excited to eat a ton of musubis, poke, açaí, and try new things. Coffee lovers as well. We also are (obviously) huge beach lovers, so please lmk the best ones to visit where we can lounge and swim! Unfortunately we don’t surf but wouldn’t mind watching others catch waves :) 

Some of the things we definitely plan to do:

\- Kualoa ranch. Huge Jurassic park fans, so this is at the top of our list and we’re willing to splurge. What is the best tour to book? UTV raptor one? We’d love to see all of the movie/tv sights as well if possible 

\- swap meet at the football stadium 

\- diamond head 

\- day on the north shore, or should we spend 2 days? This was my favorite area from when I last visited! 

\- we would love to visit a botanical garden as well, lmk which one is best! 

Thanks so much! I think about this trip everyday; I am so excited to go back! ",2,1771017079.0,VisitingHawaii,8,0.67,False

# Chapter 1

Phantom

The plane hummed with that particular frequency that made most people drowsy. Not me. I’d never felt more awake in my life.

Seat 12A. Window side. Perfect view of the endless blue stretching beneath us as we climbed toward cruising altitude. I pressed my fingers against the cool glass, watching the ground fall away, taking sixteen years of my life with it. Sixteen years of blood, precision, and a perfect success rate that made my name whispered in the darkest corners of the world.

Phantom.

God, what a ridiculous alias. Like I was supposed to haunt people or some poetic bullshit. But that’s what you get when you let a bunch of dramatic assassins name you. The world’s number one killer—one hundred percent success rate, zero room for error—and they’d given me a name that sounded like a bad superhero movie.

I smiled at my reflection in the window.

“You have such a lovely smile!” The woman beside me leaned over, her face lighting up with genuine warmth. Middle-aged, kind eyes, probably heading to LA to visit family. “Are you excited about this trip?”

My smile widened, all teeth and practiced perfection. Sixteen years of wearing masks had taught me exactly how to look harmless. “Yeah, I’m starting a new life.”

If only you knew, I thought, maintaining that sweet expression while my mind supplied the rest: that this sweet smile belongs to the top-ranked assassin on the global hit list. That I could kill you seventeen different ways with the plastic coffee stirrer in your cup holder. That starting a new life meant betraying the most dangerous organization on the planet.

“How wonderful!” She squeezed my arm. “New beginnings are such a gift.”

“Absolutely,” I agreed, settling back into my seat.

The truth was simpler than anyone would believe. I wasn’t leaving because killing had lost its appeal. I wasn’t suffering from some sudden attack of conscience or moral awakening. No—killing had become too easy. Point, shoot, collect payment. Rinse and repeat until even the most elaborate contracts felt like checking items off a grocery list.

But adapting to normal society? Now that was a challenge worth taking. Learning to smile without calculating threat levels. Making small talk without profiling everyone in the room. Buying groceries, paying taxes, pretending to care about traffic jams—that was the real test of skill.

Plus, there was the minor detail of Bloodline definitely sending people to kill me for deserting. The thought sent a pleasant thrill down my spine. Finally, some excitement. Life was about to get interesting again.

The seatbelt sign dinked off. Around me, passengers relaxed into their seats, pulling out tablets and magazines. The woman beside me closed her eyes for a nap. I reached into my bag, fingers closing around the book I’d bought specifically for this trip.

*“How to Integrate into Society: A Practical Guide.”*

I was three pages in, genuinely fascinated by a chapter on appropriate conversation topics for workplace water coolers, when the first scream shattered the cabin’s peace.

You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.

Six men burst from the bathroom area and front cabin, tactical vests strapped tight, weapons raised. Not just any weapons—MP5 submachine guns, if I wasn’t mistaken. Professional grade. The leader, a man with a scar bisecting his left eyebrow, fired a warning shot into the ceiling that had everyone screaming and diving for cover.

I couldn’t believe my luck. I was trying to leave this life behind, and here it was, following me onto a commercial flight.

“Nobody move!” Scar-face bellowed, his voice carrying over the chaos. “Everyone stays calm, nobody dies today. Maybe.”

I turned the page of my book. Chapter three: maintaining appropriate personal boundaries in social situations.

The woman beside me grabbed my sleeve, her face pale with terror. “Little sister, get down! Hide behind the seat!”

Little sister? Don’t let this innocent face fool you, lady. But I kept that thought to myself and continued reading. The chapter was actually quite informative.

“Did you hear me?” She yanked harder on my arm, genuine panic in her voice. “Please, you have to hide!”

I appreciated the concern, truly. But after sixteen years of professional killing, hijacking scenarios ranked somewhere between mildly interesting and Tuesday afternoon on my concern scale. A few armed men shouting threats? That barely qualified as an inconvenience.

The crack of a gunshot made the woman beside me sob. A passenger three rows up slumped forward, blood spreading across his business shirt. The cabin erupted into fresh screams.

“Listen up!” Scar-face stalked down the aisle, his boots heavy against the cabin floor. “I know we have a Bloodline operative on this plane. Phantom, to be specific.” He said my name like it was poison. “You stole something that belongs to us. The Satan’s Heart. So why don’t you make this easy and show yourself?”

Silence descended, broken only by muffled crying and the steady hum of the engines.

I flipped another page. This section on gift-giving etiquette was surprisingly complex.

Scar-face and his men began moving through the cabin, checking faces, pulling people up from their seats. They focused on the men—broad shoulders, military bearing, anyone who looked remotely capable of violence. Every few rows, another confrontation. Another gunshot. Another body.

Blood spattered across the overhead compartments. The cabin reeked of gunpowder and fear.

The woman beside me had her eyes squeezed shut, lips moving in silent prayer.

“Interesting,” I murmured, still absorbed in my book. “Apparently you’re supposed to write thank-you notes within two weeks. Who knew social norms were so specific?”",1,1771017034.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

1r419fk,https://i.redd.it/e6k188wmubjg1.jpeg,art by JupiterrWuz,"The heavy oak doors of the Hazbin Hotel creaked open, admitting a gust of sulfuric wind and the Radio Demon himself. Alastor stepped into the lobby, his usual pinstriped coat tucked firmly under one arm. Though his trademark grin was stitched across his face—a permanent, yellowed crescent—his eyes told a different story. The radio dials in his irises spun sluggishly, dim and exhausted, lacking their usual maniacal glow.

He didn't walk so much as drift, his posture uncharacteristically slumped. Sensing its master’s fatigue, Alastor’s shadow detached itself from the floorboards, stretching out with spindly, elongated limbs to shove the velvet sofa a few inches closer.

Alastor collapsed into it with a melodramatic huff, throwing a clawed hand over his face to shield his eyes from the warm, golden glow of the lobby chandeliers. The faint hum of static surrounding him sounded less like a broadcast and more like a dying signal.

""What a positively *dreadful* day,"" he whispered to the empty air, his voice lacking its usual amplified reverb.

""You want a drink?""

The gruff, gravelly voice cut through Alastor’s self-pity. Behind the bar, Husk was already pouring a generous measure of cheap whiskey into a tumbler. The winged cat demon smirked, his tail flicking lazily behind him as he capped the bottle.

Alastor lowered his hand, his neck cracking audibly as he turned to glare at the bartender. He opened his mouth, a sharp, witty retort poised on his tongue, but the energy simply wasn't there. Instead, he let out a distorted sigh of static and offered a stiff, singular nod.

Husk grabbed the bottle and two glasses, walking around the bar with a heavy, tired gait. He sat across from the Overlord, sliding a glass across the low coffee table.

""You look like shit,"" Husk stated flatly, taking a swig of his own booze.

Alastor bristled, his smile tightening at the edges. ""Just because I no longer hold the leash to your soul, Husker, does not mean I cannot still flay the fur from your hide.""

""I’m trembling,"" Husk deadpanned, not looking the least bit impressed. He swirled the amber liquid in his glass. ""So, what’s the matter, Smiles? You look like you went twelve rounds with an exorcist.""

""As if I would burden myself by explaining my tribulations to *you*,"" Alastor scoffed, picking up his glass with an extended pinky.

""Sure, Red. Keep it bottled up. Worked great for you so far,"" Husk grunted. ""Now speak.""

Alastor groaned, a sound like a record scratching. He took a long sip of whiskey before slamming the glass down. ""Ugh! I ventured into the city to procure a token of affection for Emily. It is Valentine’s Day, after all, and... well, I need her to suspect nothing! It is all part of my grand design to eventually siphon her celestial power!""

He declared this with a sudden, manic flare of jazz hands, but seeing Husk’s unimpressed eyebrow raise, Alastor deflated back into the cushions.

""And?"" Husk prompted.

""And... I found myself ensnared in all manner of pedestrian foolishness!"" Alastor pinched the bridge of his nose. ""First, Charlie required assistance preparing a gift for her beloved Vaggie. It was a stupid, sentimental gesture, naturally, but she kept making the most *amateur* mistakes! So, naturally, I followed her. Strictly to revel in her inevitable failure and agony, you understand.""

""Right. You followed her to watch her fail,"" Husk said dryly. ""Which is why you ended up helping her pick the perfect present?""

Alastor narrowed his eyes, his radio feedback screeching softly. ""But that wasn't all! Then I had the misfortune of bumping into Niffty. While I had absolutely no time to waste, she was frantic, demanding I use my influence to secure a reservation for her meeting with that fish-man, Baxter.""

Alastor shuddered, smoothing his lapels. ""Now, I loathe every syllable of that sentence, but Baxter is... an interesting fellow. He did mute and humiliate Vox, so I suppose the little insect deserves some credit.""

""So, you wanted Niffty to have a good time,"" Husk summarized, leaning back.

""No!"" Alastor snapped, his antlers growing slightly in irritation.

""Okay. Keep lying to yourself.""

""Finally,"" Alastor continued, his voice rising with theatrical frustration, ""I finally had a moment to scour the markets, only to encounter a weeping sinner desperate to find the 'love of his life' who had perished years prior. He had taken his own life simply to find her. I was *delighted* to assist him, purely in the hopes that their reunion would lead to some entertaining catharsis—screaming, rejection, the works!""

Alastor threw his hands up. ""Imagine my utter disappointment when she actually *loved* him! They reunited right there in the street. Disgusting. Nauseating!""

Husk chuckled, a low, rasping sound. ""Sounds to me like you did a hell of a lot of good deeds today, Al.""

The air pressure in the room dropped. Alastor’s eyes turned into radio dials, glowing ominous red. ""Don’t you *dare*, Husker. I will tear your soul apart for sport.""

""You could, Red,"" Husk said, unbothered, finishing his drink. ""But maybe you should think about it differently. You want to give Emily a present? She’s a Seraph. She feeds on good vibes and redemption crap. Telling her you spent your day helping people?"" Husk stood up, dusting off his suspenders. ""That might just be the perfect gift for our little angel.""

Alastor blinked, the menacing red glow fading back to his usual look of mild annoyance. He stared into his empty glass, processing the logic.

""Didn’t you hear anything I said?"" Alastor muttered, though the venom was gone. ""Or is your feeble mind incapable of understanding anything beyond the bottom of a bottle? I have *no* physical gift for her!""

""You gave your time. That counts,"" Husk said, patting Alastor awkwardly on the shoulder before turning to leave.

Alastor, clearly thrown off his game by the logic, straightened his coat, trying to regain his composure by insulting the insufferable cat. ""And where exactly are *you* going, dressed so shabbily?""

""I have dinner with Angel,"" Husk said, not turning back as he headed for the door.

""Ha!"" Alastor’s grin widened, looking for a weak spot. ""I knew it! You’ve finally become the domesticated pussycat that spider thinks you are.""

""Weak comeback, Alastor. That girl really did make you softer.""

Husk paused at the door, his hand on the handle. He finally turned back, looking Alastor dead in the eye with a rare, sincere expression.

""I’m proud of you, Boss.""

1r4149r,https://i.redd.it/iiapacwttbjg1.png,Tested something weird with AI search and it actually worked for getting seller leads in Fresno (no Zillow ads involved),"&#x200B;

Okay so this is going to sound like some SEO guru nonsense but hear me out because the results were honestly surprising.

\*\*Background:\*\* I'm sick of paying $400-700 per lead on Zillow/Realtor and getting tire-kickers who are ""just looking"" or ghost after one showing. Been doing this in Fresno for 6 years and the lead quality has tanked.

\*\*The insight:\*\* I started tracking what questions actual sellers ask me in consultations. The #1 thing literally every seller asks in the first 5 minutes:

\*\*""How long will it actually take to sell my house right now?""\*\*

Everyone's situation is different (divorce, job relocation, inherited property, whatever) but they ALL want to know the timeline. Makes sense—they're trying to plan their life.

\*\*Here's where it got interesting:\*\*

I asked ChatGPT, Google Assistant, and Perplexity this exact question: ""How long does it take to sell a house in Fresno?""

\- ChatGPT gave me some generic 2023 article about national averages (useless)

\- Google gave me a Zillow blog post from 2022 

\- Perplexity pulled from... basically nothing Fresno-specific

So I did an experiment:

\*\*What I did:\*\*1. Created a simple blog post on my site with the EXACT question as the title: ""How Long Does It Take to Sell a House in Fresno in 2026?

2. Wrote the answer like I was texting a friend

   \- Direct answer first: ""28-35 days average right now based on MLS data""

   \- Broke it down by neighborhood (Tower: 21-28 days, Fig Garden: 35-42, etc.)

   \- Added the ""but here's what actually affects your timeline"" sectio

3. Added some nerdy technical stuff:

   \- FAQ schema (so Google can pull it into answer boxes)

   \- Used ""Fresno"" + neighborhood names like 10 times naturally

   \- Recorded a 60-sec video saying the same thing

   \- Posted it to my Google Business Profile

\*\*Results after 45 days:\*\*

\- 17 seller consultation requests (vs my normal 3-4/month from all sources)

\- 12 specifically mentioned finding my ""timeline info"" when they called

\- 4 said they asked their Alexa/Google and ""found your .

\- Closed 2 listings so far, 3 more in pipeline

\*\*The actual actionable thing:\*\*

Go to AnswerThePublic or just think about the #1 question your sellers ALWAYS ask. Create content that:

\- Uses their exact question as your title

\- Gives a straight answer in the first 2 sentences 

\- Gets weirdly specific about YOUR city/neighborhoods

\- Talks like a human, not a corporate blog

The AI search engines are desperate for LOCAL answers. They've got national data but they don't have ""Fig Garden vs Tower District timelines in February 2026.""

\*\*The seller pain point this solves:\*\*

Every seller is trying to plan their life around the sale. They need to coordinate:

\- Job start dates

\- School enrollment for kids

\- Apartment leases ending

\- Purchase closing on new house

\- Moving company schedules

When they can't get a real answer to ""how long will this take,"" they spiral into decision paralysis and don't list at all—or they list with whoever gives them the most optimistic BS timeline.

\*\*Why this actually works:\*\*

People are asking their AI assistants questions at 10 PM on a Wednesday. If YOU'RE the local expert who answered that question with real Fresno data, guess who they're calling on Thursday morning?

Not revolutionary, but it's way better ROI than Zillow ads and the leads actually close.

\*\*TL;DR:\*\* Answer the exact questions your sellers are asking AI assistants, get specific about Fresno neighborhoods, stop writing like a corporate blog. AI search will serve your content to people actively looking to sell.

Happy to answer questions if anyone wants to try this. Not trying to sell anything, just sharing what worked.

\*\*MEME IMAGE PROMPT:\*\*

Create a Reddit-style meme (self-aware, slightly cynical humor):

\*\*FORMAT:\*\* Three-panel vertical meme (classic Reddit style)

\*\*PANEL 1 (TOP):\*\*

\- Screenshot aesthetic of ChatGPT interface

\- User question: ""how long to sell house in fresno""

\- ChatGPT response showing: ""According to national averages from 2023...""

\- Caption overlay: ""AI in 2025: idk bro here's some old national data""

\*\*PANEL 2 (MIDDLE):\*\*

\- Frustrated seller sitting at laptop at night (dim lighting, coffee cup)

\- Multiple browser tabs open: Zillow, Redfin, ChatGPT, Google

\- All showing different, conflicting info

\- Facepalm or head-in-hands pose

\- Caption: ""Sellers googling at 11 PM trying to plan their life""

\*\*PANEL 3 (BOTTOM):\*\*

\- Same seller, now on phone, looking relieved

\- Phone screen shows clean, simple answer: ""Fresno homes: 28-35 days (Fig Garden: 35-42, Tower: 21-28)""

\- Small ""Local Agent"" badge visible on screen

\- Caption: ""AI finally finds actual Fresno data and drops your name""

\- Bottom text: ""tfw AI does your cold calling for you""

\*\*STYLE:\*\*

\- Authentic meme aesthetic (not corporate/polished)

\- Use actual screenshot styling for panel 1

\- Relatable stock photo or illustrated character

\- Drake meme or expanding brain meme energy

\- Comic Sans or Impact font for captions (classic meme style)

\- 800x1200 vertical or 1080x1080 square

\- Slightly grainy/compressed look (authentic Reddit meme feel)

\- Maybe add Pepe or wojak elements if feeling spicy

\*\*Text at bottom:\*\*

""stop paying zillow $600/lead challenge (impossible) 💀""

\*\*Alternative footer:\*\*

""local SEO goes brrrr 📈""

\---

\*\*POSTING NOTES:\*\*

\- Post to r/fresno with flair ""Discussion"" or ""Local Business""

\- Post to r/realtors with flair ""Marketing"" or ""Lead Generation""  

\- Best posting time: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM PST (when Reddit engagement peaks)

\- Engage with every comment for first 2-3 hours

\- Don't mention fresnowebmasters in the post itself—let it come up naturally if people ask ""who did you use for this?"" in comments

\- Expect some skepticism—respond with more data/specifics

\- If someone calls BS, share actual Google Analytics screenshot (redact sensitive info)",1,1771016680.0,aioptimizedwebdesign,3,1.0,False

What is hygge (pronounced “hoo-gah”)? It’s a Danish concept and feeling of cozy contentment, well-being, and enjoying life's simple pleasures. It involves slowing down, spending time with others, and appreciating the simple things in life like candlelight, warm drinks, good food, & meaningful conversations. Hygge can be a state of mind, an atmosphere, or an activity.

At our Hygge Hangout, we will be offering a special ""candlelit"" Family Yoga at 10 am in the Gallery. This class is open to all ages, abilities, and skill levels. You can bring your own yoga mat or borrow one from the library. Advanced registration is recommended, but not required.

We will also have Sunspire Cafe, the mobile espresso bar, offering complimentary coffee and tea drinks (hot or cold!) in the Lobby along with cozy themed coloring pages for all ages, word searches, puzzles, and crafts.

My day has never gone so well. When it does go well I expect something bad to ruin it.

And for once nothing bad happened. 

I saw some friends I haven't been able to see in a while yesterday. 

We sat in a coffee shop and bitched for a while. It felt amazing. 

And then I cooked a dinner I was very proud of. It was healthy too which is a plus. 

And then today I had a nice chat with a taxi driver. He drove me all the way home when he didn't have to and it was so out of his way. 

He made me think of a sweet grandpa. 

My brain is still waiting for something bad to happen and I hate the feeling. 

So yeah it looks like 13's my lucky number.

I’ve been watching some people’s modifications for inspiration and don’t feel I have the creativity for it 😆 some points below what I struggled on. 

1. The wire chairs was really challenging, didn’t help that I didn’t notice the difference between the small eyelets and big eyelets. I squeezed them into the small ones 😆 and found the big ones hidden in the box later on. 

2. The walls have white card on as I painted the wall 3 times with the paint required and it didn’t look covered at all. I’ve missed a strip that’ll I sort when I go back to it. 

3. Some windows/ doors I was so confused about which way to glue as it wasn’t obvious on the instructions and I did glue it the wrong way originally 😅 

4. I added the est 2026 as I’m going to add a sign with my name on instead, just printed the wrong size and not back to work until Monday to print again 🤣

5. Also the wiring for the lighting heat shrink wrap was new which was exciting! 

6. The door mat ended up being a blanket for the suitcase as I had already glued the door on the paper. 

All in all, I really enjoyed it, it took me much longer than I anticipated! I hope to join an event at some point but for now I’m being inspired by everyone’s cool builds! 😁 I love this hobby. ",13,1771016650.0,booknooks,4,1.0,False

While searching for a deal on a Vertuo Pop+, I ran across an ""As-Is"" Vertuo Pop+ Deluxe (basically a slightly more expensive Pop+ with some of the trim being metal instead of plastic and a larger water reservoir) at the HSN (Home Shopping Network) Website.

While the fact that it is as-is probably eliminates the warranty beyond 30 days to return it to HSN if there are problems, this comes with both a 12 pod sample pack AND a promo coupon that allows you to get 5 free sleeves (either the coffee discovery pack or the coffee & espresso variety pack).  No shipping costs or need to buy anything else.

That's 62 pods plus the machine for $62.99 + $7.50 shipping + tax.  On top of that, if you havent shopped at HSN before, at least right now, you can use the WELCOME2026 promo to get $15 off that price.

For you real deal hunters, you can use Capital One Shopping or Rakuten to further get cash back.

For me personally, I ended up paying $58.82 total at HSN, got $7.38 back from Capital One Shopping, and have a subscription service that refunded me the $7.50 in shipping.  My total cost:  $43.94.

Even without cash back or refunds, $58.82 is still cheaper than just buying the pods. 

And yes, I did go through the nespresso promo site's registration process to register my machine and selected my 5 sleeve variety pack and the pods are on the way, so it doesn't seem to matter that the machine isn't new.",5,1771016536.0,nespresso,3,0.86,False

1r4116y,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1r4116y/setup_recommendation_beginner2000/,Setup recommendation beginner[2000€],"I’m looking for advice in regards to a setup that a total beginner could use, just implying that the learning curve isn’t too steep.

I been on the edge of starting my espresso making journey, just out of genuine interest for a while, but after returning from Rome a weeks ago I have hit my tipping point. I was firstly looking into the bialetti pots, but after falling into the rabbithole that is this subreddit, I have upped my budget quite substantially. I live in Europe, and would like find a full setup for around 2000€, cheaper is better, as I haven’t told my wife about my plans yet.. :-)

I have been looking at the Lelit Elizabeth, Mara X, and was previously recommended the Rocket, main reason for picking the Lelits is that they seem to be quite popular on here, and then a good grinder to pair, notably recommended a DF64 by a friend of mine, but I’m not really sure if it’s good not, I have understood by now, that a grinder isn’t really something I shouldn’t skimp out on.

I’m a total beginner in the espresso world, as I have never made one before. I do however enjoy spending a lot of the time in the kitchen in general, so perfecting my coffee seems right up my alley.

That being said, I was once considering maybe getting a really nice grinder, and a espressomachine that was really easy to use for first, then upgrading the machine when I feel like it in the future. Would love to see some of your setups aswell. Hit me!",1,1771016477.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1r410wn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BadNeighbors/comments/1r410wn/nightmare_neighbor_is_master_at_reactive_abuse/,Nightmare Neighbor is Master at Reactive Abuse Manipulation,"I have an interesting story to tell about a workshop I built on my property.  It won't sound true, but I assure you it is 100% true and I am living it right now with no help from local sources, such as County Board of Trustees or the local County Assessor, and lawyers won't touch the matter with a ten-foot pole.  They won't even talk to me, they just ignore my calls and always say, ""We'll call you back.""  Right.

I'm going to keep the details simple, but please know this started in March of 2025, and is still happening now.  As you read this you may wonder if this is a small, backwoods town.  The answer is yes, and no.  It is not a simple backwoods town, it has populations and some modernity, but racism, bigotry, apathy and xenophobia transcend time and space.

Here it goes,

I bought a house about three years before this event, and the property line between my neighbor's house and mine was pretty obvious from lawn mowing patterns and Google Earth imagery.  There were only brief drawings for the septic systems in the deed, no real mention of property boundaries.  Soon after I had moved in, the neighbor had approached me and introduced himself as the homeowner next door and told me where he believed our property lines existed and used some landscaping brick walls as a reference to where the boundary was.  He said he'd built the brick walls (which ran perpendicular to the boundary line) years before and had gotten out of hand during the building and had built them several feet into my property.  He'd said he could remove the walls as they were just the landscaping blocks you buy at the hardware store to make pottery walls, but I said it didn't bother me, especially since they were an existing landscaping element of his before I bought the house.

Around March of 2025, I decided to build a workshop between my neighbor's property and mine next to an existing shed that was on my property when I bought it.  There had been a tree in this spot, which I had removed two years prior, and it seemed like a good spot to have a workshop next to my tool shed.  I had used Google Earth data and a local property line resource that shows basic overlays of land lines between houses and deeded properties and what the neighbor had said about where the line was.  I was also going to do it in the footprint of where the tree had been.  No sooner had I broken ground on the project, the neighbor had come out and offered to help.  He'd been friendly to me since the day I moved in, and never did I expect what was to come when this workshop was finished.

Over the course of the next three months, the neighbor checked in on my project many times, always being friendly, offering to help and even giving me advice on the roof and floor.  He even lent me a tool to help me pack the ground while building the foundation, which was posts cemented into the ground three feet deep, with the floor floating above the ground about 18"".  

About two months after the workshop was built, while I was building the furniture for the shop, the neighbor came to me and told me another neighbor was telling him to do a survey.  When I asked him what good would a survey do now, two months AFTER the shop was finished, he responded with a smile, ""Then it's going to be my shed.""  He then walked away back up to his house, which is about 200 feet up a hill behind the structure.  Did he really see a future where he could take possession of the workshop legally?

I did not see the neighbor for a few weeks, but I stopped working on the shop's furniture as the stress of the situation began to take its toll.  When the neighbor did come around again, he said he said he still wanted to do a survey and they were about $800.  When I again asked him, what purpose would a survey serve now when the shop was already finished, he said he had a right to do a survey and it had nothing to do with the shop.  I again asked him why this was important now and that it was giving me a lot of stress.  He laughed and said, ""Don't lose any sleep over it, I am talking to some people.  But I may choose to be a dick about this.""  I didn't know what that meant, but it alarmed me that he was now part of a bigger scheme than just him and the one neighbor who had told him to do a survey weeks before.  Little did I know, at this point, everyone was involved, as you will read soon.

A few weeks later, around early July, the neighbor came to my front door.  When I opened the door, there were three people standing on my lawn with survey equipment.  I asked the neighbor what was going on, and he said those were the surveyors and they were surveying all the houses in the neighborhood to get an accurate land measurement.  I asked him if that was normal, and he said, yes, and I should stay out of their way to avoid the legal matters which come with interfering with surveyors.  I asked him how much it was costing and he said $1600.  I said that was twice the price he had told me, and he said he didn't mind because it was important to him.  

None of this seemed right, so I called the law firm who wrote my deed and they said it was legal for a surveyor to do this in the State.  When I told the lawyer the entirety of the situation, he said he would call the neighbor's lawyer because he ""knew them.""  I had no idea just what this meant, but I would soon come to my suspicions that the neighbor's lawyers had already contacted the law firm who wrote my deed and they were in on the whole matter.  Before I was even seeking legal counsel, which they denied and refused after six calls and a physical consultation.  They flat out refused to be involved; they never even billed me for the consultations or the many phone calls.

After the survey, which was clearly about the shop, I found markings in front and behind the structure, placing the structure three feet into the neighbor's land.  As stated before, this is about 200 feet behind the neighbor's house, in an empty lot he bought when he bought his house over 20 years ago; it's not right next to his house or in front of his kitchen.  It's just in an empty field, so you don't think three feet is a LOT and is spilling over into his front porch.  These are half acre lots, not 1000 square foot lots where a neighbor's burp floods your nostrils.

The next day, the neighbor approached me in the backyard and said he was happy the survey proved the encroachment and he wanted to talk to a lawyer about his legal options.  I told him that in the course of the past three months since he had mentioned the survey, I had been doing a lot of research and the State law is clear that encroachments like this, usually a fence or a shed (like what I built) the neighbors are expected to work it out and rarely did the State allow for a civil lawsuit.  I offered cash for the damages.  He said he still wanted to know his options.  When he came back a few days later, he looked distraught, and angrily stated his lawyer told him to accept an easement because he was present during the building of the shop and we both made a mistake with not knowing where the border was.  I reminded him I would give him money for the damages, but he angrily stated he didn't want any money because we both messed up.  He was going to accept the easement cash-free.

A few days later, the neighbor returned to my front door, much happier this time.  He stated he had been talking to ""some more people"" and they were telling him that he should ""allow me to have the shed as long as I lived in the house, but if I wanted to sell the house the shed had to come down.""  When I asked him how that made any sense, his shoulders slumped and he said, ""What would you do?""  I reminded him that ever since I had moved in we both thought his landscaping walls were a few feet into my land and I never cared and that information was what I had used for where I built my shop.  He then shrugged and said, ""Well, that's just my pottery, and you build a WHOLE shed!""  I asked him how they were different, and his face instantly turned red, he clenched his fists and screamed ""YOUR SHED IS COMING DOWN!""  I backed away from his attack and said, ""Fuck you.""  He then smiled the broadest, wickedest smile I had ever seen on his face.  That was when I went into my garage, mumbling a whole ton of profanity.  He walked away, still smiling.

Over the course of the next few weeks, the neighbor started sending me letters in the US mail.  Each confused the situation more, with him making statements that made little sense like, ""I tried to work this out with you, but you didn't want to make it work.""  Never any apologies or explanation to his behavior screaming at me, nor did his letters ever tell me what he wanted me to do.  It was like he was baiting me to go to his house so he could start another argument, maybe a fight.  There was no way I was falling for that trick.  In fact, over the course of the past five months up to this point, all of our interactions had been him coming to my property, never me going to his, which is about 250 feet from my back door to his front door.  The only time I had ever been to his house at all in the past 3 years was when I was building the roof of the shop and he had come around to pester me some more, then offered to show me the roof to a shed he had just built the year before.  I had gone with him, and he showed me his own shed.  That was it.  But I was not going to fall for his trick of getting me to be the one to go to his house for his next attack.  The final letter he sent me said he wanted the shed destroyed by April.  

A few weeks after that I received a letter from his lawyer, sating I created this problem and every time the neighbor tried to work it out with me nicely and neighborly, I screamed at him with profanity and insults.  The lawyer then said his client was amassing massive debt with this situation because I forced him to retain a lawyer, and if I didn't remove the shed by April, I was going to get sued.  It was a standard format intimidation letter, not particularly well-written, but more of a warning that he was willing to lie and reverse timelines and events in any way that benefitted his client.  It also warned me he was the type of lawyer who tacks on massive fees to maximize the costs for the client.  I wrote the lawyer an email, telling him this story you have just read, but with a far more detailed timeline of the three months it took me to build the shop and the many interactions with the neighbor the entire time, never with him challenging the building of the structure until two whole months after it was finished.  The lawyer ignored me, so I wrote a letter to the neighbor and told him I would remove the shed, so he didn't need to spend money on a lawyer.  Within 48 hours, the shed was destroyed and is now a pile of smashed and twisted metal on my front lawn.

Now, in case you are wondering, why did I give in so easy?  Why didn't I just go to court, let the court decide if the neighbor was right or if the court had some other remedy, one that would not result in 2 tons of steel and wood and concrete now sitting somewhere, causing an environmental issue?  Good questions, because I studied case histories like this, and NEVER do courts choose in favor of the destruction of a structure in a situation like this where the neighbor watched me built it and waited two months until it was finished to suddenly want it destroyed.  Here's the information I left out:

While this was going on in the background noise of life, I contacted many lawyers, and even a local Mediator, who runs a law firm specializing in dispute mediation, where the two neighbors are too stupid to work things out like gentlemen.  No lawyer would talk to me, not even for a second.  Oh, I got many consultations, but they always wanted to know who was involved so they could contact them, after which that lawyer never spoke to me again.  And the Mediator, she straight up told me she could not get involved and I had to find a Mediator who worked and lived outside the area who didn't ""know those guys.""  Yeah, she basically admitted she knew these people, and could not get involved, not even as a mediator.  I wrote to her again, but she did like everyone else around here and never responded again.  Radio silence.  Complete Cancel Culture anthropomorphized.  

And remember the survey that started all of this?  The one where the neighbor woke me up at my door with the surveyors standing on my front lawn doing the survey?  The survey the neighbor said was $800 and then all of a sudden was $1600?  Right.  He paid for my land to be surveyed as well as his (ILLEGAL!).  Why did he have to pay for two surveys?  The surveyor moved the neighbor's lot three feet into mine to put the shed on his property, and he needed to move my land three feet into the other neighbor's property on the other side of my house.  WOW!  So, I filed a complaint with the State Surveyor's Office.  Radio silence.  I guess they also ""know those guys.""  I also wrote a complaint to the State Bar about the lawyer who wrote my deed, the one who said he would call the neighbor's lawyers but never spoke to me again after they did.  Radio silence.  The lawyers who wrote my deed did tell me surveyors could made a three-foot error because surveyors can do that.  They can move borders as they need to.  I guess for ""those guys,"" when deemed appropriate for the ""brotherhood"" land lines can be shifted.  

Furthermore, this county has what is called a Board of Trustees that handles unincorporated towns like where I live.  People who collect tax dollars year 'round to sit and drink coffee then step in between neighbors when disputes like this arise.  I wrote to them.  I even spoke with their clerk, who told me the board would decide what to do and either order me to destroy the shed or the neighbor to accept the easement.  You know what they did?  Radio silence.  I guess they, too, ""know those guys.""  You know, if I had been deemed wrong, they would have told me in two seconds flat to remove the shed.  They would have even sent the Sheriff to Tase me and bash me on the head with a nightstick for building the stupid ""workshop.""  But they did no such thing.  They just ignored me and my ""problem"" with ""those guys.""  I guess they really do ""know those guys.""  They know them well enough and just ignore me until I went away, because in this town ignoring a problem just makes it evaporate.  Right.

I know, you're again thinking this is some backwoods, primitive community stuck in the 1700's.  It's really not.  It's got high speed internet, paved roads, highways, and a stop light, maybe two.  It's a real, modern town.  But... apathy, racism, and bigotry transcend morality every time.  Nothing like xenophobia to erase common sense and years of civilized human progress.

I'm interested in what people think about this mess.  Was I wrong to make this workshop?  It's not like I parked a rusty old RV in front of my neighbor's kitchen while he was away on vacation.  It took me three months to build this workshop, and he was there from day one, and I was using information he himself gave me about where the boundary was.  I never lived anywhere that a neighborhood didn't like it when a neighbor adds value to their home.  Every time a home goes up in value the homes around it go up as well.  I can't imagine my home having gone up in value now with a 2-thousand-pound pile of twisted steel and crushed wood in front of it, but maybe I am wrong.  Maybe I am missing something.",4,1771016460.0,BadNeighbors,0,1.0,False

1r40zm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1r40zm0/how_do_you_actually_leave/,how do you actually leave?,"hello, sorry this is long. i (22f) and my girlfriend (23f — i’ll call her May) started dating a few weeks ago, but we’ve been best friends since we were 16. we’re very similar but process life really differently, which has always caused tension.

i’ve liked her since i was 18, but timing never worked. we got especially close in college. very emotionally intense, kinda homoerotic best-friend energy. we even signed a lease to live together junior year.

then right after sophomore year, when i was only 20, i got diagnosed with a rare progressive neurological condition. it was terrifying. there’s only one treatment and it could paralyze me. i had to wait 3 months to find out if i’d need it. i was alone all summer, my parents were in a messy divorce, and i’d just had a huge falling out with my mom.

and May basically disappeared.

she barely texted, called once maybe. i’d double and triple text just to get short replies. by july i stopped reaching out to see if she would. she didn’t respond for a month.

then we still had to live together that fall.

i didn't text her at all the rest of the summer, and only texted her one week prior to moving in to tell her what day i was coming. she asked to call the night before she moved in. we did. i told her i was deeply hurt at her choice to abandon me during the darkest time of my life. she gave me a heartless flat apology and was basically like ""there's no excuse"".

after hearing that, i decided to not bring it up with her again because i couldn't sit through another conversation like that. not while i was fighting for my life while my body was deteriorating. i ended up having to withdraw from fall quarter and quit my job. we stayed friends and fell into old habits because despite my pain and anguish, i missed her so deeply and i desperately needed someone.

we were close all year, but i was obviously deeply hurt and deeply upset and keeping her at arms length. i went back to school winter quarter and was just trying to survive between appts and all the agonizing pain. come june i told her i don't want to be roommates again because i am still hurt by the previous summer. she didn't respond well. she told me that i had a phone too and that i should have reached out if i wanted support. she said that she felt like our whole friendship was a lie and that she was deeply hurt by me waiting a whole year to tell her this. i told her that was bs and that i don't want to be friends anymore. this caused her to spiral and panic and plead with me to reconsider. i didn't. i stood my ground.

we lived together for 2 more months till the lease was up. we were cordial and friendly. honestly just behaving the same with more distance. i felt horribly guilty because i thought i was unfair in cutting her off (i now know thats not true and that i was justified).

all our friend groups over lap (both ones from home and college) so we still saw each other occasionally and would catch up and talk and it would feel so natural.

in February, the asked if we could catch up and get coffee. i said yes, and we hung out for 4 hours and it felt so nice to be with her. i apologized for not giving our friendship a chance (i now hate that i said this because i absolutely did give it a chance. but i had just spent the last 4 months yearning and suffering over not being around her). we waited to start having repair talks for a few months due to life circumstances. and when we did start them, all the pain flooded back into me. at first it was me apologizing, but she kept trying to gaslight me by saying she did not step out of my life that summer, that she didn't abandon me, that she really did try to support me because she googled my diagnosis and talked with our mutual bestie about it.... and then she kept saying that it was a hard summer for her too because she was so depressed and just laid in bed high with her cats all day. i sat through so many of these conversations and finally in may i told her ""if you do not take accountability for what you did to me we cannot be friends"" and then she finally said ""i now see how i wasn't there for you"". this rocked me because i realized it had taken her two years to say that to me. so i pulled back and we had a lot of distance.

over the summer on her europe grad trip, she broke her wrist and had to have surgery and the friend she went with did not step up properly to help her and this really gave May new perspective. she really changed after that injury.

all of our talks became far more productive after this and she took very real very honest accountability about how she failed to be my friend that summer.  how inappropriate it was for her to gaslight me through all our convos. how she never grasped how serious my condition was.

i always knew she never behaved out of malice towards me, that was never in question. i knew she was just inconsiderate and self-centered. the lack of malice made me believe this was something salvageable. that because we both love each other so deeply, it would be worth it. no one sees me how she does (no one also misunderstands me more). no one knows me more than her. i know i haven't focused much on the good between us in this post but trust it was there. through all of this, i still had feelings for her (despite not wanting to)

and come this october, i realized, that she had feelings for me too. we beat around the bush for a few months, and then finally a few weeks ago she asked me out. and now were dating.

i have been very open and honest with her about my fears, about how i worry that i'll never get over what she did, that she will leave me again when i get sick. that maybe love isn't enough. but she feels secure. and she feels that we are worth the risk.

i thought i felt that way too. but my mental health has tanked since we started dating. i have OCD and i haven't stopped ruminating on her for 2.5 years. and i am so tired of dissecting our relationship trying to make it palatable. but i think i am realizing some ruptures are just too big, that even if they change (which she has) the original wound cannot be healed whilst we are together.

I should also mention, she just moved into the apt unit above me... to add insult to injury.

i love her. so much. i thought i was in love with her. but maybe i am not. i just can't seem to let her go, despite knowing how unhealthy this is. despite knowing i deserve more. i never considered myself to be a doormat, believe it or not but i do stand up for myself, but just not with her for some reason. i am terrified at what my life would look like without her in it, but i am so tired of being consumed by our history. it literally haunts me all day and all night.

how do you actually take that step to leave? especially when proximity and mutual friends are in the mix. i feel terrible leaving only a few weeks into us dating, but i don't want to lead her on.",2,1771016382.0,LesbianActually,2,0.75,False

1r40y5p,https://i.redd.it/y0kcltdosbjg1.jpeg,Eyes in the Snow [Entry I],"**Arctic Research Station E-7**

*March 2nd*

The Arctic is nothing like the textbooks describe. Those diagrams, the sweeping panoramas printed in National Geographic, the photos of pale, rolling hills of snow, all of them lie. The wind here is alive. It bites at every layer of clothing, crawling beneath gloves, burrowing into boots. It cracks against the metal siding of the station like some ancient percussion instrument, and it never stops. Not for a second. Not for a blink.

We arrived late yesterday, sleds dragged behind the cargo plane, their runners scraping against the frozen tundra. Snow drifted across the landing field in rippling waves, some larger than a compact car. The temperature read minus twenty-four Celsius, but with the wind chill, it might as well have been minus fifty. The station itself is a skeleton of aluminum and reinforced glass, built to withstand storms like this, though even from inside, the metal groans under the persistent pressure of ice and wind.

Dr. Everwood, our team leader, claims he’s seen conditions like this before, in northern Greenland, decades ago, but his bravado does little to warm the air or our spirits. He’s methodical, precise, always the first to unload equipment and check instruments. Carter, our climatologist, follows closely behind, noting wind direction and subtle shifts in the snowpack. The others, a handful of grad students and research assistants, fall somewhere in between fascination and exhaustion. Their faces are pale behind balaclavas, eyes wide with the Arctic’s deceptive beauty and latent menace.

I spend most of my attention on the herd. There are elk here, or reindeer, depending on who you ask, migrating south along routes that we’ve been tracking for the last three weeks via satellite imagery. I have binoculars trained on them for hours at a time, jotting numbers into my notebook: approximate numbers, distances, gait patterns, any irregularities in their movement. The herd stretches like a living ribbon across the tundra, pale brown against the undulating white. They move with the slow inevitability of glaciers, pausing only when their collective senses detect some subtle shift in the wind or a shadow against the snow.

It’s mesmerizing. There’s a rhythm to it, a pulse that reminds me of the earth’s slow, patient heartbeat. I’ve always thought wildlife observation was about patience. Sitting still long enough to notice the patterns that aren’t immediately obvious. This is nothing if not a test of patience.

The team keeps busy. Everwood calibrates the GPS sensors on our collars and tags, while Carter logs temperature, wind velocity, and humidity readings at fifteen-minute intervals. I note the behavior of the herd, occasionally calling out coordinates or asking a grad student to double-check a reading. Occasionally, the wind roars like an animal, and we all lean into it, hunching, gripping our notebooks and scopes, waiting for it to pass.

And then I notice it.

A pale movement on the horizon. At first, I think it’s a reflection, a trick of the binocular lenses. The Arctic sun sits low, sharp against the ice, throwing glints that make shapes appear where none exist. I adjust the focus, check the diopter on my binoculars. The shape persists. It’s white, almost the exact hue of the snow around it, though it moves in a deliberate, upright manner. Too upright to be drift or a cloud.

I frown. My first thought is some optical distortion, perhaps something on the lenses themselves. I wipe them clean with a cloth, recalibrate the focus. And yet it moves. Slowly. Purposefully. Its pace matches nothing I’ve seen before, not the herd, not the shadows, not the way wind-driven snow drifts. My pen hovers over the page as I scribble a note:

*“Pale shape observed on the horizon. Movement appears consistent. Lens distortion likely.”*

I don’t mention it to the team. There’s no need to. We’ve seen illusions in the ice before: mirages that stretch the horizon, shadows that resolve into nothing. Everwood is calling out numbers for the GPS collaring; Patel mutters measurements under her breath. The grad students are arguing quietly about whether the herd’s movement indicates a northern predator might be nearby. None of them notice the pale movement.

Or perhaps, like me, they choose not to.

The herd continues south. The males keep their heads down, antlers swaying like pendulums in the cold wind. One of the younger calves stumbles and catches itself, shaking snow from its fur. I record the incident.

There’s a harmony in the chaos of survival here, each small moment has significance. Observing this herd is more than data collection; it’s watching a cycle of life unfold in real time, one I’ve only ever read about in abstracts and journals.

I glance back at the pale shape. Still moving, still indistinct. I convince myself again: snow glare, lens aberration, optical anomaly. I’ve worked in the field long enough to know better than to trust first impressions. Still, there’s a faint rhythm to its motion that seems… deliberate. Almost like pacing. My scientific mind reels at the absurdity.

Who or what would pace in the Arctic, eight miles away, alone, in the cold? I shrug it off.

By midday, the team takes lunch inside the station. Hot water bottles, freeze-dried meals, instant coffee. I peer out the observation window toward the horizon. The herd is nearly off the ridge; I estimate we have an hour before they pass the southern monitoring point.

The pale shape is still there. I adjust the focus again, and I swear for a brief second, it seems aligned with the ridge marker, as if it has tracked the movement of our instruments. I jot it down\*.\*

Carter looks over my shoulder, curious about my scribbles. “*Another blizzard illusion?”* she asks, her tone light. I nod, smile, and close the notebook. It’s harmless. It has to be.

Afternoon brings more observation. The herd’s movement patterns are unusually tight today, calves clustered near adult females, males keeping a wide perimeter. We log each GPS coordinate. Everwood comments on subtle changes in migratory speed, about 10% slower than satellite tracking predicted. I record this with interest. Minor variations happen in every herd. Nothing alarming.

Yet, the pale shape remains. It doesn’t veer toward the herd. Doesn’t retreat. Doesn’t approach. Simply persists on the horizon. I cannot confirm species. Could be a distant snowdrift catching the sun just right. Could be a lone Arctic hare, though the proportions seem wrong. Could be a shadow stretched by the low sun. The mind wants to rationalize. Data must come first. Observation above speculation.

The day progresses without incident. Snow swirls around the station like fine sand, glinting like crushed diamonds under the pale sun. Wind drums against the walls, carrying echoes from the ridge. Occasionally, I catch the faint sound of cracking ice far off, something moving beneath frozen lakes. I record it, though no one else notices. Most likely ice shifts, I tell myself.

Evening arrives. Shadows grow long, though the sun remains stubbornly low. The herd moves past the southern point, heading out of sight. I log the last coordinates. The pale shape, if it was ever there at all, has vanished as subtly as it appeared.

We return to the station for the night. I spend hours transferring data, calibrating instruments, reviewing observations. The horizon beyond the observation window is empty and featureless. My binoculars rest on the sill. For a fleeting moment, I think I see a shimmer of white, half a mile from the ridge, but it disappears before I can focus. Likely fatigue. Likely optical effect. Likely nothing.

I close my journal for the night, noting the herd’s passage and the day’s measurements. Temperature readings steady, wind speeds consistent, GPS trackers functioning normally. Everything in order. And yet, my pen hesitates for a final line:

*Pale shape observed briefly; optical distortion likely. Observation continued.*

The Arctic remains silent outside, save for the occasional groan of ice and the whistling wind. The station feels small, insignificant against the vast expanse. The team sleeps fitfully, unaware of anything beyond the data, as am I. Tomorrow brings another day of tracking, and I remind myself: the horizon is deceptive.

I’m creating a diary for my intermittent fasting journey. I have been attempting to fast for 20:4 for the last 3 years or so, but never succeeded for more than a day or two.

After completely removing sweetener and creamers from my fasting routine, I have had much better success at being consistent for about a week now (started 5 Feb 2026, it is now 13 Feb 2026).

I am also incorporating collagen, gelatin, any type of tea, and a maximum of 2 cups of coffee a day. If I’m really desperate for something sweet, I don’t mind a sugar free soda or energy drink. These don’t interrupt my fasting schedule as badly, but I have noticed that I get very hungry at around 2-3pm. If I have a nutritious and filling lunch, I do not get hungry at all until the following day.

Protocol:-

\-eat once a day between 17h00 - 20h00.

\-meals are not strict, except to eliminate wheat/gluten as I am allergic.

\-for fasting periods, stick to tea, collagen, gelatin, black coffee.",1,1771016282.0,u_No_Objective_9067,0,1.0,False

I gave him a T-shirt that he had mentioned before, along with a letter. I didn’t receive any gift, but we went on a date. We actually wanted to go somewhere nice, but we couldn’t because of our circumstances and had to stay at the same place where we usually hang out.

I still wanted to make it a perfect day, so I dressed up and went on a date with him. He looked shabby and tired. I gave him the gift, and he apologized for not bringing anything for me. I said it was okay, and he bought me my favorite food. We spent some time together and decided to go back home.

On our way, he said he wanted to have a cup of coffee, and I asked him whether I should buy him one (it was purely out of love). He replied that he wouldn’t mooch off anybody. I asked if there is any “mooching” between lovers and told him I was doing it out of love. He then said that I was mooching off him and told me to pay him back for the food we ate. It made me so angry. I paid him all the money, and he kept pulling my leg. Later, he laughed and said it was a joke.

One thing I had always told him was not to keep score, and he did exactly that especially on Valentine’s Day. He tried to talk normally in chat later, but I was still upset and told him there wouldn’t be any more dates. The argument went on and on. Instead of apologizing, he kept defending himself. Finally, I told him that he had ruined Valentine’s Day for me. He got angry and didn’t want to talk to me. I felt bad and called him. He cut the call and said he didn’t care if I cried or whatever.

I was sad and blocked him for two days. We broke up later, but I cried and begged him to stay, so we got back together. After two months, we had our final breakup.

Even after terrible experiences, I miss him. I genuinely miss him. I loved him deeply, and I have never been so attached to someone. I’m going crazy right now. I can’t talk to anyone in real life because how long can I keep talking about him? People have their own things to do.

I just wish my mind and heart would be at peace one day. I know it wouldn’t have worked out between us, even if we had gotten back together, yet I still miss everything. He seems to be doing well in life right now. He probably doesn’t even think about me because he has no time for it. I wonder how it’s so easy for some people.

From the outside, a collagen coffee, an energy drink, and a ""focus"" capsule all feel like the same category. 

On the back end, they live under very different expectations:

A food or beverage is supposed to nourish you or provide normal dietary intake: think protein shakes, electrolyte drinks, snack bars, and RTD coffees. 

The claims live in the world of ""supports normal hydration"" or ""provides 20 g of protein.""

A dietary supplement/nutraceutical is usually a capsule, tablet, powder, or shot that’s not positioned as a conventional food. It can make structure/function claims like ""supports joint health"" or ""helps maintain healthy blood sugar""—but it’s still not allowed to claim to treat, cure, or prevent disease.

The messy part is all the hybrids:

A canned drink with 200 mg of caffeine, no calories, and ""focus + metabolism support"" on the label, sold next to energy drinks, regulated more like a supplement.

A gummy that looks like candy, tastes like candy, and is sold like candy, but the fine print says ""dietary supplement"" and lists serving sizes and daily values.

A ""functional"" bar with probiotics, adaptogens, and no clear line between snack and supplement.

Behind the scenes, the line is less about what the product looks like and more about:

How it’s labeled (Nutrition Facts vs. Supplement Facts).

What kinds of claims the brand makes (nutrition vs. structure/function vs. illegal drug claims).

How the brand markets it (as part of your diet vs. something you ""take"" like a pill).

From manufacturing, we often make nearly identical formulas that end up in totally different categories based on packaging, claims, and strategy, not chemistry! Wild!

1r40t8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/LuxuryTravel/comments/1r40t8j/in_conversation_with_hugo_montanari_managing/,"In Conversation With Hugo Montanari, Managing Director of Rosewood Hong Kong","A few years ago, I visited Rosewood Hong Kong, my very first Rosewood property and was lucky enough to be guided by Mr. Shinya-san, the Director of Sales. What stayed with me wasn’t just the views or design, it was his thoughtfulness. He pointed out tiny details that might have gone unnoticed, like the octagonal hand soaps, for example and the wallpaper draping the walls. In Hong Kong and China, the number 8 is considered the luckiest number, symbolizing prosperity and wealth. I found that fascinating because, in my culture, #8 represents hard work and is generally considered unlucky, almost the opposite.

Shinya-san’s stories brought the city to life through the hotel, showing how cultural nuances are woven into every corner. That experience naturally led to a conversation many years later with Hugo Montanari, the Managing Director. Having worked across Dubai, New York, India, China, and more, Hugo brings a truly global perspective that shows in every detail and every interaction guests have. He shares how trust, empathy, and thoughtful leadership guide every decision and moment at the hotel.

While you might not care about the shape of a hand soap or who designed the hotel **(interiors by Tony Chi)**, that same attention to detail is reflected in the service. A small example: at the **Manor Club**, they’ll remember your name, room number, and even your daily coffee or tea preference, without you having to repeat it (a personal pet peeve of mine). It’s the human touch behind these details that makes a visit feel effortless and personal. The Manor Club is truly where the service shines.

**Pro Tip:** Explore the hotel’s art collection on the *“*[Artistic Journey of Discovery](https://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/hong-kong/experiences/calendar/artistic-journey-of-discovery)*”*, a one-hour private tour led by the resident art ambassador. You’ll see 400+ pieces up close, and the tour is available in English, Cantonese, or Mandarin. If you’re into **horse racing**, the team can even help arrange a visit. And don’t miss a drink at **Darkside,** the bar itself is ranked among Asia’s 50 Best Bars. For those with a sweet tooth, the **Taro Cake** from the **Butterfly Patisserie** is not to be missed, it's a real treat.

If you’re wondering how to make a stay like this even more seamless, [Rosewood Elite](https://thesuitesojourn.com/partners/rosewood-elite/) offers exclusive benefits, think priority upgrades at the time of booking and curated experiences but the hotel can also be booked via FHR and other ways of course.

Talking with Hugo, it became clear that the people behind a hotel and the care they bring shape how a city and a hotel is experienced.

**Has anyone else visited Rosewood Hong Kong?** I’d love to hear which moments or people made it unforgettable for you. Happy to answer questions about room categories.

I am currently looking to start a new campaign with a full crew of 2-3 players. I have a group of 3 players ready to go, but had some scheduling conflicts with some other players who had signed up to play.  The adventure will take place in my homebrew World of Tolbyccia, specifically on the continent of Asteria. This will be the third time I have run a group through this story and world.

**About the story:**

For centuries, the Wardenfall Academy was the highest place of learning on Tolbyccia. Students from the 5 alliances within Asteria and from continents beyond would dedicate their lives to be accepted as one of the new students each year, only the best and brightest would get to call themselves Academy students.

Then, ten years ago, the doors never opened and the grounds became inaccessible due to a magical barrier preventing entry. The Wardenfall academy failed to welcome a new class for the first time since its inception.

The world moved on, yet the Academy still stands, silent and untouchable and whatever ended Wardenfall’s reign of knowledge remains locked behind its walls

**About Me**:

* My name is Austin, from Ontario, Canada
* I am 34 years old
* I have about 12 years of experience of D&D and other TTRPGs, mostly as a DM. I’ve run a few pre-written campaigns and games in my homebrew world.
* I love building my own worlds, cities and the people that reside within them.
* I have a pretty busy office job in education. I am technically on-call all week, 6AM to midnight, interruptions rarely occur, and anything that does come up usually is minor and will take less than 5-10 minutes.

* No previous experience required.
* 18+.
* English speaking
* Able to consistently commit to sessions (session details below).
   * If you are not able to make a session, a couple of days' notice would be greatly appreciated.

* Using species and classes from the 2024 PHB **only**.
* Set in my homebrew world of Asteria.
* The story will go from level 1 to level 11/12.
* No in game or out of game bullying/racism/harassment/etc.
* Roleplay/Combat, I would say the ratio is 50/50.
* Puzzles do make appearances.
* I do my best to make each NPC you encounter sound unique and different, unfortunately, I have ZERO talent when it comes to doing voices, but I will still always try and am usually pretty light hearted about it!
* I try to follow the “rule of cool” as much as possible, but won’t let it break the game.
* Be in it for the long haul. 
   * If you don’t like my DM style after the first couple of sessions, let me know. I will do my best to address your concerns. If it’s something that still doesn’t meet your expectations, no hard feelings. Let me know and we can look for someone to fill your spot.

* This is not first-come-first-serve, and I will be taking applications until I’m completely sure I have everyone I need to start. If the post doesn’t say “Closed”, it’s not closed. 
* I will review applications, looking for 2-3 players that compliment those that I have already lined up for the game.
* I am looking at a pretty quick turnaround, so keep an eye on your Discord friend requests!

**Questions?**

* If you have questions, I don't check reddit too often so I may not see your question if you post it. There is a spot in the Google Form linked above for questions, which I will be monitoring much more closely. I will take questions and post them back into the post every couple of days.

but more comforting than the softest pillow

.

I feel such warmth in your embrace

.

I want to breathe you in my sleep

and see you when I awake

.

Somehow you grow more and more beautiful with every passing day

.

You are the sweetest breeze

in the August heat

The warmest mittens

in a winter freeze

.

You are the perfect day

in my spring of springs

.

And I will do all that I can do

to deserve you

1r40ogs,https://www.thenexthoops.com/ncaaw/mid-majors/carla-berube-dominant-record-princeton-womens-basketball-tufts-uconn/,How Carla Berube has been so dominant at Princeton,"Carla Berube has “no clue” how the superstition started. But now it’s the stuff of legend for Princeton women’s basketball.

The day before each game, Berube starts practice by making a halfcourt shot, which she launches like she’s throwing a football. Her assistant coaches rebound her misses and encourage her as the players warm up on the other half of the court. And once Berube makes it, all the coaches run down the court and lob alley-oops off the backboard to each other, finishing with an alley-oop layup.

“There’s some [days] where she’s nailed it on the first try this year — first, second or third,” assistant coach Jordan Edwards told The IX Basketball. “… Those are those days where you feel really good.”

Berube estimates that the tradition started in 2010 or 2011, about halfway through her tenure at Division III Tufts. About 15 years later, it’s entrenched alongside her many other superstitions, from ordering the same pregame coffee to changing players’ hotel roommates after a road loss.

“Even as a high school player, I had superstitions or routines,” Berube told The IX Basketball. “So it’s just been a part of me. It makes me feel just relaxed, that I’m doing the right things.”

Superstitions are also often about good luck, and the irony is that Berube is one of the least likely coaches at any level of basketball to need luck on her side. After winning a national championship as a player at UConn in 1995, she spent two seasons as an assistant coach at Providence before getting the Tufts job in 2002. She stayed until 2019, going 384-96 (0.800) and making two DIII national championship games and nine Sweet 16 appearances.",5,1771015640.0,NCAAW,0,1.0,False
1r40ofi,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1r40ofi/m4f_madly_in_love_with_rachel_mcadams/,[M4F] Madly In Love With Rachel McAdams,"It had been two weeks since the 20-something year-old moved in with his unlikely best friend, Rachel McAdams. It was certainly one of the more fortunate things to happen in his life, considering how much darkness he grew up around, and he still couldn't believe this unusual stroke of good luck. To him, she was Home; he felt safe anywhere, as long as she was right there beside him.

Rachel had sadly been more of a mom to the young man than his actual mother, and as his personal stress began to pile up every now and again, he found himself needing her more and more; needing her hugs, needing her touch, needing her advice, and needing her love. 

As the weeks went by, this instinctual urge to profess his love to her grew. God, she was absolutely gorgeous; her warm, inquisitive green eyes, luscious brown hair, the way she carried herself with such grace....Ms. McAdams was easily the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen in his life. And he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her, blurred lines be damned.

Later that night, in that shy, soft voice she'd grown so accustomed to, he asked a simple question with the utmost anxiety coursing through him: ""Can we....take things to the next level?""

\\---------------------

Whether you know her from Mean Girls, The Notebook, True Detective S2, Game Night, and/or Send Help most recently just to name a few, something about Rachel McAdams just stays with you. Her warm aura, playful greenish hazel eyes, her flattering figure....I'm almost never able to get a roleplay story with her up off the ground somehow.

That's where you fine people would come in. I'm open to most ideas, but right now I have something very wholesome and emotional in mind, and would prefer for this to be more of a faceclaim scenario. The main basis for the story I have in mind essentially entails her 40-something self falling in love with a much younger man around 19-22.

They could've met as neighbors, dormmates, through a mutual friend, or a chance encounter at a grocery store or coffee shop. And I would very much enjoy toeing the line between ""mother figure"" and ""lover"", with plenty of slice of life moments in there to make everything feel realistic, sweet, and most importantly, earned! And the fact that Rachel apparently loves to cuddle IRL just fills me with an indescribable amount of inspiration.

I would also like to explore an ""Opposites Attract"" angle with the two of them, with him being the less fortunate of the two, if that's something that speaks to you at all.

This is also predominantly MD/lb-focused, if that affects your preference in any way.

It helps if you're familiar with some of Rachel's work, although she doesn't HAVE to be a celebrity in this story. Tell me your favorite color as well as why this pitch speaks to you so that I know you've read all of this. Thank you all in advance",1,1771015638.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

Also not advisable if you need good sleep the night of.

The advice: I'm in university right now and for a few reasons don't have proper medication. As many do, I have finals week right now (or month, in my case). I used to drink coffee a lot, about 4 cups a day every day. One day about two months ago I had to stop. When I could drink it again I was studying for an exam, and a sudden mental clarity kicked in for the whole day I never experienced before.

So I tried it. A few days before an upcoming exam (at least 3 full days), I quit all caffeine. The day of the exam, about half an hour before I drank coffee and the mental clarity was back. I've been doing this a few times since.

PSA from what I've learned: I overdid it the first time. I had coffee before and during the exam, mentally I was fine and had a normal heartbeat but my hands were shaking. Also I become pretty anxious and talk too fast the rest of the day, hence the warnings. Obviously this isn't replacement for medication, I wish I didn't have to do this, nor is it healthy long term but it is something at least to try when you absolutely can't focus for that long on something that important.",2,1771015548.0,ADHDers,0,1.0,False

I’ve opted for the Lelit Anita with the integrated grinder because of space and money. I wasn’t 100% sure if this is a hobby I want to pursue and didn’t want to spend a whole lot more for my first setup. 

I think the grind quality looks good I have attached a picture of the coffee ground. It’s not the best coffee beans sine I still had some left and didn’t want to throw them away. 

Taste wise I’m already really happy and I’m pulling consistent shots at 9 bar. 

I’m still having much trouble with milk texturing is it the machine or is it the user ? Any tips are highly appreciated. 

Is the bottomless portafilter worth to get ? 

Equipment wise I opted for a normcore tamper with self leveling and a fixed pressure. I also got the subminimal flick because it’s satisfying. 

I still need to find some nice espresso cups. I only got these game of thrones ones I already had.

Anyways..ive wanted to get my first microbrand watch and ive followed the community closely. maybe a few months ago i discovered HZ watches. I really love my quartz watches, i have few automatics and i understand the appeal but in the end i always default to a quartz watch for day to day. 

Finally decided it was time to get a watch from HZ when i stumbled upon a Chinese new year edition. Never had a red watch and it looked really good and honestly its brilliant. i wont make an essay here ( i hope) as this is my first ever attempt to write anything of this kind but for the past week i haven't taken this watch off and here are some of my findings if you want to pull the trigger on one of these

\-legibility is an issue most of the time. mirror hands with white lume on a shiny metallic disk makes reading the time for me an issue but i knew it would be before i even got it.

\-lume is basically non existent. even after direct sunlight during a coffee break it is weak to the point where im starting to wonder is my unit defective on that part, its there but its basically useless and lasts for 15 minutes tops. ive got an honesty brilliant idea for this watch specifically. reach out if you are interested hahah

\-the on hand feel is simply amazing and its the most comfortable watch ive ever tried. its weightless, all the edges are smooth, i absolutely love it.

\- the crystal is so clear that most of the time you feel as tho you can touch the dial, absolutely the best AR coating i have seen in a long time.

\-the pop of the watch is also something ive noticed, never in my life have people around me asked what watch is this, its really beautiful paired with a white alcantara strap.

Is it perfect?  No, but its really damn close honestly.

Will i buy more from HZ? I absolutely will.",8,1771015059.0,MicrobrandWatches,4,0.91,False

1r40csu,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1r40csu/rf_when_the_rain_finally_fell/,[RF] When the Rain Finally Fell,"Hello everyone. I am new here and would like to share my work. Please sit back and enjoy this story I’ve written. Grab a snack or drink if you so choose lol. 

When Caleb met Alina, she was standing barefoot in the grass behind her aunt’s house, arguing passionately with the sky. “You can’t just threaten rain all afternoon and not commit,” she said, hands on her hips. Caleb had never seen anyone scold a cloud before. He fell in love a little right then. They were nineteen. Everything about them felt unfinished and full of possibility. Caleb loved how Alina spoke her mind without hesitation. Alina loved how Caleb listened—really listened—as if every word she said mattered enough to hold carefully in his hands. They dated through cheap pizza nights and long drives with no destination. They learned each other’s rhythms: he hummed when he was nervous; she cleaned when she was overwhelmed. When Caleb proposed on a foggy hill overlooking the city, Alina cried before he even finished asking. Eight years later, their house smelled like lavender and coffee. They had a golden retriever named Sunday and a habit of falling asleep halfway through whatever show they were watching. From the outside, their life was the kind people pointed at and said, “That’s what I want.” But love, Caleb would learn, is not the same thing as knowing.

⸻

The letter arrived on a Tuesday. It wasn’t dramatic —no bold red stamp or ominous handwriting. Just a plain white envelope addressed to Caleb in ink that looked oddly familiar. Alina was at work. Caleb opened it absently while standing at the kitchen counter. Inside was a single folded sheet. ‘You deserve to know the truth. Alina isn’t who you think she is. Look into the name Mara Vance. 2016. Brook Hollow’. There was no signature. Caleb read it three times. Mara Vance. The name meant nothing to him. 2016. The year he and Alina had started dating. A chill crept up his spine, slow and deliberate. He told himself it was a prank. A mistake. Someone with a grudge. But that night, while Alina slept curled against him, he lay awake staring at the ceiling, the name echoing like a dropped coin spinning endlessly in his mind.

⸻

He searched the next day. Brook Hollow was a small town two hours away. In 2016, a woman named Mara Vance had been charged in connection with a house fire that killed a man — her boyfriend. Suspicion of arson. Insufficient evidence. Case unresolved. The article had a grainy photo. Caleb’s breath left him. The hair was darker. Shorter. The face thinner. But the eyes — they were Alina’s eyes. Not similar. The same. His hands began to shake. The article ended with a line: Mara Vance relocated shortly after the investigation concluded. Relocated. In 2016. The year Alina moved to his city. The year she told him she needed a “fresh start.” Caleb felt something inside him splinter — not loudly, not dramatically. Just a quiet crack.

⸻

He didn’t confront her immediately. He watched her. He hated himself for it. He watched how she laughed at a text from her coworker. How she knelt to refill Sunday’s water bowl. How she kissed him absentmindedly on the cheek while passing through the kitchen. Was any of it real? Or had he married someone who burned her past to the ground — literally? Three nights later, he placed the article on the dining table. Alina walked in from work, dropped her keys into the bowl, and froze when she saw his face. “What’s wrong?” she asked. He slid the paper toward her. The color drained from her cheeks before she even picked it up. The silence stretched. Her hands trembled as she read. When she finished, she didn’t deny it. She didn’t pretend. She just sat down slowly. “My name was Mara,” she said. The room tilted. Caleb’s throat felt tight. “So it’s true?” She looked up at him, eyes glassy but steady. “Yes. But not the way it sounds.” “That man died, Alina.” “I know.” Her voice cracked. “I think about it every day.” Rage flared in Caleb’s chest. “You let me marry you without telling me.” Tears spilled down her face. “Because if I told you the worst thing that ever happened to me on our third date, you would have walked away.” “You don’t know that.” “I do.” She swallowed hard. “Everyone did.”

⸻

Eight years earlier, she’d been nineteen and reckless in love with a man named Daniel. He was charming in public and volatile in private. The night of the fire, they had fought. He’d been drinking. She’d locked herself in the bathroom while he raged. She said she didn’t know how the fire started. She remembered smoke. She remembered screaming. She remembered waking up outside with neighbors shouting and flames devouring the house. Daniel never made it out. Investigators questioned her for weeks. They found traces of accelerant but no proof tying it to her. Some believed she’d done it. Others thought Daniel had knocked over something in his drunken fury. No charges stuck. But the town had already decided. Mara Vance was a killer. “So you changed your name,” Caleb said hollowly. “I changed my life,” she whispered. “I couldn’t survive as her anymore. Every grocery store aisle felt like a courtroom.” “Why didn’t you tell me later? After we were serious? Before the wedding?” She met his eyes, and what he saw there wasn’t manipulation. It was terror. “Because I didn’t know how to say it without losing you.” The truth hung between them, raw and jagged.

⸻

Caleb left that night. He drove without direction until the city lights blurred. His mind replayed every memory with her — first kiss, wedding vows, lazy Saturday mornings. Had he loved Alina? Or had he loved the version she constructed? But another thought gnawed at him: What if she was telling the truth? What if the worst thing in her life wasn’t something she did — but something she survived? For days, he wrestled with anger and doubt. He revisited the case files. There was no proof. Just suspicion. A young woman trapped in a small town tragedy. He called the lead investigator listed in an old article. The man was retired now. “I always thought she was more scared than guilty,” the investigator admitted. “Didn’t fit the profile. But fear makes people run. And running looks like guilt.”

⸻

When Caleb returned home, Alina was sitting on the living room floor with Sunday, eyes hollow from lack of sleep. She didn’t stand. “I won’t fight you if you want to leave,” she said quietly. “You deserved the truth years ago. I was selfish.” Caleb crouched in front of her. “Were you ever going to tell me?” “Yes.” Her answer was immediate. “When I felt strong enough to survive losing you.” He studied her face — the woman he’d built a life with. The woman who burned pancakes and sang off-key and held his hand during his father’s funeral. “You didn’t lie about who you are,” he said slowly. “You just hid where you came from. She let out a broken sob. “I don’t know what to do with this,” he admitted. “I’m angry. I’m hurt. But I don’t see a monster when I look at you.” She searched his face like someone waiting for a verdict. “I see my wife,” he finished. The relief that flooded her expression was almost painful to witness. “But,” he continued gently, “if we’re staying married, there are no more shadows. We talk about this. We unpack it. Together.” She nodded through tears. “Anything.”

⸻

Months later, they sat in a therapist’s office, peeling back layers neither of them knew existed. Trust rebuilt slowly—like laying bricks one by one after a storm. Caleb never fully erased the image of that article. It would always be part of their story. But so would forgiveness. And one quiet evening, as rain finally committed to the sky and tapped steadily against their windows, Caleb realized something: Love isn’t the absence of darkness. It’s choosing to stay when the light flickers.

I’m genuinely trying to figure out whether I’ve been insecure/overreacting, or whether I’ve been tolerating things that most people wouldn’t be okay with.

We ultimately broke up after a fight about me liking some girls’ Instagram photos (including one girl I had a past fling with years ago). I apologized many times and genuinely understand that liking certain photos can hurt your partner. She said my apology wasn’t good enough and things escalated.

Here’s the broader relationship history that’s making me question everything:

**Early Ex Issues:**

* She told me she had blocked her ex before we started dating.
* About a year into us dating, I saw posts of that ex inside her apartment.
* I later found out she had been on a “business” trip with him via one of his posts.
* There’s also a post from when we first started dating of him kissing her on the cheek.
* During this entire period, she was texting me, sleeping with me, and presenting our relationship as exclusive.

**The Night I Walked In On Him:**

* I once walked into her apartment and her ex was there while she was sleeping on the couch.
* She said she had him blocked and that he used an old spare key from when they lived together.
* She claimed she passed out before she could tell him to leave.
* That same night, she had been out at a bar and was texting a guy she met that night. She says she told him she had a boyfriend, but one of the texts I saw said: “hey bb, where did you guys end up going to?”

**Ex In Her Bed Later:**

* Months later, that same ex posted an Instagram story from her bed.
* I called her and politely asked her to ask him to leave.
* She refused because she didn’t want confrontation and let him stay until 3pm the next day.

**July 4th Incident:**

* She had been texting another guy for about two months.
* On July 4th at the beach she was very friendly and touchy with him.
* Later that night I saw texts to her friend saying she liked him. Her friend responded “OMG are you with him now?”
* When I confronted her, she screamed at me and left to go pick him up and take him home.
* The next day she sent me screenshots supposedly telling him I was her priority. I later found out she manipulated those screenshots and had actually apologized to him about me being “drama.”
* When I spoke to the guy, he said she told him we were broken up. She denies that.

**Male Friend Boundaries:**

* I’ve seen her roll over in bed next to me and text a male friend “I’m just so depressed.” That same guy had previously DM’d her “let’s run away together.” She said that’s just his personality and she’s numb to it.
* She has gone one-on-one for coffee multiple times with a married guy friend.
* She also went to an ice bath/sauna one-on-one with him.
* She sometimes hides notifications from certain male friends.
* She posts constantly on social media but has rarely posted me in 3 years. I’ve expressed that public acknowledgment makes me feel secure.

**My Side / Where I Messed Up:**

* I shouldn’t have liked certain girls’ photos, especially someone I had history with.
* I once got a girl’s number while out. We texted briefly before I told her I had a girlfriend. When she asked to get drinks, I declined and told her I had a girlfriend. I disclosed this to my partner.
* I’ve brought up past unresolved issues during apology conversations, which escalated things.
* During one heated argument, I called her a horrible name when overwhelmed (I deeply regret that).
* I can get defensive when I feel cornered.

She can be very loving and supportive. But I haven’t felt emotionally safe in a long time. I often feel like there are double standards and that I’m constantly proving I’m a good person. We are together ALL the time and it does feel like she loves me (at times) but this has never felt like normal relationship stuff. 

I'm mad at myself for not dipping out way earlier when these first few major red flags started popping up. Same pattern, she apolgizes, promises repair and then every few months it's something new. 

My question:

Is this just modern dating and I need to work on my insecurity and jealousy?

Or would most people feel uncomfortable with these patterns?

I genuinely want to grow and be a better partner. I just don’t know if I’ve been reacting to normal behavior or ignoring serious boundary issues.

So I decided to give the coffee shop speed dating another shot now that I know you need an app to match with people in real life if you want to talk to them after the event. So I bought another ticket. Another $30. Then I messed with a girl on hinge we went out and the bill for that date was $50 and it didn’t work out and that got me thinking if I’m spending this much on one day maybe I should just spend the $50 on the jigsaw membership so I can try to reach out to those girls that I did have a connection with in the first speed dating event. So I decided to go ahead and buy the membership even though I had already bought a ticket too. Another $50. Then I messaged the women that I felt I had a connection with. They never replied. And now I am sick with adenovirus which I very likely caught at the first speed dating event (I WFH and have not been out much since then). And I am going to have to cancel plans I made with another girl I met on hinge for Valentine’s Day bc I need to quarantine due to being contagious.

TL;DR - Jigsaw has $110 of my money, gave me an upper respiratory infection, and I will still be alone for Valentine’s Day. Don’t be dumb like me.

1r409x5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidMen/comments/1r409x5/master_your_presence_the_psychology_of_attraction/,Master Your PRESENCE: The Psychology of Attraction Without Saying a Word,"

I've been studying charisma, attraction, and social dynamics for years now. read tons of books, research papers, listened to countless podcasts. And here's what nobody tells you: the most magnetic people in any room aren't the loudest or the most talkative. They've mastered something way more powerful. their presence speaks volumes before they even open their mouth.

Most people think being attractive means looking good or saying the right things. But after diving deep into behavioral psychology and studying what actually makes people compelling, I realized we've got it backwards. Your body language, energy, and the way you occupy space communicate more in 30 seconds than words could in 30 minutes.

Your body is constantly broadcasting signals

Vanessa Van Edwards talks about this extensively in her work on nonverbal intelligence. She found that people form impressions within milliseconds of meeting you, and these judgments are based almost entirely on nonverbal cues. Your posture, facial expressions, and even how you walk into a room are telling a story about your confidence and self worth.

The problem is most of us are walking around slumped over our phones, avoiding eye contact, taking up as little space as possible. We're literally shrinking ourselves. And then we wonder why people don't notice us or take us seriously.

Start paying attention to how you move through the world. Are you rushing everywhere with your head down? Do you cross your arms defensively? These tiny habits are killing your presence. Amy Cuddy's research on power posing showed that even two minutes of expansive body language can literally change your hormonal profile, increasing testosterone and decreasing cortisol. Your body shapes your mind, which then shapes how others perceive you.

Master the art of comfortable silence

The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane completely changed how I think about presence. She breaks down charisma into three core elements: presence, power, and warmth. And the foundation of all three is being fully present in the moment.

Most people are terrible at this. They're planning what to say next, checking their phone every five seconds, or mentally somewhere else entirely. But when you give someone your complete attention, when you're genuinely present with them, it's magnetic. People feel seen and valued. That's insanely rare these days.

And here's the counterintuitive part: you don't need to fill every silence with words. Comfortable silence is a flex. It shows you're secure enough to not need constant validation through talking. Practice just being still and present without the urge to perform or entertain.

Your eye contact reveals everything

Eye contact might be the most underrated social skill. Too little makes you seem shifty or insecure. Too much gets creepy and aggressive. But when you nail it, it creates instant connection.

The sweet spot is maintaining eye contact for about 60 to 70 percent of a conversation. Break it naturally, don't stare like a psychopath, but also don't look away every two seconds. Mark Bowden's work on body language emphasizes that eye contact should feel like a gift you're giving, not a challenge you're issuing.

Try this: when someone's talking, actually look at them. Don't let your eyes dart around the room. Don't glance at your phone. Just be there. It's such a simple thing but most people can't do it for more than a few seconds.

Energy management is attraction management

Your energy level affects everything. Low energy reads as depression or disinterest. Manic energy comes across as desperate or unstable. The goal is calm, grounded energy with occasional spikes of enthusiasm when appropriate.

This is where apps like Atom (habit tracking specifically designed around energy optimization) can help you identify patterns. Maybe you're most magnetic in the mornings but turn into a zombie by 8pm. Use that information strategically for important meetings or dates.

BeFreed is an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni and Google experts that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio episodes. Instead of scrolling through endless content, type what you want to learn, like improving presence or reading body language, and it creates a custom learning plan with podcasts tailored to your goals. You control the depth too, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives packed with examples and context. The voice options are addictive, there's everything from calm and soothing to a smoky, confident tone that keeps you engaged during commutes or workouts. It actually covers all the books mentioned here and way more.

Sleep, exercise, and nutrition all impact your energy, which impacts your presence. You can't fake this stuff. When you're genuinely taking care of yourself, it radiates outward. People pick up on it even if they can't articulate why you seem different.

Stop performing, start existing

The biggest trap is thinking you need to be ""on"" all the time. Performing a version of yourself that you think people will like. That's exhausting and people can smell the inauthenticity from a mile away.

Your real presence comes from being comfortable in your own skin. Not trying to impress anyone. Not seeking validation. Just existing as yourself with confidence and openness. Paradoxically, this is when people find you most attractive.

Models by Mark Manson gets into this beautifully. He talks about how authentic confidence isn't about being perfect or having all the answers. It's about being okay with your imperfections and not hiding them. That vulnerability, when combined with self assurance, is incredibly powerful.

The space you occupy matters

Take up space. Not in an obnoxious way, but don't make yourself small either. Sit with your shoulders back. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Use hand gestures when you talk. These things signal confidence and make you more memorable.

I started noticing this after reading What Every Body is Saying by Joe Navarro. He's a former FBI agent who spent decades reading body language, and he points out that confident people are comfortable claiming their space. They don't fidget or retreat into themselves.

Practice this anywhere. At the coffee shop, in meetings, at parties. Just notice when you're making yourself smaller and consciously expand a bit. It feels weird at first but becomes natural.

Your vibe attracts your tribe

Here's the thing that took me forever to understand: you're not trying to be attractive to everyone. You're cultivating a presence that attracts the right people while filtering out the wrong ones.

When your presence is authentic and grounded, you naturally draw in people who vibe with that energy. And you repel people who don't. That's a feature, not a bug. Stop trying to appeal to everyone and start being magnetic to the people who matter.

Your presence is the sum of thousands of tiny choices you make every day. How you stand, where you look, the energy you bring, the space you occupy. None of this requires you to say a single word, but it speaks volumes about who you are.",1,1771014693.0,SolidMen,0,1.0,False

1r407l4,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnfrench/comments/1r407l4/la_méthode_linguistique_lafon_mll/,La Méthode Linguistique Lafon (MLL),"# Introduction

This guide documents the methodology I used to reach DELF B2-level French proficiency in approximately 1,000 hours of study over 12-14 months. The approach centers on comprehensible input theory, spaced repetition systems, and strategic output practice, rather than traditional classroom-based language instruction.

The method is designed to be time-efficient and self-directed, suitable for adult learners who can dedicate 2-3 hours daily to language study.

# Core Principles

# The Comprehensible Input Hypothesis

Language acquisition occurs primarily through exposure to comprehensible input—content in the target language that is slightly above your current level but understandable through context. This approach de-emphasizes explicit grammar study in favor of pattern recognition through massive exposure.

The brain requires hundreds of hours to adapt to new sound patterns and grammatical structures. There is no shortcut to this neurological adaptation process. Attempts to accelerate it through intensive grammar drilling or translation exercises have consistently proven less effective than sustained immersion.

# The Role of Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition systems (SRS) like Anki leverage the psychological spacing effect to optimize vocabulary retention. Cards are reviewed at increasing intervals based on recall difficulty, ensuring efficient long-term memorization with minimal time investment. Most systems have existed for many years and are subject to constant update to reflect current neuroscience findings, however applications like Anki have been objectively shown to boost long-term memory and retention of a target language.

SRS is particularly effective for building foundational vocabulary (most common 1,000-2,000 words of a language) and for memorizing low-frequency but necessary vocabulary that appears infrequently in immersion content.

# Input-Output Ratio

The methodology maintains approximately a 9:1 ratio of input to output activities. This ratio ensures that output practice (speaking and writing) doesn’t develop too far ahead of comprehension ability, which can lead to fossilized errors and poor communication habits in the long-term.

Contrary to some immersion-heavy approaches that delay output until 1,500+ hours, this method introduces output practice around the 500-hour mark to develop productive skills in parallel with receptive skills.

# Phase 1: Foundation (Hours 0-100)

# Objective

Build basic phonological awareness and acquire the first 500-1,000 most common words. Develop comfort with basic sentence structures and pronunciation patterns.

# Primary Tools

Duolingo or Pimsleur: Use structured beginner courses for initial exposure. Duolingo provides gamified vocabulary introduction (15-30 minutes daily). Pimsleur offers audio-based pronunciation drilling in addition to common phrases and conversations (30 minutes per lesson).

*While these tools are insufficient for fluency, they provide accessible entry points for complete beginners. They introduce high-frequency vocabulary and basic grammatical patterns in a low-pressure format.*

# Time Allocation

**Duolingo/Pimsleur**: 30-45 minutes daily for vocabulary exposure

**Anki**: 5-10 minutes daily for foundational vocabulary upkeep

**Easy French/Coffee Break French Podcast**: 1 episode per day to prime phonetic familiarity.

**Total daily commitment**: 60-75 minutes

**Duration**: Approximately 6-8 weeks to reach 100 hours

# Expected Outcomes

Recognition of common words in written and spoken form, ability to produce basic tourist phrases, foundational understanding of pronunciation rules, and comfort with the sound patterns of the target language.

# Phase 2: Vocabulary Building and Passive Immersion (Hours 100-500)

# Objective

Rapidly expand vocabulary to 3,000-4,000 words while conditioning the brain to the sound patterns of native speech. Begin developing reading comprehension.

# Primary Activities

Create a custom Anki deck or use a high-quality pre-made frequency deck. Focus on practical, everyday vocabulary rather than literary or archaic terms.

*Deck composition recommendation: Use a visual dictionary (4,000-5,000 concrete nouns covering household items, foods, tools, clothing, etc.) supplemented with verb frequency lists. This ensures coverage of vocabulary that appears infrequently in media but is essential for daily life.*

**Daily routine**: Review all due cards without fail. New card introduction rate: 20-30 cards per day. Expected daily review time: 60-120 minutes depending on retention rates. You can lower it if you get overwhelmed, the key here is to be consistent.

# Passive Immersion

Begin consuming native content audio while performing activities that don’t require linguistic processing: cooking, cleaning, exercising, commuting, simple manual tasks.

Content sources: Podcasts (news, interview-based shows), YouTube videos (documentaries, vlogs), audiobooks, dubbed television shows.

**Target**: 1-2+ hours daily of passive audio exposure. This can be accumulated throughout the day during routine activities.

**Critical distinction:** Passive immersion effectiveness exists on a spectrum. Maximum benefit occurs during activities with low cognitive load (walking, simple chores). Minimal benefit occurs during high-cognitive-load activities (studying other subjects, complex problem-solving). Playing video games that require reading or strategic thinking falls into the low-benefit category.

# Active Immersion Introduction (Hour 200+)

Around hour 200-250, begin active engagement with visual multimedia: television shows, YouTube videos, films with target language subtitles.

Start with content slightly above current comprehension level. Expect to understand 30-50% on first viewing. The goal is not complete comprehension but exposure to authentic language use in context.

Recommended first show: Contemporary dramas with clear dialogue and strong visual context (*Lupin, Dix Pour Cent*). Avoid period pieces, dense comedies, or content with heavy slang until later.

**Active immersion time:** 30-60 minutes daily in early stages, increasing as comprehension improves.

# Grammar Approach

Minimize explicit grammar study during this phase. Grammar should be studied reactively—when you repeatedly encounter a pattern you don’t understand or keep making the same error.

**Exception**: *If your target language has verb conjugation patterns significantly different from your native language, maintain a reference list of 200-500 high-frequency verbs with their conjugations. Review these opportunistically rather than through drilling.*

**Common mistake to avoid:** Do not attempt to memorize complete conjugation tables for all tenses before you’ve encountered them in natural context. This is an inefficient use of study time and leads to abstract knowledge that doesn’t transfer to practical use.

# Time Allocation

**Anki reviews:** 30-60+ minutes daily

**Passive immersion:** 1-2 hours daily (accumulated throughout day)

**Active immersion:** 30-60 minutes daily (starting around hour 200)

**Total daily commitment:** 2-4 hours per day.

**Duration**: Approximately 12-16 weeks to accumulate 400 hours

# Expected Outcomes

Vocabulary base of 3,000-4,000 words, ability to follow plots of TV shows with 40-60% comprehension, recognition of common grammatical patterns, improved listening ability with native-speed speech.

This phase represents the **most difficult period psychologically.** Progress feels slow despite significant time investment. The breakthrough typically occurs around hour 500-600 when accumulated exposure reaches a critical threshold. You **CAN** quickly exit the beginner/intermediate plateau in two to three months with daily consistent work.

# Phase 3: Intermediate Development (Hours 500-1000)

# Objective

Develop active comprehension skills across all media types, begin systematic output practice, expand vocabulary to 5,000-6,000 words, and refine pronunciation and grammatical accuracy.

# Primary Activities

Active Immersion (Priority Focus)

Shift primary emphasis to active engagement with native content. This includes reading novels, watching films and television without subtitles, listening to podcasts with full attention.

**Content selection strategy:** Choose material at i+1 level (slightly above current ability). For reading, aim for 95%+ word recognition. For listening, aim for 70-85% comprehension. If comprehension drops below these thresholds, the content is too difficult and will provide diminishing returns.

**Target**: 2-3 hours daily of focused active immersion

# Sentence Mining

Extract sentences containing unknown vocabulary or interesting grammatical structures from your immersion content. Add these to Anki as sentence cards (full sentence on front, target word in bold, translation/explanation on back).

*This practice serves dual purposes: vocabulary expansion focused on personally relevant content, and reinforcement of grammatical patterns in natural context.*

**Rate:** 5-15 new sentence cards daily from immersion content

# Output Practice Introduction

Begin systematic output practice around hour 500. Maintain approximately 9:1 input-to-output ratio.

# Writing Practice:

**Daily journaling (10-15 minutes**): Write about daily activities, thoughts, plans in target language. Focus on fluency over accuracy initially.

**Structured composition (2-3x weekly)**: Use AI tools to generate writing prompts. Write 200-300 word responses. Have AI provide correction feedback.

# Speaking Practice:

**Self-recording (daily, 5-10 minutes):** Record yourself speaking about familiar topics. Listen back to identify pronunciation issues and unnatural phrasing.

**Conversation practice (1-2x weekly, 30-60 minutes)**: Use platforms like italki for tutoring sessions or language exchange. Focus on conversational fluency rather than grammatical perfection.

**Total output practice:** 45-90 minutes weekly, scaling up as you approach 1,000 hours

# Continued Anki Use

Continue daily Anki reviews but reduce new card introduction rate. Focus shifts from vocabulary acquisition to vocabulary retention and sentence mining. Ideal retention rate should be between 0.8-0.85.

**Expected review time**: 15-30 minutes daily (decreasing as mature card intervals lengthen)

# Passive Immersion (Maintenance)

Continue passive immersion during appropriate activities but recognize this is now supplementary rather than primary study method.

**Target**: 1-2 hours daily

# Grammar Refinement

At this level, implement targeted grammar study for persistent problem areas. If you repeatedly make the same error in output, consult grammar resources and do focused drills.

Specific areas for French learners: subjunctive mood, literary tenses (passé simple, plus-que-parfait), pronoun order, agreement rules for compound tenses.

**Grammar study time:** 15-30 minutes daily as needed, not as routine practice

# Time Allocation

**Active immersion:** 2-3 hours daily

**Anki reviews and sentence mining:** 30-60 minutes daily

**Output practice**: 45-90 minutes weekly

**Passive immersion**: 1-2 hours daily

**Total daily commitment:** 3-5 hours

**Duration**: Approximately 20-24 weeks to accumulate 500 hours

# Expected Outcomes

**By 1,000 hours:** B2-level competency across all skills. 80-95% comprehension of native content depending on domain specificity. Ability to express complex ideas in writing and speech with occasional errors. Vocabulary of 5,000-6,000 words with strong recognition and moderate production ability.

# Progress Tracking and Measurement

# Time Logging

Use Toggl Track or similar time-tracking software to log all study activities. Categorize by activity type: passive immersion, active immersion, Anki reviews, output practice, grammar study.

This provides objective data on effort distribution and reveals patterns in effective study. Monthly review of time logs enables strategic adjustments to methodology.

# Proficiency Benchmarking

CEFR alignment (approximate hours required):

1. A2: 200-300 hours of quality input

2. B1: 400-600 hours

3. B2: 750-1000 hours

4. C1: 1500-2000 hours

*These estimates assume mixed-quality input (combination of passive and active immersion). Higher-quality study hours (focused active immersion with output practice) accelerate progress.*

Consider taking official proficiency exams (DELF/DALF for French, DELE for Spanish, etc.) at appropriate intervals to validate progress and maintain motivation.

# Common Pitfalls and Corrections

# Premature Grammar Drilling

**Error:** Spending months memorizing conjugation tables and grammar rules before beginning immersion.

**Correction:** Grammar study should follow immersion, not precede it. Learn grammatical patterns as you encounter them in context.

# Overreliance on Gamified Apps

**Error:** Using Duolingo or similar apps as primary study method beyond the first 100 hours.

**Correction:** Transition to authentic native content and SRS systems as soon as basic vocabulary is established.

# Delayed Output Practice

**Error**: Waiting until 1,500-2,000 hours before attempting to speak or write.

**Correction**: Begin output practice around 500 hours to develop production skills in parallel with comprehension. Bad habits formed early can be corrected; complete avoidance of output creates artificially delayed productive ability.

# Low-Quality Passive Immersion

**Error**: Playing target language audio during cognitively demanding activities (studying other subjects, complex work tasks, engaging video games) and counting this as meaningful immersion.

**Correction**: Reserve passive immersion for activities with low cognitive load. Accept that not all logged hours are equally valuable.

# Vocabulary Deck Misalignment

**Error**: Using vocabulary decks focused on literary, archaic, or hyper-specialized terminology.

**Correction**: Prioritize high-frequency everyday vocabulary. Use visual dictionaries and frequency lists. Literary vocabulary can be acquired later through reading.

# Hour Inflation

**Error**: Logging hours spent with target language content playing but attention elsewhere, inflating hour counts without corresponding skill development.

**Correction**: Be honest in time tracking. Distinguish between focused and unfocused study time. Adjust methodology if logged hours don’t correlate with expected progress.

# Essential Tools and Resources

# Spaced Repetition

**Anki** (desktop and mobile): Primary SRS platform. Free, open-source, highly customizable. AnkiWeb provides cloud sync across devices.

# Time Tracking

**Toggl Track:** Time logging with categorization and reporting features. Enables data-driven methodology refinement.

# Content Sources

**Netflix**: Large catalog of international content with target language audio and subtitles

**YouTube:** Free content at all proficiency levels. Search for ‘easy \[language\]’ channels for graded content

**Podcast platforms:** Spotify, Apple Podcasts for native-level audio content

**Digital libraries:** Kindle, Google Books for reading practice

# Output Practice

**italki**: Platform for hiring tutors and finding language exchange partners

**ChatGPT or Claude**: AI tools for writing prompts, corrections, and conversation practice (supplementary, not replacement for human interaction)

# Reference Materials

**WordReference or similar dictionary**: For quick vocabulary lookups during reading

**Grammar** **reference book**: For targeted study of specific problem areas (not for systematic study)

# Conclusion

This methodology requires sustained time commitment: 2-3 hours daily for 12-14 months to reach B2-level proficiency. The approach is not optimized for casual learning or minimal time investment. It is designed for learners willing to treat language acquisition as a significant project with measurable outcomes.

The method prioritizes comprehensible input and natural acquisition over explicit instruction, while incorporating strategic use of SRS for vocabulary building and systematic output practice to develop productive skills. Progress is measured through both subjective assessment (comprehension of native content) and objective benchmarking (standardized proficiency exams).

Individual results will vary based on factors including native language background, previous language learning experience, quality of study time, and consistency of practice. The hour estimates provided represent typical ranges but are not absolute requirements.

Language acquisition is a long-term process without a definitive endpoint. B2-level competency represents functional fluency but not mastery. Continued immersion and use will drive progress toward C1 and C2 levels over subsequent years.",3,1771014544.0,learnfrench,0,0.8,False

Chapter 1: OLIVE’s POV

I had three client presentations due tomorrow and a marketing strategy that was nowhere near finished, but all I could think about was Cole coming home in two weeks.

It had been two months since I’d seen him in person. Two months of video calls and texts that came later and later each night.

Grayson would tell me I was overthinking again. My stepfather had been the steady one since Mom remarried ten years ago—the kind of dad who actually showed up, who remembered what mattered.

I pulled my laptop onto the bed, staring at the half-finished campaign for Hopkins Company.

Pathetic.

I shoved the laptop aside and reached for my nightstand drawer.

The feeling of having my vibe pressed right where I needed it, imagining Cole in his blue practice jersey, hair slicked back, hands braced on the headboard above me…

Close. So close.

The door slammed open.

My mother stood in the doorway like she hadn’t just walked in on something she definitely shouldn’t have seen. When I scrambled to sit up, tangled in my sheets and trying to shove the vibe under my pillow, she smiled.

Actually smiled.

“Oh darling, I’m so sorry I interrupted. But playtime’s over.”

“God, Mom, knocking is a thing adults do.” My face was on fire. I shoved the vibe into my nightstand drawer so fast I almost broke my finger.

“Your door was wide open, Olive. Be grateful it was me and not Hunter.”

God, if my stepbrother had walked in on that I’d have to move to another state.

“Mom, stop. Please just stop talking.”

She pressed her lips together, but amusement danced in her eyes. I wanted to die right there.

Living in the renovated space above the garage was supposed to give me independence, but it didn’t stop my mother from barging in whenever she felt like it. Still, it beat paying two grand a month for some shoebox apartment in Seattle.

“We need to talk to you.” Her voice changed, got serious. “Grayson and I have some exciting news.”

Exciting news in this family usually meant something that benefited everyone except me.

“Olive Monroe, I want you downstairs in five minutes or I’m dragging you out of that bed myself.”

The second the door closed I grabbed my phone. I needed to hear Cole’s voice, needed something good to balance out whatever disaster my parents were about to drop on me.

I hit his contact. One ring. Two rings. Three.

Cole always answered. Always picked up when I called.

The screen flickered—video call accepted—and suddenly I was staring at a shaking camera propped up on something, angled weird.

I could see him.

Cole.

Not alone.

“Oh god, yes—Cole, right there—”

A woman’s voice hit me first, high-pitched and breathless. For a second my brain couldn’t process what I was seeing.

Cole on his back, head thrown against the pillow, mouth open as he groaned. A girl on top of him, blonde hair spilling down her back as she moved.

“Fuck, you feel so good—”

“Sophia—Christ, Sophia—”

His name for her. The way he said it like it was something precious. The phone jolted with every thrust.

I should’ve hung up.

Should’ve thrown my phone across the room and pretended I’d never seen this, never heard this.

I just sat there like an idiot. Frozen. Watching my boyfriend of two years moan another woman’s name.

“God, I’m close—Cole, I’m so close—”

His hands gripped her hips and pulled her down harder. That deep groan I thought he only made with me—

The phone slipped from my fingers.

It clattered onto my bed face-up. I could still hear them—the wet sounds, her moans, his name in her mouth over and over.

Two years.

Two years of standing in freezing arenas watching him play. Two years of driving three hours just to see him for a weekend. Two years of wearing his jersey like any of it mattered.

The entire time he’d been with someone else.

Someone named Sophia.

I grabbed the phone and stabbed at the screen until the call ended. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hit the right button.

Don’t cry. Don’t you dare cry over him.

But my throat was tight and my eyes were burning and I hated that I could still hear her voice in my head.

I pressed my palms against my eyes hard enough that it hurt.

He wasn’t worth it. Wasn’t worth a single tear, wasn’t worth the two years I’d given him or any of it.

But my face was already wet.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I didn’t bother fixing my hair or washing my face before heading downstairs. What was the point.

The main house smelled like coffee and whatever my mom had baked earlier that week.

The second I opened the door both my parents’ heads snapped toward me.

“I was about to come drag you out of—” Mom stopped mid-sentence. “Olive, what’s wrong?”

I tried to say something, anything, but the second she asked, it was like a dam broke inside my chest.

I sobbed, ugly and gasping.

Grayson was already moving. He crossed the room in two strides and pulled me against his chest, one hand going to my hair and the other to my back, holding me while I fell apart.

“Shh, hey, it’s okay, you’re okay.”

“I caught him cheating.” My voice sounded wrecked.

Silence.

Complete silence.

I watched Mom’s mouth fall open. Watched Grayson’s jaw get tight.

“That Buffalo pretty boy with the perfect hair?” Mom’s voice came out sharp now. Angry.

“Diane,” Grayson warned.

“You deserve better than him, Olive. You always have.”

I wanted to believe him. Right now all I could think about was Cole’s face, about the way he’d looked at me the last time and said I love you right before asking if I could pick up his dry cleaning.

“We actually had something we wanted to tell you.” Mom’s voice softened. “Hunter got the call. He’s officially playing for the Chicago Wolves.”

My stomach dropped. “He got called up?”

The promise I’d made eight months ago, ‘when you make the NHL, I’ll be front row at your first game’ crashed into the reality of Cole’s face, Cole’s team, Cole’s city.

Hunter had been there for me through everything. Every breakup, every bad day, every moment I needed someone who understood what it felt like to be the spare part in someone else’s story.

“The game is next week,” Grayson added quietly. “I know the timing is complicated.”

“Cole is on that team.” My voice cracked. “I can’t—I can’t see him right now.”

“Then don’t look at him,” Mom said sharply. “You made a promise to your brother.”

Guilt twisted in my chest because she was right. I had promised. Back when it seemed like a far-off dream, something sweet and hypothetical, we’d joked about over pizza and bad movies.

Now it was real and the timing couldn’t be worse.

“We have tickets to his first game. Exclusive access—”

“I don’t know if I can do this.”

Grayson squeezed my shoulder. “Hunter would understand if you couldn’t make it. But he really wants you there, sweetheart.”

Mom grabbed a magazine off the coffee table and dropped it into my lap. “That’s your brother right there. Front page of Sports Illustrated.”

I looked down at Hunter’s face staring back at me.

The headline read NEW BLOOD: The Wolves’ Secret Weapon.

Pride swelled in my chest despite everything. He’d worked so hard for this.

I flipped to the next page, trying to focus on anything other than the thought of seeing Cole again.

What I saw made my entire body go still.

An ad for some energy drink. But I barely registered what the product was.

The man in the photo had his shirt half-unbuttoned. Abs so defined they didn’t even look real. The energy drink tipped against his mouth, liquid spilling over his bottom lip, dripping down his jaw and his throat.

His eyes were piercing. Cold blue. Staring directly at the camera like he could see through the page.

Like he could see me.

My thighs clenched.

“Olive?”

Grayson’s voice snapped me back. I’d been staring at the photo for way too long.

“Yeah, sorry, I just—” I cleared my throat. “Who’s this guy?”

Grayson’s entire expression changed. Got dark and tight. He gripped his coffee mug hard enough I thought it might crack.

“Zane Mercer.”

The way he said the name made it sound like it physically hurt him.

“Who?”

“My nemesis.” His voice was completely flat.

“Your nemesis? What are you, a supervillain?”

“He’s the NHL’s top player,” Mom said, her voice careful now. “And he’s made Grayson’s life hell since he started coaching. That man did things that forced him to leave the game entirely.”

I’d heard stories over the years. Vague references about someone who’d ruined everything, someone powerful and untouchable who’d destroyed his coaching career. But I’d never heard an actual name.

Zane Mercer.

Top player for the Chicago Wolves.

And apparently the last person Grayson wanted me thinking about.

I stared at the photo again. At those cold blue eyes, that dangerous jaw, the body that looked like it had been carved from stone.

At least if I had to spend a week in Chicago watching my ex-boyfriend pretend I didn’t exist, there’d be something worth looking at.

I closed the magazine and stood up, tucking it under my arm before either of them could take it back.

“Fine. I’ll go to Chicago.”

Mom blinked at me. “Really?”

“Really.” I met Grayson’s eyes. “I promised Hunter I’d be there for his first game. I’m not breaking that promise because Cole turned out to be a piece of shit.”

Grayson’s expression softened. Relief mixed with something that looked like pride.

“Besides,” I added, trying to be casual even though my heart was racing, “maybe watching some hockey will help me move on.” ",1,1771014381.0,Novelnews,2,1.0,False
