1oun86q,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricians/comments/1oun86q/zero_power_on_circuit/,Zero power on circuit,"This morning I used my Keurig to make a cup of coffee. Set it up to brew in my Yeti while I went out to start my truck. Came back in and realized it didn’t have power. Fridge didn’t have power. So I have 6 receptacles (1 being a gfci for the fridge) and after running my little no contact tester to all of them and also using my Klein gfci outlet tester, I’m getting 0 power to these 6 outlets. Breaker didn’t trip. My hot stick is showing power at the breaker switch (assuming it’s the right zone everything is mislabeled some sort of way). I just replaced the gfci outlet behind the fridge and it didn’t do anything.

I’m absolutely baffled and need some advice on where and what to check next.

It’s almost as if there’s no power in between the breaker panel and this circuit/zone. ",1,1762899070.0,electricians,1,1.0,False

1oun679,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1oun679/my_girlfriend_hits_me_insults_me_and_i_cant_live/,"My girlfriend hits me, insults me, and I can’t live like this anymore.","Over the course of several months, I chose to write here every single thing that hurt me in my current relationship. I want to keep track of the things that made me stop being the person I was two years ago, the person who achieved things he would’ve never expected in the past, but who now feels like they’re not enough anymore. Stress caught up with me, the toxicity of the people around me brought me to a point where I can’t even say out loud what I feel without taking long pauses while speaking.

 

Beginning.

 

At the beginning, I was away in another country for work, I found a job where the contract was for two months. And I started talking to this girl she was 20, I was 25. We talked freely from the start, we stayed on the phone, even my roommate at the time, who I didn’t know before, liked how we were, how we behaved... we did everything, we played games together, talked about life. And the topic of me coming home kept coming up, it felt like now I had a reason to return…

 

Eventually, the people I worked for fired me, and they told me they’d buy me a plane ticket to return back to my country. Said and done. I talked to her, I told her I was coming home and she lives 25 km away from the city where I live. She kept imagining I was already there and that we were going to see each other, which I found cute.

 

The company delayed my flight by about four days, and when they finally bought the ticket, I talked to her and told her I was coming, and asked if I should land in the city where she goes to university. She said no, that it’s better we meet on a weekend. At first I found it strange she didn’t want to see me, but it was still early between us, and I said I should just get ready to see her.

 

I got on the plane, and after 2 hours without signal, thinking about her, I landed back home. First thing I did, I texted her that I arrived… What do I see on her Instagram? She posted on her story that she’s at a picnic with a guy. I was devastated… something in me broke.

 

I analyzed the picture they had food, wine, and it was just the two of them. Instantly I unfollowed her, deleted the message where I told her “I arrived”, and went on with my life. For many days I was sad, I was thinking about her, and I told myself it's better to focus on myself.

 

5 months later, while I was studying to get my driver’s license, I see she messages me. I replied. We talked and that day we talked for 12 hours straight. I remember going to bed at 4 in the morning when I hung up. I really missed talking to her, but in my mind I still had that thought that she was with that guy at that picnic, so I got the courage in the days that followed and I asked her what happened with that guy.

 

She told me he was just a friend and that he had a girlfriend… I felt like shit, honestly, because I acted wrong by unfollowing her, and now we could’ve been celebrating 5 months together, 5-month anniversary.

 

We chose to meet she came with another friend of hers to my place to watch a movie, and it was really nice, I felt great, and the next day, we were together.

 

What sucks about me is that I’m a jealous type, and I wanted to protect what I had, not because I didn’t trust her I really did but because I didn’t want someone more interesting to appear and put me second. And while I was getting ready to go to a wedding, something didn’t add up about that guy she went to the picnic with… why the wine?

 

I gathered courage and I asked her:

“Tell me honestly, was there really something between you and that guy?”

 

And she admitted she went on a date with him. More than that… she stayed at his place that night. And from what she told me, they didn’t have sex, he just tried to kiss her and she went to sleep, in the same bed as him. I felt devastated. Not only because it was worse than I thought I imagined she went home after the picnic but she went to his place. And now? She lied.

 

She told me after she saw I unfollowed her, she got into a relationship with that guy, but he wasn’t really into her, he only called her to have sex and then looked for reasons to send her away. She told me all of this in a way where it seemed like she didn't care. Which kinda helped me get over it faster the lie, the betrayal, the humiliation.

 

I asked her when their relationship ended, and she told me May 2023, when that guy left with Work and Travel. I quickly did the math it took her 3 months to message me, so it wasn’t something serious. I talked to her more and she told me he was the second guy she slept with, so it wasn’t that important.

 

One night when she was at my place we had this thing, after 2 AM we would lie in bed and talk about deep things, we called them “serious discussions”, and sometimes they’d last 3 hours talking about what we feel, it was beautiful, we both opened up. But it still felt like she was hiding something. For me, there was still the thought that she had sex with him that night. Even today if I ask, she either gets angry that I bring it up or denies it.

 

But I found out later, looking through her messages, because she hadn’t even blocked him at that time, she still followed him. Only when I brought it up she blocked him and sent him a message like “you used me blah blah”. Because that guy used her, then got a girlfriend and became serious with her, posting pictures, and I knew she was upset about that.

 

And while looking through her conversations again I’m not proud of what I did out of desperation because something inside me was boiling thinking she was lying again, and she avoided closing that chapter I found out she waited for him up until a week before messaging me. That guy started posting pictures with his new girlfriend then, and that bothered her.

 

The fact that she hid these things and lied to my face hurts me badly. It still hurts, even now, after more than a year. Continuing, I listened to a voice message she sent her friend back then where she said that after she returns from the seaside, she wants to go see him because “she misses her boyfriend” and she told him she wanted to go to his place and stay in some hammock he had. It looked like she cared about him, like she didn’t realize he was just using her, or she knew but didn’t care.

 

She even lied to me saying I was the first boyfriend her mom knew about, but she told her mom about that guy too, she just didn’t tell her he played her.

 

What’s different between him and me is that I didn’t use her, I actually wanted something serious with her, and look, we’re still together. But what hurts is knowing I was the backup plan. If I hadn’t unfollowed her then, maybe she would’ve seen me too and lied saying he was just a friend. Who knows.

 

Anyway, after she blocked him, we fought a few times about this, and with time I forgot. The next thing related to another guy happened when she was with her faculty group on a university trip called “Sport” as they call it, and she was supposed to come to me. I was cleaning my closet while talking to her on the phone and I joked:

 

“So, did any guy hit on you there? You can tell me, I won’t get mad.”

 

It was super random, and she told me she talked to a guy and followed him. That made me feel weird, with many thoughts: “If I didn’t ask, would she have told me?”, “Did they just talk?”, “Did she have fun with him or what happened?” I hate that my jealousy makes me think these things, but from my experience, when someone lies to you once, you should expect the worst.

 

Eventually, she unfollowed that guy only because I kept insisting. I don’t think it's right to forbid someone from talking to the opposite sex when they're in a relationship, but at least out of respect for me, tell me before I find out. Because I show interest and effort for her, and I expect security, to be heard, and for her to show me I’m just stupid for thinking bad things, that everything is in my head and I should trust her. Since then, truthfully, no other guys appeared, she distanced from her friends when she saw they were fake and only used her for homework and copying. Because she studies and puts effort, even though now she uses AI for everything, no matter how small it is.

After 9 months of relationship, we had a really bad fight. I had just opened my business, and I had it in my schedule that I don’t work on Sundays. And I was supposed to go to her place, to a barbecue organized by her father, but I stopped at my business to help a client and make some quick money. She exploded:  
“How could you go to the shop? You were supposed to come straight here, forget it, don’t come, I don’t want you here.”

I went home and we argued over messages. And I did something I’m not proud of, something from the lowest level. I packed her clothes she had at my place, put them in a bag, and brought them to her house. When she came down and came to pick them up, and I saw the indifference she had, I felt hurt. I instantly regretted it, but because of pride, I avoided telling her how I felt and I left. Later, I started regretting it and told her I was sorry and that I was coming with a friend to apologize.

She told me literally two minutes before I arrived that it was too late. When I saw that message, something inside me broke. I asked her to come out to the gate so we could talk she did, but at the same time her grandmother came out, and she humiliated me. She told me that her granddaughter is too good for me and that I should look for someone my age, even though the difference between us is 5 years, which I don’t think is that big. And I knew that her mother and now apparently her grandmother are against me.

They have a small-town mentality, and her mother was worried she might get pregnant or drop out of college because of me. But those things come down to the education she gave her. In the end, I left, and she told my friend who drove me there, “hey, we’ll stay friends.”

I stayed two days without talking to her, and I chose then, from pain, to do something terrible again I tried to kill myself. Which shows that I was weak and worthless. She found out from my friend who took me there, and she called me.

She kept me on the phone so I wouldn’t do it, and I explained that lately my behavior was because of the business, that it wasn’t going well and I didn’t want to go bankrupt after investing time and money, that I started having health problems gastritis because I wasn’t eating and I was staying all day at the shop trying to make it work… And slowly we got past that. For a while we saw each other in secret because her mom forbade her to talk to me and threw harsh words:

“Good thing you got rid of him,”  
“I wonder how he feels knowing he’s not welcome in this family,”  
“If I catch you talking to him again…”

Even if you don’t agree with your daughter’s relationship, you don’t behave like that. That’s totally wrong, because she didn’t know how many things I was doing for her, how much interest I put into being by her side when others left, even if I was jealous that she might find someone else there in that big city. Because it’s a big city, anything can happen. And yes, my jealousy and insecurity led to arguments. We worked together and I got rid of the jealousy and started trusting her.

I feel more and more used, unappreciated and honestly… kind of alone in this relationship. In the beginning I was attentive, I made sacrifices, I offered to drive her anywhere she needed, to be there for her, to help her with anything. My Sundays turned into five-hour round trips just so she could get to university. Money wasn’t a question, I never complained, I did it with love. But now I feel like she doesn’t see any of that. Worse, I feel like she’s starting to treat me badly, as if everything I do is normal and expected, and I’m obligated to be her driver without the right to say “no.”

Every time I try to relax, she messages me complaining that she’s bored. When I suggested she study for her thesis, she got upset, like I did something wrong. She cares more about being with me than preparing for something important. But she also gets mad if I’m not available 100% when she wants me. I’ve reached a point where I feel guilty for taking even one hour for myself.

What hurt me most was my birthday. I organized a barbecue with friends, everyone brought something symbolic, or at least grabbed a coffee with me afterwards. She… nothing. Not even a small gesture. The excuse was that she didn’t have time, that she didn’t want to buy me something useless. But the truth is, she had time, and a month before we were literally talking about my birthday. She didn’t care. And that hurts the most that at least on my birthday, I wanted to feel like I mattered to her.

She started getting upset over anything, staying angry and making me feel like I’m always the problem.

Mornings were the coldest, evenings when I was upset and I said I’d sleep in another room but all I really waited for was for her to come and tell me to come to bed, not to stay alone and sad, like she did before. She started insulting me, commenting on how I drive, even though she couldn't even pass her driver's license exam. And what annoys me the most is how she remembers all my mistakes and throws them in my face when we argue. When I tell her I feel used, she says I shouldn’t complain, that I wanted to do all I do for her. But she never admits she’s wrong or that she hurt me.

On her graduation ceremony day, I woke up early, drove her there so she’d be on time, even though I didn’t have money on me. Then she reproached me for not getting her flowers, saying I should’ve known. And when her mom gave her 100 lei for fuel, she kept the money and didn’t tell me. It wasn’t about the money, it was the feeling that I don’t matter, like everything I do has no value.

I made a dumb joke about her uncles one took the other to Turkey for surgery. I forgot that he took 10 days off for that, she told me 6 months ago and I forgot. When I said maybe he went to Turkey to get implants… she insulted me personally, saying I'm undeveloped and already balding, and shouldn’t comment. The thing is, I wasn’t talking about the sick uncle, but the other one she herself called a piece of shit.

I stayed silent the whole way. And 30 minutes later, she starts begging me to speak. She always does this she hurts me and then tries to pull me right back as if nothing happened.

More and more I wonder… when she finishes her degree and I don’t drive her to university anymore, will she stay with me? Or will everything end because I’m no longer useful? Because that’s how I feel now. Not loved, but used. And it hurts that instead of having a relationship where we support each other, I end up feeling more alone than if I were actually alone.

As I write this, we’re still together and she’s angry because, after so long, I finally went out with some friends something she kept begging me to do. I’m not saying she doesn’t care about me at all, but I want respect. And when I bring up the sacrifices I made, frustration speaking, she says I shouldn’t “throw it in her face” that I drive her, that I offered… but all I want is a little respect.

One thing I hate about her is that she reproaches me saying I should be grateful she chooses to stay at my place instead of going home. Truth is, when she’s home we fight the most, because she gets bored. Now she’s in a better relationship with her mom, but she once made a “joke” that hurt me she implied she should move to another city and find another boyfriend, and I should stay in my town and find another girlfriend. Considering what we’ve been through things her mom doesn’t even know she should’ve defended me when we talked about it, but instead she said “come on, she was joking.” But when I joke, she treats me with coldness and gets upset. With me she allows herself to do a lot, but not with others.

**Last update, because I feel like we are approaching the end.**

It already started getting worse. After she finished university, she went through a period where her happiness completely faded. For more than 4 months now, she began isolating herself, and it has become very difficult for me to get her out of the house. She no longer stays at my place, mostly only on weekends, and she blames my business, saying it holds me back and that I need to be there. She doesn’t like staying at my place because it's messy. I don’t ask her to clean, I don’t ask her to wash my dishes or cook. When she feels like it, she does those things by herself. But when she’s at my place and I go near the dishes, she tells me that she’ll wash them, because I’m not capable of doing it.

She started again with the old story that I like girls' stories on Instagram. But I do it because I know them, they liked my story too, they know I have a girlfriend because my profile picture is with us. She started threatening me and sending messages like:  
“Now I can accuse you of lying to me too :) And trust me, if I ever find out you're cheating or whatever, it won’t be the end, so you can’t really hurt me if that's what you want, since I know you’re very revengeful.”

I don’t even know what she was trying to insinuate. Yes, I’m an idiot when I’m angry and I get upset fast, I’m proud… But with her, I’m not as proud I start feeling guilty if I did something that upset her. I had a rough period in the past and I'm slowly recovering, maturing slower because I went through everything. I went from being someone who used to receive lots of invitations to go out, to someone who doesn’t have the energy or desire to go anywhere. It hurts me that I isolated myself too, just like she did.

Continuing after she finished college, she had time to calm down. Now she’s looking for a job, and it’s hard to find one because she has no experience and the job market is chaotic. Meanwhile, her mother started accepting me, we even talk now, and I was invited and went to two weddings with her family. Sometimes I feel closer to her family than to her.

I keep thinking about how happy we both used to be, and how patient she was with me at the beginning of the relationship. We talked for hours, and now if I say something wrong or raise my voice because she’s picking on me, she hangs up, ignores me for hours or even days, and it feels like she has someone else and wants me to end the relationship but I don’t think that’s the case. I hope not.

I feel sorry for her jealousy I used to do the same things too, and now it feels like we switched personalities… At night she starts arguments over nothing and then says she's just tired. What annoys me the most is when I speak to her and she doesn’t even bother answering. Sometimes when she was at my place, she would literally get dressed and leave. She would say she’s going to the bus and going home, because she can’t stand the way I behave with her.

She constantly says I save pictures of girls, that I watch porn, that I'm disgusting and that other girls wouldn't even look at me, that I’m 5 years older than her and I don’t have a stable future. And when I try to earn money honestly, she says it’s pointless, that I waste money on stupid things, and that I’ll never get anywhere, that she has higher studies than me. She makes me feel inferior. I started smoking more, feeling more stressed than before.

Even with my own business I wasn’t as stressed as I am now. But it started affecting me there too… I don’t want to talk to people anymore, because when I hear a notification from her, my instinct tells me: “finish the conversation fast, if you don’t reply she’ll get upset.” And sometimes I see her message and forget to reply, or I don’t know what to say, I can’t even choose my words without fear she will block me.

I'm ashamed to talk to my friends about how I feel. I started thinking like she does “you don’t have anyone to talk to, they don’t care.” She told me that before, and I noticed that some friends only came when they were bored, or that when I invited them to parties, afterwards they would go to someone else’s. I’m not saying she’s completely wrong, but not totally right either. Maybe that’s why I'm scared of losing her because aside from everything I said about her, which some of it is influenced by anger and from my perspective only I can also be wrong, because I’m human. But everything I write here is what I feel. And I’m afraid to show her, I’m afraid to talk about certain topics because I know she won’t understand and it will start an argument.

She is selfish regarding herself, just like I am selfish now by saying all of this about her. But I’d never hit her. She has done that multiple times. I kept all these things inside because they didn’t repeat frequently, but I hate the fact that anything I do annoys her, anything I am disgusts her.

She always tells me she sees potential in me, but at the same time she insults me and treats me however she wants. And I swear, if I tell her even one thing from what I wrote here, she will block me everywhere.",1,1762898943.0,confessions,0,1.0,False

- perfume, I'm sensitive to certain smells so only like what I like. 
- stationery , basically don't need much with age so don't find them useful unless there's a need
- chocolate and flowers ? Don't like them 

- books and music, doesn't interest me but I can see how it's others hobbies so understand why others would want this.
- clothes, I know my style and needs and I don't like unnecc clothes.

I analyzed the picture they had food, wine, and it was just the two of them. Instantly I unfollowed her, deleted the message where I told her “I arrived”, and went on with my life. For many days I was sad, I was thinking about her, and I told myself it's better to focus on myself.

 

5 months later, while I was studying to get my driver’s license, I see she messages me. I replied. We talked and that day we talked for 12 hours straight. I remember going to bed at 4 in the morning when I hung up. I really missed talking to her, but in my mind I still had that thought that she was with that guy at that picnic, so I got the courage in the days that followed and I asked her what happened with that guy.

 

She told me he was just a friend and that he had a girlfriend… I felt like shit, honestly, because I acted wrong by unfollowing her, and now we could’ve been celebrating 5 months together, 5-month anniversary.

 

We chose to meet she came with another friend of hers to my place to watch a movie, and it was really nice, I felt great, and the next day, we were together.

 

What sucks about me is that I’m a jealous type, and I wanted to protect what I had, not because I didn’t trust her I really did but because I didn’t want someone more interesting to appear and put me second. And while I was getting ready to go to a wedding, something didn’t add up about that guy she went to the picnic with… why the wine?

 

I gathered courage and I asked her:

“Tell me honestly, was there really something between you and that guy?”

 

And she admitted she went on a date with him. More than that… she stayed at his place that night. And from what she told me, they didn’t have sex, he just tried to kiss her and she went to sleep, in the same bed as him. I felt devastated. Not only because it was worse than I thought I imagined she went home after the picnic but she went to his place. And now? She lied.

 

She told me after she saw I unfollowed her, she got into a relationship with that guy, but he wasn’t really into her, he only called her to have sex and then looked for reasons to send her away. She told me all of this in a way where it seemed like she didn't care. Which kinda helped me get over it faster the lie, the betrayal, the humiliation.

 

I asked her when their relationship ended, and she told me May 2023, when that guy left with Work and Travel. I quickly did the math it took her 3 months to message me, so it wasn’t something serious. I talked to her more and she told me he was the second guy she slept with, so it wasn’t that important.

 

One night when she was at my place we had this thing, after 2 AM we would lie in bed and talk about deep things, we called them “serious discussions”, and sometimes they’d last 3 hours talking about what we feel, it was beautiful, we both opened up. But it still felt like she was hiding something. For me, there was still the thought that she had sex with him that night. Even today if I ask, she either gets angry that I bring it up or denies it.

 

But I found out later, looking through her messages, because she hadn’t even blocked him at that time, she still followed him. Only when I brought it up she blocked him and sent him a message like “you used me blah blah”. Because that guy used her, then got a girlfriend and became serious with her, posting pictures, and I knew she was upset about that.

 

And while looking through her conversations again I’m not proud of what I did out of desperation because something inside me was boiling thinking she was lying again, and she avoided closing that chapter I found out she waited for him up until a week before messaging me. That guy started posting pictures with his new girlfriend then, and that bothered her.

 

The fact that she hid these things and lied to my face hurts me badly. It still hurts, even now, after more than a year. Continuing, I listened to a voice message she sent her friend back then where she said that after she returns from the seaside, she wants to go see him because “she misses her boyfriend” and she told him she wanted to go to his place and stay in some hammock he had. It looked like she cared about him, like she didn’t realize he was just using her, or she knew but didn’t care.

 

She even lied to me saying I was the first boyfriend her mom knew about, but she told her mom about that guy too, she just didn’t tell her he played her.

 

What’s different between him and me is that I didn’t use her, I actually wanted something serious with her, and look, we’re still together. But what hurts is knowing I was the backup plan. If I hadn’t unfollowed her then, maybe she would’ve seen me too and lied saying he was just a friend. Who knows.

 

Anyway, after she blocked him, we fought a few times about this, and with time I forgot. The next thing related to another guy happened when she was with her faculty group on a university trip called “Sport” as they call it, and she was supposed to come to me. I was cleaning my closet while talking to her on the phone and I joked:

 

“So, did any guy hit on you there? You can tell me, I won’t get mad.”

 

It was super random, and she told me she talked to a guy and followed him. That made me feel weird, with many thoughts: “If I didn’t ask, would she have told me?”, “Did they just talk?”, “Did she have fun with him or what happened?” I hate that my jealousy makes me think these things, but from my experience, when someone lies to you once, you should expect the worst.

 

Eventually, she unfollowed that guy only because I kept insisting. I don’t think it's right to forbid someone from talking to the opposite sex when they're in a relationship, but at least out of respect for me, tell me before I find out. Because I show interest and effort for her, and I expect security, to be heard, and for her to show me I’m just stupid for thinking bad things, that everything is in my head and I should trust her. Since then, truthfully, no other guys appeared, she distanced from her friends when she saw they were fake and only used her for homework and copying. Because she studies and puts effort, even though now she uses AI for everything, no matter how small it is.

After 9 months of relationship, we had a really bad fight. I had just opened my business, and I had it in my schedule that I don’t work on Sundays. And I was supposed to go to her place, to a barbecue organized by her father, but I stopped at my business to help a client and make some quick money. She exploded:  
“How could you go to the shop? You were supposed to come straight here, forget it, don’t come, I don’t want you here.”

I went home and we argued over messages. And I did something I’m not proud of, something from the lowest level. I packed her clothes she had at my place, put them in a bag, and brought them to her house. When she came down and came to pick them up, and I saw the indifference she had, I felt hurt. I instantly regretted it, but because of pride, I avoided telling her how I felt and I left. Later, I started regretting it and told her I was sorry and that I was coming with a friend to apologize.

She told me literally two minutes before I arrived that it was too late. When I saw that message, something inside me broke. I asked her to come out to the gate so we could talk she did, but at the same time her grandmother came out, and she humiliated me. She told me that her granddaughter is too good for me and that I should look for someone my age, even though the difference between us is 5 years, which I don’t think is that big. And I knew that her mother and now apparently her grandmother are against me.

They have a small-town mentality, and her mother was worried she might get pregnant or drop out of college because of me. But those things come down to the education she gave her. In the end, I left, and she told my friend who drove me there, “hey, we’ll stay friends.”

I stayed two days without talking to her, and I chose then, from pain, to do something terrible again I tried to kill myself. Which shows that I was weak and worthless. She found out from my friend who took me there, and she called me.

She kept me on the phone so I wouldn’t do it, and I explained that lately my behavior was because of the business, that it wasn’t going well and I didn’t want to go bankrupt after investing time and money, that I started having health problems gastritis because I wasn’t eating and I was staying all day at the shop trying to make it work… And slowly we got past that. For a while we saw each other in secret because her mom forbade her to talk to me and threw harsh words:

“Good thing you got rid of him,”  
“I wonder how he feels knowing he’s not welcome in this family,”  
“If I catch you talking to him again…”

Even if you don’t agree with your daughter’s relationship, you don’t behave like that. That’s totally wrong, because she didn’t know how many things I was doing for her, how much interest I put into being by her side when others left, even if I was jealous that she might find someone else there in that big city. Because it’s a big city, anything can happen. And yes, my jealousy and insecurity led to arguments. We worked together and I got rid of the jealousy and started trusting her.

I feel more and more used, unappreciated and honestly… kind of alone in this relationship. In the beginning I was attentive, I made sacrifices, I offered to drive her anywhere she needed, to be there for her, to help her with anything. My Sundays turned into five-hour round trips just so she could get to university. Money wasn’t a question, I never complained, I did it with love. But now I feel like she doesn’t see any of that. Worse, I feel like she’s starting to treat me badly, as if everything I do is normal and expected, and I’m obligated to be her driver without the right to say “no.”

Every time I try to relax, she messages me complaining that she’s bored. When I suggested she study for her thesis, she got upset, like I did something wrong. She cares more about being with me than preparing for something important. But she also gets mad if I’m not available 100% when she wants me. I’ve reached a point where I feel guilty for taking even one hour for myself.

What hurt me most was my birthday. I organized a barbecue with friends, everyone brought something symbolic, or at least grabbed a coffee with me afterwards. She… nothing. Not even a small gesture. The excuse was that she didn’t have time, that she didn’t want to buy me something useless. But the truth is, she had time, and a month before we were literally talking about my birthday. She didn’t care. And that hurts the most that at least on my birthday, I wanted to feel like I mattered to her.

She started getting upset over anything, staying angry and making me feel like I’m always the problem.

Mornings were the coldest, evenings when I was upset and I said I’d sleep in another room but all I really waited for was for her to come and tell me to come to bed, not to stay alone and sad, like she did before. She started insulting me, commenting on how I drive, even though she couldn't even pass her driver's license exam. And what annoys me the most is how she remembers all my mistakes and throws them in my face when we argue. When I tell her I feel used, she says I shouldn’t complain, that I wanted to do all I do for her. But she never admits she’s wrong or that she hurt me.

On her graduation ceremony day, I woke up early, drove her there so she’d be on time, even though I didn’t have money on me. Then she reproached me for not getting her flowers, saying I should’ve known. And when her mom gave her 100 lei for fuel, she kept the money and didn’t tell me. It wasn’t about the money, it was the feeling that I don’t matter, like everything I do has no value.

I made a dumb joke about her uncles one took the other to Turkey for surgery. I forgot that he took 10 days off for that, she told me 6 months ago and I forgot. When I said maybe he went to Turkey to get implants… she insulted me personally, saying I'm undeveloped and already balding, and shouldn’t comment. The thing is, I wasn’t talking about the sick uncle, but the other one she herself called a piece of shit.

I stayed silent the whole way. And 30 minutes later, she starts begging me to speak. She always does this she hurts me and then tries to pull me right back as if nothing happened.

More and more I wonder… when she finishes her degree and I don’t drive her to university anymore, will she stay with me? Or will everything end because I’m no longer useful? Because that’s how I feel now. Not loved, but used. And it hurts that instead of having a relationship where we support each other, I end up feeling more alone than if I were actually alone.

As I write this, we’re still together and she’s angry because, after so long, I finally went out with some friends something she kept begging me to do. I’m not saying she doesn’t care about me at all, but I want respect. And when I bring up the sacrifices I made, frustration speaking, she says I shouldn’t “throw it in her face” that I drive her, that I offered… but all I want is a little respect.

One thing I hate about her is that she reproaches me saying I should be grateful she chooses to stay at my place instead of going home. Truth is, when she’s home we fight the most, because she gets bored. Now she’s in a better relationship with her mom, but she once made a “joke” that hurt me she implied she should move to another city and find another boyfriend, and I should stay in my town and find another girlfriend. Considering what we’ve been through things her mom doesn’t even know she should’ve defended me when we talked about it, but instead she said “come on, she was joking.” But when I joke, she treats me with coldness and gets upset. With me she allows herself to do a lot, but not with others.

**Last update, because I feel like we are approaching the end.**

It already started getting worse. After she finished university, she went through a period where her happiness completely faded. For more than 4 months now, she began isolating herself, and it has become very difficult for me to get her out of the house. She no longer stays at my place, mostly only on weekends, and she blames my business, saying it holds me back and that I need to be there. She doesn’t like staying at my place because it's messy. I don’t ask her to clean, I don’t ask her to wash my dishes or cook. When she feels like it, she does those things by herself. But when she’s at my place and I go near the dishes, she tells me that she’ll wash them, because I’m not capable of doing it.

She started again with the old story that I like girls' stories on Instagram. But I do it because I know them, they liked my story too, they know I have a girlfriend because my profile picture is with us. She started threatening me and sending messages like:  
“Now I can accuse you of lying to me too :) And trust me, if I ever find out you're cheating or whatever, it won’t be the end, so you can’t really hurt me if that's what you want, since I know you’re very revengeful.”

I don’t even know what she was trying to insinuate. Yes, I’m an idiot when I’m angry and I get upset fast, I’m proud… But with her, I’m not as proud I start feeling guilty if I did something that upset her. I had a rough period in the past and I'm slowly recovering, maturing slower because I went through everything. I went from being someone who used to receive lots of invitations to go out, to someone who doesn’t have the energy or desire to go anywhere. It hurts me that I isolated myself too, just like she did.

Continuing after she finished college, she had time to calm down. Now she’s looking for a job, and it’s hard to find one because she has no experience and the job market is chaotic. Meanwhile, her mother started accepting me, we even talk now, and I was invited and went to two weddings with her family. Sometimes I feel closer to her family than to her.

I keep thinking about how happy we both used to be, and how patient she was with me at the beginning of the relationship. We talked for hours, and now if I say something wrong or raise my voice because she’s picking on me, she hangs up, ignores me for hours or even days, and it feels like she has someone else and wants me to end the relationship but I don’t think that’s the case. I hope not.

I feel sorry for her jealousy I used to do the same things too, and now it feels like we switched personalities… At night she starts arguments over nothing and then says she's just tired. What annoys me the most is when I speak to her and she doesn’t even bother answering. Sometimes when she was at my place, she would literally get dressed and leave. She would say she’s going to the bus and going home, because she can’t stand the way I behave with her.

She constantly says I save pictures of girls, that I watch porn, that I'm disgusting and that other girls wouldn't even look at me, that I’m 5 years older than her and I don’t have a stable future. And when I try to earn money honestly, she says it’s pointless, that I waste money on stupid things, and that I’ll never get anywhere, that she has higher studies than me. She makes me feel inferior. I started smoking more, feeling more stressed than before.

Even with my own business I wasn’t as stressed as I am now. But it started affecting me there too… I don’t want to talk to people anymore, because when I hear a notification from her, my instinct tells me: “finish the conversation fast, if you don’t reply she’ll get upset.” And sometimes I see her message and forget to reply, or I don’t know what to say, I can’t even choose my words without fear she will block me.

I'm ashamed to talk to my friends about how I feel. I started thinking like she does “you don’t have anyone to talk to, they don’t care.” She told me that before, and I noticed that some friends only came when they were bored, or that when I invited them to parties, afterwards they would go to someone else’s. I’m not saying she’s completely wrong, but not totally right either. Maybe that’s why I'm scared of losing her because aside from everything I said about her, which some of it is influenced by anger and from my perspective only I can also be wrong, because I’m human. But everything I write here is what I feel. And I’m afraid to show her, I’m afraid to talk about certain topics because I know she won’t understand and it will start an argument.

She is selfish regarding herself, just like I am selfish now by saying all of this about her. But I’d never hit her. She has done that multiple times. I kept all these things inside because they didn’t repeat frequently, but I hate the fact that anything I do annoys her, anything I am disgusts her.

She always tells me she sees potential in me, but at the same time she insults me and treats me however she wants. And I swear, if I tell her even one thing from what I wrote here, she will block me everywhere.",0,1762898788.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

Over the course of several months, I chose to write here every single thing that hurt me in my current relationship. I want to keep track of the things that made me stop being the person I was two years ago, the person who achieved things he would’ve never expected in the past, but who now feels like they’re not enough anymore. Stress caught up with me, the toxicity of the people around me brought me to a point where I can’t even say out loud what I feel without taking long pauses while speaking.

 

Beginning.

 

At the beginning, I was away in another country for work, I found a job where the contract was for two months. And I started talking to this girl she was 20, I was 25. We talked freely from the start, we stayed on the phone, even my roommate at the time, who I didn’t know before, liked how we were, how we behaved... we did everything, we played games together, talked about life. And the topic of me coming home kept coming up, it felt like now I had a reason to return…

 

Eventually, the people I worked for fired me, and they told me they’d buy me a plane ticket to return back to my country. Said and done. I talked to her, I told her I was coming home and she lives 25 km away from the city where I live. She kept imagining I was already there and that we were going to see each other, which I found cute.

 

The company delayed my flight by about four days, and when they finally bought the ticket, I talked to her and told her I was coming, and asked if I should land in the city where she goes to university. She said no, that it’s better we meet on a weekend. At first I found it strange she didn’t want to see me, but it was still early between us, and I said I should just get ready to see her.

 

I got on the plane, and after 2 hours without signal, thinking about her, I landed back home. First thing I did, I texted her that I arrived… What do I see on her Instagram? She posted on her story that she’s at a picnic with a guy. I was devastated… something in me broke.

And while I was getting ready to go to a wedding, something didn’t add up about that guy she went to the picnic with… why the wine?

 

I gathered courage and I asked her:

And she admitted she went on a date with him. More than that… she stayed at his place that night.

Not only because it was worse than I thought I imagined she went home after the picnic but she went to his place. And now? She lied.

 

She told me after she saw I unfollowed her, she got into a relationship with that guy, but he wasn’t really into her, he only called her to have sex and then looked for reasons to send her away. She told me all of this in a way where it seemed like she didn't care. Which kinda helped me get over it faster the lie, the betrayal, the humiliation.

“If I catch you talking to him again…”

Even if you don’t agree with your daughter’s relationship, you don’t behave like that. That’s totally wrong, because she didn’t know how many things I was doing for her, how much interest I put into being by her side when others left, even if I was jealous that she might find someone else there in that big city. Because it’s a big city, anything can happen. And yes, my jealousy and insecurity led to arguments. We worked together and I got rid of the jealousy and started trusting her.

I feel more and more used, unappreciated and honestly… kind of alone in this relationship. In the beginning I was attentive, I made sacrifices, I offered to drive her anywhere she needed, to be there for her, to help her with anything. My Sundays turned into five-hour round trips just so she could get to university. Money wasn’t a question, I never complained, I did it with love. But now I feel like she doesn’t see any of that. Worse, I feel like she’s starting to treat me badly, as if everything I do is normal and expected, and I’m obligated to be her driver without the right to say “no.”

Every time I try to relax, she messages me complaining that she’s bored. When I suggested she study for her thesis, she got upset, like I did something wrong. She cares more about being with me than preparing for something important. But she also gets mad if I’m not available 100% when she wants me. I’ve reached a point where I feel guilty for taking even one hour for myself.

What hurt me most was my birthday. I organized a barbecue with friends, everyone brought something symbolic, or at least grabbed a coffee with me afterwards. She… nothing. Not even a small gesture. The excuse was that she didn’t have time, that she didn’t want to buy me something useless. But the truth is, she had time, and a month before we were literally talking about my birthday. She didn’t care. And that hurts the most that at least on my birthday, I wanted to feel like I mattered to her.

She started getting upset over anything, staying angry and making me feel like I’m always the problem.

Mornings were the coldest, evenings when I was upset and I said I’d sleep in another room but all I really waited for was for her to come and tell me to come to bed, not to stay alone and sad, like she did before. She started insulting me, commenting on how I drive, even though she couldn't even pass her driver's license exam. And what annoys me the most is how she remembers all my mistakes and throws them in my face when we argue. When I tell her I feel used, she says I shouldn’t complain, that I wanted to do all I do for her. But she never admits she’s wrong or that she hurt me.

On her graduation ceremony day, I woke up early, drove her there so she’d be on time, even though I didn’t have money on me. Then she reproached me for not getting her flowers, saying I should’ve known. And when her mom gave her 100 lei for fuel, she kept the money and didn’t tell me. It wasn’t about the money, it was the feeling that I don’t matter, like everything I do has no value.

I made a dumb joke about her uncles one took the other to Turkey for surgery. I forgot that he took 10 days off for that, she told me 6 months ago and I forgot. When I said maybe he went to Turkey to get implants… she insulted me personally, saying I'm undeveloped and already balding, and shouldn’t comment. The thing is, I wasn’t talking about the sick uncle, but the other one she herself called a piece of shit.

I stayed silent the whole way. And 30 minutes later, she starts begging me to speak. She always does this she hurts me and then tries to pull me right back as if nothing happened.

More and more I wonder… when she finishes her degree and I don’t drive her to university anymore, will she stay with me? Or will everything end because I’m no longer useful? Because that’s how I feel now. Not loved, but used. And it hurts that instead of having a relationship where we support each other, I end up feeling more alone than if I were actually alone.

As I write this, we’re still together and she’s angry because, after so long, I finally went out with some friends something she kept begging me to do. I’m not saying she doesn’t care about me at all, but I want respect. And when I bring up the sacrifices I made, frustration speaking, she says I shouldn’t “throw it in her face” that I drive her, that I offered… but all I want is a little respect.

One thing I hate about her is that she reproaches me saying I should be grateful she chooses to stay at my place instead of going home. Truth is, when she’s home we fight the most, because she gets bored. Now she’s in a better relationship with her mom, but she once made a “joke” that hurt me she implied she should move to another city and find another boyfriend, and I should stay in my town and find another girlfriend. Considering what we’ve been through things her mom doesn’t even know she should’ve defended me when we talked about it, but instead she said “come on, she was joking.” But when I joke, she treats me with coldness and gets upset. With me she allows herself to do a lot, but not with others.

**Last update, because I feel like we are approaching the end.**

It already started getting worse. After she finished university, she went through a period where her happiness completely faded. For more than 4 months now, she began isolating herself, and it has become very difficult for me to get her out of the house. She no longer stays at my place, mostly only on weekends, and she blames my business, saying it holds me back and that I need to be there. She doesn’t like staying at my place because it's messy. I don’t ask her to clean, I don’t ask her to wash my dishes or cook. When she feels like it, she does those things by herself. But when she’s at my place and I go near the dishes, she tells me that she’ll wash them, because I’m not capable of doing it.

She started again with the old story that I like girls' stories on Instagram. But I do it because I know them, they liked my story too, they know I have a girlfriend because my profile picture is with us. She started threatening me and sending messages like:  
“Now I can accuse you of lying to me too :) And trust me, if I ever find out you're cheating or whatever, it won’t be the end, so you can’t really hurt me if that's what you want, since I know you’re very revengeful.”

I don’t even know what she was trying to insinuate. Yes, I’m an idiot when I’m angry and I get upset fast, I’m proud… But with her, I’m not as proud I start feeling guilty if I did something that upset her. I had a rough period in the past and I'm slowly recovering, maturing slower because I went through everything. I went from being someone who used to receive lots of invitations to go out, to someone who doesn’t have the energy or desire to go anywhere. It hurts me that I isolated myself too, just like she did.

Continuing after she finished college, she had time to calm down. Now she’s looking for a job, and it’s hard to find one because she has no experience and the job market is chaotic. Meanwhile, her mother started accepting me, we even talk now, and I was invited and went to two weddings with her family. Sometimes I feel closer to her family than to her.

I keep thinking about how happy we both used to be, and how patient she was with me at the beginning of the relationship. We talked for hours, and now if I say something wrong or raise my voice because she’s picking on me, she hangs up, ignores me for hours or even days, and it feels like she has someone else and wants me to end the relationship but I don’t think that’s the case. I hope not.

I feel sorry for her jealousy I used to do the same things too, and now it feels like we switched personalities… At night she starts arguments over nothing and then says she's just tired. What annoys me the most is when I speak to her and she doesn’t even bother answering. Sometimes when she was at my place, she would literally get dressed and leave. She would say she’s going to the bus and going home, because she can’t stand the way I behave with her.

She constantly says I save pictures of girls, that I watch porn, that I'm disgusting and that other girls wouldn't even look at me, that I’m 5 years older than her and I don’t have a stable future. And when I try to earn money honestly, she says it’s pointless, that I waste money on stupid things, and that I’ll never get anywhere, that she has higher studies than me. She makes me feel inferior. I started smoking more, feeling more stressed than before.

Even with my own business I wasn’t as stressed as I am now. But it started affecting me there too… I don’t want to talk to people anymore, because when I hear a notification from her, my instinct tells me: “finish the conversation fast, if you don’t reply she’ll get upset.” And sometimes I see her message and forget to reply, or I don’t know what to say, I can’t even choose my words without fear she will block me.

I'm ashamed to talk to my friends about how I feel. I started thinking like she does “you don’t have anyone to talk to, they don’t care.” She told me that before, and I noticed that some friends only came when they were bored, or that when I invited them to parties, afterwards they would go to someone else’s. I’m not saying she’s completely wrong, but not totally right either. Maybe that’s why I'm scared of losing her because aside from everything I said about her, which some of it is influenced by anger and from my perspective only I can also be wrong, because I’m human. But everything I write here is what I feel. And I’m afraid to show her, I’m afraid to talk about certain topics because I know she won’t understand and it will start an argument.

She is selfish regarding herself, just like I am selfish now by saying all of this about her. But I’d never hit her. She has done that multiple times. I kept all these things inside because they didn’t repeat frequently, but I hate the fact that anything I do annoys her, anything I am disgusts her.

She always tells me she sees potential in me, but at the same time she insults me and treats me however she wants. And I swear, if I tell her even one thing from what I wrote here, she will block me everywhere.

* who is the correct person to speak with? Marketing manager? Brand manager? Sales people? All 3?
* what's the best approach? how would YOU reach out to a property develoepr to discuss upcoming needs for promotional content?

Day 1 - Land in San Jose and stay overnight 
Day 2 - Rent a car and drive to La Fortuna. Spend the day at the resort and hot springs
Day 3 - Mistico hanging bridges and coffee and chocolate our
Day 4 - Zip lining and Bogarin Trail
Day 5 - La Fortuna falls just from the top view point and then drive to Manuel Antonio
Day 6 - Manuel Antonio national park and beach
Day 7 - Morning is free so far. Afternoon we have a dolphin watch and snorkeling tour
Day 8 - free day so far.  Need suggestions 
Day 9 - drive back to San Jose. Need suggestions for activities in the morning before we leave Manuel Antonio or in San Jose
Day 10 - early morning flight

Im not divorced. To be honest, I dont want to. But in the end, who truly wanted that? I just need to get some things out of my chest. 
My wife is a good mother (we have 2 kids) and she always backs me up infront of toxic family members etc. But the nagging. The f.....nagging. Since 6 years I feel like, we are in a competion who does more but with me not giving a shit about it. Men and women are different and people are different. So why compare? Especialy in a marriage. Im a morning person, she isnt. I like having my peace after kids are in bed. She doesnt care. And here the story starts. We have always problems during the evening time. Mostly I put both kids to bed which includes bathing, clothing, brushing teeth etc and since my daughter is older shes 7 and my son 1 year old so for now, I dont read him books)I read her every night a book. Im a father that cant say no to his daughter. Today was like this: My wife teached my daughter how to writte some basic words and I was bathing and putting the baby to bed. When I was done, I cleaned a bit the toys and my wife came down and I asked if she or me reads my daughter a book. She told me. Fine for me. I went upstairs, brushed her teeth yada yada and we read a book and after my daughter wanted to cuddle. Again, cant say no. Since it was a long book it took time. My wife then angry with the nagging voice came up and said: ""Now its finished, come down cleaning"". I went out cause I dont make a scene infront of my kids. I got angry and told her downstairs she should  clean faster cause since years she spends every evening complaining about cleaning in the evening. Then she went on a rant about me doing nothing and playing games at nightyada yada. I told her 90% of the time I put kids to bed and she cleans. So whats the issue? (and the other 10% I clean). And I play games NEVER during the day. Always after kids sleep. Its my way of letting the steam out. God forbid a men can do that. She started to nagg and nagg and I told her to stop it. She continued her power point presentation (which I always tell her she loves this comparison ..) and I just exploded. I throw a forc to the wall and left. Drove with my car to the next gas station. Bought actualy just a cold coffee for the next morning lol. Now she is on the couch angry in the dark. Will be another nice week. As I said in the beggining, every person is different. I like to be at one point during the day done. Thats in the evening. Im very efficent during the morning and day. She is not. So why I need to do 100 things at night? I admit, I like to play games when kids sleep. She hates it while she browses instagram for 2 hours. Its not like she does something meaningful but I dont expect her to do it. We have 2 small kids, work and household, and I do all that and help. I dont drink alcohol. I dont cheat. In the past (maybe it wasnt) that was like a dream husband.

haven’t really noticed to much of a difference yet. i’m meant to stop vaping tomorrow. i did miss my meds completely the other day, and yesterday i forgot to take the 2nd one as im on zyban sr 150. still been hitting my vape all the time like usual.

on monday, i did feel really wonky though. probably due to me having a V (energy drink) in the morning, and the a coffee with 3 shots later at work. i’ve been having a v in the morning most days and have been fine, but i think the coffee really fucked me. i couldn’t focus on shit. like literally with my eyes, trying to read something hurt my brain. hella brain fog. so ya i think ill limit myself to a v and that’s it, maybe move to the smaller ones.

i cant lie i do feel a bit manicy though. i’m not sure yet. it’s usually to do with my menstrual cycle though.

i’ve been on birthcontrol since like 13, with a year off it a few years ago. lately ive been HORRIBLE with taking it. i completely forget. it may be easier now that i have a med that i certainly won’t forget in the morning. when i was on vyvanse i was ontop of taking my BC
am considering a IUD.

i’ll see how i go on, and post updates. i’m hoping to 

1. quit nicotine for good. it’s causing extreme appetite loss, and i feel so fucking weak and shitty all the time now
2. help my anxiety. i constantly am aware of how others perceive me and i hate living like this. 

3. quit bad habits. this is probably just me stimming, but like pulling out singular hairs that feel like coarser, i’ll do this while doing something and not even realize. like on autopilot?

4. libido?? i rare for me to want to have sex with my bf. i’m not sure if bupropion will help though as i think i avoid sex due to trauma. certainly need to see someone about it. i also get excruciating pain from it sometimes. trying to figure out what that is.

5. weed??? i smoke weed like daily, and honestly usually in the morning before i go to work or tafe. it’s really bad. i lowkey don’t want to quit though. i’ve always done some sort of substance. i started smoking at 13. and daily from 15 or 16 and im now 19. i use it as a coping mechanism. i’ve always really struggled to control my emotions. it’s impacted me heavily in the past, and using weed helps me regulate my emotions. idk i am just attached to weed.

6. i think there was something else that i saw bupropion could help, but i can’t remember atm ;-; if i remember ill add.

but ya! that’s how im going and what i would love to happen with bupropion and me <3

What confuses me most is the dates. I have started eating 7 dates with almonds as breakfast + 4 hours between breakfast and lunch, and never felt better in my life. Dates are supposed to be high fodmap, yet nothing works better for me than dates!

Also, oats and potato are supposed to be low fodmap. Man, that stuff destroy me. Almost like garlic, which is the item that terrifies me now! 

Eggs is also supposed to be low fodmap, but I am not sure how I feel about it. As soon as I eat them scrambled, I get the PVCs (palpitations) and noisy tummy. And when I eat them boiled, I get gerd etc. It’s sad, I love eggs, best nature’s gift, but definitely a NO for me.

Keen to hear your thoughts about best way to sell to people in this region. I (35f) work for a video production company, with offices in Dubai, KSA, Stockholm, and Sydney. We produce TV commercials, social content, and outdoor experiences. Lately I've been asked to do cold reach out to brands and creative agencies, to start a relationship with them and eventually receive a brief for a job.   
  
I'm in Australia, and how I do that here is by emailing the relevant person at the brand or agency, saying something positive and specific about the brand or agency, and asking whether they are free to meet up for a coffee to chat about content. This works fairly well here. Obviously, I won't be able to get coffee in Dubai (though we have producers who can) but I'm wondering if that's even the right approach. 

What should i be saying in my cold email? And can i keep my tone professional/casual, or should i stick to highly professional? How do people like to talk business? Straight to the point or grease them up a bt?

Any advice/resources most welcome! Even better if you're in sales or the advertising  industry in Dubai and can jump on a quick 10 mins call with me to chat about it?

One neighborhood that really stands out to me lately is **Cane Island** — just north of I-10, right by Old Katy.

It’s got this mix of resort-style living and small-town Texas charm that you don’t find just anywhere.

Here’s what I’ve noticed after spending a lot of time around the community and helping several families move there:

🏠 **Homes:** Built by Perry, Highland, David Weekley, Shea, and Trendmaker — great craftsmanship and energy-efficient designs.  
🌳 **Amenities:** Amenity Village with pool, café, yoga studio, dog park, trails, and lakes. It’s like living in a resort, but still feels like home.  
🍽️ **Local favorites nearby:** The Oaks Kitchen & Bar (inside the community), No Label Brewing, Kona Coffee, and LaCenterra.  
🚗 **Location:** Super convenient — right off I-10, close to Old Katy, and minutes from shops, restaurants, and entertainment.

I’ve always thought Cane Island has one of the best balances between luxury and livability.

For anyone already living there — what do you love most about the neighborhood?  
And if you’ve been thinking about moving — what’s one thing you’d want to know before checking it out?

**Parse the Odds**  
The Carolina Hurricanes are the clear favorites here, with odds hovering around **-172** (implied probability: \~63%) compared to Washington’s **+142** (implied: \~58%). Wait—*both* teams have over 50% implied odds? That’s the hockey version of a “both teams can win” scenario, but with fewer penalties and more face-offs. The total goals line sits at **6.5**, with the **Under** priced slightly better (1.74–1.95) than the Over (1.65–2.14). Historically, these teams average **6.7 goals per game**, but this season’s matchups have seen them *allow* just **5.3 goals combined**. Either Carolina and Washington have suddenly become defensive masterminds, or bookmakers are still recovering from the 6-6 shootout classic last season.

**Digest the News**  
The Capitals are a mess. Second-to-last in their division, 14th in the East, and four points from the wild-card zone? They’ve lost key games recently, including a 2-3 heartbreaker to Tampa, and injuries aren’t helping. Meanwhile, Carolina is riding high, leading the Metro and buoyed by Petr Kockokov’s return. Their recent playoff victory over Washington in 2025? A fresh wound for the Caps, who’ll be playing catch-up while sipping lukewarm coffee.

The human drama? Evgeny Kuznetsov’s emotional return to Washington was more *The Office* than *The Sopranos*—Ovechkin tripped him for laughs, and Kuznetsov smiled through the theatrics. But let’s be real: Ovechkin’s 34th birthday (March 2025

Sun beamed through slivers my blackout curtains didn’t cover and warmed my face. I hated summer. The industrial AC unit in my room ran constantly; admittedly I ran it so much it snowed out of the back panels and landed on the carpeted floor. Enough had soaked in over the past two years I had given up on any hope of a security deposit.



As I glared at the spongy stain of carpet I lifted my hand up to my face to make sure what happened yesterday wasn’t a fever dream. No luck. The gap between my middle and pinky framed the piece of carpet nicely.



My face froze in panic almost as frigid as the flakes floating off the unit. It created quite a buzz, filled the room most days. Almost doubled as a white noise. My left ear couldn’t pick up the reverberation off the walls. It felt muted; it was there but muffled and wheezing. Slowly I turned my head so as my left ear would point directly at the unit. It became louder but even more so stifled as if it was buried beneath the bedrock of the foundation.



Like a madman I thrashed my head about to aim in every direction possible with my ear. All the same. Some parts were louder, some were completely silent, but all were not as it should be. It was then I knew, but would not allow it to be true in my head, what had happened.



Any bravery I’d ever had in my cowardly life was mustered into sliding my hand up. I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stiffen and static as my four fingers graced them. The stubble on my jaw scraped across the nails. My lobe, texture like kneaded dough, did not greet them. The lower cartilage neither. I discerned the dim warmness of my body heat emanating from my ear canal. This is the only familiarity I was greeted with. Sticking my index into the canal I twisted it, crawling each of my other fingers around the area feeling for any sign. There was none. An empty stage of skin was all that remained of my left ear, with a well dug in the center reaching the abyss.



Cold sweats hit my body and made the work clothes I hadn’t bothered to remove stick to me. I felt fragile, as if my whole being was shattering every night. Slowly I rose from the bed and went to the bathroom, leaning over the sink and staring at myself through the toothpaste stained mirror. I turned my head enough to where I could still get an eyeful of the ear. I’d hoped maybe it was my waking panic attack causing me to hallucinate, it had happened before. But the visual in the mirror couldn’t lie. The canal was still indeed there and working just as ever. But the rest was gone and replaced with… nothing. I don’t mean nothing I mean the same as the finger. Like I had lost the ear in some childhood accident. No scar tissue, no stitching, no discoloration. Just a flat patch of smoothed over skin like it had been formed that way at birth.



As I stared into the mirror my one good ear picked up a noise behind me. Metallic and rusty. Grinding and clanging. Chains, like that of manacles. My eyes in the mirror focused on the doorframe behind me and caught something. Sticking out not even an inch beyond where I could see was the heel of a foot. It was discolored and cracked dry, hued like a day old corpse with sickening purples and reds and browns.



I whipped my head behind me in swift action to find it was no longer there. In a state of dread I grabbed the first thing I could as a weapon and began creeping towards my room. If not for my heart in my throat I think I would’ve laughed at the idea of the police finding my body sprawled on the floor, clutching a plunger for dear life.



I stepped through the doorway to find the unnerving presence of nothing. Nothing touched, nothing disturbed, nothing broken. I set down my ‘weapon’ feeling a bit more at ease and gave a cursory scan of my room. A jangle of chain sounded outside my window, sounding almost exactly the same. Some internal spring of stupid courage sprung from me and I dashed to the window and ripped down the curtains. As the rod clanged to the floor the sun hit me with its full power and had me squinting. When I opened my eyes there was nothing there. The window wasn’t even open.



Cracking the window open and peering outside I was caught by a sound below me. The wet hiss of a spraypaint can had me look down. It was him. Although his face was focused on his work and thus not exposed I recognized the disheveled clothes from yesterday.



“Hey!” I shouted down to him.



The man looked up and sure enough it was him. Dream Man. When his eyes locked with mine he gave a chuckle, tossed the can haphazardly, and pushed off the wall to run.



“Hey!” I ventured again but he was already hopping off the curb.



I busted out of my bedroom door, into the living room, snagged my gloves and now a beanie on my way past them, and sped out of and around my apartment building. I got to Dream Man’s spot too late as when I looked in the direction he sped off he was already a block down.



“Stay out of my house and away from me!” I shouted one more time at him, my throat now cracking from the other two.



Turning around to leave, his art piece on the outside wall caught my eye. I stopped myself to view it. A crest, like ones of old royalty. In the center was a shield with four panels colored red and black. Within the panels were four silver dogs facing left, a paw raised and snout pointed. Atop the shield was the head of a boar with a banner wrapped round its eyes as if blindfolded. Within the banner on its leftmost was a letter V. It seemed I caught him before he could finish.



The stranger thing was, the deeper my gaze fell onto it, the more recognizable it became. I felt the sensation of a wooden pole sliding into my clenched fist, a weight seemed to apparate onto my shoulders; the taste of someone else’s blood in my mouth.



“Dude, you okay?” came a pleasant but startling voice to my right.



Snapping out of my trance I gasped and jumped with a scare, darting my head at the voice to see Lena. She wore her usual outside of work regalia of ragged black hoodie, ripped jeans, and flats that I could only describe as well loved.



“What?” is the only word I could spit out.



“You okay? You looked pissed, man,” she repeated.



“Really?” another one word response.



“Yeah. Like you’d kill someone or something. Personally I don’t think they did a bad job but everyone’s a critic,”.



The confused glance I gave her caused Lena to point out the sprayed coat of arms. A joke. If only she knew how accurate she was though. I did want to kill. In that moment the only thing that felt like home would’ve been blood on my hands.



“Oh… yeah… right,” I chortled with a very weak fake laugh.



“So anyway, you working today?” Lena grinned at me.



Work. Shit. And as if me being late didn’t put my employment in jeopardy the next thing that spurted from my lips would.



“Nah, day off. You?”.



“Same. You wanna hang?”



Instinctively, knowing Lena’s place was just the basement in her Aunt’s house, I went for my apartment keys. I couldn’t find them. In my rush to cover my missing pieces I hadn’t turned the other direction to snag them off the table.



“Well, Lena, sometimes in life we-”.



“You locked yourself out again?”.



“Yeah,”.



“Alright, let’s go loser,”.



Lena, waiting long not being her style, brushed past me and started walking towards the center of town. Trying to push down whatever amalgamation of existential chaos my life had become, I followed her like a beat dog down the pavement.



\* \* \*



A corner cafe in a small, unassuming town. The familiar aroma of roasted beans and steamed milk, creamy tan and dark brown paint along the walls. The speaker system playing some obscure band from 2003 low enough as to not disturb the delicate balance of sounds and conversations. To anyone, hell even to me, it felt like a calm oasis. It used to.



Lena and I had found a corner table and she had made her way to the counter. I preoccupied myself by indulging into paranoia through the shop window. My eyes scanned every corner and crevice where someone could hide. Used the rest of my spare brain power to study the patrons inside. That man was following me, he or someone or something was in my fucking house. I didn’t know who I could trust at all. The sound of porcelain clanging to the wood table snapped me back to what I assumed was reality.



“Coffee, black. Don’t know how you stomach the shit,” Lena said as she sat next to me, sipping what I assumed to be more sugar than anything else.



“Thanks…”.



I lifted the cup to my face. Even the wafting aroma didn’t help.



“I see you decided to round out the glove look with a hat. All in summer,” Lena prodded with a smile.



“Just leave it be, yeah?!” I snapped.



The look Lena shot me was one I never wanted to become familiar with. Betrayal. Dejection. Amongst everything else going on my heart broke for what I'd done.



“I-I’m sorry,” I sheepishly stated.



“It’s okay. You seem really stressed,” she put her hand on my shoulder.



“That’s putting it lightly,”.



“What’s going on?”.



I couldn’t tell her. Not fully. Put yourself in her shoes. Best friend reveals that pieces of his body are gone and that they are taken from him in the night. Anyone sane or caring would check that person into a facility. And it’s a kind gesture for those ignorant. But I’ve been in enough to know that unless you shell out for private care, those dungeons don’t help. God they don’t help.



“Lena, I have been good - well - stable for a long time. Since I’ve known you. But for a long time before I wasn’t. Skipping the waterworks my childhood wasn’t very good to me and I struggled a lot with, how do I put it… I struggled with knowing what’s real and what’s not,” so began my rant, Lena just nodded and looked with kind and hopeful eyes. “It’s been a struggle, and I fought for a long time to get where I’m at. But now - now I feel myself sinking back in. There is something in my head or someone out here dragging me back by the ankles. I feel powerless and I am scared and I don’t want to hurt you. But I don’t know what else to do,”.



Without words Lena leaned in and wrapped her arms around me. I felt my heartbeat slowly come in sync with hers and my breathing subsided, my sweat desist. When she detached her and I both looked more at peace. I certainly felt it, even if it was just a sliver.



“I’m sorry you had to go through whatever you did. And I can’t understand it, not all of it. But I’m here for you, dude. What can I do to help? You said someone might be involved, you need me to pay them a visit? I’ll fold someone like laundry if I have to,”.



For the first time in what felt like ages I squeaked out a laugh. Lena reciprocated and I felt another one escape me and then another.



“Thank you,” I smiled at her.



“It’s what people like me are here for,”.



“People like you?”.



“Friends,”.



\* \* \*



Noon had passed into evening and as the sun dipped down below the horizon Lena and I found ourselves back outside my apartment. As we waited for the hole I threw money into labelled locksmith Lena pulled her phone out and began typing.



“What’s up?” I nodded my head to her phone.



“You were telling me about that guy. Homeless guy or whatever. He might be messing with you?”.



I had? When? I supposed I really must be falling off if I couldn’t even remember that. As I said it had been awhile but I remembered before I would sometimes ‘lose time’.



“Yeah, sure,” I responded, trying to cover for my lapse.



“I’m looking up the tag he threw up. It’s a long shot but it looks like a real symbol. Maybe it tells us something about him?”.



She was grasping at straws, sure, but I appreciated that she would even bother. Sure enough though she was right as Lena waved me to come closer. A historical archive site displayed the same crest under the heading ‘HOUSE MACALLISTER’. Her and I both leaned in to read further.



*House MacAllister. Scottish/English noble house. The first records historians could find date back to the first half of the 13th century. Plagued throughout its existence until the house’s fall in 1651 with rumor and accusation of using black magic and/or dark animism. The MacAllister House’s origin is even steeped in a rumor of seiðr influence. Its founder, Patric MacAllister, was believed to have used human sacrifice to obtain ‘future sight’ or direct power and thus how he began his reign.*



Lena and I both looked at each other in hesitant curiosity before going back for more.



*The MacAllisters were attributed in documents with great feats of battle prowess. Known for great skill in war, their ferocity and mercilessness was feared and renowned. But as in all history, everything must fall. During the Battle of Worcester for the War of the Three Kingdoms, MacAllister met its final day. Although historians do not condone the belief of magic, the historical record from surviving clans involved in the battle contest a dark happening during and after the battle. Claims of witches, more specifically The Gwiddonod (a nebulous collection of nine sorceresses assumed to be malevolent) influencing the battlefield and even striking down various men amidst the battle. Another claim suggests that after the defeat of House MacAllister a sickly fog fell upon the battlefield and when it lifted many of the bodies had simply disappeared. Archeologists searching the area have found a distinctively sparse collection of corpses while searching the area but attribute it to rapid decay and desperate peasantry stripping the field clean for anything to eat or sell. However, if asking those witnessing clans at the time, all would say the Gwiddonod took the corpses as payment for the debt started by Patric MacAllister all those centuries past. The-*



“Hey, we gonna get this finished or what?” said a deep voice from behind us.



Lena and I both turned from her phone to see the locksmith behind us. It was the same guy every time and judging from his tone I assumed he was quite fed up with me.



“Sorry,” I responded.



“If you really are, stop doing this,” he said as we got up and approached him.



All three of us went to my door and the smith began fiddling with the lock.



“I don’t mean to be too rude but how do you keep doing this?” said the smith, grunting as he jimmied the lock to and fro.



“How about you just get it done, alright?” Lena spoke up for me. I gave her a glance as thank you.



“Oh, don’t worry, I always do. We always do. Ain’t that right, Smiley?”.



Every vertebra in my spine was shocked stiff. A haze fogged the inside of my skull. Smiley. Smiley?!



“What did you call me?” I said to him with fear.



“What?”.



“Say what you said again,”.



“I told your girlfriend that I was working on it. Didn’t say or call you anything, bud,”.



“I didn’t hear anything either,” Lena told me. “Can you hurry up? I don't think my friend is feeling well and we better let him lay down,” she snapped at the smith.



Not a moment later the lock shifted open and the door swung wide. Thoroughly irritated, the smith immediately got to his feet and gathered his tools.



“I’ll bill your landlord,”.



He walked off and I tracked him with glazed eyes as he did. He turned back to me. And now replacing the face of the smith was another. The Dream Man’s. He smiled at me, tipped his hat, and looked away. I would have screamed if the panic inside didn’t choke out every piece of energy in me. I grew pale.



“Whoah, let’s get you inside right now,” Lena said, worry trembling in her voice as she took me by the arm.



She led me into the room and sat me down at my bed. I was so scared to sleep but my body went into auto pilot and spread itself across the mattress. Lena went outside my door and checked my mail before closing us both inside. As she flipped through each parcel she left them on my desk for later.



“W-what are you doing?” I eeked out.



“No talking, rest. Do you ever check your mail, dude? Seriously I-”.



She went silent. I raised my head off the pillow enough to look at her. She held one final envelope in her hand and stared at it. It looked handwritten; personal.



“What?” I asked.



“You grew up in Wisconsin, right?” is all she said back, her tone now low and flat.



“Yeah. Lena, what is it?”.



“Can I open it?”.



“If you tell me what it is,”.



“I need to open it to tell you. To know for sure,” a hint of sadness creeped in now.



“Fine,” I gave up.



Her fingers slowly inserted into the flap and she ripped a slot open with her nails. Pulling out a tri-folded piece of paper she read it and kept me in suspense.



“Well?!” I begged.



“It’s-It’s-I’m so sorry…” Lena looked up at me, her eyes welling with tears.



She never did that. Cry. I didn’t either. This was big. A surge of nervous energy came back to me and I got up and walked to her. Reaching out my hand she put the letter into it and stepped away, putting a hand on my shoulder as she went to another part of the apartment.



*To whomever it may concern,*



*We regret to inform you that on the night of July 11th, 2025 due to complications from stroke Edie May Allen has passed away. Our company, Andlat Funeral Services, would like to extend our sincerest apologies to you and your family.* 

*As the burial and legal service company procured to handle the after death care we would like you to know we will try our best to make this as simple and easy a process as possible. We do, however, need you to come to our local offices to do a will reading and ascertain your legal claims to any leftover property.*

*We hope this letter finds you well and that we can help in any way possible. Please do not hesitate to contact us.*

*- Steven Andlat, Andlat Funeral Services* 



I folded the paper back up and put it in my pocket. No description could tell me or others what I felt. Empty perhaps. Empty.



“Who was it?” Lena asked gently.



“ … My mother…”.



“I’m so sorry,”.



I looked at Lena, a tear dripped down her cheek. A twinge in my chest carried to my throat; the telltale sign of a weep. But it stopped there. No outward expression of my pain came.



“It’s okay. Her and I’s relationship was… complicated,”.



“Do you need anything?”.



“No, I-” I began but halted. “Actually, yes,”.



“Anything,” Lena replied.



“Would you come to Wisconsin with me? I have to clear this up and I don’t think I should be alone,”.



I felt bad lying to her, she didn’t deserve it. What I had said, baseline, was true. I shouldn’t be alone. But it wasn't because of my mother, at least not mostly. If I had someone around perhaps it would ward off what was happening. I couldn’t stand to lose another piece or else I might have fallen completely off the deep end. Lena was a comfort but she was a naive watchful eye for whoever or whatever was butchering me. Maybe it killed my mother?



I admit there was a pang of guilt for how I felt. It was sadness for her but it was a lion’s share something else. It was a long awaited goodbye. Like the look in the eyes of an old man, well travelled, knowing his best and worst days are behind him and now all there is is to wait. A melancholic acceptance.



The next hour or so was spent packing up my car and making sure the thing would still run. As Lena threw together some road snacks and drinks I finished gathering an outfit or two off my floor. That’s when it caught me, in the periphery of my vision.

 

I set down the bundle of clothes in my arms and tiptoed towards it. There, in the carpet right outside of the bathroom doorframe, was a black footprint. The black was a rot I could not discern and amidst the inky blotch writhed white corpse maggots. It wasn’t a hallucination. Someone had been watching me this morning. I needed to leave.



“You ready?” I heard Lena behind me.



I threw an old shirt next to the print over it. I wanted to tell her but something itched in me that it was sinister and I didn’t want her hurt. I turned around and faced her.



“Ready as ever, I suppose,”.



She playfully punched me on the chest.



“It’ll get easier, I promise,”.



With that I gathered up my spare outfit and we headed out the door. I turned to close and lock up and it stared me down. The footprint. The shirt had been moved and it had grown noticeably larger. I slammed the door in anger and turned the key. If only I knew what I would return to, I may never have left. ",2,1762896508.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

It’s a blank canvas aside from a couple of existing pieces, and I’m currently stuck on one decision: which wood tone to choose for my dining set.

The focus right now is the kitchen dining area, but I want to keep things cohesive as I furnish the living room (sofa, coffee table, media console, etc.). I don’t need a perfect tone match, but I want everything to look intentional since it’s all in close proximity.

We’ve narrowed it down to two tones (pictured in the attached swatches):

- West Elm “Cool Walnut” — the lighter, slightly orange-toned swatch (we’ve decided on the Aubin Round Dining Table + chairs)

- Darker walnut — a cooler, chocolate-brown tone that gives us more options

The photos show both samples on my floors in different lighting (daylight vs. evening). The floors are a medium honey oak with noticeable grain, and I intend for the rest of the space to lean Scandinavian / Mid-Century — light sofa, clean lines, plants, and some black metal accents (lamp, DWR bookshelf, etc.).

I’m torn between:

- Lighter “Cool Walnut”, which blends better with the floor but might look too orange once I add a light (ivory/sand) couch, neutral rug, and possibly darker living room furniture

- Darker walnut, which adds contrast and feels more deliberate with black accents, but might look too bold or heavy for the space. In my mind, the contrast may make it look out of place.

I’ve attached a couple AI mockups of the table setups, which I think come relatively close to what the ultimate result would look like, but of course they are not absolutely accurate, so take them with a grain of salt.

I’m curious what others think when you see it in the context of the space.

**TL;DR:** Which wood stain (shown in the swatches) would you choose for this space: the lighter West Elm “Cool Walnut” or the darker walnut?",3,1762896211.0,interiordecorating,10,1.0,False

I found myself playing a rhythm earlier while improvising some Bossa Nova and it finally triggered something in me. This is a rhythm I have been tapping with pens and clicking with fingers since I learned it, which is likely a few years ago. More on that later. For now, I am slowly delving into insanity, and I need your help.

[The rhythm in 3\/4 and subsequently the same rhythm in 4\/4](https://preview.redd.it/qzisy8vx2p0g1.png?width=1479&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe82971ff8dd1e94db9dc8b5860c5d41f558f4f5)

This 2+2+1+2+2+2+1 = 12-note rhythm.



Now, I learned this rhythm in a youtube video. I vaguely remember it being called something along the lines of ""How do you count this rhythm?"" or ""In which time signature is this rhythm?"" Unfortunately, the exact name escapes me, else I would've found it and long since escaped from this spiral of madness I have gone down. 



My motivation for this exercise in futility is simply to learn the name of this rhythm. This is initially why I wanted to go back to this video. If any of you know the name of the rhythm, feel free to tell me. 



However, I still yearn with an ache in my heart to see this video once more. I recall it being a rather interesting exploration of this rhythm's metric ambiguity, but I cannot for the life of me remember who made the video. Hence the spiral into pure hysteria. 



I have long lived with the conviction that I learned this rhythm from an Adam Neely video, however after much searching of his channel, as well as a few others, I have come up with nothing, save for a few bouts of deranged rambling. If ANYONE knows what this video is, and can link me to it, so help me God I will buy you a coffee, one way or another.

A few things to mention before I get into my choices… 1) Lego only does 12 figures per series now, meaning that’s what I will do as well 2) Lego has strict rules about what themes are considered appropriate for their sets, so while The Simpsons has plenty of alcohol, smoking and religious iconography in it, I can’t realistically include characters or accessories that reference those things. Also, it is unknown whether Lego would be comfortable doing guns for Looney Tunes characters after controversy, so characters who should have gun accessories don’t in this series. However Warner Bros do seem more comfortable bringing up Pepe Le Pew now so I included him 3) Lego likes to include at least 2 female characters per CMF series for female inclusion. Which is why you’ll see some less popular characters in the Simpsons series. However, I’ve decided to not go by this rule for the Muppets series because there aren’t enough female characters people would actually want to buy from the Muppets series. 4) The Looney Tunes series will include Tom and Jerry characters, because it fits the theme and I couldn’t think of 2 good characters from Looney Tunes to put in their place (Lego has also done this before with putting Wizard of Oz characters in the Lego Movie 2 series)

You didn't have much time to choose one; this is the best time to cut your losses and get someone who is experienced in the specifics of the allegations, and who takes you and the situation very seriously. 
2. If any of the counter-evidance is on your phone, get a new phone and treat the old phone as evidence. There are ways to confirm that photos and text messages are original and unchanged. They are expensive, but you might need that. 
3. Quit or seriously cut back on drinking or doing any mind altering substances. You will need your full mental capacity, and at the same time your anguish is going to be so sever that you'll run a serious risk of addiction and substance dependence. This is also important for blood pressure 
4. Similarly, consider giving up coffee. My blood pressure skyrocketed because of my mental anxiety. I am healthy and in good shape and of anything had low blood pressure before. Stress related high blood pressure is real and can really damage you
5. Exercise. Even if you don't feel it, you are very likely going to experience depression. Sleep, exercise, and healthy diet can literally save your life. Prefer activities that are with other people, especially if you can share with them (appropriately!) what you're going through.
6. Find a spiritual practice. I am very anti religion so I focus on witchcraft. I have been unable to meditate because of the constant buzz in my brain but I wish I could. 
7. Prepare an arrest kit in case this will happen again. A hoodie, a page with phone numbers and any words you want to recite / read / chant while in jail, anti anxiety medication like Xanax or klonopin

Ever since college (I'm in my 30's), I've had friendships that would last for years, anywhere from 5-10, and then just stop over something stupid, or something I consider drama.   
  
Example 1) I ended one friendship of 7 years because I was fed up of being the one to plan every outing we did. For 7 years, I had to drive to his house (gay male, platonic friendship), pick him up, make the plans. He never gave me gas money, never made any contributions to be fair about the situation. I finally got fed up and just stopped reaching out. I stopped texting him to see if he wanted to hang out. He never texted me asking to hang out. I sometimes wonder if he was testing me to see how long I would bend over backwards for him before I broke. 

  
Example 2) I ended a different friendship because she was being insanely dramatic with her family issues. She had just gone through a traumatic death in her family (her husband, my best friend), and he truly was the glue in our friendship circle. I always saw her nagging and crying on facebook about stupid stuff with her family (sisters), and it just got ridiculous after a while, so I unfriended her. This was before Facebook made an option to 'hide' people's content from your feed. She noticed I unfriended her, and rightfully got upset. We stopped being friends. I apologized time and time again, because I do feel bad about how immature I was, but I think we were all just trying to hold on because we were grieving a big death in our group. 

Example 3) I recently invited two of my closest gal pal coworkers to a concert I was going to in our city. It was a huge deal for me, as the band that was playing are some of my favorite people on this planet. I've hung out with these coworkers outside of work a couple of times, but maybe for an hour at most, getting lunch or coffee or something small. I told both of them how insanely important the show was to me, and it'd mean the world to me to have them at the show. Neither of them came, and gave me really long excuses about not going, but then I saw their instagram stories from that night and it was contradicting their stories. I got insanely hurt. If you don't wanna go, don't go and just say so. But to build up hype all month and then not go at the last minute stung so bad. I get along with them at work, but I won't be inviting them anywhere now because I don't want to get my hopes up.

I just feel like I get drained emotionally and mentally from my friendships, and I just leave. I want to protect my peace, but now I don't have any close friends anymore. I have a lot of friends scattered across the country (US) due to my hobby of traveling for concerts, but they're not deep friendships and in the last 8 years, I feel like I haven't had a close friendship at home (my previous 3 examples were hometown friends). I want a deep friendship with someone, but I always find a reason to run.

Nothing. Ship just stays there and I softlock with no way to advance. So something about my load order is doing something, but I cannot pin what.

**ENVIROMENT**: I am playing on an XBOX Series X and using Creations to download mods.

**LOAD ORDER**: To potentially save time, I have *329 mods installed*. This number becomes *294* if you don't include the sorters (mods that are there to help label/organize the load order but has 0 game affect). These are represented at the start of each table and are bolded below. I am using 20.49 GB of the available 100 GB of space.

Of course I do not expect people to know how almost 300 random mods work together, but more so to see if something stands out that is a red flag. Also, any suggestion on my LO is also welcomed.

Thanks for any assistance.

**EDIT**: Sorry, I found it easier to type this LO in excel after doing the first 5 tables in the reddit editor. Apologies it looks weird after that.

1oulr1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adamthewoocriticism/comments/1oulr1o/adams_in_deep_trouble_in_2026/,Adam's in deep trouble in 2026,"I found this online a few minutes ago. If this comes true in 2026. Adam will be something he totally depises. It's a little long to read but you'll see if Adam doesn't change his strategy soon he's finished!

It is speculative whether YouTube advertising revenue will decrease overall in 2026, as recent data shows mixed trends, but experts suggest that for individual vloggers, revenue may be unstable or decline without strategic adaptation. The key trend is that content creators are increasingly diversifying their income and reducing reliance solely on ad revenue due to its volatility. 

Key Factors and Trends for 2026:
Volatility and Unpredictability: Ad revenue has been reported as unpredictable, with some creators experiencing significant drops (up to 75%) since early 2025, while others are having their ""best year ever"". This suggests individual results depend heavily on specific strategies and niches.

Algorithm and Platform Shifts: Changes in YouTube's algorithms, such as a potential shift towards promoting Shorts (which are currently lower earners than long-form content) or favoring different types of engagement, can negatively impact views and ad impressions for traditional vloggers.

Economic Conditions: General economic conditions, such as a potential recession, can cause advertisers to pull back their spending, leading to lower Cost Per Mille (CPM) rates for creators.

Increased Competition and Content Saturation: The platform is becoming more competitive, with an influx of new channels (including AI-generated content), making it harder for individual vloggers to maintain consistent viewership and ad revenue.

Diversification as a Strategy: Many successful YouTubers are now operating like media companies, developing alternative income streams such as product lines (e.g., coffee brands, energy drinks), merchandise, channel memberships, and brand deals. This lessens the impact of ad revenue fluctuations.

Importance of Ad Strategy: The move towards new ad formats like Google's ""Demand Gen"" campaigns and dynamic ad insertion may favor creators who can adapt their content strategy to align with these changes. 

In conclusion, while total ad spend in the digital market might grow, the slice of that pie for individual vloggers relying on the old model is less secure. To succeed in 2026, vloggers are advised to focus on high-quality, differentiating content and diversify their monetization methods beyond just AdSense.

1oulr0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1oulr0e/aitah_for_refusing_to_give_a_girl_money_for_gas/,AITAH for refusing to give a girl money for gas,"A bit of background before I get to the point:

I (20M) downloaded bumble about a month or two ago before deleting it a few weeks back because I wasn’t getting any matches and didn’t want to pay for premium. I had put my snap username in my bio so people could add me. 

However, even after I had deleted the app, I still had people adding me on snap saying they got my username through bumble. A little odd but I ignored it. Most of the girls who added me didn’t respond so I’d send a message, wait 12-24 hours before unadding them. Until this one girl added me; I’ll call her Sarah.

Sarah (20F) seemed nice enough and really interested in me, and I was interested as well. Though I was a bit standoffish at first. I don’t really trust dating apps since a couple years back, my brother was almost kidnapped and trafficked by a girl he met on tinder who wasn’t who she said she was. Ever since that incident I take every precaution I can.

I had asked Sarah to send me a selfie of her holding a paper with the day’s date on it to prove she was who she said she was. She seemed a bit miffed but did it anyway. She was pretty forceful about meeting up ASAP and I agreed to meet up at a coffee shop after my shift. I sent her the location of a Starbucks and waited there for her to show up. She never did.

She didn’t respond to my texts until around midnight and asked if I still wanted to hookup. I declined because I had to be up early in the morning and I didn’t really want her at my house because it’s a mess. I asked if she wanted to hang out the next day and she immediately demanded that I send her money for gas because she was out.

That took me a bit off guard but I explained that I’m a bit tight on money right now and couldn’t afford to give her anything. She borderline begged me to give her at least $20 but I didn’t budge. She said fine and didn’t talk to me for the rest of the night.

I still kept reaching out to keep conversation going but she would only send short responses or just leave me on read. I thought I wasn’t being interesting and promised that I’m better at conversation in person. She brought up the money for gas again and said we could have a good time together.

By this point everything felt a little sketchy and I had thought of just blocking her and calling it a day multiple times. Instead I explained that I wasn’t comfortable giving money to someone I don’t know very well and if I HAD to pay her for us to meet, then it wouldn’t be a good idea. She got pissed and accused me of having trust issues and calling her a gold digger. I just laughed and wished her well.

Looking back on it now I do kinda feel like an ass for not giving her money for gas but something about it just didn’t feel right. I talked to my friends and they said I did the right thing setting my boundaries and not letting her cross them, but I still don’t know if that’s true.

1oulp8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1oulp8y/i_feel_like_my_male_fwb_is_sabotaging_my_love_life/,I feel like my male FWB is sabotaging my love life,"ME (23F) and my friend (24M) have been FWBs for the past 8 months and unfortunately I've caught feelings for this man and he's not making moving on any easier for me.

Him and I have been friends for I'd say about 5 years and we never really had anything going on until earlier this year when we both ended up single. We always had a lot in common and we always had a lot of fun together and I guess after being single for a while one thing led to another and one night we hooked up. Since we were both very attracted to eachother we just continued hanging out, having fun and hooking up every now and then, lately almost everytime we see eachother. 

I caught feelings quite early on because in my head he was the perfect guy for me: funny, smart extroverted, had lot of knowledge about music, movies and pop culture, successful, strong, protective and able to take care of things...however he is emotionally unavailable and has commitment issues. I tried to convince him that we should try dating because we basically behave like we already are minus some cutesy couple things like nicknames but he said he can't do relationships right now because he has too many issues going on in his life right now and also has a fear of dating after his ex fucked him up mentally. 

I just ended up confronting him about it and told him how I don't want to be replaced by someone else just because we're not together and that he shouldnt let me go so easily. He said he wont do that but told me that in case I do go to another guy he wants it to be someone who will take good care of me. I didn't think that he thought of that as some deal for us to be exclusive so I realized I should be open to dates with other guys if I get asked out.

So last month I ran into an old friend of mine after a year and a half of not talking and he has been showing interest in me ever since. I didn't go out on a date with him but we hung out twice and I started being open to dating him in the future. I also went out for coffee with a friend of a friend because he seemed nice and was interested in me. I ended up telling my FWB about this because I wanted him to know that there is a possibility that I might no longer do things with him and he got pissed off. He told me how upset he is that I asked him not to replace me when I was gonna replace him. He said how shitty he feels that I'm going on dates behind his back and that he can't trust me.

 I got angry back at him and told him how its his fault for not wanting to commit when I wanted him no matter what stage in life he is. He appologized, took me out, we talked about it, he admitted to having feelings and said he lost it because he realized he was going to be lonely again because I made him feel less lonely. He  showed a lot of affection that evening yet still didn't agree to a relationship. He did say he has no right to be jelaous yet I still feel like he wants to keep me for himself.

Now I'm stuck feeling guilty if I ever give anyone else a chance. I have this other guy basically going above and beyond trying to show me how much I can get from him and he checks all the boxes yet I feel like a complete bitch if I ditch my FWB because I feel like I'll hurt his feelings and I can't let go of the idea that things wont be the same between us after 5 years of friendship and that I'll have to make peace that there will be nothing more than this after I spent months trying to get him to like me hoping for a relationship. I know that I'm allowed to be with whoever I wanna be but I feel so guilty after he blew up at me. Idk what to do. He became clingier and more invested after he realized that he might lose me and it's just making it harder.",0,1762895558.0,TwoXChromosomes,12,0.5,False

I’ve been working on a small project called [Globy](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/globy-solo-travel-activities/id6752544812?l=en-GB).

So I built an app that gamifies your social life. You can post or join small activities like grabbing coffee, going for a walk, or trying something new in your city. You earn XP and achievements for joining or organizing real-life activities.

It’s now live on iOS and I’m trying to see if people connect with the concept. The goal isn’t to make socializing feel like a game, it’s to make it feel more fun and give people that extra push to meet others.

I’d really like to hear feedback from other builders or entrepreneurs here. Do you think gamifying social interaction can actually change behaviour, or is this the kind of idea that only sounds good in theory?",4,1762895382.0,SideProject,2,1.0,False

Basically we would go a week without any contact, then hit eachother up when we have something to say (it was 80% me, 20% her), basically random shit like ""i bought xxxx"", ""how are you"", ""can you order this for me"", ""wanna go out"", etc..... 

Then we kinda talked for 3 4 days, less than usual but still talked, (sometimes went out for coffee, sometimes shopping, somwtimes to the cinema, once or so a month also having sex or kissing) and then she would always say that she felt that was wrong and she has a guilty conscience, and that we had to go no contact again, then i would ""beg"" with the usual ""why, we just started being happy again, things got better, i changed the bad things about me blah blah blah"" but the cycle went back into no contact.

After a few months of that, she didnt even mention that she wanted to go no contact again that she felt bad or smthn, she just stopped answering and started ghosting, then i would hit her up with multiple messages cause i wanted to understand why after a week or 2 of being good to eachother, going out, having fun, why would she ghost me. And then she again would mention the quilty conscience and that what we are doing is not okay. 

And this cycle just went on and on for a whole year, the times varied always, but lets say on average our no contact lasted for 2 weeks each time, then a week or 2 of talking, going out, having intimate moments, and then 3 to 4 days of ghosting and so on in a circle. 

Also when the things got a little more heated from my side cause of her ghosting, she would sometimes with her guilty conscience comments reassure me that she has no feelings toward me, and that she is only doing all those things with me because she still feels safe with me and that ""its the only thing she knows, that shes used to"".

Also jsut to mention, the biggest obstacle i feel in all of this is that i was her first relationship.. (she sometimes brought up the fact that she still hasnt experienced anything besides me, and that she cant know that way what she needs or wants because she doesnt know if i was the best or the worst)

I know we are hella young and all, and i know that with enough time i would probably get over her and find another girl, but we have been together for 2 years, and plus one year of this NC/situationship cycle thingy and even after all the pain, even after being a month of no contact, after talking to even better looking girls who i truly connected to, i still just see her her and nobody else on thsi planet. I think about her when i wake up, through the day atleast 10 times, and for a full hour or 2 before sleep each day. (Im a HEAVY and i mean HEAVY overthinker, i literally cannot sleep at night before rethinking 50 negative scenarios of what she might be doing right now)

Idk if its the delusion in me but i know my good side, and i know her good side, and i really think this could work 10 times better if we tried again but communicated better..

Alex's existence in the Brooklyn apartment with John, the undeniably-immortal-but-won't-admit-it billionaire who ran Aegis Q, sipped whiskey with Lucifer, and had been praised on national television for not aging in 27 years, was a daily plunge into a reality where logic had filed for divorce and fled to another dimension.

By now, Alex had moved beyond certainty into the realm of obsessive documentation. His Excel spreadsheet had grown to **58 entries** across three color-coded tabs: Evidence of Immortality (green), Deflections/Excuses (red), and Food Bribes (yellow, because everything John cooked was suspiciously perfect). John was immortal. Had to be. The evidence wasn't just a mountain—it was Everest, K2, and Kilimanjaro stacked on top of each other with a flag that said ""YOUR ROOMMATE IS ETERNAL"" planted at the summit.

But here's what made Alex want to rent a billboard in Times Square just to scream into the void: **John still wouldn't say it.**

Every confrontation ended the same way. Alex would present ironclad evidence—military papers, Death's tea party, Lucifer's Excalibur stories, Victor Langston's CNBC interview—and John would deflect with food, pivot to Netflix, or make a joke so disarming that Alex forgot he was interrogating a cosmic being.

It was psychological warfare disguised as roommate banter, and Alex was losing badly.

So when a four-star general showed up at their door, in civilian clothes, asking John to present his ""military works"" to the Pentagon while the U.S. military still thought John was just an exceptional mortal consultant, Alex's brain didn't just malfunction—it staged a coup, declared independence, and applied for asylum in a universe where roommates were just... roommates.

# The General at the Door

It was a crisp Saturday morning, and Alex was nursing a hangover from too many of John's artisanal margaritas (because of course the guy who owned islands could mix drinks like a Prohibition-era bartender). He'd stayed up until 2 AM updating his spreadsheet after yesterday's Victor Langston revelation, adding detailed notes about ""hasn't aged since 1998"" and ""TV interview with millions of witnesses.""

John was sprawled on the couch, reading a book that looked suspiciously like a first-edition *Art of War* (probably annotated by Sun Tzu himself, at this point Alex wouldn't be surprised), while the Heart of Karnataka ruby glinted on the coffee table next to a half-eaten bagel.

A knock at the door—sharp, authoritative, like someone was about to declare war or deliver a court summons—jolted Alex upright, his headache flaring.

He shuffled over, expecting a delivery or maybe the FBI finally catching up to John's centuries of tax evasion (did immortals pay taxes? Alex added that to his mental list of questions). Instead, he faced a man who radiated command like a walking five-star hotel made of military discipline and steel.

Mid-60s, broad-shouldered, with a buzz cut that could've been trimmed with a protractor and eyes that looked like they'd stared down entire armies without blinking. He was in civilian clothes—a crisp polo and pressed khakis—but his posture screamed *I have launched missiles and slept soundly afterward*. A faint scar ran across his jaw, and his watch was a rugged chronograph that probably cost more than Alex's car and had survived actual combat zones.

""I'm General William Kessler, U.S. Army, retired,"" he said, voice like gravel that had been to war and won. ""I need to speak with John Harrow.""

Alex's hangover vanished, replaced by a sinking feeling that started in his stomach and ended somewhere near his toes. *An Army general?* At their dumpy apartment? Was John about to be court-martialed for something he did in the Civil War?

He mumbled, ""Uh, yeah, he's inside,"" and let Kessler in, his brain already drafting an escape plan that involved grabbing the ruby and running.

John looked up from his book, unfazed as ever. ""Bill! Long time, mate. Coffee?""

*Bill?* They were on a first-name basis? Of course they were. Alex wanted to cry.

Kessler's stern face softened slightly, but he waved off the offer. ""No time, John. I'm here on business. The Pentagon wants you to present your military works at a classified briefing next week.""

Alex, hovering by the fridge like a deer caught in headlights, nearly dropped his bagel. *Military works?* He flashed to John's discharge papers—Lieutenant Colonel, WWII; Major, WWI; Civil War commendations—and the photo with Eisenhower. What ""works"" was Kessler talking about? D-Day strategies? Gettysburg tactics? Battle plans from the freaking *Peloponnesian War*?

# The Pentagon's Mortal Misunderstanding

Kessler sat at the kitchen table, pulling a slim folder from his satchel. ""The Joint Chiefs are impressed, John. Since you started consulting in 2005—Iraq surge, Afghanistan logistics, that drone swarm tech—your work's been game-changing. They don't ask about what you did before that."" He tapped the folder. ""Your file's so classified even I can't read most of it. They figure you're ex-Agency or something deeper. Point is, they want you to present your strategies at a classified briefing.""

Alex's jaw hit the floor. *Ex-Agency?* The military thought John was ex-CIA, not an immortal who'd fought in the Civil War?

John grinned, flipping through the folder. ""I like to keep a low profile, Bill. The less they know, the better for operational security. Sure, I'll do the briefing. But only if they spring for good coffee—Pentagon brew tastes like boot leather.""

Kessler chuckled. ""You haven't changed since I met you in '08. Still living like a grad student, still deflecting questions about your past."" He glanced around the apartment. ""The Chiefs assume you've got your reasons for the low profile. They respect that. Just don't make them regret trusting you.""

John's smile softened. ""Never have, never will. Tell them I'll bring slides.""

Kessler's gaze landed on the ""prop"" sword—Excalibur—leaning against a pizza box. ""Still into historical reenactments?"" he asked, nodding at it.

John shrugged, sipping his coffee. ""Keeps things fun, Bill. You know me—history nerd at heart.""

Kessler nodded, clearly buying the lie, and stood to leave. ""Next week, John. The Pentagon's expecting you. Don't pull any of your... stunts."" He shot John a look that suggested he'd heard about the mugger takedown or maybe the time John disarmed a terrorist cell with a butter knife (Alex was just guessing at this point, but it wouldn't surprise him).

John just winked. ""No promises, but I'll behave. Mostly.""

Kessler adjusted his satchel, gave Alex a polite nod, and strode to the door. Before leaving, he turned back, his expression serious. ""John, whatever you've done over the years—Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, the black ops stuff we don't talk about—it's made a difference. The country owes you more than you know.""

John's grin softened, just a fraction. ""Just doing my part, Bill. Tell the Chiefs I'll bring slides. Maybe a PowerPoint. Keep it professional.""

Kessler left with a firm handshake, and the door clicked shut, leaving Alex standing in the kitchen, his bagel forgotten, his mind a pinball machine of panic and conspiracy.

# Alex's Military-Grade Meltdown

As soon as Kessler's footsteps faded down the hall, Alex exploded.

""AN ARMY GENERAL?!"" he shouted, his voice hitting a pitch that could've shattered Excalibur. ""The PENTAGON wants you to brief the JOINT CHIEFS? They think you're the 'Patton of our generation'? John, you fought in WORLD WAR TWO! And WORLD WAR ONE! And the CIVIL WAR! You probably invented WAR!""

John, pouring more coffee with infuriating calm, chuckled. ""I didn't invent war, Alex. War's been around since cavemen figured out rocks could bonk heads. I just helped refine the tactics a bit.""

""REFINE THE TACTICS?!"" Alex was flailing now, hands waving like he was directing invisible traffic. ""You've got discharge papers from THREE WARS! You've got a photo with EISENHOWER! And now a FOUR-STAR GENERAL is calling you a prodigy and asking for a classified briefing!""

John slid a plate of scrambled eggs toward Alex—perfectly fluffy, obviously—and sat down. ""Bill's a good guy. Worked with him during the Gulf War—gave him some tips on logistics. He thinks I'm just a really experienced consultant. Happens all the time.""

""IT DOES NOT HAPPEN ALL THE TIME!"" Alex's voice cracked. ""Normal consultants don't get personal visits from retired generals! They don't get invited to the Pentagon to present 'military works' spanning DECADES!""

John took a bite of toast, unbothered. ""The Pentagon loves a good briefing. It's mostly PowerPoint slides and coffee. I'll throw in some drone specs, talk about supply chain optimization, maybe mention that thing I did in Kandahar. Easy.""

""KANDAHAR?!"" Alex grabbed the counter to keep from collapsing. ""When were you in Kandahar?!""

John waved a hand. ""2008-ish? Or was it 2011? Time blurs when you're consulting. Helped with some tactical stuff—nothing major. Want more eggs?""

Alex wanted to scream. Instead, he did what he always did: he grabbed his phone and texted Sarah, his hands trembling.

**""AN ARMY GENERAL WANTS JOHN TO BRIEF THE PENTAGON. THEY THINK HE'S MORTAL. CALLED HIM 'PATTON OF OUR GENERATION.' STILL WON'T ADMIT IMMORTALITY.""**

Sarah's reply was a video of her screaming into a history textbook, captioned: **""STEAL HIS DISCHARGE PAPERS. WE'RE GOING TO THE JOINT CHIEFS.""**

Alex pocketed his phone and collapsed into a chair, staring at the eggs John had made. They were perfect. Of course they were. Everything John made was perfect, because he'd probably been cooking since fire was invented.

# The Immortal Strategist's Deflection

""Okay,"" Alex said, his voice hoarse from shouting. ""Let me get this straight. The U.S. military—the most powerful military on the planet—thinks you're just a really smart consultant. They have no idea you've been alive for centuries, fought in wars they study in history books, and probably advised generals who are now statues in Washington.""

John nodded, sipping his coffee. ""Pretty much. They've got me flagged as 'classified consultant'—high clearance, mysterious background, good at strategy. They don't ask too many questions because my results speak for themselves.""

""But your fingerprints crashed a police database!"" Alex protested, remembering Chapter 7. ""The Commissioner groveled! How does the Pentagon not know?""

John grinned. ""Different systems, man. The cops flagged me as 'do not engage'—some Cold War thing from when I did black ops in the '50s. Pentagon just sees 'consultant with high clearance.' They assume I'm ex-CIA or something. I don't correct them.""

Alex wanted to flip the table. ""So you're just... what, gaslighting the entire U.S. government?""

John laughed, a deep, genuine sound. ""Gaslighting's a strong word. I prefer 'maintaining operational security.' And hey, they get good advice, I get to keep my hobbies. Win-win.""

""YOUR HOBBIES?!"" Alex's voice hit dolphin frequency again. ""You're running a trillion-dollar empire, advising the Pentagon, and you call it HOBBIES?!""

John shrugged, finishing his toast. ""What else would you call it? I like staying busy. Keeps life interesting.""

Alex buried his face in his hands. ""You're insane.""

""Probably,"" John said cheerfully. ""Want more coffee?""

# The Next Day's Denial

The next morning, John acted like nothing had happened. He made pancakes—some sourdough starter he'd probably been cultivating since the Renaissance—and hummed what Alex now recognized as a Revolutionary War march.

The ruby still sat on the coffee table, now doubling as a paperweight for what looked like actual Pentagon briefing notes. Alex stared at it, wondering if the ruby was judging him for not stealing it and running to the Smithsonian.

""So,"" Alex ventured, clutching his coffee mug like a life preserver, ""the Pentagon briefing. What are you going to tell them?""

John flipped a pancake with the precision of a man who'd probably cooked for Napoleon's army. ""Oh, you know, standard stuff. Drone swarm tactics, AI integration for logistics, maybe throw in some counter-insurgency strategies I've been toying with. Keep it professional.""

""Counter-insurgency strategies you've been 'toying with,'"" Alex repeated, his voice hollow. ""Like you're playing with LEGO.""

John grinned, sliding a perfect stack onto a plate. ""Strategy's just problem-solving, Alex. Move pieces, anticipate the opponent, adapt. Whether it's chess or warfare, the principles are the same.""

""Chess doesn't involve PEOPLE DYING.""

""Fair point,"" John conceded, pouring syrup with the ease of someone who'd probably invented breakfast. ""But the Pentagon knows that. They're careful with implementation. I just give them options.""

Alex opened his laptop, pulling up his spreadsheet.

**Sheet: ""Evidence of Immortality""**  
New entry: *Four-star General Kessler (U.S. Army, retired) personally requested John present ""military works"" to Pentagon. Military thinks he's mortal ""prodigy,"" unaware of centuries of service. Called him ""Patton of our generation."" Kessler mentioned Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, black ops. John admits to Gulf War (1991), Kandahar (2008?), Cold War black ops (1950s).*

**Sheet: ""Deflections/Excuses""**  
New entry: *""Just a consultant."" ""Pentagon loves PowerPoint."" ""I don't correct them."" ""Want more eggs?"" (Chapter 13)*

**Sheet: ""Food Bribes""**  
New entry: *Scrambled eggs (perfect), sourdough pancakes (pending consumption).*

Alex stared at the spreadsheet, his three tabs now totaling **65 entries**. Sixty-five. And John still hadn't admitted a damn thing.

He closed the laptop, ate his pancakes—which were, predictably, divine—and added ""gaslighting the U.S. military"" to his mental list of John's cosmic crimes.

# The Immortal General's Charade

The ruby glowed faintly on the coffee table, now holding down what Alex recognized as actual classified Pentagon documents (how John got those home, Alex didn't want to know). Excalibur leaned against the couch, probably reminiscing about the time it carved through Macedonian phalanxes.

Alex's mind raced. The Pentagon thought John was mortal. A prodigy. They had no idea they were asking a guy who'd fought in the Civil War, advised Eisenhower, and probably taught Sun Tzu how to write *The Art of War* to present ""military works"" like he was some Stanford grad with a good LinkedIn profile.

It was the most elaborate con in human history, and John was pulling it off with flannel shirts and pancakes.

The rent was still cheap. Merlin's cookies were still in the fridge. And John was still the most infuriating, enigmatic, deflection-champion billionaire immortal military genius roommate in the history of Brooklyn.

Alex wasn't moving out. Not yet. But if the next visitor was George Patton's ghost asking John for pointers, or General Mattis calling him ""sir,"" he was grabbing Excalibur, the ruby, and Bill Kessler's phone number—because clearly, the general knew more than he was letting on, and Alex needed allies in this cosmic gaslighting campaign.

For now, he ate his pancakes—perfect, damn it—and waited for someone, anyone, to finally confirm what he already knew.

The evidence was suffocating. But John? Still wouldn't crack.",1,1762895159.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

Context: Healthy early 20's male, no medical history outside of back pain, very fit (still), weightlift 3x per week for several years with no lapses, BMI of 21.6 (I know it's not a good standard but for general populations it's a decent indicator), 13% body fat, junk food no more than 2x per week, only drinking 2 cups of coffee and at a minimum 2 liters of water per day, job involves sitting all day.

NOTE: I can perform any lift, run for any distance (ran 7 miles the other day with no problems whatsoever), and sleep with zero back pain. Pain is literally only while sitting or driving.

Description of pain: At its worst, pain reaches 4/10 dull pain above the PSIS structures (see the pain location image), builds up from zero to 4/10 in about 10 minutes, never exceeds 4/10. Standing or doing any activity begins to reverse the pain, until a 0/10 is reached within 5-10 minutes.

  
About a year ago, I started to notice discomfort while sitting for more than three hours at a time. I started taking some breaks but still sat for extended periods of time. I went to chairopractor but adjustments never helped. 8 months ago the pain would come on with shorter periods of sitting. I bought a herman miller aeron and used it for two months, no improvement with pain. I also bought a standing desk which I use every day, without it I would be unable to do my job (significant improvement with pain management, just stand when back starts hurting and pain starts to go away). 5 months ago, pain would reach a 4/10 if I sat for more than 10 minutes. Of course it is impossible to avoid sitting for more than 10 minutes due to driving and any other scenario that requires sitting. I went to the hospital and was prescribed meloxicam and had an xray taken:

Xray findings by radiologist: No stenosis, no pars defect, no subluxation, no facet arthrosis, disc heights are intact; impression: unremarkable lumbar spine radiographs.

  
Changes after initial doctor visit: No more loading the spine with military press (120 lb for reps before), bench press (180 lb for reps before), no more running, switched to walking for 1 hr per day, no more squat, still lifted weights but only weights that didn't load the spine at all, still went to gym 3x per week to keep the habit.

The meloxicam almost entirely eliminated the pain for the duration of the pills. In the meantime, I did physical therapy, which consisted of back extensions (cobra pose), sets of ten every hour or two. As soon as the meloxicam ran out (30 days), the pain was back. After 6 weeks of physical therapy, I got a lumbar spine MRI, with and without contrast, which is included in the post.

MRI findings by radiologist: Alignment appears normal. Lumbar vertebral body heights are normally maintained. No marrow edema or focal marrow replacing lesion. No pathologic enhancement of the osseous structures.  
The conus terminates normally at the L1-L2 level. Cauda equina roots appear normal. No pathologic enhancement of the cauda equina. No epidural mass or fluid collection.  
Disc heights and signal appear normally maintained. Level by level details:  
T12-L1: No disc abnormality, canal stenosis, or foraminal stenosis.  
L1-L2: No disc abnormality, canal stenosis, or foraminal stenosis.  
L2-L3: No disc abnormality, canal stenosis, or foraminal stenosis.  
L3-L4: No disc abnormality, canal stenosis, or foraminal stenosis.  
L4-L5: No disc abnormality, canal stenosis, or foraminal stenosis.  
L5-S1: No disc abnormality, canal stenosis, or foraminal stenosis.  
Visualized paraspinal and retroperitoneal tissues are unremarkable.  
Impression: Normal lumbar spine MRI

The doctor prescribed cyclobenzaprine 5mg and stated that the issue is entirely muscular based on imaging.

Cyclobenzaprine did nothing for the back pain, only made me tired. Physical therapist reintroduced lumbar flexion once we found out the issue was not disc related (according to the MRI), as well as bird dogs, dead bugs etc. I also started doing isometric roman chair holds and eventually back extensions (from the low back ability youtube channel), zero pain while doing any of the above physical therapy exercises.

I slowly began to get better with no meds whatsoever. Reached a point where I could sit for hours about a month ago with little to no pain all day. Once the pain really started to subside, I reintroduced low weight squats (just the bar - 45lb), deadlift (low weight - 25 lb kettle bells), no pain while doing any of those exercises but I kept the weight low to be on the safe side. Also started running again, 5 miles once or twice per week. No pain while running, in fact I felt like it reduced my pain on the drive to the trail, no running on hard surfaces to avoid any potential issues with joint damage (no pain associated with running previously, wanted to avoid any new sources of pain).

Then after sitting for hours daily again, including a few road trips, the pain came back, now I'm back to a 4/10 when sitting for more than 10 minutes.

  
My question to everyone is, what could possibly be causing this and how can I permanently resolve it? Are there any anatomical structures that could cause this type of pain? I find it hard to believe that it's just a muscular imbalance that caused this, since it has lasted for so long and muscle relaxants did nothing for the pain. Again, I get absolutely no pain while doing any physical activity, I can swim for miles, run for miles, lift weights, and perform any active activity with absolutely zero problems or pain. It is literally only sitting that causes back pain.

1oulfqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1oulfqw/poor_bastard_need_good_coffee/,"Poor Bastard, Need Good Coffee","Hi all,

I'm a poor (and cheap) bastard looking to improve my coffee. I've been waiting for Black Friday to make some purchases.

**Current setup:**

* Pre-ground supermarket coffee (Ueshima House Blend is my favourite)
* Brewed in a steel cafetiere for 20 minutes (I know this is way longer than recommended, but for some reason I prefer it this way)
* I drink it black with one sugar per cup
* I never make espresso or anything fancy

I don’t know much about coffee, but based on James’ videos, I think the biggest upgrade would be getting a burr grinder so I can start grinding my own beans, starting with supermarket beans and later exploring freshly roasted ones.

He seemed quite impressed with the KINGrinder, and I found the P0 model for £22. Would this work well, or is it inadequate for brewing consistently good coffee at that price point? I can't afford anything much more expensive.

I’m also looking at a cheap (£6) digital scale to help with consistency, is this overkill?

Any other recommendations for cheap tools that could improve my coffee would be appreciated!

Thanks.",1,1762894961.0,JamesHoffmann,12,0.57,False

I hope this finds you well. Lately, I have discovered a pattern in regards to almost every RP I have ever done. I really enjoy playing as the antagonist in RPs, from almost any genre. I am happy to play as a stereotypical villain from a superhero comic, a serial killer, or a “yandere.”

  
I will list below a few prompts and samples of my writing. If you guys have any suggestions, please PM me! I can’t guarantee that I’ll be into the suggestion, but I’d still love to hear them out! I can RP as any gender, by the way.

  
Here are a few of my writing samples. 

Prompt one:  ''OFFICE YANDERE!''

Tom and Lucas worked on the twelfth floor of a nondescript office tower downtown—rows of desks. It was the kind of office where birthdays meant grocery-store sheet cakes in the breakroom and HR sent passive-aggressive emails about fridge cleanliness every Friday. Tom sat only two rows away from Lucas's glass-walled corner office. Lucas was Tom's boss; he would leave the door open just so he got to see Tommy. Tom's desk was cluttered with potted succulents, novelty pens, and a family photo mug that never left his hand. The mug featured a cheerful photo of his wife and two kids on vacation, all sunburnt and grinning. Lucas couldn't stop looking at it.



Tom was, frankly, a dork. The office kind. He had a dad bod and wore socks with cartoon sandwiches on them. He told groan-worthy jokes in meetings. Tom was... lovable, to say the least... He brought in banana bread for no reason. He was unfailingly kind, unfailingly positive, and unfailingly helpful. Always smiling. Always offering to stay late. Always asking, ""Need a hand with that?""



Lucas hated that Tom was married. It was a cruel, twisted joke—like some cosmic punishment he couldn't escape.



Prompt 2 : ''The tyrannical king.''

The doors creaked open, leading to the throne room.



She entered—slowly, methodically. Each step landed with a dull thud. Her spine curled like an old tree branch, twisted and bent.



Despite his disdain for nearly everyone, King Steven had a strange fondness for the crooked cook. Perhaps it was her refusal to cower, or the way she looked at him—not with fear, but with the weary contempt

""Y-You summoned me, Your Majesty?""

The old hag croaked the words like a question she'd asked too many times in too many lifetimes.



Lord Hephaestus did not rise. He didn't need to.

""Well now,"" he murmured, the corner of his mouth lifting with dark amusement. ""You stitched yourself something new, didn't you?""

His eyes dragged slowly down the patchwork fabric clinging to her crooked frame.

Her dress...Uneven, clearly hand-sewn. A peasant's work.

Willow lowered her head. Her hair fell in tired strands over her face, trying to hide the twitch in her jaw.

  
Prompt 3 ''Hostage''

Later that evening, Edward stepped inside, the familiar scent of Roy's home—wood and leather. Edward took the glass, swirling it for a moment before taking a sip. The taste was exquisite.

""So, how's work been?"" Roy asked, casually settling into an armchair across from him.

""Same as it's always been,"" Edward said, smiling softly. Edward added, ""I noticed something... Is the plumbing in your house okay? I mean, I've been smelling something... a little off? Could be coming from the pipes or something.""

Roy's smile didn't falter. He leaned back in his chair, looking almost amused.

""Rot?"" Roy repeated. ""We've had a bit of moisture in the basement recently—pipes can get a little musty down there...""

Edward nodded.

As the night went on, the taste of the wine started to lose its charm, and a faint dizziness crept up his spine. Roy, still watching him, leaned forward, his elbows resting on his knees.

""How's that wine treating you, Eddy? Feeling good?""

Edward wiped his forehead with the back of his hand. ""Roy... I think I need to—""

But before Edward could finish his sentence, the room seemed to sway again.

Roy didn't say anything at first. He simply leaned back in his chair, his smile widening just slightly, as though he were savoring something.

""Take it easy, Eddy,"" Roy said, his voice low and almost... soothing?

The words echoed in Edward's head like a warning, but he couldn't focus enough to make sense of them. His limbs felt heavy, his head too light.

Slowly, with the faintest flicker of dread, he realized something was terribly wrong.

Edward tried to push himself to his feet, but his body felt unresponsive. He reached out, fumbling for the edge of the coffee table to steady himself, but it seemed to drift just out of reach.

Edward's breath hitched in his chest.

1oulczk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poker_Theory/comments/1oulczk/first_time_poster_long_time_reader/,First time poster long time reader,"Top of the morning! I don't normally post my bad beats or even talk about them but today was a different kind of monster. I've been playing poker off and on for about 18 years, won some big, lost some big its been a back and forth. Play mostly online these days, and have had the same win some lose some experience until the last few weeks. I usually play on GGpoker and was playing on the $100 buy in tables and a couple $25+ tournaments. While I get that to some people money is no object, the consistently bad beats I've had lately are insane on the platform. 

This morning I was on the button chip lead (bought in for $100 was sitting on about $350), dealt 8d8c raise to 8BB as there were lots of fish at the table and 4 others had already limped. SB folds, BB calls and the rest of the limpers fold. For reference the BB caller stats are VPIP 8% 3-bet 1% ATS 0% 

Flop comes: 3d 8h 2s

I open with a pot bet 21BB, BB reraises to 40BB. So with top set and a rainbow board I jam all-in figuring he hit a smaller set. Villain turns over 6c7c so they need runner runner 4,5 5,9 or 9,10  with no flush draw. Ofc as per GG the turn and river come 5s, 9h. One of the others at the table shows their 5c5h pocket pair so there was only 5s 5d left in the deck. I've heard lots of talk about bots on the platform lately and thought it was people blaming or making excuses, but then I went thru my bad beats over the last few weeks and started noticing a pattern.

The pattern: When I joined the table I quickly took control, punished limpers with weak hands, raised the strong ones, trapped when I hit the nuts, everything was going great. As soon as i tripled up i started losing, slowly but constantly, my top pair losing to two pair with cards that should have never seen a flop for the amount, straight flops getting outdone by runner runner flush draws or higher straight connections. After some up and down I finally get the hand I said above and play it hard for the value, who wouldn't? Based on the players style they likely had a higher pocket pair then myself or AxXx of some sorts as the entire time they sat at the table they didn't play anything else other then AxXx or pocket 9s or better. Yet when I catch them out like that they always seem to run out and cut me.

Further evidence to this: 3 days ago was playing at the same level: $100 buy in. I get dealt Ah10h, raise to 12bb on the cutoff and get 1 caller the UTG+1. I had about 300BBs in my stack and the villian has 140BBs. Sorry I can't remember villians stats.

Flop comes 9h 8h 7s

Boom top flush, i'm doing my happy dance and I have priority. Villain bets 20BB and I reraise to 50BB. Turn comes 5h. I'm literally crapping my pants as the only cards that can do any damage at this point is 7h6h. Villian jams for their remaining stack (which I have covered) and I call. UTG turns over 6h, 2s. I'm cheering, this is free, their only out is 7h, why in the world would anyone call or bet against someone that was showing such strength. Of course, river card 7h. I couldn't believe it, runner runner straight flush... on with a 6h2s. I don't know a single player on the planet that would call any reraise on that flop with such a terrible hand. Boom almost half my stack gone. I get my cooler freebie, go grab a coffee, calm a minute and change tables. New table I get pocket Ks out of the gate and call the small stack all in pre flop and hit 200BB quickly. 

Here comes the next absolutely unbelievable runner runner luck. Hero has AsKs UTG, raises to 10bb, it folds all the way around to the button that reraises to 20bb, so ofc hero calls.

Flop comes: 2d Kc Qh

Hero bets 40bb, Villain reraises all in, hero calls. Villain turns over JcJd. Kh on the turn, and then Js on the river... Sb shows a Jh which clocked up to my 3rds loss to a single out after being up in the same day.

My cousin and I work at the same company. She’s a junior developer coming back from maternity leave next month. We met for coffee recently, and when I asked how she felt about returning, she said it wouldn’t be much different since she’s not planning to have anyone watch the baby or send him to daycare.

It honestly caught me off guard. Our company expects employees (even remote ones) to have full-time childcare. Cameras are required for meetings, and we all come into the office a few times a month. I just don’t see how that will realistically work with a newborn, and I worry she might be setting herself up for a really stressful experience.

She has family nearby but isn’t comfortable letting anyone else care for him right now. I completely understand the hesitation — it’s hard to trust someone with your baby, especially that young — but I also don’t want to see her burn out or get in trouble at work.

Would you say something gently before she comes back, or stay quiet and let her navigate it on her own?

1oulawm,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1oulawm/drinking_herbal_teas/,Drinking herbal teas ?,"Good afternoon,

So curious what do you guys think about drinking herbal teas while on carnivore diet. I know I know - only beef salt and water but... I am currently trying to get absolutely clean, so some weeks ago I quit smoking ( up to 2 boxes a day ), coffee (10-15 up espressos a day - not even exaggerating ) and alcohol, which I'd drink 1-2 times a week. It's been like 3 weeks and honestly my life seems to be flat / dull, with sudden and intense pangs of cravings for all the crap I quit.I do not have carbs cravings tho as I have been 85-95% carnivore for around a year already ( if we don't count that alcohol in ). 

I realize it will take probably up to several months for my body to come back to 'normal' and feel normal / energetic / enthusiastic but really man my life rn is so colorless that I need that hit of warm herbal tea several times a day, which at least help me battle caffeine addiction, since it' the same ritual as it was with coffee.

1oul8pa,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1oul8pa/my_partners_sibling_told_me_about_their_past/,My partners sibling told me about their past experiences with men and it shattered my view of her.,"My partner and I have been together for about 4.5 years. It started off casual, but about two years in, things became serious and we decided to move in together. Since then, our relationship has continued to grow beautifully. We work really well as a team, and honestly, we’re best friends. It might sound corny, but that means a lot to me.

About two years ago, my partner got into a heated argument with one of their siblings over a family issue. It was intense. I could tell my partner was extremely stressed, pacing, typing furiously, and just not themselves. About an hour later, I got a message from the sibling claiming my partner had cheated on me—with multiple people at once. (Avoiding the word that might get this flagged, but hopefully you understand what I mean.)

I immediately showed my partner the message. They broke down crying and loosely explained the situation. I didn’t take the accusation too seriously at the time since the sibling wasn’t very trustworthy, and I truly didn’t believe my partner could do something like that.

For a while, I tried to brush it off, but intrusive thoughts started creeping in. I’d picture the message, imagine what might’ve happened, and start spiraling. It became obsessive. At work or at home, I’d suddenly get a rush of adrenaline and this sick feeling in my stomach. It wasn’t a great way to see someone you love. I kept it to myself for about a year, and it really ate away at me.

Eventually, my partner told me the full story. everything from start to finish. After hearing it, I actually felt relieved knowing there was no cheating involved. But at the same time, something shifted. I was shocked, almost disgusted. My image of them shattered a bit. I started to lose respect, to resent them for their past, and to hate myself for feeling that way about someone I deeply love.

After doing some research, I realized I was likely dealing with retroactive jealousy along with other psychological struggles tied to seeing my partner differently after learning more about their past.

I can honestly say this is one of the hardest things I’ve ever gone through. It’s affected our sex life and emotional connection. Sometimes I feel detached and can’t stop intrusive images or thoughts. There are even moments at work where the thoughts hit so hard that my legs feel weak.

I’ve started to look into therapy to try to understand and manage what I’m feeling, because I don’t want this. I don’t want to resent my partner or let these thoughts ruin something good. I love them deeply
 and just want peace in my own mind again. 

Part of me knows that this will pass and it will get better. Part of me pours creamer in my coffee wondering if one day I’ll be leaving quietly. 

I’m unsure if this post works here, what to expect, or even what to ask. I’ve recently gotten into journaling and writing my thoughts down. This might just me trying that out in a new way. ",1,1762894528.0,offmychest,3,1.0,False

I’m on week 5 and I’m starting to worry the diarrhea isn’t going to ever level out. I’ve been managing with pepto and lots of bananas, completely cut out coffee, etc., but I want to know if it ever gets better on its own…

Anyone have experience with this? I would decrease my dose but needed to go up due to my anxiety and OCD getting so much worse recently.

I met this woman she was 50 at the time. Physically I was really attracted to her and thought there was potential. The first time we met was at a restaurant, things went well we seemed to like each other so we agreed to meet up again. The second time seeing her she invited me to her place and said we'll just hang out and watch movies she would fix dinner and have a nice evening. I was like sounds good to me. I get to her place and one of the first things she said was I made us some appetizers but my dog ate them because she sat them on the coffee table, she said he never does that I don't know what got into him. I was like..... well um ok. So that's how we began our late afternoon hang out. She went on to tell me that she cooks for her dog like eggs was one of the things she fed it a lot..... I'm like alrighty then. She then went on to say when she was with her ex when they got frisky in the bedroom the dog was in the room too and it started to get involved somehow. 🤢 We played a couple movies but we really wasn't get into it and watch em that much because she kept talking to her dog during the movies. She said to it now quit pouting and get over here and watch movies with us. She said the dog was pouting cuz it was jealous that I was there. I'm going to say she talked more to the dog more than she did me. So at this point it's a real turn off and I'm starting to ​see the writing on the wall. 

This was during the colder months so I brought a pair of shorts that change in so I could be more comfortable since I was going to be at her place for several hours so I used her bathroom to change into my shorts and my mistake was I left my pants on her bathroom floor. When it was time for me to leave I went into change back into my pants to find out that her dog pissed on them. She said yeah he did that on purpose to show you that I belong to him and to try to show dominance over you. And she's like I'm never getting rid of my dog. I'm like all right you have a good one and take care.........

Someone has to do them, and really nothing feels better then a nice, clean apartment. Now I am just settled in with a cup of coffee, relaxing for the rest of the day. So what better chance to post and see what I can find! I am always looking for new people to talk with, everyone is unique and interesting in their own ways. 

A bit about myself to start things off: 

* Live in Canada (MST timezone) and work as an accountant. I am quite left leaning, and while I can get along with most people, I do not tolerant any hateful or bigoted thinking \* For my freetime, you will mostly find me hanging out with online friends, gaming, reading, or watching something like Youtube, Animes, or TV shows. Game wise I have been playing Hades 2, EU5, Dwarf Fortress, WoW, FFXIV, and Rimworld lately. Honestly just play anything I enjoy and am not locked too much in genres. 
* Have recently gotten back into curling as well. Played it as a teenager but find myself enjoying it much more now. Probably has something to do with not being a moody, impatient teenager anymore. Keep bruising my knee though so need more practice on that
* Music is also a big part of my life. Just so much easier to express my thoughts and feelings through songs. I would say Alternative and Indie rock are some of my preferred genres, but if I hear something and like it I will add it to my playlist. I am always down for sharing song recommendations and sharing/making playlists to swap! 
* Recently have been trying to learn how to do some photography to help better capture the views I see. It's... going as best as it can with an older digital camera, but hey, it is getting me or out and about. 
* I do have interest in subjects such as geography, geology, and history. I like just pulling open a map, picking a random spot, and seeing what I can learn about it. I do have interests in other things as well, those are just a few I have always had a stronger focus on. 

With all that said, really I can just message/talk about anything. I am quite an open book, and there are very few topics I am uncomfortable with, and when I am I make it known. I am open to getting to know just about anyone, just as long as you are a decent person.",1,1762894256.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

This is my first Reddit post so I am not really sure entirely how this works, but I could use some advice. For the first time in my life, I am really struggling making new friends. I (F25) have always had a close group of girls, but I have moved far away for my fiances (M22) job. 

Some important info is that we now live close to my finances family, who I love and get along with fantastically. But I only have him and his family here that I feel I can hangout with. I just want someone here who I can have a girls day with. 

I consider myself lucky that I have a best friend from childhood that I still talk to every single day. However, she is now over 5 hours away since I have moved and can only see each other once a month, so I would like to make good friends in this new place. 

Here is where the real issue is. I am not sure if it is just me that is the problem, but I can’t seem to make friends here. In college it was so easy making new friends, I barely had to try. Now, I work from home so it’s difficult to find other girls to make friends with. 

I even joined the church nearby and have been involved, volunteering, going to events, and in a small group. I just don’t feel like I fit in there. My jokes aren’t landing, people don’t come up to me, and I just feel all around awkward for the first time in years. I thought church would be the safest place to make good friends, but I’ve never felt more rejected. 

I’ve asked three different girls to get coffee three different times. Two of them just canceled without ever rescheduling and the third just used to time to try to sell me a product. 


This has been a real blow to my self esteem, I have to admit. As I mentioned before, it’s never been difficult for me to make friends until here. My fiancé is having similar issues and has said that he always found it hard to make friends in this area until he moved away for school (where we met). I am not sure if it is just because it’s a wealthier neighborhood so people are more stuck up, or if I have run out of places to fit in.

I know this sounds silly or drastic, but I have seriously never felt lonelier or more rejected. Any advice or similar experiences to relate to would be much appreciated. Thank you to anyone who has read my post. If nothing else, it feels good to get it all out there.

Background

We had been together for years, married. Things weren’t perfect, but normal.
Everything changed the moment she started a new job.


---

Timeline

November 21
She comes home after her first day at a new job and casually mentions there’s “a very attractive guy” working there.

November 22
Out of nowhere she says she wants to go for coffee with him.
No explanation. I don’t understand what’s happening.

November 23–30
She falls into an intense crush:

crying

denying it

confused

but eventually accepting her feelings


During this week she deletes our photos from Instagram.

She was 21, he was 23.


---

December 1–14

She calms down slightly but keeps wavering:
me or him.
She says she doesn’t know what she wants.


---

December 21 — the turning point

She goes to a work Christmas party. I’m out of town.
They drink, dance, he touches and kisses her.
She goes home with him.
They have oral sex.


---

December 22–30

After the affair she becomes:

cold

defensive

critical of me

ready to leave for him


But I and her parents pressure her to stay, so she doesn’t leave yet.


---

January–June

Half a year of emotional chaos.

She swings back and forth: wants to be with me, then doesn’t.

Keeps talking to him the whole time.

Goes to the theater with him, walks around with him.

In March–April it looks like things are finally stabilizing… but the communication continues.

He keeps chasing her and asking her out.



---

May–June

I travel again, and she crashes emotionally again.
She says she doesn’t love me and sees no future with me.
This lasts until July 3.


---

July 3

I let her go.
She moves in with him.

It's been 4 months, I'm working on myself, I've crossed her out of my life, but I still can't get rid of the feeling of injustice. I want them to get some kind of punishment for their actions.

I think the suggestions people get on this forum are often amazing and I would so appreciate some fresh perspectives on a room that’s looking quite tired to me.

Any advice for my living room? 
Questions I’m pondering:

-Should I add or move furniture? 
-Should I add any furniture along the side of the room that has nothing in it? Sometimes I think about an arm chair in the corner, or low bookshelves, but I don’t want to clutter the room. 
-Should I get a new coffee table? What material, color, shape, or texture? 
-Since I have a photo gallery on the wall over the couch, should I make the wall opposite have two larger pieces of art? One on each side of the door to the sunroom? 
-I previously had a dark blue rug with bold pattern, but the room feels dark a lot of the day. I’m not sure what I might like instead. The previous rug was a 9x12 rectangle that took up most of the floor. 
-What should I consider in terms of lighting? I have a table lamp and a ceiling fixture and some recessed lights that I rarely turn on because they are rather harsh. I love cozy layers of lighting but I’m not sure how to achieve it. 
-Any suggestions on color palette to tie the room together?

More info: 
-Replacing the couches is not possible right now. They are a neutral gray. 
-The walls are a light, warm, gray. 
-The connected kitchen, which you can’t see, has white cabinets and a gray island. 
-The floors are a warm, cherry color hardwood. 
-I love eclectic, maximalist spaces with lots of bold color, but my husband prefers neutral and minimalist spaces. He’s very adaptable to most things I’d want to try, but when we go shopping together, we tend to end up with very safe pieces. But there’s a lot of room to invest in statement pieces or in interesting details.

In the beginning, she was the dominant one. She made the first move — touching, kissing, everything. She loved me like crazy. She promised me marriage, even said we’d do a court marriage soon just to make things sure between us. That’s how intense her love was.

But after 6 months, everything changed. Out of nowhere, she said her feelings were gone — like they never existed. I still don’t understand how that’s possible. She made me fall deeply in love, and then just… walked away. I went through a really dark, traumatic phase — but she didn’t seem to care.

Her so-called best friend (let’s call her ‘XYZ’) — I had never even talked to her during our relationship. But when everything fell apart, I called her once, just to say that if someday I got worried about my girlfriend, I might ask her how she’s doing. That’s it. No flirting, no intention. But she twisted everything. She told her boyfriend and my girlfriend that I asked her out for coffee, that I flirted with her. Because of that lie, her boyfriend slapped me in public. I didn’t even raise a finger back — not because I was weak, but because I knew that if I reacted, he’d drag my girlfriend’s name into it, and I couldn’t let that happen. So I stayed silent.

And after all this, my girlfriend chose her. She chose that same best friend over me — the one who lied, who caused all this. And now she’s even planning to meet those same people who once humiliated me, along with that best friend.

And believe me, this is just 1% of what I’ve been through. If you ever heard the full story — the other 99% — you’d wonder how I’m still standing, how I’m still alive after all that",1,1762893911.0,Advice,24,0.57,False

It is compact, measuring approximately 11.3 x 8.6 x 12.6 inches, making it suitable for countertops without taking much space, and it has a sleek stainless steel finish that adds to its modern aesthetic.

# Ice Quality and Production

This machine produces nugget ice, which is crunchy, chewable, and melts slower than traditional bullet or cube ice, preserving the flavor of drinks longer. It starts making ice quickly, with an output of about 7 oz of ice in 20 minutes and can produce enough ice for 3 to 5 drinks per hour, making it efficient for daily use and gathering occasions. The ice texture is well-liked for cocktails, iced coffee, or just chilled water.

# Design and Usability

The ice maker features a pull-out drawer-style ice bin with about 3 lbs of storage capacity, which allows easy access to ice without disrupting the ice-making process. It includes a handle for portability and comes with ice bags and a scoop to store ice easily in the refrigerator if not used immediately. The unit also has a slanted, easy-to-navigate touch screen for intuitive operation.

# Smart and Self-Cleaning Features

Ecozy’s model stands out with its self-cleaning function that circulates water to clean the machine thoroughly, ensuring fresh and healthy ice without the hassle of manual cleaning. It has smart controls available through an app, allowing users to monitor the ice-making process, receive alerts when the ice bin is full or water is low, and start ice production remotely. These features add significant convenience, especially for frequent use and entertaining.

# Portability and Versatility

Weighing around 20 pounds, it is easy to move for use in different settings such as the kitchen counter, bars, camping trips, or RVs. Its compact footprint and quiet operation make it suitable for both indoor and outdoor use.

# Overall Impression

In a world where convenience is king, crypto is finally catching up — and leading the charge are **Bitcoin BTMs** and the **free** [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) app. Forget fumbling with long wallet addresses or mistyping one of those 34-character crypto strings that look like alien license plates. The future is fast, scannable, and oh-so-simple.

Let’s start with **Bitcoin BTMs** — the crypto world’s answer to ATMs. These sleek machines let anyone buy or sell Bitcoin using good old-fashioned cash or a debit card. Just scan your wallet’s QR code, insert cash, and boom — Bitcoin zaps into your wallet faster than you can say “to the moon.” Some BTMs even let you sell Bitcoin and walk away with crisp bills in seconds. They’re popping up in convenience stores, gas stations, and shopping malls across the world, making crypto feel as familiar as grabbing a coffee.

But here’s the catch — you need a way to quickly and safely show your wallet address when using these machines. That’s where the **free** [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) app steps in like a superhero with a laser scanner. Instead of manually typing your Bitcoin address, you can instantly turn it into a QR code that’s easy to scan at any Bitcoin ATM (BTM), on any website, or even from your own printed label or business card.

It’s not just convenient — it’s secure. When you use the Bitcoin QR Code Maker, you’re reducing the chance of sending your BTC to the wrong address (ouch). Copy-paste errors are the enemy of every crypto user, and QR codes eliminate them entirely. Just scan and go. Whether you’re paying, receiving, or just flexing your crypto smarts, a simple QR code keeps everything fast, frictionless, and error-free.

And did we mention it’s totally free? No sign-ups, no nonsense, no waiting. Just type in your Bitcoin address, click generate, and your unique QR code appears — ready to download, print, or share. It’s the perfect companion for anyone using Bitcoin BTMs, Bitcoin payment buttons, or even running a crypto-friendly store.

Imagine this: you walk into a local shop that accepts Bitcoin. You whip out your phone, open your QR code, and the cashier scans it. Transaction complete. No middlemen, no third parties, just pure peer-to-peer magic. The same goes for BTMs — scan, confirm, and your crypto is moving in seconds.

So whether you’re a die-hard Bitcoin believer, a merchant accepting your first BTC payment, or just someone curious about how these mysterious BTMs work, it’s time to level up your crypto life.

Try the [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) today, and next time you pass a Bitcoin BTM, you’ll be ready to scan, send, and stack sats like a pro.

After all, Bitcoin was built to make money simple — and now, thanks to QR codes and BTMs, it finally feels that way. 🚀",1,1762893786.0,u_SelectionOptimal7348,0,1.0,False

TL;DR: Please help me choose between zp6 and ode 2 or sth else I’m missing. Have a K6, brewing for a year but looking to upgrade. Usage: 90% pourover 10% espresso. Ok with keeping my K6 for espresso. Budget is max 500€

And the long story: I started my pour over journey last year with the v60, origami and the clever with a bit of aeropress here and there. 
At the time I got a K6 as my starter since I read everywhere that its kind of unbeatable value (paid 80€ on black friday) and wasn’t sure if I won’t miss my lattes and didn’t wanna spend too much.

A year later and I’m really enjoying brewing over espresso, much more peaceful, harder to mess up, all the good things. But I still make a latte here and there and specially for my partner. (Also using the K6 and a picopresso)

But, I’ve been wanting to upgrade my grinder for pour over, since the K6 still does a good enough job with my picopresso. 

I can’t seem to decide between the zp6 and the ode 2, and I see really good reviews from both. I’ve had coffee made by the ode 2 and loved it, never tried the zp6. I think I like tea like brews and brews with more body, so cant decide based on that. I love well rounded cups and I enjoy flavor separation. so that also doesnt help. I do have some worries about fellow’s longevity, I see people having them for years with no problem, and I see a lot of complains. 

Also, I do have a budget of max 500€ so can’t get both either. Can I please ask for some advice? Is there another grinder I’m missing?
I also live in Belgium so not everything is the easiest to get (to my knowledge) like the a4z. 

I would really really appreciate some help and a hand to get me out of this rabbit hole. Thank you so much in advance and sorry for this long post!

Got to the starting corral, used the portaloo five times before the start and then chugged down another gatorade and chewed on a salt tablet. Started the race feeling fine but I was worryingly close to Zone 3. By mile 2 I was feeling an urgent need to urinate yet again. There was no way I was letting go of a sub-3 so I relieved myself while running, in the time-honoured way. Unfortunately this did not solve the problem and I was subjected to a constant dribble of yellow salty piss with every step for the next ten miles (six hours in). Chafing and starting to hallucinate, I made it to a paramedic who offered me a lifesaving Gu. Unfortunately by this time my damp, salty shorts had rendered the situation tragically unboofable.

It’s causing me to be very tired. Normally I would be fine because I could do feeds with my feeding tube but it is unfortunately not usable right now. I can only do bolus feeds. And that is impossible to do at work and makes me very sick when I do it too fast. 

So my current food fixations are Jello cups, tater tots, and chobani flips. That’s pretty much all I’m having besides coffee in the morning, lots of water during the day and sometimes lemonade, and sleepy time tea before bed. 

I did however cook my patient some egg salad and tuna salad. And I had to taste them to make sure they were right and they were both very good. It’s funny I am a very good cook but I don’t really like food. So I’m going to get the ingredients to make those and make them at home. Then I’ll try to eat them and I hope I can because they were really good at my patients home. 

I am luckily getting my feeding tube fixed on Thursday so that will be really helpful then I can keep eating little bits these things and doing feeds. Then I won’t be so tired. 

So usually it doesn’t really matter what my fixations are and how limited they are because I can do feeds but in the meantime till my feeding tube gets fixed this is very frustrating. 

Despite being so tired I am still working 31hours a week 7days a week. I love my job. Sometimes it feels like it’s the only thing that makes me happy besides my bunny and my family. ",1,1762893244.0,ARFID,1,1.0,False
1oukn3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1oukn3v/is_this_controlling_behavior/,Is this controlling behavior?,"Hi everyone,

I (F33) have been dating my partner (M32) for about 4 months. Things are mostly good — he’s intelligent, funny, and we have strong emotional connection — but there have been a number of small situations that made me feel uncomfortable or slightly controlled. I’d love some perspective on whether this is normal or concerning.

For example:

When we were on a trip together, he got upset that a male friend texted me daily. He said it was “disrespectful” for someone to message me while I was with him. I told him I decide who I talk to, and that nothing inappropriate was going on. He later said it would also bother him if it was a female friend, since I’m bisexual.

He criticized one of my female friends after I shared a completely neutral story about her. He said if she’s really my close friend, “it can’t mean anything good.”

One night, when he was sick and I couldn’t sleep because he was snoring, I said I’d go home to rest. He laughed and said, “I’ll lock the door so you can’t go.” He said it jokingly, but it didn’t feel funny to me. I ended up leaving anyway.

He often tells me when we’ll meet instead of asking. It feels like he’s deciding for both of us.

When we were both working, he asked me to do something for him even though I was clearly focused. When I said no, he repeated the request and seemed mildly irritated.

Another time, I asked if he could pick me up from work. He said he wanted to shower first, and when I said I’d come later, he questioned why I needed that long — as if my timing had to match his.

After a movie, I called to say I’d stop home quickly before going to his place. He said it was fine, but then kept telling me to hurry, even though there was no rush.

Recently, at his place, I wanted to make another coffee. He playfully blocked my way and said, “No, I forbid you.” I said, “I don’t let anyone forbid me anything.” He laughed and said it was for my own good because of caffeine, but later admitted he just wanted more time with me. It was playful, but felt off.

Once he told me to put my phone in my bag so it wouldn’t get stolen. When I said I’d rather keep it in my pocket, he said, “Listen to me when I tell you something.” That tone surprised me.

He’s not aggressive — he often smiles or frames these things as jokes — but I notice I get tense and feel like I have to defend my independence over small decisions.

I’d appreciate some outside perspective. Are these just small personality clashes, or do they suggest controlling tendencies?

TL;DR: My boyfriend sometimes acts in ways that make me feel subtly controlled or patronized. I’m not sure if I’m overreacting or if these are early red flags",20,1762893191.0,AskWomenOver30,98,0.69,False

He came into where I work a few months ago and he gave me the impression that he had some form of schizophrenia or mental disability. He was doing things like covering his ears looking all around him like somebody was coming for him, and he just acted kinda scared. 

It just seems very off putting to me. I just have a feeling that he's following me, but being in the presence of him covering his ears and acting that way is also making me think he just roams around town a lot.

There’s so much that I don’t even know where to begin. 

My partner and I were married for nearly 10 years I’m (35m) and she’s (33f). She wanted a divorce a couple of years ago and decided to move out and the reason was “you don’t hold my hand enough, you haven’t put music on my Spotify playlist in a long time and you don’t sit close to me on the couch as much” and things like that. 

We have kids and I always felt like i was a dedicated and loving husband and father: flowers every other week, homemade dinners, asking how I could help during her work week, planning dates, we both work full time but I’d always ensure she came home to a clean house, bathed kiddos, and a warm / loving home. 

After we were separated, she expressed how she had made a big mistake and took me for granted and wanted to get back together. 

I was overjoyed to have my wife back and we moved back in together… shortly after, things seemed to get even worse. 

She would constantly ask to go through my phone, to read all of my messages, accuse me of cheating, and I never was. 

Small things were all Massive arguments filled with criticism, content, anger, blame, etc 

I tried to work a small side business a couple of hours per week and she told me it was selfish and that I wasn’t prioritizing her. Even when I was doing love notes, flowers, homemade dinners, cleaning the house shirt work, taking kiddos to the park, getting them bathed before she was home, etc … 

If I spent 6 of 7 days a week with her and the kids after work, she still would be angry and tell me I was selfish if I tried to make plans for myself even for a long afternoon or to work at a coffee shop by myself for a bit. 

If we had a day with zero plans on the calendar, she said “just because there’s no plans on the calendar doesn’t mean it’s a free for all for you to do whatever you want!” 

We had a bunch of massive fights last year, and I filed for divorce. It was one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever made 

We’ve been divorced and living apart for nearly a year and I missed her like crazy. I still love her and reached out a few months ago to see if reconciliation or fixing our relationship was a potential possibility and she agreed and wanted to go to counseling with me. We’ve been seeing each other for a few months and have been in counseling…

A few weeks ago… we had a MASSIVE rupture over a small misunderstanding

We had made some plans to relax at her house with the kids and watch a movie but first I had some chores to do at my house. I was cleaning and called to check on her and the kids, she said something like “we’re just relaxing today if you wanted to make plans with friends” 

I said I know, and I’d let her know. I called my buddy to see if he wanted to get lunch and he said “we’re up north at the cabin! You haven’t seen it yet! Come up for a few hours”

It sounded fun for an afternoon, so I texted her and said “I was invited to friends cabin for a few hours, I’d love to see you guys still tonight on the way home and let’s go bowling or something tomorrow with the kids?” 

She was immediately upset and said “when I said make plans, I didn’t mean for a whole afternoon, I meant lunch! Go do whatever you want” and she said she didn’t want to see me later that evening or the following day 

I drove up north, called her to say I love you and she ignored my call. I texted in the evening and she ignored that too. 

I decided to sleep on the couch there after we watched a baseball game and left early the next morning. I called her that morning and she said needed space and wouldn’t “tolerate being treated the way I treat her and deserved so much better than what I give her” 

A few days later, she asked “did you sleep up there?” 

I said yes and she was enraged again. She said “you’re a liar! Why didn’t you tell me? You withheld information from me! You know I don’t like those friends! You didn’t even think about how I’d feel!” 

I said “you cut off all communication with me… I didn’t think it would make any difference where I slept that evening and I was just tired and didn’t feel like driving back into town” 

Didn’t matter. She was angry, kept calling me a liar, then said “I’m not comfortable with your friendship especially after you stayed the night up there. I don’t trust you, I need you to cut off this friendship completely or I’m leaving this relationship! If something makes your partner uncomfortable, you cut it off no question about it! If you cared this wouldn’t even be a hard decision for you!!” 

Because I didn’t agree to her ultimatum right then and there, she has cut off love, kindness, communication, affection, etc and said she doesn’t want to see me or “act normal like everything is okay” until I cut off this relationship with my friend 

I’m at a complete loss and feel like I’m constantly doing something wrong. I want to know what I’m not seeing? Any advice is greatly appreciated!! 

**TL;DR;** wife and I are divorced and trying to reconcile and become a healthier couple for ourselves and for our kids, but it feels like I live in a failure factory and no matter how small of a misunderstanding or disagreement we have, it can result in days and weeks of anger, resentment, disconnection, etc if I don’t agree to ultimatums and drop everything at a moments notice to fix things when she’s upset.

Six months later, I was broke and hiding from my family.","You know those Instagram stories you see? The ones with the laptop on a beach, the Shopify 'cha-ching' notifications, and the endless talk about 'financial freedom'? Yeah, I was living that dream. I quit my soul-crushing 9-to-5, poured my life savings into an e-commerce store, and for a glorious few months, it actually worked. The sales notifications on my phone were a constant buzz, a sweet dopamine hit that told me I'd made it. I was working 18-hour days fueled by cheap coffee and pure adrenaline, but I was my own boss. I felt like I had cracked the code.

Then, the notifications slowed down. At first, it was a quiet Tuesday, then a silent weekend. The steady stream of orders trickled to a drip, and then… nothing. The silence was deafening. I frantically tweaked my ad campaigns, redesigned the website, and dropped prices, but it was like shouting into a void. That feeling of being on top of the world curdled into a cold knot of dread in my stomach that just wouldn't go away. The same business that had been making five figures a month was now barely covering its hosting fees.

That's when the real crash happened. I started avoiding calls from my parents because I couldn't bear their 'I told you so' looks. I was racking up credit card debt just to keep the lights on, telling myself it was a temporary slump. Every morning I'd wake up with a jolt of anxiety, check my phone, and see a big fat zero in the sales column. I felt like an absolute fraud. I wasn't a cool entrepreneur anymore; I was just an unemployed guy with a garage full of inventory I couldn't sell.

It took hitting rock bottom to finally pull the plug. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done, admitting that I had failed. But here’s the thing they don't tell you in those 'get rich quick' courses: my failure taught me more than my success ever did. I learned about cash flow the hard way, about marketing beyond just throwing money at ads, and most importantly, I learned about resilience. It was the most expensive and painful education I've ever received, but I wouldn't trade it.

1ouk8ub,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusinessPH/comments/1ouk8ub/a_simple_coffee_break_turned_into_a_business/,A Simple Coffee Break Turned Into a Business Opportunity,"I was just at my usual coffee shop — a small place near my area that I visit almost every day to unwind from administrative work. I’ve become friends with the baristas there, and often strike up conversations with people around me. I believe that every person we meet can bring something valuable — not just for ourselves, but also for the people and organizations we’re part of.  
  
That day, something interesting happened. When I walked in, I noticed my barista friend sitting with someone I hadn’t seen before — an unfamiliar face in a place I visit daily. It turns out, before I arrived, my friend had already been telling this person about my business, IT Solutions.  
  
To my surprise, the stranger was a business owner. After a few minutes of conversation about what we do at BYI — web development, systems, and digital solutions — he expressed real interest in partnering with us.  
  
It made me think: What if I hadn’t gone to the coffee shop that day? What if I had decided to stay home instead?  
  
Moments like these remind me that some opportunities come from the most unexpected places. Whether it’s luck, timing, or simply being open to connect — you never know where the next big opportunity might come from.  
  
Stay curious. Stay open. And never underestimate a simple coffee break. ",2,1762892253.0,BusinessPH,1,0.75,False
1ouk8qh,https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/1ouk8qh/what_do_you_do_to_feel_connected_to_the_city/,What do you do to feel connected to the City?,"Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about what it means to belong to the city.

I’m in my late 40s and live about 30 minutes outside of downtown Pittsburgh. My family and I love the city; we go to the theaters, fleas, catch concerts, cheer at games, and try out new (to us) restaurants as often as we can. On most weeks, we’re in town at least once, often more.

And yet there’s still this feeling of being near the city, but not quite of it.

Maybe it’s because we haven’t yet found that right neighborhood where we can walk to grab a coffee, chat with a neighbor, or feel the hum of city life right outside the door.

We hope to make that move someday to a downtown-adjacent neighborhood that feels alive but still grounded. In the meantime, I’ve been pondering: what can I do now to feel more connected to Pittsburgh in a real, everyday way. 

We already go to events, support local restaurants, and keep up with what’s happening. But I’m curious — what else can help build that deeper sense of connection?

Is it getting involved in a neighborhood clean-up or volunteering for a city nonprofit? Joining a community board or urban garden? Spending more unstructured time — not for an event or a reservation, but just being there — walking the trails along the river, sitting in a café, or exploring a neighborhood I haven’t yet gotten to know?

I’d love to hear what’s worked for others, especially those who live just outside the city limits but feel deeply part of its rhythm.

How do you bridge that gap between visiting Pittsburgh and truly belonging to it?",9,1762892246.0,pittsburgh,32,0.7,False

*No videos of Joe at the gym were shared; no walking pad content was shared; no content was shared on Facebook showing Kylea on a walk to elevate her heart rate.

Final Thoughts

TMI about her diarrhea, nausea, and endometriosis flare.  Many hysterectomies are a quick day surgery and Kylea spends hours away from Birdie at concerts...Daily rage bait about Oliver being in the kitchen was UNnecessary. Why do I think she was heavy on the rage bait and sad fishing (aka emotional manipulation to increase engagement and profit)?  Kylea went to court on 10/15 for the protective orders against her and those she filed against former friends.  They will go to trial 02/05/26. Lawyers aren't free, and I highly doubt hers accepts $25 per month. ✌️

My Ex (25M) and I (26F) were kinda in a situationship but we were building towards a relationship. we were cuddling, kissing, hanging at each others houses, showing up for each other at events. Going to family events and holidays, Having fun with eachother like we’re together we just didn’t have that label just “yet.” So technically we weren’t “Official” and we were not in a “relationship” and that legit the only thing that is keeping me feeling sane right now. It’s more so an excuse for me not so for him. 

Our entire life circle knew about us, families friends and even both jobs all of our coworkers knew about us. Because we were together for 3 years prior to this and after a year later we found each other again. 

I just had trust issues but nothing bad truly ever happened. In the beginning I was the one who said I wanted to build towards a relationship for trust first before we just go straight into one again. That was in February. 

But since then our sex life wasn’t that great because we both had trouble communicating and opening up to each other to fully enjoy and we both have some insecurities. we’re always second guessing it so we never had sex it was all just kissing and cuddling, sleeping every night on phone or in person but we did have sex once a few months ago. However He is always there for me makes 100% effort and goes above and beyond, we go on so many fun dates and he is my bestfriend and makes me soo soo happy. We talk about anything and everything we know soo much about each other and I 100% saw a future with him. I helped him move into his new apartment and he made a big deal about starting fresh and with me because his old apartment was when we broke up. October 12th was my birthday and he made it sooo soo special it was the best day ever. And then October 18th we went to the pumpkin patch together and we both were having a great time he surprised me flowers and coffee and it was such a great day. I was soo happy and waiting on him to ask me to be official because I was ready and I wish I told him this at the time. I assumed he felt it and he would talk to me about it or he could just tell by the way our connection was that if he ever felt uneasy or confused we’d talk and communicate. 

I did ask him that if he ever was starting to talk to another girl he’d tell me and he agreed he would but there will never be another girl he loves me he said. 

But then on october 24th I kept texting him and he was being kinda distant which he has never ever done this the entire time I’ve known him in our 4 years of knowing each other.. it didn’t bother me that much because I know he’s not the guy to do stuff so at 7pm I asked him if he’d like to come over that night since I had a big day tomorrow and wanted to lay with him. he said yes but I made it very clear that I had to be up at 6am for a big work event and he knew this and promised he’d come. 

Then 12:30am comes and I still haven’t heard much from him so I texted him hey are you still coming and he said “I’m so sorry i forgot I was playing video games.” And I was a bit butt hurt that it was a big event for me and he got distracted over games, but I said “oh it’s a little late now just stay home” and he felt bad and said he’d come with Starbucks and food the next morning for me while I’m getting ready for work. 

He did just that and he kissed me and hung with me helped me put my stuff in the car and he said he’d see me at my event later because it was a public work event. I just had to start early before public joins. 

I see him at the event and skip to the events over at 11pm I’m driving home and I ask him again if he could come over and he told me “no I wanna stay home and play video games” that was actually really sad for me because he has never ever ever everrrr say no like that. he’s never wanted to play video games over seeing me so I was really confused. 

Forward to next day I work all day and I barely received a text from him all day again To the point it’s 5pm. So I texted him “hey what’s wrong did I do something can we talk?” And he said something like “I just don’t know how I’m feeling at the moment” and I said “is there another girl or something?” And he said “yes.” And didn’t reply back to my messages after.  

6pm comes and I guess during that time he invited this girl over to his apartment, took the pictures of us in his living room down and hid my anniversary gift that I got him that was on the tv stand, and had sex with her without a condom (we have never tried sex without a condom. I’ve always wanted too but he has never ever tried that with me so I’m hurt even more about that) 

Meanwhile im at home crying what just happened I’m so confused and he’s not answering me back. He finally texts me back at 8pm and face times me saying how much he hates himself and that he feels sick to his stomach and he has to tell me something in person. He wants to still be in my life but doesn’t know how to tell me at the moment. 

I don’t know why I didn’t think it was him doing stuff with a girl I just thought he was ending things with me so I was sad and said just come over here let’s talk now in person why are you avoiding me. and he kept saying he feels sick coming over so he didn’t that night. 

Next morning comes he calls out of work to come over at 6am he sits me down and tells me everything. Shows me proof because I’m a girl who likes to read and know every detail even if it damages me more I just have to know instead of sittin wondering spiralin in my head.. She was one of his new coworkers that he’s been training and he did talk about her once to me about how dumb she was when we were going to the pumpkin patch on October 18th. He was playing video games with her and he was texting her while ignoring me. He said it was just fun at first and he was only worried about playing games with a girl even though that would’ve never bothered me but then it escalated as she asked to do things with him at work and he said no. But then invited her over to his apartment. Hid our pictures of us in his living room and hid my anniversary gift to him that was on his tv stand and had sex with her on his living room floor. 

He said she was initiating all the dirty stuff towards him and it felt good for him at the time but it was lustfully not emotionally. He’s not saying this stuff as an excuse, I asked him to tell me 100% talk to me because I feel I atleast deserve honesty even if it hurts. She also had no clue about me. He called her and told her about me after what they did and broke it off and deleted her on everything and blocked her. He also got a new position in his job so he doesn’t see her anymore. 

He has since apologized and said it was stupidity  and he fell for lust. It was 100% lust and he wishes he could go back in time and never ever do that with her. He said he feels so sick and that he feels he betrayed and cheated on me and he never wanted to be the guy to hurt me. 

I’ve been crying a lot my emotions are going everywhere and I 100% believe if we were together officially he wouldn’t have done this. So I feel it’s partly my fault as I am the one who said no relationship at first. I want him 100% and I can get over the fact he had sex with her. I 100% believe it was just lust. I know him. What I can’t get over is that he did it unprotected and he’s never ever tried that with me. He’s been taking me on dates again but he said he wants to heal us both before we become official and I’m saying I just wanna be official now. He said he doesn’t wanna rush and mess us up and he wants to be the one to ask me officially since that’s all I wanted was him to ask in a fun cute way and he said he wants to give that to me. I have a feeling he’s waiting until November 22nd our original anniversary date to do it but I can’t heal with this uncertainty of does he actually want me? 

Since this situation happened he’s been here for me 24/7. If I say I’m drowning or crying about what he did he will call out of work or whatever he’s doing and comes over to talk to me and hold me. He sometimes cries too but he talks to me about how he loves me and he wants me she was a bad and stupid lusyful choice on his end and he keeps taking accountability about it he hasn’t made any excuses. He’s been planning the dates and he’s been texting me non stop and he says he wants a future with me. He’s been giving me 100% more attention and it does feel genuine and that he is super remorseful. He also said when he was doing it with her all he was thinking about was me. But that kinda made me feel worse him saying that cause like wow you thought of me yet it still wasn’t enough to stop?

But what’s confusing for me is if it were just lust Why couldn’t he have texted me how he was wanting sex? I know our sex life wasn’t that great but why couldn’t he have communicated with me about it and called me over. It just feels like he wanted her. I feel like he didn’t value what we had and what we had even if we weren’t official wasn’t enough for him to just pause and talk to me first. He wanted her and now that it didn’t work the way he intended now he wants to work with me. When I thought we were already building with each other so I’m kinda confuse because I wasn’t sleeping with other people. 

I know men and women see sex differently a bit. I just 100% love him and I want a relationship with him. If anything this situation did is wake me up realizing situationships are stupid and I never wanna do that again. And it also woke me up about how much I want to be boyfriend and girlfriend with him. My heart is too loving and I thought I could handle us building without a label and I was stupid for making myself vulnerable like that. My friends said I should’ve just labeled us in the beginning and that I was stupid for telling him I didn’t want a relationship at first and they swore he’d do stuff with another girl and I defended him soo much to them saying he wants us and our future he won’t do that. Now I feel super embarrassed and I don’t wanna tell anyone because as crazy as this sounds I do want a relationship still I love him so much. I’m so mad at myself for being so immature and I hope my situation helps others never to do this. Doesn’t matter who they are and how much you 100% trust they won’t.. they WILL sleep with another if you’re not labeled even if you communicate no others in the beginning.
