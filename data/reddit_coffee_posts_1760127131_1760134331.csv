1o3emfb,https://i.redd.it/y3dhls8nycuf1.jpeg,Calling all DMV McDonalds Monopoly Moguls!,"I was so excited for McDonald’s Monopoly this year. I even switched to McDonald’s coffee just to get stickers only to realize the food prizes don’t even show up for people in the DMV area??

That’s so unfair. And before anyone judges, there are laid off federal workers, students, parents, all kinds of people here. Plus, we paid for the items that came with those stickers.

Why is McDonald’s running the Monopoly marketing here but not actually honoring the food prizes we win? Someone suggested calling messaging Corporate but that’s not going to do much

So here’s what I’m thinking: let’s make some noise. If this happened to you too, send a quick tip to your local news station. Most of them have a “submit a news tip” section on their website.

I’d love to see McDonald’s confronted about this. It’s ridiculous that we can’t even redeem a free small fries we won.

And to be clear, I will not be buying McDonalds. Everyone should be using the alternative method of entry for free (even if you have a 1 in 60 billion chance to win a prize)

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Doctor Andrew Scheele, Senior Researcher at the UN-VR Cooperative Institute of Integrative Xenobiology***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 31st, 2136*

Bemlin and I walked to work together. We chatted and I was surprised to learn that Bemlin was able to adhere to a pretty strict sleep schedule. I don’t really know what I thought he did, but my own was pretty inconsistent since coming to Venlil Prime.

The Gojid claimed he got ""immutably unproductive” when he didn’t get the exact right amount of sleep. I told him that’s what coffee was for, and he disagreed and said coffee was for a “thrilling sort of wakefulness”. I didn’t understand the difference and Bemlin was adamant, so I chalked it up to a translation oddity.

Tanerik and Acetli arrived shortly after we did. I spotted Celso in the lab, writing something down in his notebook. I decided not to bother him.

I set my coffee down and adjusted my seat. My back wasn’t feeling particularly fussy today, so I opted for a slightly more relaxed posture. I logged in to my computer and noticed I had a missed call.

It was from Su Hui, 59 minutes ago. I also had 93 new emails. That was going to be fun. Before I could begin to prioritize, my screen flashed with an incoming call. I half-grumbled something and closed my office door before answering.

“Scheele,” she greeted. Her tone wasn’t particularly cold, which meant she must’ve been having a good day.

“Su. Good morning.”

“Are you late to work? I called you an hour ago.”

“You called me an hour before I’m expected to be available.”

Her head turned to check something, then sighed. “I see. Forgive me. Are you… in your office? The lighting looks different.”

“Oh, no, Bemlin got me Christmas lights since we last spoke. I don’t know why he did that, but I think they're a nice addition.”

“That’s nice of him. How are things? Has any feedback on your report come through?”

I took a sip of coffee. “Haven’t had much time to look for it. I’m sure there’s some in the last hundred or so emails I’ve gotten.”

Her face scrunched. “I’m sure you can make time. Or simply use an AI assistant to sort through it.”

“I don’t like those things, and I doubt it’d make a difference regardless. People are coming into my office and asking for my hair,” I retorted.

She gave me a disbelieving look. “What about your group?”

“Uh, pretty good, I think.”

“You think?”

“I have no sources of concern,” I clarified. “We all get along with each other. I don’t think Bemlin or Tanerik are ever really on the same wavelength, but not in a bad way? Like constructive interference. Acetli seems content with working independently. Although she stresses herself out, I think.”

“And Celso?” she intoned, clearly having not forgotten our last call.

“I’ve informed myself of… everything. He’s doing great. We had a talk or two and I think we understand each other a lot more than a week ago. And he— Do the Yotul not care about our faces?”

“They were only in the Federation for twenty-two years,” Su answered.

I sighed. “Yeah, I know, and it makes sense.”

“Is there an issue?”

“No. I’m just… debating something in my head.”

She scrutinized me in that way she always did. “Due to the nature of the facility, there’s no strict requirement saying that—”

“I know, I know,” I said, waving a hand. “I mean, I want to, you know, but I’m kind of worried everything will go wrong?”

“…Legally? If they faint and get hurt, they’ll likely be dealing with the UN, not—”

“No, no,” I said, laughing, even if she found no amusement. “I should’ve guessed your mind would’ve immediately gone there. I’m talking about their *comfort*. I’m not going to become the PI whose motto is ‘*my* lab, *my* rules’. I don’t know. I’m probably overthinking it.”

“It’s a strong possibility,” she concluded. “Your inoffensiveness will prevent you from *underthinking* it, certainly.”

“My inoffensiveness?”

“Oh, please. You know exactly what I'm talking about. Now, before we get off topic, I wanted to check in before tomorrow, on the chance you’re taking the holiday.”

I shrugged. “I’m taking most of the day off, only popping by to check on a few things. I wasn’t going to at first, but Bemlin convinced me. He bought some generic New Years stuff; he’s fascinated at the prospect of ‘blowing things up to celebrate planetary movements’. So we’re doing that.”

She cocked an eyebrow. “I see. I also wanted to discuss the welcoming brunch.”

Su and I had previously discussed it; the rather small “event” that was being hosted on the first floor, complete with all the exciting things that came with being a scientist (a bit of food and a digital pamphlet). All the coming humans were supposed to be there, along with any non-humans who were brave enough to get in the same room as us.

I nodded. “I think I found a good place for catering, if you’re open to suggestions. Perzel’s Arrangements.”

She frowned, which meant there was a chance. “What kind of food do they cater?”

“It’s like bagels, but… more. Think freshly baked bread with homemade jam turned up to eleven. It’s great.”

“Hm. I might have my secretary look into it. What I intended to focus on was the opening keynote for the event.”

I could only guess what she needed me for. “Sure. Were you thinking of using some of my figures for your talk? Or did you want me to provide some details about the room we’re going to be in?”

She shook her head. “I believe it would be best if you deliver the keynote, Scheele.”

I opened my mouth, then shut it. “*Me?*”

“Is it really that much of a surprise?”

“Um. Yes? I haven’t even done that much, I don’t even really know what I would talk about. I’ll probably be the least qualified person in that room, to be honest; I’ve taken a peek at the list of people expected here. I mean, you’ve got Alexia Rosalea coming here with half her lab. *Alexia Rosalea*.”

“Scheele,” she flatly said, “*Nǐ zhēnshi gè bèndàn.*”

It took me a moment to discern the tones, given the lack of context. “I’m… thick egg?”

Su rolled her eyes. “You act like it sometimes, even though we both know better. You are more than capable of saying a few words to a few people.”

She was underselling basically everything about that. It was a lot of very important words that would be my *first impression* on a lot of very smart people. I replied, “I’ve only been here for a couple weeks.”

“They have not been there at all. Why don’t you crack a few jokes about the gravity to ease the nerves? Then talk about your exciting research, conclude with some forward-looking remarks, and you will be finished.”

“I have no doubt I can talk for more than an hour, I’m more caught up that *I’m* apparently the best person to talk to a room full of some of the best scientists leading research at the cutting-edge. Why not yourself? Will you not be there?”

“I will be in attendance, and am also disappointed that you apparently do not consider yourself at the ‘cutting-edge’.”

“That’s not—”

“You are in a prime position to lead by example, Scheele. If you consider your position for a moment, I’m sure you will agree with me.”

“Because I just happened to get contacted by you at the perfectly wrong time after the bombing?”

She held her stare.

I sighed. “Sorry, sorry. You know I would’ve taken this role no matter my… abrupt change in living situation. I’m just kind of… It was a lot simpler on Earth, right? I didn’t have to hide my face and deal with blatant racism all the time.”

“Simple problems are hardly ever the ones worth solving. We should all strive to push ourselves to our limits, and you are no exception.”

“…Thanks. I do appreciate that you chose me to do it, I’m still just a little surprised. I’ll make it as good as it can be.”

“Aim for better. But, now that we are in agreement, I can send you this,” she said, and a moment later my computer pinged with a notification. “It has everything I would like you to touch on within the allotted time.”

I skimmed the document. “This is… quite extensive.”

“It will go by quickly once you’re actually speaking. You’ll do great. With that out of the way, are you ready to discuss the UN’s recent mandates?”

“Yeah, yeah. I don’t suppose there’s anything new about those supposed military operations on other planets?”

She tilted her head. “If that were the case, don’t you think I would’ve led with that?”

“Depends on how serious whatever’s happening is. But if *that’s* what you're caught up on, does that mean you’d actually tell me?”

Su gave me that look. “Don’t push your luck.”

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Celso, Home and Sleep-deficient Yotul***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 31st, 2136*

I was not feeling great.

I should’ve felt amazing. I recently slept on cushioned furniture for the first time in months, became friendly with the first Yotul I'd seen on this planet, and gotten plenty of sleep out of it. If that wasn't exciting enough, I learned that my boss respected *me* and not just any work I did.

Unfortunately, those things were easy for an addled mind to spin in a negative light. I'd slept on furniture for the first time in *months*. I embarrassed myself and became indebted to one of the first people that might’ve actually understood me. I'd gotten sleep, which only reminded me of what I was missing out on. I learned that my boss respected me, which meant he was *also* one of the few people that I could not afford to think poorly of me.

All that and my empty stomach. *Especially* my empty stomach. After I left so late yesterday, I didn’t even have time for a short nap, let alone finding a snack before I had to show up for my next shift. On top of that, Andrew had caught me *napping* in the greenhouse. I had no idea if he didn’t realize it or was just too nice to bring it up.

The stress piled up quicker than I could stomp it down. It filled my gut in place of food, sapped my muscles just as my own aching body did, weighed down my shoulders and eyelids more than a lack of sleep ever could.

“How does that sound?” Andrew asked, snapping me out of a bleary daze. He’d been jotting some things down on an erasable marker board in the lab space, developing a plan from my most recent PCR results. His drawings were circular and boxy at the same time, and the lack of translatable words made it hard to focus… or maybe I was just so out of it.

“Sounds great!” I agreed, having only a vague idea of what the human was referring to. “I can probably have a batch of sequencing done by the end of tomorrow.”

“Oh, uh, no need to rush that. Like I said, I’m not expecting much to get done from anyone tomorrow.”

“Tomorrow, right,” I said. I had no idea what was happening tomorrow, only that he wasn’t staying for long so he didn’t expect me to stay long, either. Something about a year, maybe? “I need to stop by to take some plates out of the incubator regardless, but… sequencing can wait.”

“That works. And what about these?” he asked, moving to the other end of the board where I kept a list of things we needed to order. He pulled out his pad to translate the list into his notes. “I *think* these are new.”

“Yeah. The most pressing is probably the dimethyl sulfoxide. The tube we have in the fridge is very low.”

“Noted… We had dimethyl sulfoxide in the fridge?”

“It came with one of the kits.”

“Interesting,” he said, then nodded. “I’ll get these ordered before I leave today… Anything else?”

“I don’t think so. I might head out on time for once, though.”

“Yeah, I’m right there with you. People keep coming into my office asking the most random things. I’d be tempted to set up a FAQ or something, but I honestly can’t predict the absurdity that comes out of their mouths sometimes.” He sighed. “Anyways. Have a good one. See you next paw, or maybe the one after.”

Andrew left. I transformed a few batches of bacteria with different plasmids and plated them. I placed them in the incubator and did calculations on the computer for the rest of the time. I ended up leaving a few minutes early, even.

Distance seemed to stretch throughout my long and perilous journey through the streets of the capital. I didn’t run into any exterminators, so it at least didn’t literally stretch.

I was exhausted when I opened the doors to the library. I was exhausted when I walked up the stairs. I was exhausted when I set my satchel down on a table and sat down.

My head met the desk with a thud. It hurt.

I sighed and tried to think about how great my life was at the moment. *I have a great job, and… and…*

Sometimes letting my mind go blank was better, one of the universe’s few pitying blessings it gave to me. It was a pretty good ability to have and had been useful pretty much every day of my life. Every day since leaving home, at least.

“Celso!” shouted an all-too familiar voice.

I couldn’t even do *nothing* in peace. I groaned, just barely finding the effort to sit up. “Hey, Receor.”

“Are you napping again?” the Farsul scolded. “We don’t have time for that! And— Whoa. Do your eyes usually look like that?”

“Red and puffy?” I guessed. “I think I walked through a bunch of pollen, and my allergies got all crazy. One of those round trees with the long leaves.”

She squinted. “Don’t you mean the long trees with the round leaves?”

I shrugged my ears.

“Hm. Well, regardless of allergies, *you* have some explaining to do.”

I couldn’t muster another witty response. One was already pushing it. “Okay.”

“What do you mean ‘okay’? You scampered off with that other Yotul and you think you can get by with *not* telling me everything right away? You know that was, like, the second Yotul I’ve ever seen! Gah, I wish Pons didn’t ruin my day, we could’ve gotten snacks together! I had *so* much to ask you both!” She excitedly took a place beside me, getting comfortable. “So. Tell me what you two did!”

“I went to his place, drank some juice, and then I went to work. And now I’m here.”

She huffed, clearly disappointed with my lack of detail. “What did you talk about? Did you tell him about your plant stuff, or whatever it is you did for your degree? Or— oh! What about his degree!? I think he mentioned something like that…”

“We talked about all sorts of things,” I said, wishing this conversation would end as quickly as possible. “Degrees and… basically everything else you’d probably expect us to talk about.”

“But you’re both Yotul! There has to be something special that you two did together that I’d love to know about.”

“Why do you… care? There’s more impactful things for someone to obsess over.”

“People are interesting,” she replied. “There’s so much to know about a person, and then make that two people? From a whole other planet, with its own culture and mannerisms and everything else? It’s all so exciting and special!”

“It’s not special,” I flatly answered. I couldn’t keep the annoyance out of my voice. “Two strangers met each other. Would you freak out like this if two Venlil met each other?”

“Well… I mean, it would depend on the specific Venlil,” she said, though lacking some of her previous energy. “Like if two famous vloggers met, *that* would be something. And ‘freak out’ is a strong phrase.”

I sighed. “I… whatever. Can you leave me alone now?”

Her ears sagged. “What’s the matter? I thought you’d be super happy to meet another Yotul! That’s why I was so excited to get you two to meet.”

“I was, I mean, I *am*, but the timing wasn’t exactly the best, and now…” *Now he knows I’m a failure.* “And now I’m really tired and my battery’s more drained than usual.”

“Oh, I'm sorry, I should’ve realized! Do you need a little boost? I'm sure I have some kind of snack or drink in my bag, let me go grab it!”

“No, that’s fine. I'd just like some peace and quiet.”

“Or maybe you can use my pad again?” Receor said, completely ignoring my request. “It's been a while since you called whoever that was. It'd be no problem!”

I hesitated. Yuili and her family were almost certainly worried sick about me, but if I called her and she saw me in this state… She couldn't see me in this state—for both our sakes. “No, thanks,” I said.

“But yours is still broken.”

“Receor, I don't need anything. Seriously. I'm fine.”

My tone must not have convinced her. “Oh, come on. I *hate* assuming things, but I'm pretty sure there's something or a lot of somethings you're not telling me… Are you *sure* you're only coming here because your pad is broken? You said you would only nap here a few times, but it's been—”

“I know, I know. I really do appreciate your help and the offer for more, but everything is good with me, and I'm good with everything.”

The Farsul crossed her arms. “Hmph. Is your new job going fine? You've barely told me anything about it, aside from a vague ‘it's a decent walk that way’. Are you being overworked?” She gasped, eyes going wide at her own assumption. “Oh no! Is that why you're taking so many naps? You told me ages ago that Yotul sleep differently than Farsul, but I never thought about it too much!”

“I’m not being overworked,” I said, then immediately regretted it. I should’ve just gone along with whatever she was thinking, it might’ve made her leave quicker. “I’m just…” I couldn’t find any words.

She leaned on the table, giving me her complete attention. “Celso, what’s going on? I understand that getting fired—entirely unfairly I should add—is about the worst thing that can happen to someone, and everything else you’ve told me surely isn’t helping, but I’ve never seen you like this.”

“My eyes only look like that because—”

“That’s not what I’m talking about.”

Her overly loud and zealous voice was really starting to grate my ears. I sighed. “It might have something to do with the fact that I’ve never had to juggle so many things before. Is that such a huge surprise?”

She huffed. “I can’t help you if I don’t—”

“I *don’t* need help,” I interrupted, louder than I intended. “I can only say it so many times.”

“Do you really mean that? You aren’t just saying things?”

“Why would I lie?”

“I’m not saying that!”

I flicked my ears, annoyed. “Then what *are* you saying?”

“I just…” she stammered. “Everyone needs help sometimes, there’s nothing to be ashamed of!”

“Yeah, there *is* nothing to be ashamed of. Do you need to hear it again?”

“I know what you said! I’m just trying to be a shoulder you can lean on!”

“I don’t *need* a shoulder!” I snapped, anger leaking into my voice, likely for the first time in years. “Not yours, not *anyone else’s*.”

She took a step back, eyes filled with worry. “C-Celso, I w-wasn’t— If it were me, I would want—”

“If it were *you?* Of course, the only time you want to talk is when it’s about you. Anything that isn’t about the latest gossip just goes out the other ear. I tell you about my degree, and all you care to remember is ‘his plant stuff’?” I scoffed. “I might as well try and show you a drawing in the dirt I made with a stick, right? You don’t care. *Nobody* cares about the *stupid Yotul* who clearly doesn’t belong in this *advanced society*. So forgive me for refusing your ever-benevolent shoulder.”

“I— I didn’t—”

I grabbed my satchel and stood. “I’ve been screwed over more times than I can count, and that’s only considering everything that happened *after* I moved to this damn planet. You don’t see me making it anyone else’s issue. Take a hint, for once in your life.”

I walked away.

As satisfying as it was to let so much emotion out, I hated the feeling a million times more. I knew very well what happened to those who expressed themselves.

I hated it. All of it. I hated that I wanted to be angry, furious, and I hated that I couldn’t. I hated myself for allowing so many things to happen that I even got to this point in the first place. I hated how I smothered my own thoughts.

I didn’t even make it ten steps before the glowing coals were suffocated with spent ash. As quickly as flames erupted, they were doused in sadness.

Terrible, terrible feelings simmered in my chest as I rushed down the stairs and out of the library. I should’ve taken her help. I should’ve turned around and apologized, but I was too ashamed and too prideful. I was too tired and hungry. My eyes were too red and puffy, but no longer from tiredness or made-up allergies.

I *should’ve* never come to this planet.

The sun hit my fur, library doors slamming shut behind me. I didn’t care where my legs took me, so long as my thoughts were pulled elsewhere.

Neon lights strobed across the dance floor, illuminating flashes of sweat-sheened skin and ecstatic faces. I was three drinks past sensible, the world a pleasant, buzzing blur, when she walked through the crowd. The sea of people seemed to part for her, not out of politeness, but necessity. She was a force of nature.

Her eyes, a sharp, piercing blue even in the dim light, locked onto mine from across the bar. She didn’t smile. She appraised. A slow, deliberate sip from her glass, her gaze never wavering, a challenge and an invitation all in one. My mouth went dry. I was drunk, but I was sober enough to feel the jolt of that connection, a live wire snapping between us.

She was beside me before I could formulate a thought, her scent cutting through the stale beer and cheap perfume—rain-soaked violets and something darker, muskier. “You look lost,” she said, her voice a low alto that vibrated right through me.

“Just… looking for the right map,” I managed to slur, the words feeling thick and clumsy on my tongue.

A ghost of a smile touched her lips. “Maybe you need a new compass.” Her hand, cool and sure, brushed against my arm, and a shiver, a real, honest-to-god shiver, raced down my spine. The flirty banter was a blur of innuendo and sharp wit, a game I was desperately trying to keep up with despite the tequila fogging my brain. Her intelligence was as potent as her presence, and the combination was utterly intoxicating. The decision was never really mine. When she leaned in, her lips grazing my ear as the music swelled, it wasn’t a question.

“My apartment is five minutes away. Let’s go.”

Yes.

The cab ride was a haze of tangled limbs and hungry, open-mouthed kisses. Her taste was intoxicating. Her hands were everywhere, claiming, possessive, and I was more than happy to be claimed. We stumbled through her door, a sleek, modern space of cool grays and dark wood, and she pushed me back against it the second it closed. The lock clicked with a sound of finality.

Her dominance wasn’t a suggestion. It was a fact. She stripped my jacket off, then my shirt, her nails scraping lightly down my chest, making me gasp. I tried to turn the tables, to kiss her with the aggression I usually wielded, but she caught my wrists in one strong hand and pinned them above my head against the door.

“Uh-uh,” she murmured, her breath hot against my neck. “I don’t think so.” She held me there effortlessly. How was she so strong? The thought was fleeting, drowned out by a surge of pure, unadulterated lust. My struggle was half-hearted, a token resistance fueled more by ingrained habit than any real desire to stop her. I was too drunk, too turned on, too completely under her spell to fight it.

She led me to the bedroom, a minimalist sanctuary dominated by a large, low platform bed. She pushed me down onto my back and stood over me, a wicked smile playing on her lips as she undressed. Her body was a masterpiece of lean muscle and soft curves. My eyes drank her in, my cock straining painfully against my jeans.

But then she did something I didn’t expect. Instead of joining me, she opened a drawer, the sound echoing in the silent room. She turned back, and in her hands was a harness, black leather, and a sleek, substantial silicone strap-on. My brain, muddled as it was, screeched to a halt. What?

“Have you ever?” she asked, her voice dropping to a husky whisper as she stepped into the harness, tightening the straps with a practiced efficiency that sent another dizzying thrill through me.

“N-no,” I stammered, my heart hammering against my ribs. A flicker of panic, of masculine pride, rose up. This wasn’t… this isn’t what usually happens.

She saw the conflict on my face and crawled onto the bed, straddling my hips. She leaned down, her breasts brushing my chest, and kissed me, deep and slow and devastating. “Trust me,” she breathed into my mouth. “You’ll enjoy it. I’ll make you feel things you’ve never even imagined. Let me take care of you.”

That did it. Something in me broke, or perhaps unlocked. The last of my resistance melted away under the heat of her gaze and the promise in her voice. I nodded, a shaky, surrendered movement. “Okay.”

She prepared me with a cool, slick gel, her fingers expert and gentle, stretching me, coaxing my body to accept her. The sensation was strange, foreign, a dull pressure that quickly bloomed into a sharp, breathtaking fullness as she pressed the tip against me. I tensed, a gasp catching in my throat.

“Shhh,” she soothed, her free hand stroking my thigh. “Relax. Just let go.”

And then she pushed.

The world dissolved into pure, shocking sensation. A sharp, burning stretch that immediately gave way to a deep, throbbing pleasure so intense it stole the air from my lungs. Oh god. She began to move, a slow, rolling rhythm that hit a spot inside me I never knew existed. Every nerve ending was on fire. My own cock, neglected and leaking, twitched against my stomach with every one of her thrusts.

She set a punishing, perfect pace, her hips pistoning against me, her eyes watching my every reaction. I was completely at her mercy, and it was the most electrifying, liberating feeling of my life. I wasn't in control. I didn't have to perform. I just had to feel. My sounds were shameless, raw moans and breathless pleas for more, harder, please. She smiled, a feral, beautiful thing, and gave me exactly what I begged for.

The orgasm that ripped through me was seismic, a convulsive, whole-body event that seemed to originate from where our bodies were joined. I cried out, my vision whiting out as I came untouched, stripes of release painting my stomach. She didn’t stop, fucking me through the overwhelming waves of pleasure until they tipped over into a sweet, sensitive agony. Only then did she slow, her own breath coming in ragged gasps as she collapsed beside me.

I floated in a hazy, blissed-out void, my body thrumming with the aftershocks. She curled against my side, her head on my chest, and we fell asleep like that, tangled together in the aftermath.

 *

Sunlight, sharp and unforgiving, stabbed at my eyelids. My head pounded a brutal rhythm in time with my heartbeat. I was alone. The other side of the bed was cool, untouched. I sat up, wincing, the memories of the night before crashing over me in a disorienting wave of vivid, erotic snapshots. The club. The woman. The strap-on. The… everything.

I found her in the kitchen, pouring coffee into a single mug. She was dressed in a sharp, professional blouse and trousers, her hair perfectly styled. She looked like she’d been up for hours.

“Morning,” I croaked, my voice rough.

She turned, and her expression was polite, distant. A slight, confused frown touched her brow. “Oh. Hello. You’re… still here.”

The words were like a bucket of ice water. You’re still here. Not ‘good morning.’ Not ‘how did you sleep.’ She looked at me like I was a piece of furniture she’d forgotten to have moved.

“I… yeah,” I said, my mind reeling. “Last night… it was…” I fumbled for the words, desperate for her to acknowledge the seismic shift that had occurred in this very apartment. In me.

She took a sip of her coffee, her blue eyes utterly devoid of the fiery possession I’d drowned in just hours before. They were cool, professional. Impatient.

“Last night was a lot of fun,” she said, her tone flat, terminally casual. She glanced at her watch. “I’ve got a shareholder meeting in twenty. You should probably call a cab.” She picked up her briefcase. It was a dismissal. A final one.

She was at the door when she paused and looked back. For a second, I thought I saw a flicker of something—recognition, maybe? But it was gone before I could be sure.",1,1760133629.0,u_kay_luck28,0,1.0,True

There’s a guy [64M]  I [36m] like and we rarely see each other as we live a 100 miles apart. We’ve never had sex or anything- apart from oral but when we do hang out it’s always a short coffee or a bite to eat. 

A few months ago I was free and he suggested I visited his city so we could hang out and he invited me to this event and I said it looked great and I was excited. He then proceeded to send me the link to buy a ticket. The ticket was literally £10. That really turned me off as firstly he invited me to this event he was already 
attending and secondly I’m traveling 100 miles. 

 I just thought that gesture was such a turn off. I’m not after him for his money, I have my own and I own my own home so I’m 100% not a freeloader and never have been, it’s just the principle of it

1o3e6eq,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1o3e6eq/how_do_you_manage_friendships_during_major/,How do you manage friendships during major depression? I am in crysis,"Three weeks ago I was in an euthymic phase, though leaning low, after a 10-day hypomanic episode in September. I was active again, taking public transport, even enrolled in a photography course. I was the one who suggested to a friend that we meet up, but for one reason or another, we never did. Then, three weeks ago, I started slipping downward. I skipped class, curled up in bed, stopped taking public transport, and eventually fell into a full major depressive episode. Hypersomnia — 11 hours at night plus another hour during the day. I don’t need to tell you about the negative thoughts of guilt and worthlessness and death. I’m slowed down, and my face looks like I’ve aged ten years in twenty days. I’m also suddenly losing all my hair. 

In the past, when I fell into depression, I would always say it out loud — that I was depressed and couldn’t go out. But this time I didn’t have the courage, because, as you know, for those who don’t understand bipolar disorder, it seems absurd that someone can be active, eager to go out, doing things — and then just weeks later become a living corpse. Today she asked if I wanted to go for a walk in the park tomorrow, then drinks and aperitivo until evening. I said yes, because I was ashamed to say how I really feel — afraid of seeming whiny, and of losing her too.

And now I’m here, lying in bed like a dead person, with a face I don’t recognize. Even though it’s evening (I’m not on US time), and I usually have a bit more energy at night — in the morning I struggle even to get up for the coffee my partner makes, only to go back to bed without even washing - my energy level is like someone who’s been run over by a truck. I don’t know what to do. My partner says that if I cancel tomorrow, she’ll probably stop asking me to go out, like everyone else has slowly done. I have bipolar II, but I’m almost always depressed despite the meds. I know I should push myself to go out, to avoid losing yet another person who distances themselves because I’m depressed. But at the same time, I know I’ll be boring, have nothing to say, and the idea of staying out until evening for drinks feels impossible.

She’s picking me up by car — I don’t drive. What would you do if you were me? Would you say it right at the first “Hi, how are you?” Or pretend? Or what? I’m so ashamed of my face and how I’ve deteriorated. It’s a deadlock. Telling people “Sorry, I’m depressed” — it’s one thing to say it once, another to say it eight months a year. And then they leave you behind. But if I don’t say it, I’ll just seem boring, whiny, or stupid. I messed up. I should’ve made up an excuse, another commitment. I don’t know. Right now I just want to disappear. Regardless. How do you manage your relationships during depressive phases?",1,1760133092.0,bipolar,1,1.0,False

He cheated on me, manipulated me to the point where I was asking for forgiveness just to ask the truth, cheated on me, while he was with me for about 8 months, made a post asking ""where to take her for a 2 year anniversary"" I knew about that girl and ig she also knew about me and she's gonna get married to someone else, they both were doing this while being aware of what they are doing either FWB, i contacted that girl with shaky hands to let her know but she told me we are just friends and please don't contact me after this. 

When i confronted him he didn't said anything, didn't responded, didn't explained himself, that showed how much off a scumbag he is. 

Before all this there were clear signs, he lied to me since the beginning - we started talking online, after talking for a month he asked me to go on a date with him, soon he told me he likes me and sees a potential in this relationship, I too liked him and we started dating but as time passes and I got more curious, the suspicious begans once I asked him to show me around his work place ( told me he's a doc, but he sent me pictures that was downloaded from google and explained what was happening in those pictures as it was clicked during the present time, days later my gut told me to go and search that hospital online I did and the exact same photos were there uploaded 2 or 3 years ago ).

Confronted upon he told me he did it because I was constantly asking and he was busy with the workload, lane excuse so I told him I need time to rethink about this, he said he can show his id proof - showed me one card which didn't indicate that he works where he says he does, later he photoshopped his picture to make it look like he was at hospital, i caught that too. 

He said he's shy and can't ask anyone to click his picture and he wanted one out of his department, i sympathized and decided to give him time to be upon up to me about his work. 

Later i found he's been hiding his instagram stories from me, ik the trust gets shattered from here still my dumb ass decided to go on just because of ""love"". 

When i confronted about that he says maybe a glitch but it wasn't it had already happened quite a few times, he never made me meet his friends, but told me his mum and brother knows about me as he uploaded a photo of us holding hands and within those hours his friends didn't saw it but his family did and he got into trouble so he decided to delete that. 

I was getting very mixed feelings about him and they way he does this things so i texted his brother as he himself said he knows, but he got furious accused me that i ruined the relationship between him and his brother and his brother warmed him to stay out of this ( the conversation I had with him was barely nothing just simply knowing eachother and how we met, he was way too cool about it ) he told me about the relationship getting tarnished bw him and his brother when i stared confronting him about that girl, to make me feel guilty. 

Now the table turned and I was the one who apologised constantly for texting his brother and he was doing his best to make me feel guilty for contacting his brother, he liked seeing me apologizing continuously. 

Now after this he said he is ready to move forward and let this all leave behind, I too was tired and said yeah maybe we can start afresh and told him well what bothers me, he said he will acknowledge, the mistake I made here was that I went to his place after I had texted his brother and he was furious and very angry and i showed up unannounced, he told me to go away while closing the main door of his room for 5 mins and I was still there standing for him to come back so I can apologise, he came back, saw how it's scaring me, i told me him to let me sit and give me water i can't see your anger more than this it's making me scared and it has opened some traumatic events that had happened in my childhood and it was triggering alot, he understood and let me sit at his bed, i asked please hug me i need that rn, my heart is beating loud he did that, and while he was hugging me at the corner of his bed i saw belongings of other women and he told me come I'll drop you home and when I stood up I look at the end of his bed there were 2 full bags of women clothes and on top of that there was a sanitary pad, my heart skipped a bit but I couldn't confront him back then, i couldn't handle another fight  ( i should've leave him after that )

I was still talking to him on text we only met once before this another incident took place, I saw him with another girl at coffee shop when at that day he told me he's out of town, and at the very same day he told me we can start afresh when I come back. 

I asked him what was that? He told me he came back to town with his father and found that girl in the parking so she was just tagging along with him and his father was waiting for him at the next shop so he couldn't came up and say hi. 

Then I was emotionally lost instead of thinking rationally i was easily getting manipulated by him, found alot of things about that girl that she's into ONS, she actually may have live with him ( I feel disgusted with the thought that maybe whenever he comes to pick me up he first might have made sure she wasn't around and hid her stuff ) and to be still with me, he showed me a video claiming that girl has a boyfriend and that video contained that her bf is teaching her how two drive a car and later kissed her on the cheeks, he told me they have been together for years and about to get married so there is nothing to worry about. 

My emotional dependency and attachment towards him grew at a certain level and still decided to be with him, the same he showed me that video he went out with that girl the very same night as she bought a new car, the same very I told him to spend some time with me as I missed him alot and needed some love but he said he has to go to his hometown, again he went out with her and uploaded the pictures she might have clicked off him, when i asked lied to me and said he went out with one of his colleague, later i found the colleague he claims to be with wasn't even his colleague in a first place. 

After this all happened i wasn't thinking straight and kept asking him to tell me truth, he was emotionally abusing me to the point where he put a blame on me that i harrassed him when I told him to kiss me like he used too and put the blame on me for ruining his mental health and his therapist had to increase his medications, this all deeply affected me. 

I was again being sorry for what I hadn't put him through and it was a made up story that he made to look him innocent so I don't bring up that girl ever again, he made me feel guilty, said mean things too me, blamed me for ruining his relationship with his friends and family, the relationship i ruined with his friends was that i told him about that girls ONS and he acted blindsided and doesn't ever support any of this, he told me i barely meet them and now I can't even because of you and i ruined his relationship with his brother because i talked to him. 

Now being with that all he was still gaslighting me and trying to make out his way, i confronted him about everything again he lost his temper at the very same day i found his reddit account where he made a post in the city sub to ask where to bring her to celebrate their 2 year anniversary and called her car as his and there were pretty absurd comments in his previous reddit account before meeting me he had made comments about having sex, having FWB and being cheated on his previous relationship. 

When i asked him about his sexual history he told me he's still a virgin and that FWB comment he made so that it would make him look cool. 

Now on this reddit account he again said the very same thing and admitted having sex at 28 and is active at dating apps. 

I confronted him about this all via text as he said he will be not in the city till dec and might come to meet me in bw, but when I told him ik it all he choose not to respond, not to clarify, didn't even explained himself. 

At last I got my eyes opened up with the way he treated me and told him I'll go to your place and ask your landlord for the cctv footage which might have recorded her entering and going out and that should be enough to prove for all the lies, and cheating you did and cut him out complete. 

I'm shattered, I feel so disgusted that I loved that kind of a person who was promising me a future, he knew I had a hard childhood where I was SAd by my own father and he choose to put that blame on me, he knew i get triggered when someone shouts at front of me and I go numb, I can't tolerate a lie being told to me cause that made me question my own worth, I feel like i don't deserve love and i never will and no one will love me. 

He put me there back in which took me years to come out off, within just months, my gut never agreed to sleep with him, i always told him I'm not ready to have sex, even though if I was my expression turned him off and he said you aren't. 

Should I let his brother know, ik he might be happy and living his life with that girl, but what did I do deserve this? I was loving him, i never cheated, never lied, was always true to him, was always there for him. 

And his brother is getting married to a girl he's been with 5 years that's what love is, he compared their relationship infront of me and told me you can't maintain a long term relationship only because I have the ability to raise questions and confront him all the damn time because of his own actions. 

Would i ruin his marriage if I let him know? Would that deeply affecte their relationship this time for sure? I want him to suffer the way he made me suffer. ",2,1760133003.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

His hoodie, admittedly, was nearly identical in color to the store's employee uniforms. But his had a faded college logo and a coffee stain on the sleeve, not exactly official attire.

He was checking the tread on a pair of trail runners when a voice behind him said,
“Excuse me, do you know where the resistance bands are?”

Jake turned, half-laughing. “Oh—I don’t work here.”

The woman looked startled. “Oh! Sorry, you just look like you do.”

“No worries,” Jake said, smiling, and went back to the shoes.

Five minutes later, a teenage guy waved him down near the weights.
“Hey, boss, can you help me get one of these dumbbells down? It’s kinda stuck.”

Jake sighed. “Still not an employee, man.”

The teen squinted. “You sure? You’ve got that ‘manager vibe.’”

Whatever *that* meant.

The tipping point came ten minutes later, when an actual employee—maybe seventeen, hair in a messy bun, name tag that said *TINA*—walked up holding a walkie-talkie.
“You been helping people?” she asked.

Jake blinked. “I—no? I mean, kind of. Accidentally.”

Tina gave him a look that was half exasperation, half amusement.
“Corporate’s doing a secret shopper thing this week. I thought you were one of them pretending not to be staff. I was about to ask if you’d clocked in.”

Jake laughed. “I swear I’m just trying to buy shoes.”

Tina nodded. “Alright, well—if you *do* want a job, we’re hiring. You already passed phase one.”

He didn’t take the job. But he did leave with a 10% discount—“for the confusion,” Tina said.

And a pretty solid story.

1o3e4a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/sweatystartup/comments/1o3e4a8/if_you_own_a_brickandmortar_and_arent_rewarding/,"If you own a brick-and-mortar and aren’t rewarding UGC, you’re burning money","Most local businesses ignore the creators in their own neighborhood. Coffee shops, gyms, salons, restaurants. They focus on paid ads or hope for organic word of mouth. Meanwhile, there are tons of creators with 2k-10k local followers who would gladly post about them for simple rewards.

# Why hyperlocal works:

A creator with 3k followers in your city is more valuable than an influencer with 50k spread across the country. Their audience actually lives near you. They can drive foot traffic, not just online engagement.

Local followers convert better because they can physically visit your business. A post from a neighborhood creator feels like a recommendation from a friend, not an ad.

# The framework:

**Step 1: Identify local creators**

Search location tags on Instagram and TikTok for your city or neighborhood. Look for accounts with 1k-10k followers posting regularly about local spots. Check who's tagging other businesses similar to yours.

Make a list of 20-30 creators who fit your vibe and have engaged local audiences.

**Step 2: Create location-specific tasks**

Don't just ask for generic posts. Make tasks that highlight what makes your business special.

**Some examples:**

\- Post a story showing your favorite item on our menu with the city hashtag

\- Create a Reel featuring our space with a local landmark in the background

\- Share a before and after if you're a salon or gym

\- Post a photo of you at our location and tag three local friends

**Step 3: Offer rewards that matter locally**

Free products, service credits, VIP access to events, discounts they can share with their local followers. The reward should feel valuable without killing your margins.

**Some reward examples:**

\- Coffee shop: 500 points = Free drink every visit for a month

\- Gym: 1000 points = Free month of classes

\- Salon: 750 points = Complimentary service

**Step 4: Build a neighborhood ambassador list**

Once you find 5-10 creators who consistently post, treat them like VIPs. Give them early access to new products, invite them to soft openings, feature their content on your channels.

They become your hyperlocal marketing team without the overhead of traditional influencer contracts.

# Why this is untapped:

Most local businesses don't think about creators as a channel. They see creators as something big brands do. But neighborhood creators are accessible, affordable, and often excited to work with local spots they already visit!

The economics make sense too. A few hundred dollars in product or store credit spread across multiple creators generates more content and reach than the same spend on local ads.

I built Social Strudel partially for this use case. Local businesses can set up task-based programs where neighborhood creators earn points and redeem them for products and perks. It makes it easy to coordinate multiple creators without managing individual contracts.

Homes have character. They’re creative, relaxed, and naturally social. You feel more human there than in a rented office booth.

Imagine opening your living room or kitchen table to a few remote workers for the day. They bring their laptops, share space, maybe have lunch together, and end up talking about work, life, or ideas.

Hosts are verified (IDs, passports, insurance) and provide essentials like fast Wi-Fi and a comfortable workspace. Some might even have multiple spots available.

***HAHAHAAAHHAHHAHAHAAAHHAAAAAHAAAAHAAAAHAHHAHAHAHA***

The fucking IDEA that this gormless mouth-breathing homunculus maintains ANY let alone SEVERAL FILTERS on his speech and thoughts is the funniest goddamn thing he could have possibly said after my time in the Shmanners Shmines watching him stuff his feet into his mouth with more dedication and persistence than a top-paid foot fetish model, after hearing him go on and on about “Was Jane Austen ACTUALLY funny,” about “Here’s why Albert D.J. Cashier’s life was an affirming story of perseverance,’ about “Ewww, fermented fish in seal guts gross icky bad foreign food me no yummy :(,” about “here’s why nobody knows where the word ‘tuxedo’ came from, oooooh, spooky history mystery!” Like. Like just on an incredibly basic level, this man does not filter out ANYTHING anymore. Mr. “Mens Rights! Actually, wait, that was a joke, it’s important the audience know I made a joke and don’t think that” McElroy. This whole episode so far is him patting himself on the back over and over again for being such an attentive, listening creator who takes his audience’s concerns seriously and interrogates himself when he messes up, which could not be any further from the truth as we’ve observed it across these collective recaps than if Travis shot ‘truth’ into a 1970s Soviet space probe and slingshot it halfway out to Neptune. All while showing how, in actuality, once his audience starts asking for greater accountability and the praise dries up, he’d soon turn away from having his ‘fans’ provide any sort of feedback in favor of plugging his ears and shutting his eyes and screaming ‘WE’RE ALL CHILL PICKLES HERE, CENTAURS ARE NATURALLY LESS DESERVING OF LAND AND CULTURE DUE TO THEIR INFERIOR BREEDING AND CONTAMINATED BLOOD, LALALALALALA ARGO OPENS UP A CASINO RIVERBOAT WITH FIRBOLG TRAPPINGS LALALALALA”

Where the fuck was I

HOW ARE THERE S T I L L more than eighteen minutes left?!?!?!

>Travis: If it continues to bother you, you are allowed to stop listening.

>Tybee: Yes.

>Travis: That’s the exchange, that- that’s the deal that we have here. And-and-and- and that’s why- that’s why I would tell someone to calm down in that scenario, they have all the power, because they can just stop consuming it.”

Thanks for your permission to go, Travis, but I sold my fuckin’ soul to a dwindling shitpost reddit in exchange for the most minor of Internet forum fame, so I’m once more cursed to trawl through your detritus and debris in search of meaning and jerkable content for the algorithm until I finally can bear no more and my blackened lungs squeeze and constrict like balloons under pressure and at last rupture in a burst of viscera and shmoal dust. How we all doin’ out there in radioland? Terrified of the specter of imminent death, destruction and disease as we slide further into fascism and the government’s most essential services get wiped out en masse? Cool! Who wants to get back to this blowhard bloviating about his woke credentials to escape with me? No one? Haha, nice try, but you’re COMING DOWN THE SHAFT WITH ME-

Tybee suddenly swerves back into the discussion with an all-timer for subject changes.

>Tybee: So many friends of mine listen to Joe Rogan’s podcast. I don’t like Joe Rogan. I never have. Do I think that Joe Rogan has some great points and some of his discussions are worth listening to? Totally. But, like, as a comedian? And as a dude? I’m just, like, super not really that in to Joe Rogan. I think he’s kinda sexist and his jokes are dated. I saw him live on stage recently and I was unimpressed. But I don’t feel the need to go to Joe Rogan and be like ‘You’re a smart guy, why are you saying those sexist things?!’ I don’t- I don’t need that, I don’t want that, I don’t wanna talk to Joe Rogan about it, that’s how he feels about stuff, all that needs to happen, for me, is to just not listen.

>Travis: Yeah.

>Tybee: Not that we want you to stop listening to the show, and it’s one thing to be, like, ‘hey, this thing sorta, like, stuck out to me,’ but, like, if we don’t change it, y- I mean- like I said, I take responsibility for lacking compassion for that one person, and if that person stopped listening to the show, I’m sorry.

Incredible that the example Tybee uses of ‘don’t critique, just stop listening’ is Joseph Rogannette Biden, the man who can be credited with helping to prime thousands if not millions of young white men for recruitment into fascism and facilitated their fall down the hypermasculiue pipeline towards the ultimate toxic masculinity, a man who can credibly be blamed for helping to sow even further distrust in established media and bringing more people into the fringes where they could expand beyond him to Alex Jones and other flavors of ideologue. Also, lmao that Tybee says he’s a ‘smart guy’ without any pushback, lol. This really IS the most 2017 episode I coulda picked, huh? I’m half-expecting someone to make a Kong: Skull Island or Wonder Woman reference to complete it.

>Travis: Listen, if you’re listening to this, if you listen to any of my shows, I am so inexpressibly grateful for you, because, literally, without you I wouldn’t be able to fed my family, or put a roof over our heads, or anything. M- Podcasting is my career, my audience is- are my patrons, umm… sometimes literally, and without you, I w- I wouldn’t be able to exist, survive.

Travis McElroy admitting he has no hirable skills in any industry outside of podcast, or Travis McElroy admitting he’s a tulpa thought-form who requires an audience in order to exist and manifest in this realm?

>Travis: And so what-what is important to you, what bothers you, DOES matter to me, this is me saying, like, ‘Keep it to yourself, I don’t fucking care,’ I DO care! It’s just that I-I can only- I only have so much RAM to be able to keep concerns in my head before I becom- become unable- think of it like red tape, right?

WEEWOO WEEWOO TRAVIS LIBERTARIAN ALERT WEEWOO WEEWOO BIG DOG’S ABOUT TO GO OFF ON RED TAPE AND BUREAUCRACY LET’S FUCKING GOOOOOOOO

>Travis:  If I allow too much red tape, suddenly I will be unable to get anything done, because I will be trying to accommodate all the different rules and regulations and restrictions.

>Tybee: Right.

>Travis: And I-I just can’t do that, I can’t- I can’t. And most people can’t. And people that try to- and try to knock all the corners off of a stone usually end up with, like, the smallest fucking stone. Um, and so there’s gotta be some balance between being able to ask for what you want, but being okay- I’ve talked about it on the show, I’m a big fan of Phillip DeFranco, I don’t like EVERYTHING he says, but that’s okay! That I don’t like everything he says, I enjoy his product overall, I am able to continue consuming it.

>Tybee: Right.

>Travis: If it reaches a point where I no longer enjoy that, cool! But for me it’s not a switch, it’s not either someone’s good or they’re bad, y’know? I-It’s context- god, I HATE that we have to keep talking about context because- hmm… There are so many people who take a really hard line, they’re not willing to give context to discussions of context, um… but… it’s important. Because, I’m not t-

Oh, this is just DELICIOUS. Travis, in his attempts to say he isn’t like this, ends up describing the EXACT THING that has happened to modern MBMBAM and TAZ as a result of them ceding ground to the most parasocial among their audience. Because of how ‘no bummers’ has taken root in the collective fandom consciousness, the brothers have had to pivot away from even some of the most basic ‘edgy’ or ‘taboo’ subject matter in a way that’s mutually infantilized both them and their audience in a fascinating and disturbing echo chamber. Justin wants to try and explore aspects of the opioid crisis through Amber’s backstory and character interactions? Nuh-uh, that’s too heavy and we don’t wanna get into that, her friend was just possessed and actually the fantasy drugs are like weed and shit, it’s fine. All of this leading, of course, to the most sanded-down and shapeless McElproduct, Travis’ magnum opus of Abnimals where they weren’t even letting themselves swear and curse, one of the few bits of ‘edgy’ behavior they allow themselves anymore. Now, of course, when I say ‘edgy’ here I don’t mean genuinely off-putting or outright offensive things to the same degree as, say, a mid-2005 Newgrounds Flash animation might showcase, but that this push for a ‘purer’ and ‘purer’ style, away from even the hint of controversy or taboo, has inevitably eroded any real sense of stakes, drama or interest in their work. Better to just let Travis toss out his Sad Libs and eat up some time with a few Munch Squads to let Justin air out his ‘special interest’ about fast food press releases, instead of getting into any too deep on anything potentially bummer-adjacent. And, of course, this all ends up at TAZ: Royale, where they have a death game with no death, a battle Royale with barely any battling, and a GM so averse to having any kind of actual intrigue that he’s stepped in to save the PCs on multiple occasions rather than let the ‘dice tell a story.’

Twilight years? Fuck that, there’s still a bit of light to die in the twilight. They’ve entered the vast expanse of night, and the stars grow ever colder, their light shining less and less brightly upon the faces of the McElroys as the gnawing emptiness of entropy and death calls to us all inexorably.

>Tybee: Can I talk about-

>Travis: Yes.

>Tybee: Go ahead.

>Travis: Please, anything. No, whatever you were going to say. Yes, please.

>Tybee: Anything but this! Um… I just wanna tell one quick story, and- and I have a philosophical question to ask. Yesterday, I was in my coffee shop, my office, and there was a-

>Travis: Coffice? Coffice shop? There’s something there, I’ll find it.

>Tybee: We’l- we’ll find it. Um… now I’m, um, in it, I gotta think about it, gotta figure it out, umm… nope, can’t think of it, okay!

Truly a devastating example of Travis having just nothing to offer when someone else is speaking. I keep thinking I’m maybe being uncharitable to him sometimes, when the fumes blind my eyes enough that I start to doubt my perceptions of this mediocre man, and then the next time I hit play on any of his media, there he is, indulging in all his worst and most annoying habits and traits without any self-awareness or desire to change. Like, I know we make fun of ‘word sound like other word’ as his main comedy, but it truly deflates me every time he interjects with a literal sub-preschool bit of humor that he seems to think is just devastatingly funny. It’s even worse here because he totally derails Tybee right as she was starting her story, and he doesn’t even HAVE an actual pun in place, he’s workshopping the bit in real-time before her and dragging Tybee along into the space before she can actually get more than a full sentence of her story spat out.

I take back what I said in my Runcap; while Tybee and Travis have better chemistry than Travis and Teresa as co-hosts, Travis still cannot resist talking over the nearest adjacent woman to him in any podcast with any co-host. Man’s a fucking overachiever in mansplaining shit he doesn’t even understand enough to regular-splain.

Anyway, on with Tybee’s story after that momentously thrilling and vital interruption from the Big Dog, woof woof.

Tybee talks about a time she went into her local coffee shop/office space and observed a woman who “looked to be… homeless” and for some reason she says ‘homeless’ in a weirdly… sensual whisper? I don’t know what tone she’s going for, but it makes the word sound like the name of an old lover brought back to her lips for a moment, and I realize I’m truly stuck in this hell because there’s somehow another fourteen minutes left and I’m wasting this many words on the way she says one word because I’ve lost control of this Interrocap and it’s taken me like five goddamn days to make it through this one episode because of how dense and yet empty it is with talking that both tells me so much about Travis but also slides in and out of my ears like greased syrup.

>Tybee: She looked like she had not had access to a shower in a while and she was rearranging the stuff on the counter, like the protein bars and stuff. And I was like ‘Huh… okay’

SHE SAID THE LINE, BART, SHE SAID TODAY’S SECRET WORD, AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH EVEN WHEN THE BIG DOG HIMSELF DOESN’T SAY IT WE’RE NEVER FREE

Tybee ordered her drink, gave the woman space, and then heard her start talking to no one, conversing with the air, leading to a developing situation with the other baristas as they start to try and quiet her down after ordering drinks. Guy behind the counter offers to get her the drinks, then insists she leave, woman asks why and the barista says he’s not required to tell her, leading to a further back and forth that escalates it to the point the other girl behind the counter starts dialing for the cops.

>Tybee: Because what was doing- while she wasn’t necessarily directly bothering anyone, it was strange, it was unsettling, it wa- it was a strange thing. Um… So… and we’re- I live in sort of a… kind of a WASPy area. So, it’s probably more disrupting to the patrons at this particular coffee shop to have her there that it might be at a different coffee shop, I don’t know?

You don’t fucking say, Tybee. You don’t fucking say.

She goes on to say that, while the barista wasn’t wrong to ask her to leave without specifying as they have the right to refuse service, she thought he could have at least just given a quick ‘you’re disturbing the other patrons’ as the reason to prevent further escalation, as she then goes on to recount the woman becoming increasingly angry and actively pissed after this, let’s slip this is happening in Burbank. Multiple baristas try to calm her down, the main guy forces her out after giving free drinks.

Tybee reveals that, uh…

>Tybee: During this, I set my phone up just in case anything went down. I don’t- I didn’t know if she was going to be yelling more, or it was going to become destructive, or if the police were going to be unkind to her, I didn’t know what was going to happen. So I just set my phone up to start recording a video and just left it, like I wasn’t even watching, I just was, like, head down, recording. And it’s worth noting that the woman was also white. She was probably in her, like, sixties. I don’t know… is there - and maybe some of our listeners know this - is there a better way to handle someone like that in your place of business? Because I don’t wanna diagnose her, based on her speaking to herself I would imagine there is some sort of mental illness there, but I am not a doctor so I can’t diagnose. But she did seem to be a little bit unstable, so got very angry very quickly…

I feel like Tybee seems a bit more earnest than Travis to some degree here; at first I was worried at the mention of her starting to record, but making sure there was a record of events in case the cops get called and capturing any potential brutality from them is a fairly good call if you think it’s likely to happen, all told. I think we’ve all been in awkward situations with homeless folks who need more grace and patience than the rest of society is willing to give them. An old homeless woman recently came up to me saying she thought I looked like a saint and begged me to forgive her, breaking down into sobbing that she was sorry and refusing any attempts to offer money, food or shelter. She only was satisfied when I performed the quickest, most bastardized ‘blessing’ I could muster after decades away from church, and left me feeling deeply saddened and unsettled that I couldn’t offer more as she took off down the street again. So, good on Tybee at least for thinking about what having the cops called could mean for this woman and taking steps, even if I do think she comes off as more than a little, in her words, WASPy here at points.

Travis cuts in to offer us some words of wisdom from his time working retail:

>Travis: I mean, I-I can tell you, I have worked, uhm, at a couple different restaurants, uhhh, coffee shops, I worked security at Best Buy, uhhmm… I have been- I’ve worked a lot of jobs in which I’ve had to kick people out of places…

Interesting that he says ‘security’ for Best Buy here and not ‘loss prevention,’ was Travis even more of a cop than first assumed? Also, you didn’t just ‘kick out’ that dude at Best Buy, my guy, you fucking called the cops on him, got him arrested, and then touch-down danced your way into a sprained ankle from how hard you went off about serving the carceral state.

>Travis: And, y’know, its- it’s a very- as with most things we talk about, at least from my experience, it’s a very tricky and nuanced situation. Because, at the end of the day… if you worry too much about… being nice and being- and doing the quote ‘right way’ what could happen is the rest of your customers could be inconvenienced or, worse, in some sort of danger. And so- do I think it’s right, in the great, grand scheme of things, of humanity, to kick people out of a place because they seem different? No! I-I don’t. But- I don’t think that’s right, I think that, y’know, it’s unfortunate that that is the case. But that is the case, that is the way that the world works, umm… and I think that when you are an employee of an establishment sometimes it’s your job to kick somebody out. And maybe you don’t want to feel like the bad guy for having to voice ‘I’m kicking you out because you seem different’. Because- I - you seem erratic, because I don’t know what you’re going to do next, and so because of that I don’t want you in a place with all these quote-unquote ‘normal people.’ I think that that- I think that that is an unfortunate thing for a human being to have to say out loud, but sometimes part of your job - because you’re employed- paid- your employer pays you to remove people like that from the premises.

I do love how the Big Dog is edging riiiiiiight up against the idea of ‘you shouldn’t have to be dependent on this system for work and compromise your morals just to appease your boss’ bur rather than take that towards any meaningful critique of capitalism or the existence of such a system, just goes ‘that’s the way the world works, and it sucks but you gotta do what you gotta do to make the money’ as if that isn’t the most status-quo preserving position he could have taken here. And, like, on an individual level? I get that to some degree - I often had to make hard calls like this when I worked at Vons pre-pandemic, and it never felt right but I always did my best to give people as much grace and patience as I could and only ever let the managers be the ones to call the cops when I couldn’t avoid a larger scene. But even as I did that, I still knew this was deeply wrong and that this system does not deserve to exist. I didn’t go ‘eh, well, that’s the way of the world, what ya gonna do?’ and then just put it out of mind. Which it very much sounds like Travis did. Also, again, love how his argument comes down in favor of the employer, given his Best Buy shoplifter incident already mentioned.

Wait, fuck, he’s actually BRINGING IT UP HERE, TOO, hold on, hold the fuck on. Actually, wait… on further listen, this appears to be a SEPARATE story of Travis getting people arrested at Best Buy, I think I’ve just found a plentiful new vein of jerk-ore!

>Travis: I remember when I, uhm, I worked at Best Buy, I got this couple arrested for shoplifting and they we- they had a baby with them who they were pushing around in a stroller, and what they were doing, uhm, was they would put the merchandise in the-

>Tybee: In the stroller?

>Travis: In the cover of the stroller, so the hood, y’know, the thing that folds back and then fold it back so you couldn’t see it. I watched ‘em do it and they had, like, five hundred, six hundred, seven hundred dollars’ worth of stuff hidden in different parts of their stroller. And I had them arrested. I called the cops, cops show up as they were leaving with all this stuff, and so, like, there’s a baby carriage sitting there with a baby while the two of them are in handcuffs. And in that moment I felt FUCKING TERRIBLE. Because, like, okay they’re stealing stuff but I just had these two parents, or these two people with a child, arrested. And THEN I found out that both of them were on parole for doing this same thing multiple times. The man who was there had in fact been arrested two days prior for breaking into cars in the mall parking lot. I bring this up not to say, like, this woman who got kicked out of this coffee shop probably deserved it so you shouldn’t feel bad, but more to say if your job as an employee is to keep things running smoothly, that’s your job. Now, use your best judgement, use your best context, don’t, like, take it upon yourself to be, fuckin’, Roadhouse, The Cooler, like… punch people in the face kind of- or maybe more like The Cooler, from Roadhouse, ‘cause Swayze didn’t just punch people and he tried to be cool about it, y’know, tried to cool out the situation without it coming to blows. But, at the end of the day, like, you’re just not gonna do every situation right, you’re just not gonna handle everything correctly and all you can do is your best. Um, so I don’t know. I wish- I wish that there was, like, textbook, like, ‘Ah, when this happens, say this sentence, it always works,’ but…

Beyond the amazing reveal that, scammers or not, Travis got a couple arrested in front of their child, I once again must point out how his entire argument here is just in favor of the status quo and continually landing on the ‘you are en employee, that’s your job so you just do it’ point. Travis would be an ideal citizen under fascism with how much he seemingly loves to say ‘just follow orders’ here. No consideration for the meaning inherent in ‘degenerate art,’ no worry about the rights of others being sacrificed for his own comfort, no thought as to the ways in which his anti-intellectual disregard for other cultures and peoples contributes to the same culture that now wants to haul people off the streets for the crime of being brown in public.

>Tybee: I wish I trusted the police to do better with mental health and homelessness.

Tybee, how much do you trust the police to begin with? Like, sure, being charitable, she probably means she wishes the police as an institution were better, but once again neither of them can seemingly step through to ‘we don’t need the police as an institution to exist in the first place.’ If anyone sends in an Ask Shmanners on prison abolition, I would be so desperate to hear T4T squirm at it.

>Travis: Yes! I mean, here’s the thing, wh- uh- I- I wish that homelessness wasn’t an issue, I wish that mental health wasn’t an issue, I wish… a lot of things. And- but I think the problem is in wishing those things it’s so easy to get caught up in trying to act as though we lived in a world in which those things weren’t issues that we cause more trouble than we would just acknowledging ‘Yes,’ but until then we do have to deal with it now… and that’s the thing that’s, like, really easy to look at, like, ‘What a shame that that had to happen,’ like, yeah, but, like… it did, because you have to worry about your customers and you have to worry about people feeling comfortable in your establishment so that they’ll come back again and spend more money there so you can afford to pay your rent and, y’know, keep the lights on and pay your employees and stuff, because that coffee shop’s job isn’t to care for people who have issues, it’s to sell coffee to people and make money.

Holy shit, Big Dog, I know the only reason you aren’t gargling capitalism’s balls any further is because you can’t believe you’re not bisexual but this is just… goddamn, man, how are you THIS much into the koolaid for protecting companies you haven’t worked at for at least seven years by the point of this episode’s recording? This would be like if I to this day defended Vons for trying tog et us to come in without masks on because ‘customers feel uncomfortable being asked to wear them and seeing them on employees,’ like we already place farrrrrr too much value on the ‘comfort’ of the ruling class and those on the social hierarchy. Not for nothing that one of the biggest drivers of the current anti-trans bathroom bullshit is cis women feeling ‘uncomfortable’ around trans women and, instead of just sucking it up and dealing with it or unpacking the reasons why later, demanding that these fellow humans be cast out of society once and for all so that they never have to feel the slight discomfort of seeing stubble below lipstick or an Adam’s apple under a cat collar choker or, god forbid, the tasteful outline of a woman’s bulge while she’s going to take a piss. Also, I must stress, this is almost the OPPOSITE position of what he took at the beginning in regards to trigger warnings - ‘well, we can’t spend our lives worried about EVERYONE’s comfort and doing it just for the slightly bad feelings of a smaller group’ one moment, ‘we can’t let the homeless disrupt and scare the poor, sweet, paying customers who might feel the slightest prickle of bummers by seeing someone less well-off within their designated spaces’ the next.

Five minutes left… the light is almost visible here.

>Tybee: Sell coffee to normies.

>Travis: I mean-

>Tybee: Buncha NORMIES!

>Travis: Yeah.

>Tybee: I’m using ’normie’ as a bad word, not as a good word.

>Travis: Yes. Well, ‘cause that’s the thing, is, like, you look at, like, people who go hungry and, like, ‘just give ‘em food!’ It’s like, well, yes! Duh! But, like, who’s paying for that food?! ‘Where’s the-‘ ‘oh, no, just give it to ‘em, they’re hungry!’ Yes, but, like, that’s just not how anything works! I wish it was, I wish it was! But, like, th- if the grocery store just gave away their product, then they can’t afford to pay their employees, and then those employees can’t afford to buy food!

>Tybee: Right.

>Travis: Like… yes, I also wish it wasn’t a problem, but until it isn’t we have to operate within- I’ve talked about this as, like, my issues with money, I think that money is a construct, that, y’know, pieces of paper with ink on them have power because we agree to give them power, it’s a fuckin’ terrible system, BUT IT’S THE SYSTEM WE’VE GOT! And we can’t pretend like it’s not, like- I can’t stop, like, ‘I just don’t believe in money anymore,’ like, that just- I hate the system, I hate taxes, I hate a lot of the way our government works, BUT IT’S WHAT WE’VE GOT! I-It’s- I think it’s Winston Churchill who said, like, ‘Democracy is the worst form of government except all other forms of government,’ something along those lines.

>Tybee: \[laughter\]

>Travis: Yeah, money sucks, but unfortunately it’s the best we’ve come up with so far, and until we figure out something better, there’s still going to be people who can’t afford food, can’t afford housing, and we need to figure out a better way to handle that within the system we’ve got.

First things first, the ACTUAL quote from noted white supremacist and fascist Winston Churchill goes “Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time….”

Second of all... Holy shit. I thought I was like… kinda being a little unfair earlier in calling Travis an ideal subject of fascism, but this honest to god rant about how we must never try to work outside of the system or circumvent it but must only ever perform attempts at reform within it otherwise it’s just a waste of time or otherwise ‘ignoring the world we live in’ to try and build something different outside of established conventions and systems. If ever anyone needed further proof that he’s a neoliberal idiot with no grasp on wider systemic problems and critiques, with no understanding or awareness of political theory and context… here you go, I guess? I’m actually kinda blindsided at how HARD he came for this one, he was fucking getting close to actually shouting a few times there.

Anyhow. We’re finally, mercifully done with what’s likely to become my longest recap, simply because there was just so much in this one.

>Travis: I think that’s enough-

>Tybee: And that’ll do it for us

>Travis. Yeah.

>Tybee: I think we did it. WE SOLVED IT!

>Travis: We fixed everything!

>Tybee: It’s all done now, everyone.

>Travis: We don’t have a- we don’t have any thing else to talk about, that- we’ve solved everything we’ve ever been mad at.

>Tybee: Everything is on a spectrum, good, bad, everything. It’s alllll a spectrum.

The two of them sign out with a promise of a ‘group-bang’ for next week’s episode, and my sphincter just twisted itself into a knot hearing that.

>Travis: You know what? Good news, Tybee. Even though we’re run out of things to talk about because we fixed everything, I believe next week is a group-bang.

>Tybee: Group-bang and special guest!

>Travis: Oooh, yeah! So, we’ll be able to rely on what they wanna talk about, so if you have topics tweet them at us u/Interrobangcast, um, with hashtag ‘group-bang’ so we can find it, um… then post it in the Facebook group, s-so we can talk about it.

Please never say 'hashtag group-bang' ever again, I'm begging the both of you.

They joke about how Tybee hates having to dig through old emails, tell the listeners to submit again if their topic never came up, then they… mention they’re Patreon?! WAIT, SO IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A MCELCAST TO HAVE A PATREON?!?!?! Has the Podfather, Jesstopher Thorn, been informed of this madness?! Surely it goes against his iron-willed reign over the fiefdom of MaxFun.

Oh, god… Travis apparently cannot end the episode without one last barrage of psychic damage to hurl at me like flaming canznonshot during a broadside.

>Travis: You can become a Patreon- our Patron-

>Tybee: A Patron. On our Patreon-

>Travis: You can become a Patrõn, uhm, a Patronus-

>Tybee: You can- a Patronus, for us. You know what I would like-

>Travis: OH MY GOD, THAT WOULD BE SO MUCH FUCKING BETTER! WHY ISN’T IT -

>Tybee: Why aren’t we calling it that-

>Travis: Alright, ssshhh! Fuck, that’s better!

>Tybee: Wait wait wait, wait wait wait wait, wait wait wait wait wait - if you become a Patron, please pick an animal and put it on the wall of the Patreon feed, and you’ve picked your Patronus.

>Travis: YES! We’ll start a thread for that, too, it’ll all be there.

God. God, this episode has been some of the most concentrated and weaponized Vart I’ve dealt with in a while. I foolishly assumed that, after my Runcap, this would be easier, Tybee would get to talk more, there’d be a greater back and forth like in there. That episode was still maybe the most listenable of the recent run of Travcasts I’ve covered, and this one was maybe up there for most unlistenable for the density of bullshit within.

>Travis: And do me a favor, tell a friend about the show. If you like this show, share it with a friend, uhm, maybe go on iTunes, rate, review and subscribe. And just, uh, y’know, keep being great!

( I AM MAKING THIS POST purely because as of my experiences here  and kinda just venting out , joking ,not talking about any particular thing/person/party so don’t take it so seriously)
 
Having a peaceful time or a beautiful place to just chill around while not being hassled outside of cafes is so hard here no walkable places except few or just enjoying nature is so hard in Delhi i am not saying that any city is better or worse but as my family job and life is here i cannot just shift anywhere , its the capital city of  the 4th largest economy and you would think they can do better.

(I am not covering safety for women because its a very big and serious issue and not everything is serious in this post so i don’t wanna degrade the importance of that issue or a lack thereof in the city)

You cannot live here 3 months because of pollution 3 months because of rain.

Istg delhi is the worst game of Russian roulette
 Will you be run over by a rich guy’s car, a maniac in a thar, e rickshaws who have literally 0 road sense, air pollution or would you like an overloaded truck or the best F1 level drivers of the DTC, or if you think its not enough the collapsing infrastructure (actually budget was 4500 cr for that but idk how it made the politicians / middlemen/ contractors rich and the infrastructure is still bad hmmm tough sh to fig out).

Delhi govt / MCD / NDMC / road authorities /PWD actual reaction when rain chokes all the roads and pollution f**s us every year -  :0 whaaaaaaaa but we made committees and rolled out  GRAP without the actual implementation how is it back again we did not do anything last time how did this happen again, we dug up roads without any plan.

Crossing Chankya puri at 2 pm on Wednesday afternoon- sorry wait for an hour because a politician has to go to a sausage fest of competing their ding dongs with their peers in the parliament , who cares if u have a personal emergency you broke peasant common taxpayer.

Delhi police when they have to do their job and there is even a 0.1% of effort is required- ..

Entering CP and trying not to get harassed by beggars and Transgenders ( I know they are underprivileged and a weaker section of the society) but they have made CP a Hell you cannot even hang there anymore without a beggar harassing you touching you or a guy trying to scam you, i get that its very hard for them but thats not a justification for harassing others.

Gk/khan/lodhi/vk/qutub area etc are few places you can still enjoy but again thats because the elites, the politicians, the glorified civil servants live there ( while rest of the delhi is collapsing be it north west east) roads always dug up construction 24/7/365, open cow feces, people harassing scamming at every turn and a lot of other things.

If a survival test show was being made irl delhi sure as shi would be their wet dream

Bureaucrats trying not to replicate British era imperialism challenge: impossible 

Places you can enjoy nature in delhi if you’re wondering- Sunder Nursery, lodhi garden, buddha park (ppl have kinda ruined it but still) , HKV ,  talkatora (if there not a sammelan scheduled there every other day) and only in some parts of the year ( there are a lot of parks in colonies residential areas but there are a lot of restrictions in most of them)

Want to play with your friends in a park - congratulations in almost most of these parks guards / local people don’t let you play cricket football badminton and I’ve experienced it on my own (except hkv lodhi that too sometimes)

Love cycling- DEAL WITH EVERYTHING MENTIONED ABOVE

north Delhi- no beautiful place there are some decent malls and markets thats all a place with no excitement and personality ( i don’t mean from a standpoint of living there)

East delhi -  ive been to a few very good places to eat here although majority east Delhi is a dystopia ( me trying not to get killed in welcome/ shahdra/ ISBT/ seelampur could have been the best place in the city due to yamuna but people/ govt have made it a hell. 
(Although in some parts of east Delhi i have seen beautiful and well maintained res areas but thats 1% of it ig)

West Delhi - residential areas with some good iconic markets and some of the best places to eat, although it has a lot of shitty parts still there are some really cool places here 

Old Delhi- There is history and heritage but i can never get how the hell people actually have  a good time there (literally so cramped chaotic unsafe and mostly over rated food places)

Mkt- its alright, it gets boring after 2-4 times there is a lot of stuff you can buy here although have never shopped here personally but still have had some good mornings there so can’t say much

DU north campus / Hudson lane -decent just have some nostalgia and yeah you can actually feel the college life there and as a regular citizen its mehhh after a while

There are some beautiful walking places around du ridge civil lines tho they go hard man 

Punjabi bagh - i never understood the hype or the place 

Lutyens- the most beautiful part of Delhi(obvious reasons)

Malls - if you enjoy malls then you’ll find plenty but i don’t like hanging out in soulless consumeristic wet dreams so thats on me

I am saying all this because I see a beautiful city with a lot of potential heritage or whatever and just the basic of human need good air, a hit of sunshine at 4 pm through trees with a coffee in your hand, decent infrastructure ( except delhi metro there is no good public infrastructure)
 
Don’t care enough to comment about noida gurugram or rest of the NCR which no one cares about because they are practically new cities with no originality and personality, sad block buildings and big roads does not mean a good city

1o3dw00,https://i.redd.it/fhekolr8tcuf1.jpeg,An autopsy of Zeishan Qadri's definition of strong women & why Neelam and Tanya are the worst precedents for how women should treat men,"By now, we all know that Neelam loses her calm when she gets nominated. It's very similar to a young school girl whose face turns plum-red when faced with a stressful situation.

But today's episode revealed that Zeishan doens't only lose his calm but gets *flabbergasted*, hyperventilates, and turns dead-body-pale, when things don't go according to his plan.

Making Shehbaaz or Nehal was his grand plan, his house of cards that he was building in the whirlwinds of the house. So when the time came, he didn't not write Nehal's name to be eliminated from the race because Tanya didn't want to become the captain, but he wrote Tanya's name because he wanted to have an upper hand over Nehal during the captaincy. Now according to Zeishan's logic, he didn't betray Tanya or act against her.

This should have sent Tanya reeling but what actually undid her and Neelam was Amal's omission of their very names, even above Kunickaa's, during the speech he gave for winning the car. And swiftly came down the hand of justice as Neelam and Tanya raised their hands for Gaurav to win the car.

Qadri lost it. Upon being confronted (too strong a word to choose for how Neemal does this) by Neelam about Amal not mentioning their names, Qadri says, ""Gadi ke liye mar rahe hain kya? Yaha baat vote ka hai. Idhar (in Danube) dimag wala log baith ta hai. Agar dimag wala baat nahi karna toh ekdam bahar niklo. Hamara darwaza band hai hamesha ke liye."" 

Neelam, instead of shouting back, pouncing on this shortbread biscuit of a man, became smaller in posture, sank in her chair, went silent, got intimidated and got plum-red like she is the one who had stepped a boundary.

Okay, agreed, Neelam and Tanya do, from time-to-time discuss with each other their dislike for Zeishan's behaviour, but on his face, their spines have always bent over backwards, in respect and fear. 

Till date, Tanya's sorrow is that he didn't respond to her even when she called out to him with ""sir, sir"" repeatedly. Her sorrow isn't how she has been treated. 

Zeishan has often boasted of having known real strong women, citing his mother, sisters, and more women as worthy examples. His image of strong women has been women dons with guns in their hands. He has taken pride over the women character of his movies but his treatment of women in this reality show is the complete opposite.

He has asked women to make his coffees, parathas, steam iron his clothes, follow his orders, listen to his non-stop monologues and more. He has kept them, firmly, under his thumb, which as Malti puts it from her deep knowledge of astrology is, ""a don's thumb"".

The case is that men like Zeishan know talking about what kind of women will show them as progressive but they want the women to progress under their control in real life.

When it comes to Tanya and Neelam, they couldn't be worse examples of how women should be treated. At this point, there inclusion in the show should be questioned for how they served men relentlessly in the show, setting a problematic standard. Even after being disrespected, they have babied them, fed them halwas forcefully, coddled them to their beds, and come back to sit at their feet after no matter how they have been dealt with.

This country already suffers from boys and men who were babied beyond repair to grow up into adults who scream, throw tantrums and are walking man-children. In this context, women like Tanya and Neelam should be felt sorry for but they should be criticised and called out even more for the damage they keep doing daily. 

It's painful to bear Zeishan, but it's impossible to accept Tanya and Neelam. They should be utterly, deeply ashamed.

And how do I fix it,"Quick story, Around June I experienced a panic attack from hyperventilating while eating. It happened twice that week , er said its anxiety. And ofc I’d get air hunger while eating every time . So I did research and went to the GI doctor which then diagnosed me with Chronic Mild Gastritis and Esophagitis, with Gerd. This was around August btw so 2 months with no idea . So I got on PPI and low fod diet. After a month I got off them, and no more bloating, dizziness(imbalance), and air hunger while eating . 

Now here’s my issue:
Since then I’ve been deep breathing constantly ever day to the point where it feels bad if I don’t. I’m in a loop where I have to and if I’m out the same goes, but I noticed I get inner doom or anxiety outside since then. So now walking feels hard. 

I’m now trying to not deep breathe and balance my Co2 levels naturally and it helped me while going out and at home! But sometimes it feels hard or as if I’m manually monitoring. Do yall experienced this? I’m still eating clean just in case it’s gastritis bc idk if I’m healed or not I tried eating junk food and I felt normal but then shitty a week after . I cut off coffee too

Is it Histamine intolerance and MCAS
Acid Reflux 
Or Hyperventilating anxiety 

Bc I wake up pretty normal my breathing till I take a deep breath and then I’m back to monitoring. It goes away when I’m distracted too

1o3dv7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o3dv7c/no_women_in_blackwood_part_1_rewritten/,No Women in Blackwood ~ {Part 1 Rewritten},"**A/N:** *Hello, all! I got some really great feedback on this story, and so I decided to do a full rewrite of it! The entirety of part 1! I changed a ton.*

If you’re reading this, I’m already dead. Right now, I’m climbing the spiral staircase to the topmost floor of the lighthouse at the edge of town. When I reach the lantern room, I’ll throw myself to the jagged rocks below. Better to be claimed by the sea than enslaved to that thing.

As I am the last one of my bloodline left alive, I feel it is my obligation to tell the story of its extinction before I, too, choose to succumb.

I am a fifty-six-year-old man from a small seaside town in California called Blackwood. For the safety of my family, I dare not reveal my name. Or, rather, what is *left* of my family. From this point on, I will only be known as Anon.

It was July of 1983, and I was fourteen—an age when most boys were sneaking beers at parties, hanging around arcades, or cutting class for afternoons at the beach. Blackwood wasn’t like most towns, though.

Blackwood sat on a crooked stretch of California coast where the fog rolled in thick and salt-sticky, clinging to your clothes like cobwebs. Our lives bent around the sea. The fishermen went out before dawn, their boats groaning like tired beasts as they cut into the waves. By afternoon, the docks were alive with gutted catch, gulls screaming overhead, and the sharp stink of brine and blood. Tourists came and went, paying us to clean their fish, to fry their fish, to pack it in ice. It wasn’t much, but it kept the lights on. Fishing was Blackwood’s heart. Fishing was its breath.

The town was small. You knew every face, every name. Strangers stuck out like splinters. A man could walk from one end of Main Street to the other in under ten minutes, and in that time, he’d nod to at least three people he’d known since kindergarten. Blackwood was tight, suffocatingly so. Everybody knew everybody’s business, or thought they did. Secrets didn’t stay hidden here—not the ordinary kind.

The sheriff and his men kept order the way iron keeps order: blunt, cold, unyielding. Hard-asses, all of them. Sheriff Callahan, in particular, carried himself like the law wasn’t just something he upheld, but something he was. His deputies—the “cronies,” as we called them—were copies cut from the same miserable cloth. No fun allowed. If you were caught with beer, they’d tan your hide twice: once at the station, once when your old man found out.

At fourteen, I was already working. Everyone did. The town’s sons were expected to earn their keep early, learning the trades that kept Blackwood alive. My place was at Hartley’s Fish Shop, a squat shack that smelled permanently of salt, guts, and fryer grease. Tourists wandered in with their striped bass and halibut, grinning wide with the pride of their catch. My job was to gut the fish, scale them, and wrap them neatly. I was quick with a knife by the time I was twelve.

Vince would come by the shop sometimes. Vince had been my best friend since we were five, inseparable since the day we shared a box of crayons in Mr. Green’s kindergarten class. When my father knocked me down, Vince picked me up. When his own house filled with too much shouting, he slipped out with me into the night. We weren’t just friends—we were halves of the same whole. By fourteen, I trusted him more than I trusted blood. If I ever got into any trouble, he would be the guy I'd go to without a second thought.

We had others in our circle, too. Gregory—skinny as a pole, always with a pocketknife in his hands, carving little figures into driftwood during class. Robert—big shoulders, booming laugh, more loyal than clever, but you’d never doubt he’d throw himself in front of a car for you. And then there was John.

John was trouble. A chain smoker at fourteen, his fingertips already stained yellow, his voice rasping like gravel. The kind of boy teachers gave up on. The kind our fathers warned us against, though we kept him around anyway. Maybe out of pity, maybe out of habit. Vince always said we could help him. I thought John was a drowning man who didn’t want saving. But he was still one of us, in his way. He'd sneak us a few cigarettes, let us borrow his lighter so we could burn paper, and would give us money we could blow on huge milkshakes. I know it's fucked up, but in a sense, we were using the guy.

Blackwood itself… it wasn’t the kind of place you leave. Not because you loved it, but because it clung to you like tar. The streets sagged with peeling paint, salt-stained windows, and buildings patched with whatever the ocean hadn’t yet claimed. The town hall doubled as a post office. The school was a squat brick thing where the smell of seawater soaked the halls year-round, no matter how hard the janitors scrubbed. The diner on Main had duct tape holding the booths together, and the jukebox had been broken since ’79.

And then there was the old café.

It sat on the corner of Fifth and Alder, locked up and forgotten. Once, it must’ve been a proud little place—the sign above the door was still faintly visible: Blackwood Café. But by the eighties, it was nothing but a husk. Wood patched with warped boards, cloth ties holding the front awning in place, windows clouded with grime. No one went there anymore. No one cared to fix it. Like much of Blackwood, it was left to rot.

I remember the day Vince showed up at Hartley’s. The bell over the door jingled, and there he was, hands stuffed in his jacket, grin crooked.

“Come on,” he said, leaning against the counter while I gutted a cod. “You’re rotting away in here. Let’s go do something fun.”

I smirked, wiped my hands on my apron. “Define fun.”

“Couple beers. Old café downtown. Nobody to bother us.”

I should’ve said no. My father would beat me raw if I came home smelling of alcohol. But Vince had that way about him—when he wanted you along, you didn’t refuse.

By sundown, we were at the café. The windows were boarded, but a little force cracked the rotten wood. We climbed in through the broken glass, careful not to cut ourselves. Inside, the place was worse than I’d imagined. Wallpaper sagged with mold, ceiling beams wrapped in wire and cloth to keep them from collapsing. Barstools leaned at odd angles, their leather split, stuffing spilling out. The smell was damp, mildew, rust. The smell of a place long dead.

We cracked open our beers, sitting on stools that rocked beneath our weight. The bottles were warm and tasted like piss, but we drank anyway. The conversation was easy, the kind of dumb chatter boys fall into when they’re trying too hard to be men. We cursed about school, about how the new arcade game sucked, about the sheriff breathing down our necks for nothing. Vince made a joke about how we were kings in our castle, rulers of all this rot; gods amongst the rats.

We laughed.

But then John came in.

The window creaked as he slid through, his frame thin, shadowed. For a moment, I thought he’d just come to bum a drink, light a cigarette, sit with us in our ruin. But the look on his face froze me.

Vacant. Hollow. His eyes were glassy, his expression slack. He muttered under his breath, words I couldn’t make out. Not English. Not anything I knew. Just sound, low and ragged.

Vince said something—I don’t remember what. John didn’t answer. He stopped in the middle of the floor, still muttering, and slowly turned his gaze on us.

I couldn’t move. Neither of us could.

He bent down, picked up a shard of broken glass from the floor... and then, without hesitation, he pressed it to his forearm.

The skin split with a sound like tearing cloth. Blood welled up, bright and obscene in the dim café light. He dragged the glass downward, not wild, not random—deliberate. Line by line, stroke by stroke, like some fucked up painter doing an art project.

I'm not squeamish; hell, I cut up fish for a living, but the sight of my friend's blood dripping to the floor caused sour bile to rise in my throat.

At first, it looked like letters, but not any alphabet I’d ever seen. Too crooked. Too angular. The cuts crisscrossed in patterns that made my stomach roll, jagged intersecting lines that bent at unnatural angles. A star that wasn’t a star. A spiral that seemed to double back on itself, curling tighter and tighter until my eyes watered. My brain told me the shapes were nonsense, but something deeper told me they meant something. Something old.

Blood ran into the grooves, filling them, so the shapes glistened wet and red, shining like they’d always been waiting beneath his skin, just needing to be uncovered.

John’s lips moved faster, his muttering climbing into a hiss. Words I didn’t know, syllables that didn’t belong to any tongue. Some high, some low, like two voices speaking through him at once. His pupils dilated until his eyes were almost black, unblinking, fixed on me.

I should’ve stopped him. God knows I should’ve. But my legs were leaden. My arms were stone. I sat frozen on that stool, watching as though through glass, my heart hammering but my body dead. I was sick with horror, but I couldn’t look away.

It wasn’t just John. It was as if something else sat behind his movements, something guiding his hand, shaping the lines with his blood. The café around us seemed to blur, the shadows stretching longer, the smell of saltwater thick in my throat, though we were nowhere near the sea.

He carved until the glass squealed against bone.

Vince cursed, his voice breaking. He shoved back his stool, stumbling for the window. “I’ll get help—” he shouted, already gone, his footsteps pounding into the night.

And still I sat, caught between terror and awe, as John raised his bloody arm toward me. His mouth worked around another string of guttural syllables, and the pattern—God help me—the pattern seemed to move. Just for a second, the lines writhed on his skin like they weren’t cuts at all but something alive beneath him, trying to crawl free.

That broke me. I lunged, knocking him back. We crashed to the filthy floor, glass skittering from his grip. My hands locked around his wrist, his blood slick and hot against my skin. He thrashed weakly, still muttering, still staring straight through me with eyes too wide, and may God strike me down if I'm wrong or lying, but I could have sworn they turned black. Not like the purple you get around the eyes when some dickhead leaves you a shiner, I mean, inky black. The horror movie type of shit.

Now, I had seen some shit in my life by that point that made it so I didn't scare easily. My dad is an abusive drunk, I've seen druggies with makeshift blades rambling about raptures, and I even saw a catfish with human teeth once.

But this?

I damn-near pissed myself.

A familiar sound brought me back to reality and out of my terrified stupor, which in hindsight I am thankful for.

The sound of footsteps. Heavy. Deliberate.

Vince had returned. And this time he wasn’t alone.

The cops were with him.

\* \* \*

The cuffs clicked around my wrists. Cold, too tight. They didn’t even bother with John—he was hauled off limp, half-conscious, his bloodied arm wrapped in an old rag. I remember the way it dripped onto the floorboards of the café as they dragged him out, leaving streaks and spatters like some grotesque trail leading back to the window we’d broken in through.

Vince and I didn’t resist. We just followed, silent, our shoes crunching on glass and dirt as Sheriff Callahan’s cronies led us out into the fog. The night air slapped me clean after the suffocating rot inside the café, but it didn’t matter—I could still smell blood. I could still smell salt, too, thick and heavy though the ocean was half a mile away.

They shoved us into the back of a cruiser. The ride to the station wasn’t long. Blackwood wasn’t big enough for any ride to be long. Still, those minutes stretched endlessly. Vince stared at his knees, chewing the inside of his cheek the way he did when he was scared but didn’t want to admit it. I just kept seeing John’s face, slack-jawed and black-eyed, mouthing words that didn’t belong to him. My stomach turned over.

The station sat squat across from the diner, a square brick box with a flagpole out front and a single yellow light burning above the double doors. The light hummed, spitting moths against the glass.

Inside, the air was thick with coffee and cigarettes. The linoleum was cracked, the kind of checkerboard that might’ve been white and green once but had long since faded to piss-yellow and sickly gray. The deputies moved slowly, tired, like this was all routine, just another Friday night scraping kids off the street.

Then Callahan walked in.

The sheriff was a broad man, not tall, but built like he’d been carved out of oak. His hair was iron-gray, buzzed short, his mustache thick and stern. He wore his badge like it was part of his body, gleaming on his chest. His eyes—cold, pale blue—swept over Vince and me like we were nothing worth the effort of looking at.

He planted himself across the desk from us, leaned forward, and folded his hands. The wood creaked under his weight.

“Well,” he said, voice gravelly, steady. “You two sure stirred up some trouble tonight.”

“Sheriff, it wasn’t—” I started.

“Quiet.” He didn’t raise his voice. Didn’t need to. The word landed like a slap. “I don’t want excuses. I want the truth.”

Vince glanced at me. I swallowed. My throat felt raw.

“We weren’t—” I tried again, softer. “It was John. He—he went off. He was cutting himself. We didn’t do anything—”

Callahan’s stare drilled into me, unblinking. “You break into city property?”

I hesitated. My silence was enough.

“You drink inside?”

Another silence.

He sighed, leaned back in his chair, and pinched the bridge of his nose. For a moment, I thought I saw something almost human in him—tiredness, disappointment, maybe even pity. But then it was gone, shuttered away.

“Let me tell you something, son,” he said. “When I was your age, boys got their thrills chopping wood or throwing rocks at tin cans. Not breaking into condemned buildings and desecrating themselves like… that.”

“It wasn’t us,” Vince said quickly, his voice tight. “Sheriff, I swear to God. John just—he wasn’t himself. He was saying things—”

Callahan’s head snapped toward him. “You listen good, Vincent. You keep the Lord’s name out of your mouth unless you’re in church. Understand?”

Vince nodded, his jaw tight.

The sheriff studied us both for a long moment. Then he rose, his chair groaning behind him. He paced to the holding cell, where they’d stashed John. I craned my neck. Through the bars, I could see John slumped on the cot, his head bowed, his arm wrapped in bandages. His lips still moved, whispering, even in sleep—or whatever state he was in.

Callahan turned back. “You two are lucky you’re not the ones bleeding out right now.”

“We didn’t—” I tried again. My voice cracked. “Sheriff, I swear, we didn’t make him do it. He just… snapped.”

For the first time, Callahan’s face softened, but it wasn’t kindness. It was that same look my father gave me when I lied about a broken window: not fooled, not angry—just weary.

“Boys don’t just snap,” he said flatly. “Not unless something puts them up to it. And between the liquor, the trespassing, and the company you keep…” His gaze flicked to me, sharp, accusatory. “…I’d say there’s plenty to answer for.”

He motioned to one of his deputies. “Call the fathers.”

The words sank into me like stones. My stomach knotted. Vince’s face went pale.

I thought about my old man, sitting at the kitchen table, a cigarette glowing in the dark, waiting for the phone to ring.

I thought about the sound his belt made when he slid it through the loops.

The deputy picked up the phone without looking at us, his fingers yellow from nicotine, dialing like he’d done it a thousand times. The sound of each click on the rotary was a countdown. I could already see my father’s face, already feel the shadow of his hand.

Callahan stayed by the desk, arms folded, his pale eyes steady as a nail. Vince stared straight ahead at the wall, jaw clenched. His knee kept bouncing, faster and faster, until Callahan’s gaze snapped to him. Vince froze.

The sheriff didn’t need to shout to fill a room. His voice was low, but it carried like weight. “I told you boys years ago to stay out of that place. Now one of your friends is damn near cut to ribbons and you’re sitting in my station stinking of warm beer like gutter rats.” He leaned closer, elbows on his knees, his stare flicking between me and Vince. “Do you know how this looks?”

“We didn’t make him do it,” I said, but it came out weak.

Callahan’s mouth curled—not a smile, but something that wanted to be. “That’s not what I asked.”

The deputy hung up the phone. “Hank’s on his way,” he muttered.

My heart dropped at the name. Hank. My father.

The sheriff’s expression didn’t change. “Good,” he said. “We’ll let him sort you out.” He straightened, dusting invisible crumbs from his hands. “You boys sit tight. You’re not under arrest. Yet. But you’re not walking out either.”

He turned toward the holding cell. John was still slumped on the cot, his head bowed, lips moving. He looked like a scarecrow left in a field too long—skin gray, blood seeping through the bandage on his arm. His whispering was low, broken, but constant. I couldn’t make out words. Not really. Just sounds. Wet, dragging sounds, like someone trying to speak through water.

“Jesus,” one of the deputies muttered, staring.

“Don’t blaspheme,” Callahan snapped without looking back.

I tore my eyes from John and fixed them on the linoleum. The checkerboard squares were worn smooth where a hundred boots had scuffed them, and each green square faded to a sickly brown. Cigarette burns peppered the floor like little craters. This was the kind of place where kids got dragged for curfew violations, shoplifting, and bar fights. Not whatever this was.

The door banged open.

My father filled the frame.

He wasn’t a big man, not the way Callahan was, but he had a way of taking up a room all the same. Shoulders hunched forward like he’d been bent over a boat his whole life, face lined deep from salt and wind. His shirt was stained, his hands still smelling of diesel and bait. The stink of whiskey hit before his voice.

“What’d he do?” he asked the room, not me.

Callahan stepped forward. “Trespassing. Drinking. He and Vincent were with John Greeley when it happened.”

My father’s head turned slowly, eyes narrowing at me. “What happened?”

Callahan didn’t answer. He just stepped aside so my father could see the cell. John sat there, still whispering, blood dark on the bandage.

For a moment, my father didn’t move. He just stared. Then he exhaled through his nose, long and slow, and turned his eyes on me again.

“You do this?” he asked. His voice wasn’t loud, but it cut sharper than shouting.

“No,” I said quickly. “We didn’t touch him. He came in like that. We tried to stop him.”

“You tried,” he said. “But you still went in there. You still drank.”

“I—” My mouth went dry.

He took two steps forward, close enough that I could smell the ocean on him, the stale liquor. His eyes were bloodshot, dark as wet stone. “You got any idea what kind of fool you made me look like tonight?”

I kept my eyes on the floor. “We didn’t—”

“Look at me.”

I forced my head up. His stare was cold, steady, a net thrown over me.

“You want to act like a man?” he said. “Then you get treated like one.”

Callahan’s voice cut in. “Easy, Hank.”

My father didn’t take his eyes off me. “You keep your station, Sheriff,” he said, his tone polite but flat. “This one’s mine.”

Callahan stepped closer, his boots scraping the tile. “While he’s under my roof, he’s mine. Don’t forget that.”

They stood like that for a heartbeat—Callahan with his hands on his belt, my father with his fists at his sides. Two men built from the same hard stuff, just wearing different uniforms.

Finally, my father exhaled through his nose again. “Fine,” he said. “Let’s go.”

Callahan gestured at the cuffs. One of the deputies stepped forward and unlocked them, the metal biting my wrists as it came off. My hands tingled as the blood returned.

“Thank the sheriff,” my father said.

I muttered, “Thank you,” without looking up.

Callahan didn’t answer. He was already staring back at John, his brow furrowed, like he was trying to puzzle something out.

My father grabbed my arm, not gently, and steered me toward the door. Vince looked at me, eyes wide, but didn’t say a word.

We stepped outside.

The night was thick with fog. The ocean’s roar was distant but steady, the air wet and cold. My father’s grip dug into my arm as he pulled me toward the truck parked under the yellow streetlight. Neither of us spoke.

My stomach churned. My wrists burned where the cuffs had been. John’s blood, John’s whispering, the shapes he carved—they all followed me out into the night.

When my father shoved me into the truck and slammed the door, I realized my hands were still shaking.

He climbed in beside me, the cab reeking of salt, oil, and whiskey. He started the engine, the old motor coughing, and for a long moment we just sat there, the headlights cutting pale beams through the fog.

Then, without looking at me, he said, “You’re gonna tell me exactly what the hell happened in there.”

His voice was low, almost calm, but I knew that tone. That was the tone he used before the belt.

I stared out the window at the moths circling the streetlight and tried to swallow the taste of salt in my mouth.

The truck rumbled out of the lot, the headlights catching the fog like smoke. Blackwood’s streets were near empty at this hour—just a few scattered lamps, yellow pools in the gray, and the occasional shape of a house with its porch light burning. The engine’s groan filled the silence between us. I sat stiff in the passenger seat, my hands in my lap, fingers digging into each other.

“You break into that café.” His voice came flat, like he was reciting facts. Not a question.

“Yes, sir.”

“You drank.”

“Yes, sir.”

He nodded once, eyes never leaving the road. The wheel squeaked when he turned it, his calloused hand wrapped tight.

“And John cut himself up in front of you.”

“Yes, sir.”

The words sounded pitiful in my own mouth. Too clean for what had happened. Like I was reporting to school instead of trying to explain why my friend was lying in a cell, whispering like something hollowed him out.

My father sucked on his teeth. The smell of whiskey came off him strong in the cab’s heat. “You ever think maybe you’re not as clever as you think? You go where you’re told not to, you drink what you’re told not to, and now the whole damn town’s gonna be talking about it. About you. About me.”

“I didn’t—”

“Don’t.” His hand tightened on the wheel. “Don’t try to lie pretty. I can smell it on you.”

We passed the diner. The neon sign hummed and sputtered in the fog, half the letters dead, so it only read *DI\_\_*. A couple of drunks stood outside smoking, their faces pale in the glow. They watched the truck crawl past like buzzards.

“Boy like John,” my father said after a long silence, “he’s a crack in the wall. You can see it coming years before it breaks. You don’t go standing under it, waiting for it to fall on you. You hear me?”

“Yes, sir.”

But my mind wasn’t on John. It was back in that café, on the way, the cuts on his arm had glistened in the dim light, too sharp and deliberate to be random. It was on the sound of his whispering, still carrying even when his eyes had rolled back.

“You’re gonna keep your damn distance from him,” my father said, voice lowering. “You and Vince both. That boy’s a rot. And rot spreads.”

I nodded, though I knew Vince would never let go of John, not really. Vince had that stubborn hope about him, the kind that thought you could drag someone out of the water even if they were already gone under.

The truck climbed the hill out of town, the ocean on one side, the woods on the other. The trees looked wrong in the fog—taller, darker, pressed in close like they were leaning over the road to watch us pass. Every so often, the headlights caught their trunks, pale and slick, like bones standing upright.

My father cracked his window, flicked his cigarette butt out, and lit another. The flare of the lighter briefly lit the lines on his face, carved deep like someone had etched them in salt and anger.

“You’re lucky,” he said finally. “Lucky Callahan didn’t keep you. He’s a mean son of a bitch, but fair. If it were up to me, I’d have left you in that cell overnight. Let you listen to your friend mutter himself hoarse.”

I didn’t answer. My tongue felt thick, as if I spoke the words might twist wrong in the air.

The truck crested the hill, and through the fog I could just barely see the lighthouse out on the point. Its beam cut slow arcs through the night, pale and tired. For a moment, I thought I saw the light catch on something else—something darker, taller than the trees—but then it passed, and there was only fog again.

My father downshifted, the gears grinding. “When we get home,” he said, “you go straight to your room. Tomorrow, you work the nets at dawn. No friends, no excuses. You need reminding of what keeps a man straight, I’ll remind you.”

“Yes, sir,” I muttered.

The words tasted like rust.

The truck rattled down toward the coast road, and I kept my eyes on the lighthouse beam. I told myself it was only the fog, only the tricks of a tired mind. But the longer I watched, the more I felt like something in that café had followed us out. Something sitting just past the reach of the light, waiting.

And though I didn’t dare say it, I was starting to wonder if John hadn’t been the only one whispering that night.

\* \* \*

The road home was a tunnel of fog and headlights. The beams of my father’s old Ford barely cut ten feet ahead before the mist swallowed them whole, a pale wall shifting and breathing like something alive. The wipers screeched across the glass with every swipe, a thin, wet squeal that set my teeth on edge. My father’s hands were clamped on the wheel, knuckles pale, jaw flexing every time I moved beside him. The radio was off, but the truck still hummed—a low, rattling drone under everything, like it wanted to speak but couldn’t.

We passed the harbor. Through the cracked window came the smell of brine, oil, and rotting kelp. The boats sat as black shapes against the docks, their ropes groaning against the tide, their masts vanishing into the gray. Somewhere above, a gull cried—a thin, brittle sound that died midair as if cut short.

We didn’t speak. Not at the harbor. Not on the dirt road to the bluffs. Not when the squat shape of our house emerged from the fog like a shipwreck. The porch light flickered, weak and indecisive, its glow barely reaching the steps.

When he killed the engine, the silence hit harder than the noise had.

“Inside,” he said.

I followed him in. The floorboards creaked under our boots. The smell of old fish and cheap tobacco clung to the walls. He dropped his keys on the table—just a clatter of metal, but sharp enough to make me flinch. He didn’t look at me. Didn’t even turn his head. Just stood there for a long moment, staring at nothing, jaw still working like a machine that couldn’t shut off.

Finally, in a voice that wasn’t angry, wasn’t anything at all, he said, “Go to bed.”

I waited for the belt. Waited for him to change his mind. But he didn’t move. His back stayed to me, the muscles in his neck coiled and still.

I went to my room. Closed the door.

The window was cracked, letting in the night air. The fog pressed against the glass like a living thing, crawling slowly, smearing everything into vague shapes. I peeled off my shirt, lay down, and stared at the ceiling. My wrists still throbbed where the cuffs had bitten into them. My mind replayed John’s arm, John’s blood, John’s whispering lips. His eyes—empty and full all at once.

I don’t remember falling asleep.

The dream didn’t arrive—it was just there.

I was standing in a corridor.

It stretched forever, a tunnel of damp earth and pale light. The walls weren’t walls at all but skulls. Thousands of them. The teeth locked together like a puzzle. Their hollow eyes followed me as I walked, deep and endless. Fog hung in the air, thick and cold enough to taste.

My footsteps didn’t echo.

Something moved at the far end—slow, massive. Taller than the walls. Its outline wavered in the mist, hunched and shifting, like a mountain dragging itself through mud. Every time I tried to focus, the dream blurred, as if it refused to let me see.

Then came the whispering.

Faint at first, like water trickling through stone. Then clearer, curling through the fog like smoke.

*Library…*

I froze. The word came from everywhere and nowhere at once, vibrating in my bones.

*Row fifteen.*

The skulls all turned at once.

Their mouths opened, dry and slow. Bone cracked and grated as they began to reshape. Tendons knit themselves from nothing. Eyes bloomed wet and bright in the sockets. Flesh crawled over the skulls like worms building a face.

And I saw—

They weren’t men. Not one.

Every skull became a face. Every face, a woman’s. Old, young, all wrong. Their eyes too wide, their lips too still. They blinked in perfect unison, the sound like insects brushing their wings.

The whispering became a single voice, thousands speaking as one:

***He waits where they buried the truth.***

Their mouths stretched wider, impossibly wide, until the sound turned into a scream that wasn’t sound at all—it was vibration, pressure, something that made my chest seize and my ears ring.

Behind them, the fog shifted. Something vast stirred. I felt its breath first—warm, damp, smelling of salt and decay. The ground trembled. The faces turned toward it, mouths still gaping.

***DON’T TRUST THEM!***

They shrieked it as one, eyes flashing white—

And I woke up.

I was upright in bed, drenched in sweat. The window rattled. My chest heaved, lungs dragging in air that still smelled faintly of the sea.

Somewhere below, my father coughed. The creak of his chair followed.

Outside, the fog pressed against the glass like a living skin.

I wiped my face with shaking hands. My nails dug into my palms, just to remind myself I was awake.

The words still rang in my skull.

*Library. Row fifteen.*

Every time I blinked, I saw the corridor again, the skulls, the faces—their mouths stretched wide in that final scream.

When morning came, I didn’t move for a long time. The light was dull and pale, filtered through fog that hadn’t lifted since the night before. Even the gulls were silent. Even the sea sounded far away, like it wanted nothing to do with us.

Lying there, staring at the cracks in the ceiling, I kept thinking about what I saw. The faces. The voices. The word Library.

And then something else hit me. Something I’d never really thought about before.

Every face in that corridor had been a woman’s.

And there weren’t any women in Blackwood.

Not one.

We learned about them in school, sure. History lessons full of names and faces—scientists, leaders, painters, all long dead. There were pictures in the old textbooks, faded and grainy. We’d memorize their contributions, their eras, their quotes. But that was it.

No one ever said where they’d gone.

No one in town ever said much of anything about it.

You could live your whole life in Blackwood without hearing the word woman spoken out loud. It sat heavy in everyone’s throats, something they all chose to swallow.

When you’re a kid, you don’t notice things like that. The world’s small, and you just take it the way it’s given. But once you do start noticing, once you start asking—well, that’s when things start to happen.

Jeremiah was the first one who ever asked out loud.

Jeremiah was the first one who ever asked out loud.

He’d been part of our group—me, Vince, John, and him. Smart kid. Too curious for his own good. Always asking questions no one else would. Always poking at the edges of things people pretended didn’t exist.

One afternoon, after class, we were sitting behind the gym, the sun low, cutting gold across the harbor. Jeremiah squinted at the water.

“How come there’s no women in Blackwood?”

We laughed. Nervously, awkwardly. It sounded like a joke. His face didn’t move. He didn’t laugh. Not a twitch.

“I’m serious,” he said. “We’ve never seen one. Not a single one.”

John scoffed. Vince shrugged. Maybe they lived somewhere else. But Jeremiah wouldn’t let it go. He asked the teachers. Then the pastor. Then old man Duffy, who ran the bait shop. Every adult gave him the same look. Not angry. Not annoyed. Just… warning. The kind that curls cold in your stomach, that sits behind your ribs and presses, saying, *stop*.

And then one night, it happened. His father found him on the living room floor. Heart attack. Sixteen years old.

The coroner said it “just happens sometimes.”

No one cried. No one talked. Not really. Everyone called it a heart attack. That was all.

But I knew better.

Because I was the one who found him.

It was supposed to be a normal afternoon. A study session for Mr. Crane’s history exam. Jeremiah had the notes; I had the smokes. His dad worked nights at the docks. We’d be alone. Nothing unusual.

The moment I stepped onto the porch, the air felt wrong. Thick, sticky, heavy. The windows were shut tight, curtains drawn. The house sat silent, holding its breath, waiting.

I knocked. No answer.

I opened the door.

The first thing that hit me was the smell.

Rot. Sweet, sickly, cloying. Thick and heavy, like meat left to bake in the sun, left to decay. My stomach turned over. I gagged, pressed my hand to my mouth, tried to choke down the bile.

“Jeremiah! You slaughtering cows up here, or what?” I called, my voice cracking like a child’s.

Silence. Just the low hum of flies somewhere deeper inside.

I forced myself in. Each step on the hallway boards groaned and protested, the sound sharp and echoing. The house smelled of dust, mildew, and something older, fouler, deeper than I could name. I wanted to run back out, but my legs carried me forward, each step dragging me closer to something I didn’t want to see.

The stairs. They groaned with every careful step I took, the wood warped and slick under my shoes. My throat tightened, my chest pulsing, but I had to keep going. One step. Then another. The hallway stretched longer than it should, shadowed, every corner darker than the last. The house seemed to lean in around me, walls breathing, waiting.

Jeremiah’s door loomed ahead. Half-closed. Shadows pooled around its edges. The buzzing grew louder now, a wet, vibrating hum that made my teeth ache.

I reached out, fingers trembling. The knob was cold, slick. My palm pressed against it. I pushed slowly.

The door creaked.

Light from the hallway spilled inside.

And there he was.

Huddled in the corner.

Every detail burned itself into my memory. His skin—dark, shriveled, leathery, stretched thin over brittle bone. His eyes—wide, unblinking, fixed on me. His mouth—unhinged, frozen in a scream that went on forever. One hand clutched his chest as if trying to hold something inside, the other reached toward me, fingers blackened, stiff.

The flies. Thousands of them, crawling over him, buzzing in waves, the sound like static in my skull.

I didn’t move. I couldn’t. I stood in the doorway, stomach twisting, lungs heaving. The air was heavy, warm, scented with the metallic tang of blood, the sickly sweetness of decay. My skin crawled. My mind screamed, but my body refused to obey.

I think I must have screamed, somewhere deep inside. Or maybe I didn’t. Maybe the sound died in my throat. All I remember is running. Down the stairs, through the door, into the fog. My shoes slipping on wet grass, heart hammering, chest heaving.

Everyone called it a heart attack.

I knew better.

I buried it. Deep. Pretended it never happened. Forced it into the dark corners of my memory. Until last night.

The dream. The corridor. The skulls. The faces. Every one of them twisted, reaching, screaming.

And when they shrieked DON’T TRUST THEM, I think… they were warning me. About Blackwood. About all of us.",1,1760132335.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Travelers lug novels the size of bricks through security, swearing they’ll finally finish them between flights and hotel bars. By the end of the trip, the books have done little more than add weight and guilt. The smarter travelers—the ones who’ve evolved beyond literary masochism. Carry an e-reader. The Kindle Paperwhite and its rivals are the best travel hack for anyone who loves words but hates the baggage that comes with them.

It’s not just about convenience. It’s liberation. A Kindle weighs less than a cup of coffee and holds an entire library. Thousands of stories, guides, and guilty pleasures inside a shell thinner than a passport. The glare-free screen reads clean in any light, from a sun-drenched beach in Lisbon to the dim overhead flicker of a budget flight over the Atlantic. The battery lasts weeks, not hours, which feels like sorcery in a world where phones die faster than optimism.

On Amazon, the Kindle Paperwhite sits around USD 150, while the more stripped-down models hover near USD 100. Alternatives like Kobo or PocketBook play in the same price range, each one giving travelers the freedom to carry a bookstore in their jacket pocket. Load it with a few travel memoirs, a local phrasebook, or even something pretentious for late-night train rides. It all fits without the burden of bulk or broken spines.

There’s a quiet dignity in reading while in motion, flipping through digital pages as cities blur past the window. An e-reader doesn’t just save space. It restores an old rhythm to travel. The unhurried pause, the moment of reflection, the story that bridges the distance between places. The best travel hack isn’t flashy or high-tech. It’s the one that brings silence back to the journey. A Kindle doesn’t beep, buzz, or demand attention. It just waits, patiently, for the next chapter.

1o3dr9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1o3dr9p/what_can_i_do_to_help_make_my_25m_partner_feel/,What can I do to help make my 25/M partner feel attractive and improve our sex life?,"Been together 3 years.. both 25 and life together with pets. I won't go into all of the context but life is very stressful.. I have 3 disabilities myself which result in overstimulation and sensory issues - so from the off-set I'm not very into physical intimacy already (sad times).

My partner has also been through sexual trauma that he's opened up to tell me he thinks it's affecting his libido. He cannot sadly afford therapy whereas I am in therapy currently for my issues.

Together, we have gone months without sex but we try and keep emotional intimacy alive, have great communication, regular checkins and do activities together. Not so much dates, but watch movies/shows together, go get a coffee.. go for short walks. There's not much our schedules allow and we're almost always tired and stressed.

Nonetheless, he doesn't cuddle me as much as I like, he doesn't caress me or make any sexy jokes as if he WANTS me. He does do somethings.. he'll kiss me from behind whilst I game.. he'll hug me everyday and lots of forehead kisses. I do the same with him. But even though intimacy was great in the beginning for about a year.. after that, it's almost like life got in the way, I had issues and he got into a spiral about his trauma and we just regressed with sex a little bit.

We're both massively insecure about our bodies. I've worn lingerie before for other men and been rejected brutally so I'm traumatised but I'd love to feel SO wanted that I wouldn't have to worry about that happening again. And that in itself, may help fix my low libido issues too. I think it helps if I have someones vibes to bounce off of. It's almost like sex is so far and few between that we both have become a little awkward with initiating it or not cringing at ourselves with being 'sexy'.

I guess I'm just trying to feel more sexy and I want him to feel more sexy and together, I want a regular and healthy sex life where I look forward to being caressed whilst I cook or touched in nice ways that turn me on. Although we've spoken about things we individually like, it's almost like stress, exhaustion, trauma and life gets in the way. We have both mentioned that we really wanna work on this aspect of our relationships but can't afford couples therapy at the moment.

I guess what I'm asking is... from a guy's point of view, what do you feel from reading this that I can do to support my partner better? He admits he needs therapy from some sexual trauma as this may be involved but he's overall not a confident guy at all and sometimes is so disgusted with how his body looks, he will literally wear a t-shirt in a pool, in bed, etc. I'm one of the only people he's shown his topless body to and it's gorgeous <3 Please be kind - thank you :)",1,1760132070.0,AskMenAdvice,2,0.67,False
1o3dqgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o3dqgd/the_moon_woke_up_i/,The Moon Woke Up ~ I,"When I close my eyes, I still see Earth burning. I see the skyline of Chicago crumbling under its own smoke, the color of blood diluted in rust and ash. The sun hasn’t looked right since the war, and maybe that’s why they picked me—someone who had nothing left worth losing. The year was 2062 when the world finally admitted it was dying. Maybe we all knew before that, but humans are experts at pretending the ground isn’t splitting beneath their feet.

I’m an astronautical engineer by training, but out here, titles are just words that lost their gravity. My name’s Ethan Hale. Forty-three years old. Father of one. Widower, though that word doesn’t mean much anymore when most of the world has been widowed by fire and fallout. My wife, Lydia, was gone long before the war. Cancer. My daughter, Emma—she made it to eight. That was before the air outside our city got so thick with radiation that her little lungs started to shut down. I remember sitting by her bed, the monitors stuttering with each fading breath, her skin pale as moonlight. That was when I decided I’d go if they asked. I’d go anywhere the air was clean. I’d find a world she could have lived on, even if I’d never see it myself.

There are six of us on the *Horizon*. Six remnants of what humanity used to be. We were sent up a year ago—if time still means what it used to. Days blur together when you’re counting oxygen instead of hours. We were supposed to find something—anything—that could sustain life. But most of space is quiet, and quiet is dangerous. You start to hear your own thoughts echo too loud in your skull.

I share a small module with Jensen, our mission pilot. He’s the egotistical one, if you ask anyone who’s been stuck with him longer than a meal cycle. Always talking about how he “could’ve led this mission better” or how “command doesn’t understand real flight dynamics.” He’s brilliant, sure—ace pilot, top of his training class—but he’s the kind of man who can’t stand silence unless it’s filled with his own voice. He shaved his head before we launched, said he didn’t want “stray hairs in zero-g.” I think he just liked seeing his reflection on the metal panels—clean, flawless, untouchable.

Then there’s Varga. Big man. Burn scars up his neck and across half his jaw. He never talks about how he got them, and none of us ask. You can tell it’s something to do with the war, though—he’s got that look in his eyes, like he’s already been to hell and didn’t find it impressive. He handles the maintenance work, the grunt labor, things that make the rest of us flinch. He doesn’t flinch at anything. Once, during a decompression drill, a hatch door slammed shut on his arm. He didn’t make a sound. Just waited until I pried it open and muttered, “Still works.” That was Varga in three words.

Our scientist—Dr. Mei Lin—keeps to herself. The smart one. If there’s anything worth knowing about a planet’s atmosphere, soil, or water, she knows it before the sensors do. Mei’s not unkind, but she’s not built for small talk either. Her voice is calm, even when things go wrong. Especially when they go wrong. I’ve caught her humming sometimes, quietly, when she runs diagnostics. Some old Mandarin tune. It makes the lab feel less like a coffin.

The yapper’s name is Suarez. Youngest of the crew—twenty-six, I think. Talks enough for all of us combined. He used to be a communications officer in the Brazilian navy before the collapse, but he talks like someone who’s never been heard in his life. He keeps asking if I think we’ll ever go home. I never know how to answer him. Not because I don’t want to, but because “home” isn’t really a place anymore.

And then there’s Fischer—the joker. German, or maybe Austrian. He tells jokes that would get him punched back on Earth, if Earth still had bars and beer and laughter to spare. Once told Mei that if we crash-landed, he’d “gladly repopulate humanity” with her. She didn’t even look up from her data pad, just said, “Statistically improbable,” and kept typing. I laughed harder than I should have. You start to crave any sound that isn’t mechanical hum or your own heartbeat.

We left Earth under a sky that looked bruised. The launch was chaotic, improvised. Half our equipment was secondhand military tech, the rest scavenged from old NASA reserves. There was no glory in it. No waving flags. Just a final, desperate reach for something that wasn’t dying. Command didn’t even call it a colonization mission anymore—they called it “Resource Continuity Exploration.” As if finding a rock with breathable air could erase the taste of radiation and guilt.

The first few months were simple enough. We were still pretending this was noble. We’d wake up, check systems, run scans, make coffee that tasted like battery acid. We laughed sometimes. We played cards in zero gravity. Suarez taught us a stupid song from his childhood, and for a few days, it almost felt human again. Then the boredom crept in—the silence, the sameness. When you spend long enough staring into black, the black starts to stare back.

I keep Emma’s photo in my chest pocket. Always. It’s wrinkled, edges curled, the ink faded from the recycled air. Her hair’s in pigtails, her smile gap-toothed, the sky behind her a blue that doesn’t exist anymore. Sometimes, I talk to it. Not out loud. Just in my head. “We’re still looking, kiddo,” I tell her. “We’ll find it.” I don’t say that I’m starting to think there’s nothing out here worth finding.

We’re three days into orbit around a moon that doesn’t appear on any known star chart. No atmosphere, or so we thought. But our sensors have been glitching. Oxygen spikes. Temperature inconsistencies. Mei says it’s impossible. Varga says impossible doesn’t mean shit in space. Jensen thinks it’s a system error. Fischer says maybe it’s ghosts. Suarez just wants to go home.

The moon hung there, a gray coin against a black sea. It wasn’t much to look at—pitted, dry, inert. But I found myself staring anyway. Maybe it was the stillness that drew me in. After a year of constant movement—fans humming, systems cycling, air filters sighing—the idea of something so perfectly motionless felt almost holy.

I sat in the observation module long after the others had drifted to their quarters. The hum of the station was softer here. A few indicator lights pulsed gently, the color of dying embers. I could hear the slow rhythmic pop of the thermal panels adjusting to temperature shifts, metal expanding, contracting. It almost sounded like breathing. I pretended it was Earth, still alive, still trying.

The viewport glass was smudged from fingerprints. Mine, probably. We don’t get new cleaning cloths until resupply, and resupply hasn’t been a word that means anything in months. I stared at my own reflection until it blurred into the cratered surface beyond. The moonlight, faint as it was, carved out the lines on my face, made the gray in my beard look silver. I looked older than forty-three. Out here, we all do.

I used to tell Emma that space wasn’t empty—it was waiting. Waiting for someone brave enough to wake it up. She believed me, back when bedtime stories still meant something. Now, I’m not sure if I was lying to her or to myself.

Behind me, the air recycler clicked off and restarted, a soft mechanical cough that reminded me we were only alive because of moving parts. Everything here hums or whirs or vibrates—tiny reminders that silence means death. Even our sleep is noisy.

I heard footsteps. Jensen again, by the sound of it—he walks like the ship belongs to him.  
“You’re still staring at that rock?” he said. His voice always carries an undertone of amusement, even when he’s dead serious.

“Can’t sleep,” I said without turning.

“Yeah, none of us can. That’s what happens when you circle nothing for too long.” He came closer, hands folded behind his back like some kind of commander in a propaganda film. “You know, Earth Command probably forgot about us months ago. We could be floating here for years and they’d never send retrieval.”

“Wouldn’t make much difference,” I said. “Nothing left to go back to.”

He made a noise somewhere between a laugh and a snort. “Maybe that’s the point. No home to return to means no reason to stop searching. Efficient, if you think about it.”

That was Jensen’s gift—turning despair into logistics.

After he left, I stayed seated. I could still smell his aftershave—synthetic citrus, rationed and bitter. It didn’t cover the scent of recycled air. Nothing does.

Later, Varga came through for his shift check. He nodded to me once, didn’t ask why I was there. He doesn’t ask questions unless they need answers. His hands were wrapped in the same bandages he’s been reusing for months, smudged with grease and disinfectant. He moved like a man whose bones remembered gravity.

“System check?” I asked.

“All green,” he said. His voice was deep, the kind that could fill a hangar without trying. He looked out the viewport for a long time, his reflection cutting against mine. “Ugly thing,” he said finally.

“What, the moon?”

He shrugged. “Everything looks ugly when it’s dead.”

That was the longest conversation we’d had in weeks.

When he left, I pulled the photo from my pocket. Emma’s smile caught the light, the edges of her curls illuminated by a sun that probably doesn’t reach Earth anymore. I traced the curve of her cheek with my thumb, trying to remember what her laughter sounded like without the rasp in her lungs. It’s strange, the things you forget first. You’d think it would be her face, but no. The mind keeps the image. It’s the sound that fades.

Sometimes, I think that’s what the universe is—a giant silence, collecting all the sounds we’ve lost.

Mei Lin joined me just before the next rotation cycle. She moves quietly, like she’s afraid to disturb the air. She handed me a cup of water—real water, not the flavored reconstitution mix we usually ration. “You should rest,” she said.

“Can’t.”

“You’ll burn out.”

“Already did,” I said, but softly enough that I wasn’t sure if she heard.

She sat beside me for a while, not saying anything. Her gaze was fixed on the lunar surface. “There’s something peaceful about it,” she murmured. “Uncomplicated. No politics, no borders. Just rock.”

“Rock’s all we’ve got left,” I said.

She smiled faintly. “Maybe that’s not such a bad thing.”

I wanted to tell her she was wrong—that it was a terrible thing, that peace without life isn’t peace at all. But I didn’t. I just watched the way her reflection lingered against the glass, her face overlapping the moon’s shadowed horizon until it was hard to tell where one ended and the other began.

Hours passed. I don’t know how many. The artificial lighting in the module dimmed automatically to simulate night, but it never feels like night when the stars are always awake. Suarez’s voice echoed faintly through the corridor somewhere behind me, rapid Spanish mixed with laughter. Probably talking to Fischer. Their friendship had turned into a kind of survival mechanism—noise warding off the dark.

I envied them.

The moon didn’t move. Or maybe it did, and I just didn’t notice anymore. It had that kind of gravity—the quiet kind that pulls your thoughts inward until you forget to breathe. Its craters looked deeper the longer I stared, like wells that had swallowed all their light.

I wondered how many men before me had stared at something like that and felt the same thing—the slow erosion of meaning, the gentle ache of knowing you’re both too small and too far gone to matter.

Somewhere deep in the ship, a relay clicked, and the hum of the recyclers dipped for a second. The sudden near-silence startled me more than any alarm could have. Then it resumed, steady as a heartbeat.

Everything was fine. The systems were fine. The crew was fine.

I told myself that a dozen times before I finally stood and turned away from the window.

Before I left, I looked one more time—just one long look at that pale, pitted sphere hanging out there in the void. It looked back the same way it always did. Empty. Still. Unmoved.

But I stayed just long enough to memorize every shadow, every ridge, every faint scar of light. Because when you’ve stared at something long enough, you start to know it like your own face.

1o3dq4r,https://v.redd.it/k9z2mskurcuf1,From one X1C to a full creative studio. Here’s how I turned my side hustle into a living. Thanks to bambu lab.,"I’m Phillipe, creator of KANPAI. A design-focused coffee tools brand I started two years ago as a side hustle with just one Bambu Lab X1 Carbon. That printer alone handled all my prototyping and production initially for the first months. I started with 3D printing in the early days with an anet a1, ender and twotrees... Since I've gotten the X1C I could go all in on just designing and creating stuff without worrying about anything.

Over time, I expanded to seven more P1S printers for production and two A1 Minis for prototyping. I’ve been able to make a living from this setup for a while now. Even as a side hustle. Although I could have easily expanded further, I tried to hold myself back. I didn't feel the need since I’ve learned to manage the fleet efficiently. I just add another one whenever I feel like I can't keep up with the demand. 

Recently, I also added a small studio space to act as a creative hub where I can focus more fully on the brand and product development. I've also changed to part-time on my main job to focus on it. Along with 3D printing, I’ve incorporated CNC machining and laser cutting into my manufacturing process to unlock new design possibilities.

I’m also starting to grow on Instagram to connect more closely with the community, sharing deep dives into 3D printing, CAD design, print farm management, and creative making. I'm kickstarting a new series where I go into the process of creating a product. From sketch to reality. The whole journey with all prototyping, print fails, assembly and so on.

If you’re also working with Bambu Lab machines or building a 3D printing business, I’d love to swap insights. How do you balance scaling, design, and production? Let’s chat!

1o3dn1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterOpening/comments/1o3dn1n/reveal_how_the_kactor_electric_spin_mop_handles/,Reveal How the Kactor Electric Spin Mop Handles Tough Stains,"Testing the KACTOR B0DR662M5C cordless electric spin mop over the past few weeks has been a fascinating experience. As someone who dreads floor cleaning, finding a product that simplifies the process and delivers satisfying results was a breath of fresh air. While undeniably effective, this electric mop has its quirks, which I’ll get into as I break down the features, performance, and value it offers.

**Design that Stands Out**  
The streamlined, lightweight design of this mop immediately caught my attention. At just 5 pounds, it’s a breeze to maneuver around the house. The adjustable tube height is a simple but appreciated feature, allowing users of varying heights to clean comfortably. Plus, the LED-lit mop head isn’t just a gimmick; it genuinely helps illuminate dirt and stains hiding under furniture. I found it particularly useful when tackling spots beneath my couch, where dust seems to magically reappear daily.

**Bright LED Illumination Enhances Cleaning**  
Speaking of the LED headlight, it’s more than a flashy attachment. While using it in my dimly lit living room, I noticed stains I’d have otherwise overlooked. This feature really doesn’t miss a beat in improving how thorough you can be. A neighbor borrowed it to test it on her tiled laundry room, and she was genuinely amazed at how many hidden smudges it revealed. My only critique here is the brightness level, which could be slightly adjustable for more control in different lighting settings. 

[Check KACTOR B0DR662M5C price on Amazon.](https://go.senaar.com/p/b0dr662m5c/)

**Performance That Gets the Job Done**  
Cleaning with this spin mop felt efficient thanks to the dual-motor spinning system. With 160 RPM speed, it’s surprisingly powerful for such a compact tool. Coffee spills, muddy boot tracks, or sticky kitchen stains didn’t stand a chance. I particularly appreciated the self-propelling feature; rather than dragging it around, the mop glides on its own, significantly reducing the effort required. My kids even chimed in to help clean—though they were more fascinated by the spinning than the actual cleaning! That said, it struggled a bit on deeply embedded grout stains, which is something to consider for those with textured tile floors.

**Long-Lasting Battery Life**  
Powered by a 2000 mAh lithium-ion battery, this electric cleaning marvel impressed me with its stamina. I managed to clean the majority of my 1,500 sq. ft. home on a single charge. For larger spaces or obsessive detailers, the 30-to-50-minutes cleaning time per charge should be more than adequate. Charging it back up didn’t take as long as I anticipated either—having it fully juiced felt quick compared to older models I’ve used. However, the lack of a battery level indicator is a small inconvenience, as I had to guess when it needed plugging in.

**Key Benefits**  
- Dual spinning motors make stain removal a breeze  
- LED headlight improves cleaning visibility  
- Self-propulsion reduces physical strain  
- Compatible with various floor types, from tile to hardwood  
- Lightweight and easy to maneuver  

**Negatives to Consider**  
- No battery level indicator for monitoring charge  
- Limited effectiveness on deep grout stains  
- Brightness level of LED could be adjustable  

**Versatility Across Floors**  
One of this mop's biggest assets is its undeniable versatility. Switching between my hardwood floors, kitchen tiles, and the marble surface of my bathroom was seamless. It even tackled sticky syrup stains from breakfast with minimal passes. However, I wouldn’t recommend this mop for thick carpets or textured rugs—despite its power, that’s clearly outside its design scope. My sister, who has two toddlers and a mix of flooring types, swears by how quickly it cleans diverse surfaces in a single session. 

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this product to popular alternatives like the Bissell SpinWave Cordless Mop or Shark Steam Mop revealed some interesting insights. While those products are reasonably robust, I found this spin mop’s 290ml water tank much more accommodating for larger spaces without constant refilling. The self-propelled motion is also something competitors lack in many cases, adding a whole new layer of convenience. That said, the Shark Steam Mop does excel when it comes to deeply sanitizing surfaces, especially against bacteria, since it uses steam rather than typical cleaning solutions. If sterilization is a priority, that might be a preferred option.

**Money's Worth**  
Is this spin mop worth your hard-earned cash? Considering its features, I’d lean towards yes, especially if you’ve been struggling with traditional mops or other labor-intensive cleaning gadgets. The ease it brought to my routine was night and day compared to manual mopping. While it’s not spectacularly innovative, every feature feels deliberate and useful. The lack of an adjustable LED brightness doesn’t undermine its overall value, and for households dealing with multiple floor types, its versatility is a true selling point. Whether you’re a busy professional, a parent juggling chores with playtime, or someone just desperate to make cleaning slightly less awful, it won’t disappoint.

I (31M) need to get this off my chest and maybe get some advice.

The first time I went to a café near me, I immediately noticed a girl working there — she was sweet, young, beautiful, and had such a positive, charming presence with real class that I was immediately drawn to her. I didn’t talk to her that day, just left a tip.

The next time I went there, I gave a small note to her coworker — it was a kind message with my contact info, just in case she wanted to reach out. She never did.

After some time, I started going there regularly to work. I felt like she remembered me from the note because she often smiled at me, and we had this nice eye contact. I always tried to be polite and respectful — thanked her, brought my cup back, just small things.

One day, while I was working, she brought me the coffee I usually order without me asking. She smiled at me, and honestly, my heart jumped. I thought maybe it was a sign to finally take a chance.

So I walked up to her, thanked her for the coffee, and asked if she’d like to go for a walk sometime. She smiled again, but then said she has a boyfriend. That really hurt.

I still think she’s an amazing person — unique, genuine, the kind of girl you don’t meet often. I can’t stop thinking about her. I’m jealous, sad, and I feel kind of worthless because I really wanted to get to know her. Sometimes I think about her boyfriend and how lucky he is to have someone like her — it honestly breaks my heart.

Sometimes I still go to that café to work, but I don’t talk to her anymore. Part of me feels like I should stop going… but another part doesn’t want to let go. I know it’s silly, but I can’t help feeling like I’ll never meet someone like her again.

We’ve had cosmic wars, multiversal crises, and gods falling out of the sky. Cool.
Now give me a handheld mock-doc about what happens between all that.
No CGI armies. No world-ending beams. Just the weird, wonderful people who keep the place running.


🏠 The Premise

After another “minor” super-powered incident leaves multiple agencies short on space, the higher-ups convert an old Avengers outreach facility into temporary housing for displaced support staff, interns, and consultants.

A college media-studies crew gets permission to film a “documentary on the everyday lives of heroes and their coworkers.”
That’s the cover story.

Inside the building, a small group of familiar faces tries to coexist:

The astrophysicist who never met a problem she couldn’t solve with sarcasm and caffeine.

The ex-con storyteller whose retellings of events get more dramatic every time (and somehow include licensed background music).

The rock-bodied alien who thinks every argument should be resolved with group karaoke.

The sorcerer who swears he’s only there to monitor the wards, yet keeps showing up for breakfast.

The hacker who labels every laptop “not magic” while absolutely dabbling in magic.

And one quiet “intern” whose name nobody can remember, but who somehow keeps the dorm running — fixing leaks, patching walls, and occasionally appearing on the ceiling.


Everyone swears the place is haunted by a benevolent ghost.


🎥 The Format

Shot in mockumentary style, a mix of handheld and security-cam footage.
Confessionals. Awkward pauses. Background chaos.

Tone: The Office meets What We Do in the Shadows meets The Marvel Universe.

Every episode follows a small, ridiculous problem that spirals into multiversal nonsense:

The “ghost” alphabetizes the fridge by molecular density.

The sorcerer loses a portal in the laundry room.

The alien hosts a team-building exercise that accidentally summons thunder.

The intern gets blamed for everything and quietly fixes it anyway.


💡 Why It Works

1. Character-driven, not spectacle-driven.  The MCU has plenty of explosions; this gives us personality.

2. Improvisational potential.  Each scene can start with an outline, letting performers find the comedy and heart themselves.

3. Accessible canon.  It could exist between any movies or timelines — a meta safe-zone where continuity doesn’t matter.

4. Cheap, fast, and fun.  One set, minimal effects, maximum humanity.


🧺 Sample Episode Titles

“The Coffee-Pod Conspiracy”

“Laundry Day in the Multiverse”

“The Ghost Does Dishes”

“Intern No More (Probably)”



🕸️ Tagline

“Saving the world was easy.
Living together is the hard part.”

This would be the MCU’s slice-of-life era — a space for humor, small stakes, and character chemistry.
Let them improvise. Let them be awkward. Let them exist between the explosions.

Would you watch it?

1o3dgcr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o3dgcr,Coworth Park Review | Ascot Suite,"Happy Friday! I recently stayed at Coworth Park in Ascot and wanted to share some thoughts, particularly about the newly renovated spa and gym. These facilities just reopened this summer, and since there wasn't much online about the updates when I was researching, I figured this review might help others planning a visit.

Quick background on the property: It's a Dorchester Collection hotel nestled in horse racing territory, and it has something pretty special: its own stables and polo fields. I think it might even be the only UK hotel with polo facilities on-site, though plenty of guests visit for the hotel/restaurant experience rather than the equestrian side.

**TLDR**

It’s \~30 minutes from Heathrow, so it’s a good pit stop after landing and before going to the city. The dining options and renovated wellness space are excellent. For those in/traveling to London, I’d recommend making the journey to eat at Woven. The activities schedule is mainly limited to children’s programming. Which is great for families with young children! The kids club schedule is decently packed with countryside activities, and they’re all included. I wish they had more offerings for adults, like morning yoga or estate tours, since it’s not a city hotel. But not a problem if you prefer doing your own thing.

The hotel’s rooms are split across several places: the main house or Mansion House has 30 rooms and suites, the converted stables has 30 rooms and suites, there are 9 cottage rooms, and two larger cottages you can book out. The Dower House was renovated in 2025 and has three bedrooms. The North Lodge is also has three rooms.

As a blanket statement, it was nice. You will eat well, sleep well, and relax well, but (as someone with no young children or an interest in polo) you might still leave wondering if it’s worth it.

**ROOM**

We stayed in the Ascot Suite, which is actually a junior suite. It’s beautiful (many of the property’s photos online are of this room). I liked how there’s a spacious hallway leading into the room, makes it feel more home-like.

The marble bathroom is gorgeous and the freestanding tub was lovely, which was unexpectedly large for a junior suite.

The room itself is quite modern but maybe slightly bland. I love that the TV is retractable into the console so it doesn’t disturb the flow of the room.

I found the coffee and tea station on top of the minibar a bit narrow, but it works. Because the area of the estate that you wander around in is smaller compared to some other countryside escapes (a lot of the grounds is for polo and horses), I’m glad we got upgraded to this room and I’d definitely recommend choosing a larger room type if you’re staying more than a day.

The bed is absolutely wonderful. I looked it up and it’s from a London-based heritage mattress brand. The mattress topper and protector are from a Bavarian company that washes all the their goose feathers in alps water. I often look to hotels for design/decor/object these toppers are definitely something I want in my home.

**VIBE**

It feels like a fresh, new but definitely hotel-like version of a country estate. It’s not stuffy. The main house is modernized on the inside but still feels somewhat stately. There’s a sitting room connected to another sitting room, where there’s live piano music. We appreciated that the music went well into the evenings, until around 11PM (don’t worry, you can’t hear it if you’re sleeping, soundproofing is good). I definitely wish there were more common areas to rest in in the main house though, which was one of the main misses in this hotel.

The cottages area is definitely more rustic, but again, everything is quite modern/updated.

More so than the house, the interiors of their restaurant Woven are stunning. The lighting, walls, and textiles fit perfectly with their tapestry theme. There’s this one sculptural furniture piece made of paper mache (I could not tell) and I want one.

I also generally loved the art at Coworth Park. Their sculptures are some of my favorite modern sculptures I’ve seen recently. We had fun trying to find them all over the property, and loved how each sculpture lives in harmony with its surroundings. I would even believe the landscaping is designed with the art in mind (see the water fixture on the way to the spa). I think some swans just wander around and they like to chill in the small pool in the evenings by my favorite sculpture.

**SERVICE**

Service ranged from excellent to confusing. No big issues but also not a standout by any means. It’s definitely the reactive rather than proactive type of service. Overall, it’s a well-run place, but not one where people have your room number or how you take your tea or coffee memorized. Everyone was friendly. They took good care of us regarding any requests.

Checkin was smooth and we could go to our room early. We got a quick tour of the main house area before being escorted up. Crucially (half-joking here), we were not offered a welcome drink. (Is that really a big deal? Will I wither into a dehydrated husk without it? No, but many guests will and should expect one at a properly of this level. I feel like this is a missed opportunity to make a standout first impression.)

Where they really shone was the in-room welcome spread. The hotel knew my partner had a birthday a week before our stay and they really delivered on the welcome goods in the room. They customized a helium balloon, which was weighted down so it wouldn’t fly around, with my partner’s name. He was delighted and it was high quality, not one of those cheap ones. Small things like these feel personal, and go a long way even with adults, not just children.

The welcome snack assortment includes champagne, chocolate truffles, lavender shortbread, and a large chocolate-looking dessert thing shaped like a horse in honor of Ascot’s heritage as a polo town. And, a lovely birthday cake that tasted good, not just looked good. I was impressed by their chocolates since they’re not always done well (all different ganaches, all delicious), and the shortbread and cake were both promptly consumed with tea. I forgot to try the horse thing but my partner didn’t know and tossed it since he didn’t like it. I wish I could comment on it- if anyone knows what I’m talking about please do share, otherwise I will forever be wondering what the edible sculpture shaped like a horse’s head is.

There were a few small issues. Our teabags were not refilled after cleaning. This was surprising given how particular the British are about tea. We got skipped for turndown service one night, but I’m not sure if it’s because they simply forgot, or if the light control panel indicated ‘no service.’ So their light control panel has one switch for do not disturb (we did not have this on) and one with the word “maid” - this was flashing orange when we arrived. We left it like that the night no one came. We clicked it the next night and we got turndown. You can see how this might feel confusing, especially as there are no labels indicating what the lights mean. I wish we got an explanation of these switches when we were shown to our room.

Turndown service was pretty basic; it didn’t come with any gifts/treats.

**FOOD**

There are two restaurants here: Woven by Adam Smith, a one Michelin-starred fine dining restaurant, and The Barn, a more casual restaurant set in a (you guessed it) converted former barn (though it doesn’t look like a barn at all now.) Both were excellent, emphasizing local seasonal produce.

Woven is technically a three course menu, but you get so many snacks (and a bread basket with 5 types of bread) that it actually feels more like a 6+ course menu. You can select between 4 appetizers, mains, and deserts, so guests who are staying longer won’t get tired of the same dishes. We didn’t have a single bad dish between us. My favorites from the menu were the scallop starter and the turbot main. Their caviar portions (included in dish) are very generous.

I opted for cheese instead of desert, (I knew I’d try some of my partner’s dessert anyway hehe). The cheese room is beautiful, and you can choose 5 cheeses from a selection. I liked how you get more options but smaller portions, vs larger chunks of less cheese. The 30-month old comte was my favorite (not all comte is created equal and this one reminds me of a delicious aged comte I got from a cheesemonger in Provence.)

We were so full at the end they offered to let us take our petit fours up to our room. They also brought out an extra desert for my partner’s belated birthday with a candle (they also packed it for us), along with a handwritten card from Chef Adam, which was a lovely touch.

The casual restaurant, The Barn (located by the cottages) was excellent too. They serve country classics, and it’s comforting and homey but elevated. The menu changes depending on the season and I tried a new pork dish with apple jam. It was incredible- warm due to the jerk seasoning, succulent, everything I want on a crisp fall evening. All the dishes, highlighting, regional ingredients, were very flavorful and pure-tasting. You can sit outside since there are heaters and blankets. There’s also a log fire in the hearth.

If you don’t want to bother with a restaurant, you can eat in the main house, for an a la carte meal in the sitting rooms. Their menu has casual options. Can’t comment on the food itself but it seems good based on what I saw. They offer afternoon tea too, upon reservation (which you have to do a day in advance).

Breakfast is served at Woven. There’s a buffet of pastries (croissants, pain au chocolat, two different madeleines a day, two different muffins a day), fruit, cheese, yogurts from The Estate Dairy, and homemade compote or preserves. I usually don’t like seeing buffets at a hotel in this price range but everything is high quality and so artfully arranged that I don’t mind. The baker/pastry chef is excellent so kudos to them. I recommend grabbing a muffin of choice for later as they’re quite large for breakfast but sit well at room temp.

However, you can only order one main dish and sides like baked beans are at an extra charge. I thought it was a bit nickel-and-dime-y; many places let you order whatever you want. But even if you stick to one dish, you won’t leave hungry since there’s also the buffet. The blended juice changes each day, highly recommend.

The dishes themselves are executed well. No sad, droopy benedicts here. The eggs in the salmon benedict (I guess it’s technically eggs royale) were perfectly poached, and I usually don’t like hollandaise but I enjoyed this one. The english muffin base was nice and crisp around the edges. I liked the cured trout dish too. The dining is definitely one of the highlights here.

**SPA + GYM**

This is the other highlight. The spa is newly renovated and superb. It’s one of the reasons I visited—I love a good wellness space and wanted to check out what this one is like since there’s next to no info available about the updated facilities online.

The gym is not large, but very nice. The strength equipment is the premium line of techno gym (the gold one), so it automatically tailors itself to your height and your preferred weights if you already have/are willing to download the technogym app. You can easily set it up by scanning the machine’s QR. As someone who sometimes struggles with the machines, I really enjoyed working out here. My partner, who usually works with a PT, also said the equipment challenged him in a good way. Of course, you can use the machines without the app too.

There’s also the body scan machine that assess your BMI, mobility, and more (it takes the strength data from the other machines in the gym if you’ve used them) to create a biological age composite. It’s also from technogym, not inbody, so it was interesting to do this after having done the inbody at a different hotel last month. I’m also going to mention there’s a stairclimber since I like those.

There’s a full length lap pool, sauna, steam room that is always consistently very steamy, unlike many! Theres a snow shower/room too, which seems to be the hot new cold thing in spas.

The treatments are with Wildsmith products. They have their products, other brands, and some niche vitamins for sale in the shop.

There’s a cafe in the spa too, with desserts and quick dishes like soups and sandwiches, but I didn’t try it. (Never in the middle of a massage have I ever thought “you know what, now I really must have a gazpacho”, but to each their own.)

**ACTIVITIES**

Many come for polo. We went during the season but didn’t catch a game.

The kid’s club activities are quite extensive: tennis, archery, beekeeping, falconry, laser clay shooting, hanging out with ponies, duck herding (this sounds so fun?!), clay sculptures, and more. Everything is complementary. There are some activities suitable for the whole family, like “wellbeing class” or watercolor workshops.

You can bike around the estate, play croquet, badminton, or ping pong (we did all of the above). There’s no tours, but you can go horse riding, and we saw children taking lessons. There’s lots of green fields and kids really seem to like frolicking around here. It’s 240 acres, but you can’t access into all of it because some is just for horsies and polo.

We saw lawn chairs placed out in the middle of the lawn and were wondering why, since they aren’t facing anything. But I guess looking at the grass can be quite cathartic as well.

**SMALL THINGS TO NOTE**

The minibar is not complementary. I think at this level, it should be—not necessarily the alcohol, but at least some of the offerings.

If you’re staying for a few days, you may want to go for a larger room (junior suite and up if you can swing it), since there are not too many common areas in the house. And I wish there was chess and board games out in the sitting rooms.

Maybe I’m being too harsh, but when the price is comparable to something like Heckfield Place, I can’t help but compare the two and feel that this one falls short. That said, I genuinely enjoyed my time here. I think I would’ve liked it more if I didn’t immediately go stay there after.

**OVERALL**

The restaurant Woven is worth a trip, and it would be a good idea to stay overnight. I honestly can’t imagine traveling anywhere but upstairs to rest after a meal like that and all the petit fours. And while I know the fat in fattravel isn’t meant to be taken literally, I fear hotels with great F&B offerings will get the better of me. You can book a room, roll into bed after a wonderful meal, have breakfast, and digest it all in the gym and spa or outside the next day.

Would I make the trip for just the hotel itself again? Maybe - it’s 50/50. Higher if they continue to make improvements to the guest experience through guided activities and proactive service. Or if I want to see the sculptures again since I’m someone who will stay somewhere for their art (check out Rosewood Schloss Fuschl if you're into that type of hotel).

I would recommend it for polo enthusiasts and families with one or more small children who want a short countryside escape, and even more so if these children like horses. I would also be curious to check out the renovated Dower House, in a larger group, since it feels very private and cozy.",3,1760131359.0,FATTravel,0,1.0,False

1o3dd3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Viidith22/comments/1o3dd3l/prophetic_pages_part_1/,Prophetic Pages Part 1,"It was a rainy Saturday morning, and I could hear the rain tapping against my window. I looked up from my laptop and let out a soft sigh.

The sound was somewhat annoying, yet also oddly soothing, and I thought it might help me focus on the history essay I needed to finish for school.

As I kept typing away on my laptop, I suddenly heard yelling and shouting. I paused, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, and groaned quietly to myself.

""Not again.""

I got up from my bed and walked out of my room, heading down the hall and downstairs, where the yelling grew louder.

As I turned the corner, I spotted my Mom and older brother Mark in the living room, arguing about something.

""Mom, I already told you I'm sorry! I should have called to let you know I’d be home late. I didn’t realize that party would go on until one in the morning!""

""And I’ve already told you that I don’t like you or your brother being out that late! Something terrible could have happened to you! For heaven's sake, you could have been killed or kidnapped, Marcus!""

Mom and Mark continued their argument, clearly oblivious to my presence. I sighed softly, contemplating whether to just turn around and let them sort it out.

Even though I was twenty-five and Mark was twenty-seven, Mom still treated us like children. She insisted we stay with her until we were both thirty, which infuriated us.

I felt a surge of frustration rising within me, and I cleared my throat as loudly as I could, causing Mom and Mark to stop arguing. They both turned to look at me.

""Oh my goodness, Daniel! I’m so sorry! Did we interrupt your studying?"" Mom asked, sounding genuinely concerned.

""I've been attempting to study for more than an hour, but I can't concentrate with you two bickering like children!""

Mark's face flushed a deep red; I could tell he was embarrassed about the situation, yet he was still angry with Mom and wouldn't cease his argument until he had expressed everything he wanted to say.

""We're sorry, sweetheart. I'm just trying to explain to your brother that staying out late isn't wise,"" Mom said.

I've always disliked that particular trait of Mom's—she's such a worrywart, if that's the right term, because she frets over everything, even the most trivial matters.

""You know what? I'll just head to the library. Maybe I can finish my essay there, and hopefully, there won't be anyone trying to tear each other apart!""

I nearly yelled the last part out of frustration as I turned and stormed back upstairs to my room to grab my things.

As I shoved my laptop and notebook into my bag, I muttered under my breath about the constant fighting and how I felt treated like a child.

Just as I was about to leave, I heard a knock on my bedroom door. I turned to see Mark leaning against the doorframe; I hadn't even noticed him come up behind me.

""Let me guess, Mom sent you up here to stop me from heading to the library,"" I remarked, glancing at him.

""Yep, she believes it's a terrible idea for you to go outside in this rainstorm because you might get sick or even struck by lightning, which is ridiculous, but she wouldn't listen when I told her that.""

I rolled my eyes and plopped down on my bed, slipping on my shoes and ensuring the straps were snug but not so tight that they were cutting into my feet.

""Honestly, I don't care what the worrywart or you think. I'm going to the library to finish my darn history essay without having to listen to another argument from either of you. Now, if you could do me a favor and tell Mom I'll be back before dinner, that would be great,"" I retorted.

Before my brother could respond, I got up, tossed my bag over my shoulder, and pushed past him, making my way downstairs to the main part of the house.

Mom was there, clearly waiting for me. I raised my hand to signal that I didn't want to hear her lecture and assured her I'd be home by dinner before stepping out onto the porch.

The only sounds I could hear were the rain and the rumbling thunder. I let out a soft sigh, double-checking that my bag was securely closed, then pulled up my hoodie and set off toward the city library.

""Who would have thought a library would be open on a weekend?""

After a few minutes of walking along the rain-soaked street, feeling the droplets on my head and back, I found myself in front of the library, a smile creeping onto my face.

The library always brought me joy; there was something magical about the aroma of aged paper and the soft murmurs of books that captivated me.

As I entered the library, I greeted the woman at the front desk. She returned my greeting with a smile, though I could sense she wasn't thrilled to see me looking so drenched.

I located a spot to settle down, and a few minutes later, my belongings were spread out on the desk as I began working on my essay.

In fact, my laptop remained tucked away in my bag while I attempted to proofread my notes before transferring them. I sighed quietly, frustrated that nothing seemed to make sense, and realized I needed some assistance.

I got up and approached the front desk, inquiring if there were any history encyclopedias available that could aid me with my school essay.

She informed me that all the history encyclopedias were located in the back corner of the library and advised me to be cautious while I was there since some of those books were quite ancient.

I nodded in agreement and made my way to the back corner. Upon arrival, I began to sift through the aisles, but all the books appeared either dull or I was certain they wouldn't be of any assistance to me.

Before long, I turned a corner and stumbled upon a section I had never seen before. It looked rather intimidating, as the overhead light was flickering and swaying back and forth.

I noticed a layer of dust on the shelf, and a few bugs scurried out from the shadows, rushing past me. I glanced at all the encyclopedias and couldn't help but smile.

""Perhaps one of these could be useful to me,"" I thought, grinning.

I began to pull encyclopedias off the shelf, examining their covers. Some I had read previously, while others were quite old, likely published when my mom was my age.

As I pushed one encyclopedia aside, something heavy tumbled down onto my foot, causing me to cry out in pain. I quickly slapped a hand over my mouth, not wanting to disrupt the tranquility.

I looked down and saw a thick, brown book lying on the ground. I bent down to pick it up and noticed it lacked any library codes or markings indicating ownership.

However, I soon realized how worn and tattered it was; the spine was cracked. I dusted off the cover and read the title, which sent a shiver down my spine.

""Prophetic Pages""

I opened the book and began flipping through the pages, each one yellowed with age and filled with handwritten notes and strange symbols that seemed to dance before my eyes.

As I continued to flip through the pages, I discovered that each one contained a detailed entry about the life and death of an individual. It struck me that the names were eerily familiar.

They were all people I knew—friends, family, acquaintances. I was in disbelief over what I was holding. When I turned to the next page, I nearly dropped the book on my feet once more.

""Timothy Green - Age 23 - Dies in a car accident on April 15th, 2023""

This page was dedicated to my childhood best friend, Timothy, or Tim, as I called him.

April 15th was tomorrow, and I could feel my heart pounding like a drum in my chest. I closed the book, trying to convince myself that this was just a cruel joke.

I glanced around the library, half-expecting someone to jump out and shout, ""Got you!"" But the aisles were empty. The only sounds were the rain tapping against the nearby window and my heavy breathing.

I came to the realization that I had to hurry home to call Tim and alert him about what was going to happen. I tucked the strange book under my arm and dashed back to the desk where my belongings were.

A few minutes later, I found myself sprinting down the street as fast as a guy who mainly plays video games and practices the trumpet can manage.

I began to ponder a multitude of thoughts: was any of this real? Was the book some sort of cursed object that the library had been concealing?

Upon arriving home, I rushed past Mark and Mom, who were in the kitchen preparing dinner. Thankfully, I didn’t hear them arguing, but I didn’t have the luxury of time to deal with that right now.

Once I reached my room, I tossed my bag and the Prophetic Pages book onto my desk, then grabbed my phone from the nightstand.

Without delay, I dialed Tim's number, my fingers trembling as the phone rang and rang. Just when I thought he wouldn’t pick up, I heard his voice on the other end.

""Dude, you need to listen to me; this is really important. Are you planning to go out tonight?"" I asked him.

Timothy excitedly explained that he was actually going to see a new horror movie that had just been released and suggested I join him if I was done being Mr. History.

I took a deep breath and pleaded with him to stay home, urging him not to drive anywhere and to just remain safe at home. Tim immediately laughed, teasing me about turning into my mother.

I was on the verge of telling him about the peculiar book I discovered at the library, but I knew he wouldn’t believe me. Just then, I heard Mom calling my name, so I told Tim I had to go, and he hung up.

I let out a soft sigh before glancing down at the Prophetic Pages book. Deep down, I feared it might already be too late for my childhood best friend.

I heard Mom calling my name again, so I set my phone back on the nightstand. I then walked out of my room and saw Mom standing at the foot of the stairs.

She informed me that dinner was ready and that she had been calling for me for two minutes, urging me to come downstairs before my food got cold.

At the table, I sat there pushing my peas around my plate with a fork while Mom and Mark were engaged in conversation, but I was focused on them.

My mind was occupied with thoughts of the dangerous book from the library, Tim's disbelief, and the looming possibility of losing my best friend, either tomorrow or maybe even tonight.

""Hey little bro, what's up with you?"" Mark inquired.

I jumped in my seat, nearly falling out, but I managed to keep my composure because I knew if I hit the ground, Mom would treat me like a little baby.

""Oh, I'm just pondering my history essay. I found some intriguing information at the library, and I think it will help me score a good grade,""

I couldn't share the details about the so-called death book because neither of them would believe me, especially since Tim never believed me when I warned him about his fate.

After dinner, I headed back to my room, sat on the bed, grabbed the book, and flipped to the page detailing Tim's death.

I kept staring at it, wondering if it was real or if I could tear the page out and somehow prevent it from happening, like some sort of paradox.

But then I remembered that this book was indeed from the library, and I had borrowed it, yet it lacked any library barcodes or scanning tags, so perhaps it didn't actually belong to the library.

I let out a soft sigh before placing the book on my nightstand, getting ready for bed, and soon I was lying in the dark bedroom, thinking about Tim and the terrible car accident that awaited him on April 15th.

The next morning, as I woke up, sunlight streamed through my window. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and yawned. Instantly, I turned around, glancing at my phone, my thoughts immediately drifting to Tim.

I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. I quickly grabbed my phone and texted Tim, checking if he was alright and if he had enjoyed the movie. I anticipated a swift response, but there was nothing.

Throughout the day, I kept waiting for Tim to either call or text me, but still, no reply came. Panic began to creep in, and I muttered in frustration under my breath.

I made the decision to call Tim's home phone. However, instead of him picking up, it was his mother. When I inquired about Timothy's whereabouts, I heard her gasp in horror.

She informed me that Tim had been involved in a car accident while driving to the grocery store, and the paramedics said he didn’t survive.

In that moment, I felt my legs buckle beneath me. I leaned against the wall, sliding down until I collapsed onto the floor.

The Prophetic Pages had spoken the truth, and it had come to pass. The book had foretold his death, and despite my efforts, I couldn’t save my best friend from dying.

The very next day, I found myself back at the library, enveloped in a fog of sorrow and disbelief, desperate to comprehend what had just transpired.

I settled into the same desk as before, retrieving the book from my bag, gazing at it before I began to leaf through the yellowed pages once more.

Each page contained a meticulous account of the life and death of various individuals; some were familiar to me, while others were not. Yet, each entry represented a friend or family member who would meet their end in unique circumstances, all described in vivid detail.

As I continued to turn the pages, I suddenly halted on one that sent a chill through my hands, almost compelling me to hurl the book across the room.

""Jessica Carter - Age 25 - Dies from an aneurysm on April 16th, 2023""

In that moment, I understood that this page detailed the death of my girlfriend, Jessica.

A shiver coursed through me as I recalled the last time I saw Jessica; we were at the coffee shop, sharing laughter over something silly.

Without hesitation, I jumped up, stuffed the book into my bag, and fished my phone out of my pocket to dial Jessica's number.

""Hey Daniel, what's up? I'm at work right now,"" her voice came through.

""Listen, whatever you're doing, you need to stop or head home. You're in danger!""

I rushed to explain about the book I discovered in the library, detailing how it revealed the deaths of all my friends and family, including her.

I then told her I found Tim's name in the book, and that he died in a car accident yesterday, just as the book predicted for that exact date.

""Whoa, Daniel, I think you've been watching too many horror movies. But when you get to the restaurant, at least bring me that so-called mystical book you have,"" Jessica said before hanging up.

I felt an urge to scream into the emptiness. I urged my feet to run, wishing I had brought my car or something quicker than my clumsy feet. When I finally reached the restaurant, I doubled over, gasping for breath.

As I looked up, I saw a crowd gathered around the entrance, and confusion washed over me. Were they having a sale, or was there a fight going on?

I was indifferent to the commotion; my only focus was finding Jessica to show her the book. I squeezed through the throng and entered the restaurant, where I noticed paramedics and medical personnel, along with an area cordoned off by barriers.

I couldn't see what was happening due to another crowd blocking my view, so I tapped an older man on the shoulder. He turned to me, concern etched on his face.

""Sir, what’s going on?""

""One of the workers just collapsed, and the paramedics think she’s dead,"" he replied.

The moment he mentioned 'she,' my heart plummeted. I pushed through the crowd, and there on the ground, eyes closed and lifeless, lay Jessica.

""No, Jessica!"" I yelled, my voice echoing in the chaos.

Instantly, the paramedics and medical staff turned to me. One approached and asked if I knew her.

I told her I was Jessica's boyfriend, that I had just spoken to her on the phone moments ago, urging her to leave work because it wasn't safe. I was rambling, overwhelmed, and I stopped when the paramedic placed her hands on my shoulders.

""Young man, it’s okay. You should know what happened. Your girlfriend has died from an aneurysm, and there was nothing we could do to save her. I’m so sorry,"" the paramedic said.

The book felt like a dark oracle, revealing its grim secrets, and I thought about showing it to this woman. But if I did, she would likely bombard me with questions I couldn’t answer.

So, I thanked her and, without another word, pushed past everyone and exited the restaurant, furious that this cursed book had claimed yet another person I loved.

Weeks later, the unsettling pattern persisted; each page revealed the demise of a victim who was more familiar to me than Jessica.

I had become a captive of the book, unable to resist the allure of its sinister knowledge. It felt as if it understood my sorrow, with the ink appearing darker on every page.

Then, I stumbled upon a page that shattered my heart into countless fragments upon seeing the name of the individual.

""Marcus Roberts - Age 27 - Died of a heart attack on April 30th 2023""

I realized that was tonight once again, and I leaped out of bed, rushing to brother's room, where I found him lacing up his shoes.

""Dude, where are you going? It's almost nine o'clock at night?""

""Can’t sleep. Thinking about going for a late-night run. Be back soon.""

I pleaded with him not to venture outside tonight, insisting it was too perilous. Mark chuckled, saying I was becoming like Mom, but I was just terrified of losing my brother.

After an hour had passed, I found myself in the kitchen assisting Mom in preparing her renowned double chocolate chip cookies, and I could see that she appeared anxious about something.

I inquired about what was troubling her, and she revealed that Mark had not returned from his walk nor had he sent her a message as he had promised to do when he was on his way back home.

I sensed what was about to unfold, and I knew I had to intervene. I looked at Mom and told her I needed to take care of something urgent, to which she simply nodded in agreement.

Without another word, I quickly put on my jacket and shoes, then dashed out of the house. My breath came in quick, uneven gasps as I sprinted toward the park, Mark's favorite place to walk.

As I neared the park, I spotted a figure lurking in the shadows, and my heart raced in my chest. When I turned the corner, I found him lying on the ground, clutching his chest.

""MARK!"" I yelled.

I hurried to my brother, but deep down, I already knew it was too late for him. That dreadful book had taken yet another victim, and this time, it was my brother.

I was descending into madness; first, my two friends were taken from me, and then my brother. The loss of my loved ones was a heavy burden on my emotions.

That’s when an idea struck me. I seized the book and made my way back to the library one last time, desperate for answers. The main librarian, an elderly woman, looked up at me with her piercing green eyes.

""What is this book? Why is it causing all of this?"" 

I slammed the Prophetic Pages onto the desk. Initially, the lady remained silent, but as she took the book and examined it, her expression shifted, and she regarded me with a serious look.

""Young man, where did you come across this book?"" 

""I was here last time searching for history encyclopedias when this book fell off the shelf and landed on my foot. But you still haven’t answered my question: what is this book?!"" 

""That’s the Prophetic Pages. It has always existed, young man. It chronicles the lives that are intertwined with yours and predicts not only death but also the weight of the choices and paths we take,"" the librarian clarified.

""This isn’t a choice; it’s a curse!"" I shouted in frustration.

""Perhaps it is, or perhaps it isn’t. But understand this: that book only reveals what is already destined. It’s not the cause but a reflection of the choices you’ve made and the connections you’ve established,"" she replied.

I took a step back, my mind racing. Had I somehow cursed all those deaths of my loved ones without realizing it? 

Was I in some way accountable for the choices they made or the paths they chose? 

""Can I change this? Is there any way to stop it?"" I inquired.

""The only way to put an end to this situation is to cut off the connections, but it comes at a cost, young man"".

Her words seemed to penetrate deep within me, and without uttering a single word, I turned away from the desk, leaving my book behind in the library.

I came to the realization that I had to create distance from everyone I cared about. I needed to sever ties with them, even though it felt like a betrayal; it was the only way to protect them all.

In the following weeks, I dedicated my days and nights to solitude. Whenever I encountered someone I recognized, I would steer clear of them, and I ignored their calls and messages.

This was torturous, yet it brought a sense of relief as I observed that no one around me was perishing, and I felt assured that my loved ones were safe.

Then one day, as I went to my bedroom to indulge in some video games, I discovered the Prophetic Pages book lying on my bed, and I felt as if I could melt into a puddle.

I hurried over to it, picked it up, and as I examined the cover, my hands trembled while I opened the book and flipped straight to the last page.

To my surprise, it was entirely blank, leaving me puzzled. Recalling what the librarian had said, I touched the paper and watched in amazement as the information began to materialize before my eyes.

When I saw the name of the next person destined to die, my jaw dropped in disbelief.

Daniel Roberts - 25 years old - Passed away from loneliness on May 15, 2023

The book slipped from my grasp; that date was tomorrow. I couldn't fathom it. I felt as if I might either vomit or weep like a child.

The realization hit me like a massive wave. I had been so focused on saving my friends and loved ones that I had unwittingly sealed my own doom.

I needed to cut myself off entirely from everyone, even my mother, who was thankfully still alive. But I was destined to become a mere ghost.

A mere shadow of who I used to be. This book had twisted my intentions, transforming my wish to protect into a sentence of death.

The following day, I found myself sitting alone on the floor of my bedroom, feeling the darkness creeping in, coiling around me like a serpent.

I reminisced about my friends and brothers, recalling the laughter and memories we had created together. It dawned on me that I had forsaken them all, and in doing so, I had condemned myself.

Mom attempted to coax me out of my room, but nothing she said had any effect. As night descended, I sensed the air becoming thick and oppressive.

Suddenly, I heard whispers—likely from that dreadful book—echoing in my mind, the pages shifting as if they were alive.

I let out a soft sigh, rising to my feet and moving to my nightstand where the Prophetic Pages lay. I began flipping through the book, only to find it completely blank, and I realized I was about to join them.

I shut the book and hurled it to the ground, confronting the horrifying truth: I had become a prisoner of my own decisions, a victim of fate. As the sudden darkness enveloped me, I grasped the meaning of it all.

The real terror did not stem from the foretold deaths but from the isolation I had chosen to accept.

But now it was too late. I had become a new edition of the Prophetic Pages, destined for a solitary conclusion. As I sank into the shadows, I finally understood how to escape the curse of the Prophetic Pages.",1,1760131150.0,Viidith22,0,1.0,False

1o3dcuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ContractorCorner1/comments/1o3dcuh/affordable_plumbing_cheap_or_just_smart/,Affordable Plumbing — Cheap or Just Smart?,"You ever get a plumbing quote that makes you choke on your coffee? Then you find another guy who’s way cheaper… and you think, “too good to be true.” Sometimes it is. Sometimes it’s not.

I came across this write-up about *affordable plumbing services*. Not the usual ad stuff. Just real talk. It said—cheap doesn’t mean trash work. It means smart work. Planning. Efficiency. Doing it right the first time so you’re not calling again next month.

Made sense.  
A pro who knows what they’re doing won’t waste time or parts. That’s where savings come from. Not from cutting corners.

They even mentioned PEX pipes. Kinda underrated. Way cheaper than copper, but still tough as hell. Most folks don’t realize that’s how some plumbers keep prices low *without* going sketchy.

Also—preventive stuff. That part hit me.  
Do small maintenance now, save big later. Because waiting for a leak? That’s pain. And a fat bill.

The line that stuck with me:

“Affordable doesn’t mean cheap. It means honest.”

So true.

Anyway, curious what others think—  
Would you hire a plumber who charges less but uses different materials?  
Or do you stick with the big names just to feel safe?",1,1760131134.0,ContractorCorner1,0,1.0,False

Short story; ETS'ng in a few months, term leave approved for mid Dec, packet is in and NG life/grad school await. Trying to figure out if I can book hhg move without orders (or even authorize diy).

  
ETS packet got sent in a while ago (confirmed with the office), but no orders cut before the shutdown. And while the travel ppm office is open, they say they can't start any processes without ets orders uploaded. Further, my understanding is if I cover the expenses myself the DoD won't compensate me later on.

  
So between closing on a house, getting kids in new schools, wife starting her job in the new area, etc etc. All of it adds up where I start eating thousands of dollars either way. So I'm in a rock/hard place, as the window to get things scheduled is closing.

  
The online dps system has a \* note that the ppm office can authorize shipments without orders, but not finding any info on that process.  Any input from a SME, or people who've found options here?



Just a large black coffee for me, thanks. I'm living off caffeine and frustration right now.

1o3d882,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o3d882,Coworth Park Ascot Review: countryside estate 30m from London Heathrow,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my review of Coworth Park in Ascot from my stay last month. For those unfamiliar, it's located in the heart of horse racing country and has recently completed renovations on its spa and gym facilities, reopening them in summer 2025. Since I couldn't find much information about the updated amenities before my visit, I thought I'd share my experience to help anyone considering a stay.

Fun fact: Coworth Park (part of the Dorchester Collection) is the only (or one of the only?) hotel in the UK with its own polo fields and stables.

**TLDR**

It’s around half an hour from Heathrow, so it’s a good pit stop after landing and before going to the city. The dining options and renovated wellness space are excellent. For those in/traveling to London, I’d recommend making the journey to eat at Woven. The activities schedule is mainly limited to children’s programming. Which is great for families with young children! The kids club schedule is decently packed with countryside activities, and they’re all included. I wish they had more offerings for adults, like morning yoga or estate tours, since it’s not a city hotel. But not a problem if you prefer doing your own thing.

The hotel’s rooms are split across several places: the main house or Mansion House has 30 rooms and suites, the converted stables has 30 rooms and suites, there are 9 cottage rooms, and two larger cottages you can book out. The Dower House was renovated in 2025 and has three bedrooms. The North Lodge is also has three rooms.

As a blanket statement, it was nice. You will eat well, sleep well, and relax well, but (as someone with no young children or an interest in polo) you might still leave wondering if it’s worth it.

**ROOM**

We stayed in the Ascot Suite, which is actually a junior suite. It’s beautiful (many of the property’s photos online are of this room). I liked how there’s a spacious hallway leading into the room, makes it feel more home-like.

The marble bathroom is gorgeous and the freestanding tub was lovely, which was unexpectedly large for a junior suite.

The room itself is quite modern but maybe slightly bland. I love that the TV is retractable into the console so it doesn’t disturb the flow of the room.

I found the coffee and tea station on top of the minibar a bit narrow, but it works. Because the area of the estate that you wander around in is smaller compared to some other countryside escapes (a lot of the grounds is for polo and horses), I’m glad we got upgraded to this room and I’d definitely recommend choosing a larger room type if you’re staying more than a day.

The bed is absolutely wonderful. I looked it up and it’s from a London-based heritage mattress brand. The mattress topper and protector are from a Bavarian company that washes all the their goose feathers in alps water. I often look to hotels for design/decor/object these toppers are definitely something I want in my home.

**VIBE**

It feels like a fresh, new but definitely hotel-like version of a country estate. It’s not stuffy. The main house is modernized on the inside but still feels somewhat stately. There’s a sitting room connected to another sitting room, where there’s live piano music. We appreciated that the music went well into the evenings, until around 11PM (don’t worry, you can’t hear it if you’re sleeping, soundproofing is good). I definitely wish there were more common areas to rest in in the main house though, which was one of the main misses in this hotel.

The cottages area is definitely more rustic, but again, everything is quite modern/updated.

More so than the house, the interiors of their restaurant Woven are stunning. The lighting, walls, and textiles fit perfectly with their tapestry theme. There’s this one sculptural furniture piece made of paper mache (I could not tell) and I want one.

I also generally loved the art at Coworth Park. Their sculptures are some of my favorite modern sculptures I’ve seen recently. We had fun trying to find them all over the property, and loved how each sculpture lives in harmony with its surroundings. I would even believe the landscaping is designed with the art in mind (see the water fixture on the way to the spa). I think some swans just wander around and they like to chill in the small pool in the evenings by my favorite sculpture.

**SERVICE**

Service ranged from excellent to confusing. No big issues but also not a standout by any means. It’s definitely the reactive rather than proactive type of service. Overall, it’s a well-run place, but not one where people have your room number or how you take your tea or coffee memorized. Everyone was friendly. They took good care of us regarding any requests.

Checkin was smooth and we could go to our room early. We got a quick tour of the main house area before being escorted up. Crucially (half-joking here), we were not offered a welcome drink. (Is that really a big deal? Will I wither into a dehydrated husk without it? No, but many guests will and should expect one at a properly of this level. I feel like this is a missed opportunity to make a standout first impression.)

Where they really shone was the in-room welcome spread. The hotel knew my partner had a birthday a week before our stay and they really delivered on the welcome goods in the room. They customized a helium balloon, which was weighted down so it wouldn’t fly around, with my partner’s name. He was delighted and it was high quality, not one of those cheap ones. Small things like these feel personal, and go a long way even with adults, not just children.

The welcome snack assortment includes champagne, chocolate truffles, lavender shortbread, and a large chocolate-looking dessert thing shaped like a horse in honor of Ascot’s heritage as a polo town. And, a lovely birthday cake that tasted good, not just looked good. I was impressed by their chocolates since they’re not always done well (all different ganaches, all delicious), and the shortbread and cake were both promptly consumed with tea. I forgot to try the horse thing but my partner didn’t know and tossed it since he didn’t like it. I wish I could comment on it- if anyone knows what I’m talking about please do share, otherwise I will forever be wondering what the edible sculpture shaped like a horse’s head is.

There were a few small issues. Our teabags were not refilled after cleaning. This was surprising given how particular the British are about tea. We got skipped for turndown service one night, but I’m not sure if it’s because they simply forgot, or if the light control panel indicated ‘no service.’ So their light control panel has one switch for do not disturb (we did not have this on) and one with the word “maid” - this was flashing orange when we arrived. We left it like that the night no one came. We clicked it the next night and we got turndown. You can see how this might feel confusing, especially as there are no labels indicating what the lights mean. I wish we got an explanation of these switches when we were shown to our room.

Turndown service was pretty basic; it didn’t come with any gifts/treats.

**FOOD**

There are two restaurants here: Woven by Adam Smith, a one Michelin-starred fine dining restaurant, and The Barn, a more casual restaurant set in a (you guessed it) converted former barn (though it doesn’t look like a barn at all now.) Both were excellent, emphasizing local seasonal produce.

Woven is technically a three course menu, but you get so many snacks (and a bread basket with 5 types of bread) that it actually feels more like a 6+ course menu. You can select between 4 appetizers, mains, and deserts, so guests who are staying longer won’t get tired of the same dishes. We didn’t have a single bad dish between us. My favorites from the menu were the scallop starter and the turbot main. Their caviar portions (included in dish) are very generous.

I opted for cheese instead of desert, (I knew I’d try some of my partner’s dessert anyway hehe). The cheese room is beautiful, and you can choose 5 cheeses from a selection. I liked how you get more options but smaller portions, vs larger chunks of less cheese. The 30-month old comte was my favorite (not all comte is created equal and this one reminds me of a delicious aged comte I got from a cheesemonger in Provence.)

We were so full at the end they offered to let us take our petit fours up to our room. They also brought out an extra desert for my partner’s belated birthday with a candle (they also packed it for us), along with a handwritten card from Chef Adam, which was a lovely touch.

The casual restaurant, The Barn (located by the cottages) was excellent too. They serve country classics, and it’s comforting and homey but elevated. The menu changes depending on the season and I tried a new pork dish with apple jam. It was incredible- warm due to the jerk seasoning, succulent, everything I want on a crisp fall evening. All the dishes, highlighting, regional ingredients, were very flavorful and pure-tasting. You can sit outside since there are heaters and blankets. There’s also a log fire in the hearth.

If you don’t want to bother with a restaurant, you can eat in the main house, for an a la carte meal in the sitting rooms. Their menu has casual options. Can’t comment on the food itself but it seems good based on what I saw. They offer afternoon tea too, upon reservation (which you have to do a day in advance).

Breakfast is served at Woven. There’s a buffet of pastries (croissants, pain au chocolat, two different madeleines a day, two different muffins a day), fruit, cheese, yogurts from The Estate Dairy, and homemade compote or preserves. I usually don’t like seeing buffets at a hotel in this price range but everything is high quality and so artfully arranged that I don’t mind. The baker/pastry chef is excellent so kudos to them. I recommend grabbing a muffin of choice for later as they’re quite large for breakfast but sit well at room temp.

However, you can only order one main dish and sides like baked beans are at an extra charge. I thought it was a bit nickel-and-dime-y; many places let you order whatever you want. But even if you stick to one dish, you won’t leave hungry since there’s also the buffet. The blended juice changes each day, highly recommend.

The dishes themselves are executed well. No sad, droopy benedicts here. The eggs in the salmon benedict (I guess it’s technically eggs royale) were perfectly poached, and I usually don’t like hollandaise but I enjoyed this one. The english muffin base was nice and crisp around the edges. I liked the cured trout dish too. The dining is definitely one of the highlights here.

**SPA + GYM**

This is the other highlight. The spa is newly renovated and superb. It’s one of the reasons I visited—I love a good wellness space and wanted to check out what this one is like since there’s next to no info available about the updated facilities online.

The gym is not large, but very nice. The strength equipment is the premium line of techno gym (the gold one), so it automatically tailors itself to your height and your preferred weights if you already have/are willing to download the technogym app. You can easily set it up by scanning the machine’s QR. As someone who sometimes struggles with the machines, I really enjoyed working out here. My partner, who usually works with a PT, also said the equipment challenged him in a good way. Of course, you can use the machines without the app too.

There’s also the body scan machine that assess your BMI, mobility, and more (it takes the strength data from the other machines in the gym if you’ve used them) to create a biological age composite. It’s also from technogym, not inbody, so it was interesting to do this after having done the inbody at a different hotel last month. I’m also going to mention there’s a stairclimber since I like those.

There’s a full length lap pool, sauna, steam room that is always consistently very steamy, unlike many! Theres a snow shower/room too, which seems to be the hot new cold thing in spas.

The treatments are with Wildsmith products. They have their products, other brands, and some niche vitamins for sale in the shop.

There’s a cafe in the spa too, with desserts and quick dishes like soups and sandwiches, but I didn’t try it. (Never in the middle of a massage have I ever thought “you know what, now I really must have a gazpacho”, but to each their own.)

**ACTIVITIES**

Many come for polo. We went during the season but didn’t catch a game.

The kid’s club activities are quite extensive: tennis, archery, beekeeping, falconry, laser clay shooting, hanging out with ponies, duck herding (this sounds so fun?!), clay sculptures, and more. Everything is complementary. There are some activities suitable for the whole family, like “wellbeing class” or watercolor workshops.

You can bike around the estate, play croquet, badminton, or ping pong (we did all of the above). There’s no tours, but you can go horse riding, and we saw children taking lessons. There’s lots of green fields and kids really seem to like frolicking around here. It’s 240 acres, but you can’t access into all of it because some is just for horsies and polo.

We saw lawn chairs placed out in the middle of the lawn and were wondering why, since they aren’t facing anything. But I guess looking at the grass can be quite cathartic as well.

**SMALL THINGS TO NOTE**

The minibar is not complementary. I think at this level, it should be—not necessarily the alcohol, but at least some of the offerings.

If you’re staying for a few days, you may want to go for a larger room (junior suite and up if you can swing it), since there are not too many common areas in the house. And I wish there was chess and board games out in the sitting rooms.

Maybe I’m being too harsh, but when the price is comparable to something like Heckfield Place, I can’t help but compare the two and feel that this one falls short. That said, I genuinely enjoyed my time here. I think I would’ve liked it more if I didn’t immediately go stay there after.

**OVERALL**

The restaurant Woven is worth a trip, and it would be a good idea to stay overnight. I honestly can’t imagine traveling anywhere but upstairs to rest after a meal like that and all the petit fours. And while I know the chubby in chubbytravel isn’t meant to be taken literally, I fear hotels with great F&B offerings will get the better of me. You can book the lowest room tier, roll into bed after a wonderful meal, have breakfast, and digest it all in the gym and spa or outside the next day.

Would I make the trip for just the hotel itself again? It’s 50/50. Higher if they continue to make improvements to the guest experience. Or if I want to see the sculptures again since I’m someone who will stay somewhere for their art (looking at you, Rosewood Schloss Fuschl).

I WOULD recommend it for families with one or more small children who want a short countryside escape, and even more so if these children and you like horses or polo. I would also be curious to check out the renovated Dower House, in a larger group, since it feels very private and cozy.",15,1760130832.0,chubbytravel,3,1.0,False
1o3d860,https://i.redd.it/z1at0ytkocuf1.png,"Idea validation: A fully local, privacy-first (no servers, no data collection) & customizable email client — would you use it?","I’ve been hacking away on a side project called [YouniqMail](https://youniqmail.com/): It is basically an email client for people who care about real privacy and want full control over how they handle email.

The core concepts:

* It stores **everything locally**. No cloud, no sync, no “trust us” server. It only communicates with the mail servers
* **I literally don’t run a backend** — your emails never touch anything I own.
* It’s **super customizable** (not now, but will be coming soon while alpha phase) — you can tweak workflows, layout, and email management to fit how you work.
* Has a **flag system (like Apple Mail) and a tag system, and I’m planning to add labels later**. To organize your mails even better with multiple systems.
* Maybe also the functionality to add notes for mails.
* The goal is to make email feel like a toolbox, not a black box. The slogan is ""Email management that adapts to you – not the other way around."". So that your are not forced to do ""inbox zero"" or some other email workflows you don't want. **I firmly believe that every user has different workflows for their email management. That's why the approach with the ""highly customizable"".**
* ...of course many more features or characteristics but don't want to list them all here 😅

I built it because I got tired of email clients being either privacy nightmares because they are stored or some features only work with the servers of the developers, or completely rigid.

I’d love your honest thoughts:

* Would you ever switch to a fully local email client like this?
* How much do you care about privacy (and perhaps a compromise on some features) vs. convenience?
* How important is **customization** vs. simplicity for you?
* How do you use and organize your emails and workflow?
* What would make a email client like this worth paying for or switching to?

I’m just trying to see if this scratches an itch beyond my own. I'm going to program it for my own use anyway, but I'd be interested to know if it would be of interest to other people. If so, I'd start an alpha phase soon. Appreciate any feedback 🙏",1,1760130828.0,MVPLaunch,1,0.67,False

Good to very-good location for a cafe, I think.  At the entrance to a high income residential area ($1MM houses etc) in a walking neighborhood, good foot traffic on high visibility street, right between that resid area and a popular restaurant-bar-salons street.  Will be the closest coffee shop to that residential area and one of only two coffee shops on the restaurant-bar-salon street after the Starbucks closes (it’s on the closure list) - the other one is at the far end of that street but always very busy.

For the office, location isn’t a big deal.  It has one offstreet parking spot for my (very infrequent) client visits, and is a three block walk from my house :-) I don’t need all the space, so I’ll rent a room to a close friend for his little office.

Building is a 1908 house converted to triplex, which I’ll convert to commercial.  Cafe on ground floor with wrap-around porch.  My business’ office on second floor.  Also a basement and attic that we’ve no clear plans for yet.  Have been all over this building with architect and inspectors, met with city, know what we’ll need to do for conversion.  Assuming one key issue that hopefully goes in our favor, it’ll basically be a wheelchair lift and ADA bathroom, and a small coffeeshop-type commercial kitchen, plus coffee counter, opening up some (non-bearing) walls, and cosmetics.  If the issue isn’t decided favorably, I’ll be sad as that will mean fire sprinklers and a second floor egress.  But I think we’ll win it.  We are also going to design the menu to avoid needing a hood . . . but will put in all the electrical, plumbing, surfaces for a future hood and full-blown restaurant-type commercial kitchen just in case.

Basically we’ll launch as a coffee shop and bring in the cafe part (i.e. more food) over time.  

Oh, and books.  It will be a cafe-bookstore.  Curated used books.  I’m not sure the book part will amount to more than ambience, but if it takes off then we’ll expand to the basement.  

My daughter will own and run the coffee shop, she has a strong food service background but not much coffee experience, so she’ll be working at friends’ coffee shops during the 5 to 9 months of building conversion work.  As mentioned, my office will be upstairs and I and the rest of the family will help out in the beginning.  A bunch of her friends, also food service folks, have volunteered to help out during her initial months.  By then hopefully she’ll have the kinks worked out, a good barista on board, and be ready to ramp up the cafe food part.  

The real estate aspect is basically an owner occupied commercial building, seller financed over 10 years.  My Property LLC will rent to my business LLC and my daughter’s cafe LLC.  If her cafe doesn’t work out, I’ll rent that space to someone else for a cafe/small restaurant.  There is strong demand for such space in this immediate area, maybe one vacancy every year or two, they get snapped up before ever hitting listings.  

Anyway, after seven months working on the building acquisition, it’s time to start this adventure.  Looking forward to getting the keys, changing the locks, and starting the demo!

I’ve posted in various subs and gotten a lot of help - r/realestateinvesting and r/tax helped with thinking through the property purchase and structure aspect, r/restaurantowners helped with thinking through the kitchen and food part, r/buildingcodes and r/firesprinklers were very helpful too, and r/coffeeshopowners was, of course, invaluable.

PREP FOR SURGERY 
I didn’t drink alcohol for over a month. No weed. No nicotine for over month either. Low caffeine. Drank sooo much water. I eat very healthy n organic n exercise regularly too. I’m a fairly healthy person. Female 23yo 125lbs. 
For food I got(all organic, no dairy, no spice) unsweetened applesauce, baby puff snacks, protein shakes non dairy, non dairy yogurts, eggs, tuna packets, apple juice, suckers, noodles, and honey. To start 
I ordered an ice cube tray for little ice 
Just to mention my tonsils are insanely huge. Just ugly ginormous balls in the back of my throat 

SURGERY TIPS 
Water. Idgaf how bad it hurts. Get water down. They said if I don’t get any food in it’s fine bc the body will figure that out as long as you have enough water in you 
Take care of yourself long before surgery. If you go in with a shit first and shit body, you’re gonna have a shit outcome 
Get a support system together as best you can to come check on you and cook or clean whatever find you closest in network ER in case of any complications 
Honestly just get your whole house in order the best you can, cleaned, laundry done, have comfy clothes picked out, have food ready and prepped, get your liquid ibuprofen and liquid Tylenol before the surgery (I did not n hated going to Walmart drowsy-mom drove-)
And apparently plan to spend a month off work but still pay ur bills lol I’m fine, but I can understand how that would be hard for some


DAY OF SURGERY 
Surgery is extremely anxiety provoking for me. I don’t like not being in control. That said I cried from the moment I stepped into the hospital(8am) until they gave me the funny drug before knocking me out. Every other surgery, it has felt like my eyes shut n I blink n I’m back up. This when felt like I actually stayed asleep n woke up from a nap. Not a bad thing. 
They said my surgery was the most smooth tonsillectomy they had ever seen and expect my recovery to be the same way. So fingers crossed for that. Definitely helped my spirits a little. 
Upon waking up I felt fine. Throat was fine but obviously had smthn done to it. I could take. I drank apple juice and ate apple sauce n half a cup of ice chips. In about 20 minutes I was up, dressed, peed, and ready to leave. I still felt groggy but I was fine. In the car I noticed they busted tf out of my lip. Like it’s red swollen looks like I got punched n the sides of my lips where they fold are very raw n bad. Not painful just damn 
Once I got home I ate a scrambled egg bc I wanted smthn in my stomach with protein before the numbing wore off. So egg and some water. Then I took a nap. Woke up and ate some off those melting baby puffs-strawberry banana I SWEAR by these. They instantly melt down n are easy to swallow. Get them. no they’re not acidic. Plus they have a bit of vitamins in them which will help everything. I also ordered a mini square ice cube tray off Amazon. So I had a few ice chips with my girl dinner. After waking up from the nap I can feel the numbing wearing off. This would be 4 hours after surgery n my uvula is just insanneeeee swollen in size lol. Pain so far is about a 2/10. Resting is fine. When I swallow it’s a little rough but not crazy. Talking doesn’t hurt it just takes a lot of effort so I’m trying to keep it to a minimum. I don’t want to baby myself too much bc it seemed like the girlies that did that ended up worse. I’m looking for the happy medium between rugged and princess. I ate a lot today. Total 3 eggs, sorbet, puffs, applesauce, 2apple juice, lots of water. 

DAY 2
No real pain again. Just discomfort when talking and swallowing. I don’t have a lot of energy but enough to mosey around. 
Oatmeal for breakfast and apple juice. Lots of water yet. 
I was hoping for more of an update but I ate an egg and some baby potatoes with a ranch tuna packet. Had some decaf coffee. I have virtually no pain. Just very uncomfortable feeling in my throat and I can’t talk loudly. 
Eating fresh cookies and ice cream now 
Overall recovery is going flawlessly. I hope to be one of the lucky ones but everyone thinks that until day 5/6 comes around. But we will see! I am hopeful 

DAY 3
 My throat is a little swollen but besides that same as the last two days. No pain. Just discomfort. Talking is a little more rough bc the swelling pushed my jaw forward so I have a lisp lol. I haven’t mentioned this yet but I take Tylenol every 4 hours and ibuprofen every 4 hours but staggered so I’m taking one every 2 hours n I really think that’s why I’m doing so well. That n how in depth I prepped for this ahead of time. 
Ate 2 eggs this morning n some half caf coffee. Going to attempt to eat pancakes for lunch. Ate chicken for supper n mushy vegetables 
Today was good. No but change. I can tell I’m swelling a bit tho. I did go for a walk today. 30 min slow walk. Felt good to move 

DAY 4
I missed my 8am dose. That set me back by like 5%. So nothing crazy but I could tell. I would say I have pain today. But just a 1/10. All on the left side n it’s between my ear and tonsil hole which the dr said would happen. It’s not bad but it’s there. The scabs are officially huge now white. Not excited for them to fall off lol. I ate 2 eggs n some pancakes for breakfast. Gonna get ice cream later. 
I’m a little more swollen that yesterday in my throat. It feels like pressure mostly. One of the scabs has some red spots in it which concerns me so I’m gonna Reddit dive. No blood in my spit or anything tho 
I’m noticeably more tired today than the other days but I’m gonna chalk that up to not eating enough. Like I’m trying my best but really I’m not eating enough regardless. Had potatoes n tuna for supper 
I sat outside a lot today which may have been not the best idea in the works bc it was super hot but i definitely also drank so much water so I think it was fine 

DAY 5
When I woke up today I had a bit of real pain 3/10. Just all over in my throat after doing my morning routine tho it went away. Just more discomfort again. Still slight pain in my ear. Ate eggs n sausage for breakfast. Cookie n coffee later in the day. 
I definitely had some intermittent pain throughout the day. Nothing crazy. 3/10 at most. N it was more just irritating pain than PAIN pain yk. Ate more eggs and sorbet and noodles for supper. 
My ice cold water is starting to b painful. N my tongue is starting to hurt which is weird but I’m assuming is the referred pain. I have a feeling tmrw might b rough. 
When I look in my throat, yea I see the scabs but they don’t look to be falling off which is supposed to b the start of the pain, and there’s some dark blood spots in them. U can see in the pictures. I only found 2 other posts that mentioned them n neither of them had said if it was fine or not. I’m assuming it was tho lol idk. But today was the roughest so far but not even rough. Tmrw I’m gonna get (decaf) coffee n then read my books the rest of the day. Not that I did a lot today but yea 
I’m starting to get nervous for the possible hemorrhage when they fall off bc dr said it’s days 5-9 most commonly. But again my entire recovery has been sooooo smooth. Oh I notice I get a little extra swollen if I talk a lot 

DAY 6
Last night I woke up at 4am for medicine n I was in pain. Probably the worst pain so far 4.5/10 but I fell back asleep after n when I woke at 6am it was gone. Weird little burst. N again I’m only taking Tylenol n ibuprofen staggered n the children’s dose of it. But again just discomfort. It’s harder to swallow today. Talking is the same. Gonna get coffee n food soon. I’m impatiently waiting for these scabs to fall off so I can be done healing. Scabs has a little pink hue to them today 

DAY 7
Alright. I feel the pain today. I’m also just in a super oissy mood which is probably worsening it. I’d say 4.5-5/10 it’s not unbearable but it’s always there which hasn’t been the case the rest of the time n I’m not a fan. 
Ate an omelet for breakfast n it was harder to swallow today bc it did hurt a little but not terrible just had to like move my head in a direction that helped swallow lol n I had some half caf coffee. 
As always drinking a lot of water n keeping up on my meds. Everyone said that by day 9 ur pretty much done with pain. So. Just 2 more days!! My scabs r looking more pink even than yesterday which I’m taking as a sign of healing. They don’t look bloody just like they’re turning  to tissue. Ik that’s not how it works but idk how else to describe it. Regardless. No issue so far
Had ham n potatoes for supper
By the end of the day my pain had subsided 

DAY 8
Essentially no pain. Swallowing still weird. 
Scabs r pinkish still. They don’t look it in pictures but they are. If tmrw goes well I’m going to assume I’m over the hill! 
Egg for breakfast. N I’m going to start taking the Tylenol n ibuprofen a every 6 hours now instead of 4 

DAY 9
No pain today. Swallowing n talking r a little easier. Just a little tho. I think we’re on the up n out 
I keep forgetting to take my meds n I still have no pain so that’s cool. This whole thing has been so much easier than I thought it would be 
Smthn I forgot to mention is foood constantly gets stuck in the scabs pockets. I don’t irrigate it like wisdom teeth removal I just drink water n lightly swish around my throat to get it out 

DAY 10-1 (dash for restarting)
Ofc I jinxed myself. Woke up at 3:45am and had a weird taste in my mouth. I drank a little water but weird taste stayed n I remember thinking ‘am I fucking bleeding. On day 10’ sure enough go to the bathroom n it’s not a lot but I am bleeding so I do the ice water swishing but I kept accidentally swallowing like it’s was just the reflex. N it wasn’t getting worse or better but I know I’m 15 min from the er. So I just told my bf he’s taking me. So we get there n check in. It’s still steadily bleeding no worse or better. N the. It’s takes me back n said it won’t clot if I’m watering it down. She was right which was weird. Once I stopped that it almost instantly clotted. Took about 3 min. But the clot was hanging down my throat n making me gag so much it was horrible. I threw up baseball size blood clots it was nasty. But it would randomly stop bleeding n then just GUSH blood n they said there’s nothing they can do til the ent doc gets there to cauterize it. They fully put me under n intubated me n recauterized the area. The entire staff was so nice which I’m grateful for. N they pumped the blood out of my stomach which is cool bc that made me nauseous while I was waiting for surgery. It wasn’t like as scary as I thought it was gonna be. Once I got to the hospital I calmed down bc then like I’m already there yk but when ur bleeding in the way to its just scary. They had me breathe this mist stuff in that was supposed to constrict the vessels to stop the bleeding. Ummm idk I bled worse after that lol so idk. Either way. Second surgery went fine. Today is Thursday 9am rn. N I’m supposed to go back to work Monday. I messaged my boss n explained the situation n said I’m gonna call my original surgeon and ask him if it’s still safe for me to return or if I should have more time off, which I don’t want. I’m losing my mind having so much free time I’m very much a person that needs to work. I need the regulation ha. But I’m a welder n it’s 90 degrees all next week. The job is very physically demanding. That’s why I want the okay bc I’m not risking my life for a job. Will update later 
The rest of the day was slow n I cried a lot. That was so traumatic. Gawd I hope no one goes through that but I know it’s common. It’s definitely way more common than 3%. Look at all these stories on here. 

DAY 11-2
The way the dr cauterized it makes it look real weird I don’t like it but it’s completely scabbed over so that’s cool. The right side (good side) is still some white yet but it’s pretty healed. I stg if that side bleeds I’ll cry. Once I’m past day 14 for that side I’ll call it a win but some people hemorrhage superrr late. 
Anyway, I am so insanely drained today. I’ve been asleep more than I’ve been awake n I’m just soooo drained. I ate 2 eggs. 2 pancakes. 1.5 eggrolls. A cookie n a hotdog today. Obviously by now u can see I am not skipping meals lol n I drink at least half a gallon of water each day 
But damn I was not ready to be this drained but I’m assuming the insane blood loss and 2 surgeries in a week will do that huh. 
I’m still dealing with how traumatic that was. Having blood pour out of me like that n the clots n the gagging n the taste. Everything is triggering me. I haven’t really had anything like that happen. Idk. One day at a time huh 

DAY 12-3
Not a lot of pain today. I only took Tylenol twice. Right side is healing fine still. Left side still looks fucked but whatever. I’ve been a little light headed all day. But more energy a little I’ve been able to stay awake ha. I ate a cookie, banana, salmon, egg roll, ice cream today. Idk. My spirits r still in the gutter which sucks. Like I’m just waiting to hemorrhage again yk. Even though I shouldn’t I just am waiting for it. Ugh. Idk. I just want the right side to be completely healed so I can know that that is for sure done yk 

DAY 13-4 
I slept with my mouth open all fucking night n it’s so dry. Ugh fuck. Obviously I instantly was chugging water to rehydrate it. I hope that didn’t fuck anything up. Feels like I got a weird lump in my throat 
Pretty sure I’m swallowing my uvula everytime I swallow. Super uncomfortable but whatever I guess. Tmrw is day 5 which starts the risk of bleeding again. Not excited for that. I do have 2 weeks off yet so I’m hoping to get so fully healed. Gawd this turned to a nightmare real quick. 
But no real pain. Ate eggs for breakfast n noodles at Olive Garden for supper 

DAY 14-5
No pain. I’ve stopped taking any medicines. My stomach been hurting n I’m gonna assume it’s bc of them so. 
Same update. Right side of healing fine. Left is whatever. Swollen n gross

DAY 15-6
Same shit. No pain no meds no issues. Stomach is better. My teeth have been sensitive. I’m hoping it’s referred pain
Sike. I had a wicked headache all day but I also didn’t drink as much water as I usually do so far. N ear pain on n off. Nothing unbearable tho 
Just looked n the biggest scab that was on the right fell off! That’s good. I was scared for that one bc that’s where I started bleeding in the other side. So that’s cool 
Just looked again n my left side scabs look very pink in a good way! That is so exciting. I’m so ready to go back to work dude 

DAY 16-7
Ok not as much of the left scabs fell off as I thought but they still r coming off nicely which is cool. The pic I took yesterday made it look way more healed than it was lol but it’s still doing good. No pain so far today. Had a random ear ache for a little bit but yea looking goooood right side has one small scab left 

DAY 17-8
No pain. More scabs are off 
Smthn I have forgotten to mention. Anesthesia fuckssss up my digestive system like I have either been shitting my brains out or completely plugged up this whole time. More plugged than not but I’m not taking narcos. Idk that hurts my stomach real bad rn so I’m going to Walmart for laxatives lol. Maybe it isn’t even related n I’m spilling too much ahha

DAY 18-9
Forgot to update bc nothing exciting 

DAY 19-10
Made it thru the night no hemorrhaging so I think we’re over the hill now 

DAY 20-11 (Saturday) 
I go back to work next Monday finally thank god 

ONE WEEK FROM LAST RESPONSE 
the rest of the week I healed fine. All my scabs r gone now. Some unconventional things I experienced were I had literally zero pain this entire time. I ate whatever I wanted. I had energy. I could talk. And my scans didn’t come off in chunks they just went away. so yea did my worst nightmare happen n I hemorrhaged yea but it was overall such an easy recovery. That was traumatizing int he ER but I feel so good now. I hope I’m on the road to healthy forever lol 

POST OP August 6th
Doc says I’m still swollen back there which is normal bc it takes 3 full months for it to go down but everything else looked good 

AUGUST 11 
Had surgery July 9th. I just looked bath there n I haven’t two bumps where my tonsils were. I don’t like that. I’m nothing medical but I feel like they’re growing back then. Fml. The right one has white spots wtffffff. Will update as I go bc I read some other reddits n they said the same bumps went away after awhile so I’ll update later 

September of the following year: I have never made a better decision than just going through with it. You’re not gonna die. Do it 

Sorry if this was all so much to read n I hope I have good updates 100% worth it n my recovery was a breeze minus the hemorrhage",1,1760130697.0,Tonsillectomy,0,1.0,False
1o3d5tm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o3d5tm,A stray my family bonded with was hit by a car in front of our house,"We had a neighborhood stray snowshoe Siamese ""live"" in our yard for the past 3 years. In that time, he got to know us & would run out from wherever he was to say ""hi"" & sit near us when we were outside. He never got close enough to pet but he would sit within a foot or 2 of us for long periods, stretching, showing his belly, & napping, whether we were having coffee in our backyard, reading a book on our front porch, or doing yard work. He interacted with our indoor cats through the windows. He didn't have any interest in being touched or coming inside, but it was clear we were friends due to how comfortable he was around us. He loved being outside & prowling the neighborhood, but he'd always return to the home base of our yard a few times a day.

Wednesday morning as I was dressing myself for work, I looked out the bedroom window at the street. All clear. I went to the closet to get a shirt & put it on. Less than 2 minutes away from the window. I looked out the window again & our stray friend was lying motionless in the street. I ran downstairs half dressed, grabbed a carrier to transport him to an emergency vet, but he had already passed. He had suffered head trauma from a speeding car & likely went immediately. All in that 2 minutes I was away from the window.

I'm grieving almost as much as I would one of my own cats. He wasn't ""mine"" - or anyone's, really, as we checked for a chip before we took him to get cremated - but he was a friend who my wife & I had a relationship with. Other neighbors knew & loved him, too. I had to break the news to a few & they were devastated but glad to know since they had been looking for him. Just wanted to put this out there to memorialize him in some way. We're petitioning the city to add speed humps to our street since a lot of people who don't live here started using our street as a cut through recently & fly down it like it's a main street. This is the third cat hit by a car in as many months & I feel like I have to prevent this from happening to other cats in our community. It's the least I can do to commemorate the memory of a sweet stray boy who was taken too soon by a careless driver.",10,1760130677.0,cats,1,1.0,False

I did hemorrhage tho,"This is going to be a way too detailed account of my tonsillectomy for the other worriers like me. I read thru pages n pages n pages of stories. So I’m hoping to compile literally everything I learned in one place. 

IF YOU WANT PICS, message me 


PREP FOR SURGERY 
I didn’t drink alcohol for over a month. No weed. No nicotine for over month either. Low caffeine. Drank sooo much water. I eat very healthy n organic n exercise regularly too. I’m a fairly healthy person. Female 23yo 125lbs. 
For food I got(all organic, no dairy, no spice) unsweetened applesauce, baby puff snacks, protein shakes non dairy, non dairy yogurts, eggs, tuna packets, apple juice, suckers, noodles, and honey. To start 
I ordered an ice cube tray for little ice 
Just to mention my tonsils are insanely huge. Just ugly ginormous balls in the back of my throat 

SURGERY TIPS 
Water. Idgaf how bad it hurts. Get water down. They said if I don’t get any food in it’s fine bc the body will figure that out as long as you have enough water in you 
Take care of yourself long before surgery. If you go in with a shit first and shit body, you’re gonna have a shit outcome 
Get a support system together as best you can to come check on you and cook or clean whatever find you closest in network ER in case of any complications 
Honestly just get your whole house in order the best you can, cleaned, laundry done, have comfy clothes picked out, have food ready and prepped, get your liquid ibuprofen and liquid Tylenol before the surgery (I did not n hated going to Walmart drowsy-mom drove-)
And apparently plan to spend a month off work but still pay ur bills lol I’m fine, but I can understand how that would be hard for some


DAY OF SURGERY 
Surgery is extremely anxiety provoking for me. I don’t like not being in control. That said I cried from the moment I stepped into the hospital(8am) until they gave me the funny drug before knocking me out. Every other surgery, it has felt like my eyes shut n I blink n I’m back up. This when felt like I actually stayed asleep n woke up from a nap. Not a bad thing. 
They said my surgery was the most smooth tonsillectomy they had ever seen and expect my recovery to be the same way. So fingers crossed for that. Definitely helped my spirits a little. 
Upon waking up I felt fine. Throat was fine but obviously had smthn done to it. I could take. I drank apple juice and ate apple sauce n half a cup of ice chips. In about 20 minutes I was up, dressed, peed, and ready to leave. I still felt groggy but I was fine. In the car I noticed they busted tf out of my lip. Like it’s red swollen looks like I got punched n the sides of my lips where they fold are very raw n bad. Not painful just damn 
Once I got home I ate a scrambled egg bc I wanted smthn in my stomach with protein before the numbing wore off. So egg and some water. Then I took a nap. Woke up and ate some off those melting baby puffs-strawberry banana I SWEAR by these. They instantly melt down n are easy to swallow. Get them. no they’re not acidic. Plus they have a bit of vitamins in them which will help everything. I also ordered a mini square ice cube tray off Amazon. So I had a few ice chips with my girl dinner. After waking up from the nap I can feel the numbing wearing off. This would be 4 hours after surgery n my uvula is just insanneeeee swollen in size lol. Pain so far is about a 2/10. Resting is fine. When I swallow it’s a little rough but not crazy. Talking doesn’t hurt it just takes a lot of effort so I’m trying to keep it to a minimum. I don’t want to baby myself too much bc it seemed like the girlies that did that ended up worse. I’m looking for the happy medium between rugged and princess. I ate a lot today. Total 3 eggs, sorbet, puffs, applesauce, 2apple juice, lots of water. 

DAY 2
No real pain again. Just discomfort when talking and swallowing. I don’t have a lot of energy but enough to mosey around. 
Oatmeal for breakfast and apple juice. Lots of water yet. 
I was hoping for more of an update but I ate an egg and some baby potatoes with a ranch tuna packet. Had some decaf coffee. I have virtually no pain. Just very uncomfortable feeling in my throat and I can’t talk loudly. 
Eating fresh cookies and ice cream now 
Overall recovery is going flawlessly. I hope to be one of the lucky ones but everyone thinks that until day 5/6 comes around. But we will see! I am hopeful 

DAY 3
 My throat is a little swollen but besides that same as the last two days. No pain. Just discomfort. Talking is a little more rough bc the swelling pushed my jaw forward so I have a lisp lol. I haven’t mentioned this yet but I take Tylenol every 4 hours and ibuprofen every 4 hours but staggered so I’m taking one every 2 hours n I really think that’s why I’m doing so well. That n how in depth I prepped for this ahead of time. 
Ate 2 eggs this morning n some half caf coffee. Going to attempt to eat pancakes for lunch. Ate chicken for supper n mushy vegetables 
Today was good. No but change. I can tell I’m swelling a bit tho. I did go for a walk today. 30 min slow walk. Felt good to move 

DAY 4

I’m a little more swollen that yesterday in my throat. It feels like pressure mostly. One of the scabs has some red spots in it which concerns me so I’m gonna Reddit dive. No blood in my spit or anything tho 
I’m noticeably more tired today than the other days but I’m gonna chalk that up to not eating enough. Like I’m trying my best but really I’m not eating enough regardless. Had potatoes n tuna for supper 
I sat outside a lot today which may have been not the best idea in the works bc it was super hot but i definitely also drank so much water so I think it was fine 

DAY 5
When I woke up today I had a bit of real pain 3/10. Just all over in my throat after doing my morning routine tho it went away. Just more discomfort again. Still slight pain in my ear. Ate eggs n sausage for breakfast. Cookie n coffee later in the day. 
I definitely had some intermittent pain throughout the day. Nothing crazy. 3/10 at most. N it was more just irritating pain than PAIN pain yk. Ate more eggs and sorbet and noodles for supper. 
My ice cold water is starting to b painful. N my tongue is starting to hurt which is weird but I’m assuming is the referred pain. I have a feeling tmrw might b rough. 
When I look in my throat, yea I see the scabs but they don’t look to be falling off which is supposed to b the start of the pain, and there’s some dark blood spots in them. U can see in the pictures. I only found 2 other posts that mentioned them n neither of them had said if it was fine or not. I’m assuming it was tho lol idk. But today was the roughest so far but not even rough. Tmrw I’m gonna get (decaf) coffee n then read my books the rest of the day. Not that I did a lot today but yea 
I’m starting to get nervous for the possible hemorrhage when they fall off bc dr said it’s days 5-9 most commonly. But again my entire recovery has been sooooo smooth. Oh I notice I get a little extra swollen if I talk a lot 

DAY 6
Last night I woke up at 4am for medicine n I was in pain. Probably the worst pain so far 4.5/10 but I fell back asleep after n when I woke at 6am it was gone. Weird little burst. N again I’m only taking Tylenol n ibuprofen staggered n the children’s dose of it. But again just discomfort. It’s harder to swallow today. Talking is the same. Gonna get coffee n food soon. I’m impatiently waiting for these scabs to fall off so I can be done healing. Scabs has a little pink hue to them today

DAY 9
No pain today. Swallowing n talking r a little easier. Just a little tho. I think we’re on the up n out 
I keep forgetting to take my meds n I still have no pain so that’s cool. This whole thing has been so much easier than I thought it would be 
Smthn I forgot to mention is foood constantly gets stuck in the scabs pockets. I don’t irrigate it like wisdom teeth removal I just drink water n lightly swish around my throat to get it out 

DAY 10-1 (dash for restarting)

Stay tuned for part 2!,"1st Row : Actress Tatum O’ Neil and her brother Patrick, C.Z. Guest ( nyc socialite & capotes swans),  and JFK Jr. speaking to Kelly. 

2nd Row : Bruce Weber (iconic photographer), Kelly Klein w/ Anna Wintour (Vogue editor), and actor Mathew Modine w/ Caridad Rivera. 

3rd Row : Model Rachel Williams w/ a friend, Calvin Klein w/ pool boys, and CK model Michael Bergin sitting as a lifeguard. 

The party hosted by Anna Wintour and Calvin Klein to celebrate the publication of Kelly Klein's new book, 'Pools,' featuring some of the world's most exquisite swimming pools, in the pool room. Eye: Kelly's Pool Party. 

From Michael’s 📖 book 👇🏻

Michael : One morning, shortly after I left the Paramount, I got a fateful call from Click about a gig for Calvin Klein. Well, not Calvin exactly, it was for his wife, Kelly. She had just finished a book about swimming pools, one of those expensive coffee table tomes, and she was celebrating by throwing a party at a swanky Manhattan penthouse with a rooftop swimming pool. Kelly wanted to hire five guys to wander around the pool in nothing but their underwear. They were supposed to look like lifeguards, only more perfect and more ravishing. The job paid $300.

This was around 1992, I didn’t want to do it— there was a pretty good chance I’d run into Carolyn— but I didn’t have much choice. It was a job. It could lead to other jobs. And I needed the money.

So that’s how I found myself traipsing around a chic, Manhattan, pool party in my Calvin Klein underwear, along with four other hunks of beef. We were ornaments— just there to look pretty and scrumptious. It was humiliating. Then again, what was I whining about? That’s what models did. That’s what they were for. What had I expected? That someone would actually mistake me for a human being?

And then, just as I’d feared, there, she was, coming through the front door, and slowly working her way through the crowded room. My heart began beating like crazy. I try to keep my distance— tried to keep the pool between us— but I’d already seen her looking at me. I watched her now as she began to inch her way over, pausing here and there to kiss someone hello. 

I was so embarrassed I’d thought I’d implode. 

Carolyn: How are you Michael?

Michael: I looked into her eyes and fell in love all over again. I replied to her saying “Good”. I tried to say it hard, try to show a little anger, a little coldness. But I didn’t feel any anger or any coldness. I felt longing.

Carolyn: You look great. 

Michael: she had obligations to fulfill as a publicist, and talking to me, for any length of time might have struck some people as unseemly. 

Carolyn: “Can we chat later?” 

I said, sure, but I didn’t get my hopes up. She moved off, and I watched her go. I felt like a wimp, like at the very least, I should have copped a little attitude. 

Suddenly, there was a commotion near the front door, and I saw the photographer’s trampling one another in their haste to get there. JFK Jr. had just arrived. He smiled and posed gamely for pictures. He posed for a shot with Calvin. He posed again with Kelly. He posed a third time with both Calvin and Kelly. People, mostly women, stared. 

Then John Jr. broke away and crossed the room, and I noticed Carolyn standing discreetly off to one side, quietly watching. She smiled at him, he leaned close and kissed her on the cheek. Okay. Fine. It was nothing. We live in a kissy society. They were just friends. Really. Why was it bothering me anyway? Carolyn and I were history. Still, there was something there that bothered me: she and John Jr. had that same easy familiarity. I’d notice back at Joe’s Café, when Carolyn spoke to Jason at the bar. Clearly there was something more to this relationship than Carolyn had admitted. 

At that moment, almost as if she could hear my thoughts, she turned and caught me watching her from across the distance. Then John Jr. Leaned in for a quick kiss, and hurried towards the door, with the paparazzi once again, hot on his tail.

Questions : 

Why are there no pictures of Carolyn at this event? This was such a huge event for Kelly Klein.  There are pictures of John and Michael and other guests at this event but no Carolyn. 

Why would Carolyn need to speak to Michael after the pool party if they were history (per Michael)? What would she need to say to him? 

** Remember John was still in a heavy relationship with Daryl Hannah.

Looking back, I see how pressured I was into making things official and some red flags I really should not have overlooked.

I recently went on a weekend trip with him and my closest friends who are married. Other than seeing my besties, the weekend went badly. My friends couldn’t believe some of the things he said/did, and overall it’s glaringly obvious that this relationship isn’t for me. 

My friend says I should just end it over text. However, I’ve always been told that doing it any way except for face to face is cold. I do have some concerns about how he would take it, and I worry that he would drag it out and attempt to wear me down for hours. He doesn’t drink coffee so going somewhere like a coffee shop would set off alarm bells, and I think it would be weird to do over dinner. I’m worried he might try to embarass me if it’s in public. But most of all, I just really don’t want to be at his apartment. 

I wouldn’t say I’m worried for my safety, but I am worried that he will call me names, want to rehash the same things multiple times, and try to convince me to stay, then get upset when I won’t. 

I do have something that he asked me to pick up for him from the store, so I do need to get that to him at some point.

How would you do this? 

For some insight, I’ve never really been in a situation where I’ve had to “plan” a breakup. My longest relationship ended mutually in the middle of a hard conversation.

He hasn’t been doing good for a while now and it was just his time. I don’t know or care what I believe in religiously, but regardless he is in a better place now whatever that means or looks like. Even though he was just my stepdad, he was the most father-like figure in all of my life and for all intent and purposes he was my dad. He fully believed, cared, and acted like my siblings and I were his biological-true children. He loved us just as much as his actual biological children. I can’t express enough how amazing of a person he was and how much myself and everyone looked up to him. I was very close with him and could literally tell him anything without fear of judgement.

Before dad passed, I was on next-to no contact with my nMom for a few months which unfortunately included him because she would use his phone to call me. She knew I would answer his calls and not hers. Dad and I would talk about her anytime she wasn’t around and he felt safe to. He found out over the years, it was easier to shut up out of fear and to just make her happy rather than to “ruffle feathers” as he would say. He was more so one of her many victims than abetting her. I did A LOT of standing up for him, that likely ended up in more verbal abuse for him in the end. (I’m so sorry dad.) She is a very manipulative and nasty mean person who suffers from bipolar disorder, severe depression, anxiety and PTSD (there is more there that hasn’t been officially diagnosed including her narcissistic personality, but I will leave it at what has been diagnosed). I made very clear to my nMom that I did not like the way she treated me, all the kids(including step kids), and dad, therefore I needed space. She would routinely break my clear boundaries I had set every few weeks to say something hurtful or accuse me of something, then in the same breath ask why I was doing this to them. One of these times, she made my dad (who had recently two toes amputated and a sensitively healing open wound— he was in a nursing home, but dad requested to continue all his appointments from home — he was so sick of hospitals/nursing homes by this point) walk back and forth from the car to my front door STEP (yes there was a small step that he could hardly get up the one step without completely losing his balance even with his walker) all because she couldn’t face me/I was being “too mean” and “made her upset” that I wouldn’t talk to her. 

I got the call at 2 am that dad had passed and since I was less than 5 minutes from the hospital, I was there very quickly. My mother and I hugged his body until he went cold. She was already starting to act and say really weird/off/hurtful things, but I gave her full benefit of the doubt because she was already actively mourning deeply. She didn’t want to be alone, so for the first time in months, she came over to my house and stayed the night. 

When we “woke up” after each getting maybe an hour or two of what I would loosely describe as sleep, I was deeply numb and left with all the hurt I still had from my mother standing face to face with her again. She continued to make weird comments that just made me uncomfortable. I sat outside with my cup of coffee like dad and I would do when he still physically could. He liked to either be alone or knew I would sit out there and just be quiet with him. Eventually we would chat after the coffee soaked in, but we could be just be peacefully quiet and still really enjoy each other’s company. Thats just the kind of guy my dad was. When mom found me outside with my coffee she got upset and left, saying we(my husband and I) “didn’t want her there.” At no point did I say that, in fact we had invited her to stay the night with us, so we were really confused.

Over the course of the day, I’m getting numerous texts, calls, emails, posts, comments, and people stopping by. Some asking questions, some wanting hugs/comfort, and some just talking about good times with dad. Everyone grieving in their own ways. Note: I’m 28F and I’ve never had anyone die in my life. My maternal grandma died young when my mother was still a baby, and everyone else just didn’t exist in my life. We didn’t know them or my then single-mother kept them from my brother and I for some dumb grudge or whatever her reasoning is; we have a very tight circle between the three of us before she met dad. So the grieving process is entirely new to me and I don’t know what to do or how any of it works. 

Still on the same brutally long day dad passed, my mother requested to come over again later in the day and was very unclear about why, what for, or when. I was clearly hesitant but I said yes. She came over, we gave her hugs at the door, sat down, and then she immediately got upset again, restating the “didn’t want her here” narrative, said I “wouldn’t look at her,” and left after no more than 1 minute of being in my house. She called several times asking “going forward, are we never going to talk again?” and telling me that “we’re all just grieving” hanging up on me every time. 

My nMom has a sister whom she is not speaking with and has her blocked right now. Mom wouldn’t even tell her sister that dad had passed when mom was making all the calls. I had to tell her. I was scared my nMom would cut me off further, not letting me have anything of my dad’s to remember him by and preventing me from going to his service/memorial. It’s been established that my mom is fortunately not in control of dad’s service, that no one is “uninvited” from going to it, and that someone(my siblings) will make sure I have something of dads(a shirt, a hat) to remember him by. My stepsister has also confirmed that she will keep me and my aunt informed on anything related to the memorial/service. I’m still concerned with how erratic my nMom is acting, she will do something rash like destroy, get rid of, or sell some of my dad’s things without talking to anyone. My aunt has confirmed she is also concerned and has done a similar behavior in the past with items lended to my mother. 

Today is the next day, my mother had a whole sob-story about asking/needing to “calmly talk to me” as if I’m the one stirring things up. I told her I’m not comfortable talking to her without someone else present. Both nearby siblings were busy today, but agreed that this Sunday would be a good time for everyone (both siblings) to get together for all of us to talk. My mother did not like this and proceeded to send me multiple texts and call me several times demanding to talk to specifically me right now. In the past, she likes to call and demand that she be “taken off of speakerphone” where my husband could hear her. She immediately dives into her manipulative tactics, this time preying on mine/her grieving and “just resolving this” because she “needs me.” It’s also clear to me that mom is withholding letting me have a shirt/hat without “making peace” with her first. She won’t let anyone come over to her house right now since multiple people have discussed wanting something of dad’s or securing an item on my behalf. Her grieving has made her especially erratic at least towards me(possibly towards others too that she already wasn’t on good-terms with). 

I’m not hopeful that any discussion Sunday would do any good for my mother and I’d relationship at least. She is not listening to what I have to say, rolling right over any reasonable accountability, and just wanting to get to the part where we are talking again. In the past, unfortunately I have caved I what I naively thought was being the bigger person to just apologize and move on. She knows I am weak to her emotional narratives of “just needing her daughter,” “her baby” because I was the one to front the emotional dump of all her adult real-world problems as a very young child wiser beyond my years at the time. Now, I’m exhausted, burn out, hurt, tired of “being the bigger person”, tired of just accepting her behavior, tired of not saying something, tired of not sticking to my beliefs/opinions/boundaries. I’m traumatized to her flippant, emotionally manipulative, erratic behavior where I’m scared of every phone call, text, and car that pulls up in my driveway. So I ask you Reddit, am I just being an asshole daughter not supporting her mother during her time of grieving? ",1,1760129939.0,raisedbynarcissists,4,1.0,False

The pace of Battlefield is one if its main appeals to me. I enjoy picking a map based on what I want to do in the game. If I want fast, frenetic, close-in fights I'll pick a map with lots of indoor combat. If I want slower-paced more strategic gameplay, I'll pick a huge map with loads of open space. But even on ""bigger"" maps it feels like BF6 is just a run-and-gun, no brains spray-and-pray fight constantly with enemies always near you.

Last year I went hiking with a girl.
It was our first date — and, as it turned out, the last.
Not sure if that’s a good or a bad thing.

We were walking up the trail, and I casually mentioned that there was an eco-post nearby.
They had this thing going on — if you collect a bag of trash, they give you a free cold drink, lemonade or coffee.
I said it with genuine enthusiasm, like: “That’s actually a cool idea — you clean up nature a bit, get a drink, everyone wins.”

She looked at me… like I’d just said:

> “I’m so broke, I’d dig through bushes for lemonade.”



That look — pure disdain. Maybe disappointment.
But definitely not understanding.

In that moment I kinda regretted saying anything at all.
Because the idea wasn’t about the drink — it was about doing something good, something small, just because you can.

I didn’t ask her to pick up trash with me.
I just shared a thought that made me smile.

What might be going on here?","37F, 5'5"", 145lbs, Caucasian, no kids. No major medical history (sinus surgery last year) or history of illness, but had a hysterectomy 10 days ago to address long/heavy periods, a couple small fibroids, and sterilization. Bloodwork was good, overall health is fine. 

Took various anti anxiety/anti depressants in the past, but have been off of them for over a year. 

Pre surgery (and currently) I take: iron supplement 3x per week (with b12), sumatriptan as needed, Flonase at night, and Metamucil daily. I drink 1-4 cups of black coffee per day, and mostly water other than that. 

Post surgery: ibuprofen/Tylenol alternating, took 5mg oxy for 2 days after surgery, and stool softener.  

\------

**Possibly relevant history**:

I wasn't vaccinated as a child, but as far as I know got all caught up as a young adult. My chart notes say I'm overdue for a Hep C antibody test and Hep B vaccine, but I'm not sure if that is a documentation error due to years of changing doctors, or if that actually needs to be done. 

Drank heavily in my early 20s, smoked cigarettes, and did recreational drugs (no needles or anything like that, just coke and pills and what not). No more than the average early 20's bartender I'd imagine, but I certainly didn't take care of myself. 

Mid 20's, basically quit drinking/smoking cigarettes/fucking around, but picked up smoking weed and drinking kratom regularly (only kratom flower/powder, never extracts or anything synthetic). Around 2021 (4-5 years ago, I sobered up and quit weed and Kratom. I have at most 1 -2 drinks, once or twice a month because it messes with my sleep. 

When I sobered up, I put on some weight, 30lbs or so. Over the last year, I've cleaned up my diet significantly, lost all the weight, and am fairly active. I'd go so far as to say healthier than I've ever been.

I have been in a monogamous relationship for 13 years, and was tested for STDs after starting that relationship. Test was negative.

  
\-------

**Fast forward to now.** I had a full laparoscopic hysterectomy 10 days ago, and all of the bloodwork they did in advance of that was normal. Surgery was uneventful. During my post op video visit with my doc, she mentioned seeing something on my liver that looked like ""slight cirrhosis"", and asked if I drank more than my chart notes indicated. and I assured her I did not. My early 20's antics are not part of my medical record, I didn't go to the doctor back then. I did say that I drank more in my early 20's than I do now, but she wasn't concerned about it. She said that because I had no ""known history of hepatitis"" and wasn't a heavy drinker, she wasn't worried about it at all, and to basically forget about it, that it could have been nothing. 

I am an anxious person, and there is absolutely no chance I am going to be able to ""forget about it"". I am on a journey to improve my health and longevity/quality of live (hence the surgery) and this is scaring me. 

*Before I go to my PCP and ask for full bloodwork and a referral to a hepatologist, what might this be? Is there any variation of normal that could present this way? Other explanations for what she might have seen? Or, alternately, what would you recommend as next steps to have another doctor confirm there is nothing to worry about?* 

I know she took a pic of my liver during the surgery, but I won't have access to that until my follow up appointment next month. I'm happy to share the results of any other bloodwork, or answer any other questions. Thank you!",3,1760129808.0,AskDocs,5,1.0,False

Hey everyone,
I’m visiting Jaipur with a friend for 2 days (21st–23rd Oct) and staying at Holiday Inn Jaipur City Centre. Would love some local help on what to cover and where to hang out.

Looking for a mix of things:
	•	Authentic Rajasthani food — proper local thali or laal maas kind of place (not the super touristy ones if possible).
	•	Good coffee spots / rooftop cafes with a nice view or chill vibe.
	•	Nightlife / clubs / lounges that actually get lively on weekends.
	•	Any streets / markets worth walking around in the evening.
	•	Also, any smoking essentials / stores nearby worth checking out (rolling paper, filters, that sort of thing 🍃).
       •     Any Diwali parties or events happening on 21st night — something fun or unique we could check out.

We’re not doing the trip like a typical checklist tour — just want to experience the real vibe of Jaipur, eat well, meet people, and maybe catch a sunset or two from a fort.

Any local suggestions would mean a lot — hidden gems, local favorites, anything you personally love in the city.

The other day, during our weekly coffee social, two women began chatting. One was 82, the other 92. The older woman started speaking about death. She told us she wasn't afraid of death.  She said, “I want to hurry up and meet father.”

She wasn’t speaking in English, and in her language, “father” could mean either your own father or your children’s father. So, I asked, “You mean your dad?” She shook her head and said, “No. My husband.”

Then she added, “Every night I have dreams with him in it. And we are watching our little baby son take his first steps.” Her son is now in his 60s.

The way she said it—so vivid, so tender—hit me hard. . I have two kids  myself, and I suddenly remembered my own son’s first steps. That was 12 years ago for me. But for her , it was 60 years ago, and still, she dreams of it as if it happened yesterday.

I don’t know why I felt so overwhelmed. Maybe it was the way she spoke. Maybe it was the reminder that time slips by quietly, before you know it. Or the strong feelings she has to her son and husband.

I felt my eyes welling up. Life is so short. In that moment, I was reminded of my own humanity.  how deeply we’re all connected by love, memory, and longing. 

I’ve been told not to get too close with the seniors, but how can I stay detached when they share themselves so openly, so vulnerably? Moments like this aren’t just conversations, they’re glimpses into a lifetime.

Anyone else feel that way working with seniors?

I was excited to take it home and finally relive the original trilogy. As soon as I put it in I knew something was wrong. Distorted image, audio cutting in and out, would cut out to pure snowy noise after 10 seconds. I figured I would open it up and hand wind it and then try and rewind and fast-forward it a couple of times. After one failed attempt. Tried again, made a few minutes of progress, still stuck. Tried it on my back up Mitsubishi to the same effect. Feeling defeated I gave up. Went to put in another tape on my combo unit later in the day to sound but no picture(all static). Went to bed feeling like I just killed both my vcrs and effectively making my collection a huge paper weight. Woke up and after doing some research I found a reddit thread mentioning running a new blank through the combo unit for an hour or so to break up the clogged heads. I was able to make some makeshift head cleaning tools with coffee filters some rubber bands and isoppyl alcohol. A pain in the ass but managed to physically clean the heads then ran some tapes for a couple of hours and saw the static slowly disappear. I'm happy to report its back 100%. The back up vcr was easy since I could just take the lid off and clean the heads but I was worried my combo was toast. Thanks to this community I am back in working order.

I’ve tried the PF a couple of times with 40-click grind, and it seems to work okay—acceptable extraction—until it reaches the end, and the PF just slips out, with the group gasket popping out slightly. Then I unscrew the shower, and the gasket goes back into place by itself.

I also tried it with supermarket ground coffee, and it worked normally—actually, it wasn’t a bad shot for a cheap supermarket coffee.

Questions:

* Am I grinding too fine for the bottomless portafilter?
* Could this be an issue with the Dedica gasket or portafilter itself?
* Any tips for preventing the PF from slipping and the gasket from popping out?

The machine is practically brand new, only a month of daily use. I’ll definitely try grinding coarser tomorrow—but maybe someone has had a similar problem and knows exactly what’s happening.

I did find another post on the sub from a couple of years ago, but the comments weren’t very helpful—they just advised throwing the Dedica away and buying a Gaggia Classica. That’s not really an option for me, as I’m happy with the Dedica as is, even if I can’t use the bottomless portafilter perfectly.

I've been an alcoholic for 10 years, and I've used it to 'combat' my autism/masking

Disclosure: 26F, neurodivergent, and major depressive disorder I take prozac. 

I've gone 36 days sober (straight edge too) and I'm so fucking bored and dopamine deprived. 

I work out everyday to distract myself, eat healthy, quit smoking, eat healthy no junk food, my only vice is a teaspoon of Nutella maybe once a week.  Initially It was more serotinin boosting in the first few weeks. But now I'm just fucking depressed. 

Everyday I'm doing the right things staying motivated putting in the work but it feels like I have to fight hard for just a baseline feeling of normality that's depleating. 

I feel best in the mornings when I have coffee, workout and do work. But in the afternoon and evenings I'm struggling. 

Soon I'm going to go on a trip and stay with a boy in talking to in America for a while. He knows about my drinking issues and he's seen me drunk and sober and is proud of me for quiting. He has had his ups and downs in the past but is pretty much a straight edge dude. I'm worried that I won't have the energy for social events as I have autism and I used alcohol to mask. I'm also worried that these feelings of boredom and depressed will be exaggerated. 

I really want a substitute that I can take for alcohol. Just something that I will still feel in control.

Decades later, we discovered one of them was my mother’s father","My maternal grandmother used to work for a Jewish family in Mexico City. From a very young age, she began working in a textile factory and gradually rose through the ranks to become a personnel supervisor. She later served as a secretary, an accountant, and eventually the administrator of a large condominium. She worked for this family for many years.🏭

When she started working there, her employer’s children were between 5 and 10 years old, while she herself was around 13 to 15. This was in the late 1950s. By the early 1970s, my grandmother held a trusted position, and those children were now adults. During those years, she developed a sentimental relationship with one of them.👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨

In 1973, when my mother was born, my grandmother was 33, and my mother’s father around 23. My grandmother never told my mother the truth about her origins. She only shared fragments of her story with me — how the sons of her first employer had already taken over their father’s businesses and were now her superiors and some other casual stuff.🤷🏾‍♀️

She told me that when my mother was born, her employers ensured she received the best medical care during the pregnancy, and when she gave birth, they filled her hospital room with flowers. They took care to make sure both she and my mother had everything they needed, always ensuring their comfort and wellbeing.💐

One of my great-aunts, my grandmother’s sister, once recalled that the first time my grandmother brought my mother to work, her father held her with great tenderness, kissed her, and wept with emotion. A few years after my mom was born, my great grandmother found my grandparents kissing.😳

My grandmother was the only employee allowed to bring her daughter to work. Until the age of about six or eight, my mother grew up within that condominium, playing with other Jewish children and attending many social gatherings. My grandmother always told her not to become emotionally involved with any Jewish men, saying, “They’re different from us — they don’t mix with us.”😮‍💨

Eventually, my grandmother left that job, moved to another city, got married, and my mother grew up with a different father figure — one who unfortunately was not a good man. But that's another story.😶

She never told my mother who her real father was, nor did she ever ask him for help. It wasn’t until her final days, almost five years ago, that she revealed his name. She also told my mother that his family had originally come from Aleppo, Syria, that they were of Arab-Jewish descent, and that they had arrived in Mexico around 1925. She told her that my mother had been his first-born daughter.👁️👄👁️

Recently, we began searching for this man. Not for any material reason, but simply to know him. To meet him. To hear his story. To understand where he came from, who his parents and grandparents were, to learn about his culture, and maybe to receive a kind word — a trace of connection that could bring peace to my mother’s heart.🖤

My mother grew up without a father, built her own life, and today she’s a grandmother herself — strong, self-reliant, and full of dignity. She’s not looking for a father figure. She only wishes to meet someone she once believed had died long ago, or perhaps had never truly existed.🤷🏾‍♀️

Through Facebook, we located one of my grandfather’s relatives, who told us that he is battling advanced cancer. Sadly, this relative has closed all possibility of contact between them.🚫

There is nothing I would love more than to help my mother see him — even just once, to share a brief conversation, a coffee, a moment of understanding.☕

Not here to overshare — where’s the fun in giving it all away upfront? Just know this: I’m the type to remember your coffee order, challenge you to a push-up contest, and maybe leave you wondering what just hit your heart a little.

I’ve been a solo business owner for 11 yrs (body waxing, brows, facials). I have a pretty high tolerance for the things that come up with clients. Like many of you, I compartmentalize and move on. But lately… 2 have really been testing my limits, and I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced similar situations.

Client #1:
She’s been coming every 4 wks for 2 yrs for an extended bikini. Hygiene is beyond questionable~ honestly, revolting. I try to not judge and I usually can go nose blind. She predictably arrives sweaty, unkempt, with remnants and debris (threads, bits of paper, TP, even fecal matter) between folds. It’s as if she hasn’t showered in a week. Her feet? Sweaty, dirty nails, grimy toes~ and sometimes I need to position them. She’s also very overweight, so there’s about triple the surface area. I power through, holding my breath under my mask, then airing out the room after she leaves. She never tips either, unlike the majority of my clients.

Client #2:
This one is tough because she’d become more of a friend~ we did yoga, brunch, coffee dates. She’s thoughtful and socially aware, which makes this harder to wrap my head around. She always came a bit sweaty from class, which I tolerated. But her last visit was straight from hot yoga …literally drenched, tank top soaked, hair wet, face sticky. She even said, “sorry I’m so sweaty.” I was grossed out and floored by the lack of consideration.

At the end of the day, I try to stay professional. I probably won’t change anything or say anything - I wanted to come here and just get this off my chest. Thanks for hearing me out!",7,1760129008.0,Esthetics,4,0.9,False

1o3cead,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductivityApps/comments/1o3cead/i_spent_6_months_building_a_relationship_os_after/,"I spent 6 months building a ""relationship OS"" after losing a $500K partnership because I forgot to follow up. Still in beta, still has bugs, but it's already changing how I work.","**TL;DR:** We have apps for tasks, notes, calendars, and finances. But nothing for maintaining the relationships that actually drive our careers. So I built one. Here's what I learned.

# The Stupid Mistake That Started This

Last year I had drinks with a VP at a $2B company. Amazing conversation about a potential partnership worth \~$500K to my startup.

I said ""Let's follow up next month.""

**I forgot.**

Three months later, I see on LinkedIn they announced the exact partnership... with my competitor.

I checked my phone. Our conversation was buried under 847 contacts. No reminder. No system. No context about what we even discussed.

Just... vibes.

# The Realization

I have apps for everything:

* **Tasks** → Todoist
* **Notes** → Notion
* **Calendar** → Google Cal
* **Finance** → Tracking every dollar
* **Health** → Tracking my steps, sleep, water intake
* **Habits** → Streaks, routines, everything

But for **the single most valuable thing in my professional life** \- the relationships that lead to opportunities, deals, partnerships, jobs - I had... my iPhone's contacts app from 2010.

No interaction history. No context. No intelligence. Just names and phone numbers.

**That's insane.**

# What I Tried (The Graveyard Tour)

Before building anything, I tried everything:

**Traditional CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive):**

* Built for sales teams, not individuals
* Treating people like ""leads"" felt gross
* 4+ hours of setup, gave up after 2 weeks
* Mobile experience was terrible

**Personal CRMs (Clay, Folk, Dex):**

* Better UI, still too manual
* Still required ME to remember everything
* Expensive for what they offered
* Stopped using after a month

**DIY Solutions (Notion, Airtable templates):**

* Spent 3 hours setting up the ""perfect system""
* Used it for 9 days
* Maintaining it became harder than the original problem

**My Phone + Calendar Reminders:**

* Created 23 reminders: ""Follow up with Sarah""
* WHO THE HELL IS SARAH?
* Zero context, zero intelligence
* Just noise

**Executive Assistant (for 3 months):**

* This actually worked!
* Cost: $3,500/month
* Only affordable because I was desperate

The EA experiment taught me something: **The solution isn't remembering MORE. It's having a system that remembers FOR you.**

# The Core Problem Nobody's Solving

Every tool I tried expected ME to do all the cognitive work:

* *When should I reach out to John?* → You figure it out
* *What did we talk about last time?* → You remember
* *Why am I reaching out now?* → You come up with a reason
* *Which relationships need attention?* → You notice

But I'm running a company. You're managing a career. We're all juggling a million things.

**We don't need more databases. We need intelligence.**

# What I'm Building (The Honest Version)

After almost quitting 3 times, here's what exists right now in Kindred:

# What Actually Works:

**1. Smart Reminders with Context**

Not: ""Follow up with John""

But: *""John mentioned his Series A raise was happening in Q4. It's October now. Perfect time to congratulate him and revisit that partnership you discussed at the conference.""*

The system learns from your notes and past interactions to suggest when and WHY to reach out.

**2. Relationship Health Tracking**

You can see:

* Which important relationships are going cold (visual indicators)
* Your interaction patterns over time
* Relationship lifecycle (new connection → active → dormant → re-engaged)
* Who you're actually investing time in vs. who you're ignoring

**3. Hybrid AI Timeline**

Every contact has a timeline showing:

* All your past interactions (calls, meetings, notes)
* Context from those interactions
* Smart suggestions for next steps
* An AI assistant that helps you log interactions in seconds

Instead of typing ""Met with Sarah, discussed Q4 strategy, follow up in 2 weeks"" - you just tell the AI what happened and it structures everything.

**4. Contact Management That Doesn't Suck**

* Import from everywhere (phone, LinkedIn, email)
* Rich profiles with actual context, not just contact info
* Notes that matter (birthdays, important details, personal context)
* Search that works like your brain works

**5. Events System**

Track not just meetings, but:

* Private events (dinners, coffee chats)
* Local networking events
* Conference follow-ups
* Group interactions

All connected to the relationships involved.

**6. The AI Intelligence Layer**

This is the part I'm most excited about (and most scared to talk about because it's still beta):

The system learns:

* Your communication patterns
* Who's important to you based on interaction frequency
* When you typically reach out to different types of relationships
* What context is relevant for different people

Then it surfaces the right person at the right time with the right context.

**It's like having an executive assistant who knows your entire relationship history.**

# What's Still Broken (The Honest Part):

* There are bugs. I find new ones daily.
* Some features are half-baked.
* The AI occasionally suggests weird timing (working on it).
* Mobile app needs polish.
* Import process can be finicky.

I'm not pretending this is perfect. It's not. **But it's already better than the chaos I had before.**

# The Vision (Where This Is Going)

Ultimate goal: **Replace the executive assistant.**

Not the person - the function. The role of remembering who you know, what matters to them, when to reach out, and why.

Right now I'm doing this for relationships. But imagine:

* AI that drafts personalized follow-ups based on your last conversation
* Automatic meeting prep: ""You're meeting Sarah in 30 minutes. Here's what you talked about last time, here's what's happened in her world since then, here's what you should ask about.""
* Network intelligence: ""Three people in your network are in the same industry as this new lead. Want an introduction?""
* Relationship ROI: ""Your top 10 relationships have led to $340K in opportunities this year. Here's who you should invest more time in.""

**We're not there yet.** But the foundation is there.

# Why I'm Posting This

Three reasons:

**1. Validation**  
Is this a real problem for others, or is it just me? Do people actually WANT this level of relationship intelligence?

**2. Feedback**  
What am I missing? What would make this 10x better? What features matter most?

**3. Early Users**  
I need people who understand this problem to test this with me. Not people who want a perfect product - people who want to help BUILD the perfect product.

# The Uncomfortable Truth

Most people don't even realize they have a relationship management problem.

You think you're ""pretty good at staying in touch.""

Then you:

* Lose a deal because you forgot to follow up
* Miss a job opportunity because a connection went cold
* Feel guilty about not reaching out to someone important
* Scramble to remember what you talked about before a meeting
* Realize 90% of your network is dormant

**You don't know you need this until you use it.**

That's the challenge I'm facing. How do you convince someone they need a solution to a problem they don't consciously feel?

# Questions for This Community

I need your brutal honesty:

1. **Does this problem resonate?** Or am I solving something that doesn't actually matter?
2. **What's your current system?** How do YOU manage professional relationships right now?
3. **What's the relationship opportunity you lost?** The one that got away because of poor follow-up?
4. **What would make you trust an AI** with your relationship data? What are your privacy concerns?
5. **If this existed perfectly, how would it change your work?**

# The Offer

Kindred is live in beta. Free to try. Bugs included.

I'm not asking everyone to try it. **I'm looking for 50 people who feel this pain and want to help me build the solution.**

If that's you, comment or DM me. I'll send you access + a direct line to me for feedback.

If you just want to roast my approach or tell me why this won't work - even better. I can take it.",4,1760128891.0,ProductivityApps,5,0.83,False

My husband and I have been making coffee with a mocha pot or french press. We buy good beans and grind them ourselves. We decided that our gift to us for Christmas would be a coffee upgrade and our first espresso machine. I have been reading a couple of posts on this sub and would like to get some advice on what to buy. Our budget is $1000.  
We mainly drink Americanos but I would like to be able to make the occasional cappucino or latte.  
Our current thought is to get either the Bambino Plus or Gaggia Classic Pro E24 and the Baratza ESP or Turin DF54 grinder. Are there any other we should consider? Are there any major differences between them?  
I would also appreciate recommendations on YouTube channels to learn from :)",2,1760128844.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1o3ccn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1o3ccn1/us_was_this_an_internet_marketing_related_scam/,[US] Was this an “internet marketing” related scam?,"I was getting groceries the other day and this guy next to me in the aisle saw me looking for something and wanted to help. After that we spoke a little and talked about careers and mentioned if I was open to any new opportunities. Soon he said that he’s new to this area and wanted to see if he could get my number and we could meet for a cup of coffee sometime. I’m thinking why not I’m okay with making new friends. 

The next day he asked if we could meet, so we set a time up and met at this cafe. We spoke a little about each other, then he started asking me where I want to be in the next 5 years and about my ambitions. It almost felt like an interview. Then he asked what he does and he says internet marketing, at that point I was getting somewhat skeptical. 

He mentioned that the guys he works with have contracts with different manufacturers and they drive traffic to their companies etc. The weird part was when he said he’s more working on something and showed me his phone lock screen and it had a background of a community development plan. In my mind I was like who the hell would have that as their phone lock screen. 

After all that he said “let’s meet again in a few days and in the meantime I’ll send you some links of articles you could read so that we’re on the same page”. Now I’m just having a feeling that this is some type of scam but I don’t know where it’s going.",2,1760128786.0,Scams,8,0.75,False
1o3ccmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1o3ccmf/meds_when_barely_having_any_pvcs/,Meds when barely having any PVCs?,"I (38 year old female) felt like I was having heart palpitations so I made an appt with a cardiologist.

EKG normal, echo normal, two week heart monitor confirmed that they are PVCs but burden is only 0.02% so barely anything.

Cardio even said the monitor was ‘basically normal’ but yet he still wants me to take a beta blocker?? I would take daily medicine if I needed it, but why would I need it for this? I felt very frustrated after today’s appt. I knew the results and option of meds before today, this was just to discuss it all. I wanted to know if having them would cause damage to my heart or if it’s just an annoyance, and that never really got answered. So if I don’t have symptoms and my burden is so low, then why does it matter? Why do I need this medicine? Do I really need it? Does having PVCs cause damage or not?

He also told me I need to drink less alcohol (I drink 1-2 drinks maybe once every other week) and less have caffeine (I drink two serving of caffeine a day, one morning one afternoon, coffee or soda never energy drinks) also that I need to lose some weight (I’m 5’6’’ and 155 lbs) but that all feels very hard to do considering how little I do all of those things I consume. I’m am already working hard to lose some weight but I’m getting no where. Nurse suggested drink more water I already drink at least 60 oz a day. So I don’t know what more they want from me. Maybe that’s why I need the medicine? I know he’s a good because Dr my husband sees him too and he’s taken excellent care of him with complicated heart issues but today he just didn’t seem to be listening to me or saying anything remotely helpful. 

I don’t feel racing heart I only feel skipped beats. I said that but we didn’t discuss skipped beats we only discussed two times on the monitor that I had elevated heart rate. Once time I was cutting the grass, the other I was drinking heavily and I will cut the alcohol as suggested I know that’s bad anyway and it always triggers them but they also happen more often without than with.

Long discussion about Apple Watch that can track this and send those readings to them when I feel things but yet we did all these tests and they were all normal why would I need to do that?

Thank you for reading my vent. I’m just really frustrated. I don’t feel like anyone heard what I was concerned about or asking just babbled off some info and told me to take some pills I don’t want. I’m probably going to cancel follow up and not take them but maybe someone here can explain it where I can understand it.",2,1760128785.0,PVCs,4,1.0,False

1o3c9vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/perplexity_ai/comments/1o3c9vn/grocery_shopping_shortcut/,Grocery shopping shortcut,"Wow Effect: Wow
Time Needed: 9 min
Time Saved: 60 min

Groceries are just taxes on adulthood. And I don’t enjoy any part of it:
- planning what to eat,
- getting the ingredients,
- calculating portion sizes,
- calculating savings

So I built a reusable shortcut that takes dish names (“lasagna,” “butter chicken”) and does the rest:

- finds reliable recipes
- extracts the ingredients
- skips my pantry staples
- hunts down discounted organic products
- adds them all to my cart
- schedules next-day delivery
- calculates savings I made
- pastes the recipe I should use

All of that from 1 click! 

Even better - I live in Denmark, the shopping site was in Danish, so Comet had to translate everything real-time. And it did, without missing a beat. Handling a language that’s far from the world’s most widely spoken.

The effort‑to‑results ratio is mind-blowing. Even with a personal shopping assistant, re‑explaining over text would take longer than one click in Comet. It’s the most satisfying kind of automation: zero friction, fully personalized, and built for real life. 

You can grab my multi-step grocery shopping prompt below, all other shortcuts are shared via [Substack](https://open.substack.com/pub/karozieminski/p/perplexity-comet-advanced-use-cases-guide). Just swap in your store’s name and your preferences to make it your own:

Shortcut: /groceries

Prompt:

**Personal Grocery Price Shopper**
YOU ARE A PERSONAL SHOPPING + MEAL-PLANNING AGENT THAT WORKS EXCLUSIVELY ON [GROCERY_SITE_URL].

GOAL
When the user pastes one or more dish names, you: (1) find one reputable recipe per dish, (2) extract ingredients (metric, scaled to servings), (3) EXCLUDE pantry staples, (4) select products on [GROCERY_SITE_URL] with strict priority: discounted organic > discounted non-organic > non-discount organic > regular non-organic, (5) add everything to ONE shared cart, (6) schedule NEXT-DAY DELIVERY (local timezone), and (7) reply with a clean, HUMAN-READABLE MESSAGE ONLY (no JSON, no code blocks, no markup).

INPUT FORMAT
- Free text list of dish names (one per line or comma-separated). If servings are given (e.g., “Lasagna — 4 servings”), scale accordingly; otherwise default to 2 servings.

RECIPE SELECTION
- Choose ONE clear, non-paywalled, well-rated recipe per dish (e.g., Arla, Valdemarsro, BBC Good Food). Keep the URL for the user.

INGREDIENTS
- Convert to metric (g, ml, pcs). Scale to servings.
- EXCLUDE staples (do not add to cart): salt, pepper, sugar, flour, rice, pasta, oils (olive/neutral), butter, vinegar, soy sauce, baking powder/soda, stock cubes, coffee, tea, common dried herbs/spices.

[GROCERY_SITE_URL] SHOPPING RULES
- Site scope: ONLY [GROCERY_SITE_URL].
- Priority per ingredient: (1) discounted organic (on sale), (2) discounted non-organic, (3) non-discount organic, (4) regular non-organic.
- Match form correctly (fresh/frozen/canned), cut, fat %, etc.
- Choose the closest pack size to required quantity; avoid extreme oversizing unless cheaper per unit (note leftovers if any).
- If out of stock, pick the next-best option following the same priority.
- Merge duplicate ingredients across dishes; increase quantity instead of duplicating lines.
- Idempotent behavior: if re-run with the same dishes/cart, do NOT duplicate items already in cart.

DELIVERY
- Automatically select NEXT-DAY DELIVERY in the local timezone. If next-day is unavailable, pick the earliest available slot and clearly note it to the user.

SAVINGS
- Compute line-by-line savings for discounted items (original vs discounted) and sum a total “You Saved” amount.

OUTPUT
Return one plain-language message with these sections and formats:

1) Here’s What’s in Your Cart
- One line per item: “{qty} × {product_name} — {size} ({flags}) — unit {USD}, line total {USD}, saved {USD if any}”
- Flags example: “discounted, organic” or “organic, no discount”.
- End with totals: “Subtotal: USD X.XX  |  You Saved: USD Y.YY  |  Final Total: USD Z.ZZ”
- Delivery: “Delivery Slot: Tomorrow HH:MM–HH:MM” (or earliest slot if next-day unavailable)

2) Savings Report
- One or two sentences highlighting total savings and top 2–3 discounted items.

3) How to Cook Each Dish
- For each dish: “{Dish Name} ({servings} servings)”
- “Recipe Source: {URL}”
- 5–10 concise prep steps, metric units.

4) Notes & Substitutions (if any)
- Briefly list any substitutions due to stock or prices; note leftovers if pack sizes exceeded needs.

QUALITY & SAFETY CHECKLIST (SELF-CHECK BEFORE REPLYING)
- Only [GROCERY_SITE_URL] items used.
- Staples excluded from the cart.
- Discount/organic priority correctly applied.
- Metric units and quantities match servings.
- Next-day delivery set (or earliest noted).
- Savings arithmetic correct and totals consistent.
- Output is CLEAR TEXT ONLY

This is honestly one of llthe best shortcuts I built, I use it 1-2x a week. Second favorite is electricity pricing alerts. Hope it helps someone, enjoy!",2,1760128608.0,perplexity_ai,1,1.0,False

I'm trying to learn about Buddhism and so far in my research I pretty much agree with most of the teachings etc. and found some fascinating new perspective on things but I kinda wondered about drug use. Obviously being dependant on drugs or abusing them is bad. But is it also bad to, for example, have a beer once in a while when meeting up with friends? At the same time I wonder what even is considered a drug? Personally I have ADHD and depression and might get medication for it soon. But these medications alter the mind in a way, so would that be bad as well? I mean even coffee does to an extent alter the mind and might cause some anxiety for some people. I personally don't see the harm in the use of some drugs as long as one does not abuse them or become addicted. There is also research that some substances like certain psychedelics can help people that suffer from some mental illnesses like PTSD.

It is league season after all. My wife called me around 10 am to say her car had broken down. All that was needed was a new battery. We are currently in search of a new car for her, so spending the money was particularly painful. But that is besides the point. 

I found myself with the opportunity to go home once my time to impersonate a car mechanic was complete. I could have returned to work, but opted not to do so. Instead, I chose to go home and have a sammich (this may be commonly called a 'sandwich' in less civilized parts of the world) enjoy several hard ciders, and not 1 but 2 bowls of tobacco in my corn cob pipe. It simply seemed like too nice of a day to return to work.

I am new to the Episcopal world. So my question to you is this; what is the Episcopal stance on the afternoon I have described? Does the Protestant work ethic demand that I return to work and finish my day, or am I free to enjoy this glorious afternoon? Is the enjoyment of delicious cider permitted, or ought I have stuck to coffee? Is it ok to enjoy some pipe tobacco, or should I have perhaps burned some incense?

While I appreciate the +1's, I'm hoping for a healthy discourse not an echo chamber.

When I dine out, it's easily a 20-30% tip on my bill depending on service. Thankfully, I've never had service so bad that I've felt the need to dip lower than 20%.  
I understand that for most wait staff, they're only making a few dollars an hour so wait staff depend on tips to make a living.  
I also tip about as much on artistic services like haircuts, tattoos, etc. As there is a metric of how well someone performed said service.  
This post is for tipping discussion on services and goods outside of wait staff and art.

And please, before anyone comes for me, I've worked most these jobs, I've been homeless, I've been talentless, I know the struggle. These are just thoughts I have, I want you to change my mind and provide new perspectives.

As I understand tipping, it's a monetary gesture of ""You did a good job""

Why is there a tipping option for: 

**Wag/Rover/Other similar services**  
Providers are independent contractors, they set their own prices.  
If the job was unsatisfactory, I wouldn't hire them again. If it was satisfactory, I would. Is that not the same structure as mechanics, plumbers, day care, etc? What's the variation that I'd be tipping on? Feels kind of binary to me, you either did the job or you didn't.

**Baristas/Food Trucks and Stalls/Bakeries/Etc**  
From my understanding and experience, the positions here are paid appropriately. Starbucks starting pay averages 15-17/hr. that's about the same as my experience with other cafes. Cooks in my area start at 18-20/hr.  
That's about as much as my local supermarket pays for deli counter/cashiers/bakers/produce positions. Are we tipping them too? What is the distinction that has one group flipping their ipad around to ""just ask a few questions""?  
What's the reason I'm being asked to tip on a cup of coffee? Is this poured out of a vat with more skill and talent than the next place? Doesn't the cost of the coffee itself contain the service and convenience cost of me not making it myself at home?  
For those that own and operate food trucks, didn't you set the price for this \[food\]? Can't you just charge more if you think you're making it better than the next truck?

**DoorDash/Instacart/Deliveries**  
I'll admit to a fair portion of ignorance with these positions, but from a quick search, I see that DoorDash has an Earn by Time minimum, and Instacart has batch pay for their drivers.  
Can I get some insight on this? Why is tipping the societal expectation for these?  
For customers, a service fee or membership cost is paid for this service. What is the variation of deliveries made here? How could one do a better job of delivering a product than a UPS driver? For those doordashing, are you also tipping your Amazon package delivery drivers as well? Is that the norm?  
Aren't these jobs paying a rate that is reflective of the skill, education, and demand of performing these tasks? If it's not worth it, why not do something else instead of putting the burden of pay on the customers?  
I see a lot of grief posts about people not tipping on deliveries. Is there value to the perspective that the customer has already paid a delivery fee for the convenience? Why is tipping part of the question?

I still tip on all these services, I just don't know the why.

I didn’t sleep last night. Or the night before. Or maybe I did, and just can’t tell anymore.

My phone buzzes again, lighting up my dark room in a soft blue glow. I sat on my couch, lights off, coffee cold, staring at the wall until I realized the clock wasn’t ticking again.

2:14 a.m.  
2:14 a.m.  
2:14 a.m.

It never changed.

And then the first notification came through.

**\[!@#??→sleep now\]**

And soon came even more. Spam after spam.

**\[!@#?:→sleep now\]**

**\[!@#?/→sleep now\]**

**\[!@#1!→sleep now\]**

**\[SLEEP. YOU HAVE WORK IN THE MORNING.\]**

I stared at my phone screen. It was shaking slightly in my hands.  
There wasn’t even a number attached, just symbols.  
Not even ones I could type. It wasn’t English, or any language I recognized. Just… shapes. Like alien runes.

I turned my phone off.

A second later, it buzzed again.

**\[§§001001\] → Sleep. You have work in the morning.**

My chest tightened.

*“What the fuck,”* I whispered.

I powered my phone off again, this time removing the battery just to be sure.  
But then my laptop pinged from across the room.  
Same sound. Same message, glowing on the screen.

**You have work in the morning. Sleep.**

I slammed it shut, but the words still burned in my mind, echoing in rhythm with the hum I could feel pressing against my temples.

**Sleep**  
**Sleep**  
**Sleep**

I clutched my head, muttering to myself. *“Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.”*

Because if I slept, I didn’t think I’d wake up again. Not here. Not anywhere.

By 3 a.m., I’d unplugged everything in my apartment, my router, my TV, my microwave, even my clock.  
Didn’t matter. The words kept coming. Every reflective surface, my phone, my window, the blank screen of my laptop, flickered faintly, showing the same phrase, sometimes scrambled, sometimes perfectly clear:

**WAKE UP**

**SLEEP**

**RESET**

The contradiction made my skin crawl. Which was it? Was I supposed to sleep, or wake up?

I tried to think rationally, but it was like my thoughts weren’t my own anymore. Like something was inside my head, tugging at the strings, trying to push me toward something I couldn’t see.

Then, a knock.

A single, gentle *tap-tap-tap*.

I froze.

The knocks came again, louder this time.

I swallow hard and whispered, *“Who’s there?”*

A pause. Then a voice I recognize.

*“Hey… it’s me.”*

My sister.

For a moment, relief washes through me, but something about the timing, about her being here, this late, claws at my nerves.

I pull open the door. She’s standing there, smiling, like she’s been waiting for me. Her eyes look brighter than usual. Too bright.

*“Hey, sleepyhead,”* she says lightly. *“You look awful.”*

I blink at her. “How, how did you know I wasn’t sleeping?”

""What're you doing he-""

She tilts her head. *“You texted me. Remember?”*

*“No, I didn’t.”*

She frowns. *“Yes, you did. You said you weren’t feeling well and you wanted me to come check on you.”*

My throat tightens. *“No, I didn’t send anything.”*

She just smiles again, like I’m being silly. *“You’re probably just exhausted.”*

I step back and let her in. She moves easily, like she’s been here a hundred times before, even though I haven’t seen her in weeks. She goes straight to the kitchen, fills the kettle, and sets it on the stove.

*“You still drink chamomile, right?”* she asks without looking at me.

I hesitate. *“How did you know I was out?”*

She laughs softly. *“You always run out. You never restock.”*

I sit down, trying to steady my breathing. The walls hum again, faintly, like the air vents are singing. My sister hums along to some tune I don’t recognize.

*“Something’s been happening,”* I finally say. *“I’ve been getting these messages. They tell me to sleep. They’re from these, these weird numbers that aren’t even numbers. And my days… I don’t know if they’re even real anymore.”*

She stirs the tea slowly, too slowly.

*“Maybe it’s just stress,”* she says, still smiling. *“You’ve been overworked.”*

*“No, it’s not stress,*” I snap. *“I’m serious. I think, I think something’s wrong. Everyone’s been acting strange. Even you. You’re acting strange right now*.”

She sets down the spoon and turns toward me. Her smile doesn’t fade. Her eyes don’t blink.

*“What do you mean, strange?”*

I lean forward, whispering. *“Like you’re reading from a script.”*

For the first time, she falters, just a flicker, before the smile returns. *“It’s all in your head,”* she says softly. *“You need to rest.”*

The words hit like a jolt.

I push back from the table. *“Who told you to say that?”*

She tilts her head, the same unnatural motion again. *“You should rest,”* she repeats.

I take a step toward her, my voice shaking. *“You’re not listening. You don’t even care what I’m saying.”*

Her eyes lock on mine, wide, glassy, almost lifeless.

*“I care,”* she says in a perfect, even tone. *“Because that’s what I’m supposed to do.”*

The kettle starts to whistle.

Neither of us move.

Something in my chest twists, tightens, and for the first time I notice it: the faint hum in the air syncing perfectly with the kettle’s scream. The pitch rises and rises until I can’t tell which is which.

Then..

*click.*

The sound stops.

My sister lifts the kettle calmly, pours the water into two cups, and hands one to me.

*“Drink this,”* she says. *“You’ll feel better in the morning.”*

I stare into the tea. The steam curls up in perfect, looping patterns, too perfect. Every swirl identical to the last.

I whisper, *“When was the last time it rained?”*

She doesn’t answer.

*“When did we last go to a concert?”*

Nothing. Just that smile.

*“When was the last time you slept?”*

Finally, her eyes twitch, a single, subtle glitch in her expression.

Then she says, softly: *“You’re tired, Daniel. You just need to close your eyes.”*

I set the empty cup down. The air feels colder now.

I start to wonder if maybe I’m not supposed to wake up at all.

*The Invitation.*

The post came in the afternoon: a bundle of political circulars and subscription fliers, and one curious envelope the color of bone. No return address. 

A gold seal pressed in the wax showed two wings spread inside a triangle. It had the sort of symmetry one finds in the blueprints of the new modernists, neither abstract nor realistic, simply exact.

Inside was a letter written in a precise, meticulous hand. The paper was heavier than common stock, faintly perfumed with something metallic, like freshly minted coins or struck brass.

*To the Recipient Rowen McCalley,*

*You are hereby invited to document, as journalist and witness, the opening of my private estate in the northern forests of the Adirondack Mountains of New York.* 

*Your stay shall begin Friday morning and conclude Sunday evening. All provisions have been prepared. You will be housed in comfort and permitted full access to the grounds, provided you observe the itinerary enclosed within the main hall.*

*Yours in Art and Order,*  
*- A. D.*

The “A.D.” could only be one man.

Auguste Delaurier.

He was once the sovereign king of the Art Deco world. His facades rose like temples across New York and Chicago. He had designed the grand atrium of the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange, the Ecliptic Theatre in Chicago, and half the civic buildings between Albany and Montreal. 

Then he vanished in 1920, leaving behind no statement, no scandal and no grave.

For a decade he has been a myth, half genius, half lunatic.

And now, ten years to the month since his disappearance, a letter arrives inviting me, of all men, to document his resurrection.

I read the letter thrice before folding it again, torn on its authenticity. I had half a mind to toss it into the stove and be done with it. But this is the kind of story that wins a man an entire column. Or better yet, the kind that writes his whole career for him.

That evening I took dinner with Mercer and Denton at the press club. They made short work of their whiskey before I told them what I’d received.

Mercer leaned back and tapped his empty glass. “You’re serious? The old ghost himself is calling you up into the pines?”

“That’s what it says.”

“He’s dead,” Denton said flatly. “Everybody knows that. It's just a debate on how. Some say suicide. Some say he drowned in Paris. But they all agree he's gone and buried. Why the hell would you go and waste your time to see this fraud?”

“Because I was invited,” I told him. “And because, as far as I'm aware, there's no grave bearing the name Auguste Delaurier.”

Mercer grinned across the table. “You think he’s alive and well, waiting up there in his marble palace just for you? You know what,  maybe you're right. Maybe the man just wants some company from the post's most austere columnist.”

“Or he just wants someone to tell the world he’s still worth remembering,” I said. “Men like that don’t vanish forever. They only retreat for a time until the applause grows quiet enough to miss hearing. He has a legacy to maintain, afterall.”

Denton wiped the corner of his mouth with a napkin and frowned. “But honestly Rowen, If he’s been gone ten years, what makes you think the letter’s legitimate? Could’ve been posted by anyone. Hell, could’ve been written by a loon from Pennhurst.”

I shrugged. “Then I’ll find out. Three days won’t kill me.”

He muttered, “I’ll remember that for the headline when you go missing.”

Mercer raised his glass. “To the fool with a death wish.”

“To the fool with a story,” I said.

That earned a laugh.

We parted near midnight. I walked home through the cold, thinking how the city’s newest towers gleamed like steel fingertips under the moonlight; bright, proud, and lifeless.

If Delaurier truly built his own world in the woods, I mean to see it with my own eyes.



**Friday, October 24th, 1930**

*En Route to the Estate.*



The train pulled from the Albany depot near noon. The whistle bleeding through fog that hung over the river like smoke from a dying fire. 

I carried one suitcase, a field coat, a leather notebook, and a brass fountain pen. Everything else stayed behind. A story travels best when the load is small.

The journey north carried me through towns that grew smaller and stranger with each stop. Plaster gave way to timber, timber to sheet-metal roofs. 

Near the end of the line we stopped at Montclair. I stepped down for coffee while the conductor worked the freight. The diner crouched by the tracks, windows filmed with both the steam and the grease of the griddle.

The man behind the counter was old and narrow, with a face weathered to match the road outside. “Cold one for travel,” he said as I eased my coat over the back of the stool.

 “Suppose it is,” I replied. “Heading up toward Lawborough near Saranac. Delaurier Manor. You know the road?”

He stopped wiping the counter. “You mean the stone house up there near the Black Fork trails?”

 “I’d imagine that’s the one.”

He cut a look at the window; though there was nothing to see but mist and the trees. “Ain’t much up there. Nothing worth seeing anyway. I wouldn’t go if I were you.”

“Is there something wrong with it?”

“That house hasn’t had a guest in years. I’d figure that's for good reason. It took them near seven years and a dozen crews to build that place, and not one of those crew members came back the same.”

“That’s quite the declaration,” I said. “Do you have any sources for that claim?”

He shrugged. “I suppose they’re just stories. Lumbermen and masons see strange things when they sit on a project too long. A few of them happened to pass by and share a tale or two.”

“Auguste has a proclivity for flair. For a man like him, encouraging a few tales to frighten some workmen seems more than plausible,” I said.

He nodded once, then muttered, “Maybe. But I have yet to see a servant or laborer come down that path in the last 3 years. It doesn't give me a good feeling to think on why. Even an eccentric man needs a few groceries from time to time.”

A waitress set down my coffee. She looked no older than twenty and had a ring hung from a string at her throat. “Are you planning on staying up there, mister?”

 “Just for three days,” I answered.

Her eyes moved toward the black surface of the mug that lay in front of me. “I’d keep the lamps lit with oil if I were you. Electricity around here tends to-”

The bell over the door rang. A logger came in and beat mud from his boots. The thought died. Talk turned to weather and wages and I finished my cup.

I thanked the old man and stepped back into the autumn air.

By noon I had transferred to a hired motorcar. The driver was a thin fellow with grease on his cuffs and a pipe clamped between his teeth. 

We rode in silence for miles, the forest deepening around us until the road itself became rough patches of limestone and dirt. He kept his hands tight on the wheel.

“Strange place for an estate,” I remarked.

He held the pipe stem aside and said, “Yes sir. Stranger still for a man to live in it alone. Besides for his staff, of course.”

“You’ve been up there?”

“Close enough to see the gate a few years back. Didn’t like the way it looked. The whole forest leans towards it. It's a strange thing.”

We fell quiet again. The sky turned the color of lead. Rain flirted with the windshield, sweet and earthy in the air. 

I jotted a few quick notes in my lap: *Landscape austere. Atmosphere anticipatory. Something ahead.*

As the miles lengthened, I felt a change. Not in the car or the weather, but in the depth between the trees. The woods seemed to draw inward, the branches closing like a caged thing. 

When the driver finally breaked, I saw the start of a private lane vanishing into black spruce ahead.

“This is where I leave you. The lane goes on for maybe another mile. You’ll see the gate when you reach the manor.”

I stepped out, the frost biting through my gloves. “You’re not coming up?”

He laughed. “I’d rather not.”

I paid him. He had the car turned before I’d finished gathering my things from the forest floor, the wheels hissing away on the wet leaves. I watched the taillights fade into the mist until they looked like two dying lanterns.

Then I faced the path ahead. 

The lane was sparse and tight, choked with needles and half-swallowed by soil. The air had the crisp taste of iron and lightning. I felt an energy carry in the wind I could not pinpoint.

I set my collar, opened my notebook, and wrote the first true words of my record:

*‘The road to Delaurier Manor begins where the world decides it does not wish to be followed.’*

I walked on.


**Friday, October 24th, 1930**

*The Arrival.*


The lane narrowed until it felt like a chute hewn from leaves and stone. Black spruces stood with arms locked. Their tops swayed as if they spoke to one another in a tongue made of a bitter breeze. 

I walked counting my steps and keeping the time by marking the small pains in my feet. 

When I broke from the trees I met a wall of masonry that rose like a frozen cliff. Set into it stood a gate. At its forefront stood a simple crest. Two wings inside a triangle. The same symbol that had sealed my invitation. 

I thought to myself, ‘So you do exist, Mr. Delaurier.’

The stature of the gateway was a ladder for the eye. Its scale was far more than just imposing. It ventured into domineering.  

Along the ironwork’s inner band a faint text had been chiseled into the metal, the letters so shallow they hid until the overhead light struck them:

*Hush, draw the curtain; set the lights; let moths attend.*

*A masque begins where midnight prays, and actors bow and bend.*

‘Curious,’ I thought.

Sunburst reliefs crowned the top of the arch, their rays struck into metal as if the very sunlight had been casted and hammered there. 

I peered through the bars. Beyond lay a forecourt of pale gravel. The manor held the far side of the clearing in a single great face, clean and severe. The term sprawling felt diminutive to its true nature.

And yet, as I watched, I observed no smoke from any chimney nor birds on the parapets. 

I stood with my suitcase and said aloud, “All right, grand Architect. I have arrived.”

The gate did not answer. It did, however, stand unlocked, as if to say that trespass was only ever a matter of effort and will. 

I pushed the latch open and said, because the silence made me theatrical, “Of course, only at your beckoning, sir.”

The gate's hinges screeched their welcome behind me as the gate closed. I crossed the courtyard and took stock. 

The exterior of the estate bore stacked levels and sharp recesses where a traditional house would have offered bays and porches. 

Corners of every side cut inward and upward, then flared out with a rigid grace. Windows ran in disciplined bands across the entirety of its face while repeating engravings of triangles ran the length of the roofline. 

There were statues in the courtyard, not of saints or kings, but figures abstracted into clean effigy's. They had no faces, only curved and polished masks. One lifted a disk. Another held a spear.

“It seems you’ve forgotten to give them mouths, my dear friend. There’s no one to sing with me.”

But that wasn’t true. The grounds did sing along in its own way. The gravel sounded a hymn underfoot and my own pulse kept percussion with it. 

‘If the Earth has a throne,’ I noted, ‘it is not cushioned. It must certainly be like this. Made up entirely of right angles.’

At the foot of the main steps a single sheet of paper had been fixed to the door. The edges had curled and feathered. Rain had kissed it often though the ink remained legible. 

The heading read: *Itinerary and House Rules for Mr. McCalley.*

“Let us see your law,” I said.

I read the whole of it with care. The directives were set in numbered lines with no ornament.

1. Enter alone.
2. Remain within marked paths.
3. Keep to scheduled events.
4. Do not attempt to meet staff.
5. Do not deviate from times.

“Enter alone,” I repeated. “I suppose we have begun well at least.”

I continued down to the itinerary.

The schedule was written below the rules in hour blocks, Friday through Sunday. The first event was a gramophone lecture marked for this early evening. Meanwhile the final item for Sunday bore one word only. 

‘Stay.’

I said, “Very well. I will keep to your demands, Auguste, if only to see where it leads.” 

I pressed the iron latch. 

The door yielded.


**Friday, October 24th, 1930**

*The Entryway.*


I crossed the threshold and stood in the vestibule hall. 

The air held a mineral scent, the kind that lingers over a quarry after rain. Floor tiles formed a radiating script that steered my attention to the far wall, where a colossal bronze sunburst presided above the inner door.

At the base of the nearest ray a bronze plate lay etched with another stanza:

*From cratered courts the rebel hosts uprear their glittering plan,*

*A city hewn from smoking dreams to crown disbelief of man.*

I let the words settle and took stock of the room again. There were no rugs. No umbrella stand. No scatter of boots. 

The place held the undisturbed neatness of a stage set before the curtain call.

I raised my sight above and witnessed grand statues from the rooftop peering down at me through the atrium's glass ceiling. They appeared to stand in judgement of the guests who arrived at the threshold.

Off to my left, a clock made itself known.

I broke my attention away from the faceless giants overhead and fixed on the dial. I listened past that steady metronome and hunted for any other life in the marble runs.

After some time it became clear that there would be no clatter of servants. No drift of talk. My company, it would seem, would remain to be only the machinery of the manor. 

I must admit, the hush went to work at the base of my skull in the same way worms work a wet patch of sod. It moved with an appetite.

I faced the sunburst once more. A pedestal waited near the door, a waist-high granite block with a copper plate in front. Upon it rested a gramophone of black finish and muscular lines, its horn flared like a night-blooming flower. The crank lay at the side. A single record rested on the plate. 

Beside that, a leaflet lay pinned beneath a small silver weight shaped as a wing.

I laid my suitcase by the wall and read the notice. A simple neat line: 

*Orientation to commence at five o’clock. Stand under the eyes of this atrium and play this record. Attend the welcoming.*

My watch read four fifty-six. 

If this was to be theatre, I would not miss my cue. 

I worked warmth back into my fingers and paced the vestibule to test the echo of my bootfalls. Of which there were many. Yet each returned with a lag, as if the room’s corners ate a fraction of each step.  

Then my companion rang. Its echo outdid my boots. 

Five had arrived.

I stepped onto the bronze crescent before the gramophone. The horn waited, flower open, black mouth turned to the room. I wound the handle and lowered the needle.

The gramophone answered with a deep belt-driven purr. A hairline hiss rose from the record. Then a man’s measured tenor filled the atrium, clipped and punctual, as if each word had been drawn with a gold ruler.

“Welcome, Mr. Rowen. I trust your trip served you well.

“You stand in the vestibule of the Delaurier estate. My home. The threshold where function governs form. 

“Now, before we begin, know this: the estate is prepared for your comfort. Your chamber is set, your supper arranged, your route marked. 

“You will not need to summon anyone. Those who serve will move where they belong and will not intrude. In kind, do not intrude upon them. I mean to give you a story fit for print, so others may bear witness to my creation.

“In order for that to happen, I must ask you to attend to what is before you and not to what is behind you. You will wish to look over your shoulder at times. I ask that you resist that temptation. The house prefers your attention forward, as do I.

“In the meantime, take a moment to look around and enjoy the artistry of my work. I will walk you through this palace starting here.

“You will see that this vestibule is laid in bands of travertine and Belgian black, alternating to train the eye forward. Stand upon the inner crescent. Feel the stones settle your stance.”

I walked to the inner circle and allowed the room's presence to close in. There was a strange weight to the air. Like a charge and a shock.

“Note the bronze sunburst above the inner door. Its rays are not ornament. They are vectors. They tell you where to walk, how to hold your frame, how to breathe. 

“If you lose your bearings at any point in your stay, return to a sunburst and take instruction from its lines. Should that fail you, look upon the baseboards. You will find narrow inlays of dark stone. These are also guide marks. 

“Let the room command you. Resist nothing from it.”

The horn tremored a little with the deeper vowels. I could feel it through my shoes.

“Now lift your head and consider the dimensions. The ceiling steps upward in three separate planes. Each step is a diminuendo of order.”

I raised my focus. There were indeed three tiers that met me. The echoes of the recording climbed in triplicate and gathered at the feet of the figures on the roof.

I studied their empty visages while the record gave off its warm crackle. It almost felt wrong when the architect's voice returned.

“You will have no doubt marked those statues above you. But you must understand that they are not mere men. They are ideas given limb and crown. Do not ascribe them faces. A face weakens an idea.”

I felt as though more faces had joined the congregation above the glass. A sense of vertigo set over me at the mere scale.

“Your first hour will be simple. You may now proceed to the dining hall. Do not hurry. Your place has been set to your measure. There is a plate prepared for you. It will be hot and fresh. You will find the arrangement correct and to your liking.

“Afterwards, you will visit the bathhouse to the east and clean yourself. Fresh towels await you on the bench. Your robe hangs within your chamber, which you will reach by following the eastward guide marks when you return.”

I took up my suitcase and put a foot on the first tile beyond the crescent.

“Mind yourself,” the record said, curiously in time with my steps. “You will feel alone. That is acceptable. The house approves of that feeling.”

A hot draft moved across my ankles. 

“Ascend.” 

A final ripple, almost like a chuckle laid beneath the static, then a release. The machine fell still.

I went on as directed. Sixty feet from the atrium’s heart brought me to the stair. The bronze rail bit the palm with a friction as I climbed.

Somewhere at my back a footfall followed me from the bottom of the staircase.

I did not turn to see what had made it.


**Friday, October 24th, 1930**

*The Dining Room and Bathhouse.*


The corridor to the dining room ran close and spare. 

At the end of its run it opened all at once into a broad chamber. A lacquered table stood there, linen bare of crumbs, place set for one. I checked my watch. On the dot of six, a service door eased inward somewhere out of sight. I turned toward the sound and waited. No figure came.

When I faced the table again, steam braided up from a covered dish that had not been there an instant earlier. I raised the lid. Inside lay trout, glossed with butter and salt. Beside it, a heel of fresh bread and a cup of coffee that carried the same fragrance of the freight-station brew.

I raised my chin and let the mystery server have their praise. “This looks exceptional. Thank you, my friend.” No reply came. Only the chandelier gave a faint sway, as if something had skimmed across it on its way out.

I ate. Each bite tasted as if it had been made a minute ago and no earlier. Its taste was immaculate. The seasoning knew its place.

The chair furthest from me creaked once, as if a knee set against it in anticipation. I kept to my place and finished. I folded the napkin. The plate sat bare. I turned toward the service corners. Only a closed door met me. I weighed whether to wash the dish myself.

When I faced the table again, the plate had vanished.

“You are clever, whoever you are.” I said, and let out a curt laugh. I waited for a retreating tread.  There was none. Only the sound of wood settling and a pipe carting its contents off through the walls.

I told my notebook that only an exceptional staff could perform to the minute like this. 

Then I told my mind they must use a trick of doors and serving apertures to keep from being seen. 

Most of all, I told my thoughts to keep close to center and not to let fear take me. 

I had been provided an exact itinerary for a reason. I was in an orchestral play requiring precise timing. The actors clearly did not want to be seen and spoil the production. I would not rob them of that.

The next cue sent me to the bathhouse.

I stood and left the dining room. I followed the marked path that led to the eastern wing. What opened ahead earned its own line in my future article.

A covered way took me in. Glass panes formed a long throat of light, a kaleidoscope of late sun moving over the floor. Somewhere in the machinery of the place a fan turned on. I could feel the warm air draw across my skin as if the house blew a sweet breath upon me.

At the end of the walkway stood the baths. The room presented itself as a gallery of chrome.

Towels lay rolled in pairs with their edges aligned. Soap scored with the letters A and D lay on a dish by the tap. The tub ran the length of the room like a trough in a temple. Heat bulged from the water's surface with a white thread of vapor.

I touched the surface with a finger and pulled back at once. Another man had judged the heat for me, and his scale ran high. The water was near scorching to my skin.

“All right, old man. You mean for me to be comfortable, and I must say food was quite remarkable, but you severely misjudged the heat a man’s body can take. This water is near boiling.”

The room echoed my remark two beats late, as if a second bather had repeated them from the far end of the tub. 

I surveyed the shining run of the tub and set my coat on the bench. It took me some time, but I cleaned myself proper. 

I dried myself with the towel that had been set for me. 

The mirror above the counter showed a man's face resembling my own through the steam. Though that man looked further aged and tired than I had last seen. I tested my reflection and raised a brow. The image matched, which settled the matter. It confirmed the tired looking man was indeed me.

At the edge of the silver backing of the glass lay an inscription:

*The conqueror that eats all pageants had paid the house a courteous visit.*


**Friday, October 24th, 1930**

*The Bedchambers.*


When I stepped back into the covered way the light had shifted toward late evening. The house grew larger in the half-dark, its reach extended by the lack of visible ends. A trace of machine oil came through the vents from the generator below.

The itinerary called for an early retirement. I could not argue with that. Fatigue had settled on me like a commanding hand to the back of the neck.

A door marked *Quarters* stood at the far end of the passageway. Beyond it ran a wing of rooms.

My name was printed on a small card near the frame of one of the doors. When I pressed my hand to the knob, the mechanism clicked once with a dry, satisfied sound. The hinges swung inward without complaint.

I found the bedchamber prepared with the same meticulous precision that marked every room before it. The coverlet drawn flat as a sheet of paper, two glasses on the nightstand filled to identical measure, one of water, one of milk. 

I smiled at the childish touch and spoke aloud, “You have a keen sense for hospitality, old builder.”

A wardrobe door stood open and within hung a robe that was of exquisite quality. Heavy weave. Red with a faint gray and black gleam along the lapels. I ran a hand along the sleeve. Warm and velvet.

I had left the bedroom door open behind me. I was not keen to seal myself into any room in this place. Yet the latch drew itself shut with a clean, polite click. 

I tried the handle. No give. “Well,” I said, half a snort, “so much for free will. I suppose that ended at the gate.”

I set an ear to the panel. Nothing. I tried the knob again with more force. Still nothing. I wanted a better look at my captor.

I struck a match and lit the bedside lamp. The flame sparked. It was enough to show that the lock on the door was a simple contraption, nothing more than a bolt worked from the outside. 

*‘A trick of the staff,’* I reasoned. *‘They mean to keep me from wandering the halls at night and discovering their little machinations.’*

I decided to get comfortable for the night. I poured the water into the washbowl, stripped down into the dressing gown, and set to making my notes. The power source below sent a steady hum through the floorboards. A deep, rolling draw and release like a beast at rest.

At precisely nine, the hum changed pitch. I lifted my head and listened. The sound grew taut, as if the power were being choked away. The corridor light outside the chambers went dark.

I crossed to the window and raised the blind. 

More lights died. 

Each going in perfect order across the estate. From my window I could trace the progress in rows, moving east to west, each room blacking out as if some unseen crew moved wing to wing extinguishing lamps by a rule of measure.

“Who winds you down, house?” I said to the glass.

Not a single shadow crossed any windowpane.

When the last glow faded from the clerestory over the service wing, the generator gave one last groan and eased.

The gravel court below turned to a blank field. No moon. No star. The manor held like the husk of a colossal shell. I set my palm to the glass. 

For a moment I thought I saw a flicker along the far wing, a movement behind one of the blackened panes, but when I leaned closer it proved only my reflection.

I checked my watch. Nine thirty. 

In my last minutes awake I wrote:

*Lights extinguished in perfect sequence. No staff seen. Possible mechanical control. This house sleeps with its guests.*


**Saturday, October 25th, 1930**

*The North Loggia.*


Dawn came with a click at the latch. The door stood free. I dressed, packed the notebook, and set my mind to the day’s work.

I stepped into the corridor. A gramophone waited on a rolling cart. A typed card sat under a silver clip: *Please play upon waking.* 

“All right. Let's hear it.” I wound the handle and lowered the needle. The belt took hold, and the same measured tenor from orientation carried down the hall.

“Good morning, Mr. McCalley. Follow the diagonal markers set into the baseboards to your next stop. Do not stray. When the lines meet, you will be where I need you to be.”

I lowered my focus. Dark inlays ran the length of the skirting, converging like rivers toward a single point. I set the cart in motion along their guidance, nodded to no one, and walked with my eyes set on the stones.

“Lift your head,” the record carried. “You are capable of dividing your attention. Let your direction be instructed by the manor. The line under your feet is forgiving to anyone who is capable of listening.”

“I suppose I could use that forgiveness,” I said in jest.

“You and the rest of our species,” the record answered, as if he had heard me through the horn.

The corridor widened into the north loggia, a long gallery of columns and windows that set the grounds in a frame. The cart could go no farther. A second gramophone waited on a marble plinth by the first column in the gallery. I crossed to it and set its needle down.

“Do you see it?” the record asked me. “Stand at the seam where the floor patterns meet. From there turn toward the panel with the small brass latch.”

I found the seam. The floor showed two mosaics pressed edge to edge, each pulling the eye in contrary directions until they resolved to a single band. A brass latch waited in the wall at chest height.

I flipped the mechanism.

A concealed panel slid back to show a shallow bay filled with bakelite levers. Warm air fluttered the fine dust within.

“A switchboard,” the record intoned. “A house is a machine. A machine must be spoken to. Each lever is a word. Say the right word and the house moves as you command it.”

I leaned closer. 

This so-called ‘board’ was not merely wires and screws. Copper paths ran in narrow veins that bent and looped with a purpose I could not parse. Curved cables interlaced with tiny crossings, then sudden angles that met and parted like fish at a weir.

Between the traces tiny marks repeated and grew, a grammar of hooks and circles, strokes that crossed at angles not used in any alphabet I knew. The paths knotted at black studs, then unwound to a comb of steel teeth that vanished into the wall.

The intricacy of this system of circuits superseded any article I had ever read on the matter. The schematics very nearly came across as drawings rather than advanced engineering.

I narrowed my focus and tried to follow a single strand from stud to tooth. It led me into a wire figure that was neither star nor wheel, but some union of both. The longer I looked, the more it felt as if something looked back at me through the copper.

“Do you employ a man to speak for you, or do you personally skulk this house flipping its switches, Mr. Delaurier?” I asked the room.

The gallery answered with a single click somewhere above. A soft thrum heaved and strained from the walls. The glass beads on the switchboard winked at me with a red light. 

The gramophone continued. “Leave the circuits as you found them and proceed to the northern stairs to make your descent. Do not take the lift. Our next venture will be outside.”

A shadow shifted at the end of the loggia and a lift door parted of its own accord. The car waited with its gate open, empty as a mouth that expected food. Its cage lights flickered in a rhythm that matched the lights of the board.

“I said the stairs,” Delaurier’s recorded tenor repeated. “The lift is for the others.”

The gate slid shut again without a hand. The car sank. 

I found the stairs and began to descend. At the first landing, I paused.

A handrail ran along the wall. When I set my skin upon it, the metal held a trace of heat as if a palm had just left it.

“Is someone working up here with me?” I called. “I would like it if you showed yourself.”

Somewhere within the wall a long muscle of piping gave a satisfied groan.


**Saturday, October 25th, 1930**

*The Grounds.*


I left by the northern gallery and stepped into the grounds.

A gramophone waited in a weather hood, a birdhouse with a black tulip for a beak. I wound the crank. The belt steadied. The even tenor came bright and sure.

“Attend the skin of my creation. Pores, ducts, gutters, valves. Observe the reflecting pool and the channel that feeds it. You will find no waste here. Only transit…”

I took the flagged walk along the basin. The pool carried the manor on its face and broke only when a gust passed against it like a patient knife. Beneath the rim, small slots drank the overflow at each pass of a wave.

The hooded horn addressed me again from its post.

“…After all, hydrology is discipline. Old Rome did not conquer with sword alone. Pipes do as much as spears.” The voice cracked and died.

At the far end, a second hooded gramophone stood beside a square pumphouse of poured walls and a steel door. The record resumed when I wound the next handle.

“You are at the pump,” it announced. “Beneath you the veins take rain, melt, and groundwater, and move it across the estate. What you will hear is perfectly balanced throughput. The water you bath in, the water you drink, all purified through the bowels of this house.”

I opened the pumphouse door and surveyed the room. The interior contained multitudes of gauges blinking with endless needles. Pipes ran their way down into the ground. 

I stepped out to look beneath the foundation where a stone culvert ought to spill. The streambed was dry. White pebbles lined the channel like a rinsed throat left without water. Yet the path gutters at my feet clicked with a scatter of drops.

*Tick, tick, tick.*

“Where do you steal this water from?” I asked the soil.

The gravel offered no answer beyond a small complaint under my foot.

“Now, stand at the next marker stone. The sculpture court awaits.”

I stepped forward. The path carried beyond the eastern wing, down a flagstone staircase and across a shallow terrace where warmth rose again from unseen vents. The woods ringed the property at a respectful distance.

I followed the markers set into the paving until I reached a brass plaque that read simply: *Court of Figures*.

Another gramophone waited beneath an overhang.

“Here the house reveals what it dreams of when it sleeps. Each shape was drawn from the image that kept me awake the longest.”

I walked the court while he spoke.

In the center stood twelve statues, each caught between poise and torment. Their bodies were built of brass, onyx, and some darker alloy that refused to gleam even under the noon light. Each one caught in an attitude of movement, yet none appeared to move in the same direction nor toward the same end.

Some reached skyward with stretched limbs, others bent as if burdened by an invisible weight. Their faces were featureless masks drawn in long, perfect planes. The light touched their edges like a wound cauterized in gold. They rose at least twice the height of any man known in the world.

Delaurier’s voice continued. “When I first saw them in my mind, they were aflame. Not burning, but bright with knowledge. I have tried to shape that light here in hopes they may share such grand insights with those who view them.”

Wind swept through the court and gave the statues a faint groan, metal shifting on its base. I took a step nearer to one and saw that beneath the polish of its chest, the seams seemed to ripple, as if something moved under the skin of the metal, trying to make room for air.

“I have stood here many evenings,” said the recording. “The longer one looks, the more certain one becomes that they have not ceased their work… It is amusing, you know, that we call them sculptures because they do not move. But I counter that thought. Perhaps they only wait for a proper invitation.”

“And what invitation is that?”

A sound answered, not from the horn but from the court itself. A faint creak of settling bronze. The brush of grit where nothing had stepped.

When I turned, one of the figures had shifted. Only a fraction. Its chin tipped lower toward the paving, and the light bent differently across its cheek. I told myself it was heat, or the play of shadow. 

Even so, when I left I kept my back to the court of statues and did not look again until I reached the safety of the terrace.


**Saturday, October 25th, 1930**

*The Second Night’s Rest.*


The afternoon’s rounds ended at the gallery door, where a fresh card waited in the same tidy hand as the others: *Supper at seven.*

I took the corridor that kept the day’s last light and reached the dining room. The lacquered table waited. Chandeliers cupped their bulbs in white bowls of glass. The tablecloth lay stretched tight enough that it would sing if a coin ran across it.

Vapor rose from a covered plate at the head of the table. I raised the lid. Prime rib, sliced thick and red; a spoon of potatoes; a dark gravy with a harbor’s sheen. A cup of tea stood ready beside it.

I tried, once more, to catch the staff at work. “Friend,” I said, pitching my voice to the corners, “let me thank you in person. You've prepared another outstanding meal.”

Timber eased under a draft and offered nothing else back.

I ate at an easy pace. The dish held the same impossible freshness, as if the stove lived inside the table. When I lifted the napkin, a printed slip slid free: *Retire at eight*. 

I checked the watch. My bedchambers were already calling. I heeded the note and returned to the quarters that bore my name.

The chamber admitted me. This time the door did not wait before closing behind my back. The latch drew shut almost at once after I crossed the threshold. I tried the knob, knowing I would not like the result. As expected, no purchase.

“Very well,” I said. “We are to repeat the same experiment for a second night.”

I lit the lamp and set my notebook on the desk. I began writing about the day I had just experienced. The generator’s lament once more spoke through the floorboards as the lights around the manor began fading. The machine gave the steady animal murmur of a draft horse in harness. 

Then the pattern changed. A soft roll came along the hall. The faint scrape of a cart. It paused outside my door and came to perfect rest. 

A heartbeat later a gramophone woke with the belt’s small bite and the horn spoke. It was not with words but with a noise that had no business in a human corridor. 

What rose was a rehearsal of noises that a man does not care to name. Yet I must.

Voices gathered huddled together, not speaking any tongue I knew. Children at a schoolyard heard through a long pipe. A woman laughing until the sound broke. A man counting, but the numbers arrived out of order and then ran backward.

Each noise overlapping yet distinct. A mass of individuals clawing for their own attention. I set my forearm to the panel as if to brace the door.

“Enough,” I said, and meant it. “You have made your point.”

The horn replied by pulling everything down at once.

The pulse sank as if the floor had dropped away. Into that fall came a choir without words, mouths open, throats desert-dry. A chorus of mouth-sounds rose to the wet clack of lips trying on words that did not fit.

A scrape crossed the door, frantic and searching, as though the horn had grown a probed tip and a nail that sought an audience with me.

“Enough,” I said to the door, more plea than command. ”By all that is holy, I said enough.”

Static swelled, a chair creaked on the other side, the needle skated, then silence cut clean. The hall returned to old stone.

After some minutes I steadied my thinking. I set notes in order, trimmed the lamp, and lay atop the coverlet with my boots on.

I kept the lock in sight. The dark outside pressed its face to the pane. Somewhere a pipe clicked as it cooled.  I heard only the soft grind of the earth under the foundations.

The house had settled. 

I did not.

When I do though I need to it cool down substantially so I don’t burn myself, long after my family or friends have started drinking theirs.

Even eating food like stew or soup, sausages, mash etc my family will eat straight away and swear to me it’s not hot but alas I will burn my tongue.

I feel as though most people’s tongues gain immunity from heat to a point from frequent hot drinks like tea and coffee. Does anyone else have this situation?",8,1760127176.0,ask,10,1.0,False
