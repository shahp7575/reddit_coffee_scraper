I found out my husband was cheating on me, kept it to myself, and the day I had him served with divorce papers, I posted this on Facebook, where all our friends and family are..



Oh, honey, you thought I wouldn‚Äôt find out?

That‚Äôs adorable. Really. But here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äì your sneaky little side hobby, thinking you‚Äôre some undercover James Bond type, has finally been exposed. And unlike you, I have no intention of hiding in the shadows. So grab your popcorn, because this is going public.

Do you know how long I‚Äôve been ignoring the late nights, the ‚Äúwork trips,‚Äù the secretive texting? YEARS. That‚Äôs right. But oh, how sweet it was to discover that you, my dear husband, are about as subtle as a neon sign saying ‚ÄúSNEAKY CHEATER HERE!‚Äù

Let me take a moment to thank your ‚Äúsoulmate‚Äù (and I use that term generously) for leaving a trail of evidence that even a blind mole rat could follow. Between her very generous perfume on your shirt, the ‚Äúmisplaced‚Äù lipstick-stained coffee cup in your car, and the hotel receipts you oh-so-cleverly stuffed into MY glovebox? Sweetheart, you left enough clues to rival an Agatha Christie novel. And boy, I played detective.

So now, my darling husband, consider this my own little ‚Äúpublic service announcement.‚Äù I‚Äôm done with your ridiculous lies. I‚Äôm done waiting up and playing the supportive wife while you‚Äôre out here romancing someone who doesn‚Äôt even know how to button her blouse correctly.

And yes, I know you‚Äôll try to gaslight your way out of this. Maybe say I‚Äôm ‚Äúoverreacting‚Äù or ‚Äúparanoid‚Äù or ""taking things out of context."" Well, let me tell you, context went out the window along with my trust and patience.

So enjoy this, sweetheart, because it‚Äôs the last time I‚Äôll be giving you ANY of my time, attention, or dignity. I'll be just fine ‚Äì but you, on the other hand? Good luck convincing anyone else that you're even half the man you pretend to be.

Consider this Exhibit A in the glorious show of your own unraveling. And you know what? I might just bring popcorn for the whole town to watch.

Cheers, darling! üçæ

For some backstory, It‚Äôs been about 4 years since I‚Äôve dated. Partially because my last relationship ended in kind of a nightmare. I dated her for about 2 years in college and was extremely respectful when I broke it off with her but she made a big deal out of it in the end and turned many of my peers at school against me. I‚Äôve spent the last 4 years completely leveling up as I felt it was a bigger priority and where I moved after college the dating pool was almost nonexistent. Now I have moved back to my home town and downloaded tinder. I got a lot of matches which has never happened to me before. I seemed to have a good connection with common interests with one girl in particular so after a week and half or so of snap chatting we went out for coffee. It went well there were no red flags and we both had a good time. We met up again a few days later to go for a little nature walk in the woods which also went well and we got to talk and find out a lot more about each other. At the end of the date when I dropped her off we had a moment where she waited a second unsure if I was going to kiss her but it just felt a little unsure from us both so I decided to wait for a better time. We went on another date a few days later hiking the cliffs in Newport RI where I kissed her. we went out to lunch and walked around the town and had a little make out sesh while we watched the sunset. We were so focused on each other all day neither of us took a single picture despite the gorgeous day and views. We had continued snapchating casually throughout the day. It‚Äôs been about a week since the date since I had to travel to FL to visit family but the past day or two she seems to be less responsive. I asked her out this coming weekend and she said she will let me know. But she said that about our other date too so I wasn‚Äôt too concerned. But I‚Äôm anxious with her being less responsive in addition. The first 3 dates all happened kind of quickly just from our schedules but with her being less responsive I don‚Äôt know how I should handle it. Should I bring it up? Or Snapchat her less to make her miss me? 

I also want to clarify when I say less responsive I mean she has been leaving larger gaps between responding and hasn‚Äôt seemed as engaged with asking questions and left me on open. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being overly clingy but I don‚Äôt use Snapchat very much either so I might not know the standard practices",1,1731470414.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been learning German on my own for a while. I love it, like if it is possible to be in love with a language, that‚Äôs how I feel about it. 

That said. i‚Äôve never had anybody to practice with. I can read at a high level and follow conversation well, but when it comes to speaking I become a babbling mess. 
The other day I received an invite to a coffee shop meetup to practice- the exact thing i‚Äôve been waiting for. I take my ritalin, I take my propranolol, I‚Äôm ready to go and speak confidently. and for a bit I did. 

But towards the end, I felt my meds wearing off and my mind unfocusing, partially from social fatigue. 
I started struggling to remember words. I couldn‚Äôt make eye contact. I would try but it would fail and I‚Äòd start panicking. I started going on and on about my study habits because it‚Äôs something i‚Äôm proud of. By now it was just me and one other person, and I worry I was off-putting with my excessive talking, fidgeting, and sudden inability to maintain eye contact. 

How do you deal with the constant anxiety over how you conduct yourself in public? I overthink everything all the time and convince myself I came off in the worst ways possible. I worry so much about making someone uncomfortable by accident- I don‚Äôt ever want to be off-putting for anyone. 
I feel sick with myself. I shouldn‚Äôt but I do. 

I want to be able to function without meds, but unless i‚Äôm talking about studying German, or my job, I can barely speak without freezing up. How do I just‚Ä¶ believe in myself? not question myself? ugh. ",1,1731470349.0,anxiety_support,1,1.0,False

It's one of the few natural dyes capable of yielding such bright red hues.

I‚Äôm at work, **chillin‚Äô like Bob Dylan**, and I made the **biggest mistake ever**. I forgot to bring **caffeine**. Yup.

I have course work to do, but when my one side of my brain decides it has to do something, the other side sabotages it and distracts it with things like **searching Amazon for expensive vitamins** (only 5‚Ä¶why are vitamins so expensive? **Excuse me for wanting to SURVIVE past 29**) but also there‚Äôs some concealer that looks intriguing (concealer is makeup, for those that didn‚Äôt know that)(what are you feelings about **opening a product and trying it but returning it knowing that Amazon will let you keep this type of product**? **I‚ÄôM NOT A BAD PERSON STOP JUDGING**).¬†

It‚Äôd be super cool if a couple of you reached out and was like hi and I was like heyyy and then we talked about things. **What should we talk about?**¬†

\-Feelings on **age gaps**?¬†

\-What flower best says I platonically love you and would **take a bullet for you** and **I‚Äôm sorry**?¬†

\-Pretend I could afford it and help me think of a **cool tattoo**? (Shout out to the Redditor who suggested Medusa and Aphrodite.)¬†

\-Worst response to **I Love You** besides Thank You?

\-I have a creative writing degree and I‚Äôm learning to copyedit but that takes time and I love poetry more than life itself so **what do you think I should do with my non-existent career**? Feel free to ask follow-up questions for a more accurate answer. (I don‚Äôt want to be a professor of english).¬†

We can talk about other stuff too! **The sky‚Äôs the limit**! Actually, you know what? **No it‚Äôs not because some of you are gonna use that as an excuse to ask what color underwear I‚Äôm wearing and that‚Äôs off the table‚Ä¶probably.** You never know with me at this point. I happily unravel a little more each day. **You guys think oh she‚Äôs crazy and I‚Äôm like no I‚Äôm CRAZY.** Some of you have you seen it‚Ä¶.**sorry about that**. The more caffeine I drink, the more unpredictable I get and let me tell you, I‚Äôm chugging this stuff. Ok I‚Äôm going to go now. Come see me and say hi!! (**That sounds a little dirty** lol)

My partner and I work at the same company. We‚Äôve been together for about nine months. My birthday was on October 20. On the evening of October 18, she called me and said her manager had called her, insisting that we both had to go to work the next day. It was a Saturday, and normally, we‚Äôre off on weekends. Even though I was tired and suggested she go alone, she somehow convinced me, and we set off for work on Saturday morning.

However, it turns out we weren‚Äôt going to work at all. :) Instead, we went to a beautiful spot on the side of a high mountain, two hours away from the city where we live, and had a lovely breakfast together. Everything was perfect. By noon, we had finished our breakfast, and she told me that we had no further plans, asking what I would like to do. I suggested visiting a nearby lake, which was about a 25-minute drive away.

We took romantic walks around the lake, drank coffee, and took lots of photos. Then she mentioned knowing another nice place nearby. So we set off for that spot, climbing further up the mountain. All around were only villas.

At one point, she said she really needed to use the restroom, stopped the car, and went to knock on the door of one of the houses. When the door opened, there were our friends waiting for me with a birthday cake in their hands. I was in shock and speechless. I had never experienced so many surprises in one day. I truly felt loved, and that day and the days following were perfect. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôll never forget.

However, last Sunday night, on November 10, I received a long message from my partner. She said she was feeling mentally unwell, experiencing a void within herself, that she didn‚Äôt want to keep hurting me or herself, and that she wanted to end the relationship.

I was stunned, as if struck by lightning. I couldn‚Äôt find a rational answer. She doesn‚Äôt want to talk, and I‚Äôve decided not to reach out for at least a few weeks.

Since my birthday, we hadn‚Äôt had any major arguments or disagreements. I still can‚Äôt make sense of what happened. Dear Reddit strangers, what do you think? Thank you.",1,1731470043.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1gq43sl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1gq43sl/question_about_australian_culture_etiquette_etc/,"Question About Australian Culture, Etiquette, etc. in Professional Settings, and Visiting Melbourne","Hi!

I will be going to Melbourne in a few days for the first time to exhibit at a trade show. I do have the common sense of always be respectful and considerate, but would like to know if there are certain **behaviors that are less obvious to a foreigner, but can seems rude to an Australian.**

Also, I would like to learn some things about your history and culture before I go. Things that if they ever come up in a conversation, having a bit of knowledge would make me seem a little more respectful to your culture than an average foreigner. **Please give me some topics that I should google and read up on a bit before my trip.**

**Any general tips** are much appreciated. What kind of compliments that are appropriate and welcomed in professional settings, things to avoid mentioning, etc.

Hopefully with your tips and advices, I can present the best of myself and leave a good impression at the exhibition. **Thanks in advance!**

**Additional questions that's off topic and specific to Melbourne residents:**

Since I'm posting, might as well ask in this sub, and hope I'm not breaking any rules. Any **good restaurant and bar recommendations** around the **Melbourne Convention & Exhibition Centre**? Just looking for dinner and bar to chill afterwards, as breakfast and lunch will take care of themselves. For budget, anywhere between $25 - $80. It will mostly be just for myself, as I don't think my boss will tag along every evening. I'm not shy to sit in a restaurant by myself so that should be alright.

Speaking of coffee, I heard Melbourne has a very good coffee culture and I would love to try. Please also recommend a few coffee shops that's also around the area.

The only day that I will have time to go outside the area to explore is the day I arrive. Any recommendation for a Sunday day trip around the city? Will probably be able to drop my stuffs off at the hotel by noon and have the rest of the day free to explore.

Thank you all in advance for the tips and recommendations!",1,1731469821.0,AskAnAustralian,5,1.0,False
1gq41ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/PittsburghSocialClub/comments/1gq41ht/26m_looking_to_make_some_new_friends/,26M - Looking to make some new friends,"Hey what's up everyone,

26M here looking to meet some people around my age in the area.

I grew up north of the city (near Butler), moved to Virginia for 8 years (JMU Alum if anyone else here is as well), and just moved back this summer and am living in the south hills. It's been tough meeting up with old friends from my hometown consistently, and I have some family nearby but it'd be awesome to meet some new people in or near the city.

Working from home doing tech consulting but have been starting to venture out of the house and check out some new coffee shops around town, and am always down to meet up at new spots. In general, super laid back and go-with-the flow, love to hit bars on the weekend, play trivia, golf (and play any kind of sport really), and have gotten into real estate on the side so it'd be cool to meet people who are into that too. Also a huge Pittsburgh sports fan and love to catch games whenever there's time. I workout in the mornings at the Crunch in Pleasant Hills so if anyone else happens to go there too it'd be chill to have someone to workout and BS with haha

Always down for new experiences too and love trying new restaurants and pizza spots.

Feel free to shoot me a DM, I'm free over the weekends and a few evenings during the week!",2,1731469609.0,PittsburghSocialClub,0,1.0,False
1gq411o,https://www.reddit.com/r/dyshidrosiseczema/comments/1gq411o/opzelura/,Opzelura ,"Hi everyone. Long time Reddit user, but I‚Äôve never posted before. Around 2016, I started to develop DE. I worked at a coffee shop, and I believe that cleaning chemicals, combined with having wet hands from washing dishes may have triggered it for me. It started on my right pinky, but has now spread to all of my fingers on both hands, and my right wrist. 
I visited multiple allergists and tried different diets and different topical steroids. I had a prescription for Triamcinolone and at another point, Clobex. They worked slightly, but it worked more to dull the pain, and to help heal the cracks in my skin. I started a gluten free diet in 2020, but the difference it made was pretty inconsequential. 
This last year, I started to see a new allergist after moving, and he was able to get me a prescription for Opzelura. After googling, this is a relatively new medication released in 2021 and/or 2022. It‚Äôs a cream that is used to reduce inflammation by inhibiting the Janus kinase enzyme. 
This cream is expensive, with prices around ~$3000, but if you‚Äôre unable to afford this cost with your income, you can apply for assistance to have the price covered. My doctor was able to fill out paperwork to submit to my insurance after I provided my income (~45k), and my copay is $0. 
The cream takes a very small amount, and in my case is extremely effective. After applying, within 24  hours all of my blisters are gone. It stops the itching fast after applying, and it‚Äôs really been a life changer. 
I never thought that I would have normal looking hands again, or that I would never be embarrassed to shake or hold someone‚Äôs hand. At my worst, my skin was constantly flaking off, or I was bleeding on something due to the cracks on my knuckles and fingers. Besides some scarring, I now have normal looking hands, and I‚Äôm extremely grateful. If I have gluten or alcohol now (which triggers the DE for me) I can just use the cream when I start to see the blisters, and they‚Äôre gone by the next day when I wake up. 
I hope this doesn‚Äôt sound like I‚Äôm selling something, but after being in this group for a while, I know how debilitating and painful this eczema can be, and I can‚Äôt not share something that might help someone else. ",1,1731469568.0,dyshidrosiseczema,0,1.0,False

It was a typical Wednesday morning when Juanito decided to call in to his favorite radio show, ""La Mano Peluda,"" which roughly¬†

translates to ""The Furry Hand."" The program was known for its quirky and often absurd conversations, and Juanito had always been¬†

fascinated by the eclectic mix of callers and topics.

  


As he dialed the number on his phone, Juanito couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and nervousness. He had been waiting all¬†

week to share his bizarre observation with the world.

  


When the host, the energetic and charismatic Luis, picked up the phone, Juanito took a deep breath and began his story.

  


""¬°Hola! ¬øQui√©n es?"" Luis asked, always ready for another wild caller.

  


""I'm calling from... um... wherever I am,"" Juanito replied. ""I just had to share this with you all.""

  


Luis chuckled knowingly. ""Okay, amigo. What's on your mind?""

  


Juanito hesitated for a moment before blurting out his unusual tale. ""I've been observing a donkey in the field next to my house, and¬†

it has... well, I know this sounds crazy, but it has the head of a pig.""

  


There was a pause on the other end of the line. Luis laughed heartily, almost spitting out his coffee.

  


""¬°Ay, caramba! ¬°El puerco-palito!"" he exclaimed. ""That's like something from a fairy tale!""

  


Juanito nodded enthusiastically, even though Luis couldn't see him. ""I know it sounds absurd, but I swear it's true. The donkey is¬†

eating the grass just like any other animal, but every now and then, its head would twitch back and forth, and I could have sworn I¬†

saw a little pig snout peeking out.""

  


Luis laughed even harder, tears streaming down his face. ""¬°Este tipo est√° loco!"" he cried. ""We need to get you on the air more¬†

often!""

  


The listeners began to chime in, asking questions and making jokes about the alleged donkey-pig hybrid. Juanito giggled along with¬†

them, feeling a sense of belonging among these strangers who were now sharing his strange experience.

  


As the conversation continued, Luis decided to take matters into his own hands. ""Amigo Juanito, I need you to come down to the studio¬†

and join us live. We'll get to the bottom of this... ahem... unusual sighting.""

  


Juanito's heart skipped a beat. He had never been on a radio show before, but something about Luis's infectious energy made him¬†

agree.

  


As Juanito arrived at the studio, he was greeted by Luis, his team, and a sea of curious faces. The atmosphere was electric, with¬†

cameras and microphones set up all around.

  


Luis took Juanito under his wing, introducing him to the crew and the live audience. Together, they poked fun at the absurdity of it¬†

all, but also asked some serious questions about Juanito's observation.

  


As the broadcast came to a close, Luis turned to Juanito with a mischievous grin. ""Amigo, we may never find out if your donkey-pig¬†

friend is real or not, but one thing's for sure: you'll always be our special guest on 'La Mano Peluda'!""

  


The studio erupted in applause as Juanito walked off the set, feeling like a celebrity, albeit an unlikely one. From that day¬†

forward, he knew he had found his tribe ‚Äì a group of people who celebrated the bizarre and the unknown.

  


And whenever Juanito glanced out at the fields next to his house, he couldn't help but wonder: was that really just his imagination¬†

playing tricks on him? Or was there indeed something unusual lurking in the shadows, waiting to be discovered?",1,1731468926.0,LasAventurasDeEnrique,0,1.0,False

#Overview and Helpful Links

The Current‚Äôs stadium is in Kansas City, **Missouri** (KCMO). Kansas City, Kansas (KCK) is the one with the best [tacos](https://www.visitkansascityks.com/blog/post/kck-taco-trail-101/) and pupusas.

- [NWSL Championship Fan Fest](https://www.nwslsoccer.com/championship-fanfest)

- [VisitKC](https://www.visitkc.com)


&#x200B;


&#x200B;


###Neighborhoods

The key neighborhood near the stadium is the Rivermarket. It‚Äôs filled with restaurants, coffee, shops, and a weekend farmer‚Äôs market. Shuttles will be leaving from there, and the streetcar makes several stops in the area. 

&#x200B;

Immediately south of there is Downtown and the Power & Light District. Lots of hotels, and P&L is where we often cheer on the USWNT.

&#x200B;

Further south of there, below the highway, is the Crossroads. Filled with restaurants, bars, art galleries, breweries, live music, and hotels, it is my personal favorite part of the city.

&#x200B;

Just south of there is Crown Center/Union Station, the final stop on the streetcar (until the extension opens), and home to even more hotels and attractions. If you‚Äôre traveling with younger children, this might be the ideal place to stay. For fans of any age, if you get a chance to walk through Union Station, it‚Äôs a lovely space and grabbing a drink at Pierpont‚Äôs will give you a flavor of vintage Kansas City.


&#x200B;

&#x200B;


#Where to stay

u/PhTea suggests ‚ÄúAny of the hotels in the Crossroads/Power & Light‚Äù. Those will be within easy ride share or streetcar distance of the stadium.

u/Leighroy1120 adds, ‚ÄúIf folks can swing it, I‚Äôd recommend staying at Loews. When my partner and I were living out of town and had to commute to games earlier this year, we stayed there many times and it was a great hotel! It‚Äôs close to the streetcar and restaurants and there‚Äôs a nice bar in the main lobby as well. It‚Äôs also pet friendly!‚Äù

The Museum Hotel 21c is also well-liked, and right across the street from a jazz bar. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;


#Food and Drink


##Stadium Food

You are in for a treat. Our stadium food vendors are a highlight reel of excellent Kansas City restaurants. You could have a great time just visiting each one on the list. 

&#x200B;

##Barbecue

This is the inevitable question, and there are many great answers.

- u/helpbeingheldhostage says ‚ÄúJoe‚Äôs Kansas City is the answer. Or, at least, if you are only going to go to one‚Ä¶Joe‚Äôs.‚Äù

[Editor‚Äôs note: The original gas station location is often considered the best. Joe‚Äôs also has a smaller menu in the stadium, but the full experience is a great time. Get the fries.]

- Other favorites include Slap‚Äôs, Q39, Arthur Bryant‚Äôs, Jack Stack, Gates, LC‚Äôs, and Char Bar. 

- One of my personal favorites is Buck Tui Barbecue, which incorporates Northern Thai flavors with spectacular results. There are few other places like this in the world: their brisket rangoon makes me proud of America.


&#x200B;


##Other restaurants and eateries

- Not far from the stadium is **Cafe Ca Phe**, a beloved Vietnamese coffee spot that strongly supports the community.

- **Christopher Elbow Chocolates** - make a trip to the Crossroads to snack on some edible art. I'm partial to their caramels. 

- **Messenger Coffee** - fantastic baked goods in a bright, multi-level space. Get a kouign-amann, which is about as delicious to eat as it is difficult to figure out how to pronounce.




&#x200B;

In the Rivermarket neighborhood near the stadium, u/KickapooPonies recommends these spots:

- Block 15 is where Blue Crew hosts tailgates. Not sure what they will do that weekend, but likely there still. 

- Varsity Club is right next door to Block 15. Cocktails and smash burgers.

- Strange Days Brewing. Brewery that loves soccer.

- Harry's Country Club 



&#x200B;


##Nightlife

- u/midito421 offers a list of LGBTQ bars: ‚ÄúMissie B‚Äôs for drag/dance, Woody‚Äôs for theme nights and patio seating, Sidekicks Saloon for more Western vibes and smaller venue, and of course Gael‚Äôs for sports!‚Äù

- The Green Lady Lounge is a city favorite, with two floors of live jazz in a lovely space.

- For more suggestions, drop a question in the comments to let us know what you'd like!


&#x200B;


#Daytime activities

- u/Esb5415 suggests, ‚Äú**Boulevard** is a local brewery that has a pretty cool tour and pretty good beer if that is your sort of thing. Plus, they have a close relationship with the Current!‚Äù [Note: Their beer hall is also pretty great and also just pretty.]

- The **Nelson Atkins Museum of Art** is free and fantastic for all ages.

- For fans of baseball, the **Negro Leagues Museum** is based in KC.

- For fans of intractable trench warfare, the **National World War I Museum** is also based in KC.

- u/b2717 says they ‚Äúhighly highly recommend the **Steamboat Arabia Museum** - I've never seen anything quite like it anywhere else. On paper I thought ‚Äòquestionable‚Äô but it‚Äôs ended up being a highlight for me and multiple rounds of guests.‚Äù


&#x200B;


#Transportation

- u/Eowyn753 says, ‚ÄúTake advantage of the streetcar! Like all public transit in KC, it is FREE. It also covers pretty much all of downtown and can get you anywhere from Union Station up to the River Market. That means it can be a good way to get to the shuttle stops or the path to CPKC if you‚Äôre walking.‚Äù

- For visitors with cars, u/Valsholly cautions, ‚ÄúBe aware of KCMO's new ‚Äòsurge pricing‚Äô applicable to many street parking spots. That's $30-40 per spot during Current games in many locations downtown and in the River Market. Probably helpful for those driving to [download the city's parking app](https://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/departments/public-works/parking/app)‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt get my period until I was 16. I was usually irregular but I always got a period every month, sometimes twice in a month. In 2019 I went on birth control because I took a plan b and got my period for 2 months straight at the age of 19. Yes I said 2 months straight. 60 days. I was then on birth control until 2021. the combo pill. When I went off of it to get skinny, it worked. I lost the water retention weight, but my boobs and my hips were huge. 

To my surprise, my periods were extremely regular off the pill and I would get them every month, no pain, no cramps, everything was normal. In 2022 I went to the gyno for the usual check up. everything was still perfect. A year later I was in my prime. Skinny, hot, everything was great. But I realized I had skipped a period month, and noticed my period was irregular for about 3 months. I was also going through extreme stress. The symptoms started at this time. 

I rapidly gained about 10 lbs of weight. The same 10 lbs would fluctuate. I looked terrifyingly bloated in the face, wide neck, hump on neck, hair pattern changes on body/head, no definition in waist, extreme bloating in upper and lower stomach area, and I would throw up in the morning and after eating food. I had bad cramps during periods now, I felt fatigue every single day of the month, sleep apnea, insomnia, woke up feeling like I didn‚Äôt sleep all night (my watch would calculate 4 hrs of sleep even though I ‚Äúslept‚Äù for 8) bags under my eyes and major headaches/migraines in the morning, with extreme night sweats and waking up at 4 am with nightmares. ontop of this I was very moody and developed anger issues. I very hormonal as well. something was off balance every day. BUT I was still ovulating and still getting a period. 

I booked an appointment with an endocrinologist and after she immediately suggested medicine and the non fda approved inositol, and to stop eating white rice and other carbs, I pushed for us to approached the holistic route before starting anything.

We took blood tests. My testosterone was high, high cortisol, all forms of high cholesterol, high fatty liver, everything you could think of. BUT, the major things like Ac1, Thyroid, and insulin all came back normal. Why was this? Does this mean adrenal pcos? We ruled out cushings at the endo as well with a steroid test. I tried yoga, meditating, low intensity workouts, ovasitol and vitamins, I stopped drinking coffee on an empty stomach, I cut out gluten and dairy for a while so that I wasn‚Äôt so inflamed. I was still struggling. Ovasitol gave me a raging headache and made me feel faint/lowered my blood sugar too low. Working out with light intensity still stressed out my body. I ate extremely clean whole foods. I limited my alcohol. If I messed up 1 day of this lifestyle I was back at square 1. This was no way to live. My body‚Äôs anxiety and stress levels were at its max. Still nothing moved in the blood work. I went to the allergist and she diagnosed me with a soy allergy and other common allergies, but not wheat. Most women with pcos have soy intolerance and gluten.

Each day that went on unmedicated I started to look and feel worse and worse and felt helpless. After the ultrasound confirmed I had pcos, I was prescribed a combination birth control pill. This did not fix my high testosterone. Before starting medication we tested again. My advanced lipid panel was all bad/red, so was ALT, testosterone, cortisol, vitamin d was at the bare minimum 
range of 31, the average lowest being 30. My FSH was normal‚Ä¶ DHEA was normal, LH was normal, estrogen normal as well. What is going on??? I then made the choice to take spironolactone after trying to lower testosterone and stress again‚Ä¶my remedies were not making any difference. 

The first day I took the birth control I woke up feeling like 1 million bucks. My blood work started to get better after the 3 months. I realized I went from 180 to 202 after starting birth control and spironolactone. My face, neck, arms, stomach, lower body all blew up like a balloon even thought spironolactone is supposed to be a diurect. It was then that I started tirzepatide at 5mg and have been on the same dose for months now. I have shed 20 lbs. I felt better, my clothes fit better, and i‚Äôm still fluctuating in weight. When I take the tirzepatide I feel sick, my birth control and spironolactone aren‚Äôt absorbed all the way, so mood swings still occur, my hormones may not be exactly balanced as they should, the spironolactone fluctuates my breast size and heart patterns due to absorbtion, and my cortisol still remains high. Still no cushings.

So now, i‚Äôm stuck on birth control and spironolactone with slight heart palpitations and I would like to have children eventually. I am afraid to get off of both of these until I want kids. All of my symptoms will become worse when I get off. I am also scared of the risks that untreated pcos can have on future fertility and overall well being.

Pretty impressed with this being a 20% flower and especially at $7.5/g. Gives me the melted couch lock feeling that I look for to help turn off. 

Buds were a good size and purple-ish and had a creamy coffee smell. Ground up nicely and vaped smooth at 180c. 

Shoutout to Better Leaf for selling me the 10g for $75 when the 10‚Äôs are normally $135 (weird?). Will be getting the 20g for $150 as my daily go-to but will probably keep Platinum Grapes for the times I need something extra. üôåüôå",4,1731468688.0,MedicalCannabisOz,3,0.83,False

Here's the background:¬†

She‚Äôs incredibly caring and considerate‚Äîalmost clingy. She often brings over food she‚Äôs cooked, makes sure I‚Äôm eating well, and genuinely makes me feel cared for. I've fallen for her, and for most of the relationship, I thought she felt the same.¬†

However, about 4 months in, she told me something that shook me. We were sitting on the couch, and she said, \*‚ÄúYou know I don‚Äôt get those strong feelings, and don‚Äôt think I can.‚Äù\* It caught me off guard, and I responded, \*‚ÄúI think everyone can, you just haven‚Äôt met the right person.‚Äù\*¬†

At that moment, I felt like the relationship was pointless. If she wasn‚Äôt capable of developing strong feelings, what were we doing? I even started seeing it as more of a casual or FWB situation. But she stayed over that night.¬†

The next morning, my behavior had clearly shifted‚ÄîI was distant. She picked up on it and apologized for what she said, claiming she \*did\* have feelings for me. I told her if she didn‚Äôt feel anything after 4 months, then there wasn‚Äôt much point in continuing the relationship. I‚Äôve been through a lot in relationships, and I‚Äôm not looking to invest in someone who doesn‚Äôt truly want to be with me.¬†

Fast forward to now, two months later, and there‚Äôs a new complication. She‚Äôs been talking about a guy named Jack, someone she met on a dating app before we started dating. She initially told me they only had coffee, decided to be friends, and that there was no intimacy between them. But when she talks about him, there‚Äôs a passion I‚Äôve never seen her express for me. She even said something like, \*‚ÄúI want Jack to meet you so I can rub it in his face.‚Äù\*¬†

That didn‚Äôt sit right with me. I told her I wanted no part of it. She then admitted she messages Jack every day but emphasized that she chooses to be with me.¬†

Here‚Äôs the thing: I suspect she has unresolved feelings for him. Maybe even a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenario playing out in her mind. I feel like if the opportunity with Jack came up, she might leave me for him.¬†

I care about her, but I‚Äôm not sure if this relationship has a solid future. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.¬†",2,1731468683.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

I didn‚Äôt get my period until I was 16. I was usually irregular but I always got a period every month, sometimes twice in a month. In 2019 I went on birth control because I took a plan b and got my period for 2 months straight at the age of 19. Yes I said 2 months straight. 60 days. I was then on birth control until 2021. the combo pill. When I went off of it to get skinny, it worked. I lost the water retention weight, but my boobs and my hips were huge. 

To my surprise, my periods were extremely regular off the pill and I would get them every month, no pain, no cramps, everything was normal. In 2022 I went to the gyno for the usual check up. everything was still perfect. A year later I was in my prime. Skinny, hot, everything was great. But I realized I had skipped a period month, and noticed my period was irregular for about 3 months. I was also going through extreme stress. The symptoms started at this time. 

I rapidly gained about 10 lbs of weight. The same 10 lbs would fluctuate. I looked terrifyingly bloated in the face, wide neck, hump on neck, hair pattern changes on body/head, no definition in waist, extreme bloating in upper and lower stomach area, and I would throw up in the morning and after eating food. I had bad cramps during periods now, I felt fatigue every single day of the month, sleep apnea, insomnia, woke up feeling like I didn‚Äôt sleep all night (my watch would calculate 4 hrs of sleep even though I ‚Äúslept‚Äù for 8) bags under my eyes and major headaches/migraines in the morning, with extreme night sweats and waking up at 4 am with nightmares. ontop of this I was very moody and developed anger issues. I very hormonal as well. something was off balance every day. BUT I was still ovulating and still getting a period. 

I booked an appointment with an endocrinologist and after she immediately suggested medicine and the non fda approved inositol, and to stop eating white rice and other carbs, I pushed for us to approached the holistic route before starting anything.

We took blood tests. My testosterone was high, high cortisol, all forms of high cholesterol, high fatty liver, everything you could think of.

1gq3ezs,https://i.redd.it/4hnjz6i66l0e1.png," Wednesday 11-13-2024 | Word of The Day ""Is Life Too Short?"" ‚Ä¢ [Click to Expand]","## Making Every Moment Matter

We often hear people lament that life is too short, but perhaps we're looking at it all wrong. The real issue isn't the brevity of life ‚Äì it's how we choose to fill those precious hours. Think about your typical day: how many minutes slip away while scrolling through social media, or getting lost in the endless stream of notifications? I'll admit, I've caught myself countless times reaching for my phone out of pure habit, only to emerge thirty minutes later wondering where the time went.

Our relationship with time is peculiar. We treat it as both infinite and scarce ‚Äì hoarding it when we should spend it freely on what matters, yet frittering it away on things that add little value to our lives. It's like having a bank account that gets refilled each morning, but instead of investing the funds wisely, we let them dissolve on trivial purchases we won't remember by sunset.

Consider this: when we're lying on our deathbed, will we wish we'd watched more Netflix shows or spent more hours at the office? More likely, we'll think about the conversations we never had, the risks we were too afraid to take, or the dreams we kept postponing until that mythical ""someday."" The tragedy isn't that we don't have enough time ‚Äì it's that we spend so much of it on autopilot, letting our days be shaped by habit and circumstance rather than intention and purpose.

Living intentionally doesn't mean every minute needs to be productive or profound. Sometimes the most meaningful use of time is simply being present ‚Äì feeling the warmth of the sun on your face, truly listening to a friend's story, or savoring a quiet moment with a cup of coffee. It's about making conscious choices rather than letting life happen to us by default.

I've started experimenting with a simple practice: before starting any activity, I pause for just a moment and ask myself, ""Is this how I want to spend this irreplaceable slice of my life?"" Sometimes the answer is yes ‚Äì even if the activity seems ""unproductive"" by conventional standards. Other times, this brief moment of reflection helps me redirect my energy toward something more aligned with my values and aspirations.

The challenge lies not in managing time ‚Äì we all get the same 24 hours ‚Äì but in managing our attention and energy. These are the true currencies of a well-lived life. When we scatter them thoughtlessly, we end up feeling both busy and unfulfilled, running on a hamster wheel of endless tasks and distractions. But when we direct them intentionally toward what truly matters to us, even a ordinary day can feel rich with meaning and purpose.

Small changes can make a profound difference. Maybe it's carving out fifteen minutes each morning for reflection or creativity before the world starts making demands on our attention. Perhaps it's setting boundaries around technology use or learning to say ""no"" to commitments that don't align with our priorities. The key is making these choices consciously rather than drifting along with the current of routine and obligation.

Time will pass regardless of how we choose to use it. The question is whether we'll look back on our days with satisfaction, knowing we spent them in ways that mattered to us, or with regret for all the moments we let slip away unnoticed. After all, life is long enough for what truly matters ‚Äì if only we're intentional about making space for it.

\- my (19F) ex girlfriend (19F) now has a new girlfriend (19F) and they have been dating since around April I believe

\- my ex girlfriend is a compulsive liar and its often hard to know when she is telling the truth about something due to the frequency of her lies. they can be extreme lies too

\- in around august I drunkenly added her on snapchat to see if she would add me back. I sent her a long  message basically saying I was still in love with her, this was bad of me to do and I regret doing it 

\- after that she still talked to me for a couple weeks, snapping each other, catching up, we called a few times, but then she started complaining about her current gf to me, we started exchanging some sexual texts and eventually sent nudes to each other (ik its bad). we both agreed not to tell anyone about this and definitely didn't want her gf finding out

\- she ultimately decided to remove me on snapchat for the sake of her gf and we wouldn't talk again which she explained and I understood but she continued to watch my stories on instagram and TikTok until blocking me on literally every platform 

\- last week, she added me back on snapchat and we started talking again but it was different this time, we were being civil  and purely just catching up on each others lives. she started complaining about her gf again and told me she broke up with her the night before (the same night she added me) because apparently her gf wasn't over her OWN ex and was hanging out with him and kept all their old sex videos

\- we planned to go out for coffee on the weekend when I was get back to the city we both live in

\- she then blocked me randomly, and about an hour later, I saw her gf posting about how in love they are on her instagram story (which she was also doing last time) so im not sure if she lied about them breaking up or if they just sorted things out and got back together. 

\- I have tried to reach out to her but obviously ive been blocked so my messages aren't sending but I wanted to let her know that is wrong and unfair to do to both of us tbh but especially her current gf , who I can't even be certain has done anything wrong because its highly possible that my ex lied

I want to know if I should send her current gf a text to let her know everything but I don't want to ruin their relationship because she is soooooo happy and in love and very clueless, I don't want my ex to hate me because I obviously still love her, but she definitely will hate me if I tell her gf, im also not sure if its worth mentioning and breaking them up over something that might be considered kinda silly, especially if it actually is true that her gf was seeing HER ex (small chance but you never know). maybe I should just let fate do its thing and stay out of their lives but idk

I met with him and his work bff for a ""work"" chat, which also went really well (as in we talked way longer than necessary). Also I'm socially nervous so I'm hyper aware if I'm keeping someone too long which I did not sense. If anything they were keeping me. He paid for all our coffees so I venmo'ed him, which would've been an opportunity to exchange numbers but he told me I could skip the verify step.

She has been going thorugh some internal evaluations that require TONS of paperwork, many of it been done after work hours.

For the most part I've been very supportive and understanding, specially considering that she has had a terrible year.

2 times a week I go to her place and help her inject some medicine to her cat since she has problems to do it herself, I stay there for the night.

Her place is about 30 minutes from my place and this means that whenever I stay there during the week, the next day I have to leave 30 minutes earlier than usual (6:30 am) to work.

Last Sunday I got to her place @21:00 for injection day and ask her to watch a movie or something, she told me she had to work, I told her that working on a Sunday night won't change much her situation and she told me that her job was super important, here I told her that her job was tolling our relationship and that she should try to do her work on working hours.

She got really mad, and ask me if I wanted her to take me home (basically asked to leave) and left to work in another room, I sat there reflected a little and went back to her and told her that I felt relegated by her job.

She insisted in that I was disrespecting her autonomy, which might be true, I was annoyed so as I was already invited to leave, I left to my place.

Yesterday we discussed the issue over the phone, I told her that although I might have crossed a line and that it is possible that I actually disrespected her autonomy, she still made me feel like my time was less worthy than hers, since she wasn't seeing the time I took to buy the medicine for the cat, to go to her place and the earlier wake up time if I stayed there.

Today I told her to meet after work for donuts and coffee, She told me she was still at work I said that it was ok, I wasn't home yet. (18:20)

After my place was ready to receive her, I told her I was at home (18:55), later she told me she won't be finishing work until 20:00 so she wanted to reschedule for another day, so here I told her again that it is clear that my time is a lot less valuable than hers, since she is not making decisions like saying ""hey, I'm done for today, gotta go"" (She can do it), I told her that it was ok at 20:00 but I was still annoyed, she told me that her intentions were to see me, but that she couldn't make it on time.

She never showed up, called me later saying that she left work near 21:30, here she was asking me to be more supportive so I decided to tell her to be on her own until she finishes with these reports (until next monday) because I didn't want to take away her time with my needs.

She told me that she expected me to be more supportive and caring with her, I told her that I didn't feel like, since last time I did, she didn't care and sent me home, so this was my way of being supportive, to move out of the way until next Tuesday.

My question is...

Am I being too selfish?

I don‚Äôt know much about deep cleaning wood. My original intent was to stain this a little darker and turn it into a coffee nook, but after seeing the inside I‚Äôm a little iffy on using it for food stuff. üòÖ

Can it be salvaged? If so, how would y‚Äôall recommend I go about it?

to start you are going to want to spend some money to be precise 185 to 285 USD.

Ideally you will do all of the following on protons free VPN this is the only free VPN I would trust in the least. link [https://protonvpn.com/free-vpn?srsltid=AfmBOootcFpYEcysCdqwdBq2znqESX6hfwBIydDVRY3qj2Ipg0xobAxW](https://protonvpn.com/free-vpn?srsltid=AfmBOootcFpYEcysCdqwdBq2znqESX6hfwBIydDVRY3qj2Ipg0xobAxW)

70 dollars to Mullvad VPN ideally you should use the pay with cash option where in you create an account you will be given an account number WRITE THIS DOWN at least 3 times on three separate pieces of paper put one by your PC one in your phone case and one in a safety deposit box. If you lose this number your account will not be recoverable, then if you are paying with cash you will select pay with cash then be given a onetime code write it on a piece of paper put it in the envelop with cash and write mullvads address on it along with a few stamps don't include a return address and wait two to three weeks. (that is why we are doing this now)

pay for the following with a prepaid CC bought with cash keep in mind the fees associated with them

Pay 20 dollars to [https://easyoptouts.com/](https://easyoptouts.com/) in consumer reports testing EOO was the second best at data deletion at 65% removal this is the cheap option

sigh up and IF you want pay 100 dollars to [https://www.optery.com/](https://www.optery.com/) only go with the ultimate plan if you go with optery (which is what CR tested) and personally I would recommend giving them more data to get their full 600+ site removal but I understand if you want them to have as little info as possible.

buy a subscription to [redact.dev](http://redact.dev) for 95.88 (if you have a social media presence)

OK you can close your wallet now.

pick an email provider either Tutamail ([https://tuta.com/](https://tuta.com/)) or protonmail ([https://proton.me/mail](https://proton.me/mail))

one of these will be your main trusted email. That let me stress you should not give out to anyone except your bank and highly trusted accounts. the other will be your spam now I should tell you in 2023 a former RCMP officer who was in court for corruption charges claimed tutamail was a 5 eyes honeypot

make a email you trust less (either proton or tuta) and be ready to use it.

now

go into your email and search the following.

Verification, signup, register, account, and completion our goal here is to find every website you have ever signed up for move all of the ones you find to a separate file. This is to remind you of which accounts you have made from all sources now go through and and login to each account and do the following.

social media

mass edit your created content with redact if available follow this by unliking, unfollowing, unfavoriting every single thing you have ever interacted with then mass delete everything you have ever posted. look into their account deletion requirements([https://justdeleteme.xyz/](https://justdeleteme.xyz/) is a good resource if you cannot find it) if they require an email to delete your account treat them as respectable if they allow you to delete it yourself change your password to as long as they allow or at least 64 digits (this is a decent password generator [https://my.norton.com/extspa/passwordmanager?path=pwd-gen](https://my.norton.com/extspa/passwordmanager?path=pwd-gen) ) finally if it is a respectable site change your email address to your tuta or proton account and if it is a sketchy site change it to a [https://www.guerrillamail.com/](https://www.guerrillamail.com/) address and delete your account. remember that Meta and other social media may keep your data for up to 90 days and will release even deleted account info to LEOs

dating sites

edit and then delete every reaction, comment and dm you ever sent. upload new photos not of you and that you did not take to avoid metadata leaking (someone getting the GPS data off the pic) change your name, role, gender, hobbies, and questions absolutly nothing on your profile should be in anyway accurate to you change your location to a small town in the middle of nowhere that is ideally multipul states away. Now change your password (never reuse even randomly generated passwords) change the email and delete the account.

do that or some variation there of with every account that you have that you do not HAVE to keep for the rest (banking. medical. possibly reddit if you wish) redact most or all of reddit or the social media that you keep removal all localized info (your state, favorite coffee shop, all photos etc) move the accounts to a none spam email

when you are done deleting or moving your accounts we ideally want to find several unique files or repository that we can email and will completely fill our old email(if you all have ideas leave them in the comments) do this with unique info multiple times (Ideally 21 times) after which we will delete the email account entirely.

so at this point you're probably thinking ""Why do all this work rather then just delete the account?"" well we are practicing data poisoning so that anyone looking behind us cannot really pin us to anything unless they logged our IP address or our VPNs IP address(if you kept using the free proton one for this)

the reason for this mass deletion and data poisoning is that data broker either buy from these sites or scrap(have an program read and record) these sites or the sites themselves are owned by data brokers. meaning even if we pay every opt out service and opt out of every single data broker on the Big Ass Data Broker Opt Out List our names, addresses, email, phone number and more will all most likely be right back on there in 6 months. by deleting and poisoning so many accounts we make ourselves very hard to find vs the average person.

the BADBOOL (link: [https://github.com/yaelwrites/Big-Ass-Data-Broker-Opt-Out-List](https://github.com/yaelwrites/Big-Ass-Data-Broker-Opt-Out-List) ) go through and opt out of every single data broker (if you have more resources such as this post them in the comments) you will likely have to email them multiple times use either the email they have on you or your new spam email.

when we are done I want you to take that spam tuta or proton mail account you made (and it should be the free version) and bloat it like you did to your old one (remember ideally fill and empty it 21 times) and delete it

security

select a locally hosted password manager I like keepass. ([https://keepass.info/download.html](https://keepass.info/download.html)) It should hold your passwords encrypted locally on your device and you should have a long password as your master password at least 22 digits and it should be randomly generated with upper case, lower case, special characters and numbers. on top of this it is best practice to seed a password so we save a password with our password manager then somewhere in the password we insert a set of characters after the auto fill which we will never write down or tell to anyone. Ideally I would suggest having two one seed is for offline use only such as our password manager and one which is a randomly generated string, this is what that looks like (note these are not my real seeds)

we have our seeds of trusted: betyoucantguessthis and our untrusted: sAc=6R

we randomly generate a password for an account such as the following

geXuphlhikaBrA0uphuslbrlwrothuphoqapHecrLnaf$YeStunldlhigobabrLp

then we insert our seed somewhere however it always needs to be in the same place so our un trusted version of this password is as follows

geXuphlsAc=6RhikaBrA0uphuslbrlwrothuphoqapHecrLnaf$YeStunldlhigobabrLp

and our trusted version is

gbetyoucantguessthiseXuphlhikaBrA0uphuslbrlwrothuphoqapHecrLnaf$YeStunldlhigobabrLp

the reason for the trusted vs untrusted seeds is that if anyone where to get our unhashed (encrypted) passwords with our trusted seeds they would know that we seed our passwords and would likely modify any brute force attack against us. however if our untrusted seed is leaked in a unhashed format no one would be able to tell it was not part of our first randomly generated password. on the otherside of the screen by utilizing seeds even if our open phone is handed over no one will be able to open our account and will be forced to try a brute force attack. passwords for sites( that are only stored in our password manager) should be as long as you can make them and still fit your seeds or at least 64 digits and I personally would not trust a site that limited passwords to under 22.

a note on storing your passwords NEVER STORE YOUR SEEDS and for all others ideally have three copies they should be on two different media types and one should be off site (in a cache or safety deposit box) and they should be encrypted with either veracrypt or PGP but if you use a PGP key to encrypt your data you should never use that PGP key for anything else at any point for any reason.",7,1731465945.0,transguns,2,1.0,False

1gq2usi,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1gq2usi/for_people_in_relationships_are_you_tempted_to/,"For people in relationships, Are you tempted to cheat or break up if you find someone better/looks better than ur current SO? ","The problem: Why do I get the feeling that although your person loves you so much if ever they get in another situation or country, work, school they can just leave you for someone else?  
  
What I've Tried so Far : 

I asked my SO(26F) regarding this and she said its inevitable that people get interested to liking someone else especially for Long Distance relationships, like she said hindi nya raw kaya na hindi nag kikita ng matagal or something. Kasi sense of touch ang love language nya.

Medjo nasaktan ako kasi 2yrs na kami sa relationship pero nasasabi nya na yan nung 1 yr palang kami.  Sabi ko pano pag nagkagusto ka sa iba dahil malayo ka sa significant other mo?

sabi nya syempre tao lang tao nag hahanap ng tayo ng makakasama ganon. She comes from a well off family na tipong kung gusgto nya mag aral sa ibang bansa kaya i afford ng magulang nya or humingi lang sya ng bagong kotse kaya nya. 

Pero hindi nya kasi un priority or hindi sya lumaking matapobre. Vs ako(27M) na lahat ng naabot ko sa buhay is ako lang talaga gumawa, I had toxic parents and broken family growing up so I had to become an adult agad sa early teenage years ko. Alam mo un wla naman akong planong humiwalay sakanya, and I see her as my wife in the future ganon ko sya kamahal, I had gfs na rin naman before along the way kaya naexperience ko na rin magkaron ng toxic ones, and others. Kay SO, ako kasi ung real first relationship nya.

Natatakot lang ako na baka pag napunta sya ibang bansa andali sakanya iwan ung buhay nya dito or ako to look for afam or other people na within her closer range. Even though wala naman problem na malala sa relationship nyo na cheating or something.  
  
What advice I need : 

Matagal na to pero nangyare na kasi samin dati na nag pumilit sya sumama sa isang office trip nila sa Japan, una di sagot ng office nila ung trip parang utang sa office muna tas sa end of the year nila babayaran, instead na 50k per person magiging 20k nalang atleast including visa and the like. Nag taka ako bakit kailangan nya sumama kasi well travelled naman sila ng family nya and nakapunta na sya sa japan ng ilang beses na. 

Second is senior nya ung nagkagusto/nanligaw sakanya dati at kasama doon sa trip. Pero binasted nya na after makilala ako. Pero kung di ako nakilala baka naging sila pa. Ever since naging kami awkward na rin ung pakikitungo ng senior nya sakanya kung dati close sila as work colleagues ngayon hindi na sya sinasama or inaaya kumain ng mga kasama nya sa opisina dahil may bf na nga sya. For me ok lang un na wag mo na sila pansinin kasi wala naman silang bearing sa buhay mo I keep saying that but people pleaser kasi si gf gusto nya goods sya sa lahat walang akwardness sa ibang tao kht dati na kayo nag something. Di ko rin naman alam kung hanggang saan sila umabot non. Baka hinawakan din kamay nya before or baka nag kiss na sila idk and idont care na nung kami na. 

3rd is, nung andon na sila sa Japan, nagkaron ng ayaan ng last day inom/party by pupuntahan ng mga lalakeng workmates sila sa hotel na pinagsastayan ng mga babaeng coworkers nila. 

Lahat ng pwedeng itanong tinanong ko na pero pinilit nya lang na wala na sya magagawa , pumunta na ung mga lalake doon etc. Sabi pa nya sakin ayaw ko raw ba sya mag enjoy naman lang etc. Syempre hindi sa ganon. Mas takot ako kasi pwedeng pagkaisahan sya tulungan sya nung friends nung mga lalake na makaisa sa gf ko kasi malayo sila sakin. Hindi naman ako asap parang city lang na madrdrive ko ang japan.  tas after nong nagalit ako hindi ko sya kinakausap tapos send sya ng send na kasama nya ung friend nyang babae na after nila mag inom sa japan kasama work mates nila nag coffee shop nalang sila or something. I didnt buy it but I trust her na wala naman syang ginawang masama. Naiinis lang ako na pinapayagan nya ung lalake na katabi nya around her etc. etc. At ineexplain nya sakin na friend nya naman. Kaso nga nagkagusto sakanya or niligawan sya before like sinama  at inaya sya sa mga dates etc. Kaya di mo maiiwasan na ayoko, kung baliktarin mo naman na ako sumama ako sa dati kong niligawan or nagkagusto sakin matatakot din naman sya..    
  
Kasi ako pwede rin naman na maattract din naman ako sa malapit sakin pero I dont act on it kasi I love her and I respect that I have a girlfriend ayoko naman maging ganon na tipo ng tao. Maraming times na binubugaw ako ng mga lokong kaibigan sa iba pero hindi naman ako pumapayag kasi nga may gf naman ako at mahal ko gf ko.

I lost my job and a long-time friendship over this.  
I used to manage a small coffee shop, had been for years. I hired many of my friends during this, including a roommate/bestfriend of 8+ years. It was going well until a few months ago, I hired another friend. She began conducting herself in an inappropriate way at the job, to myself and other members of the staff. Making sexual jokes, that kind of thing. At first, I shut it down. Eventually our friendship grew - she began inviting me out to bars and back to her place. The flirtatious jokes and humor progressed. She was sober, and I usually was not, so out of politeness (or intoxication), I usually returned the joke or flirty banter.  
After awhile, I asked her upfront if she had feelings for me - she declined to answer. I took the lack of 'yes' as a 'no', which I verbalized, then asked her why she keeps flirting with me - she declined to answer again. I apologized the next day at work for my forwardness. However, her flirting did not stop. The jokes did not stop. She began doing the same thing to another coworker, however this time it was a lesbian in a monogamous relationship. This coworker also returned the flirtations (despite being in a relationship) and they eventually engaged in a sexually-charged interaction. I confronted the girl in the relationship about the nature of their relationship *with her girlfriend present* and things got really bad from there.   
My coworker found out and became irate with me. I attempted to apologize to all three of them for getting involved, but this led to more scorn from the coworker. She tried to get my kicked off of a creative project I founded - it didn't work. This seemed to be the nail in the coffin - the following day, her and the woman in the relationship went to my boss to tell them I am a predator. That I attempted to sexually assault one of them, that I steal from the company, and all other kinds of far-fetched lies. My boss fired me, as he is currently on trial for a sex crime (long story, holy shit) and did not want the bad publicity. He said he did not believe the accusations, however, and has been pretty supportive otherwise.  
The part that hurt most was coming home from my firing to find that my roommate/bestfriend had packed up all of their stuff and left. Just abandoned me.

TL;DR - I got involved with lesbian love triangle drama and now all my friends think I'm a predator!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When designing your living space, comfort and style often go hand-in-hand. One excellent option to consider is the double recliner loveseat. Offering a combination of cozy seating and elegant design, it‚Äôs perfect for modern homes. This piece of furniture can transform your living room into a welcoming hub for relaxation and entertainment.

Here are some of the key benefits you can enjoy when you choose a double recliner loveseat:

- **Enhanced Comfort:** Double recliner loveseats feature ergonomic designs that are specifically crafted to provide exceptional comfort. With plush cushions and adjustable reclining positions, you can easily find the perfect angle to unwind after a long day.
- **Space Efficiency:** Ideal for smaller living spaces, a loveseat takes up less room than a full-sized sofa. A double recliner loveseat offers the benefits of a two-person seating arrangement without crowding your space.
- **Versatile Styles:** These loveseats come in a variety of styles, materials, and colors. Whether you prefer a classic leather look or a soft fabric option, you‚Äôll find a design that complements your existing decor.
- **Reclining Functionality:** Many double recliner loveseats allow both seats to recline independently. This means you and your partner can adjust your seating to suit your preferences, whether you want to sit upright or lean back for a nap.
- **Perfect for Movie Nights:** Imagine snuggling up for a movie night with your loved ones on a comfortable double recliner loveseat. The cozy seated area, combined with the reclining feature, makes it an ideal choice for watching your favorite films together.
- **Easy Maintenance:** Most double recliner loveseats are made with materials that are easy to clean and maintain. Whether you have kids or pets, spills and messes can be easily wiped away, allowing your piece to stay looking great for years.

Investing in a double recliner loveseat means prioritizing your comfort without sacrificing style. Here‚Äôs how you can maximize its benefits in your living space:

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/double-recliner-loveseat  
  
- **Pair it with Coordinating Furniture:** To create a harmonious living area, choose coffee tables, end tables, and accent chairs that blend well with your loveseat. This cohesion sets up a visually appealing space.
- **Use Throw Pillows:** Adding throw pillows can make your double recliner loveseat even cozier. Opt for bold colors or patterns to create a playful contrast, making the loveseat an attractive focal point in the room.
- **Consider the Layout:** Position your loveseat to encourage conversation. Placing it opposite a TV or near larger seating areas invites relaxation and social interaction.
- **Utilize Footstools:** For added leg support, think about incorporating a matching footstool or ottoman. This can enhance the overall experience of reclining even further.

Furthermore, the health benefits of a double recliner loveseat are not to be overlooked. Reclining can alleviate pressure on your back, helping to reduce discomfort during periods of prolonged sitting. If you work from home or enjoy binge-watching shows, this can significantly enhance your personal comfort.

It is also worth noting that a double recliner loveseat can foster bonding moments. Whether you‚Äôre enjoying a lazy Sunday together or hosting friends for game night, its design encourages closeness and shared experiences.

- **Measure Your Space:** Before committing to a purchase, make sure you measure the space where you plan to place the loveseat. Ensure it fits comfortably without overpowering the room.
- **Test Comfort Levels:** If possible, visit a store to test different loveseats. Feel the cushioning, check the reclining mechanisms, and sit for a while to see if it meets your comfort needs.
- **Check for Quality:** Look for high-quality materials that will stand the test of time. Frames made from hardwood are often more durable compared to softwoods.

Choosing a double recliner loveseat brings unparalleled comfort and functional style into your living space. It‚Äôs a fantastic way to create an inviting atmosphere where you can unwind, enjoy quality time, or catch up on your favorite shows, elevating your home experience to new heights.

Tips for Maintaining Your Double Recliner Loveseat for Longevity
----------------------------------------------------------------

Double recliner loveseats are a fantastic addition to many living rooms. They offer comfort and cozy space for relaxation, making them a favorite for families and couples alike. However, just like any other piece of furniture, they require some care and attention to ensure they last for years. By following a few simple maintenance tips, you can keep your double recliner loveseat looking great and functioning smoothly.

### Regular Cleaning

Dust and dirt can accumulate on your double recliner loveseat over time, impacting both its appearance and functionality. Here are some cleaning tips:

- **Weekly Dusting:** Use a soft cloth or microfiber duster to gently wipe down the surfaces. This prevents dirt buildup, ensuring your loveseat remains fresh.
- **Vacuuming:** Utilize a handheld vacuum or an attachment on your regular vacuum cleaner to remove debris from the seams and crevices. Aim for a weekly schedule.
- **Spot Cleaning:** For spills or stains, address them immediately. Blot the area with a clean cloth and a mild fabric cleaner. Avoid scrubbing, as this may harm the fabric.

### Condition the Upholstery

Depending on the fabric or leather of your double recliner loveseat, treating the upholstery can go a long way in maintaining its quality.

- **Fabric Upholstery:** Use a fabric protector to prevent stains. Additionally, applying a suitable upholstery cleaner every few months helps maintain vibrancy.
- **Leather Upholstery:** Leather needs conditioning to keep it from drying out and cracking. Use a leather conditioner every six months to rejuvenate the material.

### Check Mechanisms Regularly

The reclining mechanisms are a critical part of your double recliner loveseat. To ensure they function smoothly, perform regular checks.

- **Lubricate Moving Parts:** Every few months, apply a silicone-based lubricant to the reclining mechanisms. This helps prevent squeaks and stiffness.
- **Inspect for Wear:** Check for any signs of wear or damage. If you notice anything unusual, such as resistance when reclining, seek professional repair before it worsens.

### Protect from Direct Sunlight

Direct sunlight can cause colors to fade and materials to degrade over time. Here are some tips for protection:

- **Reposition Up Against Walls:** If possible, place your double recliner loveseat away from windows or direct sunlight.
- **Use Curtains or Blinds:** Keep curtains closed or use blinds to shield your loveseat from harsh sunlight when you‚Äôre not around.
- **Consider Slipcovers:** For extra protection, invest in slipcovers that can reflect sun rays while also providing an additional layer of defense against dirt and spills.

### Mind the Weight Limit

Every double recliner loveseat has a weight limit. Exceeding this limit can put stress on the frame and mechanisms, leading to potential damage. Be mindful of how many people are using the loveseat at once, and ensure they are within the recommended weight limits provided by the manufacturer.

### Rotate the Cushions

To promote even wear, consider rotating the cushions regularly. This practice helps maintain their shape and prevents one side from becoming too compressed. Aim to rotate cushions every couple of weeks to extend their lifespan.

### Repair Rips and Tears Quickly

Accidents happen, but timely action can prevent small issues from becoming big problems. If you notice any rips or tears:

- **Patch Kits:** Use upholstery patch kits designed for your particular loveseat's fabric.
- **Seek Professional Repair:** If the damage is extensive, consult a professional upholstery service quickly to prevent further damage.

By following these maintenance tips, you‚Äôll enhance the longevity of your double recliner loveseat while ensuring it remains a welcoming and comfortable piece for your home. With regular attention, you can keep it in excellent condition for many cozy evenings to come.

### Conclusion

Selecting a double recliner loveseat can significantly enhance your living space, providing comfort and relaxation suitable for any occasion. Its ability to accommodate two people while allowing ultimate lounging positions makes it a fantastic choice for couples, families, or anyone who loves to unwind. You will create a welcoming atmosphere, encouraging cozy evenings and social gatherings.

I was diagnosed with pelvic floor dysfunction 4 years ago, but my symptoms actually began about 6 years ago. I‚Äôve always been very regular with my bowel movements, usually going right after my coffee without thinking much about it. Then, out of nowhere, I became completely constipated. I had the urge to go but could only pass small, pencil-thin stools and never felt fully empty.

I started seeing doctor after doctor, because constipation seemed to bring on a host of other issues. I developed acid reflux, frequent urinary tract infection-like symptoms (which would disappear once I was able to have a bowel movement), bloating, gas, and hemorrhoids from all the straining. I was miserable.

Finally, in 2020, I was diagnosed with pelvic floor dysfunction. I was referred to physical therapy for about six months (which, unfortunately, wasn‚Äôt covered by insurance, so I ended up spending thousands). I did see improvements and got about 80% better, but I‚Äôve never felt the same since.

I work out and stretch regularly, and I take Metamucil almost every day. Some days are better than others, but I still have to wake up about two hours earlier than usual just to get my bowels moving. I constantly fear that I‚Äôm going backwards, but when I have a good bowel movement, my day feels so much better. I still don‚Äôt feel fully emptied, but it‚Äôs better than it used to be.

I‚Äôm 56 female and recently I started wondering if this could actually be more related to menopause and hormone changes than pelvic floor dysfunction or did menopause cause my Pelvic floor problems? I‚Äôve been reading about hormone replacement therapy and am considering it, as it might help me feel like I‚Äôm back to 100%.

I don‚Äôt experience any pain, which I know is common with pelvic floor dysfunction, so that‚Äôs always been a bit confusing to me. Has anyone had similar symptoms? If so, did you ever recover completely? Would love to hear your thoughts.",1,1731464864.0,PelvicFloor,0,1.0,False

I didn't leave because of issues, I believe in working out things.I wont lie that my desire has always been for us to reconcile but I left because after all the BS I went to my mom's and he did not text or call for 3 days.i could've been in a morgue and he just didn't react.

Had no contact since 2017 and he reached out to me in February 2022, because his father passed. He told me how much his father loved me,  and I went to the funeral since I had no issues with the father. 


It followed with a text of it would be nice to have a coffee to catch up. Coffee turned into consistent contact since January 2023. During the past year and half, he would call, the convos where nice, he even wanted to sit next to me when my dad passed in May this year, buys sex toys, brings food,  text me random etc. 

He had a son and basically was a Covid baby, they broke up shortly after and he TOLD me did everything he had to do to make it work according to him and it was done done. 

During our first encounter after no contact, he never directly apologized for how he did me wrong but said a bunch of things and summed it to the fact that our relationship ended not for lack of love but for been ill equipeded as young individuals in our 20s. He openly said that some things his child's mom did, he know I would never do him like that.

 
Up until September, after our last hookup and him being on me like it was his last day on earth, videocalling, asking me to bring him cake etc, he afterwards proceeds to tell me we're not going to see each other as much. I didn't get it. Later, I deducted that he moved out of his place cause he let slip that he just bought his new patio set, and he didn't even tell me he moved.  He then went on vacation on October, and text me at 2:30am good night beautiful, and when I replied in the  morning, he proceeds to answer: how is my son???? Like WTF??  Like is it me or is it obvious obvious he either moved back with his baby mom.  Yet, you still proceed to engage with me, sleep with me, ask me when am I making you diner?,  good morning I dreamt of you all night, I want to bring the dog to see you, I'm mad at you cause we haven't seen each other in a week etc.
 
He is now slowly ghosting me since, no contact, and didn't even make eye contact the last time we saw each other and I'm here crying like crazy. Instead of one uncomfortable moment to admit and own to his shortcomings, he chooses a lifetime of resentment, rejection and abandonment which is why we broke up. No accountability,  just avoidance even after all this time, it's the all the same.

I spent years trying to heal, went back to school, got my relationship with God, just trying to be better overall and get back to a sense of normal after the divorce but this betrayal this time it hurts so bad. I feel used, like you used me as a rebound, you abused of my forgiveness. Now I just really want him to feel pain like he causes me. I didn't deserve this.

For the past couple months, my sleep has been getting progressively worse. It started with just having trouble falling asleep at my usual time (10:30PM), then it crept to midnight, then 2AM... but now it's gotten completely out of hand.

These days, I try to get to bed by 11PM, but I end up just staring at my ceiling for hours. My body feels exhausted, but my mind refuses to shut down. Up until last week, I was at least managing to drift off by 3AM or so, which wasn't great but I could deal with it.

But this past week has been absolute hell. I'm on my fifth consecutive night of being wide awake until 7AM. When I say wide awake, I mean WIDE awake - like ""just had three espressos"" levels of alertness (which I definitely haven't - I don't even drink coffee after noon). I eventually crash around 7-8AM and sleep until about 11AM, then drag myself through the day feeling like a zombie, only to repeat the whole cycle again.

The most frustrating part? I'll be dead tired at 10PM, but the moment my head hits the pillow, it's like my brain gets a second wind and decides it's party time. I've resorted to just staying up and watching YouTube because lying in bed doing nothing was making me crazy.

I'm a grad student, so I can technically manage with a weird schedule, but I'm falling behind on research and missing morning meetings. My ideal schedule would be sleeping from 11PM to 7AM, but at this point, I'd settle for ANY consistent sleep pattern that aligns with the sun.

Should I try sleep medications? Melatonin? Those sleepy-time teas everyone keeps recommending? Should I pull a 24-hour reset and power through until the next night? I'm desperate for any suggestions at this point.

These courts are spread across the county so I am never physically in the office. I often times do my work at the JP courts, a coffee shop, or my house rather than drive 45-60 minutes to the office. I often have to drive a minimum of 30 minutes to get from one court to the other. So it doesn't make sense for me to leave a court, drive 30 minutes to the office only to be there for 1-2 hours, and drive another 30 minutes to the other court.

For context JP courts are often described as being their own little island‚Äîmy supervisors don‚Äôt have access to the system and don‚Äôt know my schedule, there is no oversight, etc. The cases I deal with are Class C offenses. It‚Äôs very easy and rarely do issues arise (the times an issue has occurred, I‚Äôve contacted my deputy chief immediately and informed her of the situation).

Today my boss denied me a merit raise because I ‚Äúdo not communicate with my supervisors enough.‚Äù However, there isn‚Äôt anything I need to communicate about. And like I said, the times I needed to, I did. So I am not really sure where he is getting this idea in his head. He has never told me that I need to communicate more and never brought this to my attention. He never even gave a speck of a hint that it was an issue.

So I have made the decision to make sure I communicate ‚Ä¶ EVERYTHING! I already plan to email him regarding my docket, the cases that are scheduled that day, the outcome of those cases, etc. Some days, it will be a LONG email and other days it will be many short emails. I may forgot to insert the attachment and have to send another email with the attachment. I will also make sure to bury any truly important information in the middle of the email.

I also plan to ask the secretaries ‚Äúto tell my boss [insert information] next time you see him.‚Äù When he gets used to the emails, I‚Äôll also incorporate some texts if something requires ‚Äúimmediate attention.‚Äù I may also leave a sealed envelope on his desk with a typed out schedule of that week every now and then.

I do need to be cautious about sending unnecessary information because I don‚Äôt want him to use that as a reason to deny me a raise in the future. Knowing this asshole, it's something he would do.

However, this doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs enough. I want to do more!!! So I have decided to come to Reddit to ask for help. Please drop some of the best ideas you have!

TLDR: my boss denied me a raise because I don't communicate enough, so I plan to over communicate every single thing that occurs during my work day

Controversial Prop. 65 warning labels about toxic chemicals are effective, study says

For nearly 40 years, a controversial California law has required companies to place warning labels on their products alerting consumers to the potential health threats posed by chemicals, or else face lawsuits from lawyers, private citizens and advocacy groups.
Passed as a ballot initiative, the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 has resulted in warnings being affixed to everything from vinyl-covered Bibles to gas station pumps, advising that exposure to some 900 chemicals can cause cancer, birth defects or reproductive harm. 
Ever since the passage of Proposition 65, policymakers and business groups have argued over whether the law is effective in preventing people from ingesting and inhaling toxic chemicals, or just providing a payday to plaintiffs attorneys.
Now, a new study published in Environmental Health Perspectives has concluded that Proposition 65 has curbed exposure to toxic substances in California ‚Äî and nationally.
‚ÄúIf you live in California, the warnings are everywhere,‚Äù said Kristin Knox, a senior researcher at the Silent Spring Institute, a nonprofit that investigates the links between breast cancer and chemicals found in consumer products and the environment. 
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre on all sorts of stuff. So it‚Äôs very easy for people to make fun of Prop. 65 because you‚Äôre like, there‚Äôs warnings on my coffee and in my parking garage. But, for us, that made it even more important to be able to go and see if it‚Äôs having effects.‚Äù

Farm pesticides found floating in California air samples; state officials say it‚Äôs OK
California officials insist that pesticide air samples remained within healthy limits. However, environmentalists say the state is downplaying the risk.
Oct. 25, 2024
The study, conducted by Silent Spring and UC Berkeley researchers, suggests the law helped to reduce exposure to toxic substances commonly found in diesel exhaust and plastic materials. 
In order to gauge the law‚Äôs effectiveness, study authors examined the prevalence of chemicals found in blood and urine samples collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The researchers analyzed concentrations of 11 chemicals placed on the Proposition 65 warning list and monitored by the CDC between 1999 and 2016. They included several types of phthalates, chemicals used to make plastics flexible; chloroform, a toxic byproduct from disinfecting water with chlorine; and toluene, a hazardous substance found in vehicle exhaust. 
They found that the majority of samples had significantly lower concentrations of these chemicals after their listing. But the levels didn‚Äôt just decline in California, they fell nationwide. 
However, California residents had lower chemical levels compared to the rest of the U.S., possibly due to more stringent environmental regulations and consumer awareness, according to researchers.
Study authors surmised that the concentrations fell, in part, because businesses removed the chemicals from their goods to avoid warning labels. 
‚ÄúIt sounds like they reformulate to avoid having to put a Prop. 65 label on their product,‚Äù Knox said. ‚ÄúBut when they reformulate, they reformulate nationwide. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre going to make a product just for California. And so this state regulation is actually having a national impact.‚Äù
But swapping one chemical for an unlisted substitute has sometimes resulted in its own consequences. 
For example, when bisphenol A, an ingredient in plastics, was listed in 2013, chemical concentrations in blood and urine samples subsequently fell by 15%. However, that was followed by a 20% rise in bisphenol S ‚Äî a closely related chemical also linked with reproductive toxicity.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what we want to see, and that‚Äôs an argument for regulating chemicals as a class, rather than specific chemicals,‚Äù Knox said.

Port of Los Angeles receives unprecedented $400-million grant to electrify operations
The grant is part of a larger $3-billion initiative to deploy zero-emission equipment at the nation‚Äôs ports, which are significant sources of pollution. 
Oct. 29, 2024
Business leaders have long been skeptical of Proposition 65‚Äôs effectiveness. They argue that the extensive list of chemicals has led to nearly universal warnings, which they say has undermined the law‚Äôs original intent and given consumers warning fatigue. 
Since 2010, companies have settled more than $200 million in Proposition 65-related lawsuits, according to the California Chamber of Commerce. Proposition 65, they say, has resulted in a cottage industry of so-called bounty hunters that target California companies for payouts.
‚ÄúProp. 65 is infamous for its ubiquitous warnings and its bounty hunters who have abused the law to shake down businesses,‚Äù Adam Regele, vice president of advocacy for CalChamber, said in a statement. 
‚ÄúFor many chemicals, it requires warnings at levels 1,000 times below the level known to cause no effect in animal studies. It therefore should come as no surprise that listing a chemical under Prop. 65 prompts businesses to avoid it ‚Äî if they can. The more important question is whether these changes have any public health benefit, and particularly at what cost to consumers.‚Äù
Experts say some of the legal action is warranted and paved the way for reform.
Dr. Meg Schwarzman, a physician and environmental scientist at UC Berkeley, said Proposition 65 has encouraged regulation that has reduced air pollution. Diesel was recognized as a carcinogen and listed under Proposition 65 in 1990. 
Several lawsuits were lodged against businesses, including school bus manufacturers and a major grocery chain. Perhaps the most notable was filed by then California Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, who sued tenants at the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach for failure to warn residents that diesel emissions can cause cancer. 
Not long after its Proposition 65 designation, the California Air Resources Board classified diesel exhaust as a toxic air contaminant, enabling the agency to regulate it. It later adopted a number of rules curtailing diesel pollution in heavy-duty trucks and equipment at ports.
From 1990 to 2014, diesel emissions dropped by 78% in California, compared with 51% nationally.
‚ÄúCalifornians have lower body burdens of many known toxic chemicals than people living outside of here,‚Äù said Schwarzman. ‚ÄúAnd that shows that whatever combination of our environmental laws targeting toxics is having an effect.‚Äù
