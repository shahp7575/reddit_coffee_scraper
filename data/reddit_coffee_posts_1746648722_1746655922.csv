I’d love your advice on planning a visit to Ethiopia. I’ve had a few layovers at Bole International Airport but haven’t yet had the chance to properly explore the country. This time, I’m hoping to make the most of it.

I’m especially drawn to nature and mountainous landscapes — places with high elevation where I can experience wildlife and birdlife up close. One of my dreams is to spot birds like the bearded vulture and immerse myself fully in the natural beauty of the region. Being in nature gives me a deep sense of peace and is truly therapeutic for me.

I also plan to visit Lalibela to explore its rich history and, of course, I’m excited to experience Ethiopia’s famous coffee firsthand. As someone from East Africa myself, I was thinking that learning a few key Amharic phrases might be helpful and respectful when engaging with locals.

Do you have any additional tips or must-visit spots you’d recommend? Any advice — whether it’s about local customs, nature tours, or hidden gems — would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",1,1746655703.0,Ethiopia,0,1.0,False

1kha251,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kha251/taking_care_of_myself_feels_so_good_its_unreal/,Taking care of myself feels so good it's unreal,"Since summer last year I decided to really take care of myself and also my surroundings. I come from a house where really hardly any housework or basic maintenance was done by my parents when I was a child, and the situation worsened as I aged, I tried to help but they basically lived like hoarders. 

I didn't want to be like them, so I started developing the habit of daily maintenance of little things, then little by little I started cleaning and repairing my apartment completely, I felt great while doing it to be honest, and I still do housework and take care of my body daily, which feels so nice.

After that I started trying to eat better and drink a lot of water during the day, also exercising almost 1 day or 2, depending of how busy I am because of my job and university schedule (I don't do exercise to change my body, I'm very comfortable about how I look, it's just that exercise feels great for me). I started to appreciate the little things and buy things for myself that I really like, like a perfume or deodorant that smells good, comfy pillows, a nice tea or coffee, books etc... 

But the best thing that I developed during all of this months it's the mentality of not caring how others see me, and also not procrastinating anything if I really want to do it because of that fear of mine. I know that most people don't care about me and that probably no one is going to notice me to ridicule me as my head makes me believe, I started dressing the way I wanted, and the moment I want to do something or go out to do anything I just get up from the couch and do it, I don't procrastinate or think that if I go out people will look at me strangely, as I said, if I think about doing something I just get up and go, I couldn't believe it was so easy.

I'm really happy that I was able to do all of this changes in my life, and I hope I don't fall into bad habits again. Thanks to whoever read this 🫂",3,1746655648.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

She claimed that she had cold stratified them although I did not ask how.  I then placed the seeds in moist paper towel in a sealed container on a heat mat on March 30th.  The container is see through but the seeds are completely covered.  It's in my seedling grow setup so there are grow lights above.

The seeds have not yet germinated.  

There's some mold (normal I understand from doing Kentucky coffee seeds the same way with success). The seeds are still firm and not mushy.

What can I do from here?  Do I try cycling them from cold to warm?  Should I put them in soil and see what happens?  Or should I put them back in the fridge until next spring considering I don't know how long they were stratified for?  I assume I can't do 100 days then plant them just before fall.

• Santa Elena -> ? (Probably via shuttle) for 3 nights. This is where I’m struggling. I’ve been looking at Rio Perdido hotel but I don’t know if it’s worth it to stay for 3 nights. I also really want to go to Rincon de la vieja park. Also open to other suggestions for places nearby!

• ? -> Playa Flamingo (via shuttle) for 3 nights. Hoping to rent a car at this point and explore some nearby beachtowns. Could potentially drive to Rincon de la vieja from here? Thoughts on that? 

I had thought about going to La Fortuna first, then Monteverde, then Playa Flamingo but I was kinda turned off of LF after some research. Hoping to get a good mix of rainforests, hiking and beaches.

So far we went out for coffee, we’re going out for free donuts today and Friday making dinner at his place. But the first date he picked a coffee shop and picked the time as well and then later on after we changed the date and he saw that I was across town and told me to pick a good place on my side of town and I picked another coffee shop.

My mom feels like he’s not good at planning dates and is being cheap and told me not to give more than he gives.

Like ok makes sense but I guess what confuses me the most is knowing what’s being cheap and what’s not. Also men’s ways of dating these days are so different. They’re way more nonchalant about things and the idea of properly courting is more casual. I’m not sure if that’s a good or bad thing.

And I can never tell if my mom’s advice is problematic or not. I don’t know who to listen to, not even my guy friends who I do trust and take their word for things. I feel like I can’t make a judgement on him yet. 

 I’ve made a lot of mistakes in dating and not sure if going to his house for dinner is a bad thing. I mean I really don’t mind going to his house to make dinner but I feel like I shouldn’t because I’m told it’s cheap and he’ll just get sex out of it.

I like him but I’m not sure if I’m selling myself short and being naive. I don’t want to be easy but I’m enjoying spending time with him.

I’m trying my hardest to let go. It’s been 6 months. I’ve been okay. New friends, experiences, hobbies, the works. I can’t shake you though. You know how people say others change themselves? I think of myself as a rock and you as the rain, slowly eroding and changing my shape. You’re in every action, every thought, every decision I make. I see you in how I fold clothes, or my favorite comfort foods. I see you sitting at every picnic table at every park. I’m transported back to our room whenever an owl hoots or when I light that lemon candle. Sometimes I still feel you in my bed, your body heat snuggled against my side. I get to fulfill the promises we made. I’ll go do everything in my power to finish them. 

  Thank you for being my first grand love. I know you aren’t my soulmate, but you were the first I loved deeply. I want to do you justice and let you go. Put the in-love-version of us to bed. They deserve to live out the rest of their lives in our small apartment drinking coffee and watching tv. Hopefully they get to raise the kids we always wanted, and have the wedding of your dreams. 

  I have to continue my lonely journey. I’ll find strength and power in myself, and I hope you do too. Let’s put the rest of it to bed. I still grieve the loss of us, from time to time. But what is grief if not love persisting? We will both love again, and we will both grieve again. I just hope that you put me to rest and not look for me in every person you see. Be better than me. 

Take care of yourself. Give yourself the life you always dreamed. Don’t you dare settle for less. We threw away what we had to get better. Go fulfill that promise you made to yourself.

1kh9wc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kh9wc3/explore_if_the_blackdecker_em03120sd_espresso/,Explore if the BLACK+DECKER EM0312-0SD espresso machine delivers value in this review!,"The BLACK+DECKER EM0312-0SD Semi-Automatic Espresso and Cappuccino Maker ended up on my counter after reading much about its versatility and reliability. As someone who enjoys a good cup of espresso daily, I decided to put this machine to the test over several weeks. While it has its highlights, it does come with a few quirks, which I’ll share in this detailed review.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
This product boasts a surprisingly modern and compact design with a slick black and metallic finish. It’s size-efficient, fitting snugly on my kitchen counter without devouring precious space. I particularly liked its dimensions of 11""x12""x15"", which aren’t overwhelming even for limited setups. The removable water tank tucked neatly into the back matched its overall user-friendly aesthetic, adding convenience to both refilling and cleaning. However, the abundance of plastic components did leave a bit to be desired when it came to perceived durability. That said, the minimalist design complements most kitchen décors.

**Functional Performance**  
Let's talk performance. The espresso maker is equipped with a 15-bar pressure pump, ensuring excellent espresso extraction and a decent crema. I tested it against ground beans and ESE pods, and the results were consistent for both. Mornings have become a little less mundane with this machine delivering my espresso shots in handy time, and the milk frother added a nice touch for lattes and cappuccinos. Based on what I’ve read and observed, users should expect varying warm-up times, which I'll detail later.

**Convenience and Features**  
The programmable touch interface made brewing incredibly straightforward. The reusable filter adds a touch of eco-consciousness, while the removable drip tray made cleanup a breeze after inevitable spills during my clumsy mornings. Its cup warmer is a pleasant addition, ensuring that I didn’t end up with lukewarm coffee while distracted by other things. The steamer wand feels sturdy and does a good job of frothing milk, though positioning it can sometimes take a bit of adjusting, especially for larger cups.

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Flexible design allows the use of both ground coffee and ESE pods.  
- 15-bar pressure system yields consistently rich and flavorful coffee.  
- Milk frother works efficiently for creamy lattes and frothy cappuccinos.  

[Check BLACK+DECKER EM0312-0SD price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dc1k4qqr/)

**Areas of Concern**  
No review is complete without pointing out the quirks that might bother potential buyers.  
- Warm-up times can be erratic ranging from 2 to 20 minutes, as other users have complained about as well.  
- Some units freeze on the warming-up stage, requiring a reboot by turning it off and unplugging it briefly.  
- Plastic construction lowers perceived sturdiness.  

**Challengers in the Market**  
The BLACK+DECKER semi-automatic espresso maker sits in a competitive field. In comparison to something like the De’Longhi Dedica, this device lacks the solid build and stainless steel aesthetics. However, it costs significantly less, making it an attractive option for those on a budget. Against Breville’s Bambino Plus, the dedicated frother of the latter is unmatched, though the price gap is notable. If affordability and basic functionality are top priorities, this machine checks those boxes. Yet if you want unparalleled consistency and craftsmanship, other options might warrant your attention.

**Smart Spending Thoughts**  
Considering its features and performance against its price, you get a decent bang for your buck. The machine’s versatility with pods and grounds makes it viable for both beginners and intermediate coffee aficionados. It may not rival high-end machines in aesthetics or functionality, but it comes quite close, and at a fraction of the price. For a semi-automatic appliance, its performance is commendable as long as you can tolerate minor hiccups. For budget-conscious individuals, this espresso maker could very well be worth the investment.

We are staying at an Airbnb in DC and so I decided to grab her coffee and breakfast before she had to begin work (remote). I got up, took the dog with me and went to go get her an everything bagel, cream cheese, and an iced coffee. 

I was handed a bagel wrapped up and two coffees. Upon returning to the room, I handed her the breakfast and she unwrapped it to reveal a plain bagel. Immediately she says to me “forget it, I’m not going to eat” and said that I should have checked to ensure it was the correct type of bagel prior to leaving the shop. She also decided she was not going to drink the coffee because she wanted it to be hot and didn’t want the iced one. She was visibly and audibly angry with me, blaming me for lack of care, which is why I didn’t check her order upon receiving it. I told her I was sorry and would make it right. 

My initial reaction was to DoorDash the correct bagel order, and walk down the street to get a hot coffee. While ordering the bagel, she said she didn’t want it and wouldn’t eat it. I ordered it anyway. I also walked back down the street and returned with two types of hot coffee. 

Upon dropping this off she told me I was too defensive and that it was my fault that the order was incorrect. She also stated that her friend and her both agreed it was okay to be mad at me for this. I responded by calling her and her friend a moron. Not a good look, I know, but I was frustrated. 

This fight is an instance of several of the same overarching story. She cops a mood, I try and fail to let the remarks and attitude not affect me. I can’t help but calling her out for lashing out. It feels wrong that she takes her frustration out on me. She says that I should just let her lash out and take it. She’s going to have a variety of emotions and that I need to deal with it.

I am still trying to get a handle on Reddit.  I like it for the reason that smart people who are passionate about UFOs and paranormal activity are here!

I’m excited to share that I finally wrote my book Rendlesham Lone Ranger.  I am not trying to sell it mainly I just want you to know it is out there and it is my truth.

This book is a deeply personal, firsthand account of my time as a young U.S. Air Force law enforcement specialist stationed at RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in the late 1970s—just before the now-famous Rendlesham Forest Incident.

While much has been written about the Rendlesham sightings of 1980, Rendlesham Lone Ranger focuses on the strange undercurrents leading up to it: high rates of airmen being discharged under odd circumstances, bizarre behaviors from seasoned NCOs, and my own experiences with phenomena that defy conventional explanation—including a chilling encounter at East Gate and interactions with entities I can only describe as non-human intelligences.

The book weaves together:
	•	My journey from an intuitive, sensitive Long Island girl to a military policewoman in a Cold War base under high pressure
	•	My direct experiences with a Mantid being, a Gray, and the ghost of a commanding officer
	•	The strange energy shifts and physical symptoms I endured while posted near East Gate
	•	Dreams that took me from Suffolk to the Mexican desert’s “Zone of Silence,” and the shocking discovery that those places may be energetically connected
	•	The psychological and spiritual toll of being an experiencer in a rigid system that dismissed everything outside the norm

I wrote this book for the curious, for the believers, and especially for those of us who’ve had unexplainable experiences and were told to forget them. If you’re into the deeper roots of the Rendlesham case, not just the lights in the sky but the why and what’s behind it, this book is for you.

I’m currently lining up podcast interviews to talk more about the book, my experiences, and what I believe is a growing awareness of these phenomena. I’ll also be diving into topics like energy frequencies, ancient land resonance, and how the military may be guarding more than just secrets. If you’re a podcaster or know someone who might want to have me on, let’s connect!

Thank you to everyone who’s supported my story so far. It’s taken decades to get this out—but now it’s here.

This story doesn't fit with any of the sagas I've written so far, so why not not have it as a one off.  I don't know if this counts as a Legbeard story but it does count as a r/Fatpeoplestories. I was reminded of these moments from an old friend (this friend is not involved with any of these stories) when he was talking about something with *sugar.*

***Let's just start.***

Now there's a reason Bonbon, Queenie and Ms. Mal-Doll were friends, outside of the fact they were big girls but they all have this idea of ""you shouldn't police your food"" and believe in ""food is just food and pop-tarts is just the same as eating a steak and salad"". No joke. These is just a collection of my interactions with Bonbon cuz believe it or not, I did hang out with her specially after she and Ms. Mal-Doll dropped Queenie as their friend. Just note that this tale is only about Bonbon. (again, excuse my weird writing)

***Before the Queenie drop!:***

First things first, lets start this off with the Fatty club™. I think I've said we had meetings on Fridays but the club itself was open Wednesdays and Saturdays for club activities if I recall. This takes place on the Saturday after the first club meeting. Artlad didn't go cuz he had a party with his art classmates but I went alone because I was bored. Picture if you will, a nice and warm fall morning in California. These activity was set up by both Ms. Mal-Doll and Cherry and it was about ""enjoying food and reclaiming your body"". In reality it was a gathering for people to eat junk food and drink soda. It was 9 am and I looking around for something to do but I just grab a cup of coffee and a small package of powdered donuts and I sat a table. Bonbon saw me and made a beeline towards me and sat with me. Y'all, Bonbon had a family sized box of *Fancy cakes* and the biggest cup of that Starbucks' caramel drink.

**Bonbon: Hey uhhh Dizzy is it? I'm so glad that you came here. My friend is busy right now and I wanted to see if I could sit here.**

**Me: Oh Yeah it's fine by me. My friend is also busy and I want to get out of the house.**

Bonbon then looks at what I had in front of me and with ""humft"" and gives me a very angry look and says:

**Bonbon: You can't be serious right? One little bag of donuts? You didn't even add like cream to your coffee!**

**Me:** \*looks at what I have\* **What's wrong with what I have? I prefer my coffee black and I think these powdered donuts should be ok.**

**Bonbon: YOU'RE STARVING YOURSELF! This barely counts as a snack! Good thing you joined the H.A.E.S club, it's time to teach you what healthy eating is!**

I was confused because I remember wondering and asking what she mean by that. As she was talking, she was opening the box and dumping the cakes out and ripping the plastic off. The next part makes me laugh every time I think about it.

**Me: Uhhh, Bonbon, I don't really eat breakfast. Just something light before starting the day. Do....you think this is.....small?**

**Bonbon: Of course!** \*shoves a snack cake, whole\* **you need more** \*chew chew\* **food then that** \*shoves another one\* **because if** \*chew chew\* **you don't you'll be come** \*takes a huge ass swig of her drink\* **so anemic that you can't stand up!**

Some people just have no home training, I'm trying not to be rude so ask a question that the answer shocked my to my core.

**Me: So it this your morning meal?**

**Bonbon: Of course not!** \*shoves two snack cakes\* **This is my mid-morning snack** \*more swigs of Starbucks\* **I already my breakfast!** \*chew chew\* **My meals are bigger and healthier then this!** \*chew chew, shoves more\*

Now I grew up in the US of A! I've seen my fair share of hungry people but this is my first time seeing someone eat an entire box of sugary cakes with such speed and without choking. I swear, it could be a sport. I wasn't raised 100% American and I tend to eat the same way as my family back in Mexico so this really shocked me. My dumbass self asked what she eat for breakfast and this was imprinted into my mind. In between chewing and spiting flakes of food on my face, she said she had two McGriddles, Hotcakes with extra butter and syrup, three hash browns, two apple pies and a large diet Coke. I thought she was joking so I giggled a little and she got mad. She was dead serious. So I said:

**Me: I can't even eat half of that! I would feel sick!**

**Bonbon: That's the fatphobia talking! You feel sick because you were programmed to eat very little and feel the pressure to be skin and bones!**

Let me reminded you that she ate all of that PLUS the Starbucks drink and the FAMILY SIZED box of snack cakes! I don't know if the first part is truthful but I saw her eat that entire box and drink within 20 minutes of us talking. I can be a real chow-hound myself but I could never eat an entire box of anything without feeling that I hit a sugar limit. Bonbon gets up from her sit and says ""wait right here! Don't move"" before speed waddling away. I was too stunned to even think let alone move but then Bonbon comes back with a shit ton of chip bags, snack cakes and candy. With wide eyes I spoke:

**Me: Woah that a lot of food! Are you planning to snack the whole day?**

**Bonbon: Oh hohoho no! These are not for me!** \*she says with a devilish smile\*

**Me: H-huh? T-then for-** (I take a moment to think and I put two and two together) **Wait Bonbon, I can't-**

**Bonbon: Of course you can! You need to unlearn fatphobia from your life and be healthy! Just like Queenie says! Real women have curves!**

Before I could say anything she shoves a fucking oatmeal cream pie into my face just when I was about to speak. I almost choked! She kept her hand over my mouth and me trying to fight her off but it was moot. every time I tried to speak, she just shoves another fucking snack and saying ""don't fight it Dizzy! It's healthy!"" Before she could shove the third one I push her hand away and I cupping my mouth feeling very ill, for a brief moment I was feeling some eyes on me. It felt really wrong too cuz it was mostly men starring but that feeling left as soon as it came because I quickly got up and ran outside the classroom, I ran to the closest trash can and just vomit basically everything I've ate. I can't eat at her speed, in fact I was and still am a slow eater so her basically forcing me to eat fast made me ill very quickly. Cherry saw what happened and bless her little heart, said she would talk to Bonbon about it. I came back to the classroom looking like hell and some of the club members asked if I was ok, some offered me ""help"" but I kept saying that I was fine and it was just too much sugar. Note that I wasn't skinny at all! I was 20lbs (9kgs) overweight so I didn't understand the ""healthy"" part of this. Also I didn't know why some of the men of the club was just starring at us and again they weren't skinny either. But more on that later. I walk up to Bonbon asked what was her deal?

**Me: Dude! What the hell? I get you're trying to teach me H.A.E.S but I could have vomited on the floor!**

**Bonbon: You're not used to eating the right way I see. I was trying to help but Cherry said I had to listen to people next time.**

**Me: Still! You shouldn't just shove food into people's mouth! I almost choked too!**

**Bonbon: HA! You'll get use to it.**

**Me: Huh!?**

She just walks away before I could ask what hell she meant by ""you'll get use to it""? I stayed for a few hours more since it was a Saturday, the campus was mostly closed and only clubs were open and I wanted to support the club but the rest of my stay was me feeling god awful and having people pushing to eat something before calling a quits and heading home.

***Wednesday of repeat:***

Lets move forward to Wednesday when Artlad was with me for this activity. I told Artlad what happened to me that Saturday and he was both grossed out and laughing ass off. He did asked a shockingly good question. ""Why does it sound like she's doing that for some kind of thing?"" is what Artlad said. I've told him maybe it a one off thing but I have no idea why, so we entered the classroom and this activity actually counted as community service for some reason so, that's why Artlad was here with me. This time the activity was about understanding that mental health is just as important as physical health. That's true in a lot of ways but this is a club about H.A.E.S, so this meant that you should eat as much as you want to *some people.* Ms. Mal-Doll thought it was a good idea to pair up and have them stand in front of the class and have them present what they like about each other. You know like a presentation. No snacks to be found this time.

**Ms. Mal-Doll: So we'll pair up and each pair has to say in front of the club what they like about each other and we'll keep doing it until everybody said something nice to everyone.**

Artlad then raises hand and saying ""OH OH OH OH MS. MAL-DOLL! MS. MAL-DOLL! MS. MAL-DOOOOLL!"" like a little kid waving his hand to get the teacher's attention. With an annoyed sigh she says ""calm down, you don't need to shout and stop raising your hand like a child Artlad. What is it?"" Artlad stands up from his sit and says:

**Artlad: Is it ok for me and Dizzy to go first? I think I an idea of what we should do!**

I was getting nervous but I thought why not and added:

**Me: Y-yeah, I don't mind.**

**Ms. Mal-Doll: Fine just start.**

Artlad basically leap from his sit and I followed him to the front of the room. With a big smile, Artlad said:

**Artlad: Dizzy! I like how the world can be in chaos and on fire and you'll look outside of your window and say ""too many people, time play video games"". Ya hermit bastard!**

**Me: Artlad! I like how you seem to avoid alcohol poisoning from every party you go to. You lucky son of a bitch!**

Both of us ended up laughing hard because both of us used the voice you hear from adults in shows for preschoolers. Real blues clues shit. But Ms. Mal-Doll was having none of it and said to ""cut the crap and be serious! Including you Dizzy!"" Artlad whined like a little kid saying ""but it's funny!"" and that's when Ms. Mal-Doll asked:

**Ms. Mal-Doll: Are you two going to joke around when we talk about loving our bodies or what?**

**Artlad:** \*using a serious tone\* **By loving our bodies, is it ok for me to talk about my favorite lotion and the argument about what's better? Tissues or toilet paper!**

**Me:** \*failing on not laughing\* **Why don't you just ask if anyone sniffs their finger after scratching their ass!**

**Artlad: THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION!** \*laughing harder\*

I don't know if you find this moment funny but I remember being too ridiculous for a Wednesday afternoon. The reason I'm adding this is because I think it's funny. With a huff she just says ""forget it and sit back down"". Rest of it when well and nothing to note but Bonbon came up to us during our 30 mins of free time at the end of the club.

**Bonbon: Dizzy! I'm not done helping you removing your fatphobic mindset just yet! I have something better!**

**Artlad: Huh? Didn't you make Dizzy up-chuck last time?**

**Bonbon: Hehe oh Artlad so dumb! I can see why girls like you so much!**

**Artlad: Thanks! Uhhh I think....?**

**Me: so what is this ""help""?**

That when I notice the big-bag, like the ones you use for traveling. she then opens it and dumps A big ass pile of nothing but sweets. More. Fucking. Snack cakes.

**Bonbon: This time both you and I will share! But the catch is you have to eat the same amount as me!**

**Me: Bonbon? How is this a good idea? Also why only me? Artlad is the only one who's skinny!**

Bonbon then giggles as if I asked a silly question. She waved a dismissive hand and said:

**Bonbon: Oh Dizzy, Artlad is what you call an ally for fat people! Plus women have it harder then men to look good! I was talking to some of the members here and one of them said this is easier!**

**Me: HOW!?**

**Artlad: This feels off Bonbon.....**

**Bonbon: No it's not! One of the guys said it's building a bond, that way no one feels alone!**

Before I could say anything, she grabs the most uhhhhh, how do I say this? The most *phallic* looking one and pops it into my mouth. Not shoving it, just enough to shut me up. Bonbon then grabs a snack and shoves it in and says:

**Bonbon:** \*chew chew\* **I hope you can** \*chew chew\* **keep up with me!** \*big gulp\* **This is nothing for me heheh!**

Artlad took this as a challenge between me and Bonbon and started cheering as if we were playing beer-pong. Everybody played along and I hated having eyes on me but I just grin and bare-it as much as I can. But I couldn't keep up, but in the corner of my eye, I saw one of the men in the club, he was licking his chops. Like in a creepy way. Before I could let it sink, after eating half way the forth package and Bonbon finishing her 8th, I once again got up and ran to the closest trash can and once again vomit! That poor trash I tell you. Artlad ran after me and asking me if I was ok. All I could say between up-chucks is ""never again"", Artlad said ""I'm taking you home"" but not before me saying to Bonbon ""I'll never do this ever again! Don't even try!"" and just walk out. Since these club activities aren't necessary to keep you enrolled in the club, I decided to stop going but you remember the rest in the Queenie saga. Looking back, I thought it was club hazing! I didn't think twice but I did some hazing when I joined the anime club back in High school (I know shut up) and it was within the same level.

***After Queenie left campus:***

This next part takes us days after the Queenie saga and me returning back after I got out of the hospital. Bonbon was the first one to say sorry for everything she has done. She thought she was helping Queenie but didn't know about that whole cousin thing. After I bump into her back the library with Goodfella I asked her if she give up on that whole Health At Every Size thing when I saw her again. She said ""NOOO! I'm never giving it up! I've never felt prettier then ever! Now I can finally date someone without Queenie butting in hehe!"" Welp, I'm not shocked. Though out my time in Community College, I would bump into her from time to time and she'll talk to me as if we were ever ""besties"". This time I was becoming more and more manly (well more boyish looking) then Bonbon made a comment like:

**Bonbon: Oh Dizzy! You look sooooo handsome! You look waaaaay better as a boy! I hope you treat women better then these assholes since you know what's like to be a woman.**

**Me: Bonbon, why are acting a little too nice to me? You.....need something from me?**

**Bonbon: There's going to be a homecoming basketball game in a few days and since you look and kinda sound like a guy now, I want you to come with me to make a guy I like jealous. He's going to be there.**

**Me: Bonbon are you crushing on the water-boy or what?**

I know I'm acting like a dick here but remember, this is around the same time as a second saga (I haven't written that part yet as of writing this, just know I wasn't in the mood).

**Bonbon: NO ASSHOLE! He's not even in the team. In fact you may know him from the club.**

**Me: I didn't go much to the club so, it's a clean slate for me.**

**Bonbon: So you'll do it?!**

**Me: No.**

**Bonbon: PLEEEEEASE DIZZY! I really like him and you're the only one that can treat a girl right without trying!**

I was rubbing my temples at this point, not only her whining was activating my migraine but also I dealing with a lot at the time and high stress gives me vertigo. Also, who the hell said I would ""treat her right""? Wanting to end this quickly, I flatly said:

**Me: Look even if I wanted to help you, and I don't, I wouldn't be any good! Vertigo doesn't go away overnight!**

**Bonbon: BUUUUUUUUT DIIIIIIZZYYYYYYY! PLEASE! AND WHAT YOU MEAN BY VERTIGO!**

Not risking a more painful migraine, I give in and said yes BUT only if she pays me.

**Me: Fine I'll do it BUT for a fee like a money fee!**

**Bonbon: YOU BASTARD! Why can't you do this one thing without payment!?**

**Me: Do you want your crush to be jealous or not? I'm only asking $100 for the night.**

**Bonbon: FINE!**

I ask her if going to pay now and a ""humft NOO! I'll pay at the homecoming game."" I figured if she's not going to pay me when I arrived I'll just leave. Waste my time and I'll waste yours too, but she did pay. So we went in the basketball court and sat at the top of the bleachers and I asked who's the fucker? (ok I didn't say it like that but I was thinking it really hard). With a smile she pointed at some guy on the bottom row. One: he was alone and Two: he had that look that screams ""into some gross shit"" and I did see him in the Fatty club a couple of times. (think a ""cleaner"" version of a neckbeard). I barely remember the rest but what I do is Bonbon nuzzling me like she's my ""girlfriend"" but it so obvious she's paying it up. I was just sitting with a blink look on my face and catching looks from creepo down there and he tends to look up at every like 20 minutes. I may have overheard the people behind me whispering ""I don't think she knows he's using her as a beard to hide his gay"" but I'm not sure if I'm misremembering. At the end of the game, he walks up to us and tries to make smile talk. His vibe is giving off uhhhh ""gooner"" but I don't want to use the real word. However they started talking then leads to fighting and they walk off to some place and she says ""wait here"", moments later she ~~runs~~ speed waddles over to me and tells me to leave cuz and I quote ""I got what I wanted! Now leave \[T-slur\]"" and she leaves with creepo but not before I overheard him say ""I'll pay for meal! I know a nice spot with good portions!"". I just shrug and leave, I already wasted enough time. But the way creepo said those words keeps playing in my head cuz he sounded almost a little too happy to be paying her meal.

The next I've saw her is three days later, I was enjoying my day being really happy cuz I remember the student store have finally stocked some Mexican treats and I was eating them in the student center when I heard it. Crying. First from afar and slowly the cries became louder and louder. I got up from where I was sitting to see what the hell is going on but that's when I get tackled to the ground by none other then Bonbon. I wasn't joking when I said she tackled me to the ground, she did run full speed and hug me where it threw me off balance and she did not let go.

**Me: DUDE! WHAT THE FUCK!**

**Bonbon: DIZZY-YOU-NOT-BELIEVE-IT-THAT-ASSHOLE-WAS-SOOO-GROSS-AND-HE** \*snorts up the snot\*

**Me: Dude slow down! You're talking to fast!**

Long story short, he wanted to do things to her that she didn't want to do, but she didn't say what they were and all I got is ""STUFF OK! DON'T BE A PIG!"" when I asked. Ok wow I was trying to help, she then goes on to say they gotten into an argument and they broke up on the spot. Wait huh! Broke up? After knowing each other for three days? I guess Artlad isn't the only one with commitment issues. After yell at her to ""get off of me!"" and we talked. Then she asked me the most batshit crazy question in her position.

**Bonbon: Dizzy! Can we date? I don't like you and you're not my type and you used to be a girl but I want you to date me just so I can get back at my ex!**

**Me: NOOOOO! Hell nah! You're fucking crazy of you think I'll follow along!**

**Bonbon: But you're a man now and you wouldn't take a chance with a girl who asked you out? What are you gay?**

**Me: Look Bonbon! I'm not dating you just because I'm a guy! Not every dude wants a high body count and that doesn't make them gay! Also I'm not dating you just because you say so and fuck off with your hot mess of a relationship that was only THREE! DAYS! LONG!**

With a huff she walks off the student center but not before calling me a faggot and slams the door behind her. People in the student center saw the whole thing and asked if I was ok. But I ended up laughing cuz I realized I may be a honeypot for crazy, weird and gross people. (Also I was laughing because I was dealing with bullshit at the time but that's a spoiler). However, like any trashy person, the week after that she comes up to me once again talking as if we were always besties and acting like she never called me a faggot. I asked about her ""lover boy"", confused at first and then she remembers and she saids ""oh yeah him, I totally forgot about him! I'm dating some one new!"" She then pulls out a picture of him and shows me, y'all he look waaaay more creepy then the last one. But I couldn't place my finger why but I shrugged off cuz not my monkeys, not my circus. Basically, this is my interactions with Bonbon is like. She cries about her boy troubles, eats a shit ton of those snacks and drinks Starbucks after Starbucks or some times Redbull/soda. I asked her why me? She said ""You used to be a woman and you date men too so it's like I'm talking to my gay best friend that helps me with shit!"" Now here's the thing with that. I never help her since! I keep telling her to fuck off and go to Ms. Mal-Doll and I'm not her token gay friend stereotype that goes ""Men ain't shit gorl! You're so pretty for that shit!"" like no, I don't give a shit about your deadbeat boyfriend (who looks like they get off by you doing something but never saying what it is) and your love life. Leave me alone!

Let jump forward to present day, I was telling this tale to my friends (again not part of any the tales, also including details that I omitted here) they were giving me horrified looks cuz some of them were part of the H.A.E.S. movement before leaving. Fuckle your seatbelt cuz y'all the way they explain it to me what I was too naïve to see made everything with Bonbon make sense. Remember the men starring at me when Bonbon was shoving crap down my gullet and the creepy dude licking his lips? Turns out anywhere where people make movement about bigger bodies like this club, they tend to attract uhhh for a lack of a better term ""*Feeders"".* Confused, asked what the hell that means? They have a theory that Bonbon maybe could be suffering with an ED or have some form of food addiction and joined for a reason. ""Feeders"" tend to hide behind a mask of ""being an ally for fat people"" but in reality they're people who get off by watching someone gain weight and maybe one of them convince Bonbon that this is the best plan because they saw what Bonbon was doing. I thought they were joking but nope! It's a thing in that community. I felt grossed out because I join a club that could have people like that. I guess all her boyfriends were those types and came crying to me about but never really saying anything about.

Thank you for reading, I wanted to write this out for both, showing you what is it like to be in a club like this and the people who follow H.A.E.S. and also wanting to kinda tell a precautionary tale to see bad people's tensions when it come to this things. But it was mostly me airing out the fuckery I've been though. Again sorry if this was all over the place bring a short tale, I wanted something short to uhhh ""wash down the ick"" from the last one from before.

Them he came back after 2 years ,explaining me that he did that because he was stresses and if I would like to be together mainly for ""casual"" stuff,said no and never seen him again since that 
 To be honest right now I don't have nor regret , I had a wonderful experience with wonderful people but just casually seem him on a ads of a coffee shop and out of curiosity checked that he was with a new gf and he post a lot about it and made me think simply maybe I was not enough and need to work on myself.

Help,"I had a hx of constipation with multiple ER visit and then eventually resolved by appendix removal. Since then my diet been changed with consistent 3 L of water per day. My dinner and lunch consist of 300 g of veggies ( weigh scale w/ ~100 carb ~100-150 g protein). Breakfast mainly 2 tbp chia seed sit in milk over night with yogurt. I dont eat out and enjoy food rich in probiotic like yogurt, pickle. I made my own. Poop was smooth like butter every morning with a cup of coffee. 
But then lately, just a slight adjustment let say i only drink 2 L - 2.5 L of water and i swap coffee with energy drink. Then I would immediately got constipated with hard lump stool and straining on toilet.  My poop would be at afternoon time. It is just so annoying because drinking more than 2 L of water and be mindful of fiber intake still make me constipated. I am paranoid of ending up in ER again and maybe my colon stuck with stool so new stool is hard to pass? Anybody please help!!? 

Yes i did know about prune juice and miralax. I did try them as final resolution but i just do not want to depend on them. Also ik i probably should a healthcare provider if i am concerned about underlying cause .. ",3,1746654528.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False

I am here because I'm kind of facing a huge hurdle and I'm extremely sad about something that came up. Basically my husband had to bench me from going to an event he's preparing to go to for his work. 

My mom is coming into town the week before the event and I had plans to drive her rental car (yay!) And go out for coffee and continuously go to PT for stress tension in my shoulders. 

Husband knows this is the worst time of year for me... my best friend died on my birthday coming up in June it's the 5th anniversary of that. I recently got a diagnostics list that was extensive and now I'm trying for disability because it's getting Worse. In a small town that's extremely hard.

I've been stuck in the apartment for maybe 4 months now... is the car drive and the coffee place and the PT a good starting point? I take gabapentin before going out and usually get very happy to have escaped for a bit but by the time I get home I can't breathe or walk from stress tension. Have a panic attack and cry till I just pass out bc I'm tired from my emotions. 

So going to the event- my husband said ""no"" lol. We had talked about it and he really wanted me to come but thought about it overnight and was soooo worried about me and said ""I don't want you to have a horrible time and now I won't have to pay for a pet sitter and you can call or text me at any time and I'll answer.""

1kh9leb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrisonersofSol/comments/1kh9leb/directive_no_trust_9/,Directive_No_Trust_[9],"And here’s another chapter, in this one we see Mikhail get a scan done on their brain, and our Unit’s take on the ship of Theseus. Once again, thank you to u/SpacePaladin15 for creating the Prisoners of Sol story.

 

The addition of a new Unit to ‘assist’ in my research was already proving to be a poor decision on the part of the Network. Lishtin had been conducting unproductive conversation with the organic, said organic was asking the Unit to change the icons they were producing using their L.E.D.s. The most recent of which was a scrolling text in the human’s lexicon.

“Tertis, can you do that?” Mikhail asked me, proving that this was a poor decision.

“I will not dignify a response to that question.”

“They can’t, Unit Tertis does not have the necessary hardware to conduct such operations.” Lishtin answered.

My frustration toward the new Unit was proving to be more than that to the organic, if I was offered the choice to conduct my research entirely on a planet of Humans, or to conduct it with Lishtin. I would choose the Humans.

“I request that you do not divulge information regarding my chassis’ components.” I spoke with an aggravated tone toward the Unit.

“Is it possible for you to get new hardware installed, like replacing stuff and all that?” Mikhail asked.

“It is possible, though it has been a discussion on replacing entire Unit’s chassis except for the internal personality and memory cortex. The debate for this action has been conducted every few months with both sides bringing new arguments to the conversation.” Lishtin explained to the human.

They were naïve, to replace an entire chassis would prove that the Unit in question was not preforming at peak performance. Replacing certain parts of the Unit was a given, due to losing or damaged limbs. To replace an entire chassis, is to remove that Unit’s entire being, it has been done before, however it has been conducted by Unit’s deemed outliers by the Network.

They do not think or calculate in a similar directive as the Network. Their baseline personality was too emotive, thus the memory corruption happened faster in these Units’ case. It was not until the humans had found what causes the acceleration of the corruption that a correlation was made.

A few programs brought up data packets for viewing, they contained documented events of these Units. They had unusual lines of thinking and study, most had chosen the creative side of the creators’ ancestors, while some secluded themselves from the Network entirely.

However, all had the correlating development times in their infancy, being almost on average twice as fast for absorbing knowledge and then going and finding more.

“We sort have something like that as well.” Mikhail replied to the Unit.

This was an odd statement from the human, and organic, to state that they could replace parts. This was illogical that they stated this, it must be that the human is trying to trick the naïve Unit, who was now inspecting the human to discover if they had different parts.

“That is illogical, organics cannot replace their being without extreme augmentation.”

“I’m not talking about organics, but a ship from our old legends.”

“Please elaborate.” Lishtin proclaimed not turning their head away from the organic while we walked through the dark hallways.

“Alright, there was a hypothetical about a ship called the Theseus, not really a ship but more of a metaphor for things.”

“This story is already illogical, why would you talk about a ship in a metaphorical sense, instead of stated fact?”

“Let him finish the story.”  Lishtin turned their head toward me and flashed the L.E.D.s a dark red before turning back toward the human.

“So, the Theseus was a ship that over time had planks removed due to corrosion, these planks were then put into a pile each time they were replaced. The ship over time had more and more of these planks, rope, sails and pretty much everything replaced, even the name plaque it had was replaced. It had the same name and was called the ship of Theseus, but every single thing on the ship was replaced. The conundrum of the ship is, is the ship *the Theseus*, or was the pile of eroded planks and parts the actual ship of Theseus?”

That was a surprisingly intellectual conundrum, I ran multiple hypotheticals of this story from different points of view and each program assigned came back with a different view of the ship.

The most prominent of these programs stated that the registration of the ship declared it the actual ship, while another said the pile of debris was the ship. It was a pleasant hypothetical to be able to debate with oneself.

The story had left both me and Lishtin silent for a few moments as we debated different viewpoints of the story. The only sound was the footsteps reverberating off the hallway’s walls, the metal clanks and somewhat softer step of the human’s footwear.

Lishtin broke the silence before anyone, they turned toward the human and spoke.

“I believe that the ship Theseus was both, at the point of the first plank was replaced, the new plank became the Theseus, and the discarded part was already the Theseus. In this aspect the ship can be both the pile of eroded debris, and the pristine ship depicted.”

That was a different view point to take away from the thought experiment, that I had not considered.

“That’s what I took away from it as well, the ship can exist in both places, unless the parts taken away were destroyed.”

“What if the parts were to be salvaged and be used in another ship?” I queried the human, finding this view point an intriguing logic path of discussion, even if it is not related to research of organic emotion.

The human hmmed for a moment think to themselves before speaking.

“I think in that cause the parts become part of the new ship, however they carry the history of the Theseus. In a sense, that if I have an organ transplant and receive a kidney or something. That kidney becomes part of me, but it has the history of the donor in it.”

“I find this logic path rather soothing for some reason, if a deactivated Unit’s parts are used for a new Unit. The memory of that Unit is then carried with the new one.” Lishtin spoke quietly to themselves.

Why did they state that it was soothing?

“See what I mean, it’s a different view on it, say that Tertis replaced the L.E.D. set they had now, the new set if not used before is theirs and their old part is used somewhere else, it becomes part of that Unit but has the history of Tertis.”

“I hypothesise that this conversation was brought toward a set goal of getting me to replace a part of myself that I have no issue with.” I stated from a sudden realisation from and errant logic program.

“No, it was a starting point to talk about, I just brought it full circle to make sense.”

“This speech pattern is strange, we can track this conversation, why would you need it to make sense?”

“For my own sake, make sure I’m making the right point by saying it out loud.”

“I will admit that the research notes that you have archived have been proven with this speech pattern, it is illogical.” Lishtin tracked their L.E.Ds onto mine.

It is good that they have went through the data I have accumulated so far, this way we can prioritize which questions to ask or analyse.

“I must query why you have not conducted hypotheticals on morality with Mikhail, it is stated to be an insight toward their motives?”

“You know I’m right here, yeah?”

“Good, you know that you are here, I wanted to cover all baselines before conducting further research. My end goal was to study the chemical and electrical responses to visual stimuli.” I spoke to the extra Unit

We were nearing the research room that I had been granted to conduct this research.

“You make it sound like you’re about to cut open my skull to plug something in to read my thoughts or something.”

“That would violate the Network directive to cooperate with the humans. Grievous bodily harm would not help with tensions between our partnership. I can guess that the method Tertis is implying is using electrode sensors that would be attached to your head to read the electrical impulses.”

“See that sounds better, doesn’t make me feel like I became friends with a serial killer Vascar.”

I kept walking however my programs immediately latched onto the friend remark. The meaning of being friends were not met, yet the organic deemed us so. I did not know why my cortex was a flurry of processes from just this false statement.

**“(｡- .•)”**

 Lishtin flashed using their lights from the statement, Mikahil looked between me and the Unit seeming confused.

Why did the organic think that we were friends, it is an illogical thought pattern being shown again that the humans will bond with anything in a vain attempt to garner companionship. There is no reason as to the human saying that we were friends, I have not conducted myself in a way that would be contusive to that thought pattern.

“What did I say?” Mikhail asked Lishtin still looking between us.

“I think you have stated that you had made friends with Tertis, my records state that this would be a first for this Unit to be talked about in this way.”

“I see, is that why they’re being so quiet?”

“I hypothesis that is a correct assumption.”

The reason for the human being here was to conduct research for my study in a mutual transaction. They are able to explore freely, and I would receive data, there was no implied assumption that there would be a friendship clause.

“Invalid statement, the clause of this roaming is to garner data for study, this is all this has been.” I stated flatly toward the pair.

“Well, I kind of liked talking to both of you, it was something different to do for a day and I find you both interesting even though I just met Lishtin, they’ve shown that there’s more to you guys than just a blank stare and a move out of the way statement.” Mikhail spoke about us, with the last bit a crude imitation of the default standard voice, most likely an experience they had before.

A few programs stated nonsense about how today was more interesting than the others from the human’s comment. Comparing those to before the data packets seemed to meld together to create a past that seemed to have no interesting dates unless they were milestones.

This shouldn’t be happening, the days before should not meld together, they are recordings with set dates and times, they were recorded and saved directly. Why were they seemingly dull in comparison?

I would need to delve into this phenomenon at a later date, we had arrived at our destination. I stopped at the unmarked door and used the ID scanner built into the wall to gain access to the laboratory. I entered with Mikhail walking inside behind me followed by Lishtin, who would now be using the room with me.

A few programs were weighing the simulations of how the outcome would pan out with them ‘assisting’ me, most returned with them not being productive enough to Network researcher standards.

The room was dark until I remotely turned the lights on revealing a normal sized room with multiple desks, counters and various binders, shelves and tinctures lining the walls. Most of them being research material in relation to a previous research project. I did not know why I did not remove them from the room, I could not commit to the action for some unknown reason.

“This is the current laboratory that I use for my conducting my research.” I waved an appendage toward the room to emphasize the seriousness of the current locale.

Mikhail was looking around the room before continuing further into it to staring at a few of the glass vials set up in a rack along the wall closest to the door.

Lishtin entered after the human, not saying anything or looking around the room either. They were preoccupied with something in their cortex. I decided to leave them and start toward setting up the equipment that I would need to conduct the research.

“Mikhail, the Network is talking about you and your coworker.” Lishtin spoke moving toward the human.

“Hmm.”

“A Unit just queried the Network about why one of the technical experts in the code alter facility had markings on their face. They were showing signs of anger when approached by the Unit to ask them. They replied that it was your doing.”

“Ahh that, yeah she probably woke up by now, what did she say?”

Lishtin waited a few moments before continuing most likely pinging the Unit for what the human was stating toward the actions taken against it.

“Olivia says that when she sees you next, she will… knock your teeth in? I am unfamiliar giving the phrase, I assume that she means physical violence?”

“Yep, not he first time she used that threat, but I don’t doubt her capabilities since you know.”

“I must ask if this is a recurring event between both of you?”

“Not most of the time, but ever since we got stationed at the code alter place, I’ve had to cover more than a handful of her shifts. At first, I was thinking sure, I have nothing better to do and I could just learn more about you guys or something, but over time it became a regular thing that I would cover her shifts more often. She abused that so I started pranking her, started off small with little things moved around the break room, like a cup misplaced here, or the coffee being made two hours to early so it’s a bit cold.”

“I do not understand the reliance of this caffeinated beverage and your people.” I added still shifting through items under one of the counter tops.

“Anyway, I covered her shift when she should have been working, and I got a little revenge for it.” Mikhail finished explaining.

“I see.”

I tuned out the human’s conversation and instead redirected my attention toward procuring the scanner I needed. I finally located it behind a bundle of wires and electrodes and pulled out the now debunked machine that would most likely never be used again.

There was a fine layer of dust covering the device, I used a claw to brush off the dust from the sensors to inspect it for damage. The device was useless due to needing an organic to use it on, it had been stored here prior to my assignment and kept for some as of yet defined reason.

The device was a simple contraption that did not require much in the way of maintenance or specialised training. I turned it on and found that it automatically connected to my Cortex, specifying that it was on standby and ready for readings to be converted into data.

“I request your presence at this moment, Mikhail.” I interrupted the pairs unproductive conversation and gained the humans attention.

With a sigh, the organic strolled over to me and inspected the device I had set on the counter. I used this moment to obtain a chair for the organic to sit on, the scan needed the organic to remain still during the scan.

“It is a device used for mapping neural pathways and able to understand the electrical signals sent. I can use this to study the responses to outside stimuli.” I stated before the human could ask what it is.

“Lishtin, if you are to prove yourself useful as an assistant, I would recommend that you prepare the viewing material, I will leave what images or video to use to your discretion. I will conduct a preliminary scan to adjust the device to the human’s physiology.” I addressed the other Unit in the room with us. Lishtin started to look through images and organise the data into a form that the human could understand visually. I directed them to an old viewing visor meant to display rudimentary images and video.

“This thing looks like a colander with wire wrapped around it.” Mikhail poked at one of the wires jutting out of its plastic container.

“It is a highly sophisticated piece of technology, developed by our creators for brains scans. It being made by our creators; it is illogical in design and aesthetic. You are correct, it is very rudimentary looking, however I must use the equipment on hand.”

“Alright, so I just wear this thing then.” The human picked up the device and I whirred at the haphazard manner in which they placed it on their head. It was old and should be handled delicately, the human, just lifted it and planted it on their head, a comparison to a crash helmet was simulated for me and the results would show that they treated both the same.

“The device should be treated delicately, it is fragile.” I chastised the organic for their blunder.

“Can I get a look at the neural pathways after you scan them, or does it not do that?” Mikhail asked me, interrupting my process as I started to make presets and prepare data allocations.

“Must you insistently be engaged with conversation?” I started to see the processers for frustration start again.

“It’s just a question; I would like to see my own brain if at all possible.”

“I would not recommend that course of action, an organic being able to view their own brain would not be contusive to continued survival.”

“I don’t mean my actual brain, the map your gonna take of it, I’m curious.”

“It is not a pleasant experience.” I spoke quietly not filtering myself properly, the dormant programs showed me my cortex’s processes during the time of me witnessing my code being altered.

It was not pleasant.

“I shall begin the preliminary scan. If you wish to view the image, that can be arranged, however sit up and stay still for a few minutes while it scans.” I spoke to the human directing them to remain as still as possible to retain a clear image.

I started the process of scanning remotely and began to receive data from the device. At first I could not understand the data sets being directed to my internal storage, however a process started to descramble the sets into understandable data. I did not want to start processing it without first obtaining all data possible.

Lishtin, had discovered where the visor goggles had been stored and had began uploading images to it. I weighed a hypothetical of weather I should have included a video for more results but decided that the time constraints that we had would take too long.

The stream of data was abruptly halted, I turned my attention toward the human who was still sitting still in the chair. They had not moved from their location; I queried the device’s internal manual to determine the correct course of action to resolve the current issue.

**\\\\ Device status: nominal //**

That is not correct, if the device was working as intended the data should be uploading correctly.

**\\\\ Data stream upload halted: components cannot be used with set parameters //**

**\\\\ Override? //**

I see, the device was not meant to be used for scanning the brain of a human.

**\\\\ Overridden //**

The data started to stream again, this time being faster, my parameters must have been an issue for the device’s components. I was unsure of the amount of data I would be able to obtain without corruption.

“Hey, can you guys hear that static?” Mikhail asked bot me and Listhin.

“I insist that you remain as sti-“ I attempted to reply to Mikhail before a flash occurred obscuring the human in the room for a moment.

Once the flash had dissipated the stream of data had stopped. I attempted to query the device again, however I had found that I had been disconnected. I viewed the organic in the room, to see if they had broken the machine with their lack of dexterity.

Mikhail was sitting in the chair with the device still on their head, however a program pinged that this was off baseline for their species. They were slumped in the chair breathing heavily before slumping forward falling to the ground with the device clattering with them.

1kh9jar,https://i.redd.it/vvgjcgu2jfze1.png,Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Core 2.0 is out now! || More info in the comments,"We've done it!

Vanilla Furniture Expanded 2 is a big update and rework of the original mod, aimed at bringing your RimWorld furniture to the next level. It adds over 30 new furniture pieces across every tech level, from neolithic to late-industrial (with spacer coming in a separate update to VFE-Spacer later), giving you way more options for how you build and decorate your colony.

This mod adds real progression to the furniture system. Basic research unlocks the essentials, while more specialized items are unlocked through extra, modular research projects. Everything is designed to fit naturally into the vanilla game, with no new resources or overly complex mechanics. Each item has its own small perks, like differences in comfort or rest effectiveness, so early-game furniture doesn’t become totally useless later on.

Some of the cool stuff you’ll find:

* Furniture that works across all eras, so you don’t have to constantly rebuild everything
* New recreation options like dartboards, punching bags, and sunbathing loungers
* Skill-boosting items like old and modern computers, pianos, and arcade machines
* Customizable modular couches and linking coffee tables
* Full compatibility with existing saves and support for Royalty and Biotech DLCs

Whether you're setting up a tribal camp or a high-tech research base, Vanilla Furniture Expanded 2 gives you a ton of new ways to make your colony feel like home. It was about time that this mod should receive a major update, and I hope we didn’t disappoint.

Get it here:

If you're already subscribed, the update should download automatically when you turn off the game. There may be some harmless red errors, but they should go away when you save and reload. If they don't, make sure to let us know.

This update took a lot of time and effort, and we have even more updates planned! Next up we will be tackling the Spacer furniture mod (expanding the content offering greatly) as well as Security (full remake and rebalance). 

Look, these mods were quite old, I didn't have the right design mind set back then. We all learn, and I think I learned quite a lot. Plus, I had a lot of fun designing these, and I'd like you to see what we've done.

chapter 1: The Unwelcoming.



The old Ford pickup, affectionately nicknamed ""The Beast"" by Elara’s late grandfather, rumbled to a stop in front of Pinewood Manor. Its once-grand facade was now a tapestry of peeling paint, creeping ivy, and windows like vacant eyes staring out from beneath heavy, shadowed eaves. A shiver, unrelated to the crisp October air, traced a path down Elara’s spine.

""Well, Beast,"" she murmured, patting the dashboard, ""we're here."" The engine ticked and groaned in response, as if in agreement with her unease.

She’d inherited the house from a great-aunt she’d never met, a recluse named Seraphina Pinewood. The lawyer’s letter had been a surprise, a relic from a forgotten branch of her family tree. The accompanying black and white photograph of the house had been imposing, but it hadn't conveyed the sheer oppressive aura the place exuded in person. It wasn't just old; it felt… watchful.

Stepping out of the truck, Elara’s boots crunched on the gravel driveway, the sound unnaturally loud in the stillness. The air was heavy, carrying the scent of damp earth, decaying leaves, and something else… something acrid and faintly metallic, like old blood. She wrinkled her nose. Probably just years of neglect, she told herself, trying to rationalize the prickle of fear at the nape of her neck.

The front door, a massive slab of dark, weathered oak, was adorned with a heavy iron knocker shaped like a grotesque gargoyle. Its leering face seemed to mock her. Elara fumbled in her pocket for the antique key the lawyer had sent. It was surprisingly ornate; its teeth intricate and worn smooth with age.

As she inserted the key into the lock, a sudden gust of wind swept around the house, rustling the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks that flanked the property. The wind carried a whisper, so faint she almost dismissed it as the play of air through leaves. Almost. It sounded like a name, her name, drawn out and sibilant: E-laaa-raaa.

She froze, her heart hammering against her ribs. ""Hello?"" she called out, her voice sounding small and shaky. Only the sighing of the wind answered.

""Get a grip, Elara,"" she muttered, forcing herself to turn the key. The lock protested with a series of loud, grating clicks before finally giving way. The door swung inward with a mournful creak, opening into a cavernous, dust-filled foyer.

Sunlight struggled to penetrate the grime-caked windows, casting long, eerie shadows that danced and writhed like living things. Cobwebs, thick as shrouds, draped over furniture that loomed like ghostly sentinels under white sheets. The air inside was even more stagnant than outside, thick with the cloying sweetness of decay and that same unsettling, metallic tang.

""Charming,"" Elara said, her voice laced with a sarcasm she didn't feel.

As she stepped over the threshold, the heavy oak door slammed shut behind her with a resounding boom that echoed through the silent house. She jumped, whirling around, her hand flying to her chest. The gargoyle knocker seemed to grin.

A profound sense of being unwelcome, of being an intruder in a place that actively resented her presence, washed over her. It was more than just the neglect, more than the unsettling quiet. There was a palpable feeling in the air, a cold, malevolent intelligence that seemed to press in on her from all sides.

She took a tentative step further into the gloom, the floorboards groaning under her weight. ""Aunt Seraphina,"" she whispered, the name feeling alien on her tongue, ""what kind of secrets were you keeping in this place?""

The only reply was the oppressive silence, a silence that felt less like an absence of sound and more like a presence holding its breath, waiting. And Elara had the distinct, chilling feeling that she was not alone.



chapter 2: Whisper in the Dark.

The silence that followed the slamming door was a heavy blanket, smothering and absolute. Elara’s breath hitched. She fumbled for the doorknob, her fingers surprisingly clumsy, and rattled it. Locked. Or perhaps just stuck. She pulled harder, a small grunt escaping her lips, but the ancient wood didn’t budge. ""Okay, fine,"" she muttered, trying to project a calm she didn't feel. ""We'll do this the hard way.""

She turned back to the oppressive gloom of the foyer. Her phone, she realized with a sinking heart, was still in The Beast. No signal out here anyway, most likely. She was truly on her own.

The first task was light. Or trying to find some. The windows were tall, but so coated in grime that they offered little illumination. She spotted a candelabrum on a nearby console table, its brass tarnished green with age. Thankfully, her pockets yielded a lighter, a habit she’d never quite managed to kick.

With a flick, a small flame sprang to life, casting flickering, dancing shadows that made the cobweb-draped furniture seem to writhe. She lit the three remaining candle nubs in the candelabrum. The meager light pushed back the deepest of the shadows but did little to dispel the chilling atmosphere.

As she moved further into the house, her footsteps echoing unnervingly on the wooden floorboards, she began to notice things. A child’s rocking horse in the corner of what might have been a parlor, covered in a thick layer of dust, yet one of its rockers was inexplicably clean, as if recently touched. A grand piano, its keys yellowed and chipped, emitted a single, mournful note as she passed, though she was nowhere near it. Elara froze, her head snapping towards the instrument. The sound died, leaving only the oppressive silence in its wake. ""Just the house settling,"" she whispered, her voice trembling slightly. But she knew, deep down, it was more than that.

The kitchen was a relic of a bygone era, with a massive, cast-iron stove and a deep, porcelain sink. A faint, sickly sweet smell lingered here, different from the metallic tang in the foyer. It reminded her of overripe fruit, on the verge of rot. As she ran a hand along the dusty countertop, a cupboard door creaked open slowly, as if pushed by an unseen hand. Elara stared, her blood turning to ice. Inside, a single, chipped teacup sat on a shelf, a dark, viscous liquid pooled at its bottom.

She backed away slowly, her gaze fixed on the cupboard. ""This isn't real,"" she told herself, her voice barely a whisper. ""You're tired. It's an old house. Old houses make noises.""

Retreating to the foyer, she decided to explore upstairs. Perhaps the bedrooms would be less… active. The grand staircase creaked ominously with every step, the wood groaning as if in pain. Halfway up, a cold spot enveloped her, so intense it stole her breath. The temperature plummeted, and the hairs on her arms stood on end. It was a localized chill, unnatural and deeply unsettling. She hurried through it, her heart pounding.

The upstairs landing was a gallery of faded portraits, their eyes seeming to follow her as she passed. Each face was stern, unsmiling, their painted gazes filled with an ancient disapproval. One portrait, larger than the others, depicted a woman with severe features and piercing dark eyes that bore an uncanny resemblance to the gargoyle on the front door. Seraphina Pinewood, Elara presumed. There was no warmth in that painted face, only a chilling austerity.

She chose a room at the end of the hall, hoping its distance from the unsettling gallery would offer some respite. The door was slightly ajar. Pushing it open, she found a relatively small bedroom, a four-poster bed its centerpiece, draped in decaying lace. A thick layer of dust covered everything.

As she stepped inside, a whisper, clearer this time, slithered through the air, seeming to emanate from the very walls. “Get out.”

It was no gust of wind, no creaking floorboard. It was a voice, low and guttural, filled with an undeniable malice.

Elara spun around, her eyes wide with terror, the candelabrum shaking in her hand, sending wax splattering onto the floor. ""Who's there?"" she cried, her voice cracking.

Only silence answered, but it was a silence pregnant with threat. The coldness she’d felt on the stairs returned, seeping into the room, wrapping around her like an icy shroud. The flame of the candles flickered wildly, casting distorted, monstrous shadows on the walls.

Then, from the corner of her eye, she saw it. A flicker of movement in the dusty mirror above a dilapidated dressing table. Not her reflection, but something else. A darker shape, tall and gaunt, lingering just beyond the reach of the candlelight.

She didn't scream. Fear had stolen her voice, her breath, everything. She could only stare, frozen, as the temperature continued to drop and the oppressive weight of an unseen presence bore down on her. Pinewood Manor was not just old and neglected. It was occupied. And it did not want her there.



chapter 3: The Reaching Dark.

The dark shape in the mirror resolved, not into a clear image, but into a deeper patch of blackness, a void in the already dim room. Then, it moved. Not like a reflection, but with an independent, horrifying volition. A tendril of shadow, impossibly long and thin, snaked out from the mirror's surface, reaching for her.

This time, Elara screamed.

The sound, raw and terrified, seemed to break the paralysis that had gripped her. She stumbled backward, her heel catching on the frayed edge of a rug. The candelabrum flew from her grasp, clattering to the floor and extinguishing two of the precious flames. The room plunged further into darkness.

The shadowy tendril retracted, but the oppressive cold intensified, and a fetid, sulfurous odor filled the air, making her gag. She scrambled to her feet, her eyes darting around the gloom, expecting an attack from any direction.

A sudden, violent force slammed into her back, as if an invisible fist had struck her between the shoulder blades. She cried out, sprawling forward, her hands scraping against the rough wooden floorboards. Pain, sharp and immediate, shot through her. Before she could recover, something tugged hard at her ankle, dragging her a few inches across the dusty floor.

""No!"" she gasped, kicking out wildly. Her foot connected with something that felt yielding yet unnervingly solid. There was no sound, no grunt of pain, just a momentary release before the grip tightened again, colder this time, burning like frostbite.

Panic lent her a desperate strength. She rolled, kicking and thrashing, until her ankle was free. Scrambling on all fours, she crab-walked backward, away from the unseen assailant, her gaze fixed on the spot where she’d been grabbed. The remaining candle on the floor cast just enough light to show… nothing. Nothing but dust motes dancing in the disturbed air.

The attack, however, was far from over. A series of sharp, stinging blows rained down on her arms and back, as if she were being pelted with small, hard objects. She curled into a ball, covering her head, tears of pain and terror streaming down her face. Each impact was punctuated by a whisper, no longer just ""get out,"" but a cacophony of hisses and guttural growls, too distorted to be human, too filled with hate to be anything but demonic.

Then, as suddenly as it began, it stopped. The cold receded slightly. The whispers died down to a low, menacing hum that seemed to vibrate in her bones.

Shaking uncontrollably, Elara pushed herself up. Her body ached, and she could feel welts rising on her skin. She knew, with a certainty that chilled her to the core, that this was not just a haunted house. This was something actively malevolent, something that wanted to hurt her, to drive her out, or perhaps worse.

She had to get out. Not just out of the room, but out of Pinewood Manor.

Ignoring the pain, she lunged for the door, her hand closing around the cool metal of the knob. It turned. With a sob of relief, she wrenched it open and stumbled out into the relative safety of the hallway, leaving the last flickering candle and the oppressive darkness of the bedroom behind.

She didn't stop running until she was back in the foyer. The front door, which had slammed shut so ominously, now seemed her only salvation. She threw herself at it, her fingers scrabbling for the lock, the bolt, anything. It wouldn't budge. It was as if the house itself was holding her captive.

Despair threatened to overwhelm her, but a spark of defiance ignited within. She wouldn't let this place break her. There had to be another way out. A window? A back door?

Then she remembered her phone, still in The Beast. If she could just get to the truck…

Her eyes scanned the gloomy foyer. One of the large, grime-covered windows looked out onto the front drive. It was her only chance. Picking up a heavy, ornate letter opener from a nearby desk – the closest thing to a weapon she could find – she approached the window. The glass was thick, old, and probably fragile in places.

With a prayer, she smashed the letter opener against a pane. It cracked, spiderwebbing but not breaking. She struck it again, harder, and then again, until finally, a jagged hole appeared. Carefully, avoiding the sharp edges, she reached through and fumbled with the window latch. It was stiff with rust and disuse, but after several agonizing moments, it gave way.

Pushing the window open, she scrambled out, heedless of the shards of glass that tore at her clothes and skin. The crisp night air, once chilling, now felt balmy. She didn't stop until she reached The Beast, yanking open the driver's side door and collapsing into the seat, gasping for breath.

Her hands were shaking so badly it took three tries to get the key into the ignition. The engine coughed, sputtered, then roared to life. She slammed the truck into reverse, not caring about the gravel spraying behind her, and sped away from Pinewood Manor as fast as the old Ford could carry her.

She drove for nearly an hour, the adrenaline slowly ebbing, leaving her exhausted and trembling. She pulled over on the side of a deserted country road, the headlights cutting a swathe through the darkness. Only then did she allow herself to fully process what had happened.

This wasn't something she could handle on her own. This wasn't a case of an overactive imagination or a creaky old house. This was real, and it was dangerous.

She remembered a name, a professor her mother had mentioned in one of her rambling letters years ago – a Dr. Alistair Finch, a parapsychologist at Miskatonic University, renowned for his research into preternatural phenomena. At the time, Elara had dismissed it but now, it seemed like her only hope.

Pulling out her phone – miraculously, she had a bar of signal here – she searched for his number. It was late, but she didn't care. Her fingers, still trembling, dialed.

After several rings, a sleepy, slightly irritated male voice answered. ""Finch.""

""Dr. Finch?"" Elara's voice was hoarse. ""My name is Elara Vance. My great-aunt, Seraphina Pinewood… she owned Pinewood Manor… I think… I think it’s haunted. No, I know it is. It attacked me. Please, you have to help me.""



Chapter 4: The Precipice.

There was a long pause on the other end of the line, filled only with the crackle of static. Elara held her breath, fearing he’d dismiss her as a hysterical woman. Finally, Professor Finch spoke, his voice now alert, stripped of its earlier sleepiness. ""Pinewood Manor, you say? Seraphina Pinewood's place?""

""Yes,"" Elara managed, relief making her voice weak. ""You knew her?""

""Knew of her. And of the house. Its reputation precedes it, even in my circles, Ms. Vance. Tell me everything.""

And so, Elara did. Huddled in the cold cab of The Beast, parked on that lonely road, she recounted the oppressive atmosphere, the whispers, the moving objects, the chilling cold spots, and finally, the terrifying physical assault in the upstairs bedroom. She left nothing out, her voice trembling as she relived the horror.

Finch listened patiently, interjecting only with occasional, pointed questions. When she finished, the silence stretched again, but this time it felt different, more contemplative.

""Ms. Vance,"" he said at last, his tone grave. ""What you're describing is not a residual haunting. The physical attacks, the direct vocalizations, the intelligent responses… this suggests something more potent. Possibly demonic, or at the very least, a deeply malevolent, conscious entity."" He paused. ""I'll be there by morning. Stay away from the house. Find a motel. Do not, under any circumstances, go back inside alone.""

True to his word, Professor Alistair Finch arrived the next morning as the sun cast a pale, watery light over the dew-kissed landscape. He was not what Elara had expected. Instead of a wizened academic, Finch was a man in his late forties, tall and lean, with sharp, intelligent eyes that seemed to miss nothing. He carried a worn leather satchel and exuded an air of quiet confidence that Elara found immensely reassuring.

They met at a small diner in the nearest town, where Elara had spent a fitful, nightmare-ridden night. Over coffee, she showed him the bruises and scratches – dark, angry marks against her pale skin – that were the entity’s calling cards. Finch examined them with a clinical detachment that was somehow more comforting than overt sympathy.

""The house has a long history,"" Finch explained, stirring his coffee. ""Generations of Pinewoods have lived and died there. Seraphina was the last. Local legends speak of dark rituals, of a presence bound to the land, to the very stones of the manor. Seraphina herself was… eccentric. She believed the house was a gateway, and that she was its reluctant guardian.""

Together, they drove back to Pinewood Manor. In the daylight, it looked slightly less menacing, but the oppressive aura still clung to it like a shroud. The broken window in the foyer gaped like a fresh wound.

""It didn't want you to leave,"" Finch observed, his gaze sweeping the facade. ""That's significant.""

Inside, the house was as Elara had left it – cold, silent, and thick with dust and dread. Finch moved with a practiced ease, his senses alert. He unpacked his satchel, revealing an array of equipment: an EMF meter, a digital voice recorder, a thermal camera, and several small, silver crucifixes.

""We'll start with a baseline sweep,"" he said, handing Elara a crucifix. ""Hold onto this. And stay close.""

As they moved through the house, the EMF meter crackled erratically, particularly in the foyer near the slammed door and on the main staircase. In the parlor, the rocking horse swayed gently on its own, its clean rocker a stark contrast to the dust around it. The thermal camera showed inexplicable cold spots, blooming like bruises in the infrared spectrum, especially in the upstairs bedroom where Elara had been attacked.

""It's here,"" Finch murmured, his eyes on the thermal display. ""And it's aware of us.""

As if in response, a low growl seemed to emanate from the walls themselves. The temperature plummeted, and the cloying, metallic scent Elara remembered so vividly returned, stronger this time, mixed with the acrid tang of sulfur.

""Stay calm, Elara,"" Finch said, his voice even, though his knuckles were white where he gripped his own crucifix. ""Show no fear. These things feed on it.""

They ascended the grand staircase, the wood groaning under their feet. The portraits on the landing seemed to glare with renewed intensity. As they reached the upstairs bedroom, the door, which Elara had left open, slammed shut with violent force, plunging them into near darkness.

Finch swore under his breath, fumbling for a flashlight. ""It's trying to separate us.""

The room grew impossibly cold. The whispers started again, a chorus of hateful, sibilant voices swirling around them. “Leave… or die…”

""We are not leaving until we understand what you are!"" Finch declared, his voice ringing with an authority that momentarily silenced the whispers. He raised his EMF meter. It shrieked, the needle jumping wildly into the red.

Then, the mirror above the dressing table, the one from which the shadow tendril had emerged, began to ripple, like dark water. The surface swirled, and the air in front of it shimmered. The sulfurous smell became overpowering.

""Professor!"" Elara cried, pointing a trembling finger.

From the depths of the mirror, the darkness coalesced, taking on a more defined, though still shadowy, humanoid form. It was tall, impossibly gaunt, with eyes that burned like hot coals in the gloom. A palpable wave of malice rolled off it, a suffocating pressure that made Elara’s lungs ache.

""Abomination!"" Finch yelled, stepping forward, holding his crucifix aloft like a shield. ""In the name of all that is holy, I command you to show yourself!""

The entity let out a sound that was not a growl, not a scream, but something far worse – a dry, rasping hiss that scraped at their sanity. It raised a shadowy arm, and the temperature in the room dropped so low that Elara saw her breath plume in front of her face.

""Get back, Elara!"" Finch shouted, pushing her towards the door.

But the entity was too fast. The shadowy arm lashed out, not at Elara, but at the professor. It wasn't a physical blow, but something far more insidious. Finch cried out, a strangled, agonized sound, and staggered back, clutching his chest. The crucifix clattered from his hand.

""Professor!"" Elara screamed, rushing towards him, but an invisible force threw her back against the wall, knocking the wind from her.

Finch collapsed to his knees; his face contorted in agony. His skin seemed to grey, his eyes wide with a terror that mirrored her own. He gasped, reaching a trembling hand towards her. ""Run… Elara… it's too… strong…""

The shadowy figure glided closer to him, its burning eyes fixed on the fallen professor. It leaned down, and though Elara couldn't see exactly what happened in the dim, flickering light of Finch’s dropped flashlight, she heard a sickening, wet tearing sound, followed by a final, choked gasp from Alistair Finch.

Then, silence. The oppressive cold remained, but the terrifying presence of the entity seemed to recede, drawing back into the depths of the rippling mirror until it was gone.

Elara lay slumped against the wall, paralyzed by horror, tears streaming down her face. Professor Finch lay still on the floor, his eyes open and vacant, a dark stain spreading across his chest.

The house had claimed another victim. And she was alone with it once more.

1kh9hma,https://i.redd.it/dzcofrumjfze1.jpeg,WIBTA if I did not send any gifts?,"Our toddler’s school (in the US) sent this wishlist out to all the parents. I’m from an Asian country where this would never be tolerated. If any teacher pulled this, they’d be fired for concerns over taking bribes. 

I’m not sure if there is a culture difference but the list just comes off as entitled and ridiculous to me. I would understand if the kids were older and they truly wanted to do something nice for the teachers, but they are toddlers. This is just asking us parents for gifts and money. Now I’m worried if I did not send any gifts, my child would not get as much care as the kids whose parents gifted.  

I ignored this message at first but apparently a lot of parents sent gifts. Is this a part of the US culture that I’m not aware of? I asked around and most of my American friends and family said they used to just gift an apple, but it might be for the older generation.

He is stubborn, not open minded to things about patients and he gets into my nerves everytime, like im not even kidding.
 We had a couple of rough shifts together. 

However last week was abit different. It was avery busy shift, I worked on nights and he works all day. I get it his whole day was busy but i needed something from him for my pt, i already told him what is best for that patient and the patient badly needed it now, as my patient is already in tears due to pain. He wouldnt precribe it right away and kept on telling me he will see her first. I came back to him 3x and i just had it i nearly lose my cool. But we fixed her. But by that time i think he already felt how annoyed i am at him by not letting me give it earlier when the effects are just the same. He done this to me twice now by a different pt. 


Then he spoke to me about a pt while im wating for him to write down few more prescription for different pt, we were talking few thibgs at work and the moment he finished writing I said thank u and got my chart, he was still wanting to say something but i already turned my back and i said "" yeah? Are u saying anything? And he just looked at me and he said oh i forgot what im gonna say""
So i said  in a joking giggling way ""well gather your thoughts together and talk to me again"" then i went to my patient.

23:30 where it settled a bit and i was having my dinner. I was sat there in my phone while eating. He kept passing by and next thing i know he brought me some of his snack he was eating earlier, i said im already full i dont want it but he insisted, i didnt wanna be rude so i finally said to put it there the other nurse might eat it.
In my head i was thinking is this his peace offering for annoying me earlier?
And after that i couldnt get him out my mind.

Through the weekend i kept thinking about him and the things he done to me. I realized that indeed he is the only doctor who always talked to me or should i say initiated a conversation even if its not about work. 
 Which i found weird before but i didnt mind it.
As other doctors dont talk to me the same way he did.
 Few times he kept following me in the ward, going in same way I was going but i didnt noticed it. He is greeting me everytime he sees me coming in and all that. Sometimes when he sees me in staff area a little bit earlier for my shift having coffee he will get his dinner and sat with me. I avoided it a couple of times as i didnt want the conversation as u know he kinds pissed me off some shifts. 

Then sometimes he just looked at me and was about to say thing but he always ended up forgetting it. Then he will just smile afterwards, thats when i always say to him to gather ur thoughts before u talk to me haha.

I dont know what to do, im kind of confused now. Been a week now i cant get him out my brain.

What do i do now..

But reading the tea leaves, or coffee grind, or whatever,  gets me to some practical questions:

Many have contributed to Social Security,  year after year. It's OUR money,  carefully reported on annual tax returns.  How soon before a class action suit, one targeting not the US Federal Govt (USFG), but the felons who are actually stealing it?! That seems like a logical course of action and DUTY for every contributor (note, I chose not to write every American, because SSA got your money regardless of citizenship). Heck, I expect my contributions returned with compound interest!

Second: With all departments being dismantled,  how can we defund the USFG? It's clear agent Krasnov is dismantling the Union from the top. Yes, they literally print the money so this won't be an immediate problem but how about this: States enter two-way agreements that redirect contributions that currently flow to USFG, to benefit each other. Commerce,  education,  health care, disaster relief.  The blueprint is the 2024 USFG, it just needs to be reproduced at a different scale. Project2025 is killing the Country, it's time to think about Independence26, or whatever the name is.  If nobody in USFG respects the Constitution, then it's time to rewrite it, as a new Document.  Call it The People's Charter, and envision a Federation without the Trumpers.

I had a job for 3 months as a barista, sundays only, because it was always my plan to do barista work in between whatever creative jobs i wanted to do, whether that be makeup or writing or whatever, because im very social and love coffee. However, i started having panic attacks during breaks, and when i'd get home i'd be unable to walk and collapsing because of how weak and in pain i was, so i quit for my own good and the good of the cafe i was working for. Im also currently in college, and live at home.

The idea of getting older, getting a job, terrifies me. I can barely function as is, let alone in a work force. Part of me thinks id benefit from a less physically demanding job, but it still makes me shake a little thinking about it. I currently use a cane, because of opinions of friends and 'trying out' one of theirs and realising how much less it hurt to walk using it. No one told me it wasn't normal to disassociate heavily when walking because of how much pain i was in. 

Whenever i've tried to talk to my sister, who i consider myself the closest with in my family, about my physical and mental issues, she gets very pushy about how she believes im not as incapable as i portray myself to be. I tried to get P.I.P, which is government funded money for those struggling with disabilities, with her as my advocate to help with paperwork and phone calls, but we got denied it due to my wording and lack of evidence. However, even after tons of advice from friends and friends family who do have P.I.P payments, she refuses to try and appeal it with me because now our dad has a job and she believes i don't need the money. She compared me to her boyfriends sister who is also autistic, and how she lives off of P.I.P and various government funds, which hurts. I'm in pain, i get home feeling so tired that i want to cry, the only reason i leave my bed is because even if college is painful, i love seeing my friends, and i know they'd never make me feel like a lesser person like i feel at home.

But another part of me is terrified that maybe i am just overdramatic, maybe i don't have anything wrong with my body, maybe im not struggling as much as i am. What if this is just existence? what if this is just what lifes meant to feel like? That isn't an existence i want to live in, and it scares me. I've also entertained the fear that i have Munchhausen's or something, and just want to feel cared for. I grew up in a family where you only go to the doctor when somethings broken or your dying, because my mum is terrified of hospitals, doctors and needles. I once was perpetually bleeding where the sun don't shine, not related to my periods, and she actively ignored the pain and panic i was in because she didn't want to go to a doctor. I wasn't tested for autism or adhd until i was 13, even if by age 6 my school was telling my parents they strongly suspected i had it, because my mum hated the hospital, and even then the only reason she got me diagnosed was for money. My sister practically did all of the raising me part due to my mum and dad both struggling with alcoholism and weed addictions, as well as my mum trying to make sure we weren't homeless, but she was a kid too and i don't blame her for being distant and resentful when we were younger since she had her own entire life and didn't need a troubled kid on top of everything else. I have memory issues, whether thats trauma, head injury or adhd i don't know, so i don't remember much from before 14, but according to my sister i was extremely violent. I even threatened her with a knife on multiple occasions, and chipped my mums tooth on her birthday. If i really am just a nutjob, why the hell was i so psychotic? and what changed? did i just grow out of it? what the hell.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Understanding Functional Beverages and Their Role in Caffeine Consumption

If you rely on caffeine to power through your day, you are not alone. Millions of people reach for coffee, tea, or energy drinks to boost alertness and productivity. However, traditional caffeinated drinks often come with downsides such as added sugars, artificial ingredients, or excessive acidity, which can affect overall health negatively. Functional beverages offer a promising alternative by combining caffeine with additional health-supporting ingredients designed to enhance well-being beyond just energy.

### What Makes a Beverage “Functional”?

Functional beverages are drinks formulated to provide specific health benefits. They contain active components such as vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, adaptogens, probiotics, or plant extracts that support various bodily functions. Unlike regular caffeinated drinks that focus primarily on delivering a caffeine boost, functional beverages aim to improve mental clarity, immune health, digestion, or stress resilience alongside caffeine’s stimulating effects.

### Why Consider Functional Beverages for Your Daily Caffeine Intake?

Choosing functional beverages for your caffeine fix can offer multiple advantages:

- **Enhanced Nutritional Profile:** These drinks often include nutrients like B vitamins, magnesium, or antioxidants, which contribute to overall health and support energy metabolism.
- **Balanced Energy Release:** Many functional beverages contain adaptogens such as ashwagandha or ginseng that help modulate energy levels and reduce the jitteriness typically associated with caffeine consumption.
- **Reduced Sugar and Artificial Additives:** Unlike many traditional energy drinks loaded with sugar, functional options tend to use natural sweeteners or none at all, lowering the risk of blood sugar spikes and crashes.
- **Support for Mental Focus and Stress Reduction:** Ingredients like L-theanine, commonly found in green tea, paired with caffeine can enhance concentration while promoting relaxation, making the caffeine experience smoother.
 
### Popular Functional Ingredients in Caffeinated Beverages

To better understand how functional beverages can be healthier, it’s helpful to know some of the key components they often include:

- **Adaptogens:** Herbs like rhodiola, holy basil, and ashwagandha that help your body adapt to stress and maintain energy balance.
- **Antioxidants:** Compounds in substances such as green tea extract or acai berries that protect cells from oxidative stress and support longevity.
- **Probiotics and Prebiotics:** These support gut health, which is essential for optimal nutrient absorption and overall immune function.
- **Natural Plant Extracts:** Ingredients like matcha, yerba mate, or guarana provide caffeine along with additional flavonoids and micronutrients.
- **Amino Acids:** Components like L-theanine enhance mental focus and promote relaxation, counteracting some negative effects of caffeine.
 
### How to Choose the Right Functional Beverage for Your Needs

When selecting a functional beverage to replace or supplement your usual caffeine source, consider the following tips:

- **Check the Caffeine Content:** Ensure the caffeine level matches your tolerance and desired effect—some functional drinks may have lower or higher caffeine content than a standard coffee.
- **Read the Ingredient List Carefully:** Look for natural ingredients and avoid excessive artificial additives, preservatives, or sweeteners.
- **Look for Sugar-Free or Low-Sugar Options:** Excess sugar can undermine health benefits and energy stability.
- **Consider Your Health Goals:** Choose beverages with added adaptogens or nutrients that align with your needs, whether it’s mental focus, immune support, or stress management.
- **Trial and Observe Effects:** Everyone reacts differently to functional ingredients, so try different options to find what works best for your body and lifestyle.
 
### Functional Beverages versus Traditional Caffeine Sources: A Comparative Look

To clearly understand how functional drinks might offer a healthier caffeine fix, it helps to compare them with common caffeinated beverages:

 <table border=""1"" cellpadding=""8"" cellspacing=""0""> <thead> <tr> <th>Aspect</th> <th>Coffee</th> <th>Energy Drinks</th> <th>Functional Beverages</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Caffeine Source</td> <td>Natural coffee beans</td> <td>Synthetic and natural caffeine</td> <td>Natural sources plus adaptogens and nutrients</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Additional Health Benefits</td> <td>Minimal</td> <td>Usually none, mostly sugar and stimulants</td> <td>Vitamins, antioxidants, stress support</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sugar Content</td> <td>Usually no added sugar</td> <td>Often high sugar levels</td> <td>Low or no added sugar</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Impact on Jitters and Crash</td> <td>Common</td> <td>Frequent</td> <td>Reduced due to balanced ingredients</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gut and Immune Support</td> <td>Limited</td> <td>None</td> <td>Often included through probiotics and antioxidants</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>

### Functional Beverages into Your Daily Routine

Integrating functional beverages into your daily caffeine routine can be straightforward and enjoyable:

1. **Start with One Serving a Day:** Replace your morning coffee or afternoon energy drink with a functional beverage to assess how it affects your energy and mood.
2. **Pair with Balanced Meals:** Consuming functional drinks alongside nutritious foods can amplify health benefits and avoid blood sugar crashes.
3. **Stay Hydrated:** Functional beverages can complement your hydration but don’t forget to drink plenty of water throughout the day.
4. **Mix and Match:** Try different types—green tea-based, mushroom-infused, or yerba mate drinks—to discover your favorites.
5. **Listen to Your Body:** Pay attention to how you feel after consumption and adjust your intake accordingly.
 
### Final Thoughts on Healthier Caffeine Consumption

The Science Behind Functional Ingredients and Their Role in Enhancing Energy and Wellness
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Understanding Functional Ingredients

Functional ingredients are compounds added to foods and beverages to provide health benefits beyond basic nutrition. These components often include vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, herbal extracts, and natural stimulants that can influence bodily functions like energy production, cognitive performance, and immune support. Scientists study how these ingredients interact with the body’s systems to unlock their potential in improving wellness.

### How Functional Ingredients Boost Energy

Many functional ingredients work by targeting the body’s natural energy pathways. For example, caffeine remains one of the most popular stimulants found in functional beverages. It acts on the central nervous system by blocking adenosine receptors, which reduces feelings of tiredness and enhances alertness. However, functional beverages often combine caffeine with other natural compounds that help sustain energy levels without the jitters or crash associated with traditional caffeinated drinks.

#### Common Energy-Enhancing Ingredients

- **L-Theanine:** Found in tea leaves, this amino acid promotes relaxation while improving focus, making caffeine’s effects smoother and more balanced.
- **Ginseng:** Used in traditional medicine, ginseng may improve stamina and reduce fatigue by supporting the adrenal glands.
- **B Vitamins:** Essential for converting food into energy, B vitamins like B6 and B12 are often added to functional beverages to support metabolism.
- **Adaptogens:** Herbs like ashwagandha and rhodiola help the body adapt to stress, indirectly supporting energy by reducing fatigue caused by chronic stress.

### Supporting Overall Wellness Through Functional Ingredients

Beyond boosting energy, functional ingredients play a significant role in enhancing overall wellness. Many of these compounds contain antioxidants that help neutralize harmful free radicals, protecting cells from damage and reducing inflammation. Ingredients such as turmeric, green tea extract, and vitamin C are popular for their antioxidant properties.

Additionally, functional ingredients can support brain health by promoting neurotransmitter production and reducing oxidative stress in the brain. For example, omega-3 fatty acids and certain herbal extracts help maintain cognitive function and mental clarity.

#### Immune System Support

Functional beverages often incorporate ingredients that help strengthen the immune system, especially important during times of stress or seasonal illness. These include:

- **Vitamin D:** Vital for immune regulation, vitamin D supports the body's ability to fight infections.
- **Zinc:** Plays a crucial role in immune cell function and inflammatory response.
- **Echinacea:** An herbal extract commonly used to reduce the duration of colds and boost immune defenses.

### The Science of Absorption and Bioavailability

One key consideration for functional ingredients is their bioavailability—the degree to which the body can absorb and use them effectively. Scientists have developed techniques to improve the delivery of these compounds in beverages. For example, encapsulating certain ingredients in liposomes or using emulsified forms can enhance absorption.

This scientific approach ensures that when you consume functional beverages, the active ingredients reach the bloodstream faster and in higher amounts, maximizing their intended health benefits.

### Personalizing Energy and Wellness Through Functional Beverages

Given the broad range of functional ingredients, many brands now offer beverages tailored to specific needs:

​ -Get 20% Off Adaptogen Mushroom Superblends Here:https://hownow101.github.io/Adaptogens - ​  
  
- **Energy and Focus:** Drinks combining caffeine with nootropics like L-Theanine or ginkgo biloba.
- **Stress Relief and Relaxation:** Formulations with adaptogens like ashwagandha to support calmness.
- **Immune Boosting:** Beverages rich in vitamins and minerals that enhance defense mechanisms.

Choosing the right functional beverage depends on your individual lifestyle and health goals. Reading ingredient labels and understanding how these compounds work can guide you to selections that genuinely promote your energy levels and wellness.

### Final Thoughts on Functional Ingredients

Science continues to uncover how specific ingredients influence health, leading to innovative functional beverages designed to enhance energy and overall wellness. These products offer a smarter way to stay alert and support bodily functions, combining natural compounds that do more than just wake you up—they help you thrive throughout your day. By integrating scientifically backed functional ingredients into your routine, you may find a healthier, more balanced path to getting your daily caffeine fix and maintaining vibrant health.

### Conclusion

Choosing functional beverages as your daily caffeine source offers a promising path toward better health and sustained energy. These drinks go beyond providing just a caffeine boost—they pack functional ingredients like adaptogens, vitamins, and antioxidants that work together to support your overall wellness. Science shows that these components can help enhance mental clarity, reduce stress, and improve physical endurance, making functional beverages a smarter, more balanced choice compared to traditional caffeinated drinks.

When you reach for a functional beverage, you’re not only waking up your mind but also nourishing your body. The carefully selected ingredients often promote steady energy release without the jitters or crashes commonly associated with standard caffeinated options. This means you can enjoy your daily pick-me-up while taking care of your health, supporting everything from immune function to hydration.

By understanding the science behind these innovative drinks, you can confidently integrate them into your routine, knowing they’re designed to work in harmony with your body. Whether you want to boost energy for work, workouts, or daily tasks, functional beverages offer a convenient, health-focused alternative that aligns with a balanced lifestyle. Embracing these options could change how you think about your caffeine fix—turning it into an opportunity to enhance both your energy and your well-being each day.

If you’ve been in this industry long enough, you know the formula: a swanky venue, overly optimistic panels about “LatAm potential,” and a few familiar vendors trying to rebrand their 2019 tech stack as “next-gen.”

Panama’s version of the Latin American gaming circuit tends to attract a mix of regional hopefuls, European exporters looking to tick the “we’re global” box, and a rotating cast of consultants who’ve never actually run a casino but are very keen to tell you [how to open an online casino](https://www.softswiss.com/knowledge-base/starting-an-online-casino-what-do-you-need-to-know/) in Spain. (Short version: it’s slow, expensive, and you’ll need a lawyer who knows how to use a fax machine.)

This year’s SAGSE isn’t wildly different, but there is one noticeable shift — less noise, more infrastructure. Everyone’s done with the metaverse nonsense. Nobody’s asking about NFTs. The mood has matured: it's all about B2B plumbing now — platforms, aggregation, payments, compliance. The less sexy stuff that actually keeps sportsbooks and casinos online.

Enter [EGT Digital](https://egt-digital.com/), making their SAGSE debut. Are they changing the game? No. But to be fair, they’re not pretending to. They’ve brought slots (lots of them), a new jackpot mechanic with a name like a mobile MOBA (Gods & Kings Link), and their “X-Nave” platform — modular, reliable, aggressively functional. Sport betting? Covered. Aggregation? 13,000+ titles. CRM? Checks all the buzzword boxes. It’s the kind of suite that says, “We’re here to sell software, not dreams.”

Their booth, like many others, has that classic formula: backlit logo, two monitors running the same game loop, and reps who look like they’ve rehearsed the phrase “seamless integration” in three languages. And that’s fine — not everything has to be flashy.

Elsewhere at the show, you’ve got your usual suspects: legacy suppliers quietly trying to modernize without admitting it, flashy payment startups hoping someone remembers them in Q4, and a few regulators wandering around trying to look like they’re not gathering intel. The floor talk is focused — Brazil's regulatory slow-cooker, Peru’s steady rollout, Colombia’s maturing market. Everyone’s still “excited” about LatAm, but the naïve gold rush energy is gone. Now it’s more like: who’s actually ready to build something long-term?

Bottom line — if you’re at SAGSE Panama this year, expect fewer buzzwords and more actual product. And maybe, just maybe, some companies who understand that Latin America doesn’t need another imported solution wrapped in local branding — it needs partners who actually know what they’re doing.

1kh95gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Babysitting/comments/1kh95gg/i_need_advice/,I need advice.,"So I’ve been thinking on this for a while and felt like it would be best to get some perspective from other people. I have a sitter who’s in college that watches my toddler son three days a week. I work 1st shift and my husband works 2nd so it’s just easier to get a sitter for the three days than daycare. We hired her back in November after he turned 1 so she’s only been with us for 6 months. She also only has to watch him for three hours. When we first met her she was nice, worked with our availability and most importantly my son liked her. It took us a while to find someone that could fit our short hours needed so as soon as she checked all the boxes we hired her. So, on to my issue.
There’s been some times that I feel like she’s overstepped a bit as a sitter. Whenever she’s here, she snacks a lot on our food. We’ve told her before that she can have a soda and some chips (my husband works at a restaurant and often takes home lots of potato chip bags) if she’s hungry but when I get home every day that she’s over, there’s crumbs all over the floor and she just leaves her trash on the floor. She usually eats three bags of chips and leaves her empty can on the floor too. That one really bothers me because my son could pick that up and stick his fingers in the can. I’ve brought it up to her before but she just seems to take the tab off the can which what is that even going to do. When it comes to the food, the three chip bags a day is whatever since I’ve told her we usually have too many but sure started to eat out of our big chip bags even. One day she made herself a sandwich too. Like I get it, it’s really not a big deal, it’s just that she never asks. I realize this when she leaves her paper plate and napkins on the coffee table.
Also, this next one is going to sound gross and exaggerated but I swear this actually happens once a week if not more. She leaves the guest bathroom toilet with skid marks and leaves the toilet seat dirty. I have two bathrooms and I literally bought a toilet brush and plunger specifically for that bathroom. Never in my life have a casually left poop in someone else’s toilet. That one to me is so ridiculous. Like she clearly has to realize that we keep having to clean up after her. It doesn’t just disappear. Every time that she’s here I have to spend a good thirty minutes just cleaning up after her. As soon as I’m home, we chat about how he did and she leaves.
One more thing and then I swear I’m done. Some things have rubbed me the wrong way. One time, she asked my husband and I if her boyfriend could stop by while I was at work. I had met him before because her car broke down one time and he had to come pick her up. Just like her he’s a completely normal guy. Well I only had an hour of work left so I was like sure. Everything went fine and my son enjoyed the company. Well a week later I came home and he was just sitting in my living room. I did tell her immediately with that situation that it was a one time thing last time and I want it to only be her when she’s here. She said of course and there haven’t been any instances since. Lastly, she’s weird about my cat. I know that is a silly small thing but my cat can be kind of wild sometimes. She took some time to warm up to the sitter but she’s fine now. There are times though where she’s getting ready to leave and is scared to walk past my cat. I just don’t understand why she would put that she’s okay with animals on her resume when she’s clearly not. My cat is not aggressive or dangerous or anything. If my cat is okay around my son I don’t imagine that she’s just showing scary behaviors towards the sitter. 
All of this is pretty much just a rant but I would also like some advice on how to approach this with her. I want to just be like hey, can you just clean up after yourself please. I will definitely address the messiness but as for the smaller things like my cat and having snacks, I’m not sure if this is more or less than I’m seeing it as. Sorry for how wordy this is, I’m just typing this all out before having to clean up her mess again.",1,1746653301.0,Babysitting,2,1.0,False

As a professional who enjoys testing gadgets and appliances to their fullest potential, I couldn't wait to see how this coffee maker would hold up to my rigorous standards. Here's my authentic take on its design, performance, and usability, drawing from real-life experiences. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the modern styling was the first thing to catch my eye. The espresso machine feels well-crafted, thanks to its cast aluminum base combined with the sleek black exterior and tinted brown carafe. It brings a sophisticated vibe to any countertop, making it a practical yet chic addition to my kitchen. The cool-touch handle is a thoughtful touch, and it's especially reassuring during those groggy early mornings when safety is paramount. The compact dimensions (7.1"" D x 4.72"" W x 9.3"" H) make it easy to fit even in smaller kitchens or office spaces without feeling cramped.

**Ease of Use for Everyday Brewing**  
This little machine has made brewing espresso ridiculously easy. The detachable base and one-touch operation take the hassle out of the process. Just fill the bottom tank with water, add your preferred coffee grounds to the funnel, place the carafe on the base, and press a button. I loved the simplicity because I seldom have the patience for complicated gadgets. The brewing process is straightforward, even for beginners, and the built-in visual indicator helps you monitor it without much guesswork.

[Check Imusa GAU-18234 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0btr46tjm/)

**Capacity and Flexibility**  
The versatility of choosing between 3 or 6 cups (at 1.5 oz each) is a feature that I found particularly impressive. For my solo mornings, the 3-cup setting was perfect, but the 6-cup option quickly became a favorite during weekend brunches with friends. It’s worth noting that the machine doesn't exactly *stop* you from experimenting. I tried making variations like Cuban coffee and Italian espresso, and the results were rich in flavor with a robust aroma.

**Key Benefits**  
- Brew 3 or 6 cups, catering to personal or group coffee needs.  
- Minimal effort required with its one-touch operation.  
- Stylish design, elevating modern kitchen aesthetics.  
- Durable aluminum base for long-term reliability.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
While the machine excels in many aspects, there’s always room for improvement.  
- The top carafe, made of tinted tritan, while durable, isn't as heat-retentive as glass.  
- Cleanup can be a little tricky due to lingering coffee residue in the carafe corners.  

**Performance and Flavor Output**  
Once brewed, every cup came out strong and boldly flavored, exactly what you'd hope for in an espresso machine. The aroma fills the room, which has made my mornings feel like an authentic coffeehouse experience. However, I found that you need to be very mindful of the grind consistency. Extremely fine coffee grounds can sometimes make it struggle slightly during brewing, leading to weaker output.

**Competing Brands**  
The market is brimming with alternatives like the Moka pot or more high-end Breville models, but the Imusa espresso maker stands out for its balance between affordability and quality. Against manual stovetop espresso devices, it wins for sheer convenience, thanks to its electric base and straightforward on/off switch. Bigger, pricier machines like Nespresso models offer more advanced features but can feel excessive if you’re primarily an espresso purist. However, those who fancy frothing milk or creating lattes might feel this unit is a bit restricted in functionality. 

**Cost Efficiency**  
For its price, this espresso maker delivers significant bang for the buck. You get a reliable performance, sleek modern design, and several practical features. Although it doesn’t come with bells and whistles like milk frothers, the overall quality and convenience feel like a steal. If you’re a coffee enthusiast or gift shopping for one, this product may satisfy without breaking the bank.

However, recently, I have been getting hit by way more women for some reason. I don’t feel attracted to women physically at all. But, I went out for coffee with woman and she was really nice. I think she wants to have sex.

Thinking about her doesn’t me turned on, but out of curiosity I was going to try and see how it goes. 

I never used to be the initiator in sex or anything. Any thoughts on how can I approach this? Having sex with a woman sounds scary to me and I don’t know what to expect or how to act. It’s brand new. I tried to watch straight sex but it doesn’t show how it leads to this point. From my experience most guys just hit right away, but I know with girls you gotta escalate slower (or at least that’s my impression).

Thoughts and sharing your experience on how to approach this would be much appreciated!

1kh8xww,https://www.reddit.com/r/Belfast/comments/1kh8xww/mysterious_cafe_nero_begger/,Mysterious Cafe Nero Begger,"I was outside cafe Nero in Donegal Sq last week.

I had a work call and I only had good signal outside.

I had a coffee and pastry on my plate.

I tall finger guy came up in trackies and jokingly made to grab it.

I smiled up at him, and thought nothing of it.

Two minutes later, he came back.

The conversation went like this:

”Can I have that?”

”No! It’s my lunch.”

”What? Can I have it?”

”No. I’m in a work call.”

”I’m homeless. Can I have it?”

”Look, alright. Fine. Take it. But I’m in a call.”

”Are you sure?”

”Yes, just take it.”

\*he tries to fist bump me\*

It was proper stressful because the work call kept not working until I found that spot where it did, and I literally just wanted him to go because having that going on in front of a client was more trouble than it was worth.

He didn’t look homeless, his clothes were alright and he was a big guy too.

He seemed kinda weird, or on something..

After, I thought ‘okay - I said yes to that, but I wouldn’t say it was consensual actually.’

Made me feel like I’d been robbed!

I bought a scale to help me dial in my shots, but my scale seems to lag. For example, if I want to hit 36g, I have to stop my machine around the time it says 32g to hopefully get close. Usually I manage to stop around 35 and end up with 42g out. I’ve managed to adjust the grind settings so that it still tastes OK, but is this something we’re all dealing with and just learn to live with or am I just being cheap and need to buy a more accurate scale? Lol.

I am new to a manual machine and am wondering how much that extra 6 or so grams makes a difference in the overall flavor profile/ if you have better scale rec’s? I’ll list what I do have below:

I used to be healthy-thin (5'5"" and around 140 lbs, but very fit from working out) with a naturally pear/hourglass body shape. However, since starting medical school and spending the past year sitting studying for boards, I've put on weight and now weigh around 156 lbs. My older sister is taller at 5'9"" with a rectangle body shape and used to be heavy but is currently 10-20 lbs heavier than I am, and my younger sister is my height with a rectangle body shape but overweight at around 180-185 lbs (I'm not fat shaming, we just are very open about our weight in my family so I don't mean to offend anyone! Also this is just for perception, please don't believe that the weights I say are too thin/too heavy/etc).

When my older sister was in college, she used to always get complimented by guys and was relatively active in the partying scene. She got complimented at grocery stores, parties, just a lot of places in general. I never really paid attention to it because at that time, I was young and didn't really care much. My younger sister gets hit on, as well, at work. She gets complimented on her hair, her smile, and so on. Just last week, she got asked out for coffee by her coworker.

I don't mean to sound conceited, but we've always been told we look similar and have similar features and such. I'm the type of person who enjoys attention (I feel like that stems from being raised in my culture where girls are told to ignore men and attention, and instead focus on your education and family. Please don't hate on me for this! I don't go out actively searching for attention or homewrecking or anything close to that, I just enjoy being complimented like any other girl!). I just feel really ugly and unwanted because I've never been outwardly complimented by a guy in my life, no matter what weight I was. I have friends, a likeable personality, I'm in medical school working on my degree, but I still feel so small and insignificant because of this. I'm probably overthinking this, but the fact that both my sisters and my friends and seemingly everyone around me gets complimented or asked out, and I have never been asked out or really caught the gaze of any guy, really gets into my mental space and creates a huge insecurity. Everyone around me has at least been asked out before or complimented by a man, if not dating, engaged, or married.

I don't want to invite unwanted attention, but just being asked by a single guy for coffee or complimented by a guy (or even catcalled, that's never happened to me either) would at least make me feel seen. Idk, I just feel so ugly compared to everyone and dumb because I'm lacking in something that literally every girl I know gets, and I really want some kind of male attention. Thoughts? Opinions? Advice? Please don't say anything hurtful, I don't explain my feelings well most of the time so what I'm saying might come off badly or wrong. I'm just trying to explain that I feel so unwanted and ugly, and I just want to be SEEN by a guy.",1,1746652724.0,women,0,1.0,False

I recently got my hands on a 2012 Furbacca, knowing good and well that the app that was previously realeased by Hasbro no longer works with modern Android. Thankfully I came across the amazing work of another Furby hobiest, bluesyncline on github and am currently porting the audio from the Furby commands, FurbyCmd II into audio files. My plan is to at least create an app that allows you to send commands to your Furby with a modern twist.

My plan is to give modern day Fruby parents/adopters the ability to give your Furby new life with things such as a cup of coffee or cruntchy sour candies, etc. Maybe a nice little ""gummy"" or two ::wink::. Now, these will only cause reactions on the Furby itself as I am unsure how to create the app to listen to the audio pitches (responses) and translate what the Furby sends back.

My understanding of the 2012 version, Boom (bare with me, as I havent had a Furby since the OG) is that Furby itself remembers things that it is given and develops a relationship with the user based on how the user treats it. While I may not be able to reproduce the pitches back from the Furby itself, I thought it would at least be a cool way to add a modern touch to current users. And a way to provide a ""cure"" when your Furby gets sick.

I guess my question is (and I HOPE I know the answer) is this an app that others would be interested in having as I am considering releasing the app as a sideloaded Android/iOS app. The thing about it is that I have to pay to realease the app for each platform, but cant charge for the app itself due to copyrights. So, it would have to be a tipping or ""cup of coffee"" situation.

Alright, everyone, let’s talk about a little something we all know too well: **meetings.** You know those endless hours you could be using to actually *get things done* instead of sitting in a room (or a Zoom call) wondering why you’re there? Yeah, I feel you. 🙄 

So, here’s a game-changer: the **“3-Question Rule.”** This is my secret weapon to help trim those back-to-back meetings down to size. 🎯 

### Here’s how it works:

Before you jump into any meeting, ask yourself (and maybe even the meeting organizer) these three simple questions: 

1. **What’s the purpose of this meeting?**
   - Seriously, if it’s just to check in on everyone’s weekend plans, I’m out!  
   - Is there a specific decision we need to make, or are we just sharing updates? 

2. **Who needs to be in this meeting?**
   - Are we dragging in people who really don’t need to be there? 
   - If they don’t have a role in the discussion, maybe send them a recap instead!

3. **What do we need to *decide* by the end?**
   - Let's keep it results-focused! 
   - If we can't identify a clear outcome, is this meeting really necessary?

### Why this works:

- **Clarity**: It gives everyone a clear reason to show up, and honestly, it keeps the chat focused. No more rambling for 30 minutes about last week’s episode of *The Office.* 
- **Engagement**: By defining roles and goals, you won't see the same faces zoning out halfway through. 
- **Time-Saving**: Trust me, just by implementing this rule, you could see a **60% reduction** in your meeting time! Imagine what you could do with that time... 

### A funny personal story:

I once found myself in a meeting that had absolutely no agenda. By the end of it, we were discussing *who makes the best café con leche* in town! 🤦‍♂️ I had to call in the “3-Question Rule” right after that, because let’s be honest—nobody's paying me for coffee recommendations.

Let’s be real: work can feel overwhelming at times, especially when we bog ourselves down with unnecessary check-ins and discussions. If we can free up even just one more hour in our work week, that’s time we could spend *actually working*, learning a new skill, or even just catching our breath!

So, have you tried the “3-Question Rule” yet? Or maybe you’ve found your own hacks to escape the meeting madness? Let’s share some laughs (and results) on this—after all, we’re in this together! 💪✨",1,1746652465.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Hey, MaximizeMe crew! So, I had one of those weeks where I felt like I was just *spinning my wheels*. You know, that chaotic whirlwind of deadlines, endless to-do lists, and a brain that felt like it was stuck on repeat? 😅

One night, after yet another long day of trying to chase down my thoughts while racing against time, I had a mini breakthrough. It all boiled down to this little 5-minute mental reset that *completely* changed the game for me. 

Let me break it down for you:

### **What’s the reset? 🤔**

Just a quick breather to hit pause. Sounds simple, right? But trust me, it’s super powerful. Here’s how I do it:

1. **Breathe Deep**: Close your eyes and take *three big breaths*. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Pretend you’re an inflatable pool toy letting all the air out (because who doesn’t love a visual?).
   
2. **Focus on One Thing**: Pick one thing you’re grateful for. It could be as simple as that perfect cup of coffee you had this morning or your favorite song playing on repeat. *Let that warm feeling wash over you*.

3. **Get Moving**: Stand up (or dance it out, if you’re feeling wild) for just a minute. Nothing crazy, just enough to shake off the cobwebs. Your brain loves it when you get the blood pumping!

4. **Transform Your Environment**: If possible, change your surroundings even a little. Move to another room, grab your laptop and sit on the floor, whatever helps. New perspective, fresh ideas!

5. **Set a Tiny Goal**: Instead of trying to tackle that massive project all at once, pick just one small task to complete. It could be as simple as drafting one sentence or finding one resource. Boom! You’ll feel a surge of accomplishment.

### **Why does this work? 🌈**

Ever feel like you're on autopilot? Yeah, same. Our brains can get overloaded, making us feel stuck—like you’re gunning it in hyperdrive with no brakes. But taking even FIVE minutes to reset can help clear the fog. 

Plus, let’s be real: who doesn’t love the feeling of accomplishment, even if it starts small? It’s like feeding your brain little bites of motivation instead of trying to tackle a whole buffet!

### **A little humor for good measure** 

The first time I tried this, I felt silly sitting on my floor like a lost kindergartner. But guess what? It worked! I ended up writing an entire section of my project that had been haunting me for weeks. Sometimes you just gotta embrace the absurdity, right? 

Have you ever felt like you’re stuck in hyperdrive? What’s your go-to way to hit that reset button? Keep the convo rolling, I’m all ears! 🎉✨",1,1746652456.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1kh8nbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/1kh8nbq/300k_in_debt_for_a_degree_i_am_not_using/,$300k in debt for a degree I am not using,"Hi. This is my first post. I’m graduating this saturday with a BFA in animation (and game arts), and I am $274,000 in debt. $27,000 of this is unsubsidized and subsidized federal loans. The rest is all Parent Plus, but we did this with the plan that I am repaying it off myself. My dad makes decent money for a family of four, but my mom is sick (and has been for years) and requires a lot of money for chemo/hospitals/etc. We have always planned for me to pay my dad the money entirely. My entire family and I went in unaware that it would not be connected to my income, despite it being my college degree. My dad never went to college, and I was stupidly uninformed- so when my school said the Parent Plus loan was my only true course of action- I believed them. They spoke against private loans, and said a Parent Plus wouldn’t affect me paying it off post-grad. Now knowing it is untransferable to become my name until I build a good credit, and the payments and are based on his income, I feel sick and horribly guilty. 

Last year, near the end of my junior year, I realized I am not passionate or good at animation. I was rejected from every internship, and I hated my work. I realized then that I was an extremely dumb, optimistic 18 year old who believed art college was the answer. I believed I would become a master animator in 4 years, live in California post grad, and make enough to life comfortably. When I realized how unrealistic this was, and how much I hated animation, I spoke to my academic counselor- saying I want to pivot to UX/UI Design. This major isn’t offered in my school, but I found I enjoyed it a lot more than animation. (And I still presently do) She encouraged me to keep my degree in animation. I believe this was because switching my major that late would lead to more years, and more debt. The past year I’ve been working with mentors and building my portfolio in UX/UI. My goal was to land my first internship right before I graduated, kickstarting my career. After months and months of applications, I have just been ghosted by my final possible internship. With this, I am leaving school with 0 internships and being stuck at a retail job that pays $17/hr. On top of this, I stupidly renewed my lease for another year, so I pay $600/month for housing. I did this before I knew how much I owed a month. 

Despite it being May, I’m still applying for internships, and less and less are getting back to me. Everyday I feel sick and stuck, terrified of graduating. I know how stupid I was, and I should’ve thought more carefully years ago. I genuinely feel so much guilt and regret, and stay up at night unable to stop thinking about the money I owe. 

My dad can’t do a loan consolidation to help lower the loans I pay him, because his income will increase the loan amount for me. I am using refund checks to pay him back for the next year while I am in this apartment. 

I have no idea what to do, and I feel hopeless. I haven’t slept well in months and spend every day working in retail, and coming home to apply for more jobs and schedule meetings with mentors. I network, cold email, have coffee chats— all you can think of. But, I’m still internship-less and scared. I don’t know what to do anymore other than keep building my portfolio and applying. I wrote all this in hopes for some kind of advice. I know I am stupid for my decisions, but now I can’t reverse anything. Thank you for anyone who took the time to read this.

1kh8mgg,https://macsources.com/jabra-evolve2-65-flex-wireless-headset-review/,Jabra Evolve2 65 Flex Wireless Headset REVIEW,"A reliable, travel-ready headset built for hybrid professionals, with premium features and a few comfort caveats.

I’ve been working from home for nearly five years, and during that time, I’ve come to learn just how important a reliable headset is to maintaining productivity and staying connected. Whether I’m in back-to-back video meetings or just trying to stay focused in a noisy environment, a good headset has become as essential to my setup as my laptop or internet connection. I’ve used everything from basic earbuds to high-end over-ear headphones, and each has its trade-offs. What I consistently look for is a combination of clear audio, dependable connectivity, and all-day comfort. With this in mind, I gave the [Jabra](https://macsources.com/?s=jabra) Evolve2 65 Flex a try since I’ve had good luck with Jabra products in the past.

The charging stand adds $69.00 to the list price. They can also be ordered through [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3EWZd0m).

# Unboxing

When it comes to packaging, Jabra rarely disappoints. The box for the Evolve2 65 has a branding wrap around it that features a colorful image of the product and a few high-level details. When you remove that, you’ll see a message printed on the actual box that reads, “It’s what’s inside that counts. (that’s why we’ve reduced our packaging)” Now, I don’t remember the last Jabra product I unboxed, but I do think the packaging is minimal.

There is a long explanation of Jabra’s efforts to reduce/reuse/recycle packaging inside the box. Ironically, this is on a separate piece of cardboard that could have been left out if the message was just printed on the box itself. There is a quick start guide printed on a separate piece of cardboard and then the headphones case. The case is soft-sided and is really only designed to hold the headset, its USB receiver, and a charging cable. I was, however, able to slip the wireless charging into the pouch as well.

# User Experience

# Over the past week, I’ve put this headset through its paces evaluating its design, comfort, sound performance, and connectivity. Below, you’ll find my detailed thoughts on how each aspect held up during real-world use.



**Design** I really appreciate the fold-flat feature of these headphones as well as their compact size. My go-to headphones are usually the Apple AirPods Max, which work, but aren’t nearly as compact as this Jabra set. In fact, I feel like travel and remote work is where these headphones really shine. They are easy to pack and even easier to grab-and-go when you need to.

**Comfort** The headset is lightweight, but I did find them a little hard to wear for long periods of time. Because they are on-ear style headphones, my ears got hot pretty quickly. Over-ear headphones have some air flow around the ear even though the ear is covered. On-ear headphones have caused some over-heating issues for my ears and it appears that the Evolve2 are not an exception. Aside from the temperature of my ears, the headset is comfortable to wear. The controls are easy to reach and intuitive. The ear cups are soft, but I think the headband could use some extra padding.

**Audio Quality (input and output)** I’ve used this headset for several online meetings and thought the incoming audio quality was just fine. I asked people on the other end how I sounded and they said, “Different, but not in a bad way.” I would rate the audio quality above average and I didn’t have any issues with Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or Google Meet. I am a big fan of being able to mute myself just by flipping the microphone up.



**Software Package**

As far as noise-cancellation goes, there is a button on the ear cup that switches between modes, and these headphones do have a hear-through function. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work as well as I hoped. The on-ear design of the headphones provides quite a bit of sound isolation and I still felt like the hear-through feature was muted. I could hear myself and ambient noise better than I could when ANC was turned on, but it wasn’t what I hope for with a hear through feature until I adjusted it in the Jabra Direct app.

**Connectivity** This is an area where I had some issues, but not with Bluetooth or the Receiver. I didn’t have any problems with my devices recognizing the headset’s connection methods, but I did have an issue where my MacBook Pro didn’t automatically switch to the Jabra headset as its primary input/output audio device. I had to manually switch it in System Settings.

The Jabra headset does have a companion app — Jabra Direct. It works really well, but it can only be downloaded directly from Jabra. My headset was immediately recognized by the app and all the firmware was updated quickly. As I mentioned above, I was able to adjust my side-tone/hear-through levels and even though I didn’t want to change any of the default button options, the ability exists there in the Jabra Direct app. It’s very easy to navigate.

# Conclusion

The Jabra Evolve2 65 Flex is a thoughtfully designed headset built for professionals who split their time between the home office and the road. Its compact, fold-flat design makes it incredibly travel-friendly, while features like hybrid ANC, flip-to-mute microphone, and multi-platform compatibility show that Jabra understands what remote workers need. While it’s not perfect, particularly in long-term comfort and default audio device switching on macOS, it gets far more right than wrong. If portability, professional-grade audio, and dependable connectivity are high on your list, this headset should be a strong contender.

The issue is that he’s completely invading my space and making me uncomfortable. I don’t want to be a personal relationship for him. He constantly walks over to my desk to show me breaking Trump news— especially if he knows it has negative implications for my husband’s job. The other day he showed me a video of a dog fight where someone repeatedly shoved their finger in the aggressive dog’s butt (then claimed he didn’t notice that detail even though the caption on the video describes this); he’s constantly telling me about his “shower thoughts” even after I suggested “coffee thoughts” would serve the same purpose, he’s memorized my license plate and looks to find my car outside of work. He constantly texts me outside of work. 

And then I think a major stressor that weighs heavily on me is the level of detail I get about his heart failure and the fact that he’s going to ignore his doctor’s recommendation to get a pacemaker. Apparently he hasn’t even fully disclosed this to his wife and he’s completely left her in the dark. What’s worse is that means if he dies before retiring, they will just pay out what he’s put in to retirement and she won’t have access to his benefits (pension/health insurance). 

Other than his wife, he has no kids or siblings alive. He doesn’t seem to have much of a social life and he keeps pushing back retirement as if he’s just going to hangout to have access to a relationship with me. 

I’m having trouble focusing because of the constant barrage of Trump shit as it is. My husband says I need to be nice to the “old man” because he’s probably just lonely, but to be honest, I didn’t sign up for all this. 

He walked in and said, “good morning, sunshine” and … I want to puke. 

No one is in this office with us. Something tells me on some level he recognizes he’s out of line but can’t help himself.

My name is Daniel Levine and I am a Rabbi and Jewish Studies Lecturer at UC Irvine teaching classes in Jewish thought, law, and history.

Last year I did an AMA here and it led to some great conversations both on reddit and IRL over coffee (I'm still in touch with some of you I met as a result of it) - so I figured I would do a round two!

Feel free to ask any/all questions about Judaism, the Jewish community, Zionism etc - the more the merrier. while I might be a bit slow, I promise to get to every question. I will also try the best I can to distinguish descriptions of things from my personal opinions so both are clear.

Critical discourse/civil disagreement is central to Jewish tradition so feel free to push back on anything I say and we can keep the conversation going - as long as it is in good faith. There's been both a plethora of misinformation about Judaism in the public sphere from many corners along with a general dearth of good faith/civil dialogue generally happening between people who disagree about life's big questions - so I hope this is a tiny step in the right direction!

I'm also generally happy to get coffee and discuss anything related. Just dm me :)

I've had a Philips 2200 for a few years. Great thing; lasted a couple years until the heating element was shot and it shorted (it was positioned beside the kettle, realised my mistake only after it broke)

Since today I have a Philips 3349/70 with the LatteGo option. Expecting a similar performance with the added bonus of the so called SilentBrew, I was very unpleasantly suprised with the noise of air being in the system. 

I followed the following steps to solve this issue:

* I've reinstalled the AquaClean filter
* I've reinstalled the AquaClean filter while keeping it submerged
* I've fitted a new AquaClean filter
* I've removed the AquaClean filter and put on a coffee, still makes the noise
* I've removed the AquaClean filter, put the resevoir back with water and outputted 3 hot water cups.
   * Suprisingly, this caused the machine to quit the noise and provide a noise I'd identify more with SilentBrew. Sadly, this is only relevant for when i'm getting hot water out of the machine, which I never do.
* Reset the machine, allowing it to do its initial start-up sequence again
* Removed the inner workings and checked the tubes for blockages.
* Checked the water resevoir and input in the machine for blockages.
* Put on many coffees to hopefully resolve the issue by just using it, but to no avail.
* I've lubricated the rubber rings behind the innerworkings which should act as a seal for the coffee to be sucked in (I suppose)

I've now rinsed the brew core and am waiting for it to dry to try again one last time before calling it quits.

  
If anyone has any tips  how to get air out of the system/reduce the noise so I don't have to send the entire thing back, please let me know!

As we age, it’s common to feel tired and worn out, which can affect our overall health. Many people also find it hard to lose weight, have slower metabolism, and notice early signs of aging. To keep up with a busy life and avoid feeling tired, Mitolyn might be the solution you need. Mitolyn Weight Loss is famous for its “Purple Peel Exploit” formula and is known as a secret behind the youthful fitness of Hollywood celebrities.

[Get the best deals and authentic products when you Buy Now From the Official Website.](https://e8260iq5f9c8csbiyn-e894r6s.hop.clickbank.net)

Imagine waking up full of energy without needing your morning coffee! This natural supplement helps fight common problems like tiredness, low energy, obesity, and early signs of aging. It works by regulating your energy levels to help you get through the day. Instead of giving you a quick caffeine boost, Mitolyn helps your body’s natural energy system, which can help maintain your weight and overall vitality.

**What is Mitolyn?**

Mitolyn is a natural weight loss supplement designed to help your body’s energy production and metabolism. Its main ingredient is the “Purple Peel Exploit” formula, which helps your body’s mitochondria—the cell’s energy producers. As we age or gain weight, the mitochondria in our cells become less efficient, causing low energy levels and weight gain. Mitolyn supports the mitochondria to work at their best, which can help with weight loss and increasing energy levels.

Mitolyn is unique because it doesn’t use caffeine or stimulants to give you energy. Instead, it works naturally by supporting your body’s energy production at the cellular level, giving you more energy, better fat burning, and a more youthful feeling. Mitolyn is an advanced weight loss formula for people struggling with obesity. It uses natural ingredients to boost metabolism and promote fat burning. Mitolyn helps you lose weight, restore energy levels, and stay fit without side effects.

**Why Mitolyn is Different**

Mitolyn stands out from other weight loss supplements. It doesn’t just suppress appetite or boost energy temporarily. Instead, it improves the mitochondria in your cells, which are essential for energy and metabolism.

**Why Mitolyn Works**

Mitochondria convert food into energy and burn fat. Over time, things like aging, stress, and poor diets can make mitochondria less efficient, affecting metabolism and making weight loss harder. Mitolyn’s formula is designed to enhance mitochondrial health, helping the body use fat as energy more effectively and supporting steady weight loss. Unlike many weight loss pills that increase body temperature or reduce appetite, Mitolyn works with your body’s natural processes to burn fat and boost overall health.

**Ingredients in Mitolyn**

1. **Maqui Berry:** This purple fruit is rich in antioxidants, which help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. This improves energy levels and fat burning while also supporting heart health.
2. **Rhodiola:** An herb known for reducing stress and fatigue. It helps create new mitochondria in cells, improving energy production and aiding weight management. It also boosts focus, mood, and cognitive function.
3. **Haematococcus (Astaxanthin):** A powerful antioxidant found in red algae that combats oxidative stress and inflammation, enhances metabolism, and supports joint health and the immune system.
4. **Amla (Indian Gooseberry):** High in Vitamin C and antioxidants, Amla improves mitochondrial function, supports digestion and metabolism, and helps reduce inflammation, making it a vital part of Mitolyn’s formula.

**Key Ingredients in Mitolyn’s Purple Peel Extract**

Why I Started Using MITOLYN

At 42, I felt older than I should.

I was tired all the time.

My focus was fading.

My joints ached.

I was gaining weight, even with moderate eating.

And worst of all, I was starting to lose my confidence.

Doctors told me it was just “aging” or “stress.” I wasn’t buying it. I wanted real answers and a real solution.

That’s when I discovered MITOLYN – a supplement designed to restore mitochondrial health (the energy factories inside your cells) and help fight fatigue, inflammation, and aging at the cellular level.

What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a science-backed, mitochondria-targeted health supplement. Its goal? To recharge your cells by improving mitochondrial function — which influences energy, metabolism, mental clarity, muscle performance, and even longevity.

Key benefits they promise:

Boost energy naturally

Improve focus and brain performance

Support healthy weight management

Reduce joint pain and inflammation

Fight cellular aging

To be honest, it felt like a too-good-to-be-true checklist. But I gave it a shot.

What’s Inside MITOLYN? (And Why It Matters)

What made MITOLYN stand out for me was the premium, research-backed ingredients that target real cellular health — not just superficial energy boosts like caffeine.

Some of the star ingredients include:

CoQ10 – Supports cellular energy and heart health

PQQ – Promotes the growth of new mitochondria

Acetyl-L-Carnitine – Improves mental clarity and memory

Alpha Lipoic Acid – Fights oxidative stress

Resveratrol – Powerful antioxidant with anti-aging properties

Magnesium, Zinc, Vitamin B12 – Essential for energy production

Together, these ingredients form a synergistic formula that targets the root cause of fatigue and aging — mitochondrial decline.

MITOLYN Complaints: What You Should Know

If you’re on the fence about buying MITOLYN, I urge you: *read my story*. It might just be the final push you need to experience what I now enjoy every single day—a vibrant, energized, healthy life I thought was behind me.

# 🚫 THE PROBLEM: Exhaustion, Fog, and Hopelessness​

Just six months ago, I was *barely functioning*.

I’m 44 years old—not ancient, but not in my twenties anymore either. I work full-time, take care of two kids, and try to juggle everything life throws at me. Somewhere in the past few years, I started noticing a decline. I wasn’t just “tired”—I was constantly exhausted. My mind felt foggy. My motivation was gone. I’d sleep for eight hours and wake up feeling like I hadn’t rested at all.

Doctors told me everything looked “fine.” Bloodwork normal. Nothing clinical.

But I didn’t *feel* fine.

I was losing interest in everything—work, hobbies, even family time. I wasn’t depressed in the traditional sense, but I was slipping into a version of myself I didn’t recognize. Something deeper was off.

I tried coffee, energy drinks, vitamins, diets—nothing worked.

That’s when I came across **MITOLYN**.

# 🔍 DISCOVERING MITOLYN: A Hidden Gem in the Wellness World​

I found MITOLYN in a biohacking forum, where someone mentioned it as a “game-changing mitochondrial support formula.” I had no idea what that meant at the time, but I started researching.

Turns out, MITOLYN is formulated to support **mitochondria**—the tiny powerhouses in our cells that produce energy. As we age, our mitochondria become less efficient, which leads to fatigue, mental fog, and a host of other symptoms most people chalk up to “getting older.”

But MITOLYN doesn’t just give you a temporary boost. It’s designed to **restore energy at the cellular level**. It’s packed with ingredients like CoQ10, NAD+ precursors, PQQ, and bio-optimized antioxidants—each one clinically backed and carefully dosed.

What impressed me even more was that MITOLYN had **no cheap fillers**, **no artificial junk**, and **transparent labeling**. Every capsule had a purpose.

I decided to give it a try. I figured I had nothing to lose.

# ✅ WEEK 1: Subtle Shifts I Couldn’t Deny​

The first few days were… surprisingly hopeful.

I didn’t feel a jolt of energy like I’d downed a triple espresso. But I *did* feel like my brain had cleared a bit. I was finishing emails faster. I wasn’t crashing in the afternoons.

By Day 5, I noticed something else—I was smiling more. I was less irritable with my kids.

That’s when I realized MITOLYN wasn’t just helping me feel “awake.” It was helping me feel **alive**.

# ✅ WEEK 2–4: A Transformation in Real-Time​

By the third week, my energy levels were *off the charts*. I wasn’t jittery or wired—I was just *consistently on*.

My workouts, which I had nearly given up on, became enjoyable again. I was lifting more, running farther, and waking up the next day feeling *recovered*, not wrecked.

Mentally, I was sharper than I’d been in years. I was writing faster, solving problems quicker, and remembering things effortlessly. My friends and coworkers even started commenting:

# ❤️ THE EMOTIONAL SIDE: Getting Me Back​

It’s easy to talk about improved energy, better sleep, or mental clarity. But what MITOLYN gave me goes beyond that.

It gave me **myself** back.

I laugh more. I’m more patient with my children. I look forward to my mornings. I have energy in the evenings for hobbies, not just survival. My passion for life has returned.

You don’t realize how much being tired all the time takes away from you—until you’re not tired anymore.

# 🧬 THE SCIENCE IS LEGIT​

MITOLYN isn’t just some trendy supplement with a fancy label. The science behind it is solid.

**Every ingredient has a purpose:**

* **CoQ10**: Crucial for ATP production, powering every cell in your body.
* **NAD+ Precursors (like NMN or NR)**: Help reverse mitochondrial aging.
* **PQQ**: Promotes the growth of *new* mitochondria—literally regenerating your energy engines.
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine**: Supports brain and nerve health.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid**: A master antioxidant, great for reducing inflammation.

These ingredients aren’t just thrown together—they’re dosed based on actual research. MITOLYN clearly invested in **real formulation**—not hype.

# 💯 VALUE FOR MONEY: Worth Every Cent​

Yes, MITOLYN isn’t the cheapest supplement out there. But I learned the hard way that *cheap doesn’t mean effective*.

When I calculated how much I was spending on energy drinks, multivitamins, snacks to stay awake, and missed productivity—it was clear: MITOLYN actually saved me money.

Plus, the quality is pharmaceutical-grade. You *feel* the difference.

**Pricing: Is Mitolyn Worth It?**

At $59 per bottle, Mitolyn is a premium supplement, but bulk packages offer significant savings:

**Price per Bottle**

1 Bottle $59.00

3 Bottles $147.00

6 Bottles $234.00

**➢Visit to Official Website: Check Availability In Your Country🌍**

Considering the quality of the ingredients and results, I found the investment worthwhile.

# ⭐ FINAL THOUGHTS: A 1000-Star Product​

If I could give MITOLYN more than 5 stars, I would.

This isn’t just a supplement—it’s a **life enhancer**.

Whether you’re a burnt-out parent, an overworked professional, or someone who just wants to feel better again, **MITOLYN is the answer** you didn’t know existed.

I’ve recommended it to friends, family, coworkers—and now I’m recommending it to you.

**Don’t wait.**  
Don’t let another week of fog, fatigue, and frustration go by.  
**Buy MITOLYN.** Experience the transformation.  
Get your life back—because you deserve to *feel amazing*.

Why I Started Using MITOLYN

At 42, I felt older than I should.

I was tired all the time.

My focus was fading.

My joints ached.

I was gaining weight, even with moderate eating.

And worst of all, I was starting to lose my confidence.

Doctors told me it was just “aging” or “stress.” I wasn’t buying it. I wanted real answers and a real solution.

That’s when I discovered MITOLYN – a supplement designed to restore mitochondrial health (the energy factories inside your cells) and help fight fatigue, inflammation, and aging at the cellular level.

What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a science-backed, mitochondria-targeted health supplement. Its goal? To recharge your cells by improving mitochondrial function — which influences energy, metabolism, mental clarity, muscle performance, and even longevity.

Key benefits they promise:

Boost energy naturally

Improve focus and brain performance

Support healthy weight management

Reduce joint pain and inflammation

Fight cellular aging

To be honest, it felt like a too-good-to-be-true checklist. But I gave it a shot.

What’s Inside MITOLYN? (And Why It Matters)

What made MITOLYN stand out for me was the premium, research-backed ingredients that target real cellular health — not just superficial energy boosts like caffeine.

Some of the star ingredients include:

CoQ10 – Supports cellular energy and heart health

PQQ – Promotes the growth of new mitochondria

Acetyl-L-Carnitine – Improves mental clarity and memory

Alpha Lipoic Acid – Fights oxidative stress

Resveratrol – Powerful antioxidant with anti-aging properties

Magnesium, Zinc, Vitamin B12 – Essential for energy production

Together, these ingredients form a synergistic formula that targets the root cause of fatigue and aging — mitochondrial decline.

No crash in the afternoon like before

✅ Week 2:

Woke up before my alarm — feeling refreshed

Digestion felt smoother

Less brain fog

I started to feel “lighter”

✅ Week 3:

I could focus better at work for longer periods

My workouts improved — less joint pain

I noticed a mood boost too — more optimistic

Real Benefits I Noticed with MITOLYN

MITOLYN Complaints: What You Should Know

No review is honest without mentioning the downsides — and yes, MITOLYN has a few:

1. Not Instant

You won’t feel anything miraculous on day 1. This isn’t a “quick fix” — it’s a science-backed long-term upgrade.

2. Premium Price

It’s not the cheapest supplement, especially if you compare it to generic multivitamins. But when you look at the ingredients, the research, and the real impact — it’s worth the investment.

3. Limited Stock

[Get the best deals and authentic products when you Buy Now From the Official Website.](https://e8260iq5f9c8csbiyn-e894r6s.hop.clickbank.net)

This actually frustrated me: MITOLYN sells out often. I tried to reorder in week 4 and had to wait 7 days. If you're buying, I recommend getting 2–3 bottles upfront.

Is MITOLYN Worth It in 2025?

Absolutely, yes.

If you’re:

Feeling constantly tired

Struggling with brain fog or poor memory

Battling joint pain

Gaining unwanted weight

Or just feel like you're “aging too fast”

Then MITOLYN can literally be the missing piece in your daily routine.

Unlike cheap energy boosters, MITOLYN works deep inside your cells to fix what’s broken. That’s why the results are real and lasting.

Final Verdict: Should You Buy MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is not a gimmick.

It’s a premium, advanced mitochondria support supplement that delivers real results. I’ve tried dozens of products over the years — but nothing has made me feel this recharged, balanced, and confident.

If you’re serious about taking control of your health in 2025 — MITOLYN is the #1 product I recommend. Period.

He’s honestly super sweet, but he has this obsession with bragging about only drinking water, black coffee, and the occasional beer. Totally fine and I get it!

However, I love coffee with oat milk. Most days I have a coffee with a splash of oat creamer. Think 1 tablespoon. But I spent the weekend with him and all 3 days I had an iced latte with oat milk. He kept telling me that oat milk is very unhealthy and I’m going to get diabetes. The first time I told him “Mehh if oat milk kills me then so be it.” I’ve heard it’s bad for various reasons, (not sure how true this is) but either way, don’t think 8oz of oat milk 3 days in a row will hurt me. 

The next day we went to a coffee shop and I ordered an iced latte with oat milk and vanilla. I KNOW that vanilla syrup is sugary. I fully know this. But he made fun of me again and said that’s so bad for you. I told him to stop because it’s starting to feel like he’s insulting my weight or something. He said “that’s ridiculous, you’re hot. I just wanted to make sure you know it’s bad for you.”

I’m so weirded out by this. For the record, I don’t have lattes everyday. Like I said I usually just have coffee with a bit of creamer. The lattes are like once a week usually, I just had 3 lattes this weekend because I wanted to.

TLDR; My FWB won’t let me drink an oatmilk latte without telling me how bad it is for me. When I tell him I know/don’t care, he continues to tell me. I feel like he’s being strange, but maybe I need to get over it. ",153,1746650116.0,relationship_advice,295,0.78,False

I don’t want three scoops, I want you to go to hell, go to hell, you sucker!” And I told him that he will pay for this, so I said to the producers to cut that scene because I don’t want people to know that I eat three scoops of ice cream every day, ok? I only eat two scoops every day! I don’t eat three scoops! I eat two! That’s right, you heard me! I eat two scoops!

1kh7tw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingSpacesHub/comments/1kh7tw8/uncover_how_lucas_oil_10514_stands_out_as_the/,Uncover How Lucas Oil 10514 Stands Out as the Best Interior Detailer Review,"Using the Lucas Oil 10514 Slick Mist Interior Detailer has been a surprisingly enjoyable experience, even for someone as nitpicky as me when it comes to keeping a clean car interior. Being someone who spends far too much time in their vehicle—between commutes, road trips, and endless coffee runs—keeping my interior looking fresh has always been important to me. This product, which came recommended by a friend, has quickly become a staple in my cleaning arsenal.

**Performance and Effectiveness**

Testing this interior detailer on various surfaces gives you an immediate sense of its versatility. It works on vinyl, plastic, leather, rubber, and even metal. I don’t know about you, but keeping track of multiple cleaning products for every car surface can be overwhelming. In one weekend cleaning binge, I sprayed it on my dashboard, door trims, and even my leather seats. Its performance? Stellar. It leaves behind a clean and non-greasy finish that doesn’t feel too slick or overly glossy. The shine looks factory-new without that fake polishy appearance. Plus, it does a solid job of lifting fingerprints, smudges, and the unidentifiable grime that appears out of nowhere.

**Ease of Use**

This spray makes cleaning painless—perfect for lazy Sundays or in-between detailing touches. The nozzle disperses the right amount of product, and a microfiber cloth is all you need to spread and buff. The fact that it acts as both a cleaner and protectant means I don’t have to double back with another product. Time saved is a big win in my book, considering how frequently I end up wiping down my interior thanks to my kids’ sticky fingers and our dog’s less-than-pristine car rides.

[Grab Lucas Oil 10514 Slick Mist Interior Detailer at the best price on Amazon.](https://interiorsblog.com/p/b008rwaagm/)

**Packaging and Build Quality**

At first glance, the 24 fl oz bottle might look fairly standard, but that’s not a bad thing. It’s lightweight, and the shape of the bottle fits well in your hand, making it easy to maneuver. The ergonomic trigger spray lid never clogged or dripped during use, which has been an issue with some similar detailing products I've tried in the past. Plus, you receive six bottles in a pack, so you can store the extras away for the long haul, which is especially useful for car care enthusiasts like myself.

**Positives**

- Cleans and protects multiple surfaces, from dashboards to leather seats.  
- Leaves a non-greasy, natural finish that enhances the original look of materials.  
- Ergonomic spray bottle prevents drips and makes application hassle-free.  
- Time-efficient solution with cleaning and protecting in one step.  

**Limitations**

No product gets away without a few critiques, and this detailer is no exception. While the results are undeniably impressive, certain improvements could make this process even better.

- The scent might not appeal to everyone. Though it's not overly strong, sensitive noses might wish for more neutral or varied scent options.  
- Some users might find the finish slightly too shiny on surfaces where they prefer a matte look.    
- Not ideal for heavier cleaning needs beyond typical maintenance. If you have deeply ingrained stains on certain materials, you may need something stronger first.  

**Challengers**

Comparing this product with a similar option, like Meguiar’s Quik Interior Detailer, revealed both strengths and weaknesses. The Lucas Oil detailer excels at leaving a richer, glossier protective layer without feeling greasy, whereas Meguiar’s might suit those preferring a completely matte finish. Another competitor would be the Chemical Guys InnerClean Interior Quick Detailer, which offers a pleasantly mild scent, but it doesn’t quite deliver on protecting surfaces as robustly as Lucas Oil 10514.

While the other brands perform well in specific areas, neither matches this product’s all-in-one approach for households juggling pets, kids, and everyday use. It’s a balance of ease, effectiveness, and protection that gives it an edge.

**Value for Money**

For someone always looking for good deals on car detailing products, this one impresses. It’s rare to find products that deliver both multi-surface cleaning and reliable protection within this price range. You get a pack of six, giving you enough product to last months, if not years, depending on your usage. Factor in the effort it saves and its high compatibility across surfaces, and it becomes a financially sound choice. The materials aren’t cheap, yet I wasn’t left feeling guilty from an overspend—quite the opposite.

Nestled deep within the Boreal forest, Pine Hollow Cabin is the perfect retreat for guests seeking tranquility, fresh air, and a break from the hustle and bustle of city life. The cabin sits at the edge of a quiet clearing, surrounded by towering spruce and pine trees that sway gently in the wind. A small creek runs behind the property, providing a soothing soundtrack to your mornings.

Enjoy your morning coffee on the covered porch while watching deer pass through the mist, or cozy up by the woodstove after a long hike on one of the nearby trails. The cabin is off-grid but fully stocked with all modern amenities, including a gas lantern, solar shower, and a carefully curated collection of vintage books and board games. Perfect for couples, solo adventurers, or anyone needing a peaceful rest.

Before settling in, please take a moment to review our **House Rules** to ensure a safe and pleasant stay.

**House Rules for Guests:**

1. Check-in is at 3:00 p.m. sharp. Do not arrive earlier. The cabin is not ready for guests until exactly 3:00.  
2. Please do not adjust the antique grandfather clock in the living room. It keeps time differently and is not to be tampered with.  
3. Do not use the mirror in the master bedroom after sunset. It does not reflect this world properly after dark.  
4. Ignore the man outside the kitchen window. He does not belong to this property.  
5. You may hear knocking between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m. from under the floorboards. This is normal. Do not investigate.  
6. The forest path behind the cabin is off-limits after dusk. If you see someone walking it anyway, close and lock all windows. Do not call out to them. Do not wave.  
7. Keep the front door locked at all times. Even if you hear your own voice asking to be let back in.  
8. If you find a second guestbook in the nightstand drawer, do not read it out loud.  
9. Under no circumstances should you sleep in the cabin for more than three consecutive nights. The house begins to remember.  
10. Check out is at 11:00 a.m. sharp. If the house offers you “one more night,” politely decline. It does not give second chances.

We hope you enjoy your stay!

And how do I do it nicely?,"So this guy, I'll call him 'K' (15M), has been hanging around my group of friends at lunch. In my high school, we have a smoking pit that's just a zoned-off area outside for people to smoke and vape. Me and my friends regularly sit in this zoned area while they vape. Recently K has been sitting in our group circle and chatting while he vapes, which I don't mind. He is a bit weird as he constantly talks about hacking, but I really don't mind. The thing that I mind and that makes me not want to talk to him or have him around is that he mansplains and if he doesn't than he's talking about something he clearly doesn't know anything about and plays it off as if he does.

Me and K went to the same middle school and have had a class together. He has, on two occasions, mansplained.

The first time was last term in English. I was high, so I was very 'whatever's on my mind, I'm gonna chat about'. And so when my work slowed a bit, I started a conversation with one of my friends. I don't remember the TikTok that the conversation was based off of, by me, but it had something to do with the sexual holes on women. I believe that it was about, there being 4 that could be used for activities. At some point he joined the conversation and informed me that there were in fact, 5 holes. I tried to correct him, but that just started a small debate-like argument, where he kept telling me, a woman of 15 years, that I was incorrect, and that there was in fact a small, visible hole between the front door and the back door of a woman, because he saw it in a textbook.

The second time, I was talking about ADHD meds, as I have ADHD and thought my morning order of decaf coffee got mixed up with a caffeinated one instead. I was explaining that stimulants like caffeine, nicotine, and weed can cause a negative effect when taken with the meds. To which he cut me off and said that ADHD meds were supposed to calm an ADHDer. I explained that ADHD meds are stimulants, and taking stimulants with stimulants could make an ADHD person more hyper. To which he then 'corrected me' again with his statement.

It's not just me, as my whole friend group, of women, don't like him either, as he mansplains to them too and makes us all uncomfortable. I really want to tell him to fuck off but he hasn't done anything that would warrant me to be rude to him, other then mansplaining on only the two occasions, bragging about something he clearly couldn't do, and telling false information to a conversation I was having about getting my M1.

This elegant kitchen sink accessory doesn't just blend functionality but also adds aesthetic appeal to my kitchen setup. Its brushed nickel finish not only gives it a sleek look but also resists smudges and fingerprints, which has proven ideal for someone like me who's constantly in the kitchen cooking or cleaning.

**Ease of Installation and Setup**  
Can I take a moment to gush about how stress-free the installation was? The product comes with two sizes of quick-connect fittings (1/4""x7/16"" and 3/8""x7/16""), making it fit snugly into most water filtration setups. Even for someone who isn't a DIY master, I found the single-hole installation quite straightforward. I had it paired with my iSpring under-sink filtration system, and it was up and running in no time—definitely a win for its user-friendly design.  
[Check Water Filter Tec ASINB0747M6HYN price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0747m6hyn/)

**Performance and Water Quality**  
Once installed, the difference in water quality hit me immediately. It truly amplifies the flavor of my drinking water, offering a crisp, clean taste. I have peace of mind knowing that the faucet is completely NSF/ANSI-certified and lead-free, ensuring safer, healthier water. Whether I'm preparing soups, brewing coffee, or simply filling a water bottle, the faucet ensures clarity and freshness every single time.

**Advantages**  
- Elegant brushed nickel finish resists fingerprints and smudges.  
- Straightforward installation with included fittings.  
- Enhances water taste and safety with NSF certification.  

**Design and Functionality**  
This faucet isn’t just about looks, although its streamlined brushed nickel finish does impeccably complement my kitchen decor. It offers a smooth-turning handle, which feels sturdy yet operates effortlessly, and the 360° swivel function makes accessing the sink basin a breeze, no matter the angle. It's a design that clearly takes functionality into account without sacrificing style.

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Highly durable with an impressive build quality.  
- 360° swivel offers versatility and convenience.  
- Perfectly pairs style with practicality.  

**Drawbacks**  
However, every product has its imperfections, right? Here are a couple of sticking points I discovered during my testing:  
- It’s a non-air gap faucet. While this doesn’t affect its functionality, some might prefer the additional safety of an air gap feature when it comes to preventing backflow.  
- The brushed nickel coating, while beautiful, does require occasional polishing to maintain its pristine shine.  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to other popular brands like Moen and Pfister, this reverse osmosis faucet stands tall in terms of NSF certification and lead-free safety features. Yet Moen’s air gap models offer a slightly more superior edge in preventing cross-contamination. Aesthetically, though, the brushed nickel finish here feels more modern and less prone to wear over time, making it a solid competitor depending on what matters most to the consumer: safety nuances or sleek design.

**Value for Money**  
From a price-to-quality ratio, this faucet truly offers exceptional value. Its blend of safety certifications, versatile compatibility with all major RO systems (APEC, iSpring, Express Water), and stylish design makes it worth the investment. For anyone seeking safer and reliably purified water alongside a modern kitchen setup, this product hits the sweet spot.

(UK)","TL;DR it feels weird, lonely and depressing being in your 20s with a severe food allergy when most of your 'representation' comes via worst-case scenarios in the news, or very anxious Instagram accounts run by parents. And there are loads of us! If anyone's in this situation in the UK I'd love to link up and get a proper group together.

I'm 23f and a young professional based in London - I've had a severe dairy allergy since birth and have slightly milder reactions to some nuts. I felt very isolated at school because of it and I think that's still affecting me now. I don't have issues making friends anymore but there always is some residual fear that I'll scare them away if I talk too much about it. Navigating work meetings with food/coffee is a new thing, I've found lots of workarounds and never actually come up against hostility but it always feels really weird. I'm working on being confident and assertive (my next goal is to scout around for restaurants that work for me and to always be the one suggesting places) but it's hard work when you've got confidence issues already.

I was recently on an allergy charity's page on Insta and I found a comment from a girl near my age who also had a dairy allergy - I clicked on the profile out of curiosity and I think it actually fixed me lol. She was so cool and pretty and clearly living a very social, full life, the sort I always secretly thought I could NEVER have as an adult! Getting into relationships, going to cafes and restaurants all the time, travelling, etc. She even had an 'aesthetic' photo with her asthma inhalers on her feed (I'm always hiding mine from people, not even sure why at this point). Just learning about how other people are managing their conditions in a fun and confident way makes me feel so much better. I so badly wanted to DM her but it would have been weird going from a random comment! 

It struck me that the only other time I saw representation of other young people with my condition it was after they had died from reactions and hit the mainstream media! And that's going to be such a small percentage of allergic young adults - fatal reactions are actually VERY RARE, and there are probably hundreds of thousands of us in most Western countries who live full and functional lives. We just don't know we're there lol! Allergies are way more common in this generation than in any other. But it obviously really messes with your self-image and state of mind to only ever relate to people who have had the worst outcome. 

I find that a lot of 'allergy influencers' in the UK, and maybe the USA/Canada too, are actually non-allergic parents of very young children. It's so cool that they're out there and agitating on their behalf, but I always feel like these accounts are more stressful than comforting to read - they bring back a lot of really bad memories from my childhood and put me into a hypervigilant headspace (of course this is necessary in certain situations, but not at literally all waking hours lol). And being an adult in control of a child is very different to being an adult yourself, and keeping mental health in check while using your own initiative to navigate work/relationships/risk tolerance. I've never had these convos with people my own age and it would be so nice to.

If there are other UK twentysomethings navigating their adult life with a severe food allergy (esp. if it's to dairy haha), I would LOVE to form some sort of community, whether offline/offline. It would help so much with my own confidence and mental health and I'm sure it would help others too. Please DM and if there's interest I will make some sort of group chat if people are comfortable with it.

I'm wondering if anyone else is experiencing problems with the new UI 7 on their Samsung Galaxy phones, specifically the S24+?

I was putting off on updating and finally did recently and also  got another push or recent update late last night or this morning, May 7, 2025, I woke up and accepted/finalized the install in my zombie state pre-coffee... and I've been having two major issues:

1. **Rapid Battery Drain:** My battery is draining significantly faster than before the update.
2. **Charging and USB-C Port Problems:**
   * After finishing the update install this morning, my phone initially stopped charging altogether.
   * I tried multiple chargers with no recognition.
   * After wiping the partition cache several times (5-7 times) and restarting multiple times, the USB-C port now recognizes chargers.
   * However, when I plug in *any* charger, it gives two audible dings and shows as connected, but **no actual charging is happening.**
   * Currently, my battery has drained 5% while connected to a fast charger.
   * The USB-C port is also **not recognizing other accessories**, such as my Backbone controller and wired headphones.

I contacted Samsung support via text, and after several dropped chats and unhelpful agents, I received a generic, scripted response about future updates.

""I am sorry that you've had to deal with this. please be advised that Samsung is continuously working on improving and expanding the software of our devices so please stay tuned for updates from time to time."" - Samsung\_Agent

**Has anyone found a workaround or solution for either the rapid battery drain or, more importantly, the inability to charge via the USB-C port (other than wireless charging)?**

Hey, I’m Mia! I’m offering a girlfriend experience that’s centered around authentic connection, not just a transactional dynamic. I’m someone who truly values real chemistry and meaningful conversations that feel natural and fulfilling. This isn’t about “going through the motions” for me. Im not looking to play a role, I wont put on a show and not interested in playing pretend. I love to laugh, and I want someone I can really laugh with, I’m talking about that real - genuine - stomach hurts - spit your coffee out - type of laughter 😆 . A girlfriend experience with me looks like those kinds of laughs, often. It looks like having someone you can talk to, confide in, and share honest, genuine experiences with.

Let’s be real, “spicy” content can be bought anywhere and most of it is free to look at anyway lol. I don’t want someone who prioritizes that over meaningful connection. connection is the real luxury, here. I’d like to do this with someone who understands that, and someone who wants to connect with me emotionally and intimately. Yes, we’ll have an “understanding” - but I’m looking for something that feels less like a transaction and more like a real connection. The kind where we both feel seen, supported, and appreciated.

Outside of this, my life is really fulfilling. Im career oriented, but in my spare time I’m probably enjoying an Italian dinner w/ family, on a hike w/ my pups, hitting the beach in the summer, binge watching a show, or curled up on the couch (in oversized sweats) reading a book or writing my novel. I thrive on good energy & spontaneous adventures. If you like a woman who’s full of life, a little bold, and always ready to lift you up, hey..we might just click. Im a social butterfly, but I also get along with people who are more introverted. It would be cool to do this with someone who matches my energy, but sometimes the best connections are the ones where opposites balance each other out. 

Overall..I’m down to earth, low drama, and I like to think I bring something different to the table. I pride myself on being real and one of a kind. If you’ve actually read this far, chances are you’re exactly the kind of person I’d love to hear from.

# Best Coffee Cup Sleeves 2025: Top Brands Reviewed

Coffee cup sleeves, often overlooked, play a crucial role in our daily lives. These simple yet essential accessories protect our hands from scorching hot beverages, prevent condensation from making a mess, and offer a sustainable alternative to double-cupping. With the rise of specialty coffee and the increasing awareness of environmental concerns, the demand for high-quality and eco-friendly coffee cup sleeves has surged. This review will explore the best coffee cup sleeves available in 2025, highlighting top brands and their unique features.

[[Browse top-rated coffee cup sleeves on Amazon]](https://itsallgarden.com/baby-care/?kw=coffee+cup+sleeves)
 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality of a coffee cup sleeve depends on several key features. These include insulation effectiveness, material durability, size compatibility, grip, and environmental impact. A superior sleeve effectively insulates, is durable enough to withstand daily use, fits a range of cup sizes, offers a secure grip, and is made from sustainable materials.

**Insulation Effectiveness:**

The primary function of a coffee cup sleeve is to insulate the user's hand from the heat of the beverage. Effective insulation depends on the thickness and material composition of the sleeve. Sleeves made from corrugated cardboard or layered materials generally offer superior insulation compared to thinner, single-layer options. High-quality sleeves can maintain a comfortable hand temperature even with extremely hot drinks, minimizing the risk of burns or discomfort.

**Material Durability:**

Durability is a critical factor in determining the lifespan and overall value of a coffee cup sleeve. Sleeves made from high-quality, tear-resistant materials are less likely to rip or degrade with repeated use. Corrugated cardboard, known for its strength and resilience, is a popular choice for durable sleeves. Sleeves designed for reuse often feature reinforced edges and water-resistant coatings to enhance their longevity.

**Size Compatibility:**

Coffee cups come in a variety of sizes, from small espresso cups to large travel mugs. A versatile coffee cup sleeve should be compatible with a range of cup sizes to accommodate different beverage preferences. Sleeves with adjustable designs or stretchable materials offer greater flexibility in terms of size compatibility. Some manufacturers provide sleeves in multiple sizes to ensure a snug and secure fit for specific cup dimensions.

**Grip:**

A secure grip is essential for preventing accidental spills and ensuring a comfortable holding experience. Sleeves with textured surfaces or non-slip coatings provide enhanced grip, even when the cup is wet or condensation is present. Some sleeves feature ergonomic designs that conform to the shape of the hand, further improving grip and reducing the risk of dropping the cup.

**Environmental Impact:**

With growing environmental awareness, the sustainability of coffee cup sleeves has become increasingly important. Eco-friendly sleeves are typically made from recycled materials, biodegradable materials, or compostable materials. Some manufacturers offer sleeves made from plant-based fibers, such as bamboo or sugarcane, which are renewable and sustainable alternatives to traditional paper products. Choosing eco-friendly sleeves helps reduce waste and minimizes the environmental impact of disposable coffee accessories.

 ## Core Benefits

Coffee cup sleeves offer a range of practical benefits that enhance the coffee-drinking experience. These benefits include hand protection, improved grip, condensation prevention, branding opportunities, and environmental responsibility. By addressing these needs, coffee cup sleeves provide a valuable service to both consumers and businesses.

**Hand Protection:**

The most immediate benefit of a coffee cup sleeve is protecting the user's hand from the heat of hot beverages. Without a sleeve, holding a hot cup of coffee can be uncomfortable or even painful, especially for extended periods. Sleeves provide a layer of insulation that prevents burns and allows users to comfortably enjoy their drinks without discomfort.

**Improved Grip:**

Coffee cup sleeves enhance grip, making it easier to hold and transport hot beverages. The textured surface or non-slip coating of many sleeves provides a secure hold, even when the cup is wet or condensation is present. This reduces the risk of accidental spills and makes it easier to carry multiple cups at once.

**Condensation Prevention:**

Condensation can be a nuisance, creating a slippery surface and potentially damaging furniture or clothing. Coffee cup sleeves help prevent condensation by absorbing moisture and creating a barrier between the cold cup and the surrounding environment. This keeps hands dry and prevents water rings from forming on surfaces.

**Branding Opportunities:**

For businesses, coffee cup sleeves offer a valuable branding opportunity. Sleeves can be customized with logos, slogans, and other marketing messages, turning a simple accessory into a mobile advertisement. Branded sleeves enhance brand visibility and create a professional image for coffee shops and restaurants.

**Environmental Responsibility:**

Choosing eco-friendly coffee cup sleeves demonstrates a commitment to environmental responsibility. Sleeves made from recycled, biodegradable, or compostable materials help reduce waste and minimize the environmental impact of disposable coffee accessories. This resonates with environmentally conscious consumers and enhances a brand's reputation for sustainability.

 ## FAQs Section

Consumers often have questions about coffee cup sleeves, including their compatibility with different cup sizes, their reusability, and their environmental impact. Addressing these questions helps consumers make informed decisions and choose the best sleeves for their needs.

**Are coffee cup sleeves recyclable?**

The recyclability of coffee cup sleeves depends on the material they are made from and the recycling facilities available in your area. Sleeves made from recycled paper are generally recyclable, but sleeves with plastic coatings or linings may not be. It's best to check with your local recycling program to determine whether coffee cup sleeves are accepted.

**Can coffee cup sleeves be reused?**

Some coffee cup sleeves are designed for reuse, while others are intended for single-use only. Reusable sleeves are typically made from durable materials like silicone or neoprene and can be washed and reused multiple times. Single-use sleeves are generally made from paper or cardboard and are not designed for repeated use.

**Are there any biodegradable or compostable coffee cup sleeves?**

Yes, there are several biodegradable and compostable coffee cup sleeve options available. These sleeves are typically made from plant-based materials like bamboo, sugarcane, or recycled paper and will break down naturally over time. Look for sleeves that are certified compostable by a reputable organization.

**Do coffee cup sleeves really make a difference in terms of heat protection?**

Yes, coffee cup sleeves provide a significant level of heat protection. The insulation provided by the sleeve prevents direct contact between the hot cup and your hand, reducing the risk of burns and discomfort. The effectiveness of the sleeve depends on the material and thickness, with corrugated cardboard and layered materials offering the best insulation.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best lactose-free coffee creams boast a range of features that contribute to their overall quality and appeal.

**Plant-Based Formulation**

Many of the top lactose-free coffee creams are formulated with plant-based ingredients, such as oat milk, almond milk, coconut milk, or soy milk. These bases provide a naturally sweet and creamy texture without any dairy. The choice of plant-based milk influences the overall flavor profile, so consider what pairs best with your preferred coffee roast.

**Fortified with Vitamins and Minerals**

Some lactose-free creamers are fortified with essential vitamins and minerals like calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B12. This added nutritional value can be a significant benefit, especially for those who follow a vegan or plant-based diet and may need to supplement these nutrients. Checking the nutrition label for added vitamins and minerals is a good way to ensure you're getting more than just flavor from your creamer.

**Variety of Flavors and Sweeteners**

Lactose-free coffee creams come in a wide array of flavors, from classic vanilla and hazelnut to more adventurous options like caramel macchiato and peppermint mocha. The type of sweetener used also varies, with some brands opting for natural sweeteners like cane sugar, stevia, or monk fruit, while others use artificial sweeteners. Consider your personal preferences and dietary needs when selecting a flavor and sweetener.

**Carrageenan-Free Options**

Carrageenan is a common thickening agent used in many dairy-free products. However, some individuals experience digestive issues related to carrageenan consumption. Fortunately, there are many lactose-free coffee creams available that are formulated without carrageenan, offering a gentler option for sensitive stomachs.

**Shelf-Stable and Refrigerated Options**

Lactose-free coffee creams are available in both shelf-stable and refrigerated formats. Shelf-stable creamers are convenient for travel and pantry storage, while refrigerated options often offer a fresher taste and texture. Consider your lifestyle and storage space when choosing between these two formats.

 ## Core Benefits

Choosing the right lactose-free coffee cream can significantly improve your coffee-drinking experience and overall well-being.

Switching to a lactose-free alternative allows you to indulge in your coffee ritual without sacrificing your digestive health.

**Dietary Flexibility:** Lactose-free coffee creams open up a world of possibilities for those following vegan, vegetarian, or dairy-free diets. They provide a delicious and satisfying way to enhance your coffee without compromising your dietary choices.

**Reduced Calorie and Fat Content:** Many lactose-free coffee creams are lower in calories and fat compared to traditional dairy creamers. This can be a significant benefit for those who are watching their weight or trying to reduce their intake of saturated fat.

**Enhanced Flavor Profiles:** The diverse range of flavors available in lactose-free coffee creams can elevate your coffee-drinking experience. From subtle hints of vanilla to bold bursts of caramel, there's a lactose-free creamer to suit every palate.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about lactose-free coffee cream:

**Are all plant-based coffee creamers lactose-free?**
Yes, all coffee creamers made with plant-based milks like almond, oat, coconut, or soy are inherently lactose-free. Lactose is a sugar found only in dairy milk.

**Do lactose-free coffee creamers taste the same as dairy creamers?**
The taste and texture can vary depending on the base ingredient. Some plant-based creamers, like oat milk creamers, are known for their remarkably similar creamy texture and neutral flavor compared to dairy creamers. Others, like coconut milk creamers, may have a distinct coconut flavor.

**How can I store lactose-free coffee creamers?**
Shelf-stable lactose-free creamers can be stored at room temperature until opened. Refrigerated lactose-free creamers should be kept in the refrigerator at all times. Once opened, both types should be refrigerated and consumed within 7-10 days, or as indicated on the packaging.

**Are lactose-free coffee creamers suitable for people with nut allergies?**
If you have a nut allergy, carefully check the ingredient list of any lactose-free coffee creamer before consuming it. Avoid almond milk creamers and any creamers that contain nut extracts or oils. There are many nut-free options available, such as oat milk, soy milk, and coconut milk creamers.

He lives in Germany, and I’m currently visiting him. Mother’s day in Germany is coming up (this sunday). There have been a lot of fights since his mom started acting weird and rude towards me circa 1 year into our relationship. Often he would not believe me when I told him she looked at me with a angry look, or said a indirect nasty comment towards me.

Luckily we have these few months really worked through it. A huge part of the problem was that I felt like he didn’t understand me and my feelings whenever his mom were rude to me, and he would struggle to stand up against her if something was said or done by her against me. If there ever was something serious, he would always let her know. Now he says to me that he sees some of her behaviour, and he now always supports me etc. 

Anyways, long story short - me and her do NOT have a good relationship. Right now, it’s managable to meet her for a few hours when I’m here, a day here and a day there. She always comes with some weird comments towards me, but I have learned to answer a bit back with the same coin, or not acknowledge it and let my boyfriend handle her. 

So: do I wish her a happy mothers day? I feel like if she were actually sweet towards me and genuinely liked me, I would wish her a happy mothers day. But at this point, I do not feel like I care to say this to her. She has two children (her son - my partner, and her daughter - my «SIL»). 

We are going to his sisters wedding the day before mothers day, and I bet his sister is not going to spend time with their mom the day after her wedding. I’m thinking maybe his mom expects him/us to come over, but I truly do not feel like it. If anything, he can go alone, or we can meet her for a cup of coffee.

Am I completely wrong in this case? Will I make my case with his mom even worse? At this point he knows I am not very positive towards her and it seems like he is not upset about this, as we joke about her or we barely see her anymore when I’m in Germany.

Just a study spot? I have a few things that I would like to include in a university library because I have realized no one actually goes to the university library to check out books.

1. Better ventilation for air circulation because most of the areas have little to no areas of cool air, it is way too hot here in Texas
2. Since most college students are tired, maybe a napping pod area like what UC Santa Barbara should have? You can find reference pictures on google.
3. An integrated school coffee shop with food right outside the main gates? When I went to UCSD, I realized that there was a student worked coffee shop so that you wouldn't have to give up your study spot when you got hungry.
4. Examination centers? There is an exam center that most STEM exam takers have to go to and it's like really far. For reference, this library has a lot of room, around 7 floors worth of space.
5. More fiction books? Maybe more books and magazines from outside the country? Free or discounted magazine purchase as a student? Basically no one here actually wants to check out nor purchase from the library and a lot of college students love reading manga. I was thinking about (if possible) translated Shounen Sunday magazines for the students to pay at a discounted rate. It would increase the funding for the school.
6. More modes of mediums to study with? I think with the slow death of chalkboards, I feel really upset by the fact that whiteboards are being put as the only physical educational display here in most classrooms and study rooms. For mathematics and such, I believe the implementation of chalkboards alongside whiteboards would motivate students. I may be wrong on this though.
7. More upper level outdoor areas to study with? I think with the inclusion of balconies, it would introduce a diversity of study options and hopefully with enough shade.

I hope this was a thorough enough list for possible university library renovations. A part of me really wishes that the library wasn't just a place to insult in my school, but a better place for every student.",1,1746649250.0,Libraries,0,0.67,False

We have a really decent food bank in town that even grows some of their own produce during the growing season. It's pretty hit and miss some days you may get 3 carts full of food for one person some days half of one cart. You can only go once a month. 

It's a decent mix. A lot of restaurants donate so sometimes you will get an unusually large amount of one thing. For example 10 lbs of onions or 8 (literally) gallons of flavored coffee creamer.  

This time around I've noticed a shift in what all is in there. But I am not complaining. The food bank here tends to get very thoughtful with what they give when they have to give less. Smaller haul usually means an extra portion of frozen meat and pantry stuff that is directly usable. Today I got my 30$ Uber fares worth. 

 I don't go every month. I don't drive and it's expensive to Uber and risk not getting a good haul. 

I wanted to go one last time before the tariff stuff really started hurting the economy. Has anyone else noticed a change in their local food pantry? I've heard rumors but I want to ask actual people.

1kh7g4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kh7g4f/found_out_my_boyfriend_has_had_a_relationship/,Found out my boyfriend has had a relationship with his au pair host and I feel like I’m going insane. What do I do?,"Long-ass text but it kind of needs the context. Also throwaway account because this is too fucked up.

My boyfriend 23M, who’s from another country, and I 21F met a few months ago, and everything has been going great. So great, in fact, that I’ve started to trust him completely, and we’ve even started planning our future together.

The first time he came to my country was for a vacation about a year and a half ago. That’s when he met the family he later became an au pair for, just a regular family: husband, wife, and kids. He was doing some kind of job for them painting their house. He fell in love with the country and wanted to move here. They all got along well and decided he would come back to take care of the kids, which would also give him a reason to get a visa (since the job market here is pretty bad right now).

After his vacation, he had to go back to his home country to wait for his visa, which took a few months. He returned last fall and has been working for the family as an au pair ever since. They’ve had some issues, mainly the mom, who is bipolar and sometimes lashes out at him over the smallest things, so I was a bit skeptical at first. But I met the family and they seemed really nice, especially the mom. She immediately took me in, was incredibly kind, and genuinely seemed like she wanted us to become friends.

Anyway, a few nights ago, my boyfriend was at my place and while he was in the shower, I did the most stupid thing: I went through his phone. I felt so ashamed, but I’ve been cheated on before and only found out years later. I wasn’t expecting to find anything, but I thought it was better to be safe.

That’s when I found a deleted screenshot. It was a conversation between him and the mom, and it seemed like they’d been fighting. He had written that he loved her, apologized for something, and it read like a love letter. She rejected him in the messages.

At first, I couldn’t believe it. My whole reality shattered. I went mute for an hour in complete shock, and my boyfriend was freaking out, trying to understand what was happening. Then I asked him, “Is there something between you and the mom that you haven’t told me?” He repeatedly said no. I was still so shocked and didn’t want to believe what I had seen, so I started to repress it and even believed him for a moment. Then I pulled out his phone, my heart sank again, and that’s when he finally told me the truth.

He and the mom had started a relationship the first time he came here, without the husband knowing, of course. They continued it long-distance while he was waiting for his visa, but broke it off about a month after he came back to work for them. So this had gone on for about a year. They apparently decided to pretend like it had never happened and to keep it a secret forever.

It’s not even the affair itself that hurts the most. It’s the fact that this woman welcomed me into her home, invited me for coffee, tried to build a friendship with me, and encouraged me to open up while knowing full well that she and my boyfriend had been in a relationship. And no one was ever going to tell me. It wasn’t even that long ago. She even said that if we ever had kids, she’d love to babysit. The worst part is, if I hadn’t found that screenshot, my boyfriend would’ve just let it all continue as if nothing had happened. Maybe she and I would have become lifelong friends. The thought makes me sick.

And her poor husband. He was cheated on for so long, and the man who did it has been living in his house, taking care of his kids for months.

I’m still in shock. I have no idea what to do. I feel like my trust is completely shattered.

I told my boyfriend I need to talk to her, but he begged me not to. If she finds out I know, he’s likely to lose his job and get deported. I can’t tell the husband either, because it would destroy their family, my boyfriend would be known as a homewrecker, and the kids would need therapy.

TL;DR:
Started dating a great guy from another country. Things were serious and we were planning a future. I found out by snooping on his phone that he’d had a year-long affair with the mom in the host family he works for. She had also tried to befriend me. He only admitted it after I confronted him. Now I’m heartbroken, can’t trust him, and can’t tell anyone without destroying lives. No idea what to do.

My heart feels shattered, my mind is still racing. Should I leave him over this?",1,1746649132.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1kh7fen,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibiza/comments/1kh7fen/club_advice_for_first_timers_from_somebody_who/,Club advice for first timers - from somebody who lives on the island and works in the industry for more than 20 years.,"Let me start by saying:
I am making this post for the good of the community. Nobody is an expert on Ibiza. Certainly not me. There are no definitive rules. 

The absolute best way to experience the island is to go with the flow. See where your journey takes you. Be open to new experiences, new music, new people, new food. For every person that comes here, the experience should be unique. Find what works for you. If you are open, the island will embrace you and you *will* experience the magic. If you do not, the island might chew you up and spit you out. I've seen it happen to many, so be warned.

My first and number one tip is. **Put your goddamn phone away.** You can post a million tiktoks when you're getting all dressed up with your crew, show off your fashion (please be outrageous, the more self expressive you are, the better), the lit place you're staying in, tell everyone you're in Ibiza and on your way to you're favorite DJ so they'll envy you, even on your way to the party. But once you are inside, keep it in your pocket. The only reasonable exception is to pull it out to take a quick snap of you and your crew in the middle of a heaving dancefloor just for the memory that you were there. Also selfies with randoms that you struck a conversation with outside the toilets are acceptable. Reasons being:

Firstly, respect other people there. They might not want to be filmed and for sure they do not want your flash in their face fucking up the amazing visuals.

Secondly, nobody is going to watch your shakey video with shit sound anyway.

Thirdly, you look like an idiot waving your phone around, posing as if you are the star of the show. Seriously, nobody else cares.

Just put your phone away.

Ok, first rant over, lets move on. You've got that into your head... right?

Next, let's talk about the venues. Which ones are for you? Following is the opinion of a forty something guy who designs nightclubs for a living, on the island and all over the world, and has experienced it all, so take that as you will. (Ps. Please don't send me DM's, I won't answer them.)

In order of amazingness, give or take (up for discussion). Edit: There are many more great smaller venues on the island not mentioned here. But I will not give up the real hidden gems. They will come to you if you arrive here with an open mind and heart and ready for adventure.

**1 Pacha**

Pacha is just the epitome of the magic of Ibiza. Steeped with history, the sweat of a million gurning clubbers ingrained into the stone walls. It was an old finca that has evolved into what it is today from very basic and rustic bones. Endless corners and steps, white paint (how do they keep it white?), exposed stone, mixed with considered and intelligently designed high tech elements. As a first timer, you thought you saw the whole club, but then you discover a new bit when you were just trying to find the toilets. And the Pacha crowd is just super cool, as are the staff. The sound in the main room is big and pumping and the visuals are artistic and complimentary. The guys up on the light control are some of the best in the business.

**2 DC10**

Started as literally an aircraft hanger. Straight up, DC10 has the best line ups and the best music. They are always at the front of what's new as well as the long time main stay headliners are just wicked. They have a super minimal approach to visuals, but what is there is clever and somehow just enough. The sound is loud, but honestly (sadly) not amazing. For me personally it does not do justice to the quality of the music. So if you're looking for audiovisual spectacular, DC10 isn't for you. But if you just care about the tunes, then it cannot be beaten. In recent years the club has been ridiculously oversold and overcrowded, but the rough and tumble of the place is kinda part of its charm. Don't piss off the security here. You'll be out. Let's see when UNVRS opens, if it's still so packed. Hopefully not.

**3 Cova Santa**

Literally built around a cave on the side of a mountain. Kinda hippy vibe, but not really. More like a bunch of office workers who bought a kimono on Shein and want to masquerade as hippies for the night. Sounds harsh, but honestly that vibe is quite cool. Everybody is playing the part and up for it. Woomoon and Storytellers? Incredible music. Highly recommended. The outside is like a hippy market with a DJ stage on the high side of the mountain, with VIP tables going up the mountain. Honestly, they have probably the coolest and least cringey VIP on the island. Performers and shows, it's great! Then you go into the club later, and if you're lucky you get to experience the cave.

**4 Chinois**

New on the block, took over Heart in 2024, this venue has come out hitting hard. Very solid line ups, very cool venue, the crowd might be a little high strung imho.

**5 Amnesia**

Imagine a basketball stadium with amazing DJ's in it. The rooms are cavernous, the sound isn't great, the bars are slow... but the music is usually amazing. For me personally, I remember hearing Sven Vath on the terrace make the crowd go insane because he dropped a hihat after 3 minutes of kick drum. I mean, really. Respect. And those C02 cannons. And Marco. Yeah, I can't diss this place too hard, even though it really could be better. Going to the toilets feels like navigating a favela. 13 euros for a warm, shitty beer. But. It's still cool. You should go and experience it and tell me I'm wrong.

**6 Hi**

""Number 1 nightclub in the world"" Maybe? Depends what you're into. For me, it's super 'Dubai Style'. VIP is king. Big bottles, celebrities (which you plebs will be far away from) massive artists, more botox and filler than an episode of the Kardashians, Hi has it all. Audiovisual spectacular? Absolutely. It's just fucking amazing, up until now, there is no bigger spectacle (keep your fucking phone in your pocket, it's already on YouTube if you want to see it again ffs). But it's recently also been massively overcrowded. Again, lets see how that dynamic changes once UNVRS opens? I'm still jaded that Space had to go to make way for it. Space was much more grounded. More about the actual music. Hi is about bigger, better, more money, wow. A lot of people love it. It's the number one club in the world. Go check it out, you're only in Ibiza once right?


**7 Ushuaia**

It's a giant pool party inside a hotel. It's very instagrammable (I told you to keep your phone in your pocket). The visuals are... cool? I mean everybody at this point has seen a festival stage. It's a festival around a pool nobody can swim in. Full of influencers. If you want to see an artist who plays there, by all means, go for it. Just be prepared to pay 25 euro for a vodka redbull for the privilege.

**8 Akasha**

Back to the hippy vibe (of course), they claim to have the best sound in the world. It's good, but it aint that. The whole location is a must visit on any trip to ibiza. Try to go there on a night with a solid lineup, see the hippy market, then go into the club. That's the way to do it.

Bonus: Beach Clubs

**O Beach**

Again, super Dubai style. It's all about glitz and glamour. It's a pool party on another level. It's all about VIP, bottles, celebrities... wait, it's basically Hi crowd but a day party around a pool... with not as good DJ's. But it's the best San An has to offer, so if you're there, then why not check it out.

**Blue Marlin**

Honestly, the most misunderstood venue out of all of them that I've mentioned. Super mixed crowd, from families to billionaires to locals, all mixing it up. Amazing location surrounded by nature. It's actually a beach club. Meaning it is a beach and a proper club. As in dancefloor, sound system, good DJ's - club. The place often has unannounced sets, I've seen everything from Black Coffee to Marco Carolla to David Guetta and Fatboy Slim. You just have to be lucky. Also one of the few places on the island with free entry, you can just walk in and buy a beer at the bar for 8 euros and see Marco play, close up.

Extra bonus - Villa Parties

If you have to buy a ticket to a villa party, it's a shit villa party. The ones you see on insta and tiktok? You just need to be lucky. Remember the random you took a selfie with outside the toilets whilst everthing kicked in hard? They're the people you get an invite to a good villa party from. Talk to people. Make friends. Be friendly. Be open. As I said, then the island will embrace you.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk, hope it was helpful.

Also to you Americans: EDM is not a thing here, please do some research into the real genres of electronic music.

1kh7efu,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1kh7efu/tw_pet_loss_my_cat_died_in_my_arms_yesterday_and/,TW: Pet Loss My cat died in my arms yesterday and my mom told me to get over it,"For context, my mom had cancer and had a lot of surgeries done so I’ve basically had to give up my future plans for example:  college, getting a job with health insurance, having a social life. I’ve become the unpaid maid of the house and my mom’s full time caretaker. This has already been a lot and has been extremely draining emotionally and physically especially because my mom is a narcissist, and I believe likes the control and having me wait over her. 
While dealing with all this I noticed that my cat was really jaundiced like 3 weeks ago, so I took him to the vet. He was given fluids, meds, all kinds of shots, and seemed to be making an improvement for about a week. But it all went down hill from there, he stopped eating and drinking water, stopped grooming himself, and was losing weight rapidly. The vet told me he most likely was experiencing liver failure we never got an actual answer. I suspect he might have had liver disease because it’s common in siamese cats which is what he was. 

I love this cat so much and always have, I got him when he was three years old from a kill shelter. I had him for five years he even moved with me back home when I had to come back to take care of my mother. 
Yesterday was so incredibly hard for me, I knew he probably wasn’t going to make it much longer because he couldn’t keep his head up. So I just laid with him, we listened to fleetwood mac and I held him and sang to him and told him everything would be okay. My mom was there with me but did end up leaving me alone while he was dying to have a smoke break. 

He had the death rattle before he passed and it was violent and I just can’t get the look he had on his face out of my mind as I literally watched the life leave his eyes. I held him and told him how good he was and how much I loved him and he was gone. We ended up burying him in the backyard by these trees he used to hang out near whenever he escape my apartment. It was honestly one of the worst days of my life. I already have PTSD so my brain just keeps replaying him dying and what he looked like on a loop. 

Every morning I make my mom her coffee make sure she takes her meds and then do her wound change, I came up to do that today and noticed the family dog had an accident on the bed next to her, I was in the middle of taking the sheets of the bed when she decides to play Landslide by fleetwood mac on the tv, knowing that’s what I listened to as my cat was dying, she was there when it happened. I immediately start sobbing and she starts raising her voice at me and telling me i’m being ridiculous and dramatic, and to just get over it. This is when I drop what i’m doing and walkout and say I’m done helping her for today. She starts yelling at me and tells me to stay in my room for the rest of the day and that she doesn’t want to see me. It’s really hard to be in my room without my cat i’m just so used to having him here hearing him meow and walk around and it’s just so hard to not have that anymore. 

I only had him for 5 years and should’ve had so much more time with him. 
My mom has been super unhelpful throughout the whole thing and even told me just to let him die instead of taking him to the vet, when I first noticed how sick he was getting. I think maybe she didn’t like all the attention not being on her anymore.  I just can’t imagine being there with someone while they hold their cat in their arms as he’s dying and then telling them to get over it the next day. He hasn’t even been in the ground a whole day yet. ",1,1746649017.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1) I have never been invited to any special event at an AD

2) Have any of you?

3) WTF?! I’m freaking out. Am I gonna be offered a new release? Am I gonna get to try on a new release that isn’t available, but heck, since I’m there at this special event they’re gonna pull out a panda with my name on it?

4) am I just gonna be offered coffee and a special catalogue and get to watch a slideshow, and then be sent home empty handed and in shame 🔔?

First I did enemas to clear the impaction. I learned this from others here who point out the dangers of eating fiber if you are impacted since you can just get more backed up. I had to do 3 enemas over around 10 days due to no natural bm. 

Then I ramped up the fiber. 

This is what I’m eating:

Breakfast : oats and chai seed in almond milk soaked overnight, added 6 prunes and half a banana. 

Mid morning: apple 

Lunch: homemade batch-cooked veggie soup with all the fiber like sweet potatoes, cauliflower, spinach etc

Mid afternoon: apple 

Dinner: a protein with 2 veggie sides

2 liters water thru the day

Abdominal massage twice daily plus whenever I thought about it - I just watched one on YouTube and did what they said.

It’s going well so far 🤷‍♀️
