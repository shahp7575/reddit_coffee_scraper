* The Role of Cognitive Function in Daily Life

Think about your typical day. You need to remember appointments, focus on work or school tasks, make decisions, and learn new things. All of these activities rely on your brain functioning well. When your mind is sharp, you can handle these tasks more easily and feel more confident.

* Forget names or dates more often

# Benefits of Using CogniCare Pro

CogniCare Pro is designed to offer several potential benefits for cognitive health and function:

* **Enhanced Memory and Focus**

One of the main goals of CogniCare Pro is to support memory function. The supplement aims to help you recall information more easily, whether it's remembering where you put your keys or recalling important details for work or study. It's also formulated to potentially improve focus, helping you stay on task and concentrate for longer periods.

* **Improved Mental Clarity and Alertness**

CogniCare Pro is intended to promote mental clarity, potentially reducing that foggy feeling some people experience. The combination of ingredients is meant to support overall cognitive function, which could lead to feeling more alert and mentally sharp throughout the day.

* **Support for Long-Term Cognitive Health**

* **Stress Reduction and Mood Support**

* **Antioxidant Support**

Several ingredients in CogniCare Pro have antioxidant properties. These compounds may help protect brain cells from oxidative stress, which is thought to play a role in cognitive decline.

* **Natural Energy Support**

While some other cognitive enhancers work on the principle of stimulants for energy, CogniCare Pro seems to be designed a bit differently and naturally. This could result in long-term mental energy without the ‚Äòcrashes‚Äô that are common with other caffeine-laden supplements.¬†

* **Enhanced Memory and Focus**

One of the main goals of CogniCare Pro is to support memory function. The supplement aims to help you recall information more easily, whether it's remembering where you put your keys or recalling important details for work or study. It's also formulated to potentially improve focus, helping you stay on task and concentrate for longer periods.

* **Improved Mental Clarity and Alertness**

**Understanding Cognitive Health**

Cognitive health is about how well your brain works. This includes things like remembering information, paying attention, learning new skills, and solving problems. When your cognitive health is good, everyday tasks become easier.

* The Role of Cognitive Function in Daily Life

Think about your typical day. You need to remember appointments, focus on work or school tasks, make decisions, and learn new things. All of these activities rely on your brain functioning well. When your mind is sharp, you can handle these tasks more easily and feel more confident.

* Common Cognitive Health Challenges

As we get older or when we're stressed, we might notice some changes in how our brains work. Maybe you:

* Forget names or dates more often
* Have trouble concentrating on tasks
* Feel like your thinking is slower than usual
* Struggle to multitask like you used to

# Benefits of Using CogniCare Pro

CogniCare Pro is designed to offer several potential benefits for cognitive health and function:

* **Enhanced Memory and Focus**

One of the main goals of CogniCare Pro is to support memory function. The supplement aims to help you recall information more easily, whether it's remembering where you put your keys or recalling important details for work or study. It's also formulated to potentially improve focus, helping you stay on task and concentrate for longer periods.

* **Improved Mental Clarity and Alertness**

CogniCare Pro is intended to promote mental clarity, potentially reducing that foggy feeling some people experience. The combination of ingredients is meant to support overall cognitive function, which could lead to feeling more alert and mentally sharp throughout the day.

* **Support for Long-Term Cognitive Health**

While many users might be looking for immediate effects, CogniCare Pro is also designed with long-term brain health in mind. Regular use of the supplement aims to provide ongoing support for cognitive function, potentially helping to maintain mental acuity as you age.

* **Stress Reduction and Mood Support**

Some ingredients in CogniCare Pro, such as Bacopa Monnieri and Rhodiola Root, are believed to have stress-reducing properties. By potentially lowering stress levels, the supplement may indirectly support better cognitive function and overall well-being.

* **Antioxidant Support**

Several ingredients in CogniCare Pro have antioxidant properties. These compounds may help protect brain cells from oxidative stress, which is thought to play a role in cognitive decline.

* **Natural Energy Support**

While some other cognitive enhancers work on the principle of stimulants for energy, CogniCare Pro seems to be designed a bit differently and naturally. This could result in long-term mental energy without the ‚Äòcrashes‚Äô that are common with other caffeine-laden supplements.¬†

Cognitive health is about how well your brain works. This includes things like remembering information, paying attention, learning new skills, and solving problems. When your cognitive health is good, everyday tasks become easier.

* The Role of Cognitive Function in Daily Life

Think about your typical day. You need to remember appointments, focus on work or school tasks, make decisions, and learn new things. All of these activities rely on your brain functioning well. When your mind is sharp, you can handle these tasks more easily and feel more confident.

* Common Cognitive Health Challenges

As we get older or when we're stressed, we might notice some changes in how our brains work. Maybe you:

* Forget names or dates more often
* Have trouble concentrating on tasks
* Feel like your thinking is slower than usual

CogniCare Pro is designed to offer several potential benefits for cognitive health and function:

* **Enhanced Memory and Focus**

One of the main goals of CogniCare Pro is to support memory function. The supplement aims to help you recall information more easily, whether it's remembering where you put your keys or recalling important details for work or study. It's also formulated to potentially improve focus, helping you stay on task and concentrate for longer periods.

* **Improved Mental Clarity and Alertness**

* **Support for Long-Term Cognitive Health**

While many users might be looking for immediate effects, CogniCare Pro is also designed with long-term brain health in mind. Regular use of the supplement aims to provide ongoing support for cognitive function, potentially helping to maintain mental acuity as you age.

* **Stress Reduction and Mood Support**

Some ingredients in CogniCare Pro, such as Bacopa Monnieri and Rhodiola Root, are believed to have stress-reducing properties. By potentially lowering stress levels, the supplement may indirectly support better cognitive function and overall well-being.

* **Natural Energy Support**

I‚Äôm convinced that this is a case of reverse causality. It starts with a spark of bigotry, which is then voluntarily kindled into a fire with misinformation, conspiracy, and a narrow self serving media diet. It‚Äôs a choice. 

I heard a Christian theologian on Alex O‚ÄôConnor talk about this today and it made me think. He basically said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt accidentally become a flat Earther. The prideful idea of being a rebel, or vanguard who sees the truth when everyone can‚Äôt ect, speaks to you. You are attracted to this narrative so you send yourself down the rabbit hole. We‚Äôre not passive actors in this.‚Äù I‚Äôm paraphrasing. 

An obvious example is the Haitians eating cats. Did they dislike Haitians because they think they eat cats? No, they choose to believe this nonsense because they already don‚Äôt like them. 

I remember destiny talking about cheating in a similar way. Maybe you don‚Äôt ‚Äúchoose‚Äù to fall in love with a co worker, but it starts with the choice to kindle that relationship. Flirt, get a casual coffee after work, ect. 

It‚Äôs not even a stretch to call these people evil. If Trump wanted to legit execute political opponents, I‚Äôm convinced that 70-80% would go along with it. ",4,1728439536.0,Destiny,0,0.83,False

1fzgst2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1fzgst2/my_dads_whore_wife_is_ruining_my_relationship/,my dads whore wife is ruining my relationship with him ,"Off the bat I apologize for how long this is. 
My(f25) dad (m 59) is an alcoholic, has been one for years and never properly addressed the issue until recently. For context, I do not get along with his wife(a lot of history there that would take pages upon pages to type) at all but for the sake of his sobriety and my sanity I have tried to just say nothing about her/ complain. They had a non refundable booze cruise planned months before we had officially addressed his drinking issues and his wife decided to go on the cruise with him although he had only been sober for maybe a month and he relapsed and then I  involved his family( my dads sister, brothers, mom and my cousins). My dad has a lot of pride and this has been very hard for him but everyone has been supportive except for, in my opinion,  his wife. 

We did a 3 way call at some point after his second relapse and if you knew me you would know just how insane it is that I was on a fucking 3 way call with my dad and his wife with the way my relationship with his wife stands but like I said, I was trying to put my shit to the side because this way about my dad. On the call,  she was just furious and threatening to leave him and that he's going to die before he's 60 (mind you she was also the one that drank with him on the cruise when he was freshly sober.) I hate that she's the one with him all the time because she's doing a horrible job. ( my brother and I don‚Äôt live with my dad anymore) She just makes him feel bad. The fight that happened a few days ago involved him calling me about a normal thing and then went off the rails fast. I also could tell he was in a horrid mood off the bat. He  starts talking about randomly drinking wine every once in a while and I tried to explain very calmly that I did not think that was a good idea or something he should even be thinking about right now because it's not important. He has said the drinking wine thing multiple times in the last 2 months when he's only been sober for maybe 6 months but i'm not even confident he's sober because he slips up so much (we have caught him drinking beer instead of ‚Äúsparkling water‚Äù) but anyways it's concerning and I feel his bitch wife is trying to get him to drink. ( I remember her berating him about how they used to be able to drink together so what happened so she's mad he's sober but mad also when he starts drinking again.) 

He immediately got defensive and aggressive and then I asked who he's talked to this about and asking if he's spoke to his therapist and he says no and that he's talked to me and his wife and I must have made a noise but I did not say much other than something around the lines of we are both not who you should consult on this and also like no drinking at all if you're an alcoholic and I had also NEVER confronted him about his wife‚Äôs  foolishness with letting him on the cruise or anything else she's done recently because im trying to not stress him out but he starts getting aggressive saying don't start going on about my wife, she's the one that's been supporting me and she started all this like no she didn't and no she isn't but I didn‚Äôt actually say any of that, I said ‚Äúwell seeing as she's the one who took you on the booze cruise and drank with you while you were freshly sober i'm not sure how much I trust her judgement‚Äù and he did not like that remark and just starts being all defensive about his wife and how the ticket was non refundable and now claiming it‚Äôs not a booze cruise but that he bought the drinking tickets so they could drink coffee??? and asking me if he should have just cancelled the trip and not received a refund and I said are you fucking kidding me of course when your health is at risk (my dad is 59 with high blood pressure and years of alcohol abuse but overall okay but still don't think alcohol is ever a good option for him anymore nor will it help any of his preexisting conditions.) 

He just starts getting mad saying that's ridiculous and that his health is fine and that he realized (emphasis on him because no therapist or doctor has made this conclusion) he doesn't have a chemical addiction but rather he went thru things"" and used it to cope and kept saying how I was saying he's not capable or that he's going to fall off the wagon and that was making him super upset but I never said any of that and have only ever been supportive like I have never got angry with him  through this entire situation and told him he was projecting. The one who was actually a non supportive bitch was his wife. He kept saying because he was an alcoholic for this last year that he is fine but he's been one for YEARS he's just in denial. It's catching up with him now that he's older but he's always had a problem. I mentioned the times he drove my brother and I drunk on multiple occasions (sometimes I had to take over the driving) or just when he would lie and say he was at the gym growing up and we could smell it on his breathe.

He got defensive again and just yelled that he didn't want to talk about this anymore. At this point I was very upset because I did not expect to get in a fight with my dad especially after holding my tongue on things to do with his horrible wife in order to to keep the peace so I was blind sided and really confused as to why he was being so mean to me and aggressive so l ended the call crying saying i didn't understand why he was treating me this way but that I could not handle it. 

My dad usually looses his temper but calms down quick. I had texted him because I didn‚Äôt want to talk on the phone anymore(i‚Äôll just upload the screenshots if I can of text messages). My mom, my bf and my brother are furious and tell me not to talk to him. Brother says he will handle the communication from here on out. Fast forward to the next day I genuinely thought he would have calmed down and felt bad for being so fucking mean but I was very mistaken. 

We were actually supposed to see my dad (my brother and I) for dinner that next night and due to all the fighting the day before, I told my brother I was unsure if I wanted to go and he understood but then I thought it might be good to have a conversation about this all in person. My dad is not answering our group chat so I decide to call him(my brother offered but I said I could because I genuinely didn‚Äôt think it would go so bad)

My dad is cold and curt off the bat. He asks what‚Äôs up and I just say I‚Äôm checking in to see if he still wants to meet up later. He says sure with like zero enthusiasm so atp i‚Äôm like okay well if you don‚Äôt want to see me right now then that‚Äôs fine we can do it another day. He says well you know i‚Äôm actually really not happy with the way you talked about my wife. I genuinely don‚Äôt understand wtf I said that was so offensive but i‚Äôm certain it‚Äôs just because her devil ass is in his ear. I told him I once again stood by the fact that I criticized her decision to go on a booze cruise with you and also for the way she‚Äôs been handling/speaking to you on multiple occasions about your addiction. To spare more word vomit we just start fighting like he is furious with me for ‚Äútalking about his wife that way‚Äù and telling me to be a ‚Äúfucking adult‚Äù and I got so fucking triggered. To explain why I got triggered in detail abt this situation would take idek how long but my history with my dad and his wife is very rocky/ problematic and has been for years and I was seriously trying so hard to not say a fucking word about anything this entire year, even when something upset me because I didn‚Äôt want him to get stressed and relapse so him blaming me for causing this fight and just screaming at me made me incredibly upset. I am unfortunately very ruled by my emotions in arguments so I ended up just sobbing and screaming at him which I know is not productive. This conversation now was like fully about how I don‚Äôt get along with his wife and he‚Äôs screaming at me about how my brother and I have not accepted her and how we need to respect her and ‚Äúget over it‚Äù. (very short explanation for my history with his wife is that one of her sons was best friends with my brother in grade school and in turn she became best friends with my mom who was still married to my dad at the time. They ended up having an affair and he‚Äôs now married to her and left my mom. There is so much more filler as to just how fucking rotten of a person she is but that‚Äôs all I can type rn beacuse this is already so long)told him how he has no idea the position he‚Äôs put me in with this wife and how my brother and I will have to deal with her for the rest of our lives if we want to have a relationship with our dad. I told him it‚Äôs unfair to ask me to push past a healthy boundary i‚Äôve put in place for myself with his wife and that i‚Äôve already gone way past my comfort zone multiple times to appease him only for him to still be mad. At that point we were really going at it like I probably looked insane to the other people on the freeway fucking screaming into the receiver and ugly crying. 

Anyways that‚Äôs when he drops the worst possible sentence. In response to me telling him that he has no idea how shitty the position he put my brother and I in for life he goes ‚Äúwhy do you think I drink xmynamex? because of all the fucking guilt you have put on me all these years.‚Äù and that‚Äôs when I actually was done. He has told me on multiple occasions I ‚Äúsaved‚Äù his life. I was the one that involved are extended family because his wife told me not to and under her care only he relapsed like 5 times (don‚Äôt even really believe he‚Äôs sober rn) (and also not fully blaming her for his relapse only blaming her not not letting anyone else know for so long) and she also verbally berated him otp with me, who knows what she says to him in person. I can say that I can understand being frustrated while living with someone that has an addiction and how that will make you say mean stuff  but that‚Äôs about the only grace I will give her. She was upset that are most recent family trip was a dry weekend in support of my dad. She‚Äôs done countless other things that I can‚Äôt even began to explain how frustrating it is that he credits her with ‚Äústarting this whole thing‚Äù and by starting it she texted me on two separate occasions and we NEVER TEXT like those maybe have been the only texts we have ever sent to eachother but she texted to let me know he was driving drunk /sneaking alcohol and that she couldn‚Äôt deal with it and then I HAD TO GET THE ball rolling while trying to explain to a grown woman how alcoholism can make you lie because she was furious with my dad for lying and rapid fire texting me about that while i‚Äôm asking her if he‚Äôs currently drunk driving because if so let‚Äôs stop that first omg. I‚Äôm sorry if I explained this bad but now I basically I don‚Äôt know  how to talk to my dad. I have not spoken to him since like after he said that I told him I didn‚Äôt want to talk to him , I didn‚Äôt know when I would and I didn‚Äôt want to see him and hung up because I was too upset to even think of anything better to say. My bf now like hates my dad, my family ,friends everyone is telling me to not talk to him for a while. I just have no idea what to do. We used to fight a lot like this when I was a teenager and actually had more self confidence then and more savageness because I would straight up ban her from coming to anything I would be at/refused to talk to her or do anything.

Illegal snuff films, untraceable, used for cheating, but I also hear others use it like everyday texting too like WhatsApp.  I told him I don't have it and said its a little shady to move from texting to that if we already have each others numbers, and its not like we were sending photos. 

His reply? ""Privacy is healthy and appropriate.""

Anyone else think this is weird or am I projecting? I was cheated on and he used KiK and Snapchat because of those features and access to cam girls. 
It kind of gave me vibes that he's either got someone at home he's hiding this from, or he wanted to get real dirty (which I'm not interested in after 1 date) and that he'll use 'privacy' as the reason to use apps like that.

1fzgrvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFWr4rIndia/comments/1fzgrvx/40_m4f_bangalore_looking_for_someone_to_tag_along/,40 [M4F] Bangalore - Looking for someone to tag along for a small drive on Oct 11th,"Hello. This Friday is a holiday for my office. I am planning to take a small drive as I have absolutely nothing to do. I plan to stop by at a restaurant ~50 km away (details provided below) for a cup of coffee and then drive back home. I don't have any company who could join me and I hate driving alone. I am willing to include just one person to tag along for the whole to and fro journey that could possibly take ~4 to 5 hours depending on traffic conditions. 

If you are someone who would like to tag along, please do drop me a message. I would be happy to pick you up in my car at a location you're comfortable with and would also drop you back safe and sound at a location you prefer. This is going to be purely platonic and I am not looking for anything more than just a conversation and some company during the journey. No personal boundaries will be crossed. I intend to get back home before night time too as I don't want you to feel anxious about staying out with a stranger. Everything will be planned, discussed and finalized only after you have reviewed and approved.

I would however expect you to be comfortable connecting outside of reddit and be prepared to verify well before the journey so that there are no confusions or doubts later on. I also want to be upfront in saying that I am an average looking guy, I live a very simple lifestyle and I don't exactly dress to impress. I don't smoke or drink and I am a pure vegetarian too. 

This is not a date so I don't care much about your appearance, outfit or anything else. I just hope you're much better at starting conversations as I am an introvert by nature and do not usually talk much. I would prefer you to be someone who is 30+ and from Bangalore. Full disclosure, I am married but will be travelling alone on this day.

Few things that are absolutely non-negotiable for me are that there will be strictly no alcohol involved at all and absolutely no smoking inside my car.

Details outlined below:

Date - Oct 11th (Friday)

Time - Preferably after lunch, 2 pm onwards

Travel to - Any simple and popular restaurant on the highway for a cup of coffee/snacks that you have vetted and approved (open to your suggestions too)

Distance - ~50 km one way (1.5 to 2 hours one way, depending on traffic, expect heavy traffic on Friday due to the long weekend)

Travel by: My own car

Approximate travel time: 4 to 5 hours depending on traffic

Please understand that I have never done something like this before. I am a little nervous and also excited at the same time. So kindly forgive me if there's any other detail required for you to be able to join the drive. If there's anything more you would like to know before deciding, I am more than happy to share it with you.

Looking forward to hearing from someone who is willing to take a small drive",1,1728439260.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False
1fzgqre,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1fzgqre/its_tough_being_the_daughter_of_a_superhero/,It's tough being the daughter of a superhero.,"Not many kids can say they have a superhero for a father. 

My Dad was an *amazing* man. He was the coolest person in the *world*. 

Known as our town‚Äôs superhero, he used his newfound powers to bring down evil villains who threatened to take over. 

Nobody knew how he and a number of others acquired their abilities. 

There were rumours of a chemical explosion in the powerplant. 

Some people even believed my Dad was from a different planet, while others were convinced it was natural human evolution. My Dad could shoot lasers out of his eyes, and he was *super* strong. 

When I was seven years old, he single-handedly stopped The Cerebral Drainer, a psychopath with a vacuum like power who took the lives of ten innocent people, sucking out their brains in broad daylight. Dad saved a child live on local TV, swooping down from the sky and telling the panicking crowd *everything is going to be okay*. Then when I was twelve, Dad took down Rat Face, a villain who filled the streets with disease ridden rodents. 

My Dad was our town‚Äôs superhero, and in exchange for keeping his secret from the rest of the world, he protected all of us. 

He was the best superhero (and father) by day, and family-man and loving husband by night. I was Millie Myers, a completely ordinary high school girl, and daughter of *Star-man*. 

It wasn't out of the ordinary for the press to be swarming our door when I got home from school.

Pushing through the crowd of my Dad‚Äôs adoring fans, I flashed my *perfect* smile at the cameras. 

As Star-man‚Äôs daughter, I was yet to reveal my power to the town. 

I could tell they were gunning for it, their wide and frenzied eyes raking me up and down. 

The older I was getting, the less patient the town was. Dad told them in a press conference that I was just a *late bloomer*. Channel 7 news was waiting for me at our front door, immediately sticking a microphone in my face. I was told not to talk to the press. I was tired, and the cameras were hurting my eyes. 

The anchorwoman, Heather Carlisle, was already yelling in my face. 

‚ÄúMillie Myers! Is it true your father is currently interrogating the son of the infamous villain, Six-Eyes?‚Äù

Six Eyes was the opposite of my father. 

Dad strived to protect our town and everyone in it. 

Six Eyes, who was famous for the mutation that came with his ability, sought to destroy it. It was almost a year since he had brainwashed the Mayor and almost taken control of our tiny town. 

Dad did manage to apprehend him, only for Six Eyes to break out of prison two weeks later. 

His eighteen year old son, Cartwright, wanted nothing to do with him. He had even legally changed his name to get as far away from his father as possible.

The boy was only in town for a few weeks, on vacation from college. 

However, over the last few days, my father had reasons to believe Six-Eyes was in contact with his estranged son. 

So, he planned to question the kid on his Dad‚Äôs whereabouts. 

I twisted around, maintaining a wide smile. ‚ÄúNo comment.‚Äù I told the cameras. 

The anchorwoman nodded slowly, thrusting her microphone further into my face. I had to hold back a sneeze. ‚Äú*But* your father is interrogating him *now*, correct? Millie, can you tell us what‚Ä¶ techniques he is using?‚Äù She demanded, her expression riddled with excitement.

She was trying to get me to spill or trip over what I was saying so my words could be taken out of context.

But I was already heavily media trained not to say a thing. I couldn't say the same for when I was a little younger. 

I blindly told the press a *lot* of things I regret. 

Dad didn't get mad easily, but his smile did start to slightly falter when I told Channel 7 our family's business. 

Shutting the press down, I shook my head, making sure to stretch my lips into a big, cheesy grin. Just like my Dad told me. I cleared my throat. 

‚ÄúRest assured, Cartwright is in good hands, I can promise you all that.‚Äù 

I nodded at the crowd, making direct eye contact with each of them. Dad said if I wanted the crowd to believe my earnest words, I had to look into each and every eye, and *mean it*. That's what I did.

‚ÄúAs we all know, the son of Six Eyes is *not* a bad person, and we should not blame him for his father‚Äôs crimes. I cannot speak for my Dad, but I can *assure* you, he *will* find the villain Six Eyes.‚Äù

I held my breath, pausing for just enough time for the crowd to register my words. 

‚ÄúAnd bring him to justice.‚Äù

When I turned to open my door, the spell was broken, more questions thrown at me. 

‚ÄúMillie, is it true you have not inherited your father‚Äôs abilities?‚Äù 

Someone else screamed in my face, and I choked down a yell. 

‚ÄúMillie Myers, can you tell us more about your father‚Äôs interrogation?!‚Äù 

I shrugged. ‚ÄúI don't know. He's just talking to him.‚Äù

‚ÄúMillie!‚Äù A wide eyed redhead followed me, stumbling over my mother‚Äôs rose garden. 

When he carelessly stamped on a blooming rose, I resisted the urge to shove him back. He looked like an ammateur, a college kid, maybe, armed with just his iPhone and a dream. 

The guy got close. 

Too close for comfort, swiping at my jacket. 

His breath was just coffee and cigarettes. ‚ÄúAre you aware of the photos floating around of you and Kai Hendrix, the son of Oculus? Can you confirm that you are in a relationship?‚Äù

A younger woman threw herself in front of him. 

‚ÄúMiss Myers, is there a reason why your brother does not come outside‚Äì‚Äù

Ignoring them, I opened the door, stepped inside our house, and slammed it behind me. Once inside, I let myself breathe, dropping my backpack and pulling off my jacket. There was a folded square of paper tucked into my pocket. 

I pulled it out and ripped it into pieces. There were exactly 1,370 tally marks carved into our front door. With a rusty nail, I scratched another tally, crossing a group of four. *1,371 days.*

Kicking off my shoes, I strode into the downstairs living room. 

‚ÄúI'm home.‚Äù I told my twin brother. 

Ethan Myers was born three minutes after me. We weren't classed as identical twins, but Mom was convinced we were. 

Both of us had thick brown hair, bearing our mother‚Äôs soft features. While I kept mine in a  strict ponytail, Ethan‚Äôs had grown out lighter and curlier than mine, hanging in dark eyes. Ethan was the Myers twin who *was not* in the town‚Äôs spotlight. 

My brother was in his usual place, sitting on the couch, knees pressed to his chest, half lidded eyes glued to the corpse of our TV. The screen had been hollowed out a long time ago.  I skipped into the kitchen and filled a glass of orange juice, took a quick sip, and headed over to my brother, pressing the drink to his lips.

Ethan didn't respond for a moment, before his lazy eyes rolled to me, life erupting into his expression. He gulped it down, juice trickling down his chin. 

When I withdrew the glass, he shot me a grateful smile. I winced when he straightened up, the sound of jingling metal sending me stumbling back. 

‚ÄúThanks, Mills.‚Äù

He held up his right hand, just like when we were little kids. ‚ÄúHigh five?‚Äù 

I ignored his childlike grin, hollowed out eyes penetrating right through me. 

Ethan was never looking at me. He was always looking over my shoulder. But when I followed his gaze, there was nothing there. I ruffled his hair, resisting the urge to wrap my arms around him.  

But I had to keep my distance. 

I stepped back, my gaze trailing the ceiling. ‚ÄúWhere's Dad?‚Äù

Ethan‚Äôs eyes travelled back to the TV, his lips pricking into a smile. 

‚ÄúBasement.‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúDaddy is interrogating the villain‚Äôs son.‚Äù

I nodded, pulling my Switch from my bag and dropping it into his lap. 

It used to be Ethan‚Äôs. In fact, he had carved his initials into the back. ‚ÄúYou can play with this, you know."" I forced out, trying to stop my hands from trembling. 

‚ÄúYou don't have to keep‚Ä¶‚Äù I turned to the shattered TV screen, my heart catapulting into my mouth. Ethan didn't look at me, his gaze boring into the TV. 

He didn't respond, so I headed towards the basement door. 

But not before my brother let out a hysterical giggle. 

When I turned to him, Ethan was seventeen years old, laughing at invisible cartoons. 

‚ÄúDo you expect me to play with no fucking hands?‚Äù 

I didn't, or *couldn't*, reply. 

‚ÄúHey, Millie?‚Äù Ethan hummed, when I pulled open the basement door. 

The chill that followed set my nerve endings on fire. My brother‚Äôs voice was deeper, no longer the childish giggle I'd gotten used to. In the corner of my eye, his head turned towards me. Standing on the threshold for a fraction of a second, I think part of me wondered if Ethan‚Äôs mind had pieced itself back together.

‚ÄúMom wants juice too.‚Äù 

My twin‚Äôs voice was suddenly so small. ‚ÄúCan you get her some?‚Äù

I pretended not to hear him, skipping down to the basement, ignoring how cold each step was, the ingrained red dried into concrete. The *best* part of my day was visiting my father while he was working. I held my breath, easing my way down each step. ‚ÄúHey, Dad?‚Äù I called, easing myself through the dark. 

I always made sure to announce my presence. ‚ÄúDaddy.‚Äù I pulled my lips into the biggest, cheesiest smile. ‚ÄúI'm home.‚Äù

‚ÄúPumpkin!‚Äù Dad‚Äôs voice echoed from the bottom of the stairs. ‚ÄúHow's my favorite girl doing?‚Äù

Moving further down the stairs, I could hear screaming. 

Wailing. 

Sobbing. 

There were specific rules I had to abide by when stepping inside the basement. 

I had to be extra quiet if my father was doing *superhero business*. Over the years, though, Dad had relaxed the rules  a little. When I pushed through the plastic sheeting, Daddy had already opened up the boy‚Äôs head. It's not like I was surprised. He'd moved away from the interrogation stage a long time ago. 

Star-man stood in a simple suit and tie, a white coat draped over. 

My father was young for his age, dark brown hair and pale features. 

Cartwright didn't look so good, lying on his back, his half lidded gaze glued to the ceiling.

I could see sharp red spilled across the floor and the bed he was strapped to.

Star-man loomed over him, cradling the boy‚Äôs jerking head between blood slicked gloves. The closer I got, I could see the exposed meat of the boy‚Äôs brain leaking from the pearly white of his skull. 

Closer. 

Cartwright's body was quaking, his wrists straining against velcro straps. 

My father‚Äôs fingers gently stroked across the pink of his brain, tiny sparks of electricity bleeding from his index. Star-man's grin widened, and I watched the villain‚Äôs son writhing under his touch. 

I could see the tiny sparks of electricity running from Dad‚Äôs fingers, forcing his victim into submission. The villain‚Äôs son‚Äôs eyes rolled back, a wet sounding sob escaping his lips. He was still conscious, and could feel everything. 

Star-man lifted his head, his eyes finding me. 

‚ÄúSweetie! How was school?‚Äù 

He let go of Cartwright's head, delicately changing his gloves for brand new clinical white ones. ‚ÄúYour teacher called about a certain test you have been trying to avoid.‚Äù Dad tutted, swiping his bloody hands on his coat. 

When Cartwright tried to wrench from the bed, he knocked the kid back down with a laugh. ‚ÄúMillie, I *did* say, there will be consequences if you flunk your tests.‚Äù 

He gestured for me to come closer with a blood drenched glove, and I did. 

Star-man prodded a single finger into the raw flesh of Cartwright's brain, and the boy screamed, writhing, blood running thick from his nose. ‚ÄúDo I need to take your phone away, hmm? How about the school trip to New York? Millie, I don't *have* to sign the permission slip.‚Äù He turned back to the villain‚Äôs son, hanging over the boy with a laugh.

‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù He cleared his throat. 

When Dad nodded at me, I laughed too. ‚ÄúYoung Mr Cartwright, the human brain does *not* have nerves, so I don't know why you're screaming. It is quite embarrassing for a boy of your age.‚Äù

He slapped the boy‚Äôs cheek playfully, and Cartwright wailed. 

1,400 days, I thought, watching my father torture the teenage boy.

1,400 days since Star-man walked into our house, burned down our door, and announced himself as our new father. 

I was thirteen years old in middle school. 

Ethan and I were watching TV in the living room, and there he was. 

Star-man, with his signature grin, standing between the melted remnants of our front door.

Stella, our little sister, squeaked in delight. 

‚ÄúStar-man!‚Äù She jumped off of the couch. 

Ethan gently dragged her back, holding her to his chest. 

‚ÄúHey, Mom?‚Äù He yelled, his voice shaking. 

‚ÄúThere's someone at the door.‚Äù

Star-man chuckled, taking a step inside our hallway. 

‚ÄúOh, no, I'm not here for your mother.‚Äù

1,400 days since he murdered our mother, lasering her head cleanly from her shoulders when she threw herself in front of us and begged him to take her. 

There was wet warmth running across the concrete floor. I barely noticed, hopping over it. 

1,400 days since Star-man burned our little sister alive in front of our eyes. 

Star-man didn't *want* three children. 

He wanted two. 

1,400 days since our father nailed wooden planks over the door, announcing Ethan and I as his legacies. 

Ethan started to spiral. He tried to escape out his bedroom window, and then more dangerously, jumping off of the roof of our house, and that just made our father angry. He burned a hole in the TV, and then hollowed out the screen. 

Star-man just wanted a son and a daughter. That's what he told my brother. 

He could not procreate because of the mutation causing his ability. But he had always wanted *children*. 

Star-man promised us he was going to be the best father anyone would ask for. 

And he *was*. 

100 days after murdering our mother and sister, Ethan and I were plunged into the town‚Äôs spotlight. 

*‚ÄúThese are my children!‚Äù* Star-man told a crowd of flashing cameras. 

He wrapped his arms around the two of us, pulling us closer. 

*‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen, I would like you to meet Millie and Ethan Myers from my first marriage.‚Äù

Star-man addressed the crowd with earnest eyes. 

‚ÄúI know what you're thinking, and no, these two are *little rascals*,‚Äù he ruffled our hair a little too hard, and I made sure to laugh and smile and *not* cry. ‚ÄúMillie and Ethan do not share my abilities.‚Äù 

His lips spread into a grin. 

*‚ÄúYet.‚Äù*

That word had been hanging over me since the press-conference. 

*Yet*. 

Presently, Dad was crawling in my head again. 

*Smile, Millie!*. 

I did, smiling so much, blood pooled from my lips. 

Dad promised neither of us would be sad again. We wouldn't fear him or anything else. In fact, we were going to be happy, smiling, perfect children forever, his shining legacies he would dangle in front of the town on our eighteenth birthday. 

It was his birthday present to us, and I was *so* excited.

The closer I was getting to my father, I could sense him fashioning my smile, wider and wider, until I couldn't breathe. 

He didn't care that I was bleeding. 

That my eyes were stinging. 

All he cared about was that I loved him as my father. 

‚ÄúCome here, Millie.‚Äù 

I forced myself forwards, swallowing vomit filling the back of my mouth. 

If I screamed, I would end up like my brother. Ethan was on a permanent time out until his 18th birthday. Star-man was yet to forgive my twin trying to stab him at Thanksgiving dinner. Dad said Ethan‚Äôs mental state was *puberty*, but I was more akin to believing it was a mixture of trauma, as well as our father‚Äôs attempt to poison my brother with powers at fourteen years old which almost killed him. Dad was smart enough to stop the procedure before he killed his only son. 

I blinked, my legs buckling, footsteps faltering. 

Sometimes I think I can pull away from his influence. 

‚ÄúMillie Myers.‚Äù Dad hummed, skimming his finger across a variety of scalpels. Cartwright watched him feverishly. ‚ÄúDon't make me ask again, Pumpkiiiiin.‚Äù

Still.

I felt my thoughts start to melt away, replaced with artificial happiness choking me. Our father was the *best* Dad in the whole world. I wouldn't ask for any other father, and I didn't even miss my mother! 

With that thought slamming into me, I skipped over to my father with a grin. 

Around him were rejects, corpses piled to the ceiling, limbs and heads and torso‚Äôs contorted and merged into one mass of gore. 

Human‚Äôs he attempted to turn into minions. 

But there were also *successful* villains. 

The Cerebral Drainer, and Rat Face had been ripped apart and put back together again. Dad was saving them for a quiet day. The Myers basement was my father‚Äôs workshop. When I joined his side, he ran his fingers over Cartwright's skull. 

I was surprised when the villain‚Äôs son let out a sudden, hysterical giggle, his eyes rolling to pearly whites. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing to him?‚Äù I asked, intrigued, running my hands over the boy‚Äôs restraints. This time, Cartwright's body contorted into an arch, maniacal laughter escaping his lips. 

When his back slammed into metal, the ground rumbled. 

‚ÄúNow, what is funny, hmm?‚Äù Star-man asked in a low hum.

The boy responded by spitting in his face, shrieking with giggles. 

Dad cleared his throat, swiping blood from his cheek. 

‚ÄúThat's not funny.‚Äù

I was keenly aware of several instruments dangling above my head. 

Cartwright's body jolted, and they hit the ground. 

Dad turned his attention to me. ‚ÄúWhat is your nightmare of a brother doing, young lady?‚Äù 

His words shattered part of his influence. 

I felt my breath start to quicken, my heart starting to pound.

*Fear*. 

Ethan hadn't moved in days, weeks, months. 

Glued to that one seat, caught inside his own delusion. 

Ethan was watching TV when Mom‚Äôs brains were splattered across the walls. 

He was watching TV when our little sister‚Äôs flesh bubbled into the living room carpet. 

‚ÄúEthan is watching TV.‚Äù I hummed, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing to the villain‚Äôs son?‚Äù I pointed to the boy‚Äôs contorting fingers. They turned clockwise, straining under harsh velcro straps.

Cartwright was trying to twist off my head like a bottletop. I was lucky to have my father‚Äôs protection. 

Dad shot me a grin. ‚ÄúWell, you see, Millie.‚Äù He said, shoving the hysterical boy back onto the bed. Madness. I saw it in his eyes, igniting every part of his face, running through his nerve endings. 

That is what made a villain, what we all saw on the local news. 

It was the loss of humanity, logic quite literally burned from the brain stem.

Complete, unbridled euphoria, accepting insanity. 

I had already seen this exact look. 

The Cerebral Drainer‚Äôs psychotic grin. 

Rat Face‚Äôs all too familiar and horrific chittering laugh. 

Six Eyes‚Äôs Alice In Wonderland smile. 

Dad rocked the boy‚Äôs head back and forth. Cartwright giggled along, his gaze finding nothing, penetrating nothing. His hands went limp, and he gave up trying to yank my brain from my skull. ‚ÄúWe can't have *heroes* without villains, can we?‚Äù

I reached out, poking the boy in the face.

‚ÄúSo, he's like his father?‚Äù

Dad almost looked like a proud father. ‚ÄúOh, no, honey, he's *better* than his father. He's already setting an example.‚Äù Starman nudged me playfully. ‚ÄúYour father would not exist without the bad guys,‚Äù he said, tracing a finger over the boy‚Äôs cheek. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just lucky we have a town full of naive fuck-wits.‚Äù 

Cartwright laughed *harder*. Hard enough to send him toppling off of the bed with a wet, meaty sounding smack. 

I was partially aware of my body reacting. My breaths quickened, a thick slime creeping up my throat. I think I stepped back. I think I almost screamed.

I forgot his head was hanging open, half of his brains leaking out. 

But I don't think Cartwright *needed* a brain anymore. 

Whatever was left of it was blackened, thick, poisoned streaks running up down what had been healthy pink and grey. 

My Dad scooped him up, and plonked him back onto ice cold steel. 

His evil laugh was fake, manufactured, programmed directly into his mind. 

Part of me wondered if this was his father‚Äôs fate too. 

Six Eyes. 

Was *he* a result of my father‚Äôs experiments?

The crazy thing is, the more I want to scream, my chest heaving, fear starting to gnaw away at me, the stronger my father‚Äôs influence is. The villain‚Äôs son was stitched back up with not even a hair out of place and thrown into the back with the other finished minions.

If he recovered well, Cartwright, son of Six Eyes, would be going on a town rampage very soon. 

Well, he *was* the villain‚Äôs son after all. 

Instead of screaming, I smiled. 

Dad taught me everything about cutting up humans. Human brains were so *easy* to manipulate. 

Because humans were bad. 

The people like my Dad were better. 

I grabbed a scalpel, sticking it into Cartwright's hand. 

His whimper of pain collapsing into hysterical laughter didn't give me hope. 

If he reacted positively to a blade going through his skin, he wasn't worth saving. 

Once that thought crossed my mind, however, I REALLY LOVED MY DAD. 

The mental declaration almost sent me to my knees. 

‚ÄúGo upstairs and do your homework.‚Äù Dad said, wheeling Cartwright into the back room. ‚ÄúI'll be upstairs to cook dinner in ten minutes.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, dad.‚Äù

His influence was like a wire wrapped around my throat.

Squeezing. 

‚ÄúOh, and Millie?‚Äù

I didn't turn around. ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

‚ÄúChocolate or strawberry for your birthday cake?‚Äù

I froze, my smile stretching right across my face. 

He knew my answer. Dad baked us a cake 4 hours after I trashed the slimy remnants of my little sister. Star-man forced me to *peel* my sister from the carpet and dump her in a trash bag.

I could still smell her charred flesh hanging in the air. 

Star-man made a giant chocolate cake and frosting. 

He made us eat every single morsel. 

Every bite was agonising. 

‚ÄúChocolate, Daddy.‚Äù I said, swallowing my lunch. 

Dad chuckled, and somewhere in the back, Cartwright started laughing. 

Starting as quiet giggles, they became full on guffaws. 

Star-man ignored him. 

‚ÄúThat's right, Princess.‚Äù

I nodded, heading back up the stairs. 

Greeting my brother, I cranked the Alexa to full volume. 

I always listen to music when I'm doing my homework. 

Filling a glass of water, I held it to Ethan‚Äôs lips with *three* fingers. 

Ethan downed it in *three* gulps, and then nodded in one single motion. 

Star-man may be a highly intelligent psychopath, but he is yet to notice my brother is not as brain dead as he thinks. 

Yes, he still watches TV. 

But he's also *thinking*.

Dad is under the impression my twin doesn't need to be under his control. 

But Ethan has been planning. 

And slowly, over days, weeks, months, he has been putting together our escape plan. 

It has been 1,400 days since Ethan and I tried to escape our father. 

1,370 days since we started to scratch our days of captivity into the door. 

10 days until we turn eighteen.

Also, please let me know if this isn't okay to post here! I didn't see anything about it in the rules, but I totally could have missed something)

Hi, everyone! I've been reading Tarot cards as a hobby for years, and am curious if there are any bars, coffee shops, or other ""third spaces"" in the Englewood area that would be interested in having me around a few times a month (or even a few times a year) to do readings. (Feel free to take a generous interpretation of ""Englewood area"", FWIW; I have reliable transportation and can get to most places fairly easily with enough notice)

My day job is in the nonprofit sector, so something like this would help pay the bills -- I'd be happy to offer quick/simple readings for tips or donations, and only actually charge a set price for more elaborate readings. Beyond that, it's just fun to get the practice and have a chance to read for people I haven't read for before, especially around the Halloween season. It wouldn't be a particularly big production; I'm at about a 4/10 on the woo-woo scale, and would basically just plunk down in a corner with my cards and a small tabletop sign and/or signup sheet for a few hours unless the venue wanted something more elaborate for some reason.

I can think of a few places where this might fit the vibe, but I'd imagine they get people cold-calling them about stuff like this all the time, so that probably wouldn't be the best move on my part.

So, yesterday afternoon, I was supposed to meet my friend at this coffee shop to study for a big test. I had everything planned out‚Äînotes ready, my highlighters organized by color (ADHD hyper-focus moment), and I was actually on time for once. I leave the house feeling pretty proud of myself.

On the way, I realize I‚Äôm low on gas. I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúNo problem, I‚Äôll just stop real quick.‚Äù I pull into the gas station, start filling up, and while I‚Äôm waiting, I see this cute snack display inside. I tell myself, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just going to grab a snack really quick.‚Äù

I head inside, and, of course, I get totally distracted. There are these colorful keychains on the counter, and I start messing with them, then I notice the scratch-off tickets, and I think, ‚ÄúHey, maybe today‚Äôs my lucky day.‚Äù So, I grab one and a snack and head back to the car.

Except‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no car. It‚Äôs just gone. I stand there, staring at the empty pump for like five seconds, freaking out, before I realize‚Ä¶ I never moved the car. I just left it sitting there after I filled it up, with the keys still in the ignition.

I run back to the pump, praying it hasn‚Äôt been stolen, and yep, there it is. Just chilling at the gas station, engine running, completely unattended. No one even touched it. I mean, who leaves a car running for 10 minutes without noticing?! Me, apparently.

I quickly hop back in, feeling like a complete idiot, and drive off, still on time but totally rattled. I didn‚Äôt even eat the snack.

Hey there,

I (32 F) recently got an ADHD diagnosis, and am worried that the process was not thorough enough and I may have just been influenced by social media. Worried about the legitimacy of my diagnosis (I have concerns about my care provider), and am just wondering if anyone has gone through a similar experience?

Background:

Back in my college years, my Dad had expressed an opinion that I may have ADHD, but I disregarded it because I didn‚Äôt feel like I related to my understanding of it. 

Like lots of people, I started ‚Äúlearning‚Äù more about ADHD symptoms via social media within the last couple of years, and felt that I recognized myself in a lot of the symptoms that were being discussed.

Examples‚Ä¶

Losing things like phone and car keys was an every day, multiple times a day experience. Very common for me to forget my work laptop, forget or lose work keys, have had to get keys/debit cards/ids replaced multiple times. 

So many other things as well‚Ä¶ like leaving doors open (examples: once left back door wide open all night, it then rained and flooded house. Have left car doors literally open all night more than once. Have left phone outside all night.)

Starting lots of little projects all over the place, leaving a tornado behind me, both at home and work.

Forgetting/missing important meetings and appointments, lots of things for work.

In school, could not complete assignments until right before due or extremely overdue. Still did well in school despite this. Hard to remember elementary school, but I do remember getting in trouble for talking too much in class every year. 

Struggles with interrupting people, even in professional settings. Struggles sitting still (always needing to fiddle with things).

Lots of money management issues. Impulsive decisions, etc.

Once missed a flight because I was literally just sitting and staring into space. 

Granted, the most extreme things have always happened during times of stress or emotional turmoil/intensity. 

I‚Äôve always managed well and worked in fast paced environments where high pressure has seemed to help me succeed, but after having children, things became insanely overwhelming and I was struggling to cope with managing everything. I had my children back to back (14 months apart), and they are now toddlers. Life is chaotic and wonderful, but extremely overwhelming.  Biggest thing that led me to seek out some help was just the extreme emotions I was experiencing and felt unable to cope with. That‚Äôs always been an issue, but I felt like it was coming to a breaking point. 

Went to a local institute that I was referred to through my insurance company. Met with a nurse practitioner, talked about symptoms, and she wrote a referral to go get an evaluation done by what sounded like some kind of ADHD-Diagnosis-Mill.

Had trouble connecting with this place, and just kind of kept forgetting about it. 

A year went by and I decided to pursue it again. Met with same nurse practitioner again, and it was a very short meeting.

We didn‚Äôt really go as in depth again on my symptoms, as it sounded like she had made up her mind that I did have ADHD and the screening was merely a formality to put in the file for her supervising psychiatrist to review. Afterwards, she took me aside and tried to interest me in signing up for her side-hustle life insurance business, which kind of flattered me at first but then made me question her legitimacy as a health care provider. She even texted me multiple times on my cell phone in the weeks leading up to the assessment, inviting me to her ‚Äúfinancial freedom‚Äù webinars.

Took the assessment, it was super basic. Sat me in front of computer, had to click when the pattern repeated. I felt like they played distracting click noises through the headset somehow to make me want to look in the corner. I did get very bored with the test, but I‚Äôm worried that I may have been exaggerating my head movement in order to get a certain result.

I never got to see the results myself, but on the next meeting with nurse practitioner she said that the result confirmed a diagnosis and that we could start medication. Afterwards, she showed me some more personal projects, a dramatic series for YouTube that she had written and starred in. I love creative people, but I guess it just felt weird seeing something so personal from a care provider. 

Started on Adderrall XR 20 mg. First few days were the biggest difference. I could take care of things without feeling all of the internal resistance I usually do. When I got off track, I found it easy to get back to what I was supposed to be doing. I noticed was that I stopped losing/forgetting things. There were also little things like noticing that I didn‚Äôt have to rely of caffeine or sweets in the afternoon as a ‚Äúpick me up‚Äù to  motivate me through the end of the day. Also stopped feeling the need to be on my phone all the time. Appetite waned a bit, but I actually found it was easier for me to remember to stop what I was doing and eat when needed (typically am the type of person to forget to eat all day). 

After about a week, I started my period and felt like the medication stopped working entirely. I also started crashing HARD in the afternoons and evenings. Like barely able to function, just totally struggling through the evenings with my kids. Household chores started falling apart, and house just became a total disaster. Nothing getting done.

Had a follow-up and discussed the crashes and evening fatigue. Asked about maybe getting a booster dose. Nurse practitioner suggested revisiting the topic again closer to when refill time would be, and maybe just trying a different medicine altogether at that time. Again, she broached the topic of one of her side gigs and asked if she could come to my workplace to disperse literature on her financial services side business, which made me feel strange and, again, question her legitimacy. 

I took a couple of days off of the medication and was very poorly affected by it. Extreme fatigue, felt like it wasn‚Äôt even safe to drive.

Around this time, started worrying that I had been diagnosed as part of some kind of trend, that the institute I had gone to was motivated to give out diagnoses, and that I had become addicted to a medication that I now couldn‚Äôt come off of without severely impacting my life.

Could not handle the fatigue, so restarted the medication and started drinking electrolytes/taking vitamins. Also stopped drinking coffee in the mornings (I started waiting until noon), and afternoon crashes improved dramatically (although I still feel like my household is falling apart because I lack the energy in the evenings to catch up on chores). 

Around refill time, felt like things had improved enough to not need a change or boost on the medication, especially since I had become leery/worried about dependence. Decided to start some birth control on my next cycle to see if that helped in the week preceding and during my period. 

Waiting for my next period to start now (still haven‚Äôt started BC since it needs to begin on Day 1 of cycle), and am having struggles again. Becoming a mega bitch in the evenings, don‚Äôt want to be touched at all, everything is setting me off. I‚Äôm snapping at people I care about, and I‚Äôve never been so irritable before. 

I still am struggling with worries that I‚Äôve made a mistake by pursuing the diagnosis. I‚Äôm worried that my care provider was too hasty in the diagnosis, perhaps not out of my best interest? I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôve become dependent on the medication, and am worried it wasn‚Äôt necessary. 



That was‚Ä¶ long‚Ä¶ but I guess I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience, or has thoughts/advice?

Long story short, I‚Äôve started seeing a 38 year old guy, I‚Äôm 24. We met cause I was a barista at a coffee shop he went to and I would sometimes get lunch at the place he worked. I always thought he was cute and one time he flirted with me while I was eating there.

I ended up getting fired a few days after that, so I didn‚Äôt really see him anymore. About 6 months later, I decide to download Grindr just to see who is nearby. I usually hate Grindr but I thought what do I have to lose, right? I see him on there. I message him a photo of me and ask if he remembers me, and he does. He asks to get together.

He took me to get drinks about a week ago, and we got together again a few days ago to get ice cream and then had a campfire at my house. That night things got a little hot and heavy, but no penetrative sex has happened yet. But anyway, we‚Äôve had very good chemistry and attraction so far.

When we first started talking, he knows I‚Äôm trans and he mentioned his ex was trans girl and that he was once married to a trans man (again, he‚Äôs almost 40, so not crazy for him to have been married.) 

I see this progressing further and I could definitely see us dating if things continue well. This would be my first real relationship. I want to make sure I‚Äôm not getting involved with a possible chaser or an egg. I don‚Äôt think the fact that he‚Äôs been with trans people before AUTOMATICALLY makes him a chaser.

It's wild because I thought I'd never felt so sure someone was giving me signs and nudging me along, but I really did just read into things!

Regardless, after that info I told her I was in a poly relationship. I'm going to be around this person a little while longer at least, so I'd still rather be transparent than they think I tried cheating or something if my partner comes up at some point

well, maybe there is a lesson learned? try only looking in apps i guess? things will be fine, but I am inherently awkward regardless of my relationship with people, so I will be awkward for sure now and just do my best to treat them as I did before. still, nothing ventured nothing gained, so no regrets.

1fzftzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/1fzftzq/12_woman_lost_in_slc/,12 (Wo)Man Lost in SLC,"I am a 52 year old woman on day 54 of living out of my car in SLC, Utah. After 7 years and nearly $100k in rent, I lost my housing.  Two days before I lost my housing, the love of my life, my 15 year old Shihtzu, took his last breath. It was a double whammy I don't wish on my worst enemy.  I spent days 1-24, wasting away in my 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander with 240k miles, hoping that I would simply just cease to exist.  And while my once athletic frame went down 18 lbs, that didn't happen.  So I persevered, working door dash shifts, making $3-5 an order, shamefully putting my $4 in change on the 7-11 counter for gas and  making a pit stop at my aging parents every now and then to pick up a couple protein bars and bottled waters.  I began making a concerted effort to live.  And I'm happy to report, I continue to do so. Unfortunately that is about all one can do out here unhoused. I have quickly learned that about 90% of a person's energy must be used simply to survive...to take care of ones basic needs. Its very easy for me to see now, how one never makes it back.  And that's a frightening thought. I am alone, scared, and on more difficult days like today, questioning if I can rebuild my life.  And despite my need to be ridiculously independent and do things ""on my own,"" it has become pretty evident when I look in the mirror and see the wrinkles that appear to have developed overnight, that i cannot do it on my own.  I have spent countless hours trying to determine where it might be safe for someone who can't use a public bathroom without buying something, to ask for help.  And I kept coming back to one place: The 12th man.  
You see, i grew up in Bothell, WA, where my number one cheerleader, my Father, coached and was a PE Teacher in Northshore School District.  I graduated from Inglemoor and scholarshipped my way to Whitman College. Unlike many of my peers, however, life did not follow a straight trajectory.  Perhaps this was because I inherited my Mother's quest to understand the meaning of life, along with a brain prone to depression and anxiety.  Couple this with my Dad's risk taking personality, which for me, tended to rear it's ugly head in my choice of men and it's easy to understand why my ""chosen paths"" have not been easy. 
But 3 things have consistently given my life purpose:  1. Espresso...from working at By the Rail Espresso at the Monorail to helping open up the Starbucks market in Tucson, Arizona, the art of making an incredible cup of coffee has provided me a consistent source of income.  
2. Advocacy... Growing up with a Mother diagnosed with mental illness I spent several years advocating for her to get the help she so desperately needed.  After finally discovering a  treatment regimen that coupled Western Medicine with CBT and extensive trauma therapy, this incredibly resilient mother of 4 went on to get her Ph.D at age 50.  I would go on and continue to advocate for the rights, voice, and choice of individuals diagnosed with mental illness.  It definitely has helped give my life purpose and make sense of some of my most difficult experiences.     
3. The Seattle Seahawks...the first game I went to was back in the 80's.  I would have been about 10 years old. And while I can't remember Jim Zorn throwing a touch down back then, I CAN recount seeing him once again, years later with the live ""Seahawk"" perched on his arm.  And I can certainly recount the way being a part of the Seahawks family has made me feel.   Whether I was watching some no name rookie QB named Russell Wilson take over mid game with 20 other crazed Hawks fans at a college bar in Tucson or I was sitting amidst thousands of green and blues, anxiously awaiting kickoff against the Oakland Raiders in the Hawks Nest, I felt like I was one of the family.  I felt what I have been searching for all my life: that I belonged.  I hope to one day get back to the Northwest and back to the place I belong.  But right now I need help to make it to tomorrow. I am currently at a gas station in Draper, Utah with no gas.  I have been stuck here for a couple hours and am hopeful someone will reach out with some help.

Hello, I 21F learned something about myself today. So, I lost my mom in a house fire almost five years ago, and it has been extremely hard. I didn‚Äôt get diagnosed with my OCD and depression until after this happened because I went to grief therapy for a year right after this happened. I didn‚Äôt have the happiest childhood; I was constantly stressed out and took on a lot of the weight my mom felt as I was the oldest, and my mom was a single parent barely getting by who did everything to make sure my sister and I were spoiled and taken care of. So, in this fire, I lost my childhood, my mental health retook the front seat, and I lost everything from my childhood. Little me has definitely been struggling all these years. I am now an adult and finally feel a bit adultish for the first time since this incident; I finally don‚Äôt feel trapped at 16. It could be because I am a bit more financially stable, which contributes to my treating myself better. My family doesn‚Äôt understand and thinks it‚Äôs childish, but I love buying things created while I was growing up, mainly stuff I had or wanted when I was around 5-10. I got Funko Pops from a movie and show I loved growing up, and I realized how much joy these items bring me. I realized it‚Äôs because my inner child can be happy. It‚Äôs a small gesture compared to what has happened, but genuinely, I feel like I have a piece of myself back that I wasn‚Äôt entirely aware was struggling so badly for so long. I am, of course, not spending frivolously, but I am just doing a little things here and there instead of going for coffee. Anyways I wanted to share it because I am truly happy with finding this out.

So last Sunday my coworker crush asked me for my number. (We had only ever talked at work 2 times) We spent like 8 hours talking that day. He said he‚Äôd been wanting to talk to me for a while but someone else told him I was married‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Anyway, he also said I apparently gave him some seductive look when we were talking at work that day and he just wanted to grab me and kiss me. So I guess that‚Äôs why he asked for my # 
He asked me to hangout the next day just to get coffee and talk (no sex). He said he likes to get to know the person first and go on a few dates. So I went, it was nice we spent 4 hours together. Made out a bit and did some other things lol. He had asked me if he ends up falling for me am I open to a relationship or I‚Äôm not looking for that, I told him I was open to it (even tho those weren‚Äôt my initial intentions with him, I didn‚Äôt think he would be the relationship type) 
Fast forward to Saturday (it‚Äôs a weekend job) he text me in the morning to lmk he wasn‚Äôt feeling so great and to not take it personally that he‚Äôs not himself. But he greeted me with a big smile and hugged me in front of people. Then when we were leaving he hugged and kissed me goodbye. I was sitting in my car about to leave and he came over to talk to me, that was that. Then on Sunday he came to my area and held my hand and talked to me for a while. I asked him if we were gonna hangout this week and he said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see‚Äù and that was the second time he told me that (he originally asked me out for Friday and when I asked if we were still gonna he said I‚Äôll see‚Ä¶.) so I started feeling some kinda way bc like what so while at work still I texted him to be like if you don‚Äôt wanna go on dates that‚Äôs totally okay, but do you even wanna hangout casually bc ur hard to read. And he was like I do but I‚Äôm afraid if we do it and then you know‚Ä¶ (I catch feelings) and then I think he‚Äôs like every other asshole guy bc he isn‚Äôt ready for a relationship rn. I told him that he was the one who mentioned a relationship and those were not my intentions I just wanna have fun anyway. But he was saying he doesn‚Äôt like to just have sex right away, it takes him time bc he wants to get to know me so the conversation ended with him saying ‚Äúwe can go on dates‚Äù and I said ok so lmk when and he left me on read. Then he didn‚Äôt say bye to me‚Ä¶.. even tho I‚Äôm pretty sure he saw me. I texted him saying ‚ÄúI was gonna say bye to you but you were busy ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ima stop bothering you now have a good week‚Äù and I regret sending that!!!! He left it on DELIVERED!!!! but hasn‚Äôt unfollowed me on ig. I have not texted him since. 

I feel like maybe he thinks I just wanna use him for sex and I was kinda tryna rush it when he stated from the beginning he doesn‚Äôt do it right away. Or I also gave him the ICK. I‚Äôm just sad üò≠ I feel like I ruined my chance. I want to apologize‚Ä¶ i feel like my last message maybe came across as petty or clingy or just icky.

I've been feeling more drained and stressed out than ever.¬†

I was getting frustrated with how fatigue and constant stress were affecting my mood, energy, and even sleep.

A colleague recommended trying out natural supplements so I decided to test out a few top rated ones from Amazon to see if they can help.

**Ashwagandha by Physician‚Äôs Choice**

I decided to try Physician‚Äôs Choice Ashwagandha for its great reviews, and honestly, it‚Äôs effective for managing stress.¬†

It‚Äôs particularly good at balancing cortisol levels, which is key for reducing stress. One of the best things about it is that it‚Äôs paired with black pepper for better absorption.

The only con I‚Äôve experienced is some mild stomach discomfort if I take it without food, so I recommend taking it with meals.

**Nature‚Äôs Bounty Magnesium**

This supplement helps with muscle relaxation and promotes a feeling of calm, which has been helpful for those stressful days at work.¬†

I also found it to be super effective at reducing those random muscle cramps I used to get.¬†

One downside, though, is that it can act as a mild laxative if you take too much, so I‚Äôd suggest sticking to the recommended dose.¬†

**Suntheanine L-Theanine by Sports Research**

This one is a bit unique because it doesn‚Äôt make me drowsy, but it promotes relaxation and mental clarity. I take it before work if I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed.¬†

What I love most is that it pairs well with coffee, so you can get your caffeine kick without the jitters. But, I noticed that the effect can wear off after a few hours.

**Rhodiola Rosea by Terranics**

I tried Terranics Rhodiola Rosea because I heard it‚Äôs great for combating fatigue and boosting energy, and it‚Äôs lived up to the hype.

After about two weeks, I noticed a major improvement in my overall energy levels and mood, especially on those tough, burnout days.¬†

It‚Äôs also been great for enhancing mental clarity without making me jittery.¬†

**NOW Foods 5-HTP**

5-HTP converts into serotonin, the ""feel-good"" hormone, so I take it when I‚Äôm feeling particularly overwhelmed or down.¬†

It‚Äôs very effective for promoting a positive mood and easing stress, especially in the evenings.¬†

But it can make you a little drowsy so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for daytime use unless you‚Äôre okay with the possibility of feeling sleepy.¬†

**My Final Thoughts:**

After trying all of these, the one that‚Äôs worked best for me is the Physician‚Äôs Choice Ashwagandha.¬†

It‚Äôs the most balanced in terms of addressing both stress and fatigue without any major side effects, and it‚Äôs become a staple in my daily routine.¬†

The calm energy and improved sleep have made the biggest impact on how I feel.¬†

If you‚Äôre looking for something that works well for overall stress management, I definitely recommend starting here!",2,1728435878.0,NoMoreStress,2,1.0,False

I even had days when I did 21 hours which is quite an achievement for me, but my weight doesn't seem to be going down (well the amount gone down technically could be attributed to daily fluctuation)... 

I'm pretty sure it's fine from what I read, but during my fast I do drink bullet proof coffee to wake me up in the morning. Aside from that I just drink herbal tea. Could that be the issue? 

Aside from that I have also pretty much been alcohol free (which is why I am able to fast for those hours, previously I always drink into the evenings. ) I also been told I'm iron deficient, so I started taking iron tablets, and also metamucil (again, shouldn't break fast right)

Unfortunately I'm a foodie, so during my eating window I do tend to hit the carb hard.

I have known/been dating my wife for 6 years, and we have been spiritually married for 2 years. We are not legally married, although at this point we are essentially common law.

We are both high earners (both earning over $175k a year after tax). We purchased our home together and we have agreed to split the finances 50-50. We paid for our wedding, honeymoon, everything 50-50, althoughl1 did pay for the cost of our rings and her engagement ring. Our mortgage payments were 50-50 and we comfortably own our home now, so much of our income goes to savings, investments, home improvements and discretionary spending.

Because of our incomes, we felt it would be best to keep our finances separate - we're both highly independent people and both very care driven. It's part of the reason I'm so attracted to her - she's amazing at what she does, and I'm so proud to be able to introduce her as my wife and explain what she does.

Unfortunately our first two years of marriage were hampered by COVID and lockdowns. We would have loved to have traveled and saved up quite a bit in order to do this. A couple months ago we had a talk and decided it might be a good time to have kids instead of continuously waiting for better or safer travel conditions. Without too serious discussion about it, we decided to stop using birth control and let things happen as they will.

Yesterday I came home and my wife was on the phone. She seemed like she was in a hurry to end her conversation and tried to evade my question when I asked who she was talking to. It was her sister. They don't talk a lot, so that was a bit weird. She still works from home, so she continued to do some work, then we had dinner and watched some news. Regular, pleasant evening. Then she says she wants to have a serious talk, and asks me to make us some tea and meet her upstairs at her work desk

I make the tea, bring it up, and she starts talking financials.

Her work place allows for maternity leave for up to a year, but only provides 50% of her salary for up to 6 months. The remaining 6 months is unpaid. She was very direct, and said that while her insurance would cover the vast majority of hospital related costs during pregnancy and childbirth, taking a 6 month break from work would cost her almost $50,000 since her pay would be cut in half. She is asking me to compensate her for that $50,000, in addition to agreeing to split any related but unexpected costs to pregnancy and childbirth. Her stance is that she is doing something for us to start a family, but it is not a true 50-50 split if she is expected to take a financial hit for it and I am not, given that our finances are separate. She had a printed list of expectations in terms of what she expected financially, listed some things that her insurance may not cover.

I see the logic in that, but I am really very turned off by this because she is essentially asking me to pay her to have our child (or children?).

She saw my hesitation and just doubled down. While her ideal is to return to work after 6 months, she says it's a real possibility that she may require more time off and decide, as things happen, to take up to a year off. So, she had another plan drafted for that. For the first 6 months, her work will give her 50% of her salary, and I would compensate her for the rest, but for the next 6 months, since her work would not compensate her, and because it is something she is doing for the family, she is ""comfortable splitting the loss of her income"", and only asking me for 50% of her sarary instead of 100% for the second 6 month period, and she will take the loss of 50% of her salary. The idea I guess is that both of us ""suffer"" half the loss of income for the second 6 month period. However, if she takes 7 to 11 months off, any months after the 6th can be prorated,.

She expressed that she anticipates and hopes to return to work in 6 months, but that she wants a contingency plan in the event that she requires a year off. She said that taking more than a year off is something she is very unlikely to do as it would put her job at risk, but that she's open to exploring a third plan with me if I feel that it's necessary.

There are also detailed notes about how she wants to keep housework split, with plans to start saving for both childcare and additional housekeeper expenses for at least the first four years. I kid you not, it's a 16 page ring binder that she handed me with detailed notes, some explanations, and lists of expenses.

But the immediate and essential element here is that, she wants me to pay her $50,000 - $100,000 to compensate for the loss of her salary for 6-12 months as a result of her having our child.

I really do not know how to process this. My first thought is shock because, despite our salaries, $50k-$100k is a lot to demand. The idea of a payment plan to have a child iS just gross. And many couples manage to do this without paying their wives to have children. But then, suppose most couples are married legally and a loss to one person's income is a loss to everyone. So in our situation, it makes logical sense, but there's something so transactional about it that puts a bad taste in my mouth.

I didn't fight it or argue, and she's basically allowing me to think about it, but says if having kids is something were going to do, she wants to write up an agreement and go to a lawyer (splitting the cost of that is ALSO in the binder).

What really hits me here is that she was talking to her sister on the same day she brings this up to me. Why on that day? On the same day she mentions this to me? They do not talk often. am partially excited and scared that the timing of this means that she is actually currently pregnant and that my response to her will have real consequences if I disagree with her. She has previously had an abortion, and only told me after the fact (almost a year later), because it was early into dating. I was shocked to learn that when I did, but supported her choice as it's her body, and at the time having kids would have been the wrong decision for us. Still, the fact that she makes decisions like that so independently has me incredibly cautious right now.

I checked trash cans and such for a pregnancy test but didn't find anything. She also asked for tea instead of coffee, but maybe that is overthinking it because she likes both. I want to ask her if she's pregnant, but we both had busy days today, and I was processing and it didn't even occur to me on the day we first discussed this. Definitely a conversation to have, but I don't know whether that should influence my response here.

tl;dr. My wife and I both earn over $175k a year and we are considering having children. She is asking me to compensate her for 6 to 12 months as compensation for the time she will have to take off to have our child. I do not know whether she is pregnant
