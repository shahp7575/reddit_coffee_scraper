My doctor had me start with 5mg in the morning, and try taking a second 5mg dose later in the day if I don't have any side effect. 

I just tried taking a second dose after a few weeks of only taking it in the morning. At this point, my morning dose feels pretty normal. No crazy changes in mood or energy, but still enough to help me feel better and be more focused. I sometime even feel like I need a bit of caffeine like a cup of tea or a small cup of coffee to make it through the morning.

Today, I took my second dose five hours after my first dose. It feels a lot like the first time I ever took adderall. Much more intense. Still able to be productive, but a little too much stimulation.

Entry 1 

I have no idea what's going on right now and im scared



When I woke up yesterday, something felt off. It's not even that it felt off, it smelled wrong; like someone had used a power saw to chop up wood in my room. I slipped on some flannel pyjama pants and a day-old shirt I found on the floor and headed downstairs.
 Usually on a sunday morning my mom would be in the kitchen frying up bacon while scrambling eggs muttering to herself about how something always burns. Instead my mom was sitting at the kitchen table completely motionless, her hands wrapped around her coffee cup. I could tell the cup was still warm from the steam wafting out of the mug. Then my heart sank. She wasn‚Äôt breathing, She wasn‚Äôt blinking, She was as still as a murder victim in a horror flick.
Her eyes were like glass orbs. I mean that literally, Reflective, rounded, and just slightly too large for her face. Her skin looked smooth at first‚Äîalmost too smooth‚Äîuntil I got closer and realized it wasn‚Äôt skin at all. It was wood. Pale, polished wood with tiny carved lines where her mouth should be. Her nose was a perfect triangle. Like something you'd see on a marionette in a creepy puppet theater, not on your mother.
I called her name. I shook her. I screamed. Nothing. Her head flopped over a little when I grabbed her shoulders; like a doll weighted wrong. I thought maybe it was just her. A stroke? A seizure? A delusion? So I ran outside. That‚Äôs when I saw Mr. Jeffers, our neighbor, standing on his porch in a baby blue bathrobe and bright pink slippers. Just standing. Not moving. Not breathing. His mouth was frozen in a permanent smile, carved deep and wide into his wooden face. A bluebird landed on his shoulder and pecked at his cheek and he didn‚Äôt flinch. Didn‚Äôt even twitch.
Everyone on the street was like that. My neighbours sat completely still in cars that were still running in their driveways. A lawn mower sat abandoned mid-lap across someone‚Äôs yard while its owner was lying flat in the grass. A mail carrier frozen mid-step with one leg in the air. I think I screamed, then fell over before scurrying back inside like a scared bunny rabbit. That day was a blur, I tried to call an ambulance, nobody picked up. I biked to other neighbourhoods looking for someone, anyone who would help. It was the same story no matter where I went. So I went back home.
I stayed inside for hours, waiting for someone to knock, to say it was a prank, a chemical leak, a dream. But no one did. I found myself eating an entire box of cereal. Then I puked it up. Not because it was bad. Just because I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking.
It‚Äôs the next morning now. Or the morning after that. I haven‚Äôt slept. I don‚Äôt think I can. Everyone is still there. All of them. Not dead. Just... paused. Or puppets. I don‚Äôt know what to call them. But it‚Äôs like the world stopped moving without me; and I‚Äôm the only one who didn‚Äôt get turned off. 
Please, If you're reading this, tell me I‚Äôm not the only one.


Entry 2

I think they're moving but I really can't be sure as of right now 

I don't think I imagined it. I thought maybe I was sleep-deprived, possibly Hallucinating. But I swear, I saw the mailman tilt his head yesterday. Just a little. Just enough to peer over at my house. I froze when I saw it. For a second, I doubted it moved. But then he blinked.
Then this morning, I noticed Mr. Jefferson wasn't on the porch anymore.They‚Äôre moving. Not all at once. Not like a switch flipped. But gradually‚Äîjerkily‚Äîlike marionettes remembering they have strings again.
My mom is in a different position now. It's not like she's in a different room or anything, she‚Äôs still at the kitchen table, but her coffee cup is tipped over, and her hand is on the tablecloth like she was reaching for something to dry the coffee with. I know I didn't move it. I didn‚Äôt touch anything.
At first I thought maybe I knocked it over when I was shaking her the other day. But I know I didn't knock it over then. Whatever happened I still needed to clean up the spill. As I went upstairs to grab a towel I nearly had a heart attack. My sister, or her puppet ( I don't know what to call them) was standing in the doorway of her room. I had actually forgotten about her; being wrapped up in whatever was going on around here, but now she‚Äôs upright. Silent. Her painted eyes staring at me, wide, wrong, and grinning.
I rushed over and slammed her door shut and shoved a chair from my room up under the door knob. Not because I thought it would help. But because I needed to do something.
Something‚Äôs happening. Something‚Äôs waking them up. And then‚Ä¶ just now‚Ä¶ I got an email notification. I popped open my laptop, it sprung to life, surprisingly still connected to Wi-Fi Somehow. I pulled up the new email hoping someone had seen my post from earlier. But the website was wrong everywhere it should have read Gmail it now read Gtree., i scrolled down to the new treemail i guess 
The sender read mariennettNewsNetwork@gtree.com. No subject. Just a single file: ""welcome_back.mp4""
I clicked it.

First came the sound ‚Äî a warped xylophone jingle, all wrong in tone and timing, like a corrupted children‚Äôs show theme run through a rusted music box. The screen glitched, then bloomed into a burst of red and yellow so bright it hurt to look at. The colors pulsed, oversaturated and feverish.
Then the ‚Äúnews anchor‚Äù appeared.
It was a wooden puppet in a stiff, child‚Äôs parody of a suit and tie, sitting behind a desk that looked like it had been cobbled together from toy blocks. Its mouth opened and closed with a loose, clacking rhythm, always a split-second out of sync with the voice‚Äîan eerily cheerful, robotic tone that sounded like a kindergarten teacher trapped in a loop.
‚ÄúGood morning, happy citizens!‚Äù the voice chirped.
 ‚ÄúWelcome to a bright new era!‚Äù
Above the puppet‚Äôs head, a banner read: PUPPET REALITY DAILY.
The camera angle didn‚Äôt shift. The puppet didn‚Äôt blink. It simply stared, smiling, as the voice continued.
‚ÄúToday‚Äôs top story: Reintegration Day is underway!‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWhat does that mean for you and your fellow citizens? It means joy, purpose, and glorious synchronization!‚Äù
There was a burst of static, and the puppet‚Äôs head jerked hard to the left. A beat of silence. Then it snapped back into place as if nothing had happened.
‚ÄúAny individuals experiencing confusion, dissonance, or persistent ‚Äòhuman residue‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äî and here the voice took on an odd, singsong lilt ‚Äî ‚Äúshould report to their nearest Harmonization Center immediately.‚Äù
‚ÄúYour compliance ensures a smooth and splinter-free future!‚Äù
Behind the puppet, a looping animation played: a cartoon family of wooden figures holding hands in front of a house. The same house I grew up in, maybe. The loop repeated again and again‚Äîuntil, for just a fraction of a second, one of the family members glitched. Its face contorted in a silent scream, mouth stretched too wide, eyes black and bulging.
Then it snapped back to smiling like the rest.
The puppet anchor‚Äôs voice rose one final time.
‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget our daily pledge!‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI am wood.
 I am one.
 I am willing.‚Äù
The jingle swelled again, more distorted now. The puppet grinned wider, impossibly wide.
Then the screen froze mid-note.
And cut to black.

The Wi-Fi is still running. Electricity too.  Something‚Äôs keeping the world alive‚Äîeven if it isn‚Äôt us anymore.
They‚Äôre broadcasting now. Talking to each other. Or to me.I doubt they were ever just frozen. I think they were watching. And now they‚Äôre ready.

Entry 3

I dont think it's safe here anymore. 

 After I saw that news clip on treemail I decided to make a run for it. I wasn't going to stay put anymore, I'll find someone, I know I will. At first, I thought I was dreaming. Now I know I'm not.
 This morning I found myself waking up with the sun directly overhead; I was inside a dense bush I saw in someone's yard. The sleep wasn't the best i've ever had but in my sleep-deprived state it felt heavenly. After putting my blanket back in the backpack I was using as a makeshift pillow, I crawled out from my little shrubby safe haven. 
I walked down Oak Avenue and saw Mr. Delaney, my old school bus driver. But his head was too round. His skin too smooth. And his hands made a hard clack-clack sound as they gripped the steering wheel. Just like always‚Äîsame navy jacket, same coffee-stained Yankees cap. He pulled the bus up to the curb. It had to be somewhere around noon; I found myself pretty confused as to why he was out and about with the school bus. There were no kids. No sound. Just him. Sitting there. Waiting for children who weren‚Äôt coming.
I hid behind a tree and watched. After exactly five minutes, he closed the bus doors, then he drove up the curb, slamming the front of the bus into a mailbox before he unremorsefully made the most illegal U-turn I'd ever seen in my life. Then he drove off in silence, it was like muscle memory from a life he didn't know was gone.
Further down, I saw a jogger still in a nightgown, someone I think used to be Ms. Nguyen from whatever real estate agency that kept on trying to buy the house off my mom. Her wooden knees were pumping stiffly, arms swinging too high. Her mouth was painted into a smile that never moved. When she passed me, I swear she turned her head just a little. Not all the way. Just enough to let me know she saw me. She didn‚Äôt stop running. Everything feels like‚Ä¶ like it‚Äôs been programmed, or Looped.
 The puppets have jobs, routines; they‚Äôre still doing them, even if they don‚Äôt make sense anymore. The grocery store lights were on. Music played overhead. I went in, There were no customers. However, every cashier was standing at their register. Some of them stood there unmoving, wooden eyes locked onto me like I was doing something that was taboo to them. A few cashiers scanned invisible items over and over again, the motion looping like a broken animatronic. A bagger dropped nothing into a paper sack and passed it down the conveyor belt to no one.
I backed out slowly. I didn‚Äôt want to be noticed. I don‚Äôt think they want me gone.
 But I don‚Äôt think they want me to interfere either. Something is‚Ä¶ keeping the world running. Not alive. Just moving.
I was eating a can of cold beans by flashlight in the abandoned tech section of a walmart. The tvs were still running now and all of them were showing that new news station ‚ÄúMNN‚Äù or marinnett news network.
There was no warning this time. No jingle. Just a crackle of static and a voice‚Äîbright, bubbly, and wrong.

‚ÄúAttention! Attention!
 This is your daily guidance from the Office of Orderly Living!‚Äù
The voice was sharper now. Not cheerful like the first time‚Äîmore forced. Like it was smiling with clenched teeth.
‚ÄúAll citizens must now report for weekly inspections! That‚Äôs right! Your health, your shine, and your synchronization must be evaluated for optimal performance!‚Äù

The words slithered into my ears like splinters. I could hear the capital letters.
I didn‚Äôt even need a screen to picture it anymore. I saw the puppet anchor in my mind‚Äîjaw clicking up and down, head slightly crooked. Behind it, I imagined a cartoon graphic: a puppet sitting on a tiny exam table while another scraped its joints with a file and polished its cheeks until they gleamed.
The voice shifted tone‚Äîslower, lower, like it was reading a warning label no one ever reads.
‚ÄúRot is a crime.
 Deviation is disobedience.
 Self-direction is a splintering hazard.‚Äù
There was a beat of static. And then something else crept in‚Äîa faint mechanical whine, like a saw blade spinning up in the distance.
‚ÄúRefusal to attend inspection will result in‚Ä¶ immediate repurposing.‚Äù
My skin crawled. I pictured another graphic, too vivid: limbs unscrewed and reattached in new shapes. Faces carved into benches. A puppet laughing as its own smile was nailed into place.Then, as before, the voice snapped back into cheer.
‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget our daily pledge!‚Äù
I mouthed the words before they came‚Äîlike a spell being recited over and over until it loses all meaning:
I am wood.
I am one.
I am willing.


Entry 4 
I broke one, i didn't mean to they're just fragile 
I don‚Äôt know what I was expecting. Maybe that there was still a person in there, somewhere. Maybe I thought if I just shook one hard enough, if I pulled hard enough, they'd snap out of it. Like sleepwalking. Like a bad dream.
It happened this morning. I walked into a part of town I don‚Äôt normally go to‚Äîan older neighborhood, the kind of place that‚Äôs always felt distant,or rundown like a different world. Maybe that‚Äôs why I picked it. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I wanted to see any familiar faces. I just wanted answers. I needed to know what‚Äôs left of all this.
Soon I found my target, a random cashier at Mrs. Roth‚Äôs bakery, an older looking puppet with gray curls and a permanent smile, stood behind the counter, constantly handing out bread and cookies then dropping them on the floor. She stood there performing her job except there were no customers to take the goodies. when I stepped inside, she instantly froze. The puppet stood there motionless. Still in her apron, Still smiling that same, frozen smile. Her eyes, though... there was nothing behind them. Just glass.
I stood there for a long time. Just staring at her. I don‚Äôt even know why I didn‚Äôt leave. Maybe I thought if I stayed long enough, she‚Äôd blink. Maybe if I waited, the human part of her would come back. thenI walked closer. Took one step. Then another. And then I whispered, softly; ‚Äúhello? Is anyone there?‚Äù No response.
I reached for her shoulder first, her wooden body was cold to the touch. Too cold. The way plastic feels. Or the way you imagine a mannequin might feel. I swallowed hard and grabbed her wrist instead. It was lighter than it should have been. Hollow. Like it had been emptied out, like the wood was carved thin, and the skin was only a layer over the emptiness. I don‚Äôt even think I meant to pull that hard. I thought it would be like tugging a blanket or shaking someone awake.
But when I yanked I heard a loud CRACK. Like the wrist had no more give. It was as if it wasn‚Äôt a joint anymore. Just a fragile piece of furniture. My stomach dropped, I don't know why I felt so sickened by my actions. 
Then the arm fell off, I couldn‚Äôt even catch it. It fell to the ground with a clack, rolling slightly before stopping. The woman's head tipped to the side, her smile didn't waver. Her eyes stayed wide open.
I just stood there. And I stared. Stared at her hand in mine, then the arm on the floor. I didn‚Äôt scream. I didn‚Äôt even cry. I just dropped the hand, turned around, And walked out of that bakery like it wasn‚Äôt real. I must have ran for miles. Through streets I didn‚Äôt recognize, just trying to get away. attempting  to get my feet to move faster and faster.
They‚Äôre not asleep. They‚Äôre not dreaming. They‚Äôre finished. They‚Äôre locked in place standing rigid, empty. Set in motion until something or someone comes around to pull their strings. And I can‚Äôt change it, I can‚Äôt fix it, I can‚Äôt even wake them up.I think I knew that deep down. But it hurts more, having tried.

Entry 5

Breaking her was a mistake 

I didn‚Äôt mean to stop, I was just passing through one of the outer neighborhoods; cookie-cutter houses that all looked the same. Like they‚Äôd been stamped out of some suburban mold, painted black and white. Nothing Seemed to have moved out here in days. The only sound was the wind rustling through the desolate trees lining the roads. 
That was it seemed that way until I heard the faint jingle of the MNN emanating from each of the houses. I could see the faint lights of a tv flashing through the curtains or blinds of each house. I wanted to know what the puppets were going to do next, so I snuck onto each porch I came across until I found one, there was a crack big enough to see the whole tv. I crept closer, staying low. Pressed myself flat against the concrete siding. The window was half-open, I could clearly see Inside, a puppet family sat in a living room frozen in perfect domestic bliss. A father-puppet on the recliner. A mother-puppet on the couch with a tea cup glued to her wooden fingers. Two smaller ones on the carpet between them, cross-legged, staring ahead with glassy, painted-on eyes. The TV was on. And that voice was back.

‚ÄúSpecial bulletin! This is a priority transmission from Puppet Reality Daily!‚Äù
The anchor-puppet on the screen looked newer than the others‚Äîsleek varnish, brighter eyes, tighter jaw hinge. Behind it, a bold red banner read:
 NON-COMPLIANT ACTIVITY DETECTED: ‚ÄúAuthorities are on high alert for an anomaly in District Seven. An unidentified non-compliant unit has tampered with a fully synchronized citizen!‚Äù
My stomach felt like it was on some kind of crazy rollercoaster, wobbling up and down left then right. I knew there was some form of communication between them. Obviously they had the news; now I know they've organized themselves beyond that. 
In my brief moment of shock I took a step back only for the floorboards under me to make a loud CREEEEK noise. I didn‚Äôt breathe. I could feel the sweat freezing on my back as I watched,half expecting the puppet children on the carpet to move, they didn't, they didn't even blink. I wondered if they even could. Or if they were just placed there, something like props on a set, arranged for the nightly performance.

‚ÄúThis act of disruption has caused irreparable damage to a loyal neighbor-unit. But don‚Äôt worry! Harmony will be restored.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe remind all citizens that tampering, resisting, or unsanctioned interaction is a punishable offense. Any ‚Äòfree expression‚Äô not aligned with group unity will be swiftly... corrected.‚Äù
‚ÄúHave you seen something strange? A unit moving against the grain? A citizen who speaks out of sync? Report all deviant behavior to your nearest Observer Drone.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd remember:
 I am wood.
 I am one.
 I am willing.‚Äù

At that moment, I became very aware of the power lines above me; of the rusted garden gnome by the gate. As well as the eerie silence all around me. I began to study the neighbourhood, I looked for anything out of place. And that's when I saw them, all of them, it didn't look like America. It looked like the system was directly imported from another country.  On each telephone pole looking in nearly every direction; dark camera bulbs embedded in the wood, one of the cameras was aimed square at the house, seemingly at me and me.	The screen on the TV froze mid-jingle,the puppet family hadn't reacted. The light flickered once, then died. Silence again. I ducked away from the window and kept moving.
They know I'm not a puppet, one of them must have reported me. Probably the one at Ms. Roth's bakery. I had a feeling the answers I wanted would come at a cost, after a few days I had come to think the punishment was my feelings of misery for breaking some-thing that used to be human; I was terribly mistaken. They were using some kind of camera system to track my movements. 
I didn't think. I didn't even contemplate my next move; I ran. I ran as hard and fast as my legs would go. There was no stopping to look back. There was no shaking the feeling they were about to start hunting me. I wanted to get as far from civilization as I could. Neighborhoods, stores, and parks aren't safe anymore. 

Entry 6

I think they know I'm still human. I'm hiding now. I don't know how much longer I have

I used to think I was invisible. In the beginning, I walked through town like a ghost. The puppet people didn‚Äôt flinch when I passed. They just stood there like statues posed in still-life scenes of old routines, clutching briefcases, watering plants. It was like I didn‚Äôt register at all.
But that‚Äôs changed. I noticed the first one three days ago; It was on Main Street, standing by the library steps. Not like the others. This one moved. It jerked its head in mechanical ticks, scanning left and right. Its body was stained a deep, unnatural blue‚Äîthe wood polished to a mirror shine, almost wet-looking under the sun. Its eyes glowed faintly; White then blue, Like LED bulbs on top of the now unused cop cars. That's why I took to calling them the puppet police. 
I stayed hidden in a parked van until it wandered off. I told myself it was a fluke. Then I saw two more near the park. They moved in tandem, slowly patrolling the swing sets, their heads rotating independently of their torsos. One stopped in front of a sandpit, tilted its head, then stabbed a long metal rod into the ground like it was testing something.
They didn‚Äôt see me. But they were looking for something, possibly me.
Now I see them everywhere.
They patrol in pairs or threes, always blue-stained, always gleaming. They walk in slow, calculated steps, scanning streets, peering through windows, stopping by mailboxes like they remember what they‚Äôre for without remembering how they work. My days rapidly turned into a blur of searching for places to hide; I do my best to avoid them by going in odd places that would be difficult to reach. 
My closed brush with the puppet police was last night. I holled up in an old dusty attic; I decided it was a tactical spot for the night. I should be able to open or close the ceiling door from the inside if I needed to; funnily enough. If push came to shove I'd be able to kick them down the sloping attic steps, with my experience at Ms. Roth's i would hope they shatter into a million pieces upon impact with the floor underneath. 
While getting ready for bed that night I heard the front door I used to get into the house make a loud scraping noise against the uneven floorboards, those damn puppets had gotten in. hurriedly, i tiptoed my way over to the attic door and began to slowly shut the hatch. I was sadly too late, I had the door about a quarter inch away from being sealed shut when I saw the blue stained wooden foot clack against the floorboards at the end of the hall. With another ominous clack the puppet police came clear into view. I watched it from that crack in the flat attic door. I was afraid to breathe wrong or make any semblance of noise. But I was laying flat with my chest pressed up against a nail or something. Attic trash I had come to call it, most likely a remnant from the ppl that had built this place.
The pain from that tinsey point of pressure was quickly becoming too much to handle, I shifted my weight; the sound of my shirt sliding across the plywood floor emanated from the hatch like a gentle whisper. It turned its head toward me and paused for six full seconds. Then moved on. 
I layed there for around 30 more minutes after I heard the puppet take its leave from the house. I was too scared to move. I had never thought about how sensitive they're hearing actually is. I don‚Äôt cook. I barely breathe when I move through buildings now. Every sound could bring them closer. I don‚Äôt know what gave me away. Maybe the broken puppet. Maybe I‚Äôve been too loud. Or maybe they were always going to notice. I‚Äôm not like them. I don‚Äôt fit.
So I‚Äôve stopped trying to pretend. There is no meandering through open streets. No more scavenging during daylight. I‚Äôm underground now or high up in attics, crawling through basements, sleeping in ductwork, hiding in crawl spaces like a rat. If you‚Äôre out there, if anyone‚Äôs out there; please help. I'm still here. But I‚Äôm cornered. And they‚Äôre getting closer.


I haven‚Äôt written in a few days. Not because I didn‚Äôt want to. I just didn‚Äôt know how to explain what happened. I was sleeping in an old laundromat, behind a wall of busted dryers. The puppet police had passed by twice, but never came in. I stayed quiet, hidden, still.
Then I heard footsteps. Not the sharp, stilted clack of the patrols, they were similar but softer, uneven. Like someone dragging a foot.
I held my breath. And then a voice raspy, hoarse. Wooden but real, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt scream,‚Äù it said.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like them.‚Äù He stepped into view like he‚Äôd always known where I was. Like he‚Äôd been waiting for me to stop running.
He told me his name is Milo. He looks like the others: wooden joints, stiff posture, carved smile that doesn‚Äôt quite reach the eyes. But something was off. Not in a bad way at first, Milo was just; off, a little different. He blinked. Moved with a kind of stiffness that felt self-conscious, like he was learning to be human.
He told me he ‚Äúwoke up wrong.‚Äù Said he still hears annoying songs playing on loop in his head when no one's around, that he dreams of kitchens and rainstorms and birthday candles. Things he swears he never really likes but thinking about it feels good in what he said were his ‚Äúmetaphorical bones‚Äù.
We talked for a long time. He showed me how to move at night, how to avoid the puppet police patrols. Told me where to find clean water as well as what buildings are mostly abandoned.
He‚Äôs been helpful. Generous, even. Possibly too much so.
I don‚Äôt know. He watches me when I sleep. He doesn't think I notice, but I do. His smile never fades. Not even when he's quiet. Not even when there's nothing to smile about. I highly doubt he would be able to stop smiling even if he wanted to though. With it being permanently carven into his wooden face and all. 
He asks a lot of questions. Most of them were strange and felt out of place. ‚ÄúDo you ever miss being part of something bigger?‚Äù , ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be easier if you didn‚Äôt have to hide?‚Äù, or
 ‚ÄúDo you think anyone would blame you for giving up?‚Äù He says it like he‚Äôs just curious.
 But sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm being studied.
Still it's nice having someone to talk to. I don‚Äôt have anyone else. And for now, I need him.
If you're reading this: I'm okay. I think. But something tells me I shouldn‚Äôt stay in one place too long.


Post 7

Milo knows how to pick a nice crib 

The apartment we found wasn‚Äôt much, it was high up; we would hear them coming up the stairs well before any puppet could reach us. The apartment was simple but good enough for two guys on the run. Just four walls, a busted lock, and a working TV that hissed with static like a warning. Milo called it ‚Äútemporary.‚Äù Said we‚Äôd keep moving. There were no puppet sightings around here though, so we decided to stay a bit longer.
Days passed. He got quieter while I grew more paranoid. Milo never slept. I was unsure if a puppet needed to. He just... sat there. Sometimes he would watch the door, other times he would watch me. Sometimes, I‚Äôd catch him standing perfectly still, as if waiting for a cue I couldn‚Äôt hear. But Milo was always doing weird puppet shit I didn't understand, he said he couldn't help it. It was like the world would go black for a second and then he was back. 
I stopped sleeping when he ‚Äúwent dark‚Äù like that. I started sleeping with one eye open when he was present. I kept telling myself he was trying; Maybe he was more human than puppet, Maybe he wanted the same thing I did. 
But last night, the TV turned itself on. I was dozing on the floor when the static cleared. The jingle was warped, slowed down, like a children‚Äôs show melting in the sun. A puppet appeared on-screen. Its head twitched. The paint was cracked. Its mouth barely moved, like it had been forced open.

PUPPET NEWSCASTER (glitching):
‚ÄúDÃ∏Ã°ÕùeÃµÕòaÃ∂ÕùrÃµ Ã∑cÃ¥iÃ¥tÃ∂iÃ∂zÃ∏eÃ∏nÃ∏sÃ∏... congratulations... yÃ∂oÃ∑uÃ∑rÃ∂ Ã∏cÃµoÃ∂mÃ∏pÃ∂lÃ∏iÃ∂aÃ∏nÃ∑cÃ∑eÃ∂ Ã∑hÃµaÃ∑sÃ∏ Ã¥eÃ∑nÃ¥sÃ¥uÃ∂rÃ∑eÃ¥dÃ∏ Ã∂pÃ¥eÃ∑aÃ∂cÃ∑eÃ∑‚Ä¶‚Äù
Behind it, a grainy banner unfurled.
‚ÄúOPERATION: RECLAMATION ‚Äì TARGET ACQUIRED‚Äù
Then my heart hopped out of my chest when I saw His face; Not as Milo, as Special Agent Mike. Same carved smile. Same glassy eyes. Only now he wore a badge and blue varnish on his arm. He was saluting like a proud cop in a news article would. I looked over. Milo wasn‚Äôt watching the screen, instead he stared at me with a nearly murderous intent. He was watching me. His voice was cold this time. Unapologetic. ‚ÄúI told them you‚Äôd be here. I just needed you to stay still.‚Äù I ran to the window. They were everywhere. Hundreds of them. Wooden patrols marching in perfect silence, surrounding the building like termites encasing a dying tree. The TV glitched again. A final message:
‚ÄúHarmonization successful. Prepare for integration.‚Äù

He also claimed to study in the same university as both of us. And my ex somehow believed him and gave her his contact. Me and a few friends tried to make her see that he was lying . She even fixed a coffee date with him...a total stranger just a day after meeting him. She expected me to be ok for some reason but ofcourse I wasn't. I tried to ask my juniors where he claimed to study about him but no one knew who she was. After all of us tried to make her see the folly of going out with a random stranger and putting herself in danger she finally did block him, and I really thought we were trying to fix our relationship. But then yesterday, she texted me saying she was going to unblock him again. I got fed up of her constant need for attention from other guys even though we were dating and ended up blocking her from everywhere.  What kind of a ride hailing driver hits on women?

**About me:**

* I am 26
* 5'11"" and 220 lbs (average-fit build)
* Grey-Blue eyes with shorter dark blond hair
* Have a degree in Physics with all kinds of awards relating to that
* Always have worked full time even during college
* Not rich as I make $35k/year, but I fully paid off my own home and buy cheap used cars
* My favorite things to do are astronomy and long motorcycle trips

**My dating dilemma:**

I have used maybe about a dozen different apps off/on since 2019. Currently on Tinder, Facebook Dating, Bumble, Boo, and Hinge. Even pay subscriptions for all of them except Facebook Dating and Hinge. These days I get 1-3 matches a day with about 1 in 10 responding back to me. Very few I had the opportunity to text for couple of weeks.

Once in awhile I will meet some woman in real life I really like and find a way to get their socials/number in not some creepy way. Some of those I can get some long term text conversations but whenever it comes about just meeting up for coffee or something, there's always something saying they can't. Eventually I just let those go as they made it clear they are not interested in a date.

I met someone on Bumble where we were texting for 3 weeks straight. Just overall seemed wonderful. She was a RN at a local hospital and doing a masters degree, but in the first week she managed to ask ME to meet for coffee. She said had a day off in 2 weeks to meet at this coffee place at 11am on Monday (4/21). She even said she could meet sooner but ""I deserve more than 30 minutes to meet"". Everything seemed to going great up to 4/19 where I get her last text of ""It was a hella night at work. Better get to bed goodnight"". Figured she was busy but still sent her a text on 4/20 asking if she still planning on meeting. I show up on 4/21 and waited for 2 hours. Nothing at all. Asked if she was okay by text and by Bumble message. Still nothing now.

That last one really made me sad thinking I finally had a chance. Even seemed went out of her way to fit me into her busy schedule. I wish I could get some honest answers/advice on what I can do differently.

**What I have done so far:**

I use the same 6 pictures of me for everything. Carefully picking ones that show me with my interests and achievements.

* One picture of me presenting at a astrophysics conference
* Two pictures of me with my motorcycle at different landmarks in the background
* One picture me at an old observatory
* One bathroom mirror selfie
* And one of me on my roof doing roofing

When I get a match, I'm 90% of the time start asking something about their interests or something I can pick up from their pictures. Just trying to start some kind of conversation with something I put 2 minutes into thinking about. Normally it is no response or single response back.

I have figured out long ago that if you asked for a hookup, that's a immediate unmatched. So I think most likely they are reading messages?

If I send the first message asking to meet somewhere for coffee, I think I get better chances of a response. Thought it almost always is no, can't, idk, etc.

I have a lot of bad stories involving other people and dating that I could go on about. I just want ONE date and I am realizing that I spent years doing so. Maybe I can get a new idea here.",1,1746492587.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

My wife and I are splitting up (most likely) after 8 years of marriage and together for 11 years. The purpose of this post is to make sense of what has happened and try to detach in a healthy way. Maybe some insight into if I am crazy or not for thinking this way or I am to blame. 

The beginning:
We met when she was 23 and I was 28 at a bar in SF. I walked up to her and It was one of these instant connections where we went on our first date and were sleeping together and bf/gf within a month. She tells me I gave her her first real orgasm. Our relationship was very close and intimate beyond physical intimacy, we shared everything from each other. We would stay up late talking for hours and it seemed like we were instantly best friends. By month 6 she was sleeping over almost every night & she had a drawer in my dresser & toothbrush in my bathroom. The ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù dropped pretty quickly and me being a bit more guarded took a month or so to say it back. Once my lease was up we moved in together around one year of dating. I also gave her Tiffany pearl earrings for her birthday (she didn‚Äôt seem impressed = red flag). We were that annoying couple that would always hold hands and make out at parties. We met each others parents and life only seemed like the future would get better. 

Honeymoon phase:
Living together can be a make or break for a new(ish) couple but it brought us closer together. We did everything together including gym, weekends, dinners, hikes, travel (we went to Mexico and literally just had sex, sat on the beach and drank margaritas for a week straight). I would pick her up from work pretty much every day. We always thought of each other first and often gave each other gifts or acts of service to showed we care. My wife was deeply caring and thoughtful during this period and made me feel more loved than by anyone in my life before. If you asked our friends they would say we were deeply in love. Not everything was perfect during this phase, we were generally broke and we scraped by a lot but we didn‚Äôt care. I also lost my job when the company I worked for was acquired but my boss was a terrible person and verbally abused people around the office (I definitely internalized the terrible working environment and sometimes was down on my career). I told my wife about what was going on and she was very supportive and offered to help me find a new job. (More on this later). I found a new job that was much better after a couple months, finished the CFA, and things seemed better than before. I proposed shortly after and we got married within that year. She was 26 and I was 31 then. We had a very nice wedding paid for by her parents and we honey mooned in Fiji and New Zealand. We were on cruise control and eventually I decided I would try to go to grad school for an MBA. I got discouraged taking the GMAT and wanted to give up at one point but my wife encouraged me to continue. I eventually got a good score and was accepted into an Ivy League. Right as the pandemic hit we left for the east coast. We started talking about family plans around this time. My thought was this amazing, smart, caring person would be perfect for starting a family. 

Grad school:
I went through my grad program and my wife worked remotely during the pandemic. Classes were remote as well so we spent a lot of time together. Went on walks together and adventured around when we could but we were still each other‚Äôs top priority. She got pregnant that summer and we were elated to start a family. I was doing great in my program and was making a significant amount of money investing which ultimately paid my tuition and gave us a nice lump sum for a down payment. I‚Äôm probably one of the few people to leave grad school far richer than entering grad school. When my wife was 6 months pregnant she burst into my office while I was on a zoom crying saying her dad died (either stroke or heart attack). It was the first bad thing we went through as a couple. We left for CA immediately and spent two months there. I continued classes remotely and did my best to comfort my wife every day since being pregnant on top of a parent dying was overwhelming. I also found out during this time her parents were strapped for money which was a bit surprising given they had a nice house, several nice cars, two horses, etc. We went back to the east coast and tried to get our lives back to normal as much as possible. I ended up paying off my wife‚Äôs student loans after her dad died since he had been paying them. 

Kids:
Our daughter was born that April a couple months before I was set to graduate. She was perfect but there were complications with the pregnancy where my wife lost a lot of blood. Luckily everything was fine and we went home now a family. Her mom and my mom both came out to help us the first few weeks and it was definitely a struggle, but we worked together and supported each. Our daughter had colic and would scream for extended periods. We both felt overwhelmed at times but things improved. I graduated and had several job offers in NYC but my wife wanted to move back to the west coast. However, we didn‚Äôt discuss it as most couples would but when we were in NYC looking at apartments my wife was really quiet all day and had a panic attack while I was on a phone interview. I got a call from her mom saying my wife was losing it over living in NYC. I was essentially forced at that point to abandon my job plans and back to the west coast we went. I found a remote job in NYC doing investment research but it required me to work east coast hours. (Up at 430am every day) I was pissed and slightly resentful the decision was not a discussion and my hand was forced. 

Problems emerge:
We moved back to the west coast and stayed with my parents until we could find a home to buy. We thought we would be there for 3 months and it ended up being 9 months as the housing boom was causing high competition and we were getting outbid. My wife seemed happy most days but I could soon tell she was having a very hard time 1) being new mom, 2) living with her in-laws. She would get triggered by very small stuff like my mom suggesting a way to do something for our baby or my dad asking her questions about her job. I was generally exhausted waking up at 4am and having a newborn. I tried to keep the peace but it was often like walking on eggshells around my wife and she was regularly rude to my parents who let us stay there for free, gave us some money for a down payment, and cooked for us regularly. At one point I asked her to apologize to my mom for being rude. I told my wife we would get out of there as soon as possible so we could have our space. My wife and I were having sex regularly, sneaking around like teenagers and she got pregnant again but had a miscarriage. We learned the complications from the first pregnancy caused scar tissue to develop and she had to have an operation to fix it. The doctor after the operation said we likely wouldn‚Äôt be able to have another child. We were both devastated but I told my wife one child and having her was enough for me. 

We find a house:
After months of bidding we landed a house and I basically paid for the entire down payment. We also got a BMW X5 for my wife but only had one car. I would sometimes go golf with friends on the weekends but only a couple times every few months and I would ask my wife if that was ok before (she replied yes even if she didn‚Äôt mean it). One day I get back from golf and she basically shoves our daughter into my arm, gets in the car and drives off completely emotionally overwhelmed. She comes back and says she felt stuck there because she didn‚Äôt have a car and I could tell she was having a hard time being a mom. I was ill-equipped to handle potential post pregnancy depression and could have done a better job taking on more to alleviate her stress. I go out and buy a second car so it wouldn‚Äôt happen again. There were other episodes where she would freak out after watching our daughter alone. Eventually we got in a groove where I would start work at 4am, our daughter started daycare and I would do drop off and pick up every day, and then I would cook dinner almost every day. My wife worked in the office so she was gone most days. If I asked to do anything for myself on the weekends (gym, golf, housework ) or even took too long getting coffee my wife would start getting annoyed and we would bicker about it but it wasn‚Äôt the end of the world. We were still having a good amount of sex and she got pregnant with our second child. 

Job stress:
After our second was born my wife‚Äôs company was acquired and I knew she needed to find a new job. I ended up finding her a job at an AI tech startup after researching jobs for quite a while. She had another job offer but I told her the equity at this startup could be worth a lot. She wanted to take the other offer which had a $250k cash bonus attached to it and she said the job I found was beneath her. I convince her to apply and interview, she ends up getting the job and comes into my office while I‚Äôm working telling me the company package which included $1 million in equity over 4 years. I was shocked and after being up since 4am that day didn‚Äôt react well saying what the hell am I doing working so hard then. Regardless I apologize and we go out to celebrate. We now have a full time nanny but I‚Äôm still taking on shuttling our daughter to/from school, cooking dinner almost everyday, doing most of the grocery shopping, and working full time. My wife often makes comments that I don‚Äôt take care of the kids or I‚Äôm not around enough that she feels abandoned even though I‚Äôm gone for 1-3 hrs. I eventually get so burnt out that I find a new job with better hours and 50% more pay but requires me to be in the office. Our nanny steps in to do most of everything but it requires more hours pushing our budget to the brink. We argue over how much money we can spend but eventually come to an agreement. I later find out me trying to cut nanny hours makes my wife feel unsupported even though I do more than my fair share. My parents also help several days a week while my wife‚Äôs mom lives far away. I‚Äôve given up most my hobbies at this point and struggle to even make it to the gym since I‚Äôve taken on so much. My wife‚Äôs new job is going well, it‚Äôs exciting and she gets a promotion after 6 months with a raise. I‚Äôm in my new job and things are going well. My wife often goes to work dinners and happy hours leaving me with the kids in the evening. I‚Äôm happy to support her and trust her completely. I encourage my wife to become a manager which she eventually does and gets another raise with more equity. At this point my wife is working a lot, and is visibly stressed from work and the time she is home with the kids. I take on more and more responsibilities trying to help her. Eventually she is hardly doing any house work, no cooking, no grocery shopping, no laundry, and if I ask to do anything for myself it‚Äôs often met with a bunch of friction. We still are making time for us and going on dates and having sex but I can tell she feels more distant which I chalk up to work and kid stress. She also starts to only talk about work, seems aloof, just doom scrolls her phone all the time, and it seems like she doesn‚Äôt want to socialize with friends as much. 

The incident:
One weekend my wife says she has to go into the office on a weekend since things are blowing up. I say I‚Äôll watch the kids which turns into 5 hours. Next weekend same thing happens and I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm being super supportive so my wife can excel in her job. Late afternoon I text her asking when she will be home and no answer. I text again just asking if she‚Äôll be home for dinner‚Ä¶no answer. I finely call and no answer. I look at her location and I see she is driving (in my car) and is heading home. Then oddly she stops near the train station in the next town before ours and is just sitting there for 30 minutes. I call again and no answer. She finally comes home and is acting very quiet and I say why didn‚Äôt you answer and she replies she was giving a male coworker a lift to that area. My spidey sense goes up but we have never had trust issues so I tell myself I‚Äôm over thinking. I am tired from watching the kids so I say I‚Äôm going to the sauna but when I get in my car I see her earring in the passenger seat. I immediately confront her asking what happened and she swears on our kids lives nothing. I let it go and trust her after 10 years. The next week she doesn‚Äôt come home at night until 10pm to 12am and leave 20min after she gets up. I‚Äôm completely freaked out about what‚Äôs going on and can‚Äôt sleep. Finally we sit down to talk and she starts saying some vague things about she doesn‚Äôt want sex as much as I do (3-4x a month), and some vague thing about she doesn‚Äôt want to give up on us. 

I am now playing detective and figure out through our iPad she is talking to a co-worker every day and I see her at the same house before and after work several times. When I tried to talk to her she shuts down or gaslights me that I‚Äôm the problem tracking her while I‚Äôm freaking out trying to uncover the truth. We finally have a blowup when she calls one evening saying she‚Äôll be home soon but tells me she is in a different neighborhood than her location says. It‚Äôs all downhill from here and we land in therapy where she says she was having an emotional affair. I concede that we could have been doing things better in the relationship but the sketchy behavior continues and she eventually says she wants a trial separation. I‚Äôm essentially abandoned for two months with the two kids with her coming and going sporadically. Then she lies directly to my face about where she‚Äôll be staying and sleeps at this guys house. I had hired a PI to stake the house cause I could tell she was lying and sure enough she went in at night and left in the morning. She lies several times about how she was with her female boss and other female coworker that night. I‚Äôm livid and get angry at her but don‚Äôt tell her what I know. Things keep getting worse and she keeps gaslighting me about what‚Äôs going on. 

The admission: 
Finally we go for a walk and she tells me she doesn‚Äôt want our life anymore, she got married too young, had kids too young (in her 30s), and hates our house. Mind you she made all these decisions with the exception of me proposing but I never forced her into any of it. She wants a divorce and she wants to be best friends/co-parents. She had said for months she wanted to quit her job and couldn‚Äôt do it anymore but now she loves it. She tells me other reasons like I was depressed about my job before my MBA, that I abandoned her with the kids, and put her down all the time because of two stupid comments over 11 years but it all feels like a complete stretch. We try therapy again and I put a ton of effort into reviving the relationship for our marriage and kids (foolishly) and it seems like it‚Äôs working but when I try to talk to her about the relationship she literally freaks out and says divorce again or completely shuts down. 

I‚Äôm completely heartbroken and haven‚Äôt slept for months while working full time and watching two kids. She shows no empathy or emotion during this entire time, starts spending money like a drunken sailer ($200k plus on needless crap and remodeling a bathroom) and continues to see this guy without any thought to how it affects me. She eventually starts putting down my character saying I‚Äôm not ambitious or successful even thought I‚Äôm a top 10% earner and gaslighting me that I‚Äôm the problem getting angry over the affair. She often swings from extremely happy to exhausted or shuts down. Her behavior is erratic at times and her logic and actions make no sense. She won‚Äôt get over small things that happened 5-10 years ago and brings them up to justify her actions. I‚Äôve finally got her to show up as a mom but I‚Äôm so traumatized by the experience my health has deteriorated. I know it‚Äôs over at this point and lawyers are involved but once we had kids and life got real where she wasn‚Äôt getting as much attention or validation she went outside the marriage to find it. Our problems were minuscule compared to most and the vast majority of people would say we hit the lottery in life. Everyone that knows the situation thinks she had a mental breakdown and some suggest she is a narcissist. 

What does the internet think?

He would always take it out on my mom. He now has a happy relationship with a very sweet woman and my mom is still having the same routine every day. Going to the gym, meeting up with one of the same 3 friends and getting coffee. Recently she told me she was with another friend and it would usually be two of the friends before meeting up plus the new guy friend. I‚Äôll call him ‚ÄúR‚Äù and the friends they meet up with ‚ÄúZ‚Äù and ‚ÄúS‚Äù. When she told me she met up with R it was Z making them meet for electronic reasons? (She is very good with electronics she worked with her dad‚Äôs company before, doing all the computer works)

She actually invited me which I thought was weird and had me meet him, mentioned all our common interests and just try to make me be friends with him kind of. Well these meet ups continued with R, Z, S and my mom. She really had no guy friends she would constantly meet up with so I started caring about her more. Everyday I called her when she was out the response I would get would be: ‚ÄúIm with R and the girls (Z and S) might join us later.‚Äù 

-And so I didn‚Äôt want her to be with this guy alone and I volunteered to go until her friends came.

1kfrn59,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kfrn59,Two faced goat twins [TW] + [NEW OCS YAY!!],"Hi!!! The mime finally appears again! I've been quite busy again. I'm moving up from high school and now I'll be a senior the next few months WOOHOO!! Btw my schools almost over so why not make another of my creations once more

I'll be making a tutorial soon as well so I'm working hard!

Anyways, who are these two? What is about them? Well, their name is the luchini twins. They are both born to be conjoined twins and live their lives together and will never separate themselves apart. They are both boys btw just to not be confused. They both grew up together, they studied in the same school, share the same mind and body, has the same ambition and both are medics. They help each other out during procedures or any problem with them. Just a regular life between the two honestly

About the twins separately

Laurio luchini [the left brother]

Laurio is the serious one who focuses more on his studies on human anatomy and he is a medical professional. He does not smile a lot but yaps a lot with his fancy ass words. He likes bitter foods like coffee or √©clairs if they are coffee flavoured. He also cares for his brother's health to always protect him from danger. However, laurio has this fascination of.. cutting himself hence to
the bandages in his side. Not for pleasure but for his curiosity on the human anatomy since he is studying. But he doesn't even realized its hurting him and his brother. His brother doesn't like what his doing at all btw and finds it an unhealthy habit but he does remind him not to do it again.

Lorenzo luchini [the right brother]

Lorenzo is the sleepy one who doesn't talk that often cuz he is shy or doesn't want to talk. He does talk in rare occasions if he wants to talk.

Lorenzo is also a medical professional since he studied with his brother in the same school. He has also a sweet tooth! He loves sweet desserts like baverian donuts or parfait [that's cute honestly]

And to bring this back up again, he doesn't like his brother having this habit of cutting themselves, heck, LAURIO WAS ALSO DOING THE TO LORENZO ARM AS WELL. so to prevent him from doing that, he put the sleeve down to let him know that he had enough of his brother's habit of cutting. He does tell him to stop cuz it's hurting both of them like almost all the time. But he forgives his own brother, they make mistakes sometimes but will always forgive each other cux they are brothers

Inspo I took for them

Sango from ikigusare idols [its already obvious when you see the head shape], medieval doctors on Pinterest, hermit and goatman from identity v,conjoined twins, my imaginations, and me and my twin.

9:00 AM sharp. WFH. Coffee in hand. Outlook pings. Calendar alert:
""Weekly Team Standup"" NOW

I click. I join. Camera on. Mic muted. I‚Äôm early. I feel accomplished. Im even wearing a polo shirt today (still no compromise on changing out of the soft Kmart pyjama joggers tho)

And then the attendees suddenly start joing...except‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt recognise a single soul in this meeting.

No Kelly, no Brad the grad, no Paul (who always shows up late without shame) Even Iced Coffee Macchiato isnt in the call.

Instead, I‚Äôm met with six strangers. Everyone is wearing a suit. One guy even is wearing a tie....

I freeze.

Now ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to blame fat fingers or a rogue calendar mishap, but upon checking‚Ä¶ the invite was in my diary. Properly. Someone sent this to me on purpose.

Panic doesn‚Äôt hit me all at once ‚Äî it slowly creeps in like my lagging Vodafone Wi-Fi signal.

I glance at the meeting title again. **""Risk and Compliance Weekly Check-In ‚Äì APAC""**

Bruh. I‚Äôm not in Risk. I‚Äôm not even in Compliance. I'm barely in the APAC timezone (my body is, but am I really?)

Do I leave? Apologise? Do I fake a power outage?

Before I can decide, a Sharon (who is Head of APAC and radiates competence) says,
‚ÄúThanks for joining again, everyone.‚Äù
Again?
*AGAIN?!*

I have apparently been here before. Possibly in spirit.

I lean in. I must lock in.

I plan periodically timed silent nods. I take fake notes. I raise my eyebrows and shuffle my head side to side once in what I hope looks like considerate thoughtfulness. I even unmute for exactly 3 seconds to say, ‚ÄúYeah, that makes sense.‚Äù
What makes sense? No idea. But it seemed to land well. Sharon nodded too.

Meeting wraps. 47 minutes of pretending I belonged. I slip out, unseen but forever changed.

Right after, in a casual virtual coffee with my parallel line manager, I mention the incident, fully expecting to share a laugh. ""Haha! Funny things happen to me too!""

He looks at me. Pauses. Hes confused at my mirth.

‚ÄúOh yeah, that makes sense. As part of your onboarding, your manager asked to get you added to those while he's away ‚Äî our team is a consulted stakeholder on a bunch of their initiatives.‚Äù

....nice....  

So not only did I not crash the meeting ‚Äî I was meant to be there the whole time.

Am I embarrassed? Yes.
Do I now have a strange loyalty to the Risk and Compliance team? Also yes.

They were kind. Efficient. No one spoke over each other. Sharon shared a screen with grace and confidence. Honestly‚Ä¶ 10/10 meeting.
Might join next week just to see how the Q2 initiatives are shaping up

I retract all earlier judgments.
I am not an imposter.
I am a **stakeholder.**

Brb, gotta go and ask my manager why he dropped me into the deep end. The corporate battle wages on folks, stay safe out there.

Lets get right into it! April was insane!

**April First Event**

For April fools day we had put out a statement that we would be transforming the subreddit into a news site removing all memes and only keeping up news articles (because everyone gets their news from here anyway) we also changed the header and the sub photo to reflect this

**Ai and its presence on the subreddit**

One of the most popular Ai engine got a new update where it was better at image generation, a hand full of these posts made it onto the subreddit and caused a huge debate regarding the role of ai and dank. The rules before this update were that any and all Ai creations are slop and LQC which should be removed.

However we noticed many users thought otherwise, Which is why we opened up the discussion via a [poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/formuladank/comments/1jqih7g/poll_ai_on_the_subreddit/?share_id=DJTIcdFA6kJhQmiD6rdEt&utm_content=2&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1). which ran for the entirety of the suzuka GP weekend. The results were overwhelmingly against Ai content with the ratio being around 1 : 3. We also appreciated respected content creators voicing their opinions on the matter.

At the end of the day we the stewards are the care takers of the subreddit, what the subreddit has decided is what we will honor. However we may return to this Ai debate in the future depending on circumstances.

(Formula Dank would like to make clear that ""Weird Al"" Yankovic is more than welcome on the subreddit)

**Dank Inspection on Albert Park**

At the end of last month SFV was deployed to make a dank inspection at albert park and long story short found no foul play regarding the spins. The conclusion made was that is was Sbinitto all along.

**Japanese Grand Prix**

I don't even know what to talk about with this one...  Yuki was finally put in that cursed 2nd seat as L-i-am slowson was demoted to the Visa crashapp racing balls.

A couple of teams showed up with Japanese liveries for the weekend, with the RedBull team bringing back a beautiful white livery to mark the end of their partnership with Honda.. again.

The only highlights of the free practices was the track randomly catching on fire oh and Doohan also binned it into the barriers, rookie alonso also spun.

Qualifying was also pretty uneventful aside from the McLaren's being cucked out of a track lap record, Max was in P1 and Lando in P2 followed by oscar.

The race itself was extremely uneventful however the sub has quite possibly made its contribution for the next DTS with the nickname for Norris, calling him Lawn-do Norris after deciding to do some lawn care when exiting the pit lane.

**Bahrain GP**

The 2025 Bahrain Grand Prix delivered a thrilling mix of standout moments under the Sakhir floodlights! Oscar Piastri stole the show, starting from pole and leading every single lap with ice-cold precision to secure McLaren‚Äôs first-ever Bahrain victory. His flawless drive had fans buzzing, marking his second win of the season and cementing him as a serious contender.

Lando Norris kept things dramatic, picking up a five-second penalty for a sloppy grid start‚Äîslightly out of position‚Äîbut showed his skill by charging through the field to claim P3. His recovery drive was a masterclass in determination, keeping him just ahead in the championship hunt, though Piastri‚Äôs now hot on his heels.

George Russell brought the fight for Mercedes, wrestling a misbehaving car‚Äîcomplete with tricky brakes and steering quirks‚Äîto a hard-earned P2. His ability to hold off Norris in the closing laps was pure class, even as the FIA briefly eyed a potential DRS issue (they cleared him, phew!).Lewis Hamilton gave Ferrari fans plenty to cheer about, muscling his way to P5 in his best result since joining the team. His aggressive overtakes reminded everyone of his vintage form, even if he‚Äôs still gelling with the car. Meanwhile, Max Verstappen had a rare off-day, limping to P6 after Red Bull‚Äôs pitstops dragged longer than a pit-lane coffee break, leaving him visibly frustrated.

In the midfield, Alpine‚Äôs Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon celebrated P7 and P8 like a double jackpot, while Haas got both cars in the points, with rookie Ollie Bearman nabbing P10. Sauber‚Äôs Nico Hulkenberg crossed in P13 but got hit with a disqualification after his car‚Äôs plank failed scrutineering‚Äîtough luck.

This race was welcomed change of pace after the Suzuka bore fest.

**Saudi Arabian GP**

As is the norm with this race people complained about the race before it even began. The weekend began with RB and Max having their usual domestic and Max looking for a new suitor possibly in Merc or Aston.

Fp1 saw lots of the cars scraping away at the walls in an attempt to make the track wider, In the following FP session we saw a red flag and Niko binning it when exiting the team's box....

FP3 saw lando and oscar up in front looking unbeatable, tsunoda almost binning it on the final corner, Lewis making the new Ferrari fans more depressed and Gasly drove out with the tyre blanket still on as I guess the arabian nights are cold?

Qualifying saw lando's bottling plant crash into the wall bringing out the red flag, which meant Max on poll.

As the lights went out max's pole meant fuck all as Oscar quickly took P1 which caused max to cut a corner and former lovers Tsunoda and Gasly did a dance for old time's sake and spun into the barriers causing the safety car to lead the race. Lando tried and failed to take on Lewis 2 times and finally figured it out on the 3rd try. The race would end with Oscar winning and taking the championship lead, with DOTD Max in 2nd and Charles round out the podium.

1kfrg60,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kfrg60,Promethium Coffee: First Experience,"For starters - this isn‚Äôt a real review because I haven‚Äôt opened the coffee. I generally wouldn‚Äôt make a post without trying it, but haven‚Äôt seen anything on this sub about Promethium since the initial buzz of their free pre-launch samples. 

I‚Äôm a sucker for basic marketing tactics and seeing words like ‚Äúfirst ultra light roast‚Äù and ‚Äúlimited edition‚Äù ultimately drove this purchase, as did it being right around my birthday. I actually placed my order when they were offering free samples with the purchase of their current washed gesha offering. This coffee is obviously NOT that, but the folks at Promethium generously threw a sample in my order anyway (without me asking) - a super kind gesture and a welcomed surprise. And a Panamanian gesha to boot!

Shipping was quick, and came from North Carolina, USA - I had a tracking number the next day and a moving package that next evening. It looks like they roasted a week prior (maybe ‚Äúdrops‚Äù style?) and then shipped, which doesn‚Äôt ever really bother me since the coffee is going to need to rest. 

I snapped a few photos of the super slick packaging since I haven‚Äôt seen it posted here yet. While I don‚Äôt always feel like excessive packaging is good, this feels premium without being overbearing, and befitting the price tag. Box and bag feel a lot like Dak, just in a different shape. It came with their ‚ÄúTasting Guide‚Äù - which honestly doesn‚Äôt really seem different than how other companies do tasting notes, but hey, I can respect people trying to be different. 

Time will tell on the coffee itself, but the roaster recommends resting for 45 days, so I‚Äôm going to have to be a bit patient. In the meantime, I figured I‚Äôd step out from my usual lurking and contribute something I hadn‚Äôt seen shared yet.

Outside of that, I‚Äôve got a pretty solid fashion sense, and I hit the gym regularly to stay healthy. One of my odd hobbies? I enter sweepstakes‚Äîand I actually win a lot of them.

What I‚Äôm looking for: someone genuine, ideally a fellow geek or at least geek-adjacent, to connect with, travel with, and maybe build something long-term. If you‚Äôre local, I‚Äôd love to grab a coffee and vibe in person.

Oh‚Äîand I‚Äôve been featured on the news in the area, so I guess that makes me semi internet famous?

1kfrbvt,https://imgur.com/a/8k6p27p,I saved $ Thousands by doing Teeth Whitening & Crown done in Korea.,">**TL;DR:**

* Dental work is **much cheaper in Korea** than in the US.
* 2 whitening sessions = **$200 usd**, and **each crown** costs about **$400 usd** in avg.

I live in the US, and I know a lot of people go to Mexico for dental treatments bc it‚Äôs so expensive here. Korea is pretty similar in that way bc dental work there is way more affordable. A lot of Korean Americans I know just go back to Korea to get it done instead of doing it here.

So if you‚Äôre already planning a trip to Korea for beauty treatments, I'd high suggest bundling in some dental work too. You won‚Äôt be covered under Korean dental insurance as a foreigner, but even without it, the cost is still way lower than what you‚Äôd pay in the US.

I wanted to highlight 2 dental procedures I got done in Korea.

# TEETH WHITENING

I paid \~**$200 USD** for **2 whitening sessions** done on the **same day**. Each session lasted about 15 - 20 mins. They applied a whitening gel (covered my gums as much as possible), then used a blue LED laser light during the process.

* **1st** round - felt fine, no pain.
* **2nd** round **-** felt some sharp sensitivity in a few spots.

**About the results**

* My teeth definitely looked **brighter** than before, but **not dramatically** whiter. If you're expecting instant Hollywood white, you would be disappointed. The dentist told me it'll last about 6 months \~ 1 year.
* Note that, after whitening, you must **avoid staining foods** like coffee, soy sauce soup, curry, etc. If you do, you mush rinse & brush asap, or else the the treatment won't last

# DENTAL CROWN

If you need a crown but you're only staying in Korea for a short period, I strongly recommend getting the **root canal done in your home country** (especially if you have dental coverage), and then just get the **crown done** in **Korea**.

Root canal treatments can take multiple visits over several days, so you might not be able to finish your crown in time.  But crowns are pretty straightforward once the treatment is done.

**You still need to stay in Korea for at least a week (ideally 10 days)** bc they need to:

* Take a mold of your tooth
* Send it to the lab
* Fit the final crown once it‚Äôs ready

I had my root canal done in the US (insurance covered most of it), and my dental plan also approved crown work (50%) done overseas.

# 

**Price Comparison** (Crowns in Korea)

|Type|Material|Price (USD)|Average Lifespan (years)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Zirconia Crown**|All-ceramic (ÏßÄÎ•¥ÏΩîÎãàÏïÑ)|$400‚Äì500|10-15 (can easily 15+)|
|**PFM Crown**|Porcelain fused metal|$300‚Äì400|7-15|
|**Gold Crown**|Gold|Depends on gold price ($600+)|15-20+|

For comparison, crowns in my area usually cost **$1200‚Äì$1500 USD**. I got 3 crowns done in Korea for the price of 1 in the US, and my insurance even reimbursed half the cost. So please check it out.",1,1746490883.0,KoreaSeoulBeauty,0,1.0,False

I have always brushed my teeth twice a day as I should but admittedly am not great about flossing. I never had issues with cavities as a kid, but at my last dental visit one year ago I was told I had a cavity on one of my upper teeth. I had no pain but they advised to have it filled so I did. Ever since then I have had worsening pain in that tooth that comes and goes. I am going to a new dentist next week. 

I was just looking at my teeth and noticed my bottom back teeth on both sides are covered in black dots. Are these all cavities? I don‚Äôt understand how it looks like my teeth are literally rotting. I don‚Äôt have pain in these lower teeth. Do cavities this size need a root canal, and how can I avoid having this occur in the future one I have this fixed? 

 Like I said I never go without brushing my teeth twice a day, and yet I notice that my teeth seem to yellow very easily. I had them whitened a while back but it didn‚Äôt last long. I quit coffee recently but even when I did drink coffee I always used a straw. I don‚Äôt really drink soda much at all. I eat candy rarely.

You open your phone after another soul-sapping shift, your thumbs sore, your mind frayed, and they offer you a choice, like it's somehow entertainment, like it's a game show for the end of the world:

Option A: Watch a senile empire lurch forward, its figurehead forgetting where he is, while the machinery of power grinds on without conscience.
Option B: Read about the impending mass murder of millions of civilians: men, women, and wide eyed children crushed beneath missiles, reduced to statistics before your first sip of coffee.
Option C: Gawk at the sequins and Swarovski-studded egos of the ultra-rich as they strut through at the Met Gala, dressed like gods, photographed like relics from another planet.

There is no coherence to the timeline, no moral hierarchy. Tragedy, absurdity, and vanity swirl together in one frictionless scroll.

I took medication for a couple of months but due to forces outside of my control I had to stop medication and therapy. 

I have always suspected I might have ADHD but I was very hesitant to say for certain, I didn't want to be one of those people who claim to have it but really have no symptoms whatsoever, what if I'm just lazy? I've never been particularly hyperactive and I've always done well in school. 

But the last couple weeks I've had very little caffeine whereas I used to rely on it heavily. As I've drank less caffeine I've noticed my ability to focus getting MUCH MUCH worse. I can't stop fidgeting, I struggle with skin picking on my hands and I look like I've been fighting badgers everyday, and my driving has been noticably worse because I cannot focus on driving. I've always struggled with starting school work and despite this being my literal final, worth a huge portion of my grade I've been struggling to start it. 

I was telling her about all of this today, I had been hesitant to mention it along with the caffeine because I thought she might think it was, idk stupid or presumptuous of me to assume or alude to something relating to ADHD. But she actually agreed and said since very early in our sessions she thought that I might have ADHD and that she was 95% certain that I do. I had always thought that I couldn't. Everyone with ADHD says caffeine makes them sleepy or tired but it makes me calmer and better focused but I wouldn't say it makes me sleepy really. 

But it feels really validating to have someone else say ""I think so too."" I've always been scared to seriously consider that I might because it's a lot easier to say ""well clearly I'm just lazy and a procrastinator."" It's always been a joke between me and my friends that I have it but hearing a *professional* say it and sound serious? It's like all the struggling I've done wasn't because of nothing and wasn't just me not being good enough. 

I want to take more steps and look into medication but I don't know where to even start. I don't think drinking 4 cups of coffee or 3 monsters a day is good for my heart in the long run. If it doesn't have to be like this all the time? That would be so great. I don't know what I will do from here but it's nice to have a professional see what I see.

Ever since 2022, I have been madly obsessed with a woman who ordered a soy ice chocolate. I asked if she wanted whipped cream, and to my odd delight, she said yes. Not sure why this was such a dwelling story for my memory, but I have remembered this encounter till now and I have always wondered where she went. She had brunette hair and a small suv or hatchback, that is where my memory fails me. I know it wasn‚Äôt a dream, but I can‚Äôt remember her face or smile. I don‚Äôt know why. 

For some time now there has been a woman with brunette hair coming to grab coffees. She orders a few and each time, I hope to park her in our waiting bay. Just so I can take the leisure to deliver it to her. She often forgets to order a cup of water, and when she does I often ask her simply if she would like one. Sometimes she remembers to bring her own. Sometimes she responds with a please and a thank you. The coffees are often with soy, and an extra shot. But I have never seen her order an ice chocolate. So how would I know it‚Äôs her? 

I remember one encounter, during my leisurely walk to her car, I asked if she had ever been told she had looked like a few celebrities. Mila Kunis, Angelina Jolie etc. And to this she responded with, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been told I look like a lot of people.‚Äù Her smile is still etched in my mind. It‚Äôs sly, sultry and sensual. It‚Äôs cheeky and innocent too. Perhaps just out of pity or kindness. I told her she looked a lot like Mila Kunis, not just because of her sly, sultry and sensual performance in Black Swan, but because they both shared the same chestnut hair and big eyes. She let out another smile. And told me that I was very pretty. And ever since that day, I have adored the brunette in the white car. 

Oh, this is just something cheeky. But she has a cigarette sometimes. All the more for why I‚Äôm attracted to her.

### Background

Hello! I am a 32 year old man who just ran my debut half marathon at the Orange County Half Marathon. I am obviously a much less accomplished/experienced runner than almost everyone here, but I am taking it seriously and I wanted to get folks‚Äô thoughts as I moved forward my first ever ‚ÄúA‚Äù race.

It makes sense to start with a little personal history. In May 2023, I weighed 365 pounds. I had just turned 30 and after various failed attempts at trying to lose weight since I was a preteen, had prediabetes, high blood pressure, severe sleep apnea, and a number of other problems that traditionally accompany morbid obesity. I was not having a good time. For whatever reason, this particular attempt to lose weight worked. I weighed/tracked my food, got 10k steps a day, and did a push-pull-legs weightlifting routine 3 days a week. By June 2024 I was down to 200 pounds and was doing a solid amount of aerobic work as well - 45 minutes of Zone 2 cardio every other day (incline treadmill, occasional elliptical for variety). 

That June, I went on a family vacation to Cape Cod, and was not able to find a gym close to the beach cottage that would allow me to continue working out. I was getting a little frustrated and felt a bit stir-crazy because exercise had become such a big part of my routine and identity. The second day I was down there I saw my little brother go out for a run and realized that hey‚Ä¶ I had probably lost enough weight that running wouldn‚Äôt be a total disaster for my legs, the way I had always thought it would be. I started running on the beach using a couch to 5k app. I didn‚Äôt hate it and enjoyed the gamification/progression. I ran my first 5k in 41:03 in August 2024, then set a goal to get a sub-30 minute 5k by Thanksgiving. I managed a 29:16 5k during my local Turkey Trot and decided that I had enough time to set a pretty big goal: breaking a 2 hour half marathon around my 32nd birthday in May.

### Training

This might make people a little frustrated with me but I used Runna to train for everything after my first 5k. I appreciated the extra level of support of having a pacer in my headphones, as well as the ability of the plan to adjust to my changes in pace. For this half marathon block, I had a 23 week plan, running 5 days a week, peaking at 70km/44 miles a week, with the longest workout being 24km/15 miles. I‚Äôve heard that people can find Runna to be a little too low-mileage and high-intensity. The normal distribution of workouts I was given were two easy runs, one interval workout, one tempo workout, and a long run. There were times when the long run would also be a quality session and those weeks I almost always replaced the tempo workout with an easy run of the same length. I found some of the paces that were expected on the workouts a little scary, especially the tempo sessions, but was usually able to muddle through somewhere close to the paces expected of me. 

I continued my lifting routine, but by the end of the training block had moved away from one session of legs a week to doing a slightly more runner-specific leg workout later in the day after my two weekly quality sessions. This transition was a little ad-hoc and something I could/should get more dialed in in the future. I also did cross training on days where I lifted but did not run, usually Z1/Z2 on an incline treadmill for 30-45 minutes, along with walking my dog about an hour and a half every day.

I stayed almost completely injury-free throughout, though I had a couple flare ups of patellar discomfort as well as some soleus soreness after long/tempo runs. I warmed up, stretched a lot, and did Pilates which seemed to help.

Throughout my training block, Runna estimated my eventual finishing time somewhere around 1:55. I eventually progressed to the point where I thought I stood a pretty good chance to break 2.

### Pre-race

First off, my brothers and parents came into town and made it a whole fun weekend event. My brothers both ran the half with me, my wife and my brother‚Äôs girlfriend ran the 5k day before. It was an excellent time and their support and love was invaluable as I went for this.

I have never tapered or carb-loaded before but this past week was pretty damn miserable. I did some research about whether a carb load is even necessary for a half marathon and decided something relatively modest, targeting 500g of carbs a day, would be sufficient. I am not used to eating so many carbs! I‚Äôm not on any kind of hugely restrictive diet and have been maintaining around 155 pounds for a couple months now, but the majority of my meals have a lot of protein and fiber so switching to white pasta and pretzels threw me a bit.

I don‚Äôt know if it was plain old nerves or something physiological, but I felt out of sorts as soon as I started the carb load after my final workout of the training block on Thursday morning. My resting heart rate was up, my mood was terrible, I felt strange and like something was wrong. I was definitely eating more calories with less activity than usual.

I tried to ignore it and continue to eat a decent amount of food but would love to hear some thoughts about whether this is normal or if I might be so maladapted to carbs at this point that I need to ease them back in over a longer period of time to not throw my body off. Maybe I was just eating too many calories, period. I know most people here aren‚Äôt doctors but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience.

### Race Morning + Logistics

Woke up at 4:00, drank a coffee and had some toast with powdered peanut butter and honey, as well as 24 oz of water with a packet of LMNT. I had practiced fueling long runs with slightly more than that but was still worried due to my reactions to big meals the prior week. I was hoping to be able to clear myself out before I left for the race but that was not in the cards, unfortunately. 

My brothers and I got dropped off near the starting line around 5:45 for a 6:30 start. We left a little earlier than we thought was necessary to do it but traffic was a bit of a bear, and apparently got MUCH worse after we were dropped off, according to my family. Highly recommend leaving for the race much earlier than you'd think to account for traffic, it is not properly displayed on google maps.

Race morning logistics were pretty easy. Lots of port-a-potties, easy/smooth gear check. The only thing I‚Äôd say is that it was crowded - I had hoped to have a little more room to warm up and do some strides but that was probably naive of me. I still got in my leg swings and hamstring sweeps

I ran in the New Balance SC Trainer V3, a pretty cushiony plated shoe. I've been using it for all my quality workouts for the past couple months. 

I got into my corral with about 10 minutes to go before the race, found the 2 hour pacers, and took a 6d caffeinated gel (20g carb, 75mg caffeine) 5 minutes before the start. I was a bit nervous and shaky and still didn‚Äôt feel 100% normal but I was excited to get rolling. 

### Race

One of my younger brothers started with me with the 2 hour pacers, the other went off ahead because his PR is low 1:50s on a more difficult course than this. 

As we went off, I slotted directly behind the pair of 2 hour pacers, who did a great job keeping everyone positive and calm throughout the beginning of the race. The weather was pretty much perfect, 56 F, cloudy with almost no wind. A little misty. 

About one mile into the race I began to panic. It felt like there was no way I was going to be able to maintain this pace for 13 miles. It wasn‚Äôt particularly grueling or anything, but I think it coincided with the steepest climb of the course, and the pacers chose that moment to do a modest push. I felt like something was wrong and had this animal moment of wanting to stop or slow down, but I realized if I did that my brother would also slow down with me and I didn‚Äôt want to ruin his race. So I took a gel and left foot-right footed my way through the panic until we hit the crest of a hill and began a long downhill portion. I was able to get my emotions under control and stick with the pacers. My brother had to take a bathroom break due to GI distress around mile 4 and never caught back up, finishing a touch over 2 hours, but his support got me through that first moment of panic and for that I‚Äôll be forever grateful. 

I stayed directly behind the pacers for the next few miles, feeling very good and in control. The OC half course is quite pretty, is net downhill, and has some decent support, nothing wild and raucous but you definitely see a good amount of signs and folks out there, especially near the end. I kept taking gels (one more caffeine one, and 5 of the 10 for $10 isotonic SIS ones from The Feed) around every 20 minutes, maybe a touch less, for the remainder of the race. I felt a little bit of GI discomfort when I would shoot one down, but I‚Äôve practiced with those gels in those amounts for long enough that I didn‚Äôt suffer any ill effects. I ended up at 75g of carbs an hour. I had to pee the entire time but nevertheless took water at almost every water station, though I need more practice with the cup pinch technique.

Around mile 8, I heard one of the pacers mention something to the other to the effect of ‚Äúoh jeez, we gotta pick up the pace a little bit.‚Äù I had planned on staying with the pacers up until ‚Äúthe big hill‚Äù at mile 11 and to break away at that point to finish faster if I was still feeling strong. I decided to start pushing here instead, figuring that I wanted to avoid traffic of the whole pace group pushing through the field.

As I pulled away from the 2 hour pace group, I was comfortably maintaining a heart rate around 160, which was around the middle of my Z3. Moving through the field felt motivating, and around mile 10 I started to think I was likely to break 2. My quads were burning a bit but my joints and calves and breath felt good. The hill at mile 11 looks big but didn‚Äôt actually pose a problem, I think there‚Äôs only 50 feet of actual vert to it. After cresting that, I was sure I would hit my goal. Around mile 12, I noticed my other younger brother slowing down to walk, he told me he was cramping really bad. I passed him and decided I needed to squeeze my pace down a little more in case he saw me and tried to catch up. I kept choosing new people to try and pass, and moved through the field a little more before crossing the line at 1:56:XX bib time. 

### Post-race

Volunteers loaded me up with water, Gatorade, chocolate milk, granola bars and fruit. I laid down in the grass, pounded my chocolate milk, got my gear and went to meet my family. 

Hugged my wife, had a little cry, hugged everyone else and had a little cry, took pictures, ate a big ol‚Äô breakfast. 

Looking at the data, I‚Äôm guessing I could have probably finished faster. I never hit the point of being in a lot of discomfort other than my little panic I mentioned earlier. It was much more important to me to get this race in the can and finish sub 2 than to squeeze every last drop out of my performance, but now that I have the experience, I definitely want to figure out when to push harder. My threshold has been calculated around 169 bpm, and I stayed consistently in the 155-162 range. Maybe that‚Äôs ideal and going any harder would have gassed me out. Regardless, I am incredibly proud of myself and satisfied with my race, and would not change a thing about how it went down.

The rest of the day I stayed off my feet. Today I haven‚Äôt noticed particularly bad soreness, felt maybe 125% I would after an intense workout/leg day combo. Gonna go for a longer walk after I submit this post, will update if anything changes.

### Moving forward

This is the main reason I made this post, and pretty much everything I wrote prior is prelude to it. I loved training for this race. I loved the energy of running in it. And ultimately, I love that running gives me a measurable, trainable indication of my fitness that isn‚Äôt the number I see on the scale.

I‚Äôll never be a truly talented runner ‚Äî there are just too many years of aerobic development that I‚Äôve missed out on and I‚Äôm already 32. But I‚Äôm tough and motivated and I think it‚Äôs worth setting a big scary goal that might seem as impossible as losing 210 pounds: I want to break a 3 hour marathon, and maybe even BQ after the qualifying time bumps up when I turn 35. I am curious as to what the more experienced people here would suggest I do next if I am going to be locked in on that goal. Trying hard will be its own reward even if I end up falling short.

A marathon this fall? More speed development/shorter races? Continuing with Runna, or switching to a different plan or even a ‚Äúreal‚Äù coach? The only thing I have currently planned is running a 10k 6 weeks from today.

Hello there. Taking a break from progressing things to talk about more random details on my setting. All names aren't finalized as is the norm. Hope you all enjoy!


When it comes to the Heralds of the King, I find it best to just go with the flow of whatever new mystery they open without regard for anything. Nowhere is that better exemplified then in the loose collection of trinkets agents have recovered after a Herald attack. 


What they really are, why they exist, and why they are left in the wake of these beings is unknown, as is the trend when dealing with them. What is known is that, occasionally, once the Knight or the Rook has killed whoever they were sent to kill, and cleanup begins, objects have been found at the site. 


What these objects are is random, from an ornate, beautiful war hammer to a literal styrofoam cup, the condition is variable, from fine to broken beyond recognition, but the consistant fact is that they appear to possess unnatural properties, which the reality shifting Heralds would have no need of. 


This report can not explain them all, as several of them are top secret, and several others are unidentifiable heaps of molten slang or billions of pieces of screws and bolts. The following is a quick guide to the most influential of the artifacts, for the exclusive use of members of the Abnormal Human Commission. 


-The reforger: an ornate, to handed war hammer, designed with representations of the biblical 7 days of creation. As it appears, uses of it allows the welder to turn component matter into anything, simply by hitting it. The main caveats being that already assembled objects tend to simply break as expected, that the user needs to have at least some knowledge of what they want to build works (more knowledge=faster construction) and that you can't turn matter into different materials with it. So no alchemy experiments with it.*

(*This is an official document, please refrain from jokes.)


-The health cups: Several boxes of styrofoam cups, emblazoned with a representation of the Greek medical sign, the rod and the snake, with the words 'Aesculapius: So Refreshing It's Lifesaving!'. Pouring different sodas yeald different effects, from healing from red drinks, to orange sodas giving speed boosts, or colas allowing for night vision . Fresh water in the cups will nullify the effects, and coffee and tea appear to have no corresponding ability. Cups lose power after ten drinks. 


-The artbook: a artists notepad, signed E.S. Which seems to interpret intent of the person using it, facilitating incredible drawings in record times. Apppears to have either some sort of, for lack of a better term, programming, as attempts to use it to copy other works usually result in the notepad creating works directly insulting the plagerist. Has been deemed safe enough to reveal to the general public, with its origins classified as per AHC guidelines. 


These 3 objects are emblematic of the useful finds that appear, but are far from the only ones. With appearances of unknowns occurring at a rapid and ever growing pace, more and more artifacts are discovered. And with them, the mystery thickens. Why would someone who has been able to take tank shells need a cup that restores health? Why would someone capable of bending time and space need a hammer that can build anything? Why would someone who's precense causes madness need an art book? And why would they leave them behind?

After a night of terrible decisions and so much fun, I stopped by the pharmacy next to my apartment quickly before class to grab a pill called Plan B. I ran back home took the pill and quickly tossed the box in my trash. 


As I entered the classroom it was almost hushed. As I looked around I noticed quite of few female classmates were gone. Hushed tones of drugs and failing to make the grade passed through the classroom. The more people questioned the more those wild the rumors got. We all worked nervously figuring the school was following many others and facing large funding cuts. The dean Albus said some weird remark along the lines of, ‚ÄúWe will miss our girls, but this is all for the greater good of the world.‚Äù

As more weeks passed more people went missing,  but I noted almost all were female. I had become so nervous I wasn‚Äôt sleeping and so my morning coffee routine had extended to three cups before work. It was trash day again, so I watched as the garbage man emptied my bins, sweat slicking his hair back. 


That‚Äôs when something that has never happened before occurred. He didn‚Äôt just continue on his route, he began approaching my door. Curious I cautiously opened the door. ‚ÄúGood morning Paige. Hope you are enjoying this sunny morning. Due to the powers that be, sanitation experts as myself have new guidelines to follow.‚Äù Carl said very matter of factly with a sly smile on his face.


My mind was spinning. What was he talking about? Was he unwell? Should I call the psychiatric line?


‚ÄúPaige, I‚Äôve noted and reported to the national registrar of female reproduction in the capital, and well they weren‚Äôt too happy. You see women who use plan b, birth control, and condoms are now considered ‚Äúunwanteds.‚Äù  Part of my new duties are logging women‚Äôs trash.  And now it‚Äôs also my job to take you out with the rest of your trash. One of those new responsibilities we‚Äôve been entrusted with.‚Äù


I stammered and scrambled but I was no competition for 6‚Äô5 Carl and his three minions that were hiding on the side of my house. As they threw me in the garbage truck I gagged at the scent of decay and rot.

And took the man‚Äôs order, 30 minutes later Shelby yelled at the new girl which had only been there 2 days for ‚Äúmaking coffee wrong‚Äù despite the fact the girl has NO BARISTA EXPERIENCE AT ALL, this isn‚Äôt where the bad part is yet,hang in there. After that interaction I headed home and was telling one of my close friends (that also works with us) what had happened. She had informed me that, Shelby was a 32 yro woman and that she knew better than to do that and that I should tell the manager to keep it on file incase it reoccurs, so I debated just that, after about 20 minutes of debating I texted the manager a formal written message and sent it, she then replied and asked me to come in 20 minutes early for my shift that day and I did. Once I had gotten there the manager told me ‚Äúlet me finish up this task and we can talk.‚Äù And I obliged, however she then took 1 hour and 35 minutes of walking around the restaurant and doing other ‚Äúunimportant‚Äù tasks that coworkers could‚Äôve done instead of talking to me about what had happened the previous day before. After she got done doing whatever she was doing I saw Shelby come in and the manager immediately came and took her away once she clocked in and had a chat with her, Shelby came out of the room giving me ‚Äúdaggers for eyes‚Äù and the manager had then finally called me back to have a chat about the previous day before, we got to the room I sat down in the chair and she sat down as well, she then told me something that made me honestly hate that place from the inside out, this was the moment that changed everything. She said and I quote ‚Äú Thank you for giving me such a nice, well thought out, well written formal message, and obviously you want to talk about it, so I‚Äôve talked to Shelby about what had happened and she openly admitted to putting her hands on you and is very sorry for doing so, however, how do I put this, you like to complain a lot which you really need to stop and think about others because it makes their day bad and therefore I think we should just drop this whole thing, and get back to working our regular old shifts, no hard feelings, and she told me she will apologize to you, so we will go from there. Kay?‚Äù After that I decided ‚ÄúI‚Äôm no longer going to work as hard as I was before for these people.‚Äù Because there is no way in hell you just said ‚Äúyeah she admitted to assaulting you but you complain so let‚Äôs sweep it under the rug, Kay?‚Äù EXCUSE MEEEE??? wonder why I complain sheeesh.

I lost my mobility half a year ago and just now when I finally decided to go out for a coffee I had to be dragged by two people up the stairs. Not even stairs really it was just one step of stair. 

And the day before I confessed to a girl who‚Äôs been with me the whole time through my illness and she said no. It‚Äôs my first ever confession and my first ever rejection. I am super grateful that we are still friends (seeing her tmr) and I am aware of the complexity of queer friendships but my sorrow is a river flooding. I can‚Äôt take my mind of it.  

I‚Äôve been scrolling through dating apps to find comfort and proof that I am still lovable today and apparently the day was wasted productivity wise. 

The cafe I‚Äôm sitting in has its kitchen closed just before I got there and the smoothie I ordered had ginger in it. I hate ginger in smoothies but I didn‚Äôt have the energy to check and I made a gamble and apparently I lost. 

I‚Äôm in uni and my final grades just came out. I only took one final cos my body decided to break down right before the other three. I did deferrals and I‚Äôve been deferring finals literally every semester. Things always come up. And I‚Äôm always too weak to do anything to them. 

And I see my peers in the group chat of our major so hard working and concerned about their schoolwork. I always knew I am smart and that I am still one of the smartest even in a very good uni. But my grade for the only course I took final for was below average. And I literally studied hard for it. And I just don‚Äôt know what the hell went wrong. I understood everything I learned everything I dragged myself to the lectures (the only lectures I can manage to go to in person). 

Oh and on top of that my bladder has been such a hater today it releases itself fully without permissions or even warnings. I don‚Äôt even have the energy to change my sheet. I stared at the splash and cried for a while. 

Why does everything have to suck all at once and why am I so so helpless when all these happen?? I started with stars in my eyes. ",3,1746489281.0,rant,1,1.0,False
1kfqqvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kfqqvu/im_so_sick_of_people_acting_like_they_know_my/,I'm so sick of people acting like they know my financial situation.,"Compared to other posts, I know this isn't the biggest or most serious thing, but I need to vent a bit because frankly I'm over it.

  
I'm a single mom (daughter's father passed), have developed health issues over the past few years, and recently had to reduce my work hours. Without getting into all the tedious bits, right now financially I am just making my bills. And I MEAN that.

  
I am extremely strict with money, I budget down to the cent. I'm not someone who says they don't have money and then I have 50 doordash orders in a month, I'm also not someone who says I don't have money when I do. When I say it's not in my budget, or I don't have enough money, I TRULY DO NOT. I am making 2k a month right now, and all of my BASIC BILLS AND NECESSITIES (plus 50$ to savings, which IS a necessity), comes out to exactly 2k. I do not have coffee money, I do not have donut money, I do not have ""stop in the gas station for a drink"" money. I do that, and then I'm going to be short on a bill.

Strangely, that's not my frustration. I'm working on other job options that would be kinder to my body, I'm pursuing multiple different avenues of income, as well as lowering different bills etc. My issue is when I say I don't have money...people act like they don't believe me??!?!

I've had FIVE people comment in the past WEEK acting as if I can afford something. Someone suggested that I buy something, I said no I can't it's not in the budget, and they replied with a ""it's only 20$ though?"". Yes. 20$ that's NOT IN MY BUDGET. This happened multiple other times with multiple other people. Can we just normalize people saying they don't have the money, and us just saying OKAY? I know this isn't the biggest thing, but I just can't understand why people don't accept ""I can't afford it"" at face value. I shouldn't have to re-explain ""no, I'm serious, I cannot afford this and that's okay, but when I say I can't afford it I mean I can't afford it, you don't have to sell me on it because it's just not happening"".

Does anyone else get where I'm coming from or am I just being crazy? Because when I'm already tight financially, and have to be reminded of how tight it is and justify the fact that I cannot afford something, it just wears me down more than I already am. And I don't really talk finances with people, it's not that I'm out here complaining to everyone about my situation, but if something is offered or suggested and I just say no can't do it, I seem to always get the follow up of ""BUT IT'S ONLY"".

Yeah, it's only out of my budget. Like what?",1,1746489205.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

1kfqog5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wp4TrainingPosts/comments/1kfqog5/5/,#5,"It‚Äôs race week. The race itself is on Saturday, but the whole week becomes involved, with each day playing a different role in the build up. To explain this, I‚Äôm going to break down this post by days of the week.



Monday ‚Äì

Though the race is later this week, I‚Äôm finding it easy to not think about it too much. That may just seem like I‚Äôm good at remaining calm, but really it‚Äôs a result of aa limited capacity for stress. See, on Wednesday, I have to present my Senior Honors Thesis, which feels significant because it‚Äôs the first and only time I get to publicly introduce my thesis ‚Äì which I‚Äôve been working on all semester ‚Äì¬†and potentially the only potential time to clarify anything about it. Then, next week, the thesis itself is due on Tuesday at 5pm, and I have a group presentation on¬† Wednesday. Mix in the fact that I am flying Wednesday night, likely unable to do schoolwork Friday-Sunday, and you have a considerable amount of stress. The race itself seems fairly non stressful because I‚Äôve trained for so long, of all the things going on, it feels like the thing I‚Äôm most prepared for. As such, my brain and body seem to have automatically channeled all of my stress toward the thesis as I feel unprepared for both the presentation and the submission. This is all to say that today I‚Äôm simply just doing school work.



Tuesday‚Äì

Again, today, I‚Äôm finding myself remarkably unstressed by the race. And, again, it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm feeling so relaxed, but because I‚Äôm becoming increasingly stressed about the state of my thesis, and my thesis workrate. There is little for me to share about the race today, really. The only update I have is that I‚Äôve packed my stuff (which included an unsurprisingly painstaking process of packing the bike with my roommate for an expletive-dense hour).¬†



Wednesday‚Äì

It‚Äôs travel day, folks. Tonight at 11:40pm my flight takes off from LAX to whatever the correct Houston airport code is (there are apparently two of them!... as I found out the other day). Before that, though, I have a presentation from 5-5:30pm, so I am, again, postponing the race day stress for another time.



Thursday‚Äì

Arrived in Houston, safely and soundly, before taking a long(ish) car ride to the area of the race called the Woodlands (I am unsure whether the Woodlands technically counts as part of Houston). I arrived at my hotel at 5am, a mere nine hours before my scheduled check-in, so I quickly dropped off my bag, walked through two miles of Walmart, Lowe‚Äôs, and Sephora parking lots to get to a Starbucks at which I‚Äôd spend the next two and a half hours until I worked up the courage to ask ‚Äì and, ultimately, receive ‚Äì an early check-in. Having checked into my room, I unsuccessfully attempted to nap, called my brother, then my parents, and my girlfriend. Safe to say, I felt lonely. I went to the race expo ‚Äì essentially 20 tents of tempting, overpriced fitness products ‚Äì to pick up my race bib and other goods (backpack, swim cap, timing chip, transition bags, etc.). After that, I went to a ‚ÄòWelcome Banquet‚Äù with a friend before going home, writing this, and, shortly, sleeping.¬†



Friday‚Äì

First thing I did this morning was go to the practice swim. When I got there, I put on my wetsuit, cap, and goggles, before being told I wasn‚Äôt able to enter the water without my timing chip on (for what reason? And where did it say that?). Two minutes of mental debate later (I had 45 minutes to walk back to the car, drive to the hotel, get my timing chip, and do the same coming back), I headed home to get the chip. I made it back into the water with a minute to spare before the 7:45am practice swim entrance cutoff, and had a pretty nice, slow swim. After, I rushed over to a race briefing and dropped off my bike and transition bags, during which I got stressed about the (maybe imagined) mysterious noise my bike gears were making. I eventually got back to the hotel (but not over the bike stress) and went to lunch with my sister and her boyfriend ‚Äì who came from New York to support me. The rest of the day has been pretty chill, and has been centered around trying to relax, not be on my legs too much, and make sure I have a good plan for the morning. I‚Äôm aiming to wake up 3am (I know, absolutely disgusting) and have two cups of instant oatmeal, a coffee, and lots of water, before heading over to add a couple of things to the transition bags at 5am. After doing so, I‚Äôll walk to the swim start and, well, start. And with that cliffhanger, I‚Äôll be back (hopefully) soon.

I started going to a coffee spot back in February, and a barista there and me hit it off. Nothing insane, normal coffee shop banter. Often times I would have work meetings there due to how convenient the location is, so she started to feel comfortable with me as a regular. She gave me what (what I thought) plenty of hints from what she used to do for work, to the area she lives in, and so on with literally no solicitation from me. 

She then started making fun of my very basic drink, and started offering to make more customized ones. This went on all the way through March. Every time I‚Äôd come in she would go out of her way to take
My order, and her coworkers would make sure they let her. 

Anyways going into April I was 99% convinced she liked me. As I said earlier I am oblivious - so I like to make sure I wait until I know. So normal day, I walk in with the intention of asking her out. 

She‚Äôs not there. 

Well fuck, so I order my drink and book out she comes 2 minutes later; she was in the back. 

I get pretty determined on things, so rather than waiting another time I sat and finished my drink. Once I did, I got up, with it in hand and walked up to the counter.

Now here‚Äôs where it gets pretty funny. I never noticed a ring on her hand - whelp as I was walking to the counter I did and I tripped on a lane separator. I was full send at this point, and instead of saying mission abort at the very obvious ring I blurted out my lines and she smiled at me. ‚ÄúYou seem really cool, but I‚Äôm married‚Äù 

Freeze frame, lock up, ‚Äúare you?‚Äù ‚ÄúWow‚Äù 

I said cool a couple times and left. 

Arguably the most awkward interaction in my entire life. 

TL;DR 

I crushed hard on a barista for three months without ever realizing she was married, went to asked her out, physically tripped and then completely shut down when she alerted me that she was married. ",99,1746488763.0,tifu,31,0.86,False

1kfqkwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1kfqkwt/my_experience_with_relapsing/,My experience with relapsing,"I went around 11 days without consuming caffeine and ultimately consumed again due to extreme low mood and feelings of depression. Nothing felt enjoyable, almost literally nothing. 

On Saturday, after playing soccer, I went to a coffee shop and got a coffee. The first sip wasn‚Äôt quite like other times I had quit, but I was quite tired and physically felt pretty shitty and think if I had had it first thing in the morning it would have been more pronounced. Despite this, by the time I had gotten maybe a fourth of the way through the 10 oz coffee I was starting to feel really good. I cooked a meal and felt my appetite return for the first time in what felt like since quitting. I felt really good, and just chilled a bit after eating watching some YouTube while my food settled. 

Well, maybe 30 minutes later I felt this strong sense of urgency and desire to just get shit done. I sorted through my mail that had piled up for weeks, I did mutiple loads of laundry, I cleaned my apartment, and overall just felt like I couldn‚Äôt stop. At this point, I also had this feeling of anxiety come over me that I hadn‚Äôt really felt since quitting. It was a sense of unease that really only went away if I was doing something productive. I pretty much worked for hours in a frenzy until evening. I ended up going to bed pretty late, but surprisingly took a longer than usual to fall asleep even though I had done so much that day. 

The next day, I drank a cup of coffee first thing in the morning and again starting being active. I knocked quite a few things out and around midday, had a latte as I did some writing. I got back home and felt quite relaxed. I watched YouTube again and overall was just like ‚Äúwow, maybe caffeine really doesn‚Äôt cause anxiety after all‚Äù. It was quite nice. 

To give a bit of context, I have pretty severe OCD and obessive, rumanitive thoughts and compulsions. Later in the afternoon, I end up having an intrusive thought that hits me pretty hard. I try to ignore it, but I quickly feel that sensation start to come over my body again, that difficult to describe almost sharp, metallic-y sensation that I pretty much always get in the evenings and late afternoons when I consume caffeine. That feeling only continued to grow, and I got to the point where I was quite anxious and absolutely dreading going into work the next day. The obsessive thought was just glued to my mind and would not leave. Me thinking about it not leaving just caused more anxiety. I went to bed, once again having doubts about caffeine and thinking, ‚ÄúI probably should actually quit, this feeling is very uncomfortable‚Äù. It didn‚Äôt take me all that long to fall asleep. 

I wake up in the night, which isn‚Äôt uncommon for me as I usually pee once a night, and almost instantly feel extremely awake and anxious, still ruminating on my thought from that afternoon. My alarm clock reads 3 AM. After using the bathroom, I fall back into bed. Minutes pass, I toss and I turn, trying my best to fall back asleep, wondering if I will have to drink coffee in the morning due to not being able to fall back asleep. This anxiety only grows. Hours pass. Each time I glance at the clock, it‚Äôs 30 minutes to 1 hour later, and my anxiety continues to grow as I stress about having to go to work on 4 hours of sleep (I usually like to be at around 8). Eventually, I look at my clock and it reads 5 AM. I consider messaging my boss and telling him I will be working remotely. Then, I say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and get out of bed, absolutely wired awake, before having more coffee and then going to work out. After I finish my workout, my energy starts to come down a bit and only continually goes down as I get to work and the morning progresses. I‚Äôm so anxious I can hardly stand it or being around people, but I fake it ok, though the anxiety is so bad I practically feel like I am dissociating. 

I go to get another coffee, and the coffee machine is down. Fuck. I make a separate trip to use a different coffee machine and end up with another cup, feeling like a junkie the whole time. I only end up taking a few sips though, as each sip brings more discomfort and I decide again that I am done with caffeine. About an hour or two after this, my anxiety finally starts to come down and at this point begins to get progressively lower as the day goes on, though I am still quite anxious. 

Fast forward to now, after relaxing in the sun for around an hour, and I am finally beginning to feel somewhat human again, though still extremely tired and still anxious and with a low mood. Just not dissociating and feeling out of my body anxiety anymore, and for that, I am quite thankful. 

This whole experience and every experience I‚Äôve had trying to quit virtually has me convinced that caffeine is a psyopp. I am being somewhat tongue in cheek, but it is actually absurd to me how society just looks at coffee as this completely harmless thing that isn‚Äôt a drug and has no remote possibility of having any negative drug effects. It‚Äôs just wild to me to really observe it. People drinking multiple coffees throughout the day like it is normal. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a stimulant, a drug, and a strong one. People die from caffeine overdoses. I‚Äôve never heard of that happening with weed, and of course you never here about that, but those same people that drink their 4 cups of coffee daily and still think they are not addicted will also tell you about how much of a negative drug weed is, and how important it is that they are ‚Äúsober‚Äù. What about someone that does meth or cocaine (two other alkaline based stimulants) daily? Are they an addict? The bottom line is, coffee makes people more productive, therefore creating economic growth and wealth, while something like weed typically makes people less productive and not care as much about working. Seems quite interesting to me, but hell, I guess I‚Äôm just high. 

Anyways, I‚Äôll be extremely surprised if anyonr actually makes it to the end of this novel as this post has ended up being much longer than I originally anticipated. But yeah, this shit is a drug. Anyone that says or suggest otherwise is either uneducated or too identified with their own sense of fragile ego. I‚Äôm going to try and quit again, but who really knows if I‚Äôll be successful this time around. Once that depression hits, shit gets very difficult, especially as caffeine was one of the main things that actually got me up and exercising, with that exercise being something that was quite important to me. I suppose I just need to change my perspective. I‚Äôm not sure. 

For anyone that actually got to the end of this, have you had any experiences like this or are you able to relate? Always on this see saw of quitting due to anxiety and then jumping back on again after days, weeks, or months due to a depressed and low mood. Before I relapsed, I was literally laying in bed after waking up for 20-30 minutes, which is something that I actually never did while consuming caffeine. It took me that long to just to have that desire to actually get the hell up. With coffee though, I am extremely anxious, out of bed at 5 AM every morning working out. It‚Äôs just such an extreme shift. 

I‚Äôm done now, but again curious to hear if anyone relates to all this, if anyone actually made it through it all lol. ",1,1746488719.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

# üå™Ô∏è Hyper-awareness + Earnest Irony

People would overanalyze every sentence, gesture, or outfit choice for emotional or aesthetic meaning. You‚Äôd never just *say* something ‚Äî you‚Äôd say it with layers: sincerity wrapped in irony, dipped in anxiety, and topped with an oblique pop culture reference.

# ‚ù§Ô∏è Emotional Vulnerability as Social Currency

Honesty about your feelings, no matter how messy, would be not only accepted but expected. Crying in public? Normal. Posting your 3 a.m. existential spiral thoughts on the town bulletin board? Encouraged. But only if you include a quote from Matty Healy or Virginia Woolf.

# üö≠ Morally Conflicted but Self-Aware

There‚Äôd be constant internal debates about ethical consumption, fame, parasocial relationships, and whether appreciating art from flawed people makes you complicit. Everyone would be mildly guilty all the time, and *that‚Äôs okay* ‚Äî as long as you admit it and discuss it in detail.

# üé∏ Aesthetic Maximalism Meets Political Consciousness

You‚Äôd dress like a collage of Tumblr circa 2014 and post-punk magazine covers, but talk like a sociology undergrad. Your coffee shop would also host a free Palestine fundraiser and your dating profile would list ‚Äúdeconstruction of late-stage capitalism‚Äù under hobbies.

# üí¨ Opinions = Identity

Liking the wrong album too much might get you weird looks. Being ambivalent about *Notes on a Conditional Form* could be seen as a moral failing. People would form tight cliques based on favorite eras of the band ‚Äî *I Like It When You Sleep* fans vs. *A Brief Inquiry* die-hards.

# ‚öñÔ∏è Judgmental but Self-Loathing

While you'd judge others for superficial tastes or shallow interpretations, you‚Äôd also be deeply critical of yourself for doing it. Apologies would often come pre-loaded: ‚ÄúSorry if this is pretentious, but‚Äî‚Äù

In short, the world would be a cocktail of *emotional openness, aesthetic obsession, leftist ideals, and existential dread*, with a splash of self-deprecating wit. It might be beautiful and exhausting ‚Äî like a 7-minute The 1975 track that spirals from soft synths into a spoken-word rant about climate change and heartbreak.

Tbh, I came across this subreddit while researching RedBull flavours and honestly it slaps people are here to just talk about their love for a drink. 
There's a few I haven't tried yet, I've heard a lot about the white peach on here, people seem to love it.
Anyways, here is the rating for the redbull drinks I've tried so far. 

I referred to myself as a novice in the title cos I'm not like a RedBull nerd (affectionate) like y'all so this is just the opinion of an average guy somewhere in the world. 


ü••Coco-A√ßai : 4/10. Yeah, not my thing. I'm not a huge fan of coconut anyways (Except in Pina coladas!)

üçâWatermelon : 8/10. It's great, love the taste, very watermeloney. It's like battery acid drink. It reminds me of a sour watermelon gummy, that's basically it. 

üçìApricot-Strawberry : 7/10. It's good, no specific outstanding flavour, just a good apricot strawberry drink, it doesn't taste as sweet or sour as some of the other drinks. 

ü´ê Blueberry : 7/10. good because I love blueberry. Too sweet, I feel like I'm drinking syrup lol

üåäJuneberry : 10/10. One of my favourites tbh, it reminds me of the blueberry one, but softer, less sweet, doesn't make me feel too sick. Def in top 3

üêâDragon fruit : 9/10. Just a banger drink, refreshing, tasty, nothing else to say. 

‚ùÑÔ∏è Iced Vanilla Berry: 7/10. Good taste, but too chemical-ish for me. 

üçèFig-Apple : 6/10. It's not bad, I can see why a lot of people love it, It's sweet, subtle honey aftertaste. I'm just not a fan of apple flavoured stuff, it tastes weird.

üçíWild berries: 8/10. It's good, I didn't expect it to taste like this tho. Good raspberry taste, it's refreshing. 

üçêSpiced Pear : 4/10. I knew I wouldn't like it cuz I really don't like cinnamon, especially in a drink. Gives me nausea , it's ass. seriously, cinnamon in a drink is never okay. Maybe in a coffee or hot cocoa sure.

üçëPeach-Nectarine : 7/10. Just a classic peach drink. it was good. 

üíêWoodruff-Pink grapefruit: 9/10. Honestly, pretty awesome, it's also one of my favourites. I love how soft and subtle the taste is. 

ü´üA√ßai : 5/10 Tastes good, really interesting and unique flavour, but too sweet, makes u feel a bit sick, really chemical taste.",1,1746488120.0,redbull,0,1.0,False
1kfqcyh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kfqcyh,My modest EDC,"It's quite modest compared to some of the gorgeous setups I see posted here but just wanted to share the rather humble EDC that gets me through 96.7% of life without a trip back to a toolbox and being able to handle the needs of others around me as they arise.

Left column:
 - Vehicle key (car or motorcycle, depending on the weather).
 - 6 foot hank of 550 paracord with oysterman's stopper knots on the ends.  This is probably my second most used tool of the bunch, aside from the knife pictured on the right.  My girlfriend jokingly calls it my ""pocket string"" but it helps her out as often as it helps me out, so she's learned to tolerate my affection for it.  Paired with knowledge of a few knots, I am astonished at the numbers of things that can be accomplished with a simple piece of string.
 - Victorinox Farmer.  Mainly for the saw and awl while camping and bottle opener and can opener while cooking.
 - Kent pocket comb so I don't look like a yeti after arriving somewhere on the motorcycle.

Right column:
 - Opinel no. 8 with leather sheath.  I've owned more expensive knives (it was a bit of a _thing_ for a while) but have found few that rival the slicing ability of Opinels.  Also the relatively low cost encourages me to actually use it rather than baby it.  This one is a DIY hybrid with the handle from a stainless / walnut model and the blade from a carbon / beech model.  Then softened the handle edges a bit to make it more comfortable, polished the blade to remove production grinding grooves, and finally forced a patina by immersing overnight in old, strong coffee.  I recently re-did the patina and it is still very young but it will gradually be replaced by a natural patina through use.  It is used for everything but is most often used for food prep, for which I prefer it over most commercially available kitchen knives.

Center (clockwise, starting from top-left):
 - Fitbit Charge 6.  I prefer proper watches but can't deny the usefulness of tracking health stats so I've contained the urge to ditch it for my other horological pretties (but _just barely_).
 - Victorinox Swiss Card carried inside the wallet.  Useful to have some verrry basic tools while in non-permissive environments.  I've modded this one by protecting the magnifying lens with some gorilla tape, exchanging the glass nail file (broke) for a rolled up piece of automotive sand paper (useful for filing nails or sharpening knives on the go, if necessary), and using gorilla tape to hold 6 feet of black thread and a sewing needle on the back.  The gorilla tape can be pulled off in small amounts to adhere things but has also served as a bandage in a pinch and also makes a very effective firestarter.
 - Lost Dutchman Mini-Franklin wallet.  Holds the Swiss Card mentioned above along with my license, insurance card, and HSA card on the inside along with two credit cards in the quick-access sleeve on the reverse side (not pictured).
 - POM pepper spray.
 - Keychain with the following: RovyVon Aurora A8, a few misc keys, CountyComm peanut lighter, and titanium suspension hook to keep everything from bunching up at the bottom of the pocket.

Not pictured:
 - Cell phone.  Inside the case I keep emergency cash, a few bandaids, and a small piece of notebook paper in case I need to scribble a note for someone.

The vehicle key, cell phone, and Opinel go into my left-front pocket.  Pepper spray, paracord, comb, and SAK go into the little change pocket above the right-front pocket.  Wallet and keychain go into the right-front pocket.  And Fitbit goes uhhh... onto my wrist.

Through my 30s, I‚Äôve noticed heightened sensitivity to caffeine, which I primarily ingest via coffee (often black, on an empty stomach). This is not unusual and there are a plethora of others who have documented the same phenomenon.

However, it has become almost unbearable now. I sometimes feel what I believe are depersonalization and derealization‚Ä¶ a kind of warped sense of what‚Äôs going on around me. I‚Äôve also noticed some slight vertigo whilst driving, which I‚Äôve never experienced before.

I also have OCD-type behaviours that were still there but somewhat latent for a lot of years, but which have resurfaced and become increasingly worse since the pandemic. These are 100% exacerbated by caffeine, yet I still choose to consume it.

I have quit alcohol for a couple of long stretches and am currently 9.5 months sober from it and I definitely drink more coffee because of that. 

There are no real problems in my life, but I choose to drink coffee and it makes me feel awful and catastrophise everything and is increasingly making my life more difficult than it would be without it.

I know this may all sound goofy, but most in this sub and anyone with a sensitivity will know that this is pretty serious business. I used to be able to drink coffee like water without adverse effects, but that is no longer the case. It even tastes different to me now.

I was profusely sweating pretty quick, and in most of the workouts, feeling dizzy and felt thrashed throughout the work out. My peak HR was 135 but more like 120 on average. I didn't even think about the Ritalin and coffee till I got home. While it was a new routine he had me on, I've never felt dizzy in workouts before. I've read that leg dominant workouts really are dependent on blood flow and the Ritalin def showed some adverse symptoms coupled with that coffee shot. No bueno. Any advice on how to manage your meds and working out? Was this just because I had the caffeine inadvertently before the dose?",1,1746487665.0,ADHD,7,1.0,False

1kfq594,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1kfq594/review_getting_weird_with_stone_wit/,Review: Getting Weird with Stone & Wit,"Stone & Wit is much beloved on this sub, so of course I had to check it out! This review is composed of samples purchased directly from the retailer website as well as samples from the Sunday destashes. From my ordering experience they have a quick TAT and reasonable prices. Half scents are oil only and half have an EDP option.

*Likes*: green nature scents like pine, dirt, rain, woods, musk/skin, oil, hints of salt, and gourmands like fresh bread/mall pretzel, cardamom, fig, honey, lactonics, mint

*Dislikes*: soap, rose, strong florals, jasmine, white florals, powder, patchouli, lily, oakmoss, citrus, marshmallow

**Blackberry Heartwood**: There‚Äôs almost universal love for this one on IMAM, so let‚Äôs get into it first. In the bottle it smells like apples, but on the skin, a tart juicy blackberry shows up. My husband says this is ‚Äúsoapy‚Äù but I think it walks on the safe side of soap. It‚Äôs not jammy either; just a true, ripe blackberry warming up on your skin. Simple, masterful, almost boring.¬† There‚Äôs something else in the tartness though that interests me‚Ä¶bug spray? Citronella? In the scent description ‚ÄúCitronellol‚Äù is listed as a known allergen, but nothing listed in the notes so who knows if this is the true culprit. Either way, I like it and I think it adds to the atmospheric aspect of picking blackberries at the edge of the woods. It‚Äôs a bit underwhelming for me, but I‚Äôm going to revisit this in warmer months. ***Notes:*** *Blackberries, warm greens, sandalwood, amyris* 7/10

**We Played Our Records Backwards Too Many Times**: Initial thoughts from my husband were ‚Äúcough syrup‚Äù and coffee, but for me it was of a boozy cocktail (it‚Äôs the maraschino cherry note that gets me every time). As it dried down I got more of the coffee, but in the way that a coffee shop smells like coffee, and less like you are sticking your nose into a cup of coffee. Weirdly, getting lotion vibes from this one after a while. For me it‚Äôs a bit forgettable and decidedly masculine. I feel like I‚Äôve already sniffed a number of iterations of the heavy, cherry, coffee thing and it‚Äôs never very memorable to me.¬† ***Notes:*** *Black cherry, coffee, orchids, vetiver* 5/10

**Mostly Just Peach**: ¬†Oh no, I hate this. Okay that‚Äôs a strong sentiment, but I approached this looking for a juicy realistic peach and I got nothing but bitterness. (For the record my husband described this as ‚Äúapricot‚Äù and ‚Äúpeach rings‚Äù so if that doesn‚Äôt illustrate the true variety of interpretations out there then I don‚Äôt know what does.) Nevertheless, I put it on for a wear test and it wasn‚Äôt quite as awful as I was anticipating. However,¬† it unlocked a specific memory deep in my subconscious of some office I‚Äôve been to before and definitely didn‚Äôt want to return to. Something reminiscent of industrial strength carpet cleaner. Something stale and tired and artificial. This made me sad.¬† ***Notes:***¬† *Peach, peach pit, white musks, ambroxan* 2/10

**Wandering Star**: When people would describe a scent to me as ‚Äúfuzzy‚Äù I didn‚Äôt understand it, but I do now after smelling this. It‚Äôs also the first fragrance that has made me sneeze. My body was rejecting something in this formula. In terms of smell, it‚Äôs very very sweet in the opening; recognizably pear, but overpowered but an unpleasant sweet fuzz. On the dry down it‚Äôs chalky and tart, like off-brand smarties or a powdered drink mix. The sharpness doesn‚Äôt feel natural or good here. ***Notes:*** *Pear, cashmere, iso e, guaicwood, brown sugar, white musks* 3/10

**Frith**: ¬†I was getting a little apprehensive at this point in the journey, but Frith turned it all around. In the bottle this is a delicious fruity blueberry vinegar, the kind that I would buy at the farmer‚Äôs market and use in cocktails and classy salad dressings. I LOVE vinegar, so I was not deterred in the slightest. As I was putting it on I had to suppress the bizarre urge to lick my wrist. The vinegar note turned into a sour, mouth-puckering blueberry with plenty of spicy greenery. If you were disappointed with Alkemia‚Äôs **Baccante** like I was, this might be your scent. However, if you‚Äôre looking for a jammy gourmand, go elsewhere. This had a lot of staying power on me unlike Blackberry Heartwood which was a little wishy-washy in the longevity department. I think this is the first time I‚Äôve ever vibed with a blueberry fragrance. Well done Stone & Wit! ¬†***Notes:*** *Blueberry, dandelion greens, clary sage, witch hazel, vetiver* 9/10

**Drink From the Waves**: Now this is the APPLE I‚Äôve been searching for. Or, I realized after I checked the notes, it‚Äôs actually crabapple, which explains why it‚Äôs so lovely and juicy and fresh and tart. I come from a very heavy apple-producing region and I‚Äôve been let down repeatedly by fragrances that claim to be apple but turn out to be a Yankee candle in disguise. But not here!¬† I don‚Äôt love the geranium though. My husband took a sniff and said ‚ÄúOffice Depot. The smell of the paper and the carpet‚Äù and unfortunately I can now smell that as well, which kind of spoils it a bit for me, and I think geranium is the culprit. I‚Äôm not getting much salt until the dry down and this could be much saltier IMO. I‚Äôm thinking about Office Depot and I‚Äôm conflicted now. ***Notes:*** *Crab apple, geranium, sea spray* 7/10

**Ordination**: I really like that Stone & Wit‚Äôs nose, Richard Bagley, is unafraid to play with bitter, sour, and tart notes as well as things that are weirdly fizzy/fuzzy. During the opening this was a wave of powdery rhubarb tartness, but much gentler and sweeter than other rhubarb scents (e.g. Chevalier Vert). It dried down to a sweet, tart, powdery scent with the familiar smarties vibes and that same fuzziness that popped up in a few of the other samples. Definitely not beating the Sweetart allegations. Fades pretty darn quickly. ***Notes:*** *Rhubarb, neroli, blonde wood* 5/10

**Her Skirt is Stars**: It‚Äôs giving Abuelita brand Mexican hot chocolate, and I‚Äôm here for it. It‚Äôs a gorgeous cocoa with a hint of spice. Sadly it fades within 30 minutes, but then comes back with a lovely vanilla faint note which I identified without having looked at the notes first, hooray for me! I caught absolutely 0% of the purported mezcal notes, but to be honest this was incredibly light on me, even when the oil was wet on my skin. If this was offered in an EDP I‚Äôd order it and cross my fingers for more longevity, but as it is I just don‚Äôt trust the scent to stick around long enough to be worth it. Super frustrating. **Notes**: *Chili pepper, dark chocolate, mezcal, labdanum, vanilla* 7/10

**Candelere**: My very first impression was of a warm, creamy scent, something almost chocolatey, but then it turned into a gently sweet herbal/floral mixture. I‚Äôm pretty good at picking out beeswax notes and this is very big on the beeswax front, which I love. It‚Äôs very very weak on me, but what I do smell is delicious. This smells almost exactly like an expensive herbal salve I purchased for many dollars at the local raw organic sustainable honey store. There‚Äôs something very comforting here, even if it goes a bit soapy later in the dry down. Normally not a big floral fan but it‚Äôs working for me. I wish there was ANY amount of longevity or projection, alas. ***Notes:*** *Marigolds, fireweed, honey, beeswax, sandalwood accord* 6.5/10

**Junebug**: I was scared of this one in the bottle because it smelled like straight screechy plastic. While wet it‚Äôs still screeching at me, but it‚Äôs accompanied by the scent of a delicious tropical cocktail. Once it dries down the plastic disappears (thank GOD), and there‚Äôs a lovely fruity, tart thing going on which is less pronounced than Frith. If you want beachy vibes but you don‚Äôt want salt, sunscreen, or coconut, this might be your thing. I like it but it just didn‚Äôt last on me‚Ä¶frustrating. ***Notes***: *Pineapple, berries, gin, cedar, vetiver* 7/10

**The Red Hare**: On application, this is a zingy, jammy fig with a bit of that smarties tartness that really works here. I would love to eat this on toast! It‚Äôs an incredibly intimate scent - I really have to get my nose all up in my arm to smell anything even while it‚Äôs wet. It has a‚Ä¶leathery?...drydown which I‚Äôm not crazy about but I see the vision. I wish this had stayed 100% zingy fig jam and had any ounce of projection (looking at you too **Candelere** and¬† **Her Skirt is Stars**). If this were in an EDP I‚Äôd probably give it a try but it‚Äôs only in an oil format for now, so not a great FS candidate. In so many ways this was SO close for me but not quite right.¬† ***Notes***: *Fresh ginger, fig preserves, cherry, almonds, suede* 6.5/10

If we‚Äôre being honest, I expected to have a much higher hit rate from this house than I did. I will say though that none of these were boring or generic, although a few did tend to hit that same powdery/tart note for me. This house is taking risks and doing weird stuff and I appreciate that!! Even if every scent is not for me! I will give **Candelere**, **Her Skirt is Stars, Junebug** and **Red Hare** some time to rest to see if longevity improves, and continue testing out **Drink from the Waves** and **Blackberry Heartwood**, but for now **Frith** is the only one I'm going to FS.

Also to pour out from carafe it has to be almost completely turned upside down, which of course causes spills. The water tank holds enough for 12 cups, but those cups are about 5oz. So lots of refills. Lastly, even though the Breville grinds on demand, the coffee isn't anywhere close to the rich flavor of the Spinn  regardless of how I set the grind.

In the past, events like this were drinking-heavy and major triggers, so I stayed away for a while. But with some solid sober time under my belt, I decided to give it a go‚Äîand I‚Äôm so glad I did.
I love live music but concerts were always code for ‚Äúget drunk with friends with a $14 beer in each hand.‚Äù Spoiler: I didn‚Äôt drown.

I had a plan in the week leading up. Dinner first (the food tasted amazing when you‚Äôre not two drinks deep and just eating because you need something in your stomach). Then came the rain-drenched walk to the venue, which felt oddly cinematic and cool. 

The venue was packed. Friends were drinking and we formed a circle in the common area near the merch stands . I felt a little awkward at first, but once we started cracking jokes, the anxiety went away quick. I grabbed a Heineken 0.0 (was shocked to see they had 3 types of non-alcoholic beer on display) not because I needed it, but because holding something makes you feel less like a weirdly hydrated ghost.

And the show? Incredible. I noticed everything. No pee breaks every 20 minutes, no missing my favorite song because I was in line for another drink. Just me, fully present.  I even understood the artist‚Äôs between-song ramblings for once which was one of my favorite parts of the show.

Afterwards, no bar crawl, no FOMO. Just a happy, rainy, extremely smug walk to my car. No waiting for an $80 uber in the rain, I drove myself and played more music on the way home.  I didn‚Äôt need a ride to my car the next afternoon. I Slept like a baby who didn‚Äôt make terrible decisions. Had REM sleep and some dreams. 

This morning? I woke up energized, proud, and not wondering why I had tortilla chips in my pocket. Meanwhile, some of my friends are texting me things like: ‚ÄúGreat night but I‚Äôm dying. Send electrolytes. Why didn‚Äôt I take today off work.‚Äù Im glad they still enjoyed it too, it was great memories together. Meanwhile I‚Äôm sipping a coffee and enjoying a super chill Monday morning catching up on emails. 

TL;DR: You don‚Äôt have to drink to enjoy life. You just have to show up, be present, and maybe keep a backup N/A beer in hand to ward off awkwardness if it helps you. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd be fine without it too. Will  100% go to more shows again this summer. IWNDWYT

I have the following situation that I do not know how to handle or what to do. I am currently in a relationship with a man who is 12 years older than me. We come from the same country, but he has been living in another country for a long time and it turns out that we see each other about once a month, when he comes to me, stays with me for about a week.

We met half a year ago, it was November, everything turned around pretty quickly, sex on the second date, we decided to date on the first date, rather he decided that, but I had been alone for a long time and decided that I could try, there was nothing to lose. 

At first, everything is fine with us, gifts from him, attention, long conversations and everything like that.
Here starts the history. 
And so he arrives for the new year for two weeks.
We spend time together, everything is fine. At the same time, he decides that it would be nice for him to have a tiktok, streams and all that, I think, well, OK, I didn't really understand that at that time and everything was fine. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that he was giving away virtual gifts (paying special attention to a girl, I didn't know about it at that time). I told him a couple of times that why spend so much money on it, but he said that it was all to promote a channel on which he could advertise his construction company in the future. I've come to terms with the fact that he sat in tiktok on the stream every night and went to sleep peacefully alone. 
I let go of this situation for a while and everything was fine, and he kind of stopped sitting in tiktok, or maybe not, I didn't know everything at the time.
But a couple of months ago, he decided to resume this activity again. He posted videos from streams where he gives expensive gifts to that girl and a couple more people, apparently in order to gain an audience and show that he can afford it.
I saw it, but I didn't tell him anything, I thought it was all to promote his page. But at the same time, I began to follow this girl and watch her streams, and there he continued to give her small gifts so that she would win battles with other participants (at that time he had problems with business and he could not give her expensive gifts). Then I found his comment in the comments under her video in the form of a red heart emoji, and it all started from there (it was in April when I found it all). Since then, I've become terribly suspicious and very anxious, to the point where I have to take soothing pills now. 
When I found these comments, I decided to ask him what kind of special attention this girl received, why such expensive gifts were only for her, and what kind of comments were under her video, to which he told me that it was only for tiktok and that he did not know her personally. I said okay, but it really hurt me. He kind of deleted those videos and I didn't see him on her streams anymore.
Since then, I've been paranoid about sitting in tiktok and watching those he's streaming with, it's gotten to the point where I've created several accounts and some have already been blocked. 
A month ago, when he flew to me, and one day I accidentally saw a message from a Miss contact, but I didn't tell him anything because a friend called him literally at the same moment. 
I became depressed, I'm very anxious, I can't eat anything, I started smoking and drinking coffee a lot, the food doesn't fit at all, my hands are shaking. 
So a week ago, I asked him if everything was okay between us, because we started communicating a little less, I didn't always want to talk to him, I rarely wrote to him. He said that yes, everything was fine and that no one and nothing stood between us. Then he also wrote me a message that he loves and adores me, that he is proud to have me by his side. I was pleased to hear that, but it's like I can't believe those words or trust them. 
He's also quite silent, as if he's closed in on himself, and that makes me think he's secretive.
It's possible that I'm winding myself up and worrying for nothing, but I'm so anxious and I'm so tired of this state. I'm studying at medical school and I have exams coming up, and all I can think about is whether he's cheating on me. And I'm not talking about physical infidelity (that's the only thing I'm sure of right now), but about correspondence with other women. 
And I don't think it's all coming from my insecurities, I'm pretty pretty, not stupid, but men can cheat regardless of a girl's looks or intelligence.
All kinds of thoughts come into my head. Or maybe write to him from the fake account and check it or something else. And in tiktok, I can't view the pages of the girls he streams with, because they have closed accounts and that makes me think about how to access their pages (I understand that this is already overkill and nonsense, but anxiety takes over). But it's still interesting what those with whom he can correspond look like. Maybe someone can help me and see their pages. 
So reddit, help me figure out this situation and tell me what to do, because otherwise I'm happy with this man, he's caring, patient, and I'm comfortable with him when he's around. 
Help me, otherwise I'll just go crazy.

Me (19M) and my girlfriend (26F) have been in a long-distance relationship since May 5th, 2024. Things were going well for about 11 months‚Äîwe were close, shared everything, and she was the only person I really talked to besides family and one guy friend I speak to once in a while.

But recently, I found out she added back a guy (let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄúCoffee‚Äù) in April 2025. This guy had previously caused issues between us, and she had removed him in July 2024 because of that. When I noticed he was back, I asked her about it, and she lied for over an hour, saying things like:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúOf course you think it‚Äôs Coffee. I only have one friend, right?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not Coffee, it‚Äôs William‚Äîmy friend.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúI don‚Äôt talk to Coffee, my cousin does.‚Äù

She was clearly gaslighting me, trying to make me doubt myself. When I insisted and asked her to send me his Snapchat, I checked the birthday‚Äîit matched Coffee‚Äôs exactly (October 1st). Only then did she finally admit it was Coffee.

Her excuse? She said she added him because ‚Äúwe broke up in March.‚Äù The thing is‚Äîwe never broke up. I had only told her we might not work out in the future because she has a medical condition and we may not be able to marry. She had accepted that and said she was fine with it.

What hurts more is that during our relationship, she made me remove my female friends from social media for ‚Äúboundaries,‚Äù yet she secretly added this guy back and hid it from me.

Even worse‚Äîwhen I was trying to find the truth, she told me to ‚Äúman up and call her,‚Äù as if I was being dramatic or paranoid.

Now she‚Äôs crying and asking for forgiveness. She says she was scared to lose me, that it meant nothing, and that she still loves me.

But I feel broken. I trusted her deeply. Now I‚Äôm questioning everything‚Äîhow many other things she might have lied about.

I know it‚Äôs been a year, and I still love her‚Ä¶ but I also feel like this betrayal and gaslighting were too much. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll move on‚Äîshe was the only one I opened up to.

1kfptei,https://www.reddit.com/r/forfractionals/comments/1kfptei/notes_from_my_first_fractional_open_coffee/,Notes From My First Fractional Open Coffee,"

I almost didn‚Äôt show up.

It was on my calendar all day, but I hadn‚Äôt promoted it. No RSVPs ‚Äî not that I asked for any. I figured I‚Äôd just skip it and go work in the shop instead. But I made a deal with myself: if I was going to put this thing on the website, I had to actually show up ‚Äî every single time.

So I did.

And I ended up in a really solid conversation with Brian ‚Äî a former Meta director looking to move into fractional work.

# Diverse Experience Is a Strength, Not a Detour

Brian‚Äôs path ‚Äî from thinking he‚Äôd be doing desktop publishing at a Kinko‚Äôs to teaching himself to code, becoming a Meta partner engineer, and running what felt like his own business unit ‚Äî wasn‚Äôt conventional, and that‚Äôs part of what makes him effective.

Most of us in fractional roles didn‚Äôt take a straight road here. That range of experience? That is the job. Clients don‚Äôt need someone who‚Äôs followed the rules ‚Äî they need someone who‚Äôs seen how the pieces fit across different systems, teams, and problems.

# ‚ÄúSigning Up to Do One Thing Feels Off‚Äù

That‚Äôs how Brian put it, and it stuck. Full-time roles often ask you to go deep on one slice of a problem. Fractional work flips that: you bring the context, the connective tissue, the pattern recognition across a whole mess of problems. It‚Äôs not about committing to one org forever ‚Äî it‚Äôs about creating clarity where it‚Äôs missing.

# High-Leverage Work, Not Headcount

>

Exactly. This isn‚Äôt about being embedded. It‚Äôs about being catalytic.

# Your Network Is Fuel (But It‚Äôs Not Infinite)

Brian‚Äôs already reaching out to mentors, former colleagues, even VCs ‚Äî and that‚Äôs the right move early on. But as I told him: don‚Äôt coast on your old network. You need a way to keep growing it *before* it dries up.

# The Listening Tour

I shared one of my favorite early-stage moves: the listening tour. Book time with people in your target market and ask questions ‚Äî no pitch, no slides, just a conversation. You‚Äôll spot patterns, figure out how people describe their pain, and start to see where (and if) you fit.

It‚Äôs not a new concept ‚Äî [Rochelle Moulton](https://rochellemoulton.com/why-you-might-want-to-try-a-listening-tour-and-how-to-make-it-work/) has written and spoken about it extensively, and her [podcast version](https://rochellemoulton.com/how-to-conduct-a-listening-tour/) is worth a listen too.

# It‚Äôs a Business

We touched briefly on pricing, and I‚Äôll repeat what I told Brian: Your motivation matters. Mine? I‚Äôm here to run a business. Which means the numbers have to work. Pricing isn‚Äôt about fairness. It‚Äôs about creating a structure that lets you keep doing the work.

# ‚ÄúYou Have to Do Everything All the Time‚Äù

Brian‚Äôs been close to founders, and he gets it: fractional life is a lot like running a startup. You‚Äôre constantly bouncing between building, selling, delivering, refining. And there‚Äôs no playbook. Just what works for you.

# Why I‚Äôll Keep Showing Up

One thing Brian said really stuck:

>

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm doing this. Not to pitch. Not to build a funnel. Just to talk with people doing the work ‚Äî or thinking about it ‚Äî and share what I‚Äôve seen from coaching others on the same path. Some will land clients. Some won‚Äôt. Some will realize they don‚Äôt even want to go fractional. But every one of these conversations sharpens the work ‚Äî for them, and for me.

I‚Äôll keep showing up. If you‚Äôre doing this kind of work, come join one. And if you want more focused help ‚Äî that‚Äôs what the coaching‚Äôs for.

1kfprjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/emptynosesyndrome/comments/1kfprjc/sorry_but_i_need_this/,"Sorry, but I need this","Hello everyone.

I‚Äôm very pleased to see strong people here. I‚Äôm especially impressed by how you cope with the symptoms and manage to hold on for many years ‚Äî it gives me a spark of hope. Right now, I‚Äôm in the most acute stage of awareness, that moment when life splits into ""before"" and ""after"", and I really need to share my story. I don‚Äôt like to complain, but my soul needs to speak, and I know that you ‚Äî people here ‚Äî will understand me like no one else can.

In the past, I was a very active young man. I‚Äôm 20 years old. I traveled around Europe and Asia. I had a close group of childhood friends who were like family ‚Äî we traveled every two months, laughed, soaked up freedom, and lived the thrill of youth. I had a big YouTube channel with 2 million subscribers. I was developing mobile games with a team, earning very well. I was in great physical shape, loved creativity, and easily achieved any goal I set. My life was literally a dream ‚Äî a paradise ‚Äî although at the time I didn‚Äôt realize it. Comparison is a cruel teacher.

In my teenage years, I broke my nose while boxing. It wasn‚Äôt critical, just a deviated septum and a bit of collapse during intense physical activity. I decided it would be a good idea to ""improve"" my life further: fix the shape of my nose, strengthen the nasal side wall, and get more ""health."" I found a surgeon with good aesthetic results. Back then, I thought the nose was just two holes. I had no idea how vital this organ really is. Now I realize how infantile and stupid that perspective was.

I went to another country for surgery. We approved the shape, and during consultation he said there would be turbinate cauterization ‚Äî a standard thing he does for all patients. I didn‚Äôt give it much thought. The doctor was charming, worked in multiple clinics in different countries, had a solid portfolio.

I had the operation and went home. When the splints were removed, it felt like air was going straight to my brain ‚Äî but due to swelling, I thought everything was okay. I even believed my breathing had improved.

Months passed. Swelling subsided. By the 3rd month, I started to feel that something was off. I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint it, but my quality of life began to slowly decline. I became more anxious, more depressed. I felt like I was losing my identity ‚Äî at the time I thought it was just psychological stress and the need to adjust to my new nose.

But from the 4th to 6th month things only got worse. By month 5, I had daily anxiety. The only things that helped were meditation, sports, massages, and clean eating. I started noticing my breathing had changed. It became more broken, like there was a ‚Äúfailure‚Äù in the process. For the first time, I felt this awful sense of ""artificiality.""

I stopped feeling joy from nature, the world lost its color. I became twitchy, hypersensitive. And in the 6th month (just three weeks ago), I started to seriously question what was happening. I still wasn‚Äôt terrified ‚Äî I believed anything could be fixed.

I went to several ENTs. All said the same: my nose looked great, mucosa healthy, lumen wide. But I felt the opposite ‚Äî suffocation, lack of airflow, like I couldn‚Äôt breathe at all. I assumed the issue was structural: maybe the narrowed nose could be revised surgically and fixed.

Then came a terrifying contradiction. Rhinometry and lung capacity showed normal function. Yet I felt like I was dying every breath. And then ‚Äî I discovered Empty Nose Syndrome.

I started studying. Forums, articles, videos ‚Äî everything matched my symptoms. My psyche was shattered. I learned that this can happen due to turbinate reduction. From that moment until now, I haven‚Äôt had a second of mental rest. I live in suffocation, derealization, sleep twitching, headaches, and a horrible overexcited nervous state ‚Äî like I drank four coffees and sprinted 3km.

I don‚Äôt have to explain how unbearable this is ‚Äî you know it yourselves.

I‚Äôm grateful to God for my family and friends who support me. One of them even said he'd follow me to the front lines if I go. My sleep is broken: 8 hours in total, but split into 3‚Äì5 naps. I wake up every day with existential pain ‚Äî because the perfect life I had, my joy, ambitions, social circle ‚Äî all was erased by the loss of one small structure inside the nose.

I had laser coagulation of the inferior turbinates, followed by compression, which fractured the bone. I‚Äôve lost around 40% of the inferior turbinate. From what I‚Äôve read, there‚Äôs a small chance of recovery within 6‚Äì12 months if nerve damage is involved. But if it‚Äôs volume loss ‚Äî there‚Äôs no real way back.

I deeply sympathize with everyone here. If we got our turbinates back, we would be the happiest people alive ‚Äî stronger than ever. Right now, I feel like a walking corpse. And the worst part isn‚Äôt even the pain I feel ‚Äî it‚Äôs knowing what my loved ones will go through if I hurt myself.

Even though I‚Äôm 99% sure my case is incurable, I still have a tiny spark of hope.

I know many people here face financial struggles, lack of disability support, and no insurance coverage. That this condition still isn‚Äôt in the ICD is more barbaric than what surgeons do ‚Äî it‚Äôs a crime against humanity.

But I‚Äôm lucky. I earned enough money to afford any treatment in the world. So I‚Äôm reaching out to those who have lived with this longer and know the condition well: what steps should I take now? Stem cells? Implants? PRP? Something else?

I need a protocol. I‚Äôm ready to go anywhere, pay anything, do anything. I just don‚Äôt know where to start, and I need advice.

I made a promise to myself: if God gives me a chance at remission, I‚Äôll dedicate my life to solving this condition through regenerative medicine. My entire family is made up of doctors. I want to believe I was put on this path for a reason ‚Äî to feel this pain, and then use my knowledge, resources, and skills to find a solution for all of us.

Maybe it sounds grandiose. But I‚Äôve always achieved my goals. At 18, I made my first million. I know how to build teams, how to launch projects, how to execute.

This post is a raw cry from the heart. I didn‚Äôt filter anything ‚Äî I wrote exactly what I feel. I don‚Äôt want to make anyone feel worse. I just want to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can one day go into functional remission ‚Äî and that I can save others too.

So I ask: do I still have a chance? Are there any cases like mine that have made even partial recovery?",4,1746486430.0,emptynosesyndrome,8,0.84,False

How can I know when a child only has autism, when a child only has ADHD, or when a child has both autism and ADHD? What particular behaviors I should pay more attention to?

I have been using my Galaxy Z Fold 6 with these 4 apps I cannot live without. I want to know if they work fine on the Mate XT before pulling the trigger.

\- Moonlight + Apollo for streaming my PC/gaming at 4k

\- Tailscale\*\* I use this in tandem with Moonlight/Apollo. It allows you to stream your PC from anywhere at 4k 60-120 fps. I've been playing my home PC games in coffee shops or just about anywhere.

\- Aniyomi / Tachiyomi (Mihon forks) for anime/manga streaming

\- Stremio which I use to combine all streaming apps into one

  
4k gaming with Moonlight has been a blessing, but I do not like the aspect ratio of the Fold 6 and want the Mate XT's full wide experience on the go when watching/streaming games.",1,1746486229.0,Huawei,1,1.0,False

Decided to load up on caffeine to compensate.  Got a venti blonde roast with two shots of espresso. Turns out that has around 700 mg. To make things worse, I had a small cup of coffee at school. Head has been pounding all day and anxiety is sky high. Pro tip: don't do that.",33,1746486221.0,Anxiety,12,1.0,False
