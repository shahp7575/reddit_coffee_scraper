1qcobqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qcobqw/i_woke_up_and_the_weekend_was_erased_thats_not/,I woke up and the weekend was erased. That's not the worst part. Please help.,"I’m typing this from the driver seat of my own car while stuck in a parking lot.

I am exhausted and my hands are shaking so bad the autocorrect is basically writing half of this for me.

Four weeks ago, just another tiring Thursday night, I was lying in bed scrolling my phone.

The calendar widget said Thursday.

I remember thinking,

“Two more minutes and it’s finally Friday. Thank God it’s almost Friday.”

I literally watched the clock tick over to 12:00 AM, and my phone said Monday.

Not Friday. Not Saturday. Monday.

I thought it couldn’t be true that I had blacked out for three straight days. But it was just Monday 12:01 AM. It felt like that weird sensation of losing or gaining one hour because of the daylight saving time thingy.

At first, I thought I must have gotten confused (otherwise, what else could it be?), so I ignored what happned, but now I am posting this to let you guys know that this is NOT normal.

It’s been the same every week since.

Every time my phone says Thursday and the clock hits 12:00 AM, I close my eyes and wake up to Monday.

On the second week of this madness, I finally asked Thomaz, the Brazilian guy on the same floor:

“Hey man, did I miss work last Friday? I think I might’ve been sick or something.”

He looked at me like I’d grown a second head.

“What are you talking about? What’s Friday?”

I nervously asked him again. “You know… Friday? The day after Thursday? Before Saturday?”

He just stared. Then chuckled like I was messing with him. “Friday? Is that like… Triday? Or… I don't know, Wemday? Stop making up words, man. We have a meeting in ten minutes.”

Shocking.

I tried Hillary next. Same thing.

Robert, the developer guy. Supriya. My boss. The barista in the Main Street café (we call the lobby floor area Main Strete for some reason).

None of them knew what Friday was. None of them knew Saturday. None of them knew Sunday.

They all gave me the same confused, slightly pitying look. “You okay, Matt? You’re acting really weird today.”

This can't be True. Even God rested i thougut. 

I pulled out my phone and opened the Bible app (needed to install). I remembered Genesis—God worked six days and rested on the seventh. I needed proof the weekend was supposed to exist. I scrolled to chapter 2 (I thought I at least know Genesis a little bit).

“And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested…” Yes. That’s the verse I tried to find.

But the text on my screen said something else.

“…and after the fourth day the Man continued his labor.”

I refreshed. same thing. I closed the app, reopened it. Same edited verse.

Man? Not God? And continued to labor?

I googled “Genesis 2:2” and every site said the same lie (or I am crazy): the Man never stopped working.

Ok. Then if there is no Sunday, when do you do the church mass or services (I am Catholic—if you know what that means)?

I tried searching “catholic church near me.” Nothing. No results. Not even old abandoned ones.

I asked Siri: “What day do people go to church?”

She answered: “church is not a modern English word, but it is rarely used to describe a place where people sometimes gather to share inspiring personal stories, but there is no designated building or day for that.”

I said out loud, “Church. You know, mass? Worship? Jesus?”

The barista looked up from steaming milk and said, “Jesus? Like… that Mediterranean folk story? That’s just mythology, hon. Cute, though.”

I almost dropped my coffee.

I opened my calendar app. Every week is just Monday → Tuesday → Wednesday → Thursday → Monday. No Friday. No Saturday. No Sunday. No Christmas. No Easter. No nothing.

I called my mom. She answered cheerful like always.

“Mom, do you remember weekends? Like… days off?”

She laughed. “Days off? Sweetie, everybody works. That’s how it’s always been. You feeling okay?”

I hung up and escaped my office and now I am sitting in my car in the parking ramp for twenty minutes trying not to hyperventilate.

The worst part isn’t that I lost my weekend.

The worst part isn’t that I’m the only one who remembers it ever existed.

The worst part is there is no God in this world.

I miss sleeping until late noon.

I miss “Thank God it’s Friday.”

I miss the park I used to take a stroll on during the weekends.

I keep feeling this phantom ache—like my soul is mourning something the rest of the world never had.

Today is Thursday, and I will wake up on Monday morning again.

i’m scared.

But I am not sure if God will hear my prayer in a world where there is no God in the Bible.

…what happens when the week never ends?

If you’re reading this and you remember Friday, Saturday, and Sunday—please. Please tell me I’m not alone.

Hi everybody! I have released a new version of my app **Habits** and I would love to hear your feedback.

Unlike standard launchers that just show your ""most used"" apps, Habits tries to predict what you are going to use right now based on your past behavior at this specific time and day.

**Link:** [Habits (Google PlayStore)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nick.applab.habits)

**What you get in Habits:**

* **Contextual Predictions:** The widget adapts to your routine. It serves up news apps with your morning coffee and switches to streaming or music for your Friday nights :)
* **Smart Learning:** It doesn't just count clicks; it builds a local statistical model to understand your daily routines and habits.
* **100% Privacy Focused:** No servers, no tracking. All data processing and storage happen exclusively on your device.
* **Long-Term Memory:** The app creates a historical database to improve accuracy over months (unlike the standard Android history which only lasts a few days).
* **Data Ownership:** You can export/import your usage history database, so you don't lose your personalized model when switching devices.
* **Minimalist Widget:** Designed to blend into your home screen while saving you time searching for apps.

While things like toasters or stand mixers can last decades, electric kettles (even the ""premium"" $150+ range) seem to have a lifespan of 2-3 years before mechanical or electronic failure.

From a design and engineering perspective, I’m trying to understand the specific hurdles here. Is it just cost-cutting/planned obsolescence, or are the thermal challenges really that difficult to solve?

I see three main failure points and would love your professional take on why these persist:

Vapor Isolation: Why is it so rare to see a properly sealed PCB in variable-temp kettles? It seems like steam eventually kills the base or the handle electronics in 90% of ""smart"" kettles. Is potting the electronics too expensive for this category?

Material Interfaces: The ""Water Window."" It seems like bonding plastic to metal/glass in a high-heat expansion environment is a guaranteed leak path eventually. Why is this still a standard feature rather than a solid body design?

Mechanical Fatigue: Spring-loaded lids. They feel satisfying to click, but the plastic latch mechanisms seem destined to fail under thermal cycling.

The problem: every AI headshot tool I've tried gives wildly different backgrounds and lighting for each person. One looks like they're in a corporate office, another looks like a coffee shop, and the third is in some weird blurred beige void.

What I need:

* Consistent style/lighting across all team members
* Professional but not overly formal
* Same general background vibe (doesn't need to be identical, just cohesive)
* Ideally something where I can set parameters once and apply to everyone

Has anyone dealt with this? Is there a tool that lets you lock in a specific style/environment and then generate multiple people with that same look?

I've tried the usual suspects (HeadshotPro, Aragon) but they seem optimized for individual use. Saw [Looktara ](http://looktara.com/)mentioned on reddit does that handle team consistency or is it also single-person focused?

Budget isn't a huge issue if the quality and consistency are there. Just tired of our team page looking like we hired 6 different photographers from different decades.

I am very into music and guitar. I recently made a guitar cover of Vegas Skies by The Cab and I can play Synesthesia by Mayonnaise din! Ang sound trip ko for tonight is You and I Tonight by Faber Drive. On repeat.

I love traveling. I've been to Cebu, Bangkok, Hong Kong, and hopefully ma-approve ang visa for Japan.

If you'll ask me kung anong favorite chinese food ko, sasagutin kita ng siomai.

I love movies about life, love, relationships, romcom, or anything I find interesting. Before trilogy, Her, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, 500 days of summer, 50 first dates, prisoners, dami pa.

I love romanticizing road trips, city lights. Usually hindi mo ako makakausap kasi naka-earphones ako. But don't get me wrong, I love having conversations lalo na kapag interested ako sa iyo. I ask a lot of questions pero minsan I just listen din. Depende talaga.

First three attempts completely failed, lost about $9K total between them and wasted probably 18 months of nights and weekends. Fourth attempt is working though, been running it for 16 months and currently making $6.8K monthly as the only person. First attempt was a task management app I built because I personally wanted it. Spent 5 months coding, launched it, got maybe 30 users total, zero revenue. Second was a Chrome extension for managing tabs, similar story. Third was a freelance marketplace specifically for designers, spent $3K on development, could never get enough supply or demand to make it work. Pattern was always the same, I built what I thought was cool without checking if anyone actually had that problem.



Fourth attempt started completely differently. I'm a content marketer at a SaaS company and kept hearing our sales team complain about tracking conversations across email, Slack, and LinkedIn. They'd lose context about prospects, forget what was discussed, waste time searching old messages. I asked 8 sales people at different companies if they had the same issue over coffee chats, 6 said yes and described almost identical problems. One was paying $80/month per person for a CRM they barely used just to track conversations.



Built the simplest possible version in 3 weeks, just a Chrome extension that captures conversations from different tools and organizes them by contact. Showed it to those 6 people, 3 started using it immediately. Asked if they'd pay $25/month, two said yes, one said maybe $20. Set up Stripe, got my first $45 MRR in week 4. That felt more real than anything from my previous three products. Growth was slow but steady. Posted in sales communities on Reddit and LinkedIn just helping people with conversation tracking problems, mentioned my tool when relevant. Hit $800/month by month 4, $1.9K by month 8. Started writing blog posts about sales productivity in month 6, took until month 10 before those started bringing organic signups. Now at month 16 making $6.8K with 289 paying users, working maybe 10-12 hours per week on support and small updates.



The shift wasn't learning better technical skills, it was building something people were already complaining about instead of what I thought they might need.

What DOES NOT make sense however is this rule does not apply to anyone who uses a sealed cup (I.E a stanley cup)

Now again you might say “this makes sense” HOWEVER that throws the goddamn safety argument out of the window. If the students safety were ever in question here, ALL outside food and drink would be removed, ON BOTH THE TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.

I mean surely, my starbucks coffee is the issue when we have a record high attendance issue, multiple kids smoking in the bathrooms and teachers just not giving a damn about their fucking job. 

When I brought this issue up to the principal, her only argument was: “well you’re not a teacher”

Okay you tyrannical bitch, Ill just fall asleep in all my classes, and not pay attention.

This school fucking sucks, that coffee was a nicely made coffee that would have been perfect for me to drink on and enjoy throughout my passing period. But no, thanks U.S Grant Highschool in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma,

Thank you for making me waste my hard earned coins, 

Thank you for taking away something that brought joy to this shitty day,

And thank you for being so unfair to your students.

I(28M) live in a city where rent goes up like it is competing in the Olympics, so I have been on a mission to get my spending under control. I meal prep, I bring my own coffee, I track every little purchase. It is not glamorous, but it is the only way I feel like I am not drowning.

  
This morning my landlord(40sM) emailed me about renewing my lease. Totally normal, polite message, asking if I wanted to lock in a longer term.

  
At the exact same time, my friend(29F) texted asking how I manage to not blow money on lunches and coffee runs. I decided to send her my latest budget rant, including a very detailed breakdown of my monthly costs, what I think is overpriced in my neighborhood, and my spicy opinions about landlords raising rent while doing the absolute minimum.

  
Here is the fuckup: I replied from my phone, and because both conversations were open, I sent the budget rant to my landlord. Not just numbers. I included a line about how I need “a break on rent because the building’s hallway smells like a gym sock” and that I was “one rent increase away from living off beans forever.”

  
He responded five minutes later with: “Thanks for the transparency. Let’s discuss your concerns.”

  
So now I get to sit in an awkward meeting where I basically handed him my financial diary and insulted his property maintenance in the same email. I wanted to be the responsible, financially stable adult. Instead I became the guy who accidentally negotiates rent like a grumpy accountant.

I asked the same question before my trip and saw mixed answers, so here’s what I found on the ground.

First off, spices are the obvious choice — and for good reason. Zanzibar really *is* the Spice Island. Cloves, cinnamon, vanilla, cardamom… they smell incredible, and most sellers vacuum-seal them so they’re easy to travel with. I bought mine from Stone Town and a spice farm, and the quality was way better than anything I’ve bought back home.

Second, fabrics. Kanga and Kitenge cloths are everywhere, but they’re not just “tourist stuff.” Many have Swahili sayings printed on them, which locals actually use to communicate messages. You can wear them, use them as scarves, or even frame them. Super lightweight and meaningful.

If you like art, Tingatinga paintings are everywhere in [Stone Town](https://tanzaniasafariexperience.com/stone-town-zanzibar-guide/). Bright colors, lots of animals, very East African style. They roll up easily, so they’re easy to pack. I also picked up a small wooden carving and a miniature Zanzibar door — those doors are iconic and make great home decor.

Jewelry-wise, Tanzanite is the big one. It’s only found in Tanzania. Just make sure you buy from a reputable shop and not some random stall. Maasai beadwork is also nice and affordable — bracelets, necklaces, even sandals.

Other things I liked:

* Handmade baskets and bags (great beach bags)
* Natural soaps and coconut oil (clove-infused stuff smells amazing)
* Kilimanjaro coffee beans (great gift)

Where to shop: Stone Town is the best, hands down. Darajani Market and the small side streets are way more interesting than malls. Malls are fine if you want fixed prices, but you miss the culture.

Quick tips:

* Bargaining is normal but be respectful
* Carry small cash
* Avoid buying coral or shells (bad for the environment)
* Ask where items are made — locals are happy to explain

Overall, [Zanzibar ](https://tanzaniasafariexperience.com/zanzibar/)has some of the most meaningful souvenirs I’ve ever bought. If you take your time and shop local, you’ll find things that actually remind you of the place — not just stuff that ends up in a drawer.

1qcni20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1qcni20/relationship_advice/,Relationship advice,"Hi everyone. This is a bit of a long post, so thank you if you read it all.

I’m 27F and would consider myself neurotypical. My ex-boyfriend is 28M and we broke up last Friday. We’d only been dating for about two months, and I ultimately ended things because I felt very unloved and emotionally disconnected. Since the breakup, though, I’ve been reflecting a lot and wondering if he may be neurodivergent (possibly autistic), and I’d really appreciate others’ perspectives.

He is genuinely a very kind, good person. We met when I visited the clothing store he works at, and not long after he found me on Hinge and we matched. Things started off really well — he was affectionate both in person and over text.

The first issue (for me) came about a month in. He invited me to spend Christmas with his family, but hadn’t asked me to be his girlfriend yet. That same week, we were attending a large party with all his friends, and I asked (playfully) how he’d be introducing me. When I followed up with “Will I be your girlfriend?” he seemed quite stressed and said it felt too soon. I was hurt but respected it, although I was confused — meeting family felt like a much bigger step to me than a label.

The next day, he \*did\* ask me to be his girlfriend — but very casually, while we were getting into an Uber on the way to that party. I felt blindsided and disappointed. This was the first relationship either of us had been in for a long time, and I wanted it to feel special. I had sent him lots of TikToks and Reels of “girlfriend proposals.” If you haven’t seen these, they usually involve someone asking their partner to be their girlfriend in a thoughtful or romantic way — flowers, favourite chocolates, a card or sign, etc. I sent these as hints that I’d love something similar, but I never directly asked. So when he asked me in such a nonchalant way, I was excited but also hurt.

This was one of the first times I wondered if he might be autistic — my indirect communication may have been confusing, labels may have felt overwhelming, and he may not have picked up on hints, which I now understand aren’t very neurodivergent-friendly.

As the relationship continued, his affection dropped off dramatically. Compliments and sweet or “cringey” messages stopped completely. When I asked about it, he said he found that kind of communication/affection “exhausting.” That made me wonder if he had been masking early on?

That said, he \*did\* show care in other ways: buying me practical things when I mentioned needing them, bringing me coffee on bad mornings, taking the bins out when they were full, etc. From what I’ve read, some autistic people show care more through actions than through verbal or physical affection.

He could also be very literal, and sometimes extremely honest in situations where a small white lie might be more socially expected.

Unfortunately, I interpreted many of these behaviors as emotional unavailability or lack of care. We had several conversations about my needs, and I noticed small improvements when I was very direct — but by then I think I was already too hurt. Eventually, I ended the relationship.

During the breakup, he was far more upset than I expected. I had genuinely believed he didn’t care, based on how I experienced the relationship. He shared that he struggles to open up, doesn’t always understand his own emotions, and finds emotional connection difficult. For example, I remember him telling me in the early days that he finds giving compliments very hard. Seeing how distressed he was made me realize he \*does\* care, and that there may be a deeper reason for the mismatch between us.

Since then, he’s been very emotionally shut down, barely messaging me or even close friends. He’s told me he feels overwhelmed and confused, and frustrated with himself for missing my bids and hints for openness and affection.

I’ve since done a lot of reading about autism in adult men and how it can show up in relationships, and so much of it feels familiar. I’m wondering whether gently raising this possibility with him could help him understand himself better and advocate for his needs in the future. I feel this may be a good time to raise it as he is considering starting therapy.

Before I say anything, I’d really love to hear others’ thoughts. I’m not asking anyone to diagnose him, and I know this is only my perspective. But if this feels familiar to anyone — especially autistic people or partners of autistic people — I’d really appreciate hearing your experiences.

I care about him deeply and feel awful that I may have misread him or failed to ask enough about his needs. I hope this post is respectful, and please let me know if anything comes across poorly.

\*\*TL;DR:\*\* I broke up with my boyfriend because I felt unloved, but now I’m wondering if he may be autistic and unaware, which created a major mismatch in communication and affection. Looking for perspectives and similar experiences.",1,1768397936.0,AutisticAdults,2,0.67,False

Do I have a faulty device or is this thing really a £3400 paperweight?,"How is it legal to claim a ""long-lasting battery"" that actually lasts under 2 hours? 

I came to the ProArt P16 from a MS Surface Laptop because Surface don't have a model with a GPU and I need one for video and photo work. In specs and reviews I read about the P16, the impression I had was 7-8 hours for light work, and more like 4-6 hours for intensive work. 

These days I would class 12+ hours or ""all day"" battery life as exceptionally good - but would only expect these numbers for very light usage such as web browsing, from laptops that specifically tailor to long battery. From a workstation laptop I think it's natural to assume a few good hours of work when doing something like photo or video editing.

However after testing the P16 quite extensively, on standard mode and even on whisper mode (which seriously nerfs the power down to something equivalent to a much cheaper laptop), I'm getting absolutely unusable battery life from this thing.

Today I charged up to 100%, went to a coffee shop, and did a mix of:

\- file transferring (drive heavy, not processor or GPU heavy)

\- photo culling in Adobe Lightroom (mid-level CPU focused task, not intensive at all)

\- web browsing, mainly emails, with LR open in the background but not doing any tasks.

  
I sat down at 100% at 11:16am. By 11:34 I was on 79%, with 1:46 remaining.

After 1hr 20 mins, about half of which on battery saver and whisper mode, I was down to 9% (""13 mins remaining""). Then 5 mins later it died.

  
I am so disappointed that a £3400 laptop can barely last 90 mins, even using power saver and minimum performance.

a bunch of things ive been searching up keep taking me to reddit posts where people with adhd seem to struggle with, such as when i need to do something, and i do want to, but cant make myself actually do the thing. this is especially bad with studying.

my inability to focus is also getting worse. i used to fall asleep during high school classes i consider “boring” like business and economics, but now im in college been struggling to stay awake in any of my classes at all. for the first year  i was fine, but as the semesters dragged on, i cant focus on the lectures for more than 20 minutes at a time before i start dozing off against my will. its making me so anxious because i cant handle the thought of failing my exams. ive tried getting a full night of sleep, coffee (gave me jitters) , having breakfasts, washing my face/walking when i get tired but it just doesnt work. but the moment i stop trying to pay attention, i suddenly dont feel tired anymore.

this is especially distressing because i failed my last semester from being unable to focus in class.and having to relearn everything on my own.

i do also experience bouts of hyperfocus to the point of forgetting to drink or eat, and struggle with keeping habits, but these have not bothered me as much as the failure.

if it wasnt obvious, yes i was a “former gifted kid”.

———

ive been looking into my options and since im still a student, im considering taking the public route as private hospitals are expensive. 

however, im not sure how to go about the process. ive read that i would have to go to a klinik kesihatan and then a government hospital after that. 

im worried that ill just be given whatever available slot they have and itll clash with my classes.

im also unsure about whether they can communicate in english as my bahasa melayu is very poor. (sorry as well for the lack of proper grammar.)

ive checked some reviews for the kliniks near me, and they don’t seem very promising.

does anyone know of any low cost options in selangor?

my end goal is to hopefully get medicated so i can actually stay focused in class and listen to my lectures without being put to sleep. im afraid that once i start working, ill start falling asleep at my desk due to boredom as well.",1,1768397713.0,myhappypill,0,1.0,False

Anyways I wanted to see how yall are coping with the fact that saturn and Neptune are leaving our sign after a few good or bad years. 3 and 15 years respectfully. Ive been getting into transits quite recently as I quite really didn’t understand what they represent and how they worked when I started getting into astrology a few years back. Anyways this Saturn transit has lowkey made me feel like I went through my Saturn return and I’m barely I mean already am  about to turn 25 next month. These past three years have been mentally chaotic to say the least. Retrospectively, these transits have not been nice to me at all but I have learned ALOT about myself that I’m thankful to carry with me now that its nearing its end. Personally these two transits have been going through my 3rd house and it’s probably one of the worst transits to go through in my opinion. It just fucked with me mentally, emotionally, physically etc. Not to mention I’m still in fucking college and having these going on rn did not help me at all. Probably the worst time to happen but hey I can’t completely blame the planets for everything. I just hope I can regain some sense of mental clarity afterwards since I do remember being somewhat of a scholar before 2011 ( before like the 5th grade lol) then abruptly being kinda dumb/ struggling in school afterwards.

Especially with Neptune finally moving away into my fourth after 15 long and arduous years. I am also kinda nervous to see how it affects my creativity since I kinda rely on that a lot, and this transit was said to boost it I think idk… Thankfully I got strong placements for that.  Anyways how is it going for yall. what houses did they affect and how did it affect you. I think regardless having saturn go through Pisces really tested us these past 3 years idk. The Neptune transit has taught me a lot about myself in a way that it shaped how I perceive myself and who I am now and probably will forever.   
 I just gotta wait and see how they fare in my 4th house now.",4,1768397711.0,piscesastrology,2,1.0,False

The ad said $650 a month. Utilities included. That's what brought me to 1847 Oleander Drive on a Tuesday afternoon in March.

The house sat at the end of a cul-de-sac in a neighborhood where the lawns were green and the mailboxes matched. A plastic Big Wheel lay overturned in the driveway two houses down. Somewhere, a dog barked twice and stopped. A woman was planting marigolds in her front yard three doors up. She waved at me when I parked. I waved back.

The man who answered the door was maybe fifty. Gray polo shirt tucked into khaki Dockers. New Balance sneakers. The kind of face you'd forget before you reached your car.

""Sarah?"" He smiled. The smile reached his eyes. ""I'm Glen. Come on in.""

The living room smelled like Febreze and something under it. Faint. Metallic. I told myself it was old pennies in a jar somewhere. A bowl of Werther's Originals sat on the coffee table next to a TV Guide from 2019. Family photos on the mantle. A woman with gray-blonde hair holding a cat. The same woman at a beach somewhere. The same woman with Glen, both of them younger, standing in front of this house with a SOLD sign.

""My wife,"" Glen said. ""Passed three years ago. Cancer.""

""I'm sorry.""

""She loved this house."" He touched one of the frames. Adjusted it slightly. ""The unit was her idea. Extra income for retirement. She was practical that way.""

I nodded. The house felt lived in. Magazines on the side table. A cardigan draped over a chair. Reading glasses next to a crossword puzzle, half finished. Normal.

""The unit's through the kitchen,"" Glen said. ""Down in the basement. I know, I know. Basement apartment. But it's fully finished. Own entrance around back. You'll see.""

I followed him through the kitchen. There was a notepad by the phone. A cup of pens. A calendar on the fridge with dentist appointments and ""recycling"" written on alternating Thursdays. A single coffee mug sat by the Keurig.

The basement door was in the hallway. White. Six panel. A sliding bolt lock mounted on the outside, four inches above the knob.

I stopped walking.

""Security,"" Glen said, following my eyes. ""For when I travel. Keeps the main house locked off from the unit. You'll have your own deadbolt on the inside, and the outside entrance has a separate lock. Totally private.""

He said it the way you'd explain where the recycling goes.

""When do you travel?""

""Once a month or so. I consult for an engineering firm in Portland. Usually just a few days.""

He opened the door. The stairs dropped down into cool air that smelled like concrete. And something else. Bleach, maybe. Or cleaning product.

Glen went down first. I heard his sneakers on each step. The light clicked on below.

""Come see,"" he called up. ""It's nicer than it sounds.""

I told myself the bolt was normal. Security. He traveled for work. He was a widower in his fifties with family photos and dentist appointments. The woman three doors up had waved. The Big Wheel was still lying in that driveway. This was a neighborhood.

I went down.

The basement was one room. Maybe four hundred square feet. A futon against one wall. A mini fridge. A microwave on a small table. A bathroom with no door, just a toilet and a standup shower behind a plastic curtain covered in cartoon fish. SpongeBob. Patrick. Squidward.

No windows.

""The outside entrance is through there."" Glen pointed to a door on the far wall. Metal. A deadbolt. ""Opens to the backyard. Totally separate from the main house. You'd never have to see me if you didn't want to.""

I looked at the futon. There was a stain on one cushion. Brown. Old. The size of a dinner plate.

""Previous tenant,"" Glen said. ""Spilled coffee. I've tried everything. Even called Stanley Steemer. Some stains just set, you know?""

I nodded. The stain was the wrong color for coffee. But stains age. They oxidize. Things look different after a while.

""How long was she here? The previous tenant?""

""About eight months. She moved in June, left in January. Job transfer."" He smiled. ""I've had good luck with tenants. Quiet people. Respectful.""

I looked at the bathroom. The shower curtain was pulled closed. Behind the plastic, something dripped. A slow rhythm.

Drip.

Drip.

""Faucet needs a new washer,"" Glen said. ""I've got the part upstairs. Keep forgetting to install it.""

I walked toward the bathroom. I don't know why. The cartoon fish were grinning at me. Fourteen fish. I counted them.

""The water pressure's fine,"" Glen said behind me. ""Just that drip. I'll fix it before you move in.""

I was three feet from the curtain. The dripping was louder here. The bleach smell was stronger too. And under it, something else. Something organic. Like a refrigerator when you've been on vacation too long and the power went out.

""Is there a drain issue?"" I asked.

""Excuse me?""

""The smell.""

Glen walked over. He stood next to me. He sniffed the air.

""I don't smell anything,"" he said. ""Maybe the P-trap needs water. Sometimes if a shower doesn't get used for a while, the trap dries out. Sewer gas comes up."" He reached past me and turned on the bathroom sink. Water ran for a few seconds. He turned it off. ""That should help.""

I looked at the floor. Gray paint over concrete. Clean except for one corner near the shower. A thin line of something dark had seeped from under the curtain. Like someone had mopped but missed a spot.

""What's that?""

Glen looked down. ""Huh. Didn't see that. Probably rust from the drain."" He grabbed a paper towel from a roll by the sink, wet it, and wiped up the line. He showed me the paper towel. It was brown. ""See? Rust. These old pipes.""

He threw the paper towel in a small trash can. He washed his hands. He dried them on his khakis.

""So,"" he said. ""What do you think?""

I thought about the bolt on the outside of the door. I thought about the stain on the futon. I thought about the dripping and the smell and the line of brown on the concrete. I thought about every true crime podcast I'd ever half-listened to while doing laundry.

I also thought about $650 a month in a city where studios started at $1,200. I thought about the woman planting marigolds. I thought about the family photos and the crossword puzzle and the dentist appointments on the fridge.

""Can I see the outside entrance?""

""Of course.""

Glen walked to the metal door. He unlocked the deadbolt. He opened it.

Sunlight.

A backyard with a wooden fence. A bird feeder. A small patio with two plastic chairs. The back of the neighbor's house was visible over the fence. Someone was grilling. I could smell charcoal.

""See?"" Glen said. ""Totally private. You'd come and go through here. I'd never even know you were home.""

I stepped outside. The grass needed mowing. There was a garden hose coiled by the fence. A pair of muddy gloves on one of the plastic chairs. Normal. All of it normal.

""I'll think about it,"" I said.

""Take your time."" Glen smiled. He was backlit by the basement's fluorescent light. ""I'm not in a rush. I'd rather find the right person than fill it fast. You know?""

I walked around the side of the house to my car. The woman three doors up was still working on her marigolds. She looked up. She smiled at me. I smiled back.

I got in my car. I drove away.

---

I went back three days later.

$650 a month. The number kept repeating in my head. I'd looked at four other places. A room in a house with six other tenants and one bathroom. A converted garage with no heat. A ""cozy studio"" that was actually a closet with a hot plate. A place that wanted first, last, and security up front. $3,600 before I could move a single box.

$650. Utilities included.

I told myself I'd been paranoid. Watched too many crime shows. Jumped at shadows. The bolt was for security. The stain was coffee. The smell was the P-trap. The rust was rust.

I told my friend Megan I was going back for a second look.

""Text me when you get there,"" she said. ""And when you leave.""

""It's fine. It's a normal house.""

""Just text me.""

I texted her when I parked. 1847 Oleander. Here.

Glen answered the door in the same gray polo. The same khakis. The same New Balance sneakers.

""Sarah. Good to see you again.""

""I wanted another look. If that's okay.""

""Of course. Come in.""

The house was the same. Werther's Originals. TV Guide. Family photos. Crossword puzzle, a few more squares filled in. The coffee mug was in a different spot by the Keurig. There was a plate in the sink now. A fork.

We went down to the basement.

The futon was the same. The stain was the same. The shower curtain was the same. Fourteen cartoon fish.

But the dripping had stopped.

""Fixed the washer,"" Glen said. ""Finally got around to it.""

I walked to the bathroom. The smell was different. Lilac now. Air freshener. I looked at the floor. The corner by the shower was clean. No brown line.

""I mopped,"" Glen said. ""Figured if you were coming back, I should make an effort.""

I stood there. The shower curtain hung still. The cartoon fish smiled at me. Patrick had his arms raised like he was celebrating something.

""Can I see inside?""

""The shower?""

""Yes.""

Glen looked at me. His expression didn't change. He didn't ask why.

""Sure,"" he said. He walked over and pulled the curtain back.

A white tub. A chrome faucet. A bar of Irish Spring soap in a dish. A bottle of Suave shampoo. The drain had a rubber stopper in it. No rust. No stain. No anything.

""I told you,"" Glen said. ""I cleaned.""

I looked at the tub. I looked at the drain. I looked at Glen.

""I'll take it,"" I said.

---

I moved in on a Saturday.

Glen helped me carry boxes. He made small talk about the neighborhood. He told me which day the garbage truck came. He told me the WiFi password was ""Oleander47"" and that I should help myself to anything in the garden. Tomatoes would be coming in by July.

I set up the futon with my own sheets. I put my clothes in the closet. I stocked the mini fridge with yogurt and Diet Coke and string cheese.

The first night, I lay in the dark and listened to the house above me. Glen's footsteps. The creak of his weight on old floorboards. Water running. A toilet flushing. Then nothing.

I tried to sleep.

The futon smelled like my sheets. Fabric softener. Lavender. But underneath, if I pressed my face into the cushion, there was something else. Something the previous tenant had left behind. Something that didn't wash out.

I told myself it was nothing.

---

The second week, I noticed the outside door was stuck.

Not locked. The deadbolt turned fine. But the door wouldn't open. Like the frame had swelled, or something was blocking it.

I mentioned it to Glen when I saw him in the driveway.

""Humidity,"" he said. ""These old houses. I'll take a look.""

He didn't take a look.

---

The third week, I noticed the bolt on the basement door.

I was coming up the stairs to use the main entrance. The inside one, through his house. The outside door was still stuck. I'd stopped trying it.

The bolt was engaged.

I stood on the stairs looking at the white door. The white door with the bolt on the outside. The bolt I couldn't reach from where I was standing.

I knocked.

Footsteps above me. The bolt slid back. The door opened.

""Sorry,"" Glen said. He was holding a spatula. Eggs. I could smell eggs. ""Force of habit. I'm so used to locking up when I'm cooking.""

""It's okay.""

""I'll try to remember. Now that you're here.""

He smiled. The smile reached his eyes.

I went out through his kitchen. Past the notepad. Past the pens. Past the coffee mug and the family photos and the bowl of Werther's Originals. The woman in the pictures watched me from the mantle. Gray-blonde hair. Same smile as Glen.

I wondered what she died of. I wondered if it was really cancer.

I told myself to stop. I told myself I was being crazy. I told myself the door was stuck because of humidity and the bolt was habit and the smell in the futon was nothing and the stain was coffee and the rust was rust.

I went to work. I came home. I ate string cheese and watched Netflix on my laptop with my headphones in. Above me, Glen's footsteps moved through the house. Kitchen. Living room. Bathroom. Bedroom. A rhythm. Predictable. Like a clock.

---

The fourth week, my phone stopped getting signal in the basement.

Full bars in the backyard. Full bars in the driveway. Nothing downstairs. Not even one bar. Just the little ""No Service"" where the carrier name should be.

""Old houses,"" Glen said when I asked. ""The foundation's thick. Concrete. Blocks the signal.""

""It worked before.""

""Did it?""

I thought about it. I tried to remember checking my phone downstairs. Texting Megan. Scrolling Instagram. I couldn't remember. Maybe I'd always gone outside.

""I can get you a WiFi booster,"" Glen said. ""For the calling. It plugs into the router upstairs. Should help.""

""That would be great.""

He never got the booster.

---

The fifth week, I found the notebook.

I was looking for something in the closet. A box I hadn't unpacked. The closet was deeper than I'd thought. There was a space in the back, behind my hanging clothes, where the wall met the foundation.

The notebook was on the floor. Wedged into the corner like someone had hidden it there.

Composition book. Black and white marble cover. The kind you'd use in school.

I opened it.

The handwriting was small. Cramped. Female, I thought, though I don't know why I thought that.

*Day 1. He locked the door. I don't understand.*

*Day 3. He says I can leave when I pay what I owe. I don't know what I owe.*

*Day 5. The outside door doesn't open. He says it's humidity.*

*Day 8. He takes things. Small things. He says I won't miss them.*

*Day 12. I found the drain. Under the shower. It comes up. There's a space under there.*

*Day 15. I can hear her down there. The one before me. I don't think she's alive but I can hear her.*

The notebook went on. The handwriting got worse. Shakier. The entries got shorter.

*Day 23. He showed me the toolbox.*

*Day 24. He used the pliers.*

*Day 31. My name is Rachel. My name is Rachel. My name is Rachel.*

The last entry was just one line.

*Day 40. He's coming.*

I stood in the closet holding the notebook. My hands weren't shaking. That's the strange thing. My hands were completely steady.

I walked to the basement stairs. I walked up. I tried the door.

The bolt was engaged.

I knocked.

Nothing.

I knocked harder.

""Glen?""

Above me, footsteps. Slow. Unhurried. The footsteps stopped at the door.

""Glen, I need to come up.""

""Not right now, Sarah.""

His voice was the same. Friendly. Conversational.

""The door's locked.""

""I know.""

""Glen, I need to leave.""

""No,"" he said. ""I don't think you do.""

I heard him walk away. The footsteps moved through the kitchen. Living room. Bathroom. The rhythm. Predictable. Like a clock.

---

I'm writing this in the notebook. After Rachel's entry. After Day 40. There were blank pages in the back.

The outside door doesn't open. I've tried it every day. It's not stuck. There's something on the other side. A padlock, maybe. Something.

My phone has no signal. It's been nineteen days.

Glen comes down three times a day. Morning. Noon. Night. He brings food on a plastic tray. Scrambled eggs. A ham sandwich. Spaghetti with meat sauce. He's a good cook. He told me so.

""My wife always loved my cooking,"" he said. ""She said I could have been a chef.""

He says things like that. Normal things. Then he sits on the futon and asks me about my day. What I've been thinking about. What I'm reading. He brings me books from upstairs. Paperback thrillers. Crossword puzzles. He says he doesn't want me to get bored.

He's kind to me. That's the part I can't explain. He's kind in a way that makes everything else worse.

I found the drain. The one Rachel mentioned. Under the shower. The grate comes up if you pull hard enough. There's a crawlspace down there. Dirt floor. Three feet of clearance. It smells like the thing the Febreze was trying to cover.

I didn't go down. I don't want to know what's down there.

Yesterday Glen asked me to help him with something. He was carrying a rolled-up rug down the stairs. Heavy. He asked me to hold the bottom end.

I held it. I felt the weight inside.

We put it in the crawlspace.

""Thank you,"" he said. ""I appreciate your help.""

He made spaghetti that night. Extra garlic bread. Like a reward.

---

It's been thirty-two days.

The notebook is almost full. I'm writing smaller now. I want it to last.

The woman who was planting marigolds. Her name was Diane. Glen mentioned her yesterday. He said she moved. Her house is for sale.

I think about her waving at me that first day. I think about how she smiled. I think about whether she's in the crawlspace now, under the shower, in the dark.

I think about my friend Megan. I think about the text I sent her. 1847 Oleander. Here.

She knew the address. She has the address. Someone will come. Someone will find this notebook.

But the thing I can't stop thinking about. The thing that keeps me awake at night while Glen's footsteps move through the house above me.

He told me his wife passed three years ago.

The notebook in my hands was written by a woman named Rachel.

The stain on the futon was there before I moved in.

And the ad said $650 a month.

---

*The listing for 1847 Oleander Drive appeared on Zillow on April 15th. Basement unit. Fully finished. Own entrance. Utilities included.*

Glen walked to the metal door. He unlocked the deadbolt. He opened it.

A backyard with a wooden fence. A bird feeder. A small patio with two plastic chairs. The back of the neighbor's house was visible over the fence. Someone was grilling. I could smell charcoal.

""See?"" Glen said. ""Totally private. You'd come and go through here. I'd never even know you were home.""

I got in my car. I drove away.



I went back three days later.

$650 a month. The number kept repeating in my head. I'd looked at four other places. A room in a house with six other tenants and one bathroom. A converted garage with no heat. A ""cozy studio"" that was actually a closet with a hot plate. A place that wanted first, last, and security up front. $3,600 before I could move a single box.

$650. Utilities included.

I told myself I'd been paranoid. Watched too many crime shows. Jumped at shadows. The bolt was for security. The stain was coffee. The smell was the P-trap. The rust was rust.

I told my friend Megan I was going back for a second look.

""Text me when you get there,"" she said. ""And when you leave.""

""It's fine. It's a normal house.""

""Just text me.""

I texted her when I parked. 1847 Oleander. Here.

Glen answered the door in the same gray polo. The same khakis. The same New Balance sneakers.

""Sarah. Good to see you again.""

""I wanted another look. If that's okay.""

""Of course. Come in.""

The house was the same. Werther's Originals. TV Guide. Family photos. Crossword puzzle, a few more squares filled in. The coffee mug was in a different spot by the Keurig. There was a plate in the sink now. A fork.

We went down to the basement.

The futon was the same. The stain was the same. The shower curtain was the same. Fourteen cartoon fish.

But the dripping had stopped.

""Fixed the washer,"" Glen said. ""Finally got around to it.""

I walked to the bathroom. The smell was different. Lilac now. Air freshener. I looked at the floor. The corner by the shower was clean. No brown line.

""I mopped,"" Glen said. ""Figured if you were coming back, I should make an effort.""

I stood there. The shower curtain hung still. The cartoon fish smiled at me. Patrick had his arms raised like he was celebrating something.

""Can I see inside?""

""The shower?""

""Yes.""

Glen looked at me. His expression didn't change. He didn't ask why.

""Sure,"" he said. He walked over and pulled the curtain back.

A white tub. A chrome faucet. A bar of Irish Spring soap in a dish. A bottle of Suave shampoo. The drain had a rubber stopper in it. No rust. No stain. No anything.

""I told you,"" Glen said. ""I cleaned.""

I looked at the tub. I looked at the drain. I looked at Glen.

""I'll take it,"" I said.



I moved in on a Saturday.

Glen helped me carry boxes. He made small talk about the neighborhood. He told me which day the garbage truck came. He told me the WiFi password was ""Oleander47"" and that I should help myself to anything in the garden. Tomatoes would be coming in by July.

I set up the futon with my own sheets. I put my clothes in the closet. I stocked the mini fridge with yogurt and Diet Coke and string cheese.

The first night, I lay in the dark and listened to the house above me. Glen's footsteps. The creak of his weight on old floorboards. Water running. A toilet flushing. Then nothing.

I tried to sleep.

The futon smelled like my sheets. Fabric softener. Lavender. But underneath, if I pressed my face into the cushion, there was something else. Something the previous tenant had left behind. Something that didn't wash out.

I told myself it was nothing.



The second week, I noticed the outside door was stuck.

Not locked. The deadbolt turned fine. But the door wouldn't open. Like the frame had swelled, or something was blocking it.

I mentioned it to Glen when I saw him in the driveway.

""Humidity,"" he said. ""These old houses. I'll take a look.""

He didn't take a look.



The third week, I noticed the bolt on the basement door.

I was coming up the stairs to use the main entrance. The inside one, through his house. The outside door was still stuck. I'd stopped trying it.

The bolt was engaged.

I stood on the stairs looking at the white door. The white door with the bolt on the outside. The bolt I couldn't reach from where I was standing.

I knocked.

Footsteps above me. The bolt slid back. The door opened.

""Sorry,"" Glen said. He was holding a spatula. Eggs. I could smell eggs. ""Force of habit. I'm so used to locking up when I'm cooking.""

""It's okay.""

""I'll try to remember. Now that you're here.""

He smiled. The smile reached his eyes.

I went out through his kitchen. Past the notepad. Past the pens. Past the coffee mug and the family photos and the bowl of Werther's Originals. The woman in the pictures watched me from the mantle. Gray-blonde hair. Same smile as Glen.

I wondered what she died of. I wondered if it was really cancer.

I told myself to stop. I told myself I was being crazy. I told myself the door was stuck because of humidity and the bolt was habit and the smell in the futon was nothing and the stain was coffee and the rust was rust.

I went to work. I came home. I ate string cheese and watched Netflix on my laptop with my headphones in. Above me, Glen's footsteps moved through the house. Kitchen. Living room. Bathroom. Bedroom. A rhythm. Predictable. Like a clock.



The fourth week, my phone stopped getting signal in the basement.

Full bars in the backyard. Full bars in the driveway. Nothing downstairs. Not even one bar. Just the little ""No Service"" where the carrier name should be.

""Old houses,"" Glen said when I asked. ""The foundation's thick. Concrete. Blocks the signal.""

""It worked before.""

""Did it?""

I thought about it. I tried to remember checking my phone downstairs. Texting Megan. Scrolling Instagram. I couldn't remember. Maybe I'd always gone outside.

""I can get you a WiFi booster,"" Glen said. ""For the calling. It plugs into the router upstairs. Should help.""

""That would be great.""

He never got the booster.



The fifth week, I found the notebook.

I was looking for something in the closet. A box I hadn't unpacked. The closet was deeper than I'd thought. There was a space in the back, behind my hanging clothes, where the wall met the foundation.

The notebook was on the floor. Wedged into the corner like someone had hidden it there.

Composition book. Black and white marble cover. The kind you'd use in school.

I opened it.

The handwriting was small. Cramped. Female, I thought, though I don't know why I thought that.

*Day 1. He locked the door. I don't understand.*

*Day 3. He says I can leave when I pay what I owe. I don't know what I owe.*

*Day 5. The outside door doesn't open. He says it's humidity.*

*Day 8. He takes things. Small things. He says I won't miss them.*

*Day 12. I found the drain. Under the shower. It comes up. There's a space under there.*

*Day 15. I can hear her down there. The one before me. I don't think she's alive but I can hear her.*

The notebook went on. The handwriting got worse. Shakier. The entries got shorter.

*Day 23. He showed me the toolbox.*

*Day 24. He used the pliers.*

*Day 31. My name is Rachel. My name is Rachel. My name is Rachel.*

The last entry was just one line.

*Day 40. He's coming.*

I stood in the closet holding the notebook. My hands weren't shaking. That's the strange thing. My hands were completely steady.

I walked to the basement stairs. I walked up. I tried the door.

The bolt was engaged.

I knocked.

Nothing.

I knocked harder.

""Glen?""

Above me, footsteps. Slow. Unhurried. The footsteps stopped at the door.

""Glen, I need to come up.""

""Not right now, Sarah.""

His voice was the same. Friendly. Conversational.

""The door's locked.""

""I know.""

""Glen, I need to leave.""

""No,"" he said. ""I don't think you do.""

I heard him walk away. The footsteps moved through the kitchen. Living room. Bathroom. The rhythm. Predictable. Like a clock.



I'm writing this in the notebook. After Rachel's entry. After Day 40. There were blank pages in the back.

The outside door doesn't open. I've tried it every day. It's not stuck. There's something on the other side. A padlock, maybe. Something.

My phone has no signal. It's been nineteen days.

Glen comes down three times a day. Morning. Noon. Night. He brings food on a plastic tray. Scrambled eggs. A ham sandwich. Spaghetti with meat sauce. He's a good cook. He told me so.

""My wife always loved my cooking,"" he said. ""She said I could have been a chef.""

He says things like that. Normal things. Then he sits on the futon and asks me about my day. What I've been thinking about. What I'm reading. He brings me books from upstairs. Paperback thrillers. Crossword puzzles. He says he doesn't want me to get bored.

He's kind to me. That's the part I can't explain. He's kind in a way that makes everything else worse.

I found the drain. The one Rachel mentioned. Under the shower. The grate comes up if you pull hard enough. There's a crawlspace down there. Dirt floor. Three feet of clearance. It smells like the thing the Febreze was trying to cover.

I didn't go down. I don't want to know what's down there.

Yesterday Glen asked me to help him with something. He was carrying a rolled-up rug down the stairs. Heavy. He asked me to hold the bottom end.

I held it. I felt the weight inside.

We put it in the crawlspace.

""Thank you,"" he said. ""I appreciate your help.""

He made spaghetti that night. Extra garlic bread. Like a reward.



It's been thirty-two days.

The notebook is almost full. I'm writing smaller now. I want it to last.

The woman who was planting marigolds. Her name was Diane. Glen mentioned her yesterday. He said she moved. Her house is for sale.

I think about her waving at me that first day. I think about how she smiled. I think about whether she's in the crawlspace now, under the shower, in the dark.

I think about my friend Megan. I think about the text I sent her. 1847 Oleander. Here.

She knew the address. She has the address. Someone will come. Someone will find this notebook.

But the thing I can't stop thinking about. The thing that keeps me awake at night while Glen's footsteps move through the house above me.

He told me his wife passed three years ago.

The notebook in my hands was written by a woman named Rachel.

The stain on the futon was there before I moved in.

And the ad said $650 a month.



*The listing for 1847 Oleander Drive appeared on Zillow on April 15th. Basement unit. Fully finished. Own entrance. Utilities included.*

My best friend and I are going to Japan for the first time this coming Thursday (arriving Friday) and would like some restaurant recommendations. We'd also like to know cool places to shop for clothes and other random cute items.

Our goal is to go to places where we can speak English but aren't tourist traps. It is crucial for us to NOT have a ""Times Square"" overpriced, over-hyped tourist experience.

Background about us: We're both 31 year-old women from NYC and used to live in Montreal. We're laid back, stylish, artsy, and open-minded to new experiences. I gravitate towards darker edgy/gritty style and my friend is more classic and refined style. We overall want an authentic, uniquely Japanese experience!

Good food is really important to us. I'll eat pretty much anything and my friend is vegan but eats certain types of shellfish (oysters, clams, scallops, mussels) and has a ""when in Rome"" attitude with fish for this trip. We'd like recommendations for places we can eat together, but I'd also like to know where I can eat good meat and fish on my own. I'm a HUGE fan of sushi.

We would also like cute cafe recommendations for coffee and/or matcha. We don't party or drink much but enjoy a nice cocktail here and there so I'm curious about cool bars as well.

We'll be in Osaka the first 5 nights (with a day trip to Kyoto) then Tokyo for the remaining 7 nights. Our Osaka airbnb is in Suminoe. Our Tokyo airbnb is in Kagurazaka. Of course we'll be exploring as much of these cities as we can so I'm open to suggestions anywhere!

One thing that interests me is that when the main character is on trial and he is being judged more of the trial is focused on his personal life and attitude towards the universe than on the actual crime itself. 

When the prosecutor asks him all the personal questions about how he goes through life and his lack of conviction/emotion about it, he is given a pretty honest description and does see Mersault for what he is but in the end the verdict is kind of wrong, is it not? It made an impression to me that if it was decided that Mersault killed the Arab ''in the heat of the moment'' he would spend a few years in prison then be let go, but if it was premeditated then he would be executed - and that's what ends up happening despite us knowing that the homicide was planned at all.

My question here would be, would you have Mersault executed? Everything about his philosophy on life is quite dangerous in a person, as we are shown. And to an extent, at least to me, his carelessness about human life is disgusting and revolting, yet still I found myself being happy in the few moments when the trial was going in his favour (for example when the keeper of the home admitted that he had offered him coffee and he had smoked also). 

It is interesting that Mersault for me ends up being a person that both disgusts me and I end up kind of loving regardless? He is in many ways a monster, after all. Did you end up wanting the best for him or were you happy for the death penalty verdict? Do you think the prosecutor and the jury would've ruled differently if they also had a direct look into his mind that they could trust completely 100%?",6,1768397599.0,literature,2,0.88,False

1qcncwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_onemessymama_/comments/1qcncwo/jobs_ai_will_never_replace/,Jobs AI Will Never Replace,"Sitting here with my coffee, it suddenly hits me: we have three teenagers under this roof. I know. Go ahead and send the chocolate. [Parenting is difficult](https://onemessymama.com/admitting-that-parenting-is-difficult/)!

So here I am, just thinking out loud—how are we supposed to help our kids figure out what they want to do with their lives? Some days, I wish they’d grown up in the 80s like I did, when career advice was basically, ‘Pick something and stick with it.’ Simple, right? Now the world spins so fast I can barely keep up, and honestly, I have no idea what jobs will exist in twenty years. Anyone else feeling a little lost, or am I the only one?

# What kind of future are we preparing our kids for, honestly?

AI is everywhere these days. It writes essays, makes art, and answers questions before I can even finish typing them. Depending on which headline you read, it’s either the best thing since sliced bread or the monster that’s about to steal all our jobs. And we need to start asking our children some[ open-ended](https://onemessymama.com/top-10-open-ended-toys/) questions.

If you’re raising tweens or teens, this lands differently. We’re not just watching technology change; we’re raising people who will have to live and work right in the middle of it.

But let’s look for the good news first.

Here’s what I keep coming back to: even with all the noise, there are jobs AI just can’t touch. And figuring out why says a lot about what actually matters for our kids’ future.

Spoiler: it’s not about being perfect, fast, or super-productive.

It’s about being human.

# AI Will Replace Tasks—Not People

AI is incredibly good at tasks.  
It’s not good at being human.

AI can:

* Analyze data
* Follow patterns
* Predict outcomes
* Work nonstop

But it can’t:

* Feel empathy
* Build trust
* Take moral responsibility
* Show up with presence and heart

And honestly? That’s where the hope lives.

The jobs that last won’t be the ones that look shiny on paper. They’ll be the ones rooted in connection, judgment, creativity, and care. The stuff you can’t fake.

# Jobs Built on Human Connection Will Always Matter

Think about the people who have shaped your life the most.

A teacher who supported your child.  
A nurse who treated you like a person, not a chart.  
A counsellor who listened without rushing.  
A pastor, mentor, or friend who showed up when life fell apart.

Those roles don’t work without emotional intelligence. It takes me right back to my teaching days, where I always said a child’s EQ matters way more than their IQ. (Just my two cents.)

AI can offer information.  
It cannot offer presence.

That’s why careers like:

* Teachers (especially elementary and middle school)
* Counsellors and therapists
* Nurses and caregivers
* Social workers
* Spiritual leaders

aren’t going anywhere.

Parents don’t just want answers for their kids.  
They want someone who understands their child.

And that can’t be automated.

# Skilled Trades: The Quiet Comeback

For years, we were told success meant a desk job, a degree, and a screen.

Now? The people who can fix things are worth their weight in gold.

Homes are different. Systems are messy. Real-world problems don’t follow neat instructions.

That’s why AI struggles with hands-on work like:

* Electricians
* Plumbers
* HVAC technicians
* Mechanics
* Construction trades

These jobs require judgment, adaptability, and physical skill in unpredictable environments.

Funny thing is, while we’re all worried about robots taking jobs, a lot of skilled trades are actually desperate for workers.

This is a reminder I need on repeat as a mom (and as someone who still has no clue on how to fix a leaky faucet):

Not every smart kid needs to sit still or love academics to have a good future.

Some kids are builders. Problem-solvers. Fixers. Doers.

And the world? It will always need kids like that.

# Creativity Can’t Be Replaced—Only Imitated

Yes, AI can write poems.  
It can generate images.  
And remix ideas faster than any human.



But here’s what it can’t do.

It can’t create meaning from lived experience.

True creativity comes from:

* Pain
* Joy
* Faith
* Failure
* Love
* Loss

AI can copy styles.  
It cannot tell your story.

That’s why writers, artists, designers, musicians, and creators who bring their real selves will always matter.

People don’t just want content.

They want a connection.

And in a world flooded with artificial output, real voices will stand out even more.

# Leadership, Ethics, and Decision-Making Stay Human

There are moments in life when there is no “right” answer—only responsibility.

Courtrooms. Hospitals. Crisis situations. Families. Communities.

AI can present options.  
But it can’t carry moral weight.

That’s why roles involving:

* Leadership
* Ethics
* Mediation
* Vision-setting
* Crisis response

will always require humans.

When consequences matter, people want accountability.

They want someone who can say, “This was my decision—and I stand by it.”

Algorithms can’t do that.

# Work With Children Will Always Need Humans

This one feels personal.

Children don’t need efficiency.  
They need safety, patience, and attachment.

AI can tutor.  
It can’t nurture.

Roles involving kids—especially young or vulnerable ones—require emotional attunement and trust:

* Parents
* Childcare providers
* Special education teachers
* Youth mentors
* School counselors

No machine can replace a calm adult presence when a child feels scared, overwhelmed, or unseen.

And honestly? That matters more than any career trend or headline.

# What This Means for Our Kids (and for Us)

If you’re raising kids right now, here’s the takeaway I’m clinging to (some days with both hands and maybe a little prayer):

The future doesn’t belong to the fastest, most automated, or most optimised.

It belongs to the:

* Emotionally intelligent
* Creatively curious
* Ethically grounded
* Adaptable
* Human

Instead of asking, “What jobs will still exist?”  
Maybe we should ask, “What kind of people will the world still need?”

And the answer? It feels surprisingly old-fashioned:

* People who care
* People who create
* People who lead with integrity
* People who can work with their hands and hearts

We’re raising kids in a world that changes faster than I can fold a load of laundry. (And let’s be honest, that’s pretty fast some days.)

But here’s what hasn’t changed:

Love matters.  
Character matters.  
Human connection matters.

[AI may reshape the world](https://www.nexford.edu/insights/how-will-ai-affect-jobs), but it can’t replace what makes us human.

And that? That’s what gives me hope.",1,1768397566.0,u_onemessymama_,0,1.0,False

Not a dating thing. Not a “commit to plans” thing either. More like showing up when you feel like it, skipping when you don’t.

I’m glad i tried this at first in the AM, if i had tried this in the evening i likely would have had trouble sleeping.

I consider myself a caffeine sensitive individual. As coffee is too powerful for me, I do drink Matcha daily, and the boost felt similar to drinking a cup of matcha (15-20mg of caffeine). I see on the label that this powder has green tea extract (could be just egcg, or egcg and caffeine, not sure…) and cocoa, but no explicit mention of caffeine.

Huel’s website chatbot says there is no caffeine, however, via chatGPT i found a blog post where Huel said there is indeed caffeine (6mg).

Can someone from Huel confirm indeed how much caffeine is in Huel Black (chocolate), and can they request to corporate to actually label their product(s) with this information? Thank you!",1,1768397345.0,Huel,7,1.0,False

I've only had to test once so far and apparently the results came back diluted and the only reason why would have to be because I had 2 cups of coffee before my test because one, that's just how I exist on a daily basis, and two, I wanted to make sure I was ready to give my sample.

Thinking of a group for people who’ve moved back from abroad to India, where we can talk about the good, the bad, the culture shock, career stress, moving back, rant a little, or maybe a lot, life in general. Kind of a mix between a hangout group and a support group lol.

Are there any such meetup groups in Delhi/Gurgaon already? If not, I would love to start one. We could keep it casual, coffee, walks, chill meetups, and see where it goes.

1qcn4zm,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1qcn4zm/echos_of_the_void_chapter_3_pt2/,Echos of the void chapter 3 pt-2,"Titus and Kelly walked the quiet corridors toward his quarters, the station’s evening cycle casting soft amber light along the grated decking. Their shoulders brushed with every few steps—accidental at first, then deliberate. Neither moved away.

When they reached his door, Titus palmed the lock. It hissed open.

“Just a sec,” he said, stepping inside. “I’ll grab it.”

He walked in, leaving the door open behind him. The room was small, as all trainee quarters were: single bunk against one wall, narrow desk bolted to the deck, tiny sink and mirror in the corner, a single viewport the size of a dinner plate showing the slow wheel of stars. Everything functional. Nothing wasted.

He heard the soft pneumatic sigh of the door sealing shut.

Titus turned.

Kelly stood just inside, back against the closed hatch, arms loosely crossed, a small, knowing smile on her face.

His heart kicked hard against his ribs. For a second he didn’t know what to do—stand there frozen, offer her the desk chair, say something stupid about the mess on the floor.

Kelly tilted her head, eyes bright. “Let’s see what music you’ve got.”

She patted the edge of the bunk beside her.

Titus swallowed once, then crossed the tiny space and sat. He left a careful meter between them—polite, nervous.

Kelly laughed softly. “I’m not going to bite, Titus. Move over here.”

She patted the spot again, closer.

He slid over until their thighs touched. The warmth of her body was immediate, grounding. He could smell the faint citrus from her shower gel, the clean scent of her skin.

They started talking music first—easy, safe ground. He pulled up the playlist on his pad. Synthwave tracks from Phorantis’s old dock shifts, then older Terran stuff: classic rock from the pre-Principality era, some jazz with brushed drums, even a haunting electronic piece from the early orbital days. Kelly listened, head tilted, eyes half-closed, smiling at the right moments.

The conversation drifted, as conversations do when two people are sitting close enough to feel each other’s warmth.

Kelly asked about girlfriends. Titus hesitated, then answered honestly.

“I had one. About a year ago. She was offered a job on Macha—good pay, long contract. Distance… it wasn’t going to work. We both knew it.”

Kelly nodded slowly. “Happens a lot out here. People come, people go. The void doesn’t care about plans.”

She paused, then asked quietly, “And you? You ever think about leaving? Living on a planet?”

Titus looked at the viewport, stars sliding past. “I’d like to run a shuttle based on one someday. Feel real gravity. See sky that doesn’t end at a bulkhead.”

Kelly smiled—soft, almost wistful. “I’d like that too. Sometimes.”

They talked about friends—hers mostly station-born, his mostly dock kids from Phorantis. Parents—hers still here, logistics and admin; his just his mom, the woman who’d kept everything together alone.

Kelly’s pad pinged once. She glanced at it, smiled faintly, then silenced it without replying.

They kept talking—music playing softly in the background, voices lowering as the station lights dimmed further into evening cycle. Hours slipped by unnoticed. At some point they lay back on the narrow bunk, side by side, shoulders touching, staring up at the ceiling while old Terran songs filled the small room.

Neither suggested leaving.

Kelly’s pad pinged again—insistent. She sighed.

“I really have to leave,” she murmured. “Cathy’s probably wondering where I am.”

She leaned over slowly, giving him plenty of time to pull away if he wanted. He didn’t.

Her lips brushed his—soft, warm, lingering. When she pulled back, she set her data pad down on the bunk between them.

“Keep that,” she whispered. “I’ll get it tomorrow.”

Another ping. She hit silent mode, eyes never leaving his.

They didn’t speak again after that.

They simply stayed.

Kelly curled against his side, head on his shoulder, one arm draped across his chest. Titus wrapped an arm around her, heart still racing but steadying into something calmer, deeper. They talked in murmurs until words became unnecessary, until the quiet hum of the station and the slow rhythm of their breathing were the only sounds left.

Sometime later—hours, maybe—they drifted into sleep.

Titus woke with a start, the soft chime of his data pad dragging him from dreams. The room was still dim, morning cycle just beginning. He blinked at the chrono: 0600.

His heart sank.

Edward’s message flashed on the screen:

Mess hall 0630. Don’t be late.

He bolted upright. “Oh crap.”

The bunk beside him was empty.

Kelly was gone.

He hadn’t even felt her leave.

Quick shower—cold, frantic. Dressed in fresh coveralls. Teeth brushed. Boots on. Out the door at a dead run.

He burst into the mess hall at 0627, grabbed a tray—eggs-and-bacon sandwich, black coffee, bottled water—scanned his chit, and scanned the room.

Edward was already at his usual spot near the viewport, arms crossed, expression stern enough to make Titus’s stomach twist.

Titus walked over, set his tray down carefully, and sat.

Edward didn’t speak.

Titus tried first. “Running late. Overslept. But… on time.”

Edward’s eyes narrowed. “Barely.”

Titus could see it—Edward was mad about something. The silence stretched, heavy. Titus’s mind raced.

Not Kelly. Please don’t let it be Kelly.

Edward motioned at the tray. “Eat.”

Titus started on the sandwich, appetite gone, every bite mechanical.

Edward stared at his own data pad, stoic, unreadable.

Then he looked up—past Titus—then back.

“You have a rough night?”

Titus opened his mouth, not sure what to say, cheeks already heating.

Before he could answer, a second tray slid onto the table beside his.

Kelly’s face appeared over his shoulder, smiling bright and completely unapologetic.

“Hey.”

Titus turned. Edward looked from Kelly to Titus, then cracked the smallest, most reluctant smile.

“Never mind,” Edward said, shaking his head. “She’s a grown woman. She could do worse.”

He started laughing—low, genuine, the kind of laugh that carried years of knowing people.

Kelly slid into the seat next to Titus—close enough that their thighs touched again, deliberate and warm.

Edward looked at her, still shaking his head. “We’re not running sims until after lunch. Maintenance at 0800. Try not to get him killed before then.”

Kelly grinned. “No promises.”

Edward stood, clapped Titus on the shoulder—harder than necessary—and walked off, still chuckling.

Titus stared after him, then at Kelly.

She leaned in, voice low. “Told you. He’s known my parents since before I was born. He’s not mad.”

Titus exhaled, relief flooding him. “Good.”

Kelly stole a piece of bacon from his sandwich, popping it into her mouth. “Eat. You’re going to need the energy.”

She smiled—slow, warm, full of promise.

Titus took another bite, appetite returning in a rush.

The mess hall hummed around them—crew drifting in for early shifts, the smell of coffee and reheated protein, the low thrum of the station’s life support.

And right there, at that scarred table, the day began again: breakfast, station rhythm, and the quiet certainty that whatever came next, he wouldn’t be facing it alone.

Kelly nudged him lightly. “You still owe me that music playlist.”

Titus grinned. “Tonight. After maintenance. I’ll bring the pad.”

She leaned closer, voice a playful murmur. “It’s a date.”

The words hung between them—simple, electric.

Titus felt the warmth settle deeper.

He was exactly where he wanted to be

Titus glanced at the chrono—0752—and stood, leaving the half-eaten sandwich behind. The corridors were busier now, shift change traffic flowing steadily. He took the nearest lift down to the lower deck, the station’s familiar hum vibrating through the deck plates.

Edward was waiting just inside the main maintenance bay entrance, arms crossed, expression calm but expectant. He nodded once when he saw Titus.

“Morning. Follow me.”

They walked past rows of docked trainers and cargo haulers, the air thick with the smell of hot metal, lubricant, and ozone. Edward led him to a far corner of the bay, where a full-sized shuttle had been permanently mounted in a cutaway display frame—hull sliced open lengthwise like a dissected specimen, every internal component visible, color-coded, labeled, and lit for instruction.

Edward stopped in front of it. “This is the training mockup. Same Kestrel-class as yours. No better way to understand how she breathes than seeing her insides.”

Titus stared up at the exposed guts of the shuttle—wiring bundles, thrust vector actuators, the navigation core, fuel lines snaking through the frame like arteries. It was beautiful in a brutal, mechanical way.

Edward turned to him. “You said you rebuilt yours from scrap. What have you actually worked on back home?”

Titus stepped closer, eyes tracing the familiar layout. “This exact model. I started helping the old guys on the docks when I was twelve—mostly small stuff at first. Cleaning injectors, checking seals. By fourteen I was doing full avionics swaps and thrust calibration under supervision. When I started rebuilding mine, they gave me the hard parts: synchronizers, ejectors, the nav core rebuild, thrusters overhaul. I did most of it myself.”

Edward gave a slow nod, respect clear in the set of his jaw. “That’s not cadet work. That’s journeyman level.”

Titus smiled faintly, remembering. “The old timers drank a lot of beer, but man, they knew their stuff. They’d sit around with a case of whatever was cheap that week, arguing about torque values and bypass routing like it was religion. Then they’d hand me a wrench and say, ‘Don’t break it, kid.’”

Edward shook his head, a deep, rumbling laugh escaping him. “Sounds about right. Every dock in the belt’s got that same crew. Half the time they’re drunk, the other half they’re saving your ass with tricks no manual ever taught. Hell, I knew a guy who could rebuild a thrust vector in his sleep—usually after three beers and a bet he couldn’t do it blindfolded. Swear he never spilled a drop.”

Titus grinned. “Yeah. Same guys. They’d hand me the torque wrench and say, ‘Don’t strip it, or you’re buying the next round.’”

Edward chuckled again, softer this time. “Good men. Rough around the edges, but they taught you right.”

They spent the next few hours moving methodically through the mockup. Edward pointed out systems, asked questions, listened to Titus’s answers without interrupting. Titus explained torque values, bypass routing, how to balance fuel feed under variable spin—details he’d learned by feel and necessity long before he ever read a manual.

Around 1200, Edward’s data pad pinged again.

He glanced at the screen, stepped a few paces away, and answered the call.

Titus stayed by the mockup, running a hand along the exposed thrust housing, half-listening.

Edward’s voice was low but clear. “Yes, sir.”

A pause. Hale’s voice came through the speaker, tinny but unmistakable.

“Ask Titus when he first left-seat a shuttle. Just a sec.”

Edward turned. “Hey, Titus. When did you first fly left seat on a shuttle?”

Titus blinked, caught off guard. “Uh… I was fourteen.”

Silence on the other end. Then Hale’s voice again, quieter now.

“No need to run sims today. I’ve got several others who need the time more. Tell Titus he owes me two hours of workout today. That’s an order.”

The screen went blank.

Edward pocketed the pad and looked at Titus. “Hale says two hours of workout. It’s an order.” He jerked his head toward the exit. “We’ll get out of here. Oh—and make sure you check in and out on the fitness log. You must have forgotten yesterday.”

Titus felt his ears heat. He hadn’t forgotten. He’d simply… been distracted.

Edward clapped him on the shoulder—lighter this time—and walked off toward the bay offices, leaving Titus alone with the dissected shuttle.

Titus exhaled slowly.

Two hours. Workout. Order.

He headed back toward his quarters, the station’s corridors quieter now in the midday lull. The weight of the morning settled around him—not heavy, just… present.

He had two hours to fill.

And somewhere in the back of his mind, the memory of Kelly’s smile, her hand brushing his, the quiet hours in his bunk, lingered like the afterglow of a star.

He smiled to himself as he walked.

Two hours of workout suddenly didn’t feel like punishment at all.

*A bit from “MY Fantasy Life” (cred: Eigenstien) or, as BlancheFromage suspects, “one of the many fake characters within the SGI-RV fantasy scenario created by a lonely, low-income, isolated, cult-addicted, mentally-ill elderly woman.”*

*I am very glad I have Blanche & Friends across the hedges denying everything I have observed over the course of my five years of practicing SGI Buddhism. Let’s see.

>BlancheFromage’s “WHY SGI engages in such dangerous faith-healing magical thinking just like Christians do” and CallMeBeafie’s “Soka Gakkai’s dangerous faith healing magical thinking propaganda”

*As anyone following me knows, I study SGI-USA publications diligently. I can’t remember reading any article that encourages readers to skip that doctor visit. I mean Guy just returned from a week of hospitalization at the VA. All our kids make their scheduled wellness visits. Dai’s heart condition is continually monitored by his pediatric cardiologist. At Longhouse, we hired a nurse this week because of the flu and RSV waves that are running wild. Two doctors are on our school Board of Trustees and a lot of their colleagues contribute to our scholarship fund. And I am the Queen Consumer of Mental Health Services, with a long history of therapy and psychiatric care. And since Blanche has the ability to be anywhere and everywhere—including inside the minds of all SGI members—I am sure she can (--“’t”--) recall all the times my leaders have told me not to see the doctor and rely on faith-healing. Oh, and some SG vice president back in the 1980s wrote something about the power of the Gohonzon that adds an extra dimension to healing. That surely overrides everything I have heard, read, or experienced in my practice, including the earliest conversations Guy and I had with our sponsors.*

*True, I’m an OG Wild One, maybe that’s why the propaganda couldn’t penetrate my little b---- armor. But surely, all other SGI members around the world besides me have disavowed themselves from medical science—including the health practitioners who are in the Doctors Division.*

*And let’s discount all of those experiences in SGI pubs that tell the stories of members pushing back illness, relying on their medications, the skills of their physicians, and the power of prayer. And I will be sure not to read the latest January 16th WT on my desk with its [story of Michael Sasaki and Miho Sasaki](https://www.worldtribune.org/2026/alumni-create-award-winning-film-that-builds-empathy-through-story/) who created a short film that was recently named runner-up for the “Best LGBTQIA Short Film” at the Hague International Film Festival. And what was their film about? Michael Sasaki’s personal experiences navigating mental health challenges. Blanche, better run to Home Depot and buy a bigger hose for your fire extinguisher because this film is encouraging aspectw of faith-healing (compassion for people who are suffering from illness, providing hope, bringing humor into darkness, incorporating respect for diverse perspectives, engaging in heartfelt conversations, and incorporating multiple perspectives into the long journey. Stamp the spreading fires of faith-based healing out, Blanche! Stamp, stamp, stamp!*

*And while we are on this topic, Blanche tells me that “The SGI is certainly a pressure-cooker of a cult.” How come I only feel joy and purpose as an SGI member and not pressure? I shouldn’t feel lonely though. Blanche & Company criticize [Evangelical Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism_in_the_United_States), too--all 79 million of them, one quarter of the US population. How could their collective experiences match the spot on articulations of Buddha Blanche? So much wasted pressure-cooking!*

*More to follow on some recent WBer posts. Much more.*

*Since our little streaking episode with our winter ~~ clients~~friends, Jericho's walls have been tumbling down here. At first I thought it was a fluke, but since Monday a good half-dozen people join me for the early morning Perimeter Walk. It’s the best exercise, our conversation is very convivial, we yell and laugh at each other, and we come to agree to disagree. Now, after the walk, we added a quick Nordic dip into the pool as long as we are far away by the time the Longhouse Children arrive for Track. I will leave some details to the imagination.*

*To accommodate this new activity, we have stretched out Coffee Hour so it starts right after the Walk and Swim. More joking and I’m often the butt of the jokes. It’s OK. There’s one very interesting thing to add. This group of people are rugged self-starters and have no expectations of “being served.” They do everything themselves. They have everything organized, taking turns making coffee, bringing and setting out food, and cleaning up. And all with hearty smiles and laughter! How come I had never noticed and appreciated this before?*

Let me block out all of those winter swimming in the heated pool images and resume studying Daisaku Ikeda’s Gosho lecture in the January Living Buddhism, [Courage—Your Determination to Win in This Moment Can Change Everything](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/courage-your-determination-to-win-in-this-moment-can-change-everything/). Today it's the sixth section, “The Vibrant Spirit of ‘True Cause.”

Regarding the phrase  by “exerting ourselves bravely and vigorously,” we activate the “three Buddha bodies with which we are eternally endowed” (OTT, 214). Then, Daisaku Ikeda states, “the Buddha’s compassion and wisdom come flowing forth like a wellspring from within, and we find the true strength innate in our lives”:

>The Daishonin offers a deeper interpretation. He suggests an alternative reading: “Constant diligence day and night—this has always been the way to seek the Buddha way” (OTT, 214). In other words, by striving diligently in our Buddhist practice day and night, we fulfill our vow from the remote past. Diligent practice is the key. Those who carry out diligent practice by devoting themselves to kosen-rufu manifest, in instant after instant, the three Buddha bodies.

“Striving diligently in our Buddhist practice”—I can do that! Yes, I strike back day and night against Ms. Depersonalization and Ms. Derealization who are the twin daughters of my Dissociative Disorder. They limit my ability to be in the moment and to be the heroic protagonist in life. Yes, Blanche, I do incorporate the strategy of “fake it till I make it (FITIMI)”.

Dr. Ikeda continues:

>By maintaining deep-seated resolve to continue chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo oneself and to teach others to do the same, no matter what happens, the spirit of constant diligence will become firmly rooted in your lives. As long as we never forget to chant throughout the ever-changing circumstances of our lives, our spirit to seek the Buddha way will remain strong and keep burning brightly, which is the meaning of “this has always been the way to seek the Buddha way.”

It’s simply common sense that transplanting and grafting take time; a plant must work hard to sink its roots deep into the soil. *Moi, aussi!*

>This is the dynamic life state of the Buddhist spirit of “true cause”—of always moving forward from this moment on—a life state that is ever new, ever strong, and ever dedicated. It is what the Daishonin means when he says, “Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is just such a ‘diligent’ practice.” 

Today JulieSongwriter will move forward from this moment on. Are you looking for an example of “a life state that is ever new, ever strong, and ever dedicated”? Watch me in the few days ahead while we support the Longhouse School MLK Weekend Family Sleepout and the RV Park District discussion meeting. From impossible to possible, from good to great.

Dr. Ikeda questions:

>Why does the Soka Gakkai always brim with a vibrant spirit of growth and development? Because its members—men, women, young, and old—embody this unflagging seeking spirit in faith. They embody the courage to challenge their human revolution and work for kosen-rufu.

According to BlancheFromage’s post “Buddhism and right speech—and SGI” I, as one simple SGI member, feel “completely, *righteously* justified in whatever [I] feel like doing.” Blanche asks whether I believe that people who decide to leave the SGI have “**THE RIGHT** to express themselves and their persspectives in their own words?” Huh??? Do I think “they need to ask MY permission first?” Double Huh??? And, I am reading that “I *DO* expect them to only talk about what *I* am comfortable talking about?” 

I mean, do I really spend hours thinking about these questions every day when I am worrying about we FKKers getting out of the pool before the Longhouse Children arrive, about feeding 75 children, parents, siblings over the course of a weekend vacation winter sleepover, and how Josh Allen and his 6th-seeded Bills who are playing two playoff games in a single week could ever prevail over the top-seeded Denver Broncos who have had two weeks to rest and prepare.

1qcn1cq,https://www.reddit.com/r/financial/comments/1qcn1cq/money_problem_is_because_no_tracking/,Money Problem Is Because No Tracking,"Many people think they are bad with money. They say “I don’t know where my salary goes” or “I can’t save anything.” I used to feel same also. Every month I was thinking I will save from next month, but next month also same story. Salary comes, and after some days it feels finished.

But honestly, most of the time the real problem is not money less. The real problem is we don’t track it. We spend small small things daily and we don’t notice. Food order, coffee, random shopping, online apps, small recharge, taxi, some extra things. One one time it looks small, but end of month it becomes big.

When you don’t track, money looks like water. It goes out and you don’t know from where. And then you start blaming yourself like “I am bad with money.” But you are not bad, you are just blind about your spending.

One day I tried one simple thing. I made a basic sheet. Not fancy. Just write down what I earn, and what I spend. That’s it. First few days it feels boring. Like why I am doing this. But after one week you start seeing truth. You start seeing that money is not going only in big expenses. Money is going in small habits.

And the best part is, when you see it, you can control it. You don’t need to stop enjoying life. You just need to stop wasting money without knowing. Tracking doesn’t mean you become cheap person. Tracking means you become smart person.

Because money is not only about earning. Money is also about handling. If you track, you will understand your month better. You will feel less stress. You will know how much you can spend and how much you should keep.

So if you feel you are bad with money, try tracking for one month. Just one month. Write everything. Even small 20 rupees things. Then you will understand where your money is going. And trust me, one simple sheet can change your month.

If anyone has a simple method they use for tracking, share it. I also want to learn more easy ways.",3,1768396713.0,financial,0,1.0,False

From what they've said, it hooks right into the GoMining app super smooth. Handles both crypto and fiat, so you can cash out, shop online/in stores, or just throw it back into more mining without jumping through hoops.

Stuff that's confirmed so far:

\- Balance updates in real time from your account

\- Cashback and extra reward levels depending on what NFT miners you hold (bigger bag = better perks, obvs)

\- Works with Apple Pay/Google Pay and pretty much everywhere normal cards do

It sits behind a latch broken since November,

letting in a draft that smells of asphalt and skin.

A coffee stain marks the year you stopped asking for permission to exist.

You stand while the salt of twenty years dries to a crust.

The tide is out, leaving bleached ribs in the mud.

The chair knows your weight hasn't changed.

\_\_\_\_

You sit on the edge and bite your cheek.

Knuckles waxy and white,

fingers fused into a fist around a ghost.

The velvet is the only place you are allowed to be tired.

The radiator hits the pipes with a metallic click.

The same sound you heard at six years old

while the shouting in the kitchen

turned into a heavy, wet silence.

\_\_\_\_

The threat is already wearing your watch.

There is a boy in the chair where you should be.

He holds a grape popsicle melting into the fabric.

A purple stain.

He is the version of you that didn't make it out.

The floorboards are soft,

rotting over a crawlspace of hair and teeth.

If you stop moving, the wood gives way.

If you touch his shoulder, you both fall.

The chair is the only island left.

\_\_\_\_

The barter is simple:

you sold the warmth for the seat.

Now you are an orphan robbing your own grave.

The pulse turns white as the marrow

finishes your blood.

You are a wick watching the flame eat the life you had.

You aren't burned out.

You are a battery in a dead remote,

sinking into the velvet because it held you

without asking for a receipt.

\_\_\_\_

The roar comes, then the quiet.

A charcoal frame scorched into the wood,

the shadow of someone too afraid to be seen.

Gravity takes the rest.

The springs snap, rusted and tired.

The fabric is gone,

leaving a wire skeleton in the draft.

My partner and I have been together for 6 years now. Our relationship is so lovely. I was a mental and emotional mess when we met. He has stuck by me when I needed breaks to go to therapy for a while, he has been incredibly patient for the times that I was doing therapy during us actively dating. He makes me feel loved every single day in so many different actions.

Now for me; I struggle so damn much with turning my feelings into actions. Primarily my memory is god awful. I deal with chronic fatigue from a genetic condition (hEDS whoopie!) and the brain fog really fucks with my memory. I cannot keep a throughline train of thought between hours let alone days. The most recent example of me fucking up is when we visited home for the holidays. We knew that after our visit home, we would be splitting ways for over a month due to some passport issues (I study abroad and he lives with me abroad). He's staying home while he gets his new passport, I am at school. He communicated that he is upset that we can't go back together and said it would really help him if I could spend one more night with him at his parents house before I left. I said yes! of course! A few days later, it's the day of the plan (Our 6 year anniversary also). However, that morning we only ever discussed getting coffee that day and the sleepover plan was days prior. I completely forgot he said that and that I agreed. Even when he brought up that we had talked about it I could not recall the conversation until I looked back at our texts. Lo and behold, yeah, I just completely blanked and left him feeling unconsidered, unloved, unimportant, on our 6 year anniversary for goodness sake.

Now some may be able to say like - yeah really shitty timing for a mistake like that but there are reasons and considerations etc etc - but I've been doing these exact things our entire relationship. He has communicated multiple times with great patience and understanding that he doesn't feel loved in our relationship even though he consciously knows I love him, he just rarely feels it from me.

Something that really doesn't help as well is that I have a history of sexual trauma that has made it difficult for me to be interested in let alone initiate sex or intimacy. There even was a loooong period in our relationship where he completely supported us not having sex while I tried to heal some of my wounds and figure out how to move forward (I was in therapy that whole time as well).

He most recently communicated that he isn't going to give an ultimatum because he feels those miss so much context, but, he is getting to the end of his understanding and needs to be in a relationship where he feels loved again. He wants for that to be with me but he needs me to be aware that he's not in the relationship he needs right now.

So here is what I have been doing to work on it;

\- I am taking detoxing from social media seriously. My memory is obliterated if I am just a zombie on a screen. Social media only lives on my laptop and desktop. Never my phone or tablet.

\- I am trying to write down more things, journal my day, put events in my planner, just so I don't have to rely on my glitchy brain to remember

\- I am trying to make sure I stay on top of my studies to avoid massive stress dumps and be more available to him on a day by day.

\- I am trying to be really on top of my antidepressants and chronic fatigue meds. The moment I slip on these I have the mental capacity of a very sensitive little slug.

\- I am trying to be intentional about actions. He loves juices and things so I am trying to overwhelm our fridge with an immense amount of beverages for him to be surprised with when he comes back home next month. I have written down various things he has asked if I could do before he gets home (housekeeping things, a couple of snacks, etc). The jet lag he will have is 8 hours difference from our home town to where I am now so I am planning on making the most cozy, inviting nest of blankets and pillows for him to get home to. Stuff I can plan in advance where the idea is originally mine feel easy. its when he is requesting something (idea is his) or moment to moment, I didn't plan something but I miss every organic opportunity to show love.

I am feeling helpless and broken. It seems like if someone loves another, it should be second nature to show that love in so many different ways. I don't know why I struggle so much and honestly, I would have left myself a long time ago if I were him. I want to change. I don't know the way forward. :(

So TLDR, my actions don't show I love him because I keep forgetting the most important things. He doesn't feel desired sexually or intimately because I am still working through sexual trauma.",2,1768396339.0,relationshipadvice,2,1.0,False

My belief is she feared scrutiny from healthcare professionals, since she was physically and emotionally abusive towards me several times, like kicking me in the head for setting toys up instead of playing with them, throwing hot coffee in my face if I don't get out of bed, chasing me around the house with a (k)nife etc.

All women have to do is literally be at the mall or be sitting at a coffee shop and guys will talk to them. They literally have a magnetic force in their bodies that attract guys . 

And chads telling incels or lonely men, “just lift bro” or “ just David Goggins it bro” is quite comical . 

Lonely men and incels were not blessed to have a Chad like energy. These people are literally women repellants . And some incels and lonely men aren’t even that bad and disrespectful in public . Some of them try to be nice and hope that a woman will notice them . 

People make it seem like every incel is menacing and creepy and full of anger. Wrong! 

These people have no clue . And would literally be blowing their brains out if they were in incels shoes . Imagine a giga Stacie suddenly being lonely for years and years with no guys looking at them. They’d be going super crazy . Or imagine the chad that was getting more ass than rich bachelors, suddenly was seen as a brick wall. They’d be doing perks , drinking like crazy, and be going batshit crazy each day . 

Some advice women and chads give incels can be good and all but there has been some incels that have put those words into practice and still couldn’t get any type of meaningful results. 

There’s a good reason why incels subscribe to the black pill. 

And people have sexual needs. Many lonely men are probably in Pomona California as we speak and on holt street paying for sex because they crave the female touch . 

And what’s crazy is the John’s have cars and jobs and probably their own apartments and houses and still can’t attract anyone . I’m not saying every John out there in the captain America Chris Evan’s like type of gentleman but some try their hardest to attract women but nothing happens . 

And this isn’t to blame women at all. If anyone is to blame it’s life . They say life is unfair deal with it . Well okay that’s fair , but why does life go out of its way to bless chads and women 

but  why are incels and lonely men are seen as pieces of shit  on the street?

Those things are literally so expensive but still manage to give up like every 1-2 years. Now I've decided to go for a lowkey brand that does coffee machines right cuz none of the big names are doing it. Heavily leaning towards casabrews because the reviews are the unpaid honest kinda nice and the machine specs overall seem like a solid 9/10.

Out of all the machines I checked this one seemed the best tbh, the cm5418 (espresso maker + milk frother). I'm going to review it in comparison with keurig as that's the one people mostly go with.

P.S casabrews is not the pod kinda machine, you basically properly brew coffee with the grounds. Gives a lot more control and tastes much better than the quick coffee kind. You can get a grinder one if you like to grind the beans yourself too, it's not too much of an add on cost.

|**Feature**|**Casabrews**|**Keurig**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Type**|Semi-Automatic Espresso Machine|Pod + Espresso-Style|
|**Pressure**|20 bar Italian Pump|3–4 Bar (less than real espresso pressure)|
|**Coffee Type**|Ground coffee|K-Cup pods|
|**Milk Frother**|Manual steam wand|Automatic|
|**Size**|Compact|Pretty big|
|**Design**|Brushed stainless steel|Plastic|
|**Price**|$139|$199–250|

I didn’t think going into this that the differences would be so stark, but here we are.

Basically casabrews is the more authentic coffee kind brand within a budget. Plus it's super quick so a brew won't be annoying to get like it is with most machines. Only downside is it's got a 30 oz tank, almost half the size of that of keurig but considering it gives better taste i think filling a tank won't seem that bad.",1,1768395091.0,u_AccomplishedEye3671,0,1.0,False

We had a lot of the same interests both outside and inside the bedroom. At first it was just casual... as neither own of us had our own place it would be the very infrequent times that we'd have a place free that we'd hook up. At first that was fun but I wanted more and I asked if he felt the same. To his credit he let me down gently and said while he liked me he didn't see himself ever being in a relationship. That was fair and we stayed friends , this was in 2019. We'd text going from often to occasionally to long gaps inbetween and so on during lockdowns. I'm not sure I ever moved on though. I think I always had in the back of my mind that something might happen between us. 

It would have been fine if he had stayed someone I just texted but then in early 2023 he started working in the same organisation as me. Different departments but still I would see him all the time and the yearning returned. I tried not to but I always saw him as the one that got away. And I never told him how I felt at the time.

Cut to early 2024 and he tells me he has started to see someone long distance. I was happy for him but I think I always thought it would fizzle out. We'd meet for coffee and I'd smile and laugh as he'd tell me about meeting the parents etc then I'd go back to my desk depressed that it wasn't me he was with. 

Then today we met up for the 1st time since the holidays and he tells me that they have gotten engaged. I think my face said more than I meant it to coz I was quite literally shocked. I am genuinely happy for him, I know that nothing serious was ever going to happen with us but I'm back to sitting at my desk typing this and honestly trying to fight back tears. I cant stop thinking... what if. What is it that the new boyfriend was able to give that I couldn't. Why am I not able to get over someone who was never mine to begin with...

We were sitting on his porch on a Sunday afternoon, me mindlessly scrolling through social apps while supposedly ""visiting"" him.

His words hit me like a truck. I'd been feeling this gnawing emptiness for months but couldn't name it. I had constant digital connection but zero meaningful human contact. I'd text people all day but couldn't remember the last time I'd looked someone in the eyes while having a real conversation.

""In my day,"" he continued, setting down his coffee, ""we had fewer people in our lives, but we actually knew them. Really knew them. Their struggles, their joys, their stories. Now you kids know everything about everyone and nothing that matters about anybody.""

That conversation changed everything. I realized I was part of an epidemic no one was discussing functional loneliness. We're surrounded by shallow connections but starving for depth. We're afraid to be vulnerable, so we hide behind carefully curated posts and filtered photos. We've replaced community with followers and conversations with comments.

The week after talking with my grandfather, I deleted social media from my phone and started inviting people for coffee instead of just liking their photos. I joined a local book club that meets in person. I started volunteering at an animal shelter where phones aren't practical while handling dogs.

The withdrawal was real. I felt anxious, like I was missing something important. But after two weeks, something shifted. I stopped reaching for my phone first thing in the morning. I started noticing the people around me. Real conversations became easier. The emptiness began to recede.

Are you feeling it too? That disconnect between your digital social life and the hollow feeling in your chest? Maybe it's time we all acknowledged the loneliness epidemic we're living through and started rebuilding what we've lost. Real connection. Real community. Real presence.

We just had a long convo about me greeting my male colleague [late 30s and happily in a long term relationship] with a ""higher pick me voice"" while I was on the phone with my boyfriend.

The conversation was just ""Hi-Hi"" we both greeted each other with happy tone. According to my bf, it was waaay too high and why I would speak to my colleagues in this way. Like he already knows how i usually talk to people, it was just a simple greeting. Am I not thinking too much into this?? 

Im not quite used to this type of mindset since I live in Austria and everyone is and acts close with each other. But still I make sure to keep my distance to men in general so they don't get the wrong idea so I can avoid situations like this.

A similar situation happened a couple of times: with my colleague helping me with the coffee machine while we were on the call with my bf. And him saying ""you're acting very submissive and stupid around men so they help you"" For quick info: I haven't been pushed out my mom while being told how to handle coffee machines.

On lots of things he said he felt uncomfortable and disgusted by me, I made sure to not repeat it, and like I mentioned I've never been in a relationship like this before and I don't wanna seem like I complain since I love him really deeply.

But I feel like I'm changing and adjusting myself a bit too much for his liking and still don't get things right.

1qcmahy,https://www.reddit.com/r/berlinsocialclub/comments/1qcmahy/social_life_experience_in_berlin_curious_how/,Social life experience in Berlin. Curious how others handle this.,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been thinking a lot about my social life in Berlin and wanted to see if others experience something similar, or if it’s just me.

I find it quite easy to meet new people here, but much harder to build deeper, stable friendships. I’ve met plenty of people to do things with like going to the gym, grabbing coffee, or going to parties. But often it feels more like having “hangout buddies” than real friends.

And when real friendships do start to form, they can feel fragile. People move away, travel long-term, change cities, or leave Berlin altogether, and suddenly you’re starting over again. I’ve also had friendships where we live in the same city, but it still takes months, or even a year, to actually meet.

Another thing I’ve noticed is how often plans get canceled. Sometimes a day before, sometimes last minute, and occasionally when I’m already on the way. I’ve heard similar stories from friends too. The tricky part is that I’ve already blocked time for that plan, and suddenly I’m left with empty time. I don’t mind doing things alone, but it made me reflect on how I usually decide what to do next.

So I’m curious how others experience this:

* Do you find it easy or hard to build stable friendships in Berlin?
* When plans get canceled, what do you usually do with that free time?
* Do you often end up doing things alone, and if so, how do you decide what to do?
* When you have free time, do you usually plan activities in advance, or do you decide closer to the moment?
* Do you tend to initiate plans yourself, or do you prefer waiting for invitations to reduce the chance of cancellations?
* Do you usually have a plan B in mind, or do you figure things out on the spot based on mood, energy, or weather?

Just genuinely curious how others experience this city socially.

So far, so good, though I did end up at 11.5hrs yesterday because I got stuck on a call. But whatever, it's fine.

What's driving me insane is the husband made schedule changes with his own job to try and take the load off of the sitter. He doesn't want her to have to watch our toddler for a full 10hrs, so he's been breaking his work days up and shifting clients around. 

Today for example, his first client is 830am, he'll work until about 1230, pick up the toddler and bring her home until 530 and then drop her back off at the sitter again until 730 and then bring her home again and then go to his last client. 

While I appreciate the changes are made to accomidate my new schedule, it's completely fucked the morning routine. 

It used to be, wake up at 615am, pour the coffee, wake the husband, get the toddlers breakfast ready, grab her from her crib at 630-645am, she eats her breakfast and I pack her lunch. Clean her up, get her changed and her and husband are in the truck for 730. 

Now that he doesn't start until 830 most days it's all funky. He still wants to be woken up at 615 (not that he actually gets up at that point) but he basically lays there and does nothing until nearly 8am and then jumps up and gets dressed to go. 

So I went from usually, 1.5hr to myself after everyone's out the door to enjoy my coffee and find breakfast to like 30 minutes at best. 

That 1.5hrs was my only sliver of peace and me time and it's gone entirely.

I'll adapt but holy hell it's melting my brain.",2,1768394284.0,breakingmom,1,1.0,False

This feels a bit awkward to post, but I figured I’d give it a try.

I’m looking to make genuine friends here in the Netherlands. Ideally a small group, or even just one or two people I really click with. I’ve always felt a bit off-beat socially. Not in a dramatic way, just… not always aligned with the usual rhythms, which makes it harder to naturally fall into an existing friend group.
I really enjoy good conversations, curiosity, slightly weird humor, and people who are open-minded and kind. 

I’m into things like reading (romance and fantasy), photography, psychology, botany/nature, videogames (RPGs, Valo, OW2, etc), TTRPGs (D&D), Music / Concerts, Art & Creative writing (trying to write a fantasy romance novel) and lastly spirituality. Im sure I can surprise you with how much common interests we could have. 

I can be a little reserved at first, but once I’m comfortable I’m very present and loyal as a friend. Think: The emergency contact you'd call at 2am that would actually pick up when you need them. 

Small honest disclaimer, meant lightly: I seem to have a habit of becoming the “emotionally safe friend” and then completely missing any romantic subtext. So just to be clear, I’m genuinely looking for friendship here, not dating. Think conversations, shared interests, maybe meeting up for coffee, bookstore meetups, a few games of pool, gym session or walks, that kind of thing.

If this resonates with you and you’re also based in the Netherlands, feel free to comment or send a message. No pressure. Even a short conversation is fine.

Thanks for reading 🌱",3,1768393829.0,makenewfriendsNL,2,1.0,False

I’ve decided to dive into Blue Tokai and try their customize pack of 3. I want to sample a range of roast levels 1 dark, 1 medium, and 1 light, to understand how they differ.

So far my plan is:

* Dark: Dhak - I’ve heard good things and I want something bold.
* Medium: Silver Oak - feels like a safe and tasty middle ground.
* Light: TBD - I really want something fruity and vibrant.

I was thinking Raxidi Lobo for the light, but it looks like I can’t add it to the customize pack for some reason 😕.

I found these three interesting, but I am confused which one to try - 

* Sampigehoney Estate 
* Amruthavarshini Estate 
* Amaltas blend

For context, I'm a russian cradle from Europe. 

Recently, I was at an event organised by this one church I've been attending on and off for about half a year. Since I'm a little introverted, it's been hard for me to include myself into this community when at church, so I was glad when a young man there asked my number and didn't think much about it. But now he's asked me to have coffee with him and I don't know whether he's trying to ask me out on a date or just wants to connect. I have the suspicion that it's the former. 

I have made the experience that lots of young cradles here don't really take their faith very seriously. For my part, I personally am looking for marriage and am not interested in dating around or going into a relationship that doesn't have marriage, with Christ at it's center, as it's immediate goal. How do I convey something like that to someone who seems to be interested in me? I've never really had to have this conversation with someone as I've only gotten serious about my faith a little more than a year ago and haven't ""dated"" since. Do I have this conversation after we've met a couple times and it's clear that we're going into this dating direction? How does one even beginn a conversation like that? Or do I just drop it all after I realise that our mindsets don't allign after meeting? I just really don't want him to go into this with false expectations, if he's even after the whole dating thing, who knows.

1qclxdl,https://i.redd.it/hudvmupl5bdg1.jpeg,Please Help LG OLED G 4(webos25),"Hello, my name is Oskar and I have a big request for help. I kindly ask that at least one person take a deeper look into my problem — I’ll happily buy a coffee in return for the help, honestly 🤝.

I have an issue I’d like to ask you about. In general, I play on an Xbox Series X, mainly my beloved game FC 26. From the very beginning (September 2025), when the game was released, I discovered a bug in the game thanks to which the visuals looked incredibly good — until Saturday, when I accidentally updated webOS (my TV system was webOS 24, now it’s webOS 25).

TV: LG OLED G4.

Now I’ll explain how it worked:

During a match, I would enter the training arena, then using the Magic Remote, I would go into the LG OLED G4 TV settings, specifically into the brightness / picture panel

(the brightness itself wasn’t the key — the important part was simply entering the TV settings).

Then I would exit to the Xbox menu, directly to the game screenshots section. Under the screenshot on Xbox there is an option labeled “HDR” — I clicked on the HDR image.

The screen would reload to 4K and display the screenshot in extremely high quality. After that, I exited by pressing the B button twice on the controller, returning back to gameplay.

At that moment, everything looked much more three-dimensional. The grass was shimmering — you could almost say it looked like it was floating — and the players looked noticeably better.

Unfortunately, this effect is now gone.

And here is my question and request:

Could someone help me with this situation in any way?

I’m wondering whether it’s possible to roll back the TV software to the previous version. I know that normally this isn’t possible, but I believe you might be able to suggest how to do it — or how to achieve the same effect on the new software.

I tried using a USB drive with the officially downloaded webOS 24, but I’m not sure if I did something wrong. It’s possible that this bug still exists, but now it needs to be triggered in a different way.

Honestly, ChatGPT suggests that this may have been a bug / workaround in the HDR pipeline.",3,1768393437.0,LGOLED,1,1.0,False

1qclvn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindfullyDriven/comments/1qclvn0/how_to_crush_any_interview_the_sciencebased/,How to CRUSH Any Interview: The Science-Based Playbook That Actually Works,"so i used to be TERRIBLE at interviews. like sweating through my shirt, word-vomiting nonsense, leaving and immediately wanting to delete myself from existence type terrible. then i spent way too much time researching this (books, psychology podcasts, youtube deep dives, actual interview coaches) because i was tired of fumbling opportunities i was qualified for.

turns out most interview advice is garbage. the ""be yourself"" and ""just relax"" crowd clearly never bombed an interview so badly they considered faking their own death. but there's actually legit psychology and strategy behind crushing interviews that nobody talks about. this isn't about tricking anyone, it's about presenting your actual value without your anxiety sabotaging you.

1. reframe what an interview actually is

stop treating it like a test you can fail. it's a conversation between two parties trying to figure out mutual fit. they WANT you to be good. they're tired of interviewing people. hiring is expensive and annoying. you're potentially solving their problem

this mental shift alone changes everything. you're not begging for scraps, you're exploring whether this role deserves YOUR time and skills. sounds cocky but it genuinely makes you more attractive as a candidate because desperation is the most repellent thing you can project.

2. research like you're writing their biography

spend at least 2 hours researching before any interview. company website, recent news, their linkedin, glassdoor reviews, their competitors, industry trends. this isn't optional.

then do something most people skip: research the actual humans interviewing you. check their linkedin, see what they post about, find common ground. when you can naturally reference something specific in the interview (""i saw you used to work at X company, i'm really interested in how that industry compares to this one""), it shows effort and creates instant connection.

3. master the STAR method but make it not robotic

situation, task, action, result. for behavioral questions this structure is clutch but everyone uses it so mechanically that it sounds like they're reading a script.

practice your stories but tell them like you're explaining to a friend over coffee. add tiny human details. instead of ""i managed a team of 5 people,"" say ""i was managing this team of 5 and two of them were NOT getting along, like actively avoiding each other in meetings."" makes it real.

prepare 6-8 solid stories that cover different skills, leadership, problem solving, conflict, failure, innovation. you can remix these for most questions.

4. your ""tell me about yourself"" answer needs work

this is the most predictable question and people still mess it up. don't recite your resume. they have that. use this formula:

brief background (10 seconds), why you're passionate about this field (20 seconds), recent relevant accomplishment (20 seconds), why you're excited about THIS role (10 seconds).

should be under 90 seconds total. practice it until it sounds natural, not memorized.

5. flip the script with YOUR questions

at the end when they ask if you have questions, this is not a formality. this is where you either solidify their interest or reveal you don't actually care.

ask stuff that shows strategic thinking: ""what does success look like in this role after 6 months?"" ""what are the biggest challenges the team is facing right now?"" ""how does this role contribute to the company's main objectives this year?""

avoid anything you could google. no ""what does the company do"" type stuff

one killer question: ""is there anything about my background or experience that gives you concerns about my fit for this role?"" gives you a chance to address doubts in real time instead of wondering later what went wrong.

6. body language is doing half the talking

sit up straight but not weirdly rigid. make consistent eye contact (look away occasionally so you're not a psycho). smile when appropriate. nod while they're talking to show engagement.

match their energy somewhat. if they're more formal, dial yourself back. if they're relaxed and joking, you can loosen up too.

and for the love of god, don't fidget with pens or touch your face constantly. if you need something to do with your hands, rest them on the table or use small purposeful gestures when talking.

7. the pause is your friend

when they ask a tough question, it's completely fine to pause for 3-5 seconds before answering. shows you're thoughtful. rushed answers sound defensive or unprepared.

if you genuinely don't know something, don't try to BS your way through. ""that's not something i've dealt with directly, but here's how i'd approach it"" is way better than making up experience.

8. strategic vulnerability is powerful

when they ask about weaknesses (they will), pick something real but not disqualifying. then immediately talk about how you're actively working on it with specific examples.

""i used to struggle with delegating because i wanted everything done my way, but i've been intentionally giving team members more ownership and the results have actually been better than when i tried to control everything.""

shows self awareness and growth, not just humblebragging disguised as a weakness.

9. send the follow up email within 24 hour

short, specific, professional. thank them for their time, reference something specific from your conversation, reiterate your interest, keep it under 150 words.

this seems basic but tons of people skip it or send some generic template. personalization matters.

10. practice out loud with someone

reading interview tips is cool. actually practicing responses out loud is what makes you good. it feels awkward but it's the difference between knowing what to say and actually being able to say it under pressure.

get a friend to ask you common questions. record yourself on your phone. watch it back and cringe at your filler words and weird pauses. then do it again until it's smoother.

couple resources that actually helped: ""The Interview Question and Answer Book"" by James Reed is packed with practical frameworks, not just feel good nonsense. for understanding the psychology behind what interviewers are really assessing, Laszlo Bock's ""Work Rules!"" gives great insight (he was head of people operations at google for a decade).

there's also this youtube channel called ""A Life After Layoff"" that breaks down behavioral interview questions in a really practical way. the host is a former corporate recruiter so he knows what actually matters vs what's just noise.

if you want something more structured, there's an app called BeFreed that pulls insights from career development books, psychology research, and expert interviews to build personalized learning plans. you can tell it something like ""help me prepare for leadership interviews"" or ""improve my communication under pressure,"" and it creates an adaptive plan with podcasts customized to your depth preference, anywhere from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. the content connects a lot of the dots between books like the ones mentioned above, plus research on communication psychology and confidence building. worth checking out if you learn better by audio during commutes or workouts.

one last thing: you're gonna bomb interviews sometimes even when you do everything right. the fit wasn't there, someone internal got it, budget changed, whatever. doesn't mean you suck at interviews. means that specific thing wasn't meant to work out. review what you could improve and move forward.

but when you nail one, when you leave feeling like you just had an engaging conversation instead of a interrogation, when they're clearly impressed and you're genuinely excited about the role, that feeling is unmatched. interviews can actually be enjoyable once you stop seeing them as something to survive and start seeing them as a chance to showcase what you bring to the table.",1,1768393288.0,MindfullyDriven,0,1.0,False

I’m 18 and currently working as an apprentice grid electrician. I’ll be blunt: this job isn’t for me. I’ve learned a lot, but it’s just not giving me what I need on a mental, human, or professional level.

Over the past year, in my spare time, I’ve built an autonomous trading system based on AI agents from scratch. I’m not a ""classic"" programmer, a quant, or a guru. My main skill has been orchestrating AI models, getting them to reason together, testing, failing, and fixing. 
It’s what people are calling ""vibe coding"" right now, for better or worse.

My real interests are trading, AI, crypto, and markets. 
I want to understand how things actually work, not just talk about them.

I’ve reached a crossroads: my project, Leprechaun, is a solid asset, but it’s hard to turn it into a career while working full-time as an electrician. 

Staying where I am is driving me crazy and keeping me stagnant.

I’m not trying to be a ""wanna-be CEO"" or a senior dev, but I’m also done being the apprentice who just fetches coffee (which is what I’m doing now).

I’m looking for an environment where I can work on things I actually care about, learn from smart people, and bust my ass for something I want, not just out of duty. I also want to earn enough to be independent and not rely on my parents.

I’m hungry for real work, responsibility, and a challenge. I’m not running away from hard work, I’m just looking for the right kind of hard work.

My question is simple:
Do you think it’s realistic to look for a job in trading, fintech, or AI at my age and with my background, even without formal degrees? Or is it smarter to keep grinding on my own for a while longer?",1,1768393286.0,buildinpublic,2,1.0,False

I want to see if my eating schedule makes sense.  It worked for me 2 years ago and I lost a bunch of weight.  I stopped tracking and everything came back.  Any suggestions or advice?

Wake up at 5AM & have a black coffee

10AM - Usually eat breakfast which consists of a 1/2 cup cold oats (with almond milk) & Banana

1:30 Lunch - Usually Grilled Chicken, Chick Peas or other lean meats

5:15 PM Snack - 2 Hard boiled eggs, Greek Yogurt

6:30 PM - Dinner

8PM - Popcorn

9PM Bed

I am allowed 42 points a day, however I only use 22 of them.

Thoughts and or suggestions are much appreciated.",2,1768393254.0,weightwatchers,3,1.0,False
