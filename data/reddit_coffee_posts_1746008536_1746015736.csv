# APWORKS, Equispheres partner to produce high-performance aluminum-magnesium-scandium alloy for 3D printing.

In a move to strengthen North America's supply of advanced aerospace materials, APWORKS, an Airbus subsidiary specializing in metal 3D printing, and Equispheres, a Canadian aluminum powder producer, have partnered to establish regional production of Scalmalloy, a high-performance aluminum-magnesium-scandium alloy engineered for additive manufacturing.

Developed for laser powder bed fusion and critical applications demanding strength, weldability, and corrosion resistance, Scalmalloy bridges the gap between traditional aerospace-grade metals and next-generation manufacturing technologies.

Until now, the alloy's availability has been largely limited to Europe and Asia, creating supply challenges for North American manufacturers looking to accelerate additive production.

Eliminating one of the final barriers to adoption, the newest partnership will see Equispheres produce Scalmalloy powder optimized for 3D printing from primarily domestic raw materials – a move designed to support aerospace, defense, and industrial users seeking faster, more reliable access to high-performance alloys.

The company's proprietary powder technology, designed for high uniformity and print speed without compromising mechanical integrity, will bring new scalability to a material prized for its combination of strength and lightweight performance.

""Scalmalloy will be a great addition to our line of high-performance materials for serial additive manufacturing,"" said Equispheres CEO Kevin Nicholds. ""North American supply of critical materials such as aluminum-scandium alloys is a key step toward securing the aerospace supply chain.""

Long overlooked due to its scattered distribution, scandium remains difficult to produce at scale despite being more abundant in Earth's crust than lead – a constraint that has kept global output low and supply chains heavily dependent on Chinese, Russian, and Kazakh sources.

[New recovery efforts in Canada](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2024/09/16/critical-minerals-alliances-2024/north-america-fortifies-scandium-supply/1936.html), however, are beginning to shift that balance – momentum that partnerships like APWORKS and Equispheres are now positioned to accelerate.

""Equispheres is a logical choice for expanding Scalmalloy production into North America,"" said APWORKS CEO Jonathan Meyer. ""Their expertise in producing high-quality aluminum powders for additive manufacturing, combined with access to domestic aluminum and scandium sources, positions them well for building supply chain resilience.""

[A bionic cabin partition created by Airbus, Autodesk, and APWORKS illustrates how Scalmalloy and generative design deliver lightweight, load-bearing aerospace structures.](https://preview.redd.it/x35ytjhojyxe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=e65646d5a23cb94fbc68d73302eb5637ae516932)

Beyond raw availability, domestic production of Scalmalloy streamlines qualification and part certification processes by reducing lead times and material variability – factors that often limit implementation in regulated aerospace and defense systems. Powder produced to North American specifications can be aligned more directly with design, testing, and production schedules.

Equispheres' process yields spherical, size-controlled powder engineered for consistent flow and packing density. These properties support faster build rates, reduced defect occurrence, and tighter dimensional accuracy – factors essential to scaling metal additive manufacturing in aerospace, propulsion, and satellite component production.

As global supply chains evolve to prioritize regional production of strategic materials, the APWORKS–Equispheres partnership aligns with broader Western initiatives to secure alloy inputs for aircraft, defense platforms, and industrial systems. Scalmalloy's entry into North American production adds a flight-proven, data-supported material to the region's additive manufacturing infrastructure.

Already validated in Formula 1 racing and aerospace prototypes, Scalmalloy delivers the structural performance – high tensile strength, fatigue resistance, corrosion durability – required for next-generation manufacturing.

# NioCorp Partnering with Nanoscale Powders LLC to Explore the Possibility of Establishing the First US-Based Mine-to-Master-Alloy Vertically Integrated Production of the High-Performance Material

***NioCorp’s Potential Commercial Production of Al-Sc Master Alloy Could Launch Prior to the Company’s Planned Production of >100 Tonnes/Year of Scandium Oxide at its Proposed Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project in Nebraska and Would Use Scandium Produced at the Elk Creek Facility as well as From Other Sources***

***China Now Dominates the Scandium World, but North America is Now Positioned to Emerge as a “Leading Scandium Producer,” says NioCorp CEO***

**CENTENNIAL, Colo. (May 29, 2023) – NioCorp Developments Ltd. (“NioCorp” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:NB) (TSX:NB) today announced its intent to launch a phased approach to commercial-scale production of aluminum-scandium (“Al-Sc”) master alloy in the US for commercial and defense applications.  Coupled with the Company’s intended plans to produce more than 100 tonnes per year of scandium oxide from its proposed Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project (the “Elk Creek Project”) in southeast Nebraska, and depending upon the results of the Al-Sc master alloy initiative, receipt of necessary funding and other factors, the initiative could establish the US as a leading producer of scandium, according to NioCorp CEO and Executive Chairman Mark A Smith.**

**Under an exclusive agreement with Boston-based Nanoscale Powders LLC (“Nanoscale”) the initial work is expected to result in the production of several ingots of Al-Sc master alloy at potentially commercial amounts of scandium content using a proprietary process developed by Nanoscale that increases efficiency and reduces environmental impacts of Al-Sc production over traditional approaches.**

# >ON ~MAY, 26th 2023~Trying to get a handle on REE's I asked Jim to comment on the following: We have the NI43-101 report stating pounds in the ground and recent news (as mentioned below) stating 92% recoveries.

***NioCorp’s Rare Earth Demonstration Plant Showing Strong Rare Earth Recovery Results, in Line with Expectationshttps://www.niocorp.com/niocorps-rare-earth-demonstration-plant-showing-strong-rare-earth-recovery-results-in-line-with-expectations/***

*JIM - What I’m trying to deduce is final tonnage/output. Early on Scott mentioned expected over 750 tons per year of REE.* *Can you offer comment:*

**\*\*RESPONSE**

# ""REE separations extraction of the individual elements will result in only about a 1% further reduction in the overall REE recovery rate we have already demonstrated for extracting the REEs from solution as a group, as SX it is a very efficient process and our folks have years of experience of doing this kind of REE separation and purification at commercial scale. Thus, it is safe to assume at this point that total REE recovery rate from ore to final separated product will be around 92%. This is about the same as our scandium recovery rate, which is not surprising given that Scandium behaves just like the other REEs in solution.""

# ""NioCorp has not made a final determination on which REE products we will make, including tonnages, etc.. That determination can only be made in the context of publication of an updated Feasibility Study.""   >>>>(THE NEW FINAL DEFINITIVE 2025 F.S. IS NOW UNDERWAY!!!!)<<<<<

# Consortium secures UK funding to create low-carbon alloys using recycled aluminum strengthened by scandium.

In a significant move toward sustainable automotive manufacturing, an industry consortium including Aston Martin, Boeing UK, and NioCorp Developments Ltd. has secured approximately $3.8 million in UK funding to develop lightweight aluminum alloys and cast components using recycled aluminum strengthened by scandium.

This collaborative initiative, dubbed Project Pivot (Performance Integrated Vehicle Optimization Technology), involves leading automotive manufacturers, material scientists, and academic institutions.

The two main objectives of the project are to enhance vehicle component performance and reduce environmental impact by using recycled materials. Participants include Aston Martin, Jaguar Land Rover, Sarginsons, Altair, GESCRAP, and Brunel University London, all aiming to merge engineering innovation with sustainable manufacturing practices.

The project's steering committee, which features key players such as Boeing UK, Linamar, Alcon Industries, and Shell Re-Charge, is responsible for guiding its strategic direction.

Together, they are working toward developing low-carbon vehicle components through the integration of recycled aluminum, which reduces carbon intensity significantly compared to traditional production methods.

As part of this $8 million program, Coventry-based aluminum foundry Sarginsons leads the charge, having already secured $3.8 million in UK government funding via the Advanced Propulsion Centre (APC) following a competitive application process. The consortium members will provide the remaining funding needed to achieve the initiative's goals.

""The award of funding from the APC is a major boost to Project PIVOT, which seeks to leverage advanced metal solidification and digital-twin simulations to manufacture low-carbon alloys which will ultimately uplift the level of recycled content we feature in Aston Martin models,"" said Roberto Fedeli, group chief technology officer of Aston Martin. ""We look forward to progressing this project collaboratively with Sarginsons and our other research partners.""

NioCorp's role is to provide [aluminum-scandium master alloy](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2023/08/16/mining-tech/niocorp-produces-scandium-metal-in-us/1419.html) for the group's research and prototype parts development efforts.

By harnessing scandium's unique combination of lightness and strength, the initiative aims to enable innovative designs in automotive engineering and aligns with broader industry trends that prioritize decarbonization and the creation of materials that enhance fuel efficiency while maintaining safety and durability.

""Project Pivot is aimed at solving real-world challenges and doing so on an accelerated timeline that happens to line up very well with NioCorp's plans to come online with approximately 100 tonnes per year of U.S.-produced scandium oxide from our Elk Creek Project in Nebraska,"" said NioCorp COO Scott Honan. ""By almost any measure, the automotive industry has the potential to consume many hundreds of tonnes per year of scandium, and NioCorp will remain focused on supplying the scandium that this large potential market demands.""

# A DEEP DIVE INTO SCANDIUM & SCANDIUM ALUIMINUM RECYCLING:

# 🔍 Background: Why Add Scandium to Aluminum?

Adding **scandium** (even in very small amounts, like 0.1%–0.5%) to aluminum:

* **Refines grain structure** during solidification.
* Improves **strength**, **ductility**, and **corrosion resistance**.
* Enables **weldable high-strength alloys** (e.g., for 3D printing or structural aerospace parts).

Projects like **PIVOT** (UK) and **NioCorp** (USA) are working on improving scandium supply chains and integrating its use into aluminum production economically.

# ⚙️ How the Process Works (Industrial Overview)

Here’s the simplified production flow of an **aluminum-scandium alloy**:

1. **Scandium Source**: Scandium is extracted from minerals (like from NioCorp’s Elk Creek project) or recovered as a byproduct from other metal production.
2. **Scandium Master Alloy Production**: Scandium is alloyed with aluminum (typically 2% Sc in Al) to form a **master alloy**, e.g., Al-2%Sc.
3. **Alloying Process**: This master alloy is added in small amounts to bulk aluminum during melting.
4. **Casting/Forming**: The scandium-modified aluminum is cast and can be further processed (rolled, extruded, or 3D-printed).
5. **Heat Treatment (optional)**: Aging may be applied to precipitate **Al₃Sc particles**, improving mechanical properties.
6. **End Use**: The alloy is used in aerospace, defense, EVs, etc.

# ✅ ECHO Process Model for Scandium-Aluminum Alloying

Here’s a simplified **ECHO-style breakdown** (ECHO = **Explore → Create → Harness → Optimize**):

# 🔎 Explore (Understanding the Materials and Needs)

* Identify the **mechanical and corrosion weaknesses** in current Al alloys.
* Research scandium's effects on **grain refinement and precipitation hardening**.
* Explore existing supply chain challenges (e.g., Project PIVOT’s aim to secure sustainable scandium).

# ⚙️ Create (Formulation of Scandium-Aluminum Alloys)

* Develop **Al-Sc master alloys** (typically Al-2%Sc).
* Introduce the master alloy into molten Al during casting or powder metallurgy.
* Use **thermodynamic modeling** to predict phase behavior and optimize Sc addition (e.g., <0.5%).

# 💡 Harness (Processing & Industrial Application)

* Cast or powder-print alloy into components.
* Use **age-hardening heat treatments** to form Al₃Sc precipitates.
* Apply alloy in **lightweight, high-performance applications** (aerospace frames, hydrogen tanks, EV structures).

# 🔧 Optimize (Sustainable, Scalable Deployment)

* Improve scandium extraction from primary and secondary sources (e.g., rare earth tailings).
* Minimize cost through process optimization (e.g., reducing required Sc content).
* Develop recycling protocols for scandium-bearing aluminum.

# 🌍 Projects Mentioned:

* **Project PIVOT (UK)**: Focused on creating a UK-based rare earth supply chain, including scandium.
* **NioCorp (USA)**: Developing scandium production as a byproduct of its niobium and rare earth project in Nebraska.

# 🧪 Research and Development Initiatives

Several organizations are actively involved in developing scandium-aluminum alloys:

# 1. NioCorp Developments Ltd. (USA)

In temperate climates, we have booked university classrooms, or nonprofit work rooms. Now looking at Da Nang as a destination, maybe we should think differently. I'm seeing beachside lounges (restaurants, bars in My An) that are open all day.  We could also book a hotel if they had coffee lounge space where we could hang out for most of the day. 

Two couches facing each other, or a few chairs in a circle would be okay. A table we could sit around with laptops, with wifi available, would be better. 

Coworking spaces seem to only offer one meeting room. If we did find more meeting rooms, I'm not sure if the community would appreciate locking up the space for a week. 

Should we be thinking about not trapping people indoors for a work week?  With a place that offers coffee and/or food, we would be prepared to pay. Alternatively, if there's a hotel with patio (covered, against sun and rain), we could stay there.

In America you have the right to vote for the candidate you think will help make things better in this country. These media pundits and other cultural and religious figures have no right to decide if your good or evil based on who you voted for.

I say this because many have seen how many people voted for Trump 7 months ago and said ""you just wanted cheaper gas."" or ole reliable ""they're all racist fascists"". The problem is they're making the most basic and superficial yet extreme assumptions instead of, oh, I don't friggin know, asking them why they voted?! 

This pisses me off because most of my extended family are conservatives who helped my parents raise me and helped me when I was going through the worst time of my life 4 years ago, especially my aunt who owns a charity coffee shop and helped addicts and the homeless.

And Fox News and OAN are EQUALLY to blame. They assume genuine liberals like my mom and dad voted Kamala because they are offended snowflakes who want to destroy America or white people or they want free college like those antifa goons. That's BS too.

My parents only voted because they thought Trump was unhinged and where worried he and Elon would cut off my disability check and food stamps. I know I had my food stamps cut but to be brutally honest I don't care what happens to me I care about babies being aborted, I care about government corruption and waste/fraud, I care about free speech, I care about far left extremism and I don't want us in any more war where our soldiers come home maimed like my friend David. I would rather go hungry than have all this crap happen (that and I'm 334 Lbs)

When the Kieth Olbermanns and Tucker Carlsons of the nation tell you your scum becuase of your vote, your race, your faith, or any other born trait or your conscience, that is unamerican. If they don't like it they can piss off to North Korea.

""But dont Trump/Kamala say/do unamerican things all the time?"" Absolutely! But our electoral process and our capitalist overlords incessantly force us to pick between two stupid choices by Election Day. If we want to fix this, we have to fix the system.

The rain poured heavily at night, and dark clouds shrouded the city. Olivia stood in the rain before Carter Manor, looking at the tall, lanky man before her. He stood under the porch, his deep, dark eyes as cloudy as the night sky outside. His eyes gleamed with indescribable emotions as he looked at the disheveled Olivia.  
  
After a moment, he took out a bank card and a plane ticket from his pocket and threw them at her. He said coldly and ruthlessly, ""Leave Carter Manor and never come back!"" With that, he turned and went into the house.  
  
Olivia watched him while shivering. She had always known that Nathan hated her! Her heart felt empty, and she felt chills as the rain beat down on her fiercely. She took her few belongings after some time and turned to leave miserably.  
  
There was a crack in the curtains of a bedroom on the second-floor. Nathan watched the thin figure gradually disappear in the heavy rain. His fists clenched tightly at his sides, and he punched the window...  
  
Emma stood at the door with a glass of warm water. She wanted to come in, but she unexpectedly witnessed this scene instead. A cold, bitter expression flashed in her eyes! She resented that Nathan had given Olivia money to send her abroad. *Why is he still secretly watching her from a distance in the study? Olivia is such a lowly wench. What's so good about her?* A slightly cruel expression surfaced in Emma's eyes...  
  
Half an hour later, Olivia walked ahead in a daze on a dark, empty street while dragging her luggage. A motorcycle suddenly roared from a distance, snatching away what little belongings she had left. After Olivia fell to the ground, she was dragged and rolled a few times. As she felt a sharp pain, her vision went black. Darkness completely enveloped her, and she entirely lost consciousness!  
  
Five years later, a graceful figure sat in the general manager's office at Horizon Ventures' headquarters in Germany. She had delicate features, and she carefully swept her eyes over the documents in her hand as she sat at a top-notch, African redwood desk. She worked efficiently as she scanned through multiple lines of words effortlessly.  
  
A faint sandalwood fragrance lingered in the air, and a cup of coffee was beside her. She was in a limited edition haute couture suit that outlined her slender figure. It had just debuted at Paris Fashion Week.  
  
With her hair pulled into a high bun, she looked somewhat relaxed yet experienced. She had makeup on, and she looked very charming. Although beautiful, elegant, and dignified, she was also aloof and unapproachable. She wasn't one to be messed with!  
  
At this moment, there was a sudden knock on the door. Olivia's assistant, Benjamin Hayes, hurriedly entered and said anxiously, ""Something's wrong, Ms. Olivia. William has run away from home again!"" Olivia frowned at him, sounding slightly displeased. ""Why are you panicking? It's not his first time running away. He'll return soon!""  
  
""It's not..."" Benjamin stomped his foot in frustration. ""This time is different. He went abroad and even took Mr. Valtor with him!""  
  
""What did you say?"" Olivia's face turned cold as she put down the documents in her hand. ""Where did they go?""  
  
""They went to Emberfall in Wirthon,"" Benjamin quickly replied and handed his phone to Olivia. Two dots blinked on the screen, marking Liam's current coordinates! ""Does William think he's invincible?"" Olivia had an unpleasant expression. She immediately took out her phone to call Liam.  
  
An automated voice quickly rang on the phone. ""Sorry, the number you have dialed is currently unavailable..."" Olivia was dumbstruck. Her eyes darkened, and she had a cloudy expression. *Why did they go to Emberfall? What is that kid up to?*



**Chapter 2 The Child's Blackmail**



Her mind whirled for a moment before she said calmly, ""Book a plane ticket and bring him back immediately.""  
  
""Alright,"" Benjamin answered and left.  
  
At that moment, the young Liam sat in a café across the towering, imposing Carter Group in the city of Emberfall in Wirthon. The child sat by the window, swinging his legs leisurely. A laptop was in front of him, displaying a dazzling array of code on screen. Mr. Valtor sat beside the boy and looked at him in admiration.  
  
It was rumored that Carter Group had the safest security system in the world. Ordinary hackers couldn't breach their defenses at all. But now, William was treating it like child's play as he silently breached each layer of defense. The boy was only a little over four years old but extraordinarily smart!  
  
'Ding.' At this moment, the web page showed that Liam had successfully breached the system. ""Yay, done!"" Liam cheered happily and clapped. Mr. Valtor leaned over. ""You're so fast!""  
  
""Of course! Mommy taught me this system. It can even breach Xenava's defenses. Although Carter Group has powerful defenses, it can't stop me!"" the boy said proudly. He slid off the chair, picked up his small backpack at the side, and walked away after saying, ""Mr. Valtor, wait for my good news. I'm going to find my dad!""  
  
""Go for it! All the best!"" Mr. Valtor trusted the boy's ability and wasn't worried about him.  
  
Liam quickly crossed the street and entered Carter Group. Once inside, he headed to the president's private elevator, which required a fingerprint and passcode. He felt a faint anticipation as he went forward to crack the software.  
  
*I'll be able to meet Daddy soon! I* *wonder if Daddy will be surprised or happy to see me!* Lost in thought, he successfully cracked the password. He eagerly stepped into the elevator, slowly ascending to the top floor.  
  
Nathan had just finished three conference calls in the meeting room on the top floor and was massaging the bridge of his nose wearily. His refined brows were slightly furrowed, and he had an unpleasant expression. His devilishly handsome face looked even colder than usual.  
  
His assistant, Ethan Thompson, handed him the materials for the next meeting and asked concernedly, ""Mr. Carter, don't you want to take a break?"" The company had been busy lately, and Nathan was a workaholic. When he was swamped, he worked tirelessly like a machine. As Nathan's right-hand man, Ethan was also working round the clock. He felt like he didn't even have time to catch his breath!  
  
Nathan took the documents, waved his hand, and said coldly, ""No need!"" He had meetings all day today, including two global conferences in the evening. He didn't have time to rest. Ethan was dumbstruck and could only continue working helplessly.  
  
At that moment, the conference room door opened. Nathan's secretary, Fiona Agers, came in, flustered. She reported, ""Mr.… Mr. Carter, there's a child outside who wants to see you. He said... he's your son."" Nathan hated to be disturbed while working. He was highly displeased by how his secretary had burst in anxiously. Moreover, what she said was so absurd. Nathan's face darkened almost instantly.  
  
Ethan was also briefly stunned. He berated Fiona. ""Ms. Agers, what nonsense are you talking about?"" *Mr. Carter isn't even married. How can he have a son?* ""I... I..."" Fiona trembled with fear and dared not speak. However, a small figure emerged behind her, his shiny eyes looking at the people in the room.  
  
His gaze quickly locked onto Nathan, and he ran over excitedly. ""I found you! This is great. Daddy... we finally met!"" The little boy pounced on Nathan and tightly wrapped his arms around the man's legs, beaming.  
  
Nathan was dumbstruck. He gazed at the child dangling from his leg and was stunned. He didn't know how to react. Ethan's eyelids twitched, and he instinctively wanted to pull the child away. His boss wasn't fond of strangers touching him. However, his hand froze mid-air when he saw the child's face.  
  
The young child had delicate, refined features. His cheeks were soft and supple, and his dark eyes were as bright as the stars in the night sky. His dazzling, animated gaze made him look lively yet wise beyond his years. His appearance surprisingly resembled Nathan!  
  
Ethan was somewhat perplexed and astonished. ""Mr. Carter, this..."" Nathan finally snapped back to reality when he heard it. His brows furrowed, and he was utterly displeased. ""Why are you just standing there? Get rid of him! Make his parents come to collect him. Who brought him here? Throw him out at once!""  
  
""Ah... Alright!"" Ethan was surprised, but he came to his senses and felt like his rational self again. *Mr. Carter has no interest in women. He's very self-restrained. How could he have a child? I must've been out of my mind to think this is Mr. Carter's son!*  
  
Ethan moved forward quickly to pick the boy up. ""Boy, where are your family members? You can't play here! Come on, I'll take you out..."" The child unexpectedly held on tighter to Nathan's pant leg. He shook his head and said, ""I'm not leaving. Nathan Carter is my Daddy! It hasn't been easy to find Daddy...""  
  
The boy seemed slightly aggrieved. He looked at Nathan's cold expression and spoke in a babyish voice. ""Daddy, my name is William Monroe. You can call me Liam. I'm four years and three months old! I'm your biological son! I did a DNA test. Take a look if you don't believe me."" As he spoke, he let go and swiftly retrieved a piece of paper from his backpack before handing it over.  
  
Nathan didn't reach out to take it. He found it absurd that a child had inexplicably appeared out of nowhere and claimed to be his son! His expression grew colder, and the surrounding temperature dropped several degrees.  
  
Ethan felt a shiver run down his spin. He couldn't help but think to himself. *What an elaborate scam. This boy is so good at blackmail. He even provided DNA evidence. It must be fake, right?* Ethan quickly glanced at the document out of suspicion. To his surprise, Nathan's information was accurate, including his blood type and age. The probability of paternity was 99.9 percent!



**Chapter 3 Speak with Me in Person**



""Mr. Carter, please take a look at this!"" Ethan was instantly shocked. He quickly took the document and handed it to Nathan, who said impatiently, ""Stop wasting time!""  
  
""No, this... document seems legit!"" Ethan's heart constricted as he explained hastily. Nathan frowned, and he glanced at it coldly and quickly identified the legitimacy of the information. It was authentic! But he still couldn't believe the boy was his child.  
  
""Who helped you falsify this DNA? And where did you get this information from?"" Nathan's face turned cold as he scrutinized the little boy before him sharply. Liam wasn't afraid at all. He replied earnestly, ""I didn't fake it. I investigated the information myself! What's wrong with that?""  
  
Nathan narrowed his eyes as if trying to determine if the boy was lying. Something suddenly flashed through his mind. *Hold on...* *This child is four years and three months old, and his last name is Monroe!* As he recalled the last five years, the only woman he had ever been with was... Nathan suddenly felt uneasy! He stood up abruptly, his voice slightly constricted as if feeling uneasy. ""You said... your last name is Monroe? What is your mom's name?""  
  
""Mommy's name is Olivia Monroe,"" Liam replied honestly in a childish voice. Nathan was briefly stunned, his face in disbelief. ""You... Repeat it. What is her name?""  
  
""Olivia Monroe. Daddy, don't you know who Mommy is?"" Liam looked at Nathan slightly dejectedly. Nathan didn't respond, but his heart raced violently. Even his fingers trembled a little! *Olivia Monroe! It's been five years! You're finally back after disappearing for five years!*  
  
Ethan was equally surprised when he heard this name. He knew who Olivia was! He also knew she had disappeared after being kicked out of Carter Manor five years ago! Nathan had almost turned every inch of Europe upside down in the past five years but couldn't find her. He never expected that she would return with a child this way...  
  
After processing it for a moment, Nathan finally accepted the news. His expression was still cold and slightly hostile! ""Where is your mommy? Did she send you to look for me?""   
  
*If you can hide for five years, why not just hide forever?*  
  
Liam shook his head. ""Mommy doesn't know. I secretly returned to the country to look for you..."" He hesitated briefly. ""But Mommy should have found out, so she must be coming after me. Daddy, you must protect me. Mommy will punish me!"" After saying this, he threw himself into Nathan's arms.  
  
Nathan was still angry, but something in his heart stirred after the child hugged him. His hostile demeanor vanished entirely, and his expression softened unconsciously. He asked, ""You said you secretly returned to the country? Did you come alone?""  
  
""No, I didn't. I initially planned to come by myself, but the airport doesn't allow children to travel alone, so I brought Mr. Valtor!"" Speaking of Mr. Valtor, the boy suddenly remembered that he was waiting downstairs, so he asked, ""Daddy, can Mr. Valtor come up? He's at the café across from the office!""  
  
Nathan didn't object. He picked up his son and instructed Ethan, ""Bring him up! And cancel all my meetings today.""   
  
Ethan acknowledged his instructions and quickly left the room!  
  
Meanwhile, Olivia was on her way to the country, feeling restless as she wondered about the purpose of Liam's visit. When she finally arrived the following morning, she immediately called Liam when the plane landed. At that moment, Liam was already awake. Mr. Valtor was helping him wash up and get dressed as usual.  
  
Nathan stood at the side and asked Mr. Valtor, ""Do you usually care for Liam?"" He feigned a nonchalant tone, but it was slightly probing. He wanted to learn more about the child and perhaps even the woman.  
  
However, Mr. Valtor was very tactful. He knew exactly what to say and what to keep private. ""Ms. Olivia is very busy with work, but she still manages to spend time with William daily."" Nathan nodded. He wanted to ask more questions when the phone suddenly rang.  
  
When Liam glanced at it, he was instantly startled. Mr. Valtor was also surprised, and he glanced at Nathan hesitantly. Nathan immediately knew who was calling. His jaw clenched, and he said coldly, ""Answer the phone."" However, he had no intention of leaving!  
  
Liam didn't dare answer, so he handed the phone to Mr. Valtor, who braced himself and answered the call. Olivia's voice rang loudly on the other end. ""William Monroe! You have three seconds to tell me where you are right now!"" Her voice was piercing, and Nathan heard it clearly. It was indeed that woman's voice! His eyes flickered, but he remained composed.  
  
""Ms. Olivia, it... it's me,"" Mr. Valtor spoke cautiously. Olivia was furious and yelled, ""Where is William Monroe, that little brat? Why didn't he answer the phone? Mr. Valtor, why did you play along when Liam was reckless and immature? You went to another country without saying anything! Don't you know how worried I'd be? Where are you now? Come to the hotel immediately and meet me!""  
  
Mr. Valtor glanced at Liam instinctively. The little boy shook his head vigorously. It was evident that he didn't want to leave. Mr. Valtor spoke bluntly with a pained expression. ""Ms. Olivia, William... found his dad, and we're currently at Carter Manor!""  
  
Olivia was dumbstruck. Even though she had much to say, she was suddenly speechless. Although she had suspicions, her mind couldn't help but reel upon hearing the truth. It was just as she had suspected! Liam had come to look for Nathan!  
  
She had inadvertently mentioned Nathan's existence a few months ago, and the little boy had become fixated on it! That's why he had made such a long journey to the country! And now, Nathan was aware of Liam's existence... Just the thought of this made it hard for Olivia to breathe.  
  
The humiliation of being expelled from Carter Manor years ago still lingered vividly. Time had passed, and she had grown indifferent, but deep down, she honestly didn't want to be involved with the Carter family any further.  
  
Olivia took a deep breath. She suppressed her tumultuous emotions and ordered, ""Mr. Valtor, bring Liam back immediately. I won't repeat myself."" Mr. Valtor sensed the determination in her tone. He understood that there must have been unresolved issues between her and Nathan.  
  
Mr. Valtor was at fault for sneaking William out. He hesitated momentarily and was about to respond when Nathan's deep, icy voice rang first. ""Tell her that if she wants to take Liam away, she must come and speak with me in person!"" His voice was soft, but Olivia heard it clearly.



**Chapter 4 She Shouldn't Even Be Alive**



Olivia's breath caught in her throat. This voice had haunted her dreams countless times. Whenever she heard the voice call her name, it was colder and more ruthless than the last. It sent a chill down her spine when she heard it in person. After a brief silence, she said icily, ""I have every right to take my child away. There's no need to speak.""  
  
""Heh. Is that so?"" Nathan's voice was frosty. He sneered. ""In that case, you won't be seeing Liam again. After all… he's my child too!"" With that, he snatched Mr. Valtor's phone and hung up.  
  
Olivia felt her limbs numb as the dial tone rang in her ear. She didn't want to face Nathan, but he used Liam to blackmail her. *Is he still unwilling to let me go? It makes sense. He hates my parents and me.* Even after all these years, he still believed she owed the Carter family her life.  
  
But she was only seven years old back then. She had lost her parents, and her relatives had shunned and abandoned her. The Carter family had even humiliated her and labeled her as the daughter of a murderer. She became an orphan, but the family also made her feel like a criminal who shouldn't even be alive.  
  
The heartless expulsion from Carter Manor five years ago had pushed Olivia to the brink of death multiple times. She felt that she no longer owed the Carter family anything. Now, with Nathan trying to take her precious son away, she couldn't just stand by and do nothing.  
  
Olivia's expression turned slightly cold. Her turbulent emotions quickly simmered into a calm resolve. She instructed Benjamin, ""Let's go."" She would go personally and speak to him. She had nothing to fear.  
  
The two swiftly hailed a cab and made their way to Beverly Hills. Forty minutes later, they were greeted by Nathan's private residence after arriving. It was a serene oasis amidst the bustling city, a favored spot for the affluent and renowned. The courtyard gates provided residents with much-needed privacy.  
  
When Olivia exited the vehicle, she saw the large, intricate, openwork iron gates standing tall at thirteen to sixteen feet, looking exquisite and imposing. It led into a spacious courtyard adorned with a grand fountain and meticulously crafted greenery. Further ahead loomed the opulent, palace-style building.  
  
Every detail here was so familiar that it was etched into Olivia's memory. Her blood ran cold, and her heart felt like it had stopped beating. It felt constricted, and she almost couldn't catch her breath.  
  
Memories of that fateful night five years ago flooded her mind uncontrollably. The rainy night, the insults, the humiliation, her pleas, and… the man's callous figure. Her heart raced as she stood frozen in place. She didn't ring the doorbell.  
  
It was then that a black Bentley slowly pulled up beside her… Emma had arrived early for breakfast with Nathan. As she approached Carter Manor's gates, she noticed two figures standing there, one of whom seemed vaguely familiar.  
  
She assumed they were guests, so she didn't think too much about it. She stopped the car, rolled down the window, and inquired, ""Are you here to see Nathan?"" Olivia snapped back to reality at the sound of Emma's voice. She turned and looked straight into Emma's eyes.  
  
Emma was utterly taken aback! She immediately recognized Olivia and was in disbelief. She looked like she had seen a ghost. ""Are you... Olivia Monroe?"" she asked, as if seeking confirmation. An indescribable panic gripped her. *Olivia is back! Isn't she supposed to be missing?!*  
  
After Emma had orchestrated that car accident, Olivia vanished without a trace. It had been five years since she disappeared, and Emma had assumed she would never see Olivia again. Hence, she pursued the man she desired with a clear conscience.  
  
But Emma never expected Olivia to return! Here she was, standing at Carter Manor's gates early in the morning. *Does Nathan already know she's back?* Emma was in shock as her mind raced with questions. Her emotions reached a boiling point as her expression darkened. She stepped out of the car and walked towards Olivia, her eyes filled with disdain. ""Olivia Monroe, it's been a while! How do you have the nerve to come back?""



**Chapter 5 Reunited**



In the same way, Olivia also never expected to encounter Emma here. This woman had matured significantly. Emma was still elegant, but she was also more arrogant. She spoke haughtily, just like before! Olivia felt disgusted and knew there was no point in saying much. She stepped back and said coldly, ""We don't know each other very well. Please maintain your distance!""  
  
""You..."" Emma was momentarily speechless, her expression turning sour. She also couldn't help but notice that Olivia was different from before. The Olivia of the past was a humble servant in the Carter family. She was always clad in worn-out attire and performed menial tasks.  
  
But now, she was dressed in a mature and elegant outfit. She appeared refined and sophisticated, exuding confidence and poise from the inside out. It was as though she were a completely different person, transforming from Cinderella to an aloof queen! Emma even felt slightly intimidated by her gaze!  
  
Emma was taken aback yet annoyed, her words unkind. ""Oh, are you putting on airs now? It's been five years, and you've certainly changed. I recall when you didn't even have the right to speak in my presence, but you carry yourself so virtuously now. It appears you've fared well these years..."" As Emma spoke, she touched the corner of Olivia's outfit. ""Look at your outfit. You're wearing nicer clothes than before!""  
  
Olivia's gaze turned sharp. She grabbed Emma's wrist and applied much pressure, nearly fracturing Emma's bone. ""Since you know I'm wearing nicer clothes than before, refrain from touching it. You can't afford it!"" Olivia retorted, shaking off Emma's arm as if Emma were dirty.  
  
Emma felt incredulous! As the Patel family's daughter and the Carter family's future daughter-in-law, she was accustomed to getting her way. But now, a destitute former servant was taunting her, claiming she couldn't afford an outfit.  
  
Emma was unaware that Olivia had designed her own one-of-a-kind outfit, and she made nastier remarks out of anger. ""So, you've found yourself a benefactor... Could it be the gentleman beside you?"" Her gaze shifted to Benjamin standing beside Olivia. With his striking, refined appearance, Benjamin looked very handsome and dignified next to Olivia. Emma had already noticed him, and she mistakenly assumed him to be Olivia's bankroller.  
  
Benjamin raised his brows. He didn't deny what Emma said. However, he felt great disdain for Emma's baseless accusations. *Foolish woman!* Scorn and contempt flickered in his eyes! Olivia said bluntly, ""Is it any of your business?""  
  
Convinced of her assumption, Emma's contempt for Olivia grew. ""Very well. I have nothing further to say to someone like you. Just a word of advice, since you've left the Carter family, exercise prudence and keep your distance! I'm set to be engaged to Nathan next month and prefer not to have any unwanted interference."" She deliberately emphasized the last few words, feeling proud and pleased.  
  
Olivia was stunned. She acted like she had heard something amusing and responded, ""I lead a busy life and do not indulge in leisurely pursuits! But since you've spoken, allow me to offer my congratulations!"" Emma was taken aback, caught off guard by Olivia's unexpected reaction.  
  
At that moment, the villa's gates opened with a clang, drawing Olivia and Emma's attention to a figure in the courtyard whose presence had gone unnoticed.   
  
The man wore a sleek black suit. His shirt was buttoned to the collar. His long legs made him look like an international supermodel. He had a refined yet enigmatic countenance, his demeanor cold and aloof. His thin lips were flattened, making him look indifferent and detached. His dark eyes were devoid of warmth, and he had an icy presence. The temperature around him seemed to plummet several degrees, making everyone else shiver!",1,1746014876.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1kbesxo,https://youtu.be/f9-6yJxRaqs,3 Very Scary TRUE Campers Saved by Technology Horror Stories,"**“Flooded Out: The Night East Leichhardt Dam Tried to Swallow Us”:**

That night at East Leichhardt Dam—it’s burned into my memory with the kind of clarity that only real fear brings. March 2024. What was meant to be a laid-back camping weekend turned into a flood-soaked nightmare. No ghosts, no monsters, just nature turning on a dime, and the kind of creeping dread that builds when you're cut off, helpless, and in the dark with a baby in your arms. This story doesn’t need exaggeration. It’s as true as it gets.

We’d been going out there for years. East Leichhardt Dam is a hidden slice of peace in Queensland’s northwest—around 40 kilometers from Mount Isa, tucked away in the vast, dusty outback. No traffic. No city noise. Just red earth, open sky, the quiet slap of water against the shore, and the occasional screech of cockatoos overhead. Perfect for families who wanted to disappear for a few days. And we did. That weekend, twenty-nine of us showed up in utes and SUVs, towing trailers and tents. Friends, cousins, neighbors. We all knew the drill. We’d done this nearly every Easter.

Mark, our little one Emma, and I had our tent pitched right by the water—maybe a little too close in hindsight. It had been a typical Queensland March day: stinking hot, sun blazing down, dragonflies skating across the surface of the dam. Kids ran barefoot between tents, yelling, laughing, faces sticky with melted icy poles. Emma napped in the shade most of the afternoon while Mark fished with Tom and Sarah’s boys off a rocky outcrop nearby. I remember looking out and thinking how perfect it all was. The sun dipped low and turned the water coppery. We cooked snags over the firepit, and someone strung up fairy lights between two gum trees. For a few hours, it really felt like we were the only people on Earth.

After the kids were tucked away in their tents, we gathered around the fire with beers and marshmallows. I handed Sarah the bag while Jake jabbed at the flames with a stick, getting just a bit too close like kids always do. Everyone was relaxed, talking about fishing plans, teasing each other, laughing like there wasn’t a care in the world. At about 10, we zipped up our tent, checked on Emma—she was out cold in her little sleeping bag—and laid down listening to the fire crackle outside. The sky was clear, stars so thick it looked painted.

Then I woke to the sound. A strange, low roar that didn’t make sense at first. Not thunder. Not wind. Something else. Disorienting. I sat up fast, heart pounding, and felt something off—my sleeping bag was damp. Not sweat, not condensation. Wet. I threw the flap off and reached down. My hand touched freezing water pooling on the tent floor.

“Mark!” I whispered, trying not to scare Emma, but my voice shook. “The tent’s flooding!”

He jolted up, groggy at first. “What?” But when he moved, water sloshed.

That’s when we heard Emma’s cry, a thin wail cutting through the dark. I scooped her up, my hands shaking. She was dry, thank God, but I could feel the cold coming up through the tent floor. Water was at our shins and rising. We didn’t understand how—it hadn’t rained much that day. But something had changed. Maybe they opened a release valve upstream. Maybe a hidden storm upstream dumped a load on us. We didn’t have time to wonder.

Mark lunged for the zipper, tugged, swore. It was jammed. The fabric was swollen, the zipper stiff with grit. Panic clawed at my throat. The water was at my knees now. The baby was crying louder.

“Try harder!” I snapped, every nerve on fire.

Mark went under the waterline, trying to force the zip. For a second I thought he’d vanished. Then he burst up, gasping, and ripped it open with a grunt. We spilled out into hell.

The campsite was a different world from what we’d gone to sleep in. The fire was out. The whole lower area was submerged in churning, muddy water. Flashlights cut the dark in erratic streaks, people shouting names, kids crying. Lightning flashed and in those moments of light, you could see tents collapsing under the weight of water, coolers floating away like toys, gear torn loose.

Sarah came wading toward us, water up to her waist, dragging Jake behind her. His mouth was open in a cry but he made no sound—just wide eyes and shivering lips.

“The river’s flooding! Move to the hill!” she yelled, spitting rain.

We grabbed what we could—Emma, a baby bag, our phones in a zip pouch—and joined the mass of wet, panicked people slogging through water toward the hill that edged the camp. The dam had breached into the lowlands and was swallowing everything. I nearly slipped three times on the slick mud. The current tugged hard at my thighs. A chair went spinning past. A cooler slammed into my leg. All I could do was grip Emma tighter, whispering promises I wasn’t sure I could keep.

On the hill, someone had grabbed a blue tarp and we all crowded underneath, shivering and soaked. A few men were taking stock—counting heads, calming the kids. But you could feel the edges fraying. People were trying not to cry. I remember seeing Sarah wrap Jake in a wet towel, his lips blue, and Tom trying to call emergency on his phone.

“No signal,” he muttered. “None of us have signal.”

Of course we didn’t. This was the outback. Beautiful, remote, and entirely cut off once you left the bitumen. We were stranded. Water kept rising below us. I could hear it—loud and relentless, like it wanted to climb higher.

“Mark,” I whispered, “what if it reaches us up here?”

He didn’t answer right away. Just pulled Emma in tighter and looked out into the blackness, eyes narrowed like he was trying to will the water to stop.

Then came the splashes. Not gentle ones. Sharp, heavy. Something big moving in the water, snapping branches. At first we thought it was debris. But it came again. Closer. The kind of noise that didn’t sound right. That felt *alive*. I thought of crocodiles. I’d heard rumors they could be in this dam, even if they weren’t supposed to be. That fear crept in fast and hard. We were on a narrow hill with kids, no shelter, and a baby in my arms.

I heard one of the kids whisper, “Is it a monster?” And no one answered.

Jake started crying again, and then doubled over, clutching his stomach. He was pale, sweating, teeth chattering.

“He’s not okay,” Sarah said, panicked.

That’s when I remembered my phone. My iPhone 14. The one with the new Emergency SOS via satellite thing. I fumbled it out, terrified it had drowned, but it came to life. The screen lit up like a beacon. I opened the SOS app, hands clumsy and wet, following the steps—point it at the sky, wait for a connection. It felt like it took forever, but suddenly the status changed: *Connected*.

I nearly dropped it from relief.

“I’ve got it!” I yelled. “It’s working!”

The others went still, watching me, barely breathing as I talked to emergency services. I told them where we were, what had happened, the number of people, the sick child. I didn’t even realize I was crying until the operator gently said, “Help is on the way. Stay put, stay together.”

We passed the phone around so everyone could confirm their names, the count. That little bit of contact changed everything. Not the fear, not the cold, but we weren’t alone anymore.

Still, the wait was torture. The night dragged on, every noise out in the black making us jump. A splash here, a rustle there. Someone swore they saw eyes glowing in a flashlight beam. It could’ve been anything. Could’ve been nothing. But no one slept. We huddled tight, holding our children, teeth chattering, watching the water edge closer.

Finally, sometime after four, we saw the first lights. They shimmered in the distance, then bobbed—flashlights, then headlamps. And voices. Rescuers. They came in inflatable boats, moving carefully through the submerged mess that had been our camp.

“Emergency services!” one shouted. “Stay where you are!”

We did. Tears, cheers, shouts of thanks erupted. They helped us down the hill in groups, starting with the littlest kids and Jake, who could barely walk. I passed Emma over, my arms nearly numb, and a woman wrapped her in a thermal blanket.

“You’re safe now,” she said. “We’ve got you.”

By sunrise, we were all in Mount Isa. Cold. Exhausted. Shell-shocked. But alive. Jake was taken to hospital, treated for dehydration and an abdominal infection. He’s fine now. We all are. Physically, anyway.

But every time I hear rain on a tent roof now, something twists in my stomach.

We talk about that night sometimes. Usually not in detail. But I always tell people about the tech—the SOS satellite feature. If that hadn’t worked, I don’t know how long we would’ve waited. And I always remind them: out there, nature doesn’t care about your plans. You might go looking for peace and still find terror. No ghosts. No monsters. Just the real kind of fear.



The kind that leaves you checking the sky for rescue.







**""Buried in White: The Weekend That Nearly Killed Us"":**

I thought we were in for a fun weekend, a little escape from the grind, something to clear our heads and reset before winter really set in. Instead, we got something else entirely—a brutal, terrifying fight for survival that still haunts me. Snow trapped us, fear gripped us, and if it wasn’t for our SPOT satellite device, I don’t think we would’ve made it out alive. Every word of this is true.

It was the last weekend of October, one of those weird transition periods where autumn’s just about done but winter hasn’t fully settled in yet. Me, Lisa, Ryan, and Emma had been planning the camping trip for weeks. The idea was to get off the grid—no phones, no emails, no traffic—just four friends, a roaring fire, and the quiet majesty of the wild. We picked a remote valley in British Columbia, a place Lisa had found online that looked stunning—hidden river, thick pine forest, mountains rising in every direction like massive stone sentinels. It was supposed to be perfect.

I packed the essentials—tent, stove, food, layers of warm clothing. But I also packed something else, something I never go out into the wilderness without anymore: a small orange SPOT device that can send an SOS signal via satellite in case of an emergency. I clipped it to the side of my pack as we loaded up the car. Lisa noticed it immediately and raised an eyebrow, smirking.

“What’s that, your alien tracker?” she joked, tossing her sleeping bag into the trunk.

“It’s a satellite messenger,” I said, not looking up. “No cell service where we’re going. This could save us if anything goes wrong.”

Ryan gave me one of his trademark smirks. “Save us from what, bears?”

“Or bad weather,” I said, more seriously than I intended. “You never know out there.”

Emma was already in the backseat, scrolling through a playlist. “Whatever, Tom. Let’s just go. We’re burning daylight.”

The drive to the trailhead took a few hours, winding through stretches of dark forest and narrow mountain roads that made the car feel small and fragile. We parked just before a closed forestry gate and slung our packs on, the air cold enough to make our breath visible. The ground was layered in fallen pine needles, and every step crunched underfoot as we started the hike. The four-mile trail to the valley was beautiful, dotted with tiny waterfalls and glacial boulders half-covered in moss. We took our time, laughing, snapping photos, passing a thermos of coffee back and forth.

The clearing was even more beautiful than we’d hoped. A wide, flat space by the river, framed by towering trees, the sound of rushing water just loud enough to drown out everything else. We pitched our tents, gathered deadfall, and built a fire. As dusk settled over the valley, we cooked burgers on a camp stove, roasted marshmallows, and told stupid ghost stories. That night felt perfect—crisp, clean air; stars sharp as glass; and the flicker of flames dancing off our faces. It felt like a dream.

But sometime after midnight, I woke up to a noise. At first, I thought it was just wind—a long, low moaning sound sweeping through the trees. Then I heard something crunching outside, slow and deliberate. I held my breath, listening. It stopped. Maybe just a deer or branches shifting under snow weight. I zipped my bag tighter and eventually drifted back to sleep.

The next morning looked fine—gray clouds, yes, but nothing alarming. We made campfire coffee, cooked eggs, and spent most of the morning fishing along the river. It was peaceful, until the air started to feel… different. Heavy, still. You know that weird silence that comes before a storm? That’s what it felt like.

“Looks like snow,” Emma said, glancing at the sky, brows drawn.

Ryan pulled out his phone, even though it had no reception. “Weather app said flurries. Light stuff.”

I didn’t feel good about it. “Maybe we should head back early. I’ve got a bad feeling.”

Lisa rolled her eyes and sighed. “Tom, come on. We came out here to relax. Don’t be that guy.”

I let it go, even though everything in my gut told me to push harder. Around noon, the first flakes began to fall. Soft, harmless little things that melted as soon as they touched the ground. We kept fishing, figuring it would pass. But it didn’t. The flakes got bigger, and soon the wind picked up, howling down the valley like something alive. By 2 p.m., the ground was coated, and the snowfall was so dense we could barely see the trees across the river.

“We need to go,” I said firmly. “Now.”

Ryan shook his head. “We’re fine. We’ve got gear. We’ll ride it out.”

Emma looked around, her face pale. “It’s piling up fast. The tents… they’re already sagging.”

We started packing, but by then it was too late. The trail we came in on had vanished, buried under at least a foot of snow. Every direction looked the same—just white and trees and the ghost of the river’s path. Lisa checked her phone again, futilely. Nothing. No signal. My stomach turned. We were cut off.

“Stay calm,” I said, trying not to let my voice shake. “We’ll hunker down, conserve heat, wait it out.”

As darkness fell, the storm only got worse. The wind tore at the tents, snow driving sideways like bullets. We ended up cramming into one tent, knees pressed together, sharing body heat, wrapped in every layer we had. The food was down to a couple of protein bars and a bag of soggy bread. Our water bottles were freezing solid. I kept hearing things outside—twigs snapping, something moving just beyond the tent wall. Probably deer or coyotes. But in that storm, with no way out, even the smallest sound felt menacing.

“We’re gonna freeze out here,” Lisa whispered at one point, her lips barely moving.

“Don’t talk like that,” Ryan said sharply. “The storm’ll pass. It has to.”

But it didn’t. By morning, the snow was waist-deep in places. The fire pit had vanished. The tents were buried halfway. We couldn’t feel our toes. Emma’s face was ghost-white, her hands trembling. That’s when I pulled out the SPOT.

“We need help,” I said, holding it up. “We’re stuck.”

Ryan looked at it like it was a grenade. “What if it doesn’t work? Or if no one comes?”

“We have to try,” Emma said through chattering teeth. “Please, Tom.”

I pressed the SOS button. A red light blinked to life, slow and steady. I set it on a flat rock outside the tent, brushed snow away from it, and whispered a silent prayer. Then we waited.

That wait was the longest day of my life. We barely spoke. Just sat there, arms wrapped around each other, listening to the wind batter the tent. Lisa cried quietly. Ryan stared at the wall like he was somewhere else. I kept checking the SPOT every hour, making sure it wasn’t buried. I couldn’t stop thinking about the worst-case scenarios. What if the battery died? What if no one was monitoring? What if rescue couldn’t reach us in time?

Around 4 p.m., I heard it—a low thumping sound, like a heartbeat in the sky. I stumbled out, half-frozen, shielding my eyes. Then I saw the lights through the snow—rotating, piercing the blizzard. A helicopter. I yelled, screamed, waved my arms like a lunatic. The others poured out of the tent, doing the same. The chopper touched down near the river, rotors kicking up a white cyclone. Two rescue workers in neon orange jackets came running, shouting through the wind.

“Did you activate the satellite beacon?”

“Yes!” I yelled, holding up the device. “We’re over here!”

They moved fast, wrapping us in blankets, checking our vitals, asking questions. Emma could barely walk. Lisa was on the verge of collapsing. They said we were lucky—we were all showing signs of hypothermia, but we’d make it. As we lifted off, I looked down at what was left of our camp. Just a few barely visible mounds in the snow. The fire pit was gone, the tents crushed under powder. We were so close to not making it.

At the hospital, they gave us hot drinks and warm beds. A doctor told us the storm had dropped four feet of snow in less than 18 hours—one of the worst early-season blizzards in that region’s history. Another group a few miles away hadn’t been found yet. The SPOT device had saved us. Its signal cut through the storm and gave rescuers our exact coordinates.

Later that night, Ryan clapped me on the shoulder, his eyes red. “I was wrong about that thing. You saved our asses.”

I didn’t say much. I was still shaking, not just from the cold, but from everything we’d just been through. Lisa and Emma didn’t speak much either, just sat close, quiet and exhausted. We made a promise that night—no more late-season camping trips. No more ignoring the signs. And never again without a satellite device.



Nature’s beautiful. It can give you moments of peace that nothing else can. But it doesn’t care about your plans. It doesn’t care if you’re prepared or if you’re scared. It just is. And out there, a single mistake, a single decision to wait too long, can be the difference between life and death. If it wasn’t for that little orange box, I wouldn’t be here writing this. None of us would.







**“Whispers in the Ozarks”:**

Last summer, in July 2024, my friends Mike, Tom, Lisa, and I decided to go camping in the Ozark foothills. We’d been talking about getting out of the city for months—tired of concrete, honking horns, and the constant buzz of our phones. The Ozarks felt like the perfect escape. Wild, untouched in places, with thick forests, winding trails, and waterfalls that looked like they belonged in a movie. We loaded up two cars with gear, snacks, and enough firewood to last the weekend. Spirits were high. None of us had any idea that we were about to live through a night that would haunt us forever.

We pulled into a small, primitive campground tucked beside a cold, bubbling brook late Friday afternoon. The trees towered above us, their leaves shimmering in the sun. Pine, damp earth, and a whisper of wildflowers filled the air. It felt good to breathe it in, to be away from everything. We chose a spot near the water, flat and soft enough to pitch tents. Mike immediately began wrestling with his, grumbling as he tried to fit mismatched poles together. “These instructions might as well be in Greek,” he said, tossing the crumpled paper over his shoulder. Lisa, more patient, stepped in to help him while Tom and I focused on the fire pit, stacking rocks and kindling in a neat cone.

That night, with the fire crackling and the stars bright overhead, we sat in a loose circle, roasting marshmallows and planning our hike. Tom spread out the map between us, the edges fluttering in the breeze. “It’s only about two and a half miles to the waterfall,” he said, tracing a faint red line with his finger. “Piece of cake.” The trail looked simple—well-marked and looping back to the main path. We weren’t worried. We were young, strong, and more than a little overconfident.

The next morning, we packed day bags with granola bars, trail mix, water bottles, and a first-aid kit. I tucked my GPS tracker into the side pocket of my pack. It wasn’t fancy—just a small brick of plastic and buttons, with a screen the size of a playing card. I’d bought it after reading one too many articles about people vanishing in national parks. Mike rolled his eyes when he saw it. “You really think we’ll need that?” he teased. “It’s the Ozarks, not the Amazon.” I shrugged. “It’s insurance.” I didn’t expect to use it. None of us did.

The trail started easy, shaded by dense trees, sunlight dappling the ground like golden coins. We followed the wooden trail markers, each painted with a faded white triangle. Birds chirped, bugs buzzed, and every now and then we’d pause to admire wild mushrooms or strange rock formations. About an hour in, we came to a fork. One trail bent to the right and looked maintained. The other veered left—narrower, more overgrown. The map didn’t match what we were seeing.

“I think it’s this way,” Mike said, pointing left. “It probably loops around.” Lisa frowned, brushing back her hair. “That path barely looks like a trail.” I checked the map again, but the lines were vague, with too few landmarks to orient us. Tom looked down the left trail and nodded. “Feels right to me.” So we went. I still regret that moment.

The deeper we went, the more the trail vanished. Bushes scratched our legs, and low branches snagged our clothes. The ground was uneven, tangled with roots and hidden holes. It became clear we’d left the trail behind, but we kept walking, convinced we’d find it again just ahead. My unease grew with each step. The sun filtered less and less through the dense canopy, casting long shadows that played tricks on the eyes.

Around 3 p.m., we admitted we were lost. The path had fully disappeared, and the forest pressed in around us like a wall. Tom tried to keep the mood light, but even he was sweating more than from the heat. “We’ll just backtrack,” he said, voice tight. But everything looked the same—trees, rocks, moss. Our footprints had long been erased by the underbrush. Panic crept in like cold water.

Then we saw the cabin.

It emerged out of nowhere in a small clearing, swallowed by vines and ivy. The wood was dark and rotted, the windows shattered, the door half-hanging on rusted hinges. For a long moment, none of us spoke. It was as if time had forgotten the place, and maybe something else hadn’t. “This is straight out of a horror movie,” I said. Lisa crossed her arms. “Can we *not* go inside?” But curiosity is a powerful thing, especially when you’re scared and tired. We peeked through the door.

Inside, it was dark, the air stale and sour. A metal bed frame sat crooked in the corner, its mattress torn open. On one wall, yellowed photos curled in broken frames—men in hunting gear, rifles slung over their shoulders, their faces grainy and expressionless. A pile of animal bones lay in a heap near the back. Something about that place felt wrong in a way I couldn’t explain, like it held onto emotions. We didn’t stay long.

After that, the forest felt different. More silent. The birds had stopped singing. The wind had stilled. We moved faster now, trying to find any sign of a trail. The sun was setting fast, casting everything in shadow. That’s when we heard the growl.

It was low, guttural, and far too close. It stopped all of us in our tracks. “Could be a deer,” Tom whispered, though he didn’t sound convinced. “Or a bear,” Mike said grimly. Lisa clung to my arm, and my heart thudded against my ribs. We waited, barely breathing. But the growl didn’t come again. Instead, we heard something worse—footsteps. Slow, steady, crunching over twigs and leaves. Then, whispers. Faint, too soft to make out words, like voices being carried on the wind. But there was no wind.

We ducked behind a fallen tree and crouched low. The whispers moved around us, circling. The footsteps would stop, then start again, like whoever—or *whatever*—was out there was pacing, searching. My mind raced. Maybe hunters. Maybe locals trying to scare us. Maybe something else. Then a light appeared in the trees. Small, like a flashlight, bobbing slowly. It passed just beyond the clearing, then stopped. The light flickered. Then vanished.

We didn’t move for ten minutes.

I remembered the GPS tracker in my pack. My hands were shaking as I pulled it out. The battery light blinked red. I pressed the SOS button, and it beeped once. “Please work,” I whispered. “Please.” I told the others it might take hours—if it worked at all. None of us wanted to admit out loud what we were all thinking: that we might not make it through the night.

The darkness was total now. We huddled together in the clearing, surrounded by shadows that shifted and breathed. Every snap of a twig felt like a gunshot. I thought I heard breathing nearby, then nothing. The minutes stretched, then hours. The cold seeped in, making my fingers stiff. Mike eventually broke the silence. “What if nobody’s coming?” he whispered. “They will,” I said, though I wasn’t sure anymore.

Then, just before midnight, came the faint sound of rotors. At first, I thought I was imagining it. But then the thrum grew louder, and a spotlight cut through the trees. We stood up, shouting, waving our arms. Relief nearly knocked me to my knees.

The helicopter hovered, and two rescuers rappelled down. One was a tall man with a blunt face and a calm voice. “You okay?” he asked, shining a flashlight in our eyes. “Just cold and scared,” I said. They guided us to a flat area where the helicopter could land, and we climbed in one by one. As we lifted into the sky, I looked down at the forest—a sea of darkness.

Back at the ranger station, wrapped in wool blankets, we were given coffee and told the GPS beacon had come through just in time. Without it, we might not have been found until daylight—if then. I asked the rescuer about the light, the whispers, the footsteps. He just shrugged. “People hear all kinds of things out here,” he said. “This forest’s old. Lots of stories. Sometimes, it’s just your mind filling in blanks.”

Maybe. Maybe not.



I’ll never know exactly what was out there that night. But I know we weren’t alone. I know we were being watched. And I know that without that tiny piece of technology, this story would have had a very different ending.",1,1746014814.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

""I did nothing to her!"" The sound of Erika's voice reverberated in the entire pack house as she followed Alex up the stairs, tears staining her delicate face.

She knew that Alex at least didn't like her, but they had been married for three years. Three whole years!

He still didn't trust her.

How could he say she was capable of murder when she hadn't even done anything to anyone for the past three years she had been living in the packhouse as his Luna?

She had done everything she knew a good Luna and good daughter in-law should do, making sure that everything and everyone was happy. But he still felt she hadn't done enough and couldn't even trust her.

If she really had ulterior motives, She would have directly killed everyone in the Blood Moon Pack with just a few Wolfbanes here and there in their food as she was the cook in the house.

But instead, Alex chose to believe that bitch that just arrived two days ago.

""You were the only one standing close to the staircase!"" Alex's voice boomed in anger.

How could a woman be so shameless?

She was the only one standing at the staircase at the time of the fall, how could she still deny the fact that she was responsible for Serenity's fall!

Erika gave Alex a bewildered look, ""Alex I did nothing! Serenity threw herself down the stairs to frame me!"" She defended anxiously.

That Serenity girl was vicious, extremely vicious. Even to her own self.

She and Serenity had been standing by the staircase earlier, discussing the issue of Serenity being Alex's first love and Erika being the obstacle.

Then suddenly, Serenity sighted Alex approaching and immediately grabbed Erika, saying Erika should forgive her.

At first, Erika was very surprised. But when she saw Alex approaching, She immediately understood the bitch's motive.

But she was already too late, because at that time, Serenity had already thrown herself down the stairs.

""Can you even hear yourself?!"" Alex barked and turned to look at her. He took two steps closer to her and pinned her on the railings.

The position he had her was so dangerous that if she missed a step, she would directly fall to her death.

Erika gulped as she stared into Alex's black eyes. One that looked like a bottomless dark well. The very ones she fell in love with the very first day she met him three years ago.

Those eyes that always held a deep resentment towards her.

It was looking very murderous right now. The same pair of black eyes looked like it was going to stab her a million times if she didn't keep her mouth shut.

""Erika…"" Alex breathed, using her name for the first time in three years, aside the day of their mating ceremony.

""I never knew you could be such a bloody disgusting liar! I saw you that day, your both hands.."" he grabbed her hands, ""this hands! They were the very ones I saw that were extended towards Serenity as if to push her! Now you tell me that you did nothing and she threw herself down the stairs on her own?!""

Alex felt the urge to laugh out loud at this woman's shamelessness.

She was not only a gold digger and a shameless woman, but also a bloody liar.

Erika's tears fell uncontrollably from her eyes as she felt Alex's hand tightened his grip on her wrist.

It hurt so much but she couldn't even voice out the pains.

Right from the first day she stepped into this pack house, she had never experienced happiness or what it felt like to be married.

She had expected a one sided love marriage to be a simple task to handle.

She felt it was easy to mend.

She had spoken to her father the day after the mating and he said that a man who didn't love her, would never love her.

But she waved it off and told him she could handle it all. Not knowing she was deceiving herself.

Her father, Alpha Jerome, had given her three years. Three years to mend her marriage and make her husband fall for her, or she had to return to their pack and take over as the next leader of the pack.

No one in the Blood moon pack knew about her identity as Alpha Jerome's only daughter.

She had hidden her identity from everyone, so she could live like a normal werewolf without having so many bootlickers.

But now, The three years given to her by Alpha Jerome have elapsed.

""If you want me to forgive you and give you a second chance, then you have to go and apologize to Seren. Tell her to forgive you, or else I wouldn't"" Alex said and released his hold on her. He turned around and began walking to their bedroom door.

He paused again suddenly, and without turning, he said to her, ""Be prepared for a divorce if she doesn't forgive you""

Erika gritted her teeth in anger as she watched him disappear into the room.

She, the daughter of Alpha Jerome of the Ironclaw Pack. Apologize to that lowlife husband thief?

Never!

She clenched her fist as she glared at the door Alex had disappeared into.

""I would rather leave than apologize to that low life"" she declared firmly and her wolf, Cindy purred in response to her words.

Erika wiped her tears, she wasn't going to cry for an already failed marriage.

If only she had listened to her father the first time he said she could always reject Alex, this wouldn't have happened.

She wouldn't have been in such a traumatizing situation.

No one liked her in the pack house except the pack elders.

Alex's mom and sister were never good to her from the very beginning.

They made her stay in the packhouse, a living hell.

Making sure she did the work of the maids instead.

She cooked, cleaned, and washed. Something a Luna should never be seen doing.

She did all that without any complaints. But after everything, they all sided Serenity and left her to face the blame of what she never even did.

Erika was fed up this time. She was so done with living in a loveless marriage.

Her husband saw her as a gold digger, while the others saw her as a poor and ignorant gold digging orphan.

She let them all call her whatever they liked this past three years.

But today marked an end to all of that.

She was done with all of these mockeries.

It was time to listen to her father.

She would leave the Bloodmoon and go back to the Ironclaw to fulfill her destiny.

# Chapter2 Forced To Apologize

The door to their bedroom was pushed open and Erika walked in.

She saw Alex sitting my the window with some papers which she assumed were the pack projects. It didn't matter to her though.

Alex looked up from the papers in his hand and tilted his head with a grin on his face.

""She forgave you?"" He asked, but Erika clenched her fist and responded, ""Alex, I want a divorce""

Alex's hand froze mid air as he tried to take a sip of whatever he was drinking.

Did he hear her right?

The smile on his face had disappeared without a trace.

He smirked and finally took a sip of the coffee.

""You want a divorce?"" He asked as if she hadn't said it the first time.

She nodded and met his gaze, ""Yes"" she answered, her voice firm and resolute.

He chuckled lightly and stood up to his full height.

""So you rather chose a divorce than apologize to Seren?""

The pet names he always called Serenity was the most painful for her.

She could clearly count in her head how many times he had even addressed her - Erika, by her name.

That is, two times only.

""When did you change this much?"" Alex asked as he made his way to where she stood. ""You used to be very obedient. But now you can't even give a common apology. You suddenly have an ego""

Erika looked into his mocking eyes and retorted, ""Alex, I'm innocent! I did nothing wrong to Sere\_""

Alex used a finger to silence her.

""Keep your mouth shut. Do you have evidence to prove your innocence?""

He removed his finger from her lips to let her answer. Her answer was an unexpected one.

""My words are enough""

Alex rolled his eyes at the dumb woman.

How could she be so stupid?

""Erika, if you think that you could just do whatever you want and go scot-free, then you have to wake up""

He said and Erika looked at him in confusion.

She didn't expect the next thing that followed.

Alex dragged her by the arm roughly, out of their room and straight downstairs.

Their were maids in the living room, doing some cleaning.

Some Elders and Guards were also present in the living room when Alex dragged Erika pass them and straight outside of the pack.

Just as they appeared outside, they both ran into Gage, Alexander's Beta as he was bringing in the one and only bitch who was responsible for this whole thing.

Serenity looked very pitiful, with bandages on her head as she limped her way into the pack house.

Seeing the way Alex dragged his mate, Gage walked forward to stop him immediately.

""What's going on, man? Where are you taking your mate?""

He asked as he saw the bruise Alex had given Erika on her pale skin.

It was very evident as Erika was extremely fair.

Alex on seeing Serenity, left Erika and rushed over to her immediately.

He pulled her softly into his arms in front of everyone and this gesture made Erika's wolf, Cindy, growl in anger.

""How could he care for someone else more than his mate?!"" Cindy barked in anger.

""Are you alright?"" Alex asked the pitiful looking Serenity, ""Come and take a sit over here"" he pulled her towards the sofa in the living room and made her sit on it.

The entire pack members who were present, watched as their Alpha treated another woman better than his mate.

They couldn't blame the Alpha for his showing his affection towards Serenity.

The Luna's Actions had greatly displeased the entire pack members and they all looked at her in disdain.

""Why is the Alpha treating that woman like his mate?"" Someone whisper asked, to the hearing of Erika who was close to them.

""The Luna pushed that woman down the stairs, I guess it was because she was jealous""

""Yes, the Alpha treats that woman better than his mate""

""But I've known Luna Erika to be a nice lady. Who would have thought she was this heartless and evil?""

Erika heard all their words clearly as tears fell from her eyes.

How could the pack members be this despicable?

They clearly said she wasn't someone to do such, but they believed she did it.

It hurt her that no one believed her in the pack, especially her own mate.

Alex was supposed to be the first person to ask what exactly happened and not make the decision like a coward.

""He is a coward!"" Cindy agreed.

Alex looked at Serenity's pale face and touched the bandage on her head a bit.

The bitch who should have gotten a good award for her acting, winced in response and squeezed out a tear.

""It hurts, Alex"" she whined and Alex rubbed her back soothingly.

He then turned and glared at Erika who stood there with her hands holding her clothes tightly.

Alex moved, he appeared before her, towering over her as he demanded, ""Erika, go over there and apologize to Serenity""

Erika gritted her teeth.

""I said I would never apologize for something I didn't do""

""Stop acting stubborn and go there now!"" Alex raised his voice this time, almost raising his hand as well.

Erika was such an annoying woman.

Erika raised her eyes to meet his. She dared not cower before him like a puppy.

""Alex, I did nothing wrong and I will never apologize""

Alex laughed and shook his head.

""And why is that? Why won't you apologize?""

""Because I didn't do anything to her!""

""Erika that's enough!"" Alex gripped her chin and she winced at the pain his grip brought.

Gage tried to intervene, but one warning look from Alex made him froze in his steps.

""Erika, you will go over there and apologize to Serenity Or else, don't blame me for my next actions""

Cindy whimpered as their mate mistreated she and Erika.

Erika had already declared that she would never apologize for what she didn't do, so she stood her ground.

""I said, I won't apologize. Besides you gave me an option to choose from and I chose divorce over apologizing!""

Alex shook his head and brought her face closer to his.

""I'm sorry to tell you, but the conditions have changed now. You are going to apologize and divorce at the same time""

# Chapter3 Apologize and Divorce

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*ERIKA'S POV\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Never in a million years did I ever think that I would hear such words from Alex.

My eyes were fixed solely on his face, neglecting the intense pain coming from my chin.

His death grip was extremely painful, but the pain didn't match up to the one I felt in my heart.

I had loved Alex for three years. I did everything for him, sacrificed everything just to be by his side and be a good Luna for his pack.

But it seems like not everyone deserved sacrifices.

How could he trust a woman whom he hadn't seen for the past seven years over me who had been with him for three years?

Serenity just came back two days ago and he already trusted her?

Was it because of her looks?

Sure, Serenity was beautiful and dainty, But I wasn't bad looking either.

""You're much prettier than that bitch"" Cindy added and I almost nodded in approval.

But Alex kept choosing her. Choosing her over his own mate.

""Alex..."" I tried to call out to him in the most sweetest voice I believed I had.

But he pushed my face away and groaned in anger.

He turned again to look at me and said, ""Erika, be good and apologize to Seren""

But I still wouldn't budge and just shook my head.

Why should I apologize to that dog?

""I won't apologize"" I said again, my head lowered.

Murmurs filled the surrounding as everyone began talking about me.

I couldn't care less about them. They didn't want to believe me, so why should I be bothered about how they saw me?

""Alex, believe me this once, I didn't push her....."" I was still saying when suddenly as fast as the wind, Alex turned and grabbed my neck harshly.

My eyes widened as I felt him choke me.

""Erika you will kneel and apologize to Seren right here, right now!"" He said in his Alpha voice and I froze.

Did Alex hate me that much?

Just what does that Serenity mean to him?

I felt my breath leaving me slowly and I began to struggle for air, holding tightly to his arms as my tears poured down heavily.

""Al\_Al\_Alex..."" I clutched to his arm tightly, hoping he would let me go and let me take a breather.

Gage seemed to have noticed that I was really choking, he rushed over and held Alex, trying to get his hands off my neck.

""Alex stop, you're choking her!"" He yelled and pulled Alex back immediately.

From the corner of my eyes, I saw Serenity smirk with a wink.

""That bitch!"" Cindy growled in anger as I fell to the floor, clutching to my neck.

Alex looked down at me and ran a hand through his hair.

""Erika, apologize quickly!"" Gage was the one who spoke, but I ignored him, still lying breathless on the floor.

""You think your stubbornness would get you anywhere?!"" Alex snarled.

I still ignored him, trying to catch my breath.

Alex wasn't pleased with my actions and he walked up to me again. He pulled me up harshly and I winced, but he didn't seem to care.

He pulled me to stand before Serenity who had tears in her eyes.

That sly witch.

""Kneel"" Alex commanded and I snapped my head to him.

First it was apologize, now kneel?

Over my dead body would I ever kneel before this dog.

""I will apologize, but I would never kneel before her"" I said through gritted teeth and Alex chuckled.

""You will do both, and you have no choice"" he said and the next second, he directly kicked the back of my kneel, making me kneel before Serenity.

I broke out in tears at this treatment.

How could my mate do this?!

""Now apologize!"" He yelled.

I gritted my teeth as pain coarsed through my entire body.

""Serenity, I'm sorry"" I said in more like a whisper.

""Louder!"" Alex nudged me and I almost fell.

""Serenity I'm sorry for pushing you down the stairs!"" I yelled out as more tears fell from my eyes.

This treatments and humiliations I faced today would forever be etched in my heart.

I would never forgive any of them and I'll make sure to get my revenge on them.

""That's more like it"" Alex said softly and turned to Serenity.

She looked at me pitifully and stood up, ""Please get up, Erika. You're the Luna of this pack, I'm not worthy for you to kneel before me"" she immediately helped me up.

""That cunning dog!"" Cindy yelled in anger, ""when you were asked to kneel, why didn't she say this?!""

I was pissed too. When I was asked to kneel, why didn't she say all these?

""It's all my fault for pissing you off that day, I never meant to say those hurtful words. I deserve that push"" Serenity said and looked down pitifully.

The bitch was still putting the blame on me!

I didn't even push her!

Alex came forward and took Serenity into his arms.

""It's not your fault, Seren""

He said and glared at me.

""Now that I apologized, can I get the divorce?"" I asked, my gaze fixed on the floor.

Alex chuckled and said, ""Yes, of course""

I felt my heart being stabbed by multiple knives.

I had asked that question to see if he would at least let me stay after apologizing.

But it seems he truly made up his mind to let me go this time.

""Ok then"" I said and looked up at him, staring directly into his black eyes.

Those eyes.

One that captured my heart on the first day we met.

One that I'd always get lost in each time I look into it.

Right now, those eyes were glaring daggers at me and I couldn't care less anymore.

""I, Erika Blackwood, stand before you, Alexander Robertson, with a heavy heart. I hereby reject you as my mate. The bond we once shared has grown fragile, and my soul yearns for a different path. May you find solace in the love of another, and may we both find the happiness we seek.""

# Chapter4 Dissolve Mate Bond

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*ERIKA'S POV\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

""You do know that rejecting Alex doesn't mean you've stopped being his Luna"" Cindy suddenly said and I paused from what I was doing.

I was currently in our bedroom, packing my stuffs and ready to vacate this hell of a packhouse.

""What do you mean?"" I asked, confused.

""I mean to say that, you can't just reject Alex and think that you're free"" Cindy said again.

""I heard you the first time, but why? What else has to be done?"" I asked.

""You both have to dissolve the mate bond""

Cindy answered.

""What?"" I asked in surprise, ""what do you mean dissolve the mate bond?""

""You both are Alphas, though he doesn't know. But mere rejection by words mean nothing, you have to dissolve the mate bond to be completely free from each other. I'm pretty sure Alex knows this as well""

I was taken aback by her explanation. I leaned by bedside table and my brows furrowed even more.

""How come I never knew about all this?"" I asked.

""Because you never listened to your father's teaching about mating"" Cindy snarled in response.

""Don't push the blame on me Cindy, my father was never an easy going man"" I said and continued my packing.

""I get it but still, you have to dissolve the mate bond""

""How do I do it?"" I asked half way through my packing.

""I'm not sure, maybe ask someone else, I really don't know how it works"" Cindy replied honestly.

I stopped moving again, ""who am I supposed to ask if not you?""

""Go ahead and ask Alex"" Cindy growled.

""Shut up"" i warned and continued.

As I finished packing my bags, I felt a surge of excitement. I was ready to leave this hell of a packhouse, and without anyone noticing, I quietly slipped out of the packhouse.

Inside, everyone seemed preoccupied, likely busy making sure Serenity's room was just the way Alex wanted it.

It really amused me how they treated her with such care and attention, as if she were the Luna herself. Meanwhile, the true Luna was being mistreated and treated like an Omega.

""Just ignore them and let's go,"" Cindy whispered.

I nodded in agreement, understanding that it was time to leave all the negativity behind. With a smile, I stepped out of the packhouse and onto the streets.

Twilight had already begun. The sky was painted with hues of orange and purple, and a serene calmness settled over the surroundings.

I walked through the dimly lit lonely street, Cindy's voice broke the silence suddenly, ""Erika, where are we headed now?"" she asked.

For a moment, I remained silent, lost in my own thoughts, continuing to put one foot in front of the other.

The decision I had made weighed heavily on my mind. I had finally reached a breaking point in the brutal life I had been living, and I knew it was time for a change.

This was when I needed to reach out to my family.

I was ashamed though, because my father had told me this would happen and I doubted him and trusted my own abilities.

I stopped walking and replied to Cindy, ""It's been three long years, now I'll to reach out to Jace.""

""I know this is a big step for you. But remember, you were never alone from the beginning. I'm here too, We're in this together,"" she said.

With renewed determination, I opened my mindlink once again, a connection I hadn't used in years. It felt strange yet familiar as I reached out to Jace, my stepbrother.

""Jace,"" I called out through the mindlink.

There was a brief moment of silence, and then I could sense his surprise through the mindlink.

It was as if he hadn't expected to hear from me after all these years. ""Erika?"" he replied, his voice laced with disbelief. ""Is that really you?""

A smile tugged at the corners of my lips as I felt a rush of emotions flood over me. ""Yes, Jace, it's me,"" I confirmed.

There was a pause on the other end of the mindlink, and I could sense his curiosity growing. ""What do you need, Erika? It's been three years, did your marriage work?"" Jace asked.

Taking a deep breath, I gathered my thoughts before continuing. ""Jace, I've made a decision. I'm leaving the Blood moon, and I'm returning to start a fresh,"" I explained. ""I want to meet you at the borders of the Bloodmoon Pack, now""

""Alright, I'll be there"" he responded and cut the mindlink.

I walked for a few more miles and finally, after what felt like an eternity, I arrived at the border.

My heart raced as I took in the sight before me. Parked there, right at the edge of the pack's territory, was a sleek and modern Tesla Model S Plaid, polished exterior gleamed under the moonlight, a stark contrast against the dark wilderness.

I smirked and slowly approached the car.

The door was slightly ajar, as if inviting me to step inside.

And then, as if in a dream, my heart surged with pride as my step brother Jace stepped out from the passenger side.

He looked different from the last time I had seen him three years ago. His shoulders were broader, his gaze more focused, and his height was impressive.

He had a dark aura around him, one that wasn't that obvious before.

We locked eyes in the dark, and instantly felt an unbreakable bond between us.

His driver stepped out as well, impeccably dressed, and exuding an air of professionalism and discretion.

""Wow, Jace looks completely different!"" Cindy screamed in my head and I almost rolled my eyes.

Part of me was thrilled to see him after three long years.

But there was also a sense of competition between us each time. Even if I was the Alpha, he never showed me that respect and instead acted like the typical big brother I'd really wish I didn't have.

We exchanged pleasantries, each trying to assert our dominance.

""Erika,"" Jace greeted me. ""Looking good. Ready to take on the pack?""

I smirked, determined not to let him have the upper hand. ""Of course, Jace. I've been preparing for this moment my whole life.""

""Yes! You're indeed ready!"" Cindy yelled happily.

Jace chuckled, his eyes sparkling with a mix of amusement and pride. ""Oh, I've always been one step ahead of you, little sis. But I'm excited to see what you bring to the table.""

I smiled softly as the driver came and took my luggage from me.

""Whatever I bring to the table, has nothing to do with you, Jace"" I replied, trying to sound sarcastic but also maintaining a respectful tone.

Jace finally chuckled and took a step away from where he stood.

""Welcome back, Erika""

# Chapter5 Luna Erika has left the pack

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Alex's POV\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

In my office, Gage sat across from me, looking surprised and concerned. He then blurted out, ""Dude, I can't believe Erika actually rejected you in front of everyone. That was intense!""

I lean back in my chair, trying to maintain a cool and collected facade. ""Relax. Erika was just throwing a tantrum. You know how she can be sometimes.""

Gage raised an eyebrow, clearly not convinced by my nonchalant response. ""But, Alex, it seemed like more than just a tantrum. She seemed really serious about ending things with you. Are you sure you're not underestimating her feelings?""

I shrug, trying to downplay the situation. ""Look, Gage, I know Erika better than anyone. She's always been a bit dramatic, especially when things don't go her way. And she might be a bit mad because I nearly choked her and made her apologize to Seren, but trust me, this is just another one of her phases. She'll come around eventually.""

Gage leaned forward, his voice filled with genuine concern. ""I don't know, man. This feels different.""

Just as Gage finished his statement, a knock came at the door immediately and we both shifted our attentions to the door.

That must be Erika.

I knew she would be ok in no time, like I told Gage.

""Come in"" Gage Called and the door was pushed open.

In walked a maid with her head bowed as she stood before us.

""Greetings, Alpha Alex and Beta Gage.""

She greeted and I just leaned back into her seat.

""Why are you here?"" I asked.

She hesitated and began fidgeting with her clothes.

""Are you here to take your clothes off?"" Gage suddenly asked as he took a sip of his wine.

I almost chuckled but I had to look serious before them.

""No, no sir. I'm here for something else""

""Which is?"" I asked this time.

""Alpha Alex, Luna Erika has left the pack"" The maid said and I froze.

It took me roughly 2 minutes to process her words.

Erika left the pack?

Gage turned to give me that knowing look of his and I glared at him.

He turned to look at the maid and stretched out his hand to give the cup back to her.

""Thanks for the information, please take this back to the kitchen and don't come back till we call for you"" He said and the maid nodded, before scurrying away.

Gage then turned back to me again and smiled.

""Alex, Erika left the pack""

He purposely repeated and I had the urge to hurl something at him.

""So?"" I asked instead, seeming unfazed.

""I'm telling you your mate left the pack and all you could say is so?"" Gage asked in disbelief.

What was he expecting me to do?

Go after her?

Oh please, I'm the Alpha and not some dog who follow a woman around.

""Erika is such a child, she is just throwing a tantrum. She'll return when no one says a word to her"" I said tiredly and took up a project I left pending for weeks.

""Alex can you hear yourself?!"" Gage yelled and my wolf growled as well.

""Keep it down, will you?""

""How can I do that when you don't even act like you're sane?!""

I rolled my eyes at him, ""I am sane, Gage. You just don't understand Erika"" I tell him and focused on the paper in hand again.

""So what if she doesn't return as you said?"" Gage asked and I was so tempted to send him out of my office.

How could he be such a pest in another man's issues.

My lips curled into a smirk as I sneered,"" A poor orphan, fatefully bound to me. Does she truly believe that abandoning the sanctuary of the Bloodmoon Pack will offer her solace? She deluded herself if she thinks the streets will be kind to her, far from the luxury she's grown accustomed to within this walls""

Gage just gave me a bewildered look and I smiled.

I stood up to my feet and strolled towards him, patting his shoulders softly.

""Erika is a gold digger who found her way into being a Luna of this pack through the moon goddess. I'm even surprised how she matched me up with a lowlife instead of someone like Seren. Speaking of Seren, I have to go check on her, she must be awake""

I matched towards the door when Gage suddenly called out to stop me again.

""Alex, you're seriously not going to look for Erika?""

I groaned in anger and turned to look at him in annoyance.

""She will return on her own"" i said and pulled the door open to leave.

""You really have to go look for Erika"" I heard my wolf, Elijah spoke in my mind and I rolled my eyes.

""You too? Weren't you there when she rejected us?"" I asked him.

""That was because you treated her wrongly!"" Elijah growled.

""What wrong did I do?"" I asked.

""You asked her to kneel before that cunning woman and apologize. You even almost killed her!""

I chuckled at his words.

""Firstly, Erika had to apologize and secondly, she was very annoying and disobedient, so I was carried away by my anger and choked her"" I replied as I got closer to Seren's door.

""Now be good, Elijah. Erika will return when she's done wandering the entire city without any help."" Elijah let out a frustrated groan, clearly angered by my decision of not looking for her.

But I didn't let his annoyance get to me. I knew that deep down, he would come to terms with it soon. After all, Erika's actions were her own choice, and we couldn't force her to stay if she didn't want to.

As I reflected on Erika's behavior, a mix of frustration and disappointment washed over me.

She could be so cunning and manipulative, always playing her own game. It wasn't enough for her to simply be jealous of Seren; she had even tried to kill her. Now, she had taken it a step further by leaving, likely to make herself look pitiful in front of my subjects.

Erika was being pretentious and she was always seeking attention and sympathy, using any means necessary to achieve her desired image. But deep down, I knew that her actions would only lead to more complications and challenges for herself.

# Chapter6 Returning to the Ironclaw Pack

\*\*\*\*\*Erika's POV\*\*\*\*\*

""Father had never stopped talking about your marriage with that Alpha for the past three years"" Jace said to me as he continued going through the papers in his hand.

We were in the car, currently going back to my pack. Jace had insisted that I return home first, and on the day of dissolving the mate bond, he would gladly bring me back to the Moon forest pack, so that I could leave Alex for good.

It did hurt that I left my husband, but I also know that every decisions I was taking right now, is for the best.

Alex had hurt me, including the entire pack members, so feeling sad for leaving my problems behind was very unacceptable.

""Why would he even be talking about my marriage?"" I begrudgingly asked. My father and my brother could be very nosy at times. I hated it when they stalked me, or try to look into my personal life. But I still couldn't deny the fact that they cared for me, deeply.

After the argument with my dad three years ago, he shouldn't even be thinking about me. But he still cared and kept an eye on me daily.

I was pretty sure he knew every single maltreatments I faced in the moonforest. Whether he planted a spy in the moonforest or not, he would get any information he wanted about me. So I just couldn't hide, even if I wanted to.

""You clearly told him three years ago, if I remember, that you would mend your marriage. But we have a result already, don't we?"" Jace said and chuckled at the last part.

He sure knew how to make mockery of me. I had always kept to my word when it came to making decisions and promises, but my failed marriage was a whole new level of difficult.

A loveless marriage would never benefit anyone, Instead it would break you till you become the shell of your own self.

""Here, this is the new cotract papers"" Jace handed me the papers he had been going through earlier.

""What's this for?"" I asked, giving him a raised brow.

'The new contract"" Jace repeated.

""I heard you the first time, what is this contract all about?""

Jace sighed with a smile tugging at his lips, ""Three years ago when you were about to get tied down by that manwhore, you signed a contract with father, right?"" He asked.

""Yes, I did"" I replied.

""Well this is the new one, more like the opposite of the previous contract"" he said again and this time, I snatched the papers from him.

Cindy was already getting pissed by the contract word that Jace couldn't stop saying.

I skimmed through the entire thing exhaustedly and realized it was actually a contract that stated that I wouldn't have anything to do with the moonforest ever again, and I would be the Alpha of the Ironclaw Pack till the day I take my last breath.

Seriously?

The day I take my last breath?

""Why did dad change the rules?"" I asked Jace in shock.

He smiled in return and said, ""you're the first woman to lead the Ironclaw, so he needed to change the rules""

I furrowed my brow at his explanation.

What has me being the first female to rule the pack, have to do with being the Alpha till my last breath?

Jace seemed to have read my mind, because he added, ""you are not allowed to get married again, Erika. But you can keep a lover, you just can't mark each other.""

My eyes widened at his words. I felt the world spin as well.

""Your father is sure very strict"" Cindy chimed in and I growled.

""Don't worry Sis, you'll be just fine"" Jace encouraged and I had no other choice but to relax.

I took the pen from him and elegantly signed my name, accepting the rules my father had brought in suddenly.

Jace smiled at me and patted my head softly.

""You're not just an ordinary woman, Erika. You are the most powerful woman in this country and more""

He said, eyes flashing with something unknown.

I smiled at his words and looked down at the papers once again.

My thoughts went back to my mother in-law and sister in-law who said they despised me because I was a poor orphan.

How would they react if they discovered that I was actually the youngest member of the blackwood family and the next Alpha of the Ironclaw Pack?

I remembered when Alex's sister fell ill from drinking a little amount of wolfsbane mistakenly, I had to stay up late at night to make her every meal she requested for.

She would whine and cry, saying she felt pains in her stomach and her wolf was in pain as well. At the end she would ask me to make her some pasta and meatballs. I knew these were all pretenses.

When everyone else slept, I would stay awake to make meals for her.

I clenched my fist, a trace of mockery flickering in my eyes.

Given the opportunity, I would definitely love to teach those two arrogant women a lesson and let out all my pent up anger!

Soon the car drove into the estate of the Ironclaw Packhouse and I relaxed a bit.

I was finally back home after three long years.

The entire place looked the same, security guards flooding the entire estate.

The car pulled up at the entrance of the mansion that was twice the size of the Moonforest packhouse.

A clear testament to the powerful influence of my pack.

The Moonforest was nothing compared to my pack and my pack as the number one in the country definitely lived upto it's reputation.

Jace pulled open the door and I stepped out from the car.

There were maids at the entrance and once I stepped down from the car, they all bowed in unison.

""Welcome back, Alpha Erika!""

They chorused and I smiled in response.

It felt good to be back home.

Jace led me into the mansion and straight to my father's study room.

If there was anyone I missed the most, it was my father.

We might have had a rift three years ago before I got into marriage, I still had the same amount of love and respect for him.

Even more if I may add.

""The entire place still looks the same"" Cindy said and I hummed a reply.

Indeed, nothing changed.

Soon, we arrived at the entryway of his office and Jace turned to me with a smile.

""Good luck with him, Sis"" he said and walked away once I nodded.

I took in deep breaths and knocked on the door.

His voice rang from the inside, urging me to come in.

With determination shining in my eyes, I muttered, ""Time to see father"" before pushing the door open and walking in.

# Chapter7 Dissolving the mate bond in two days

\*\*\*\*\*Erika's POV\*\*\*\*\*

The room was dimly lit, with the soft glow of the moonlight shining through the opened window.

And there he was, my father, sitting with an air of elegance and stoicism that had always defined him.

It had been three long years since I last saw him, and despite our differences, I couldn't deny the pang of missing him deep within my chest.

My gaze lingered on his back as he sat facing the window, his broad shoulders framed by the fading light.

I stood there, taking in the sight of him, admiring the way he carried himself with such grace and authority.

My father was the epitome of a good leader. One with strength and as the name of our pack implied, he ruled with an Ironclaw.

It was as if time had stood still, and at that moment, I saw him not just as a strict and domineering figure he always appeared to be, but as a father who had shaped me in more ways than I could ever fully comprehend.

Suddenly, he broke the silence, his voice carrying a weight of authority that sent shivers down my spine.

Without turning to look at me, he uttered a single, heavy word, ""Erika."" It was a simple yet powerful acknowledgment of my presence, a signal that our conversation was about to begin.

I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself as I stepped closer to him.

He finally turned his head slightly, his eyes meeting mine in the reflection of the window. There was a flicker of warmth and understanding in his gaze, a silent recognition of the struggles I had faced during my failed marriage.

I was right when I said my father spied on my marriage.

He probably knew I would fail to mend it.

Without a hint of judgment or reproach, he spoke again, his voice softer this time, ""Welcome home, Erika.""

Those three simple words held a world of meaning. It was an acknowledgement of my journey, a recognition that sometimes we stumble and fall, but family is always there to catch us.

I smiled at him softly and took a sit before him.

He then turned fully to look at me.",1,1746014597.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Tldr: multiple alarms, smart thermostat, smart lights, partner with big light, meds by bed with protein shake. Wish me luck


Cue my new attempt at making it better.

Prep work step 1:I now have a pill organizer. In it is my am and pm dose of stims, a B12 vitamin (just started) and my birth control. I found a cheap but not gross looking one for five bucks at hell (Walmart unfortunately and a whole other can of worms). Anticipated roadblocks are what happens when I forget to refill it. (Current workaround keep an stims close to bed anyway)

Prep work step 2: programable thermostat. If I'm cold I'm going to sleep. My spouse can not sleep if it isn't cold. Fine the thermostat is one (and this part is important) that auto switches between heat and ac. At bedtime it slowly starts getting colder. This prompts me to want to get under blankets. In am it brings the temp up to a temp where I want to throw the blankets off me rather than stay in them (for me this is 72-73). 

Step 4: smart lights. For context our bathroom is attached to our bedroom. The light shines almost perfectly on just my side of the bed. Red light doesn't dilate the pupils. Well past bedtime the bathroom lights go red. It is a visual indicator that if I am still up I'm up too long wrap my shit up.i can still see to get up and go to the bathroom at night without needing to turn on a light and without tripping and cussing. at 6 am they go out. (I often wake up a little too early. If I wake up an the lights are red still I can go back to sleep. If they are off I need to consider not doing that) from 6:15 to 6:45 they gradually come to full brightness and white light. 

Step 5: my partner warns me about big light but turns it on so he can do his stuff between 6:30 and 6:45. I'm am grouchy but this is necessary for both of us. 

Step 6: I have a protein shake that (though better cold) does not technically have to be refrigerated and my meds by my bed ready to go. I'm in luck that this protein shake is coffee flavored and contains caffeine.
 
Yes I still have the fifty thousand and incrementally closer together alarms. 

Today is day 1. It's taken ages to get the pieces in place but here's to hoping it is maintainable and works.

For today it is about an hour earlier than I am usually up. Now let's see if I can get my ass out the door.

1kbepn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DistantEchoes-js/comments/1kbepn7/if_i_could_encourage_you/,If I Could Encourage You,"S, I know you are carrying a really heavy load right now. It's completely understandable that you are feeling stressed. You pour so much of yourself into work, and right now, that had to be really overwhelming. Add to that whatever ""this"" is, and the emotions tied to it, and that leaves you processing a lot. 

You enjoy helping others, and I really hope you get to keep doing that in this transition. 

You didn't enjoy the book I sent to you, but there are lessons in there that would help you today. First, when it's all overwhelming, just breathe. Tackle one thing, then move to the next thing. Any time the problem in front of you seems too big, just ask yourself, ""what is one thing I can do that may improve this situation?"" Then do it. Stay on that cycle where you are completely in control. Your feelings are valid and it's ok to feel overwhelmed, confused and lost right now. Be gentle with yourself and don't expect perfection. You will find your way through this by remaining true to yourself, even if the path isn't clear at the moment. 

I won't add to it by requesting anything personally. If I was there, I would be taking great care of you. I would bring you SlimFast, coffee, water, and foods you can eat while working. You may get mad at me for some of the things I want to do to you, but I would only offer it so you can release some frustration.

 I love you, and I will always be here if you ever want to talk. 🫡

1kbenwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/TanongLang/comments/1kbenwe/i24m_confessed_my_feelings_to_her23m_months_ago/,"I(24M) confessed my feelings to her(23M) months ago, she still hasn’t given me a clear answer, and she keeps postponing answering. Paano gagawin ko?","

Hello po sa lahat! She (23F) and I (24M) were classmates/friends during college, so we have known each other for a long time, 4 yrs. minimum. We are both from Metro Manila. Apparently, many of our friends knew that I had a crush on her, so they keep urging me confess to her. I have no experience in being in a relationship and I had never confessed to anyone, so I lacked the  courage to confess to her. 

Fast forward to last december during christmas season, she invited our friend group to go to the mall as she was on her way there, luckily I was near there so I told her I was going. It ended with only the two of us meeting up. We had a great time, and we mostly did window shopping and chatted while going through the mall. As we chatted, she suggested going again on Christmas day, and of course I agreed. We did go again at christmas day, and I invited her again on another day to go to a coffee shop. With our meet-ups and ""galaan"", I decided that I should confess my feelings to her. She invited me to go to the mall(a different one) and I decided this was the day I'm going to confess my feelings. On our way home after going to the mall i suggested going to a coffeeshop and there I confessed my feelings and told her I wanted to court her. Well unfortunately I wouldn't be posting here at reddit if my confession went well, lol. She said she couldn't give me an answer, reason being she was an ""INC"" member and I was a Christian and also I was reviewing for an upcoming board exam and didn't want to distract me. I knew our religion would be a problem, but she said it's okay if I didn't convert to her religion as she also thinks it's wrong that I'd have to convert in order to enter a relationship, she was just worried about what her grandparents would say. In the end she told me she would give me an answer after my board examination. 

After that we continued to go to malls and going to coffee shops at least once every other week(we limited are meet-ups as I had to review), we did go out during valentines day. Fast forward to after my board exam our friend group went out for a night swimming, we were with our friends so I didn't get the chance to be alone with her. When we went home I went along with her on her way back to their house. I asked her what was her answer to my confession and if I could get her permission for courting her. I expected that I was going to hear her answer if it was a ""yes"" or ""no"". But unfortunately her answer was ""She needed more time to think about it."" Naturally I was disappointed in her answer, but I replied ""okay lng, hindi naman ako nagmamadali.""  The reason she said she couldn't answer me was because she was going to be taking the next board exam and needed to review. To be honest, I wasn't convinced with that reason, but decided to accept it. 

For the past 4 months since I confessed to her, the thought of her answer really weighed my mind, so to hear that she needed more time really hurt me as if I was rejected. Additionally I noticed that I was always initiating the conversations in our chat at messenger and she seldom started conversation, I told her about this and she replied it's just how she is. When I don't chat her for a whole day she wouldn't chat me but she does reply to me if I started a convo, and sometimes she takes a while to reply. She does agree to go out if I invited her, so I'm really confused about her chats and her agreeing to go out. If she doesn't chat me, I start to think she doesn't care about me, but when going out she does agree. It's not like she isn't active at social media, in fact she shares about at least one or sometimes about 4 posts per day in fb. She also chats in our group chats on days we don't chat, she's okay not chatting me but chats on our gc that I'm a part of. And about her taking the board exam as the reason for postponing her answer, I can't help but think that maybe she thinks as me as a distraction, I mean I took the last boards I can help her in her review. I can't help but think there's another reason.   I've read some posts on reddit about no label relationships and I feel like I'm in a similar situation. As I read some of the posts I start to think maybe I should just stop this but I still really like her. It's not like I'm asking her to be my gf already, I'm just asking her if I can court her. And I feel like I can't even step on the starting line in this situation.

I feel like I should have another conversation with her about our relationship. I don't want to pressure her for an answer, I don't think her answer will be genuine if I rushed her. I want to ask her questions that will assure me about our relationship. What should I ask her and what should I say.",1,1746014379.0,TanongLang,0,1.0,False
1kben7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBookTribunal/comments/1kben7y/the_puppet_masters_bible_by_tom_walker/,The Puppet Master's Bible by Tom Walker,"I didn’t know what to expect when I bought this book but wow… it caught me off guard in the best way. I came across it randomly on Instagram (thank you, algorithm) and something about the title, the boldness of it, just hit me at the right moment. I had just quit my job about a month earlier, not really knowing what was next, but knowing I needed a reset. I wanted to see what the world had to offer, to meet new people, travel, learn, and really find out who I am outside of work, outside of expectations. Just me.

It wasn’t on Amazon and it’s self-published by the author, so I really didn’t know what to expect. Sometimes those things can be hit or miss. But I have to say, the whole process of ordering was really easy and smooth. There was a small delay with shipping, but when I messaged Tom about it, he actually replied himself and sorted it quickly. That meant a lot to me. Everything about the experience felt personal and well taken care of, and the audiobook was just as easy to access and use.

When I went looking for reviews, I didn’t see many that really spoke to me, so I wanted to share my experience in case someone out there is like me and wondering if this book is worth it. From my perspective, someone who’s been through burnout, self-doubt, and a tough breakup, this book was honestly life-changing.

I ordered both the physical copy and the audiobook because being dyslexic means I usually need both to really stay with a book. I ended up switching between the two depending on whether I was driving, walking, or reading in a coffee shop. That flexibility made the whole experience smoother and more enjoyable for me.

From the very beginning, the book made me reflect on how often I’ve been influenced without even realizing it. Especially at work. My old job always pushed this idea of team spirit and doing whatever it takes to help the company grow. What that really meant was staying late, doing unpaid overtime, and being made to feel like you weren’t committed if you said no. It was all wrapped up in nice language, but underneath it, there was pressure and guilt. The kind that makes you second-guess your own boundaries.

And then there was my breakup. Reading this book helped me realize how much of myself I lost in that relationship without even noticing at the time. I was with someone who believed in a very structured and traditional idea of success. He was all about waking up early, reading textbooks, always learning in a way that made sense to him. I’m different. I thrive on creativity. I’m spontaneous, passionate, and I do my best thinking at night. But instead of celebrating that, he made me feel like I wasn’t enough. Like I wasn’t driven or serious because I didn’t do things the way he did.

I didn’t see it at the time, but slowly I started to believe it. That I was lazy. That maybe I didn’t have what it takes. And that’s what makes this book so powerful. It puts language to the things you’ve felt but couldn’t explain. It helps you name the subtle ways people can pull your strings. And it shows you how to take those strings back.

One line that really stuck with me was this

""Real change happens in moments of cognitive dissonance, when someone’s existing beliefs collide violently with new information that can’t be ignored.""

That’s exactly what reading this book felt like. Things I thought were just part of life suddenly looked like manipulation. I could see it clearly. Not just in other people, but also in how I had been letting it happen.

Yes, parts of the book repeat themselves, but honestly, I needed that. It helped things sink in. Sometimes the repetition made the ideas hit even harder. Especially when you’re unlearning beliefs that have been with you for years.

If you’ve ever walked out of a room and second-guessed yourself, if you've ever been made to feel like your instincts were wrong or your energy was too much or not enough, this book will find you where you are. And it will help you take back your voice.

This book helped me trust myself again. It helped me see the moments where I gave my power away, and more importantly, how to start taking it back. If you’ve ever felt like someone made you question who you are, or if you’ve ever walked away from a job, a relationship, or even a conversation feeling small and unsure why, this book is for you.

Highly recommend. Especially if you're at a turning point in your life and you want to finally start living it on your own terms.",1,1746014314.0,TheBookTribunal,0,1.0,False

I stared at the girl before me, and her nervous eyes behind those black rimmed glasses were also set on me. Tentatively, I tucked a strayed strand behind my ear and bit my lip. She mimicked. I blinked, so did she.







""You done with your stare down match with yourself, Em?"" A huff came from behind me. ""For God's sake! You're doing this for the last five minutes! You're creeping me out now!""







I glanced at my best friend through the mirror. With folded arms on her chest, sitting at the edge of my bed, she scowled at me.







My eyes went back to my reflection. ""I don't know, Beth. Do you think he- he'll like my look?""







""After we spent two hours to doll you up? Yes, we think that he'll like your look. And won't reject you when you announce your undying love for him,"" said my other best friend, Casie, standing beside Beth.







Reject. The same word that has been haunting my dreams for years now. I've been waiting for this day for six years. The day he said those words to me. I've been waiting since.







And if he rejects me today… I don't know what I'd do.







flashback\~







""Will you be my prince, Ace? I want to be your princess,"" I'd asked my brother's best friend when he gave me a Cinderella dress on my ninth birthday.







He laughed at my silly question, almost breaking my heart. But then when he saw my crestfallen face, he crouched down before me, looking into my turquoise eyes with his stormy grey. ""You're my princess.""







""Really?"" I brightened up like a Christmas tree. ""That means you will marry me?""







He bit his lip, his eyes lit up with amusement. ""I'm sorry, Rosebud! But I can't.""







""Why not?"" I pouted.







""Because it's not the right time. You're still so young.""







""Then when will be the right time?"" I gazed up at him with so much hope.







""When you turn into a blooming rose from a rose bud.""







End of flashback\~







I'd waited till that day to bloom into a rose. I didn't know what that meant at that moment. But to remember and understand, I'd written those words into my personal diary.







And Casie said at this age we were big enough to have a lover. Well she already had one at the age of fourteen, and is on her fourth at fifteen now.







I knew whatever Ace had said that day was because he didn't want to break a nine year old's naive heart. But I didn't care. I think I was ready to confess my feelings to him today. For real this time.







""Em, you're looking stunning! Though I preferred your long wavy hair. But it's alright, this also suits you,"" commented Beth.







I'd cut my waist length hair to my shoulder and tamed my wild waves into straight. Just like Tess, my sister. She and my brother, Tobias, were twins. So obviously, Ace was her best friend too. And I'd once heard him say that he liked Tess's hair. So I turned my hair just like her. Though hers were blonde where mine was chestnut.







""Short hair is in fashion now. And Ace likes them short,"" I replied, checking my manicured nails. Just like Tess's.







Just like Ace preferred.







All of his girlfriends were just like my sister. Beautiful and classy. Yes, I was jealous of them. But then they all were temporary. Once we'd be together, then there wouldn't be anyone else in his life other than me.







I blushed at the thought.







So I decided to be like them taking inspiration from my sister. Maybe he'd notice me then?







And today's whole makeover was the proof. Dressed like Tess, styled like Tess. I even sneaked her favorite perfume from her room.







""Isn't this dress too short, Casie?"" Though I wanted to wear something like Tess, I was uncomfortable in them. Well she looked good in those tight little dresses. She had a good amount on both front and behind. Where I was flat in both ways. Well, a fifteenth year old couldn't have any more.







""Is not! You're wearing that and that's final! Don't you want to make Ace notice you?"" She raised her brow.







""Fine!"" I said, taking a deep breath. Come on, Em! You can do this!







""Alright, let's go now! Otherwise we will miss you brother and sister's grand entry,"" she chirped, sauntering outside.







Today was my older sibling's nineteenth birthday. And every occasion at Hutton family was known to be grand. So no one wanted to miss this special event. Almost half of the renowned families were invited today.







When we all reached the hall, I kept fidgeting in my place. My hands were clammy and my chest thudded. I was nervous for tonight's meeting with Ace. And my too short dress made me more uncomfortable.







I spotted my dad and mom in the crowd. They stood close to each other, as always. They'd to be always by the hips. Even after twenty years of marriage, they were so madly in love with each other.







And that made me hope. If I and Ace would be like that someday…







""Emmy!"" Mom's voice broke my daydream.







I smiled and padded towards them.







""Oh my! Look at you! My little baby looks so beautiful today!"" she gushed, her smile blinding.







""You think?"" I blushed.







""Of course, baby! You should do it more!""







Dad stayed quiet. He didn't seem to be pleased with me dressing up like that. Opposite of my nature.







""You didn't like the gown I brought for you, princess?"" he asked.







I did. Very much. But Ace wouldn't like that.







""Of course I did, Dad! But… I couldn't find matching jewelry with it,"" I lied.







He nodded his head.







Mom had a knowing look on. She knew, everyone knew of my crush on Achilles Valencian. But they didn't know that it was more than just a mare crush.







He became my dream prince from the day he stepped into our house with Tobis when I was just seven. I still remembered that day clearly in my vague memories. But the day he saved me from some bullies in my school, he became my hero. And with time, he became my heart.







I stopped the urge to cover my flushed cheeks.







Where was he?







I looked around. He should've been here by now. Last month when he played chess with me, he'd promised me he'd be here tonight. And he never broke his promises to me.







He used to come here everyday. But after the tragedy his family faced a year ago, his visit in our home had lessened. He changed. Carefree playful Ace turned into a lost and always angry Ace. But he was always soft with me though. He'd come and see us once a month. And of course, to play chess with me.







The crowd cheered as Tess and Tobias climbed down the stairs in a dramatic way with the spotlight on them. In a pink mid-thigh fairy dress, Tess looked like a real fairy, when Tobias looked good in his black tux. They smiled down at the cameras and everyone as their group of friends clapped and whistled wildly.



But there wasn't still any sign of Ace.







Excusing myself, I aimlessly wandered around the people.







Where are you?







""Oww!""







Colliding into a hard chest, I stumbled back. A pair of arms circled around my waist.





**Chapter 2**



""I'm so so…"" Looking up, my breath hitched at my throat.







Stormy grey eyes stared down at me. His dense stubbles were gone, showing his chiseled jaw. Jet black hair gelled back and the ring on his right brow wasn't there today. Even though there were dark shadows under his beautiful eyes, and he'd lost some weight than before, he still looked breathtaking.







""Rosebud?"" His forehead creased as he straightened me on my feet. His eyes roamed up and down my body, his lips tightening. ""What're you wearing?"" Greek accent in his voice came deep.







And it happened whenever he was angry.







My eyes widened. Didn't he like my appearance?







""Uh, why? Don't I look good?"" I bit my lip. ""I thought you'd like it.""







His frown deepened as he watched my hair and heavy make-up. But then he shook his head. ""You don't need my approval in anything, Emerald. It's your choice to whatever you want to wear."" With that, he walked away.







My heart fell.







I looked down at myself. Was anything wrong with my look? Why was he so distant?







He has been like this since his Dad died. Our families weren't that close, they always preferred their privacy. So no one really knew what happened to his dad. But whatever happened, it changed my Ace drastically. And it made my heart ache for him.







Running upstairs, I changed into the white gown Dad had brought me and removed my makeup. Once satisfied with my new neutral look, I headed back downstairs.



Ignoring Casie and Beth's raised brows, I went to find Ace again.







My brother and sister were busy chatting with their friends, but he wasn't there.







""Hey, Em!"" Tobias called out.







Smiling, I walked to them.







""Aren't you forgetting something, little sis?""







Chuckling, I hugged him tight. ""Happy birthday!""







He lifted me off the ground, getting a squeal out of me. ""Where is my gift?"" he asked, once he put me down.







Tobias loved his birthday gift from me. Actually, he loved the red velvet cake I baked him since I honed my skills in baking. And so did Ace.







""You will get it after the party. It's in the fridge,"" I replied, my eyes going back to the crowd for a moment.







And there he was, standing at a corner, beside a table. With a drink in his hand, he looked deep in thought.







""Happy birthday!"" Wrapping my arms around Tess, I wished her.







""Thanks!"" She pulled back. ""You changed?"" Her eyes raked over my gown.







Mark, a boy in their group slapped on Ace's back, greeting him. But he ignored him. And when Mark went to reach for the glass in his hand, Ace shot him a sharp look, making him back away.







""Uh, yeah! That dress was slightly uncomfortable,"" I said absentmindedly. My eyes set on him. ""I will be back just in a minute.""







When I went to move, she caught my arm and dragged me away from her friends' earshots. ""You're going to confess tonight, aren't you?""







I let out a surprised gasp. How did she know?







""Don't,"" she said in a sharp voice. ""You will only be heartbroken.""







Frowning, I snatched my arm from her grip. ""How do you know? Who knows, maybe he likes me too.""







""Don't be foolish, Em! Just because he is soft with you doesn't mean he harbors any kind of feelings for you."" Her voice was harsh. ""And you and I both know he only cares for you as a brother, not a lover. So don't embarrass him with your stupidness. He is already disturbed with his own problems.""







Her words stung. I always feared that his kindness towards me might be just a brotherly love. But deep down, I felt there was more than that. It may be stupid and nonsense, but my heart told me not to lose hope.







I won't know unless I confront him, right?







""I won't embarrass him. And you don't know everything. So why don't you just go and enjoy your party and let me be on my own?"" My tone matched hers.







Her blue eyes flashed. ""Stay away from him, Emerald. He isn't the one for you.""







Now my anger flared. ""I will do whatever the hell I want, Tess. It's none of your business! So, leave me alone!"" Turning on my heels, I strode away.







Once I'd padded closer to where Ace stood, I took a calming breath and smoothed my hair. No one can stop me from telling you my feelings today.







""Hey!"" My voice came out meek, gone the confidence into the air. Nervousness fluttered in my tummy.







His grey eyes lifted to mine. This time his gaze didn't hold displease. But there wasn't any pleasure either. They were just, cold.







He was actually in a bad mood. Should I do it today? But It had taken me so much courage to make up my mind. I didn't know if I could have that much guts anytime soon.







""Won't you play chess with me today, Ace? I've been waiting for another match.""







Maybe after the game, his mood turns good?







He thought for a second and then nodded his head. ""Yeah, that sounds good. This party is boring me anyway.""







My grin was face splitting. ""Alright, let me go and ready the board. In the library, as usual?""







He nodded, taking a sip. ""I will be up in a few.""







Failing to contain my excitement, I threw my arms around his neck and hugged him tight. His exotic scent with a tinge of smoke, made me giddy. ""I will be waiting for you.""







My sudden act caught him off guard as he stood stiff. His touch on my back was almost non-existent. Inhaling a deep breath, he pulled me away by my shoulders. His lips in a straight line as he said, ""Go!""







Nodding my head, I skipped off to our small library and started to make the board ready for play. I could barely contain myself from dancing around. I was finally going to tell him.







Tell him that I love him.







Ten minutes passed, and he wasn't still up. Then it turned into twenty. And there wasn't any sign of him. I even missed the cake cutting so that he wouldn't have to wait if he came here.







He said he'd be here in a few.







Letting out a sigh, I got up and went downstairs again. The party was going on in a full swing. Most elders retired for tonight and there were only the youngers, dancing and drinking wildly.







I spotted Cassie dancing with my brother, and Beth drank with some girls. But I couldn't see him anywhere. The loud music and sharp smell of alcohol almost made me gag.







Where is he?







Making my way through the half wasted dancing population, I padded towards the balcony. But he wasn't even there. Did he forget about our match and left already?



But he never forgets our match.







Sighing in disappointment, I decided to go back up to my room. Maybe another day.







Just when I turned to go, I heard something. Some strange noises. I hadn't fully entered inside the balcony, I stood at the doorway.



Curious, I slowly moved inside and looked at my right.







I froze.







My heart stopped in my chest as my breath hitched at my throat. My hands shook at my sides, as I took in the sight before me.







His hands were wrapped tightly around her waist and hers were around his neck; one hand tugged at his hair as their mouth worked on each other in a passionate kiss. Not even an inch of space left between them.







Their every moan and groan hit my heart like thousand stabs of knives, shattering it into millions of pieces. My feet stumbled back, tears fell from my eyes.







His hands roamed around her body as he pulled her more close. My heart squeezed so hard that I had to clutch my chest. A sob threatened to escape my lips but I slapped a hand over my mouth and ran away.







I ran and ran until I was inside my room. Closing the door behind me, I let out an agonized sob. Tears blinded my vision as I still had a hand on my chest that pained physically.







I felt my insides breaking, falling into irreparable pieces.







I heard my best friends knocking on my door, their concerned voices reached my ears. But I couldn't speak, I couldn't move. All I could do was, lie on the floor in my dark room and cry my heart out.







The visions of them tangled around each other's arms flashed across my mind again and again, making it hurt more.







He didn't know, but she did. Her betrayal just intensified the pain more. Betrayal of others could be tolerated, but betrayal of loved ones wasn't.







How could she do this to me? How?







I stayed on the cold floor for the entire night, cradling my heart, mourning the loss of my love.







The love my own sister took away from me.

**Chapter 3**



I glanced at my wrist.







Nine-thirty.







""Ma'am, please turn off your cell phone. The plane is about to take off,"" said the flight attendant in her angelic voice.







""Yeah, just a minute."" I threw her an apologetic look.







Nodding her head, she walked away.







""Mom, I need to hang up now. The crews have already warned me for the second time.""







""Alright, alright! I will let you go now. You're coming to me in some hours anyway. We will be waiting outside the airport when you'll land!"" Excitement dripped from her voice.







A sudden homesickness filled my mind. It's been two years since I met them.







""And keep that boy at an arm's length,"" Dad called out in the background.







Shaking my head, I let out a chuckle. ""Alright guys! I will see you at the airport.""







""Love you, honey!"" they exclaimed together.







""Love you too!""







Sighing, I looked out of the window. Another plane took off the runway, flying high in the sky.







It'd always fascinated me. Though I always struggled with myself not to flip during the taking offs.







A figure slumped beside me, making me turn my head. Letting out a huff, he settled against the seat.







""How's your stomach now?"" I asked, seeing the perspiration on his forehead and flushed cheeks.







""Not good. I shouldn't have eaten the leftover macaroni last night. God! I swear! I won't ever touch leftovers again."" He groaned.







Poor guy! Even in this crisis, he had agreed to come with me to my home.







""I'm so sorry, Warner. You have to travel with me in this state. You should've stayed back, you know?""







He flashed me a boyish smile. ""Don't be. It was my decision to tag along even after knowing my condition this morning.""







""But it was me who asked you to come with me,"" I said, guilt crashed on me.







""Don't be silly. I can do anything for you. And this is just a slightly uncomfortable journey. And it will go away just in a day. I've already taken medicines."" He grasped my hand, entwining our fingers.







I smiled, a grateful one.







""I love you,"" he said, looking at my eyes.







The smile threatened to fall, but I managed to keep it on and squeezed his hand in return. The announcement of the flight attendant for every passenger to fasten their seat belts, saved me from another awkward situation.







We've been dating for six months now. And known each other since I joined college. We were good friends from the beginning. After my several failures at keeping up on dating a guy for more than a week, I gave up on kindling any kind of relationship with anyone. And when Warner one day asked me out at a friend's get-together, I couldn't put him down.







He was everything a girl would want in an ideal boyfriend. Handsome, intelligent, humble, honest. And most importantly, he knew me so well. After all, we've been friends for three years now. So when he'd asked me to be his girlfriend, I had said yes.







But even if he'd confessed his feelings for thousands of times before me, I couldn't just bring myself to reciprocate. It's not that I didn't like him, I did. He was a great guy. Maybe it'd take some more time for me to feel that deep for him. And I was waiting for that day.







""Ma'am, would you like some coffee?"" The air hostess' voice broke my trance.







""Do you have tea?""







\*\*\*







After a long four and a half hours later when we finally landed in California, I found my parents right where they told me they would be. Holding a placard that said 'welcome home', Mom met me with her more than usual enthusiastic hug, where Dad had a satisfacted look in his eyes now that I finally came home. Though it was just for two weeks until I would go back.







From the day I decided to shift to NY for my high school, he took the world of worry for me on his shoulders. They both did. It wasn't easy for me to stay that far from them, but it'd have been more difficult for me to stay here in this city.







I needed time to heal myself. So the distance was necessary. As soon as the memories of that night started to flood in, I shut off my mind, burying them at the pit of my brain. Just like I did for the last seven years.







I've moved on.







""Welcome home, little mouse!"" The moment I stepped into the threshold, I was tackled into a bone-crushing hug. ""Look at ya! You've grown up!""







I rolled my eyes at my brother. ""You just met me two months ago.""







""Yeah, but it feels like ages since I irritated you,"" he said, eyes warm with nostalgia.







I smiled. I've missed him. Even though he visited me often in NY whenever he was on his business trips.







""You better keep your stupid ass away from me, I'm warning you!"" I feigned a serious look.







He chuckled, and then his gaze fell on Warner who looked blue in the face from his marathon to washrooms in every ten minutes. He seemed at the verge of fainting at any moment. He was extremely embarrassed when he had to run for the washroom before he could even shake Dad's hand.







Way to impress my parents!







I wanted their first meeting to be good. And Dad couldn't dislike him anymore for that.







'He is too good to be true', Dad had said once on the phone. I didn't know why, but he didn't approve of him the moment he heard us dating.







""Hey, Warner! It's good to see you, man!"" Tobias gave him a side hug. ""You alright though? You look sick.""







""Nothing serious, just have a stomach bug. And it's nice to see you too."" Suddenly his expression twisted like someone had punched him in the gut. ""Uh, if you don't mind…""







""Go right and then straight up, the first door. You will find the guest room,"" said Dad with a displeased tone.







Heaving a 'thank you', he ran inside.



I sighed.







I will have to talk to Dad about this. Though Warner didn't notice his tone now, he'd soon.

1kbeh8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1kbeh8h/how_to_taper_off_almost_daily_cetirizine_usage/,How to taper off almost daily Cetirizine usage,"Hi all Ive recently discovered this group and looking for some advice. I randomly started needing antihistamines about 15 years ago due to a subtle itch I feel all over my body. I took daily but then got down to half a tablet every 2-3 days. 

I was on a long term high dose of antibiotics when I was 18 and then went on some heavy binge drinking holidays until I was 20 when I developed the itch. The drinking holidays were mostly 6 weeks at a time (one was 3 months) were I was getting drunk nearly daily. The 6 week holidays were in tropical places so I was taking malaria tablets too (antibiotic type) when I had my first flare up. 

I’m 36 now and have been undiagnosed, despite going to allergy consultants. My prick test came back as clear. So I just lived with it. In the past year I’ve had to take quite a lot of antibiotics again and some high strength ones and this has played havoc on my gut (yellow acidic stool, leaky gut etc). 

For the first time I was having bloating and reaction to food I could normally handle eg coffee or sweets and milk. 

So now I want to go on a low histamine diet and build up my gut lining again with a plan. 

I’ve learned it could be other things like MCAS? And also that antihistamines have a rebound affect. 

What would be the right plan and protocol to test and come off my antihistamines considering the rebound and the fact I don’t know if it’s HI or MCAS. Any advice is highly appreciated.

1kbefw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kbefw5/could_the_bodum_34oz_spare_carafe_for_french/,Could the Bodum 34oz Spare Carafe for French Press Review Improve Your Coffee?,"The **Bodum 1508-10 34oz Spare Carafe for French Press** is a product I’ve recently had the chance to test thoroughly, and it’s a lifesaver for French press coffee lovers like me. My mornings begin with freshly pressed coffee, and this 34oz borosilicate glass replacement beaker turned out to be an invaluable addition to my kitchen arsenal. Whether you’ve accidentally shattered your previous carafe or want to keep a spare one handy, this product has a lot going for it, but there are a few considerations too.

**Durability and Material Quality**  
What instantly stood out to me was the product's material: borosilicate glass. This isn’t your ordinary glass; it’s high-heat resistant and doesn’t crack under pressure (literally). I’m a bit of a klutz, so durability is super important for me. The glass feels thick and sturdy in hand, a reassuring presence as I go about my coffee ritual. Compared to cheaper French press carafes I’ve used before, this one seems like it could withstand both the dishwasher and my accident-prone tendencies without any trouble.  

[Check Bodum 1508-10 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0000cf2wm/)  

**Compatibility Features**  
A key selling point is its universal compatibility with all Bodum eight-cup, 34-ounce coffee presses. I was skeptical at first—since I own an older French press model—but it fit like a glove. The circumference and size (7 inches tall and 3.75 inches in diameter) match all listed specifications, ensuring a seamless fit. I also used it as a replacement for a random off-brand French press, and while it wasn’t a perfect fit, it got the job done in a pinch.  

**Ease of Cleaning**  
After every brew, I like things to be easy to clean because, truth be told, I loathe prolonged dishwashing. This carafe being dishwasher-safe? Absolute chef’s kiss. Whether it was soaked coffee grounds or the occasional stubborn coffee oil residue, this replacement carafe cleaned up so well in the dishwasher that it looked as if I had just unboxed it every time.  

**Pros**  
- High-heat resistant borosilicate glass for enhanced durability.  
- Universal compatibility with all Bodum 34oz French presses.  
- Dishwasher-safe for effortless cleaning.  

**Flaws**  
- Lacks a lid, requiring you to use the one from your existing press.  
- Higher price point compared to generic carafe replacements.  

**Performance During Brewing**  
This carafe truly shines where it matters—in coffee brewing. I was pleasantly surprised by its heat retention. On mornings when I needed to step away for a few minutes, the temperature of my coffee stayed consistent for longer than I expected, no doubt a testament to its borosilicate build. The shape, too, is round and smooth, making it easy to pour without spills. That said, using coarser coffee grounds resulted in no issues with pressing, but I noticed finer grounds needed extra care to prevent residue inside the carafe post-brew.  

**Compared to Peer Products**  
While Bodum’s genuine replacement carafe checks a lot of boxes, I’ve tried other cheaper options before. A similar replacement I used earlier cracked after a few uses due to heat fluctuations—something I haven’t had to worry about with this one. However, brands like Grosche and Mueller offer somewhat similar products, often at lower costs. The trade-off is their compatibility and durability, which leaves room for error. With the availability of so many options, this product’s perfect fit and tough material do give it an edge, but the cost might deter some budget-conscious buyers.  

**Price Worthiness**  
Is it worth the investment? I think it depends on what you prioritize. Paying a slightly higher price guarantees a high-quality product and long-term reliability, whereas cutting corners might save you money upfront but cause headaches later on when poor materials inevitably fail. For the features provided—durability, precision fit, heat-resistance, and dishwasher convenience—I’d say it justifies its cost quite comfortably.

I was on 150 mg of Wellbutrin alone for a month two years ago and my depression got worse, so we added 10 mg of Lexapro and my life changed. My depression decreased but also my anxiety! Which has been wonderful tbh.

I am going through some life transitions and my psychiatrist thought of increasing my Wellbutrin to 300 mg to help with motivation. I am on day 5, and besides my sleeping quality getting worse, I am feeling anxious again at the point of not wanting to have coffee in the mornings, which is very very unusual for me. 

Would my anxiety go back to it was before (low) after a couple of weeks? Any experiences to share? I have an appointment in a few weeks with my doc to make a game plan, I am just anxious lol about this.

Look up what carnivore actually is, do actual carnivore for at least 1 month strict, then slowly add in all the other garbage you're still addicted to.

I looked out of the airplane window. Below the white clouds, the endless coastline sparkled like silk in the sunlight. That's where I was about to land, a warm and leisurely paced city.

Before I departed, the Headmistress of the orphanage told me, ""You'll surely love everything about this place, Faye. There's sunshine, a coastline, citrus trees, and most importantly, your mother and her new home.""

Indeed, my mother lived here, in the largest werewolf pack in Santan State - the Silver Moon Pack. She was the Luna of the Silver Moon Pack.

While the plane was taxiing down the runway, my heart also surged with emotions. I was about to meet my mother, and nervousness began to creep in.

This was the closest time I had been to the concept of ""home"" in my 17 years. Although I always referred to the friends and teachers at the orphanage as my family, over the years, my ""home"" had been constantly changing. When I was young, I witnessed my friends being found by their biological parents, and some were adopted as the ""lucky ones"" to be taken in by new families, starting their new lives. The teachers who cared for us were also changing - some left the orphanage, others retired due to age. In general, the orphanage was a place of constant change.

The fear and disappointment of change and loss reached a peak this year, the summer before my 18th birthday.

Throughout my academic years, my grades have always been good. This summer, I finally received an offer letter from a university. But there was a problem. I needed money to pay for my tuition. And I didn't have much money. In other words, I was quite poor.

I dug out the piggy bank I had been collecting since childhood, searched through all my physical books, and surprisingly found several bills of varying amounts. I also retrieved all my bank cards from different bags. In the end, I realized my total assets were $3812.68.

And taking into account my daily expenses at college, this money was far from enough. Anxiety and turmoil started to build up within me. On one hand, I wanted to continue my education, but on the other hand, this money was a collection of rewards I received at the orphanage and money I earned from part-time jobs during the holidays. At that moment, I was acting like the miser Harpagon, trying to distribute my entire wealth to maximize its use. Yet, I was still disheartened by the realization that the money just wasn't enough.

My second thought was to seek help from Headmistress Annie. She always told us that we could come to her with any difficulties. I believed she would help me.

I carefully put away my piggy bank, paper money, and bank cards, then went to find Annie in her office.

The office door was ajar. I walked to the entrance and heard someone arguing with Annie.

""Annie, I have three kids to support. The wages here are too low. Can you consider giving me a pay raise?"" It was Susan, the teacher in charge of the younger age group!

Annie sighed, and then I heard the sound of her using a calculator.

""Susan, look! These are this month's expenses for the orphanage. The perimeter fence needs repairs, or it could be dangerous. The children's food, clothes, medical checkups, and your salaries... I really don't have much money left...""

Susan's voice sounded angry, disappointed, and mostly resigned. ""Well then, Annie, I might have to consider finding a new job. I love the children here, but I can't ignore my own children, sorry.""

The office fell into silence. Just as I thought they had noticed me, Annie spoke softly, ""Susan, if you've truly made up your mind, I agree to your resignation.""

Her voice sounded tired and weary.

I didn't enter the office; instead, I turned back to my dormitory.

I took out my offer letter from the drawer and stared at the thin piece of paper. I don't know how long it took, maybe just a few seconds, but it felt like an eternity of inner struggle.

I made up my mind and started tearing the offer letter up. I tore it in half first, then tore the halves into quarters.

I choked up. In my blurry vision, I saw tears drop onto the torn pieces of my offer letter, and finally, I burst into tears.

Everyone was dealing with their own difficult lives. Susan, Headmistress Annie. They faced challenges, and no one could help me in my life except myself.

Now my offer letter had turned into pieces of scrap paper, which meant I had no university to attend. Well, fuck university! I wiped my tears and, as an almost-adult she-wolf, I had to rely on myself. I believed I could take care of myself. I would work, earn money, and then start my new life with plenty of savings to go back to university.

Now, the first challenge before me wasn't about how to go to university, but rather, how to earn money? Honestly, this wasn't a particularly difficult thing for me, as I had a lot of experience working part-time during summers. However, the point now was that I needed a job that could sustain me in the long term.

I reflected on the part-time jobs I had done in the past few years. Convenience store clerk – oh, that was so boring. Restaurant server – no, there were too many unreasonable customers there! The best option I could think of was to work at Uncle Simon's café. Uncle Simon was a good person. He had been a longtime friend of our orphanage. When I was very young, he cared a lot about us. To earn some pocket money, I used to work at his café frequently. Uncle Simon often praised me for making good coffee and he said having me around saved him from hiring two more part-timers.

When I told him about my decision, he was surprised that I was giving up on going to university. He offered to sponsor me, but I politely declined. Uncle Simon had heart problems, and I knew he spent a lot on medical bills each year. I couldn't add to his burden.

Besides, I didn't tell him that I had torn up my offer letter. I didn't have a second chance unless I managed to earn enough money within a few years. I suggested that I wanted to work at his café. Uncle Simon agreed, and I smoothly became an intern barista at Simon's Café.

The café job was very scheduled, which was relaxing and enjoyable for me. I loved the process of making coffee. Sometimes, I would be happy for half an hour just because I managed to create an intricate pattern on a customer's coffee.

I also had to occasionally organize the shelves, like I was doing now. I was dealing with some expired coffee beans, and then I'd move the fresh ones onto the shelves, and so on. This job is somewhat challenging for me now, as lifting a sack of coffee beans was tough. I didn't have my wolf yet, so my strength wasn't much better than that of a regular human girl.

Apart from me, the other regular baristas were busy at the front counter, and I didn't intend to ask for their help. I first tried to move the bag of coffee beans to beneath the shelf. I exerted all my strength, bent down, and lifted the whole bag of beans off the ground.

It was really heavy, much heavier than I anticipated. It almost slipped from my hands. Quickly, I lifted one leg and used my knee to support the bag, then gritting my teeth, I hoisted the bag up to my chest. I panted, making sure the bag of coffee beans maintained a delicate balance in my hands. I needed to place it on the second shelf.

The second shelf was slightly above my head. Oh god! I was 5.57 inches tall, not short by any means, but who in the world designed shelves like this? I took a deep breath and exerted force again, attempting to lift the bag to the height of my head. Suddenly, the pocket next to my thigh vibrated, emitting an annoying ringing sound. I was startled, and then something unexpected happened.

The bag was about to slam into my face. I was going to be buried in coffee beans.

""Watch out!""

A man's exclamation came from behind me, followed by two strong arms enveloping me from behind, trying to help lift the bag. But it was too late. The bag of coffee beans fiercely collided with me.

I was so frightened that I forgot to scream, and I stumbled backwards. The man moved incredibly fast, turning around to tightly embrace me, using his back to take the weight of the coffee beans.

""Ugh..."" I heard a muffled groan.

""Are you okay?"" I asked with a trembling voice. Was he hurt?

The man in front of me moved his head slightly to the side, and his coarse hair brushed against my face. Both of our necks were sweaty, and our bodies emitted heat. We were breathing heavily, like two chestnuts roasted in the fire, on the brink of bursting.

Then he lifted his head. I saw a pair of deep blue eyes, captivating and enchanting. His features were as delicate as ancient Greek sculptures. My chest was still heaving heavily, but at that moment, I was captivated.

He gave a slight shake of his head, and I snapped back to reality. ""Oh, I'm fine... Are you okay?""

He chuckled lightly, revealing a set of perfectly white teeth. ""I'm fine too!""

He was the first to stand up. The warmth that had been above me suddenly disappeared, and I even felt a bit disappointed and regretful, as if the closeness hadn't been enough.

He reached out a hand toward me, who was still lying on the ground, and I placed my hand in his palm, just like holding the hand of a knight who had saved me. His hand was large, almost enveloping mine completely. His palm was dry and warm, his fingers long and calloused.

Using his strength, I managed to stand up and patted the dirt off my clothes. The man said, ""Your colleague is coming, so I'll be on my way. Be careful next time, and you can always ask someone for help.""

I felt a bit embarrassed and mumbled in a low voice, ""I used to handle this on my own.""

I didn't want him to think I was weak!

He was about to say something else when Uncle Simon rushed over. ""Sweetheart, what happened here? Are you both alright?""

""Uncle Simon, I'm okay. It's just that some coffee beans spilled...""

""Your coworker is here, so I'll leave now. Just be safe during work."" The man winked at me and left. I watched his departing figure, regretting not thanking him properly.

Uncle Simon gently scolded me in a mild tone, but he helped me gather the scattered coffee beans and advised me to ask the male baristas for help with moving the coffee beans in the future.

I tidied up the remaining coffee beans. Sitting in a squat made my lower back ache a bit. I rubbed my lower back, stood up with a sigh, and headed to the café entrance for some fresh air.

As I pushed the door open, the man who had rescued me walked past me.

He looked completely different from before. He wasn't wearing sporty casual clothes anymore. Now, he was dressed in a dark suit, emanating an air of dominance and coldness. His hairstyle had changed too, appearing more mature than before.

""Hey, you...""

I couldn't help but call out to him.

The man turned to glance at me from the side. His gaze behind the glasses seemed unfamiliar and quizzical.

I stood there puzzled, not knowing what to say. He didn't pay me any attention, held a cup of coffee, and walked away.

Could they be twins?

**Chapter 2 A New Home**

Faye's POV

I stared at the back of that man in a daze. My phone rang again at that moment. I suddenly realized that after the accident, I hadn't checked my phone. I answered the call, and it was the voice of Headmistress Annie.

""Hi, what's up, Headmistress?""

""Faye, I have good news!""

What? Good news? I wasn't excited at all. What could it be? I pondered with boredom. Could someone be willing to sponsor my university education? Other than that, I didn't know what else could qualify as ""good news"" for me at that point.

I feigned excitement to go along with Annie, even though I didn't really care about what the good news was. Annie exclaimed excitedly, ""Faye, your biological mother has found you! Where are you now? Come back quickly. We have a lot to prepare!""

WAIT!

""Annie, please say that again!"" I could barely hold my phone, my hands trembling heavily. Wasn't I abandoned? Why would my biological mother suddenly appear?

Annie explained, ""There seems to have been a misunderstanding, but I can assure you that your biological mother has indeed found you, and she's living well now. She can offer you a better life too.""

Upon hearing this, I started to feel angry. My biological mother? What did that woman mean? After enjoying 18 years of her life, did she suddenly remember she had a lost daughter?

Annie seemed to sense my anger and she reassured me over the phone. ""Dear, don't think that your mother abandoned you. In fact, I only found out that she got separated from you due to some unexpected circumstances. Faye, listen to me, come back quickly, and I'll explain everything to you from start to finish!""

Annie hung up the phone, and she had given me an order.

I stared at my phone, couldn't help but mutter a curse under my breath.

If I were 8 years old, I would be thrilled to hear this news. I would jump up and down in places. For a child who grew up without parents, Annie's words were the best news in the world. She had finally found her biological mother, who would offer her a new family, a prosperous life, and a bright future.

But now I was almost 18, on the brink of adulthood, and I had just torn up my university offer letter. I had been supporting myself through work and trying to save money for college. At that moment, my biological mother appeared!

I suddenly didn't know how to approach this situation. Yet, my brain seemed to be under a spell, immediately imagining my biological mother. What kind of person was she? Did she look like me? What kind of life was she living now? Did she have a new family? Did she have other children?

My thoughts were all over the place, but I had to follow Annie's command. I asked Uncle Simon for a leave of absence and hurried back to the orphanage.

I headed straight to Headmistress Annie's office, where she had prepared all the materials for me. She told me a story about a baby getting lost from her biological mother.

18 years ago, a young girl named Elena met a man. They weren't each other's mates, but they chose to be together. Just as they were about to become chosen mates, the man found his fated mate and abandoned Elena. It was then that Elena discovered she was pregnant. She couldn't bear having an abortion, but she didn't have much money, so she ended up giving birth at a small hospital.

After Elena gave birth to the child, the small hospital suddenly caught fire. She was rescued in a hurry and was told that the hospital had completely collapsed, with a few infant bodies found in the ruins, possibly including her child's. Overwhelmed by grief, Elena refused to believe her newborn child had died. For several days, she wandered around the ruins, asking anyone she met for clues. However, she never found her child. Meanwhile, she met a man, her fated mate. He saved Elena in her darkest moment and took her to his pack.

""The protagonist of this story is your mother. She's now living in the Silver Moon Pack, the largest pack in Santan State. The man is the Alpha of the Silver Moon Pack, and your mother is his Luna."" Annie finished telling the whole story.

This story left me shocked for a long time. I never imagined I had such a complex background.

""So, where is she now?"" I asked Annie, referring to my biological mother. I'm sorry, but I couldn't call her ""mother"" at that point. The weight of that word was still too heavy for me.

I looked around, wondering if she might be in the room, listening to my conversation with Annie. Annie could tell what I was thinking and said, ""Don't worry, your mother isn't here. She told me that she would respect your choice. You can meet her, or she can come to meet you. She's open to either. She's concerned that her sudden appearance might startle you or cause you stress.""

My tensed shoulders relaxed, but there was also a trace of disappointment spreading within me. So, she really wasn't here. After hearing that story, my anger towards my biological mother had lessened quite a bit. Honestly, I did want to meet her.

""Don't be disappointed, dear,"" Annie told me. At the same time, she handed me a small pink envelope.

Seeing my puzzled expression, Annie pushed the envelope into my hand. ""Open it. It's a letter from your mother.""

Suddenly, the letter felt heavy in my hands. I hesitated to open it. But I finally unfolded the thin paper inside. It read:

""Dear Faye, I am your biological mother, Elena. I feel fortunate to have found you and am soon going to have you. I hope you can forgive me for not being there to care for you for the past 18 years.""

""I've talked to Headmistress Annie. I really hope you can come and live with me. I have a happy family now. I can provide you with a comfortable life. Soon, you'll get to know your two twin brothers. They are my stepsons, along with your sister, my new child. I believe you'll like them, and they'll like you too.""

""I don't know if you're willing to see me now. If you are, I'll come to you as soon as possible. If you need some time to accept this, that's okay too. I've left some money for you. When you decide you're ready to meet me, you can come find me.""

""Love you, mom.""

It was a short letter, and from it, I only got a basic idea of her family. Those words about happiness stung me a bit. But the atmosphere of a family's warmth that seeped through the lines also made me yearn for it greatly.

I looked at the envelope again and found a small photo inside. I pulled it out. It seemed to be a picture of my biological mother, Elena. Seeing her for the first time, I couldn't help but marvel at the magic of genetics. Elena and I really looked alike! We both had red hair. Hers seemed smooth and gentle, while mine was like a wild lion's mane on my head. I had to tie it to a braid that hung down my chest. We both had emerald green eyes and scattered freckles on our cheeks and noses.

This photo won me over. A few days later, oh, today actually, I chose to take a plane to the city where my mother was. In my 18 years of life in the orphanage, I rarely had the money to travel by plane. My mother even arranged for me to travel first class. I had never experienced first class before, and I was curious.

As the plane landed, I reluctantly left the first-class cabin. The unknown awaited me next. I didn't yet know how to greet my mother and her family. How are we going to get along in the future? What if we argue? Or if I didn't like her current family? I knew she had stepsons and a daughter with her current husband. Perhaps this could be my last chance to experience the first class.

With a jumble of thoughts, I collected my luggage, which contained all my documents from the orphanage, as well as my belongings—a few cheap clothes and some dolls that had kept me company. They were worn out, but I insisted on bringing them to Santan State. Oh, there were also letters exchanged with my friends.

I hadn't mentioned any of this to my close friend Sibyl. Everything happened too suddenly, and she was busy studying new magical courses in the forest to become an advanced witch. I thought I would tell her about my situation after I met my biological mother and got to know her better.

I walked toward the exit with the crowd. Many people were standing outside the railing, waiting to greet arriving passengers. I looked around, hoping to find a sign with my name, but there wasn't any sign with ""Faye"" written on it.

I suppressed my disappointment and sighed silently. But in the next second, I consoled myself. My flight had arrived early, so the person coming to pick me up might still be on the way. They should be arriving soon.

The long flight left me somewhat thirsty. I found a coffee shop. It was a familiar place that gave me a sense of security. I thought I needed a cup of coffee to clear my mind.

I checked my messages on my phone as I walked into the coffee shop. Suddenly, I was bumped into someone and staggered a few steps back. The pain in my shoulder made me grimace.

""Ah…"" I couldn't help but let out a pained cry.

I looked up and saw a familiar face. A pair of deep blue eyes like the sea, and a face like a sculpture.

**Chapter 3 Stepbrothers**

Faye's POV

He's the one who helped me that day at Uncle Simon's café! But wait! Something's different! He's not the man who saved me; he's the man I met outside the café!

""You bumped into me,"" I rubbed my shoulder.

Those blue eyes stared at me calmly. ""I'm sorry, but I need to correct you. We bumped into each other. Besides, I think you should take more responsibility than me..."" His gaze shifted to my phone. ""You were walking with your head down, looking at your phone.""

Under his stern gaze, I felt a blush rising from my neck. My face began to heat up, but I didn't want to give in. ""Alright, you're right, I apologize to you. But you should apologize to me too. You hurt me.""

""Sorry. If you're in pain, I can take you to the hospital after I find the person I'm looking for.""

Unexpectedly, this man, though serious, had a good attitude.

Was he here to pick someone up? I instinctively looked down and noticed he was holding a sign. Now, the sign is stained with coffee.

Wait, that name... it's so familiar! 

FAYE WILLIAMS. It's me!!

I pointed at the sign. ""Are you looking for this person?""

The man scrutinized me. ""How did you know..."" His voice suddenly trailed off. He froze. ""Are you Faye Williams?""

""Yes, yes. I am Faye Williams.""

It was as if a wet cotton ball had blocked my throat, and I couldn't produce any more words.

Wait, could he be my mother's stepson?

Everything lit up like a lightbulb.

""Then which one are you? Which one of the twins?""

The man gave me a faint smile. ""I'm Liam Shaffield. Welcome home.""

Then he took my luggage from my hand. I felt a bit embarrassed, and at the same time, I wondered about his brother. Shouldn't twins be together?

Liam seemed to read my thoughts. ""Leander is waiting in the car. His status is somewhat special ...""

At the same time, I saw a huge billboard in the terminal. It featured an athlete in football gear, and his name was Leander Shaffield.

I almost immediately realized that Leander was Liam's brother. Liam noticed me pausing and followed my gaze. ""Yes, Leander is a football player. He's too famous, not convenient to be in the crowd.""

As he explained, a tall, muscular man in all-black clothing with a low-brimmed cap shouted in our direction from afar, ""Liam!""

Even though he was dressed in all black, with the cap's brim pulled low, some people still recognized him in an instant.

A girl who looked like Leander's fan dropped her suitcase in front of us and ran towards Leander, screaming.

I heard people around us start to talk.

""It's Leander!""

""Can you believe it's him? Where is he going? Will he be on the same flight as me?""

""He didn't bring anything. It looks like he's here to pick someone up. Oh my... I'd be jealous of the person he's receiving!""

""Could he be here to pick up his girlfriend?""

...

I started to feel nervous. This was my first time being so close to a celebrity in a public place, and he was also one of my stepbrothers. I lowered my head anxiously, hoping people wouldn't notice me.

But it was too late. Leander had already reached us. More and more people who recognized him were coming towards us. 

Some had already seen me and were wondering, ""Who's that girl?""

Leander also noticed me. He asked in surprise, ""Is it you? Did you follow me to my city?""

I couldn't help but glare at him. Wasn't it a bit too early for jokes now?

Seeing that I was a bit annoyed, he smiled and said, ""Just kidding! I believe you're Faye. What a coincidence!""

They both acted like walls, surrounding me, and we quickly left the area, heading for the parking lot.

We arrived at the parking lot, and Leander shook off the enthusiastic fans. He went straight to a luxury car that I couldn't name. The bright orange exterior of the car matched Leander's cheerful personality.

Liam helped me put my luggage in the trunk, and I sat on the back seat. Leander fastened his seatbelt and turned to me. ""From the moment I saw you, I felt a special connection. The moon goddess had already arranged everything and it was all foreshadowing. You're our sister.""

I couldn't help but laugh. ""I haven't had the chance to thank you for that day. Thank you, Leander."" It was the first time I said his name. 

Leander started the car. ""No problem. When we get home, you can praise me in front of Mom.""

Mentioning our mother, Elena, made me feel nervous. My palms began to sweat.

Our car started moving. I couldn't help but wonder about my mother and her family.

""She's a great mother,"" Liam said. He always spoke so seriously and concisely.

""Yes, Liam is right,"" Leander added. ""We lost our biological mother when we were young, and Elena raised us. She treats us all equally. Faye, don't be nervous. Elena is your mother, and she will love you too.""

Their words gradually eased my nervousness, and I started to look forward to meeting my mother.

But for some reason, my mind kept replaying the scene when I met Liam and Leander earlier. Those enthusiastic fans running through my mind, that long-lost sense of danger crept up on me again.

I am almost 18 now, and after I get my wolf, I will find my mate. I didn't want my mate to be a heartthrob. I didn't like having lots of girls around my man.

But I was always surrounded by people like that, just like Andrew.

Andrew was my first love, and like Sibyl, he was a friend I grew up with in the orphanage. We fell in love when we were 14, but he was taken away by his family shortly after. That was when I found out he was a werewolf with alpha bloodlines.

Afterward, we kept in touch. At first, we had a long-distance relationship, expressing our feelings for each other in our letters. But then, we write the lower frequency. I went to his city to find him and discovered he was surrounded by a lot of girls. His beta told me that Andrew's Luna might be among those girls.

I was furious and broke up with Andrew when I found him. When I met Leander, these familiar feelings made me worry about what my future mate would be like him.

I felt conflicted. I have arrived in the state of San Tan. What if my future mate wasn't here?

Of course, the most pressing issue now is how to get along with my mother and her family.

I subtly observed Liam and Leander, who were sitting in the front. They looked so alike, yet their styles were completely different. Honestly, I would prefer to chat with Leander. He was more approachable and humorous. His status as an athlete also made me secretly happy. I was going to be the stepsister of a celebrity. Everything seemed perfect, except that he was very popular among girls, which reminded me of unpleasant memories from the past.

As for Liam, he seemed like a block of ice, serious and stern. I was a bit worried that I might say something to upset him. Plus, I didn't even know what he did for a living.

As I was lost in my thoughts, Leander's car smoothly entered a small town. It looked like the perfect place I'd only seen in tourism brochures. No, it wasn't small at all. It was much larger than a small town. Clean roads were lined with neat houses, and a castle-like building stood in the distance.

Leander pointed at the building. ""That's our home.""

**Chapter 4 Mom**

Faye's POV 

Leander pointed at the building. ""That's our home.""

What? No way! That's where princesses live! I couldn't help but exclaim.

Leander chuckled and turned to me. ""Well, from today on, you're a princess.""

It was then that I realized I had let my inner thoughts slip out.

Liam joined in the laughter.

In an instant, my cheeks turned hot and flushed. It wasn't just my imagination. I always felt like Liam didn't quite like me. His laughter had a way of choking me.

Soon, our car arrived at the castle-like building. From a distance, I saw two people standing at the castle gate.

Before the car had come to a complete stop, someone rushed toward us, shouting my name. Oh my goodness, it was my mother, Elena!

""Hey, mom, this is too dangerous!"" Leander shouted as he brought the car to a stop.

We got out of the car, and everything around me left me feeling overwhelmed. Elena stood in front of me, tears glistening in her eyes as she took my hand.

""My daughter..."" she trembled.

My mind went blank, and my lips quivered. I couldn't find any words to say.

Elena's eyes held a whirlwind of emotions – excitement, worry, encouragement...

I heard Leander softly say, ""Faye might be too nervous, after all...""

A voice in my head screamed at me, ""Say it! Say it!""

Stamping my foot, I took a deep breath. ""Mom!""

FINALLY! 

I had managed to say it, using every ounce of strength, as if it were the first word I had ever uttered since birth.

Elena was equally excited. She embraced me tightly. Soon, I felt a wet spot on my shoulder. Elena was crying.

""Ladies, I know you're all excited right now. Today is a big day of celebration for our family, but should we consider going inside? We've been blocking the gate for too long, and our gardener might have some opinions about that,"" Louis suggested.

Elena lifted her head from my shoulder, her gaze shifting to the gardener in the distance who was holding a hose and chuckled. ""You're right. We can't stand here like fools forever.""

The man who spoke was a middle-aged man, his hand resting on Elena's shoulder. Clearly, he was Louis, the Alpha of the Silver Moon pack.

I wasn't sure how to address him.

Luckily, Louis was a friendly man. He spoke to me, saying, ""Just call me Louis, Faye.""

Then, he took Elena's hand. ""Ladies, let's go home! Liam, Leander, follow us!""

""Okay, I'm the driver and the luggage carrier,"" Leander joked behind me.

As we stepped inside, I realized this building was indeed a castle. There was a lovely girl waiting for me inside. She is my little sister, Layla.

As soon as we met, Layla gave me a big hug. She smelled like laundry detergent and a faint hint of sweat from her after-school activities. It wasn't unpleasant and it carried the fragrance of a teenage girl.

""I have just finished school. I'm sorry, sister, I couldn't join my brothers in welcoming you home.""

""It's okay!"" I blurted out, ""I can pick you up from school in the future!""

""Oh,"" my mother sighed with relief. She leaned into Louis's embrace, looking happily at me and Layla.

The warm welcome from my family helped alleviate many of my fears about the future.

Leander returned with my suitcase and then carried it upstairs. The second floor was the living area, and my room was next to the twin brothers', across from a study. At the other end of the hallway were Layla's room and Elena and Louis's bedroom.

My mother showed me my new room, and I was pleasantly surprised. It was the largest and most luxurious room I had ever stayed in. The view from the window was stunning. I could see the beach and palm trees. The sound of the waves on the shore, the soft evening light that bathed the room like an orange glow. It all felt perfect. I could already envision myself reading on the couch by the window. Oh, and the bed! It was big enough for three people to sleep comfortably. The Moon Goddess knew how cramped my dormitory bed at the orphanage had been!

My sister left the space for me and my mother, and we sat on the edge of the bed.

""Finally, I get to see you again, my dear daughter,"" my mother said, her voice trembling, ""what I once hoped for has now become a reality.""

My voice quivered too, ""Mom, I am...""

My mother held my hand, ""Tell me about your life all these years,"" she said gently.

I wasn't a great storyteller. I didn't know where to start, especially when the listener was my mother. I began by talking about life at the orphanage, painting a picture of tranquility and beauty. I had many friends, although most of them had left me behind. Still, a few had stuck by my side, like Sibyl.

""Please, share some details. Faye, I want to know more about you!"" my mother urged.

I scratched my head, not sure what to say. My mother noticed a scar on the side of my palm. ""What's that? When did you get this? Does it hurt?""

I extended my palm to show her, ""It doesn't hurt anymore."" It was from when I was sixteen and accidentally got burned by the steam from a coffee machine at Uncle Simon's café. It had healed a long time ago.

""Oh, my poor child!"" My mother traced the scar with her finger, ""If I had found you earlier, you wouldn't have been hurt like this...""

""It's okay, mom. I really enjoy making coffee! And I'm quite good at it. That time, I just lacked experience. I won't make that mistake again. Tomorrow, you can taste the coffee I make.""

""Your stepsons have already tasted the coffee made by me,"" I added mentally.

My mother was delighted, ""Oh, that would be wonderful!""

Knock, knock, knock.

Someone was at the door. Louis pushed open my room's half-closed door. ""Ladies, dinner is ready. Join us downstairs. Oh, and Faye, you might want to change into something more comfortable.""

""Oh, right,"" my mother reminded me, ""we've prepared a beach bonfire dinner to welcome you. Louis is right. Let's change something suitable for the beach. We'll be waiting downstairs for you.""

""Okay, I'll be there shortly,"" I said.

In the meantime, my brain was spinning quickly, considering which dress would be the most appropriate for a beach bonfire dinner. When I headed downstairs, my twin brothers, little sister, mother, and Louis were already dressed and ready.

Leander caught my eye with his outfit. He was wearing a floral shirt and linen shorts, with flip-flops on his feet, looking very relaxed and perfectly suited for the beach.

Liam, on the other hand, remained as impeccable as ever. Despite heading to a beach bonfire dinner, he was still in a linen suit, though it appeared to be less formal than usual.

Upon seeing me come down, Leander let out a whistle. ""Wow, I love that dress on you."" He stared at me unabashedly, sporting a broad grin.

""Thank you, Leander,"" I said. I loved this dress too. It was specially chosen for my Santan journey. It was a white strap dress with an open back, perfect for the sunshine, beach, and palm trees here.

Not surprisingly, Liam glanced at me briefly, frowned, and then coldly remarked, ""I don't like it. You have too much skin exposed.""

What? I couldn't help but protest, ""Come on! It's summer!""

I glanced at my mother, Layla, and Leander. They all looked equally puzzled. Leander was the first to react, though. ""Liam, you...""

""You'll know,"" Liam dropped this cryptic statement and ignored me, heading out.

""Wait! Know what?"" I was thoroughly annoyed now. He was making me feel extremely uncomfortable. Now I have reasons to believe that Liam genuinely didn't like me!

I stood there, unsettled, my hands clutching my dress, not sure what to do.

It was my first day in this new home, and one of my stepbrothers had made it clear he wasn't pleased with me. Could anything be worse?

""Sis, don't be angry. Let's go for dinner first. Mom and dad prepared it especially for you,"" Layla tried to mediate.

I pushed aside my recent unpleasant encounter, forcing myself to calm down. I liked my sister Layla, and I didn't want to hurt her. So, I let go of the frustration and followed Layla to the beach.",1,1746013193.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I always thought it was just bubble baths and face masks that people did to post on social media. But, about a month ago, I was feeling pretty burnt out—work was draining me, and I just wasn’t taking care of myself. One day, I randomly decided to start waking up 15 minutes earlier just to sit with a cup of coffee and not rush into my day. I didn’t think it would be much, but those 15 minutes somehow made everything feel less overwhelming. Then I started making small changes: a quick walk after lunch, reading for 10 minutes before bed, and even making a habit of journaling my thoughts.

It’s been a month now, and honestly, I feel so much better. I’m more patient with people, my stress levels are way lower, and I’m actually *enjoying* my days again. I can’t believe how something so small, like a few extra minutes for myself each day, made such a big difference.

This was the first match and I was backing away from this but my parents insisted so that I get the experience lol. I somehow agreed, and the girls father called me later and literally took my job interview. 

He asked me about the different tools I use at work,etc since he was also from an IT background. Before hanging up, he said he wants to meet me in the weekend but he prefers further communication about when and where through emails!!!! I was literally like what? He said he hates to use WhatsApp and prefers email. He also said if he likes me then he's gonna schedule a google meet with his daughter as the next round of interview 😭😂😂

At this point, i told my parents that this is all a joke and they insisted me again to go with it for experience xD

I ended up writing an email and he acknowledged.
The weekend came and its early morning and I get a call from this person waking me up to tell me that he prefers cleans shaved men lmao!!

You guessed it, my parents insisted me again to go for experience.

I met him in a park where we sat on the benches and this time it was a face to face job interview and nothing about marriage. Counselled me about choosing a different career path and tried to sell me one of his friends coaching institute courses.

It doesn't end here. We decided to have coffee and was about to leave but then goddamn sprinklers turned on and I was completely soaked 😭😂
Nevertheless, had a coffee and this time he comments about my appearance. He expected me to come to park with a military haircut, business formals, shiny shoes, and yes, clean shaved. 

I said khatam tata bye bye, all the best for your daughter and left. All in all what a fun first time experience with this arranged marriage process. I wonder what else is in store for me.

1kbe84w,https://www.reddit.com/r/OvenMasters/comments/1kbe84w/explore_the_cuisinart_cpt142bk_toaster_review_is/,Explore the Cuisinart CPT-142BK Toaster Review Is It Worth Your Kitchen Upgrade?,"The **Cuisinart CPT-142BKP1 4-Slice Compact Plastic Toaster, Black** has become a frequent companion in my kitchen over the past few weeks. As someone who thrives on morning toast paired with coffee, testing this toaster daily provided ample opportunity to evaluate its capabilities. It’s sleek, lightweight, and designed with practicality in mind, though I found a few quirks worth considering.

**An Aesthetic That Saves Space**

One feature that truly stands out is its compact design. Measuring just 10.7 x 10.8 x 7.2 inches, it fits effortlessly into my cramped countertop space. I've rotated the toaster sideways and forward, and it remains versatile enough to fit snugly into any layout. The matte black finish complements most kitchen decors without screaming for attention. Lightweight construction (just 1 pound) makes it easy to relocate, though, admittedly, the predominance of plastic doesn't give it the premium feel some might prefer in their kitchen appliances.  

[Check Cuisinart CPT-142BKP1 price on Amazon.](https://chpizza.com/p/b00d25p82u/)

**Customizable Toast Experience**

My favorite aspect here is the dual control with seven shade settings. I’m someone who prefers golden toast, whereas my partner loves hers almost dark brown. With this toaster, we could easily adjust each side independently—toast for me on one side and a bagel for her on the other. It was a revelation when I realized I could even toast thick sourdough slices without them catching on the slots' edges, thanks to the generous 1.5-inch wide slots. The settings, ranging from light to dark, provide plenty of options for anyone wanting perfect customization.

**Effortless Features for Various Needs**

Those complaining about a lack of functions in typical toasters might appreciate this unit. It offers Toast, Bagel, Defrost, Reheat, and a Cancel button for stopping mid-toast. Defrost worked well for frozen waffles, a lifesaver on rushed mornings. The reheat function could’ve been more efficient—it sometimes didn’t warm leftover toast as evenly as desired—but overall, it’s acceptable for regular use.  

The high-lift carriage deserves some applause. Whether it’s mini slices of bread or the stray English muffin, I didn’t have to awkwardly pry hot items out using utensils (a known kitchen hazard). It pops up just enough to make retrieving smaller-sized treats simple and safe.

**Cleans Up Easily**

I was pleasantly surprised by how thoughtful this product is in terms of cleanup. The removable crumb tray, located discreetly at the base, slides out without fuss. After a few days, crumbs inevitably find their way in, though a quick empty keeps things tidy. The cord wrap beneath the unit is helpful for minimizing clutter while not in use. I’ll admit, though, coiling the cord tightly required some effort initially—it’s not as seamless as I’d like.

**Positives**

- Sleek compact design, perfect for small spaces.  
- Dual shade controls ensure your toasting is highly customized.  
- High-lift carriage makes retrieving smaller items fuss-free.  

**Areas of Concern**

- Over-reliance on plastic construction may give it a less durable feel.  
- Reheating might leave uneven spots on bread.  
- Cord management requires slight effort during initial use.  

**Competitive Options**

Curiosity made me evaluate how this product performs compared to some competitors like the Breville BTA720XL. That model does feel sturdier with its stainless steel finish but comes with a considerably higher price tag. The Breville also features more advanced technology, including consistent reheating, which I noticed this Cuisinart model doesn’t excel at. On the other hand, the **Cuisinart CPT-142BKP1** is more budget-friendly and handles everyday basics like bagels and toast remarkably well. It’s largely targeted at casual users who prioritize simplicity and space-saving features over additional bells and whistles.

Another contender is the BLACK+DECKER TR3500SD, which offers a slightly lower cost and similar shading options, though it sacrifices the dual controls that are so practical for multi-toast households. While it’s another compact competitor, I appreciate how this Cuisinart unit balances versatile toasting functions with a thoughtful design.

**Affordable Quality**

It genuinely punches above its weight when considering the price point. Features like multiple toasting options and dual controls usually appear in pricier models, making this a solid deal for what it offers. Of course, there’s room for improvement, especially in the reheating department, but none of these drawbacks majorly impacted its overall experience. With this toaster, you’re paying for functionality over luxury, which feels like a fair trade-off given the performance.

1kbe7hb,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1kbe7hb/kf8_repetition_of_exact_issue_kitchenaid_support/,"KF8 repetition of exact issue, Kitchenaid support non existant","Hi,

Trying here as a last ditch effort, on my 2nd hour of being on hold with Kitchenaid for the 8th time I think. (Update just got disconnected 5 seconds after being put on with a person)

I purchased the KF8, makes great coffee, looks great, used it happily for 2 days; get this issue where no liquid comes out, open the side, turns out the filters completely clogged. Don't really understand why as it was rinsing all the time and 2 days worth of use in the small office that I'm using it probably makes for a max of 20 coffees or something?

Take out the filter and rinse it as per instructions. Now I can't insert the brewing unit again, seems like the sort of geared(?) rubber casket that connects the main unit and the brewing unit that activates the mechanism isn't aligned now, and there's seemingly no way of rotating these so they align and allow for reinsertion again, spent an hour or two trying to figure this out (you can release some of the mechanisms on the brewing unit, realized none of these really would help me) before I called up Kitchenaid support.

Probably a bit much to refer to it as support, it's really just order support because the people know absolutely nothing about the machines.

Anyways sent a video of my issue, am told to send the machine back to them. This took 2 seperate phone calls btw, with an hour wait time for each.

Get machine back.

Produce literally 1 cup of coffee on it and receive the same error, remove the brewing unit, doesn't seem to be any coffee stuck or anything, but now can't reinsert the unit again. Also machine came back from repair with a bent power plug, bent it back myself, whatever (clearly not getting tasted at factory).

Don't want to bore you with the issues of Kitchenaid support apart from communicating to anyone who might stumble on this that it is _non-existant_ and you can expect to wait for minimum an hour every time you want to talk to someone. Emails are _not_ responded to, ever. Also for extra fun after you've waited for more than an hour the line will just disconnect. Brilliant. Happened more than once.

Anyways I have several days of phoning Kitchenaid to tell them it took one cup to break the machine again, and they send me a new one.

Third time's a charm you might think, entirely new machine, surely first one's just a dud. Exact same issue after 2 days.

*Now I'm sorrry to have wasted your time but hopefully you got something out of reading this, some sick enjoyment.*

**What I actually wanted to ask was, does anyone have any experience with not being able to re-insert a brew unit on a KF8? I have no doubt on the crapness of Kitchenaid as a company after dealing with them, but this machine gets so much praise and I see some maintenance videos etc on Youtube after trying to google it, and if I've managed to put it in this state 2 times on completely different machines surely other people have managed it as well?**

1kbe66a,https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1kbe66a/expat_transitioning_mtf_in_uruguay/,Expat transitioning MTF in Uruguay,"Hello,

I was wondering if there is anyone here who can help me to tell me what it's like being a transwoman in Uruguay, especially Montevideo.

I know on paper, it's great. The laws etc. are all progressive. But are the people? Because I live in Portugal currently (I'm not Portuguese, but speak it fluently) and although the laws look super liberal and progressive, the reality is very very different. This is an extremely conservative country with 20% of the population being far-right and agreeing with the Trump-loving CHEGA party and hating on ""woke"" every chance they get. Then another 30-40% are centre-right and will probably swing further right at the drop of a hat, because they value ""traditional Christian family values"".

That leaves a small percentage of really liberal people, who are my friends circle. But even they, the allies, they are telling me that because I am a business owner, I cannot be openly trans because people will stop coming to my shop.

So, I have always been obsessed with all things Uruguay, even before I realized I was a woman and wanted to transition. I love Uruguayan cinema and literature, and I identify with that character. So, I am not the kind who is loud and flamboyant, just quietly flamboyant and confident. I am an extroverted introvert, and my idea of a good night is drinking one or two glasses of wine, lotsa coffee and mate, and discussing Bolaño, Onetti, Peri Rossi, poetry, and socialism. Everyone likes a good dance in a bit of a louder place every now and again, but I'm mostly the kind of person who keeps myself to myself until I trust people and can let my hair down with good friends.

So, are Uruguayans really genuinely tolerant and not just performative like many Portuguese? (please don't think I am hating on the Portuguese, I have many good friends here, but any Portuguese people reading this will know exactly what I mean). Also, I prefer Uruguay's informed consent system for HRT, rather than Portugal's required gender dysphoria diagnosis..

1kbe5jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kbe5jf/does_the_breville_bes840xl_infuser_espresso/,Does the Breville BES840XL Infuser Espresso Machine Deliver? Detailed Review,"The Breville BES840XL, also known as ""The Infuser,"" caught my attention as a standout semi-automatic espresso machine. As someone who starts their day with a fresh espresso or cappuccino, I'm no stranger to finding a device that combines practicality with quality. Over the past few weeks, I put this machine through its paces, brewing cups for myself, family, and the occasional visitor to test both its performance and usability. It's safe to say I’ve discovered its charm—but I also uncovered several quirks.

**Simple Yet Sophisticated Design**  
The design of this espresso machine walks a fine line between modern simplicity and high-quality craftsmanship. Its brushed stainless steel finish gives it a sleek, professional appearance, making it an attractive addition to any kitchen counter. At 22 pounds, it's not the lightest appliance, but the robust build assures you of its durability. Its compact design, measuring about 79x60x60 inches, fits neatly in smaller spaces. Despite its weight, it was easy for me to move it around while reorganizing the counter space.

**Performance That Supports Consistency**  
The Breville BES840XL stands out because of its ability to regulate water temperature precisely using PID technology. That’s jargon for ensuring that your espresso isn't burnt or under-extracted. From my testing, this feature was a game-changer. Every shot I brewed had a balanced flavor and impressive crema. The pre-infusion function gently wets the coffee grounds before extraction, ensuring optimal flavor release. For fellow coffee nerds who focus on consistency, this machine really delivers.

Check [Breville BES840XL] price on Amazon.

**User Experience for Coffee Enthusiasts and Novices Alike**  
This espresso machine offers a user interface that even my coffee-illiterate brother found manageable. With single or double-shot settings, you get full control over your coffee dose. Additionally, there's a manual override option if you're feeling more adventurous. One thing I appreciated while experimenting was the pressure gauge display. It helped me keep track of whether my espresso pull was optimal—a small but impactful detail often skipped by competitors. However, one drawback is that cleaning your machine after heavy use requires a bit of patience and commitment. Trust me, the drip tray fills up quicker than you'd think after making a couple of beverages.

**Merits**  
- Sleek, compact design fits in limited kitchen spaces.  
- Consistent temperature control with PID technology.  
- Pressure gauge assists in achieving a perfect espresso shot.  

**Disadvantages**  
- Cleaning can feel tedious for frequent users.  
- Water capacity might be limiting if making several cups.  

**Steamed Milk for Lattes and Cappuccinos**  
As someone who enjoys the occasional latte or cappuccino, the steam wand functionality didn't disappoint. The wand quickly reaches the ideal temperature for creating frothy milk. Whether it's thick latte foam or smooth microfoam for latte art, the versatility amazed me. Beginners, however, might find that the wand’s angle requires some adjustment to prevent splashing during steaming.

**Product Alternatives**  
When comparing ""The Infuser"" to products like the De'Longhi Dedica EC685 or the Gaggia Classic Pro, The Infuser holds its ground well in terms of brewing consistency and customization. However, the Dedica is more budget-friendly and compact, while the Gaggia Classic Pro might appeal to users focused solely on espresso quality. Both have their merits, but I found Breville’s dual functionality for espresso drinkers and milk-based coffee lovers to be unmatched. If you prioritize brewing versatility, Breville sits comfortably at the top.

**True Value**  
Given its precise brewing capabilities and sleek design, this semi-automatic espresso machine offers excellent value for enthusiasts who want café-style coffee right at home. While there are more affordable espresso machines, they might miss out on the extra features like PID control or precise pre-infusion settings. Compare those details closely before purchasing.

1kbe1dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuenosAires/comments/1kbe1dh/transitioning_mtf_in_buenos_aires/,Transitioning MTF in Buenos Aires,"Hello,

I made the same post for Uruguay, Montevideo, but I am also considering Buenos Aires.I was wondering if there is anyone here who can help me to tell me what it's like being a transwoman in Argentina, especially Buenos Aires.

I know on paper, it's great. The laws etc. are all progressive. But are the people? Because I live in Portugal currently (I'm not Portuguese, but speak it fluently) and although the laws look super liberal and progressive, the reality is very very different. This is an extremely conservative country with 20% of the population being far-right and agreeing with the Trump-loving CHEGA party and hating on ""woke"" every chance they get. Then another 30-40% are centre-right and will probably swing further right at the drop of a hat, because they value ""traditional Christian family values"".

That leaves a small percentage of really liberal people, who are my friends circle. But even they, the allies, they are telling me that because I am a business owner, I cannot be openly trans because people will stop coming to my shop.

I know there is a problem with Milei, but how much of that is felt in everyday life on a personal freedom level (I mean, I know there are economic problems that come with that)

So, I have always been obsessed with all things Uruguay and Argentine, even before I realized I was a woman and wanted to transition. I love Latin American cinema and literature, and I identify with that character. So, I am not the kind who is loud and flamboyant, just quietly flamboyant and confident. I am an extroverted introvert, and my idea of a good night is drinking one or two glasses of wine, lotsa coffee and mate, and discussing Bolaño, Borges, Onetti, Peri Rossi, poetry, and socialism. Everyone likes a good dance in a bit of a louder place every now and again, but I'm mostly the kind of person who keeps myself to myself until I trust people and can let my hair down with good friends.

So, are Argentinians really genuinely tolerant and not just performative like many Portuguese? (please don't think I am hating on the Portuguese, I have many good friends here, but any Portuguese people reading this will know exactly what I mean). Also, I prefer Argentina's informed consent system for HRT, rather than Portugal's required gender dysphoria diagnosis..

Oh god, I done wrote me an essay.

Oh P.S. I already have passable Spanish and am autistic with languages being one of my strong points, so Spanish would not be a problem.",2,1746012294.0,BuenosAires,5,0.75,False

A [lonely and depressed](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsPlayStories/comments/1kalbks/not_so_berry_straud_descendants_gen_10_ep_48_no/) Skye arrived at the Cantina El Árbol Del Jaguar bar for xir final assignment *I’ve completely wasted this great career opportunity and lost the perfect chance to start our family.*

As Xe turned to head inside, a familiar face stopped xem in xir tracks and sent xir heart soaring “Betty!?”

“Skye! Oh My Grim!” she ran over, wrapping xem in a bone crushing hug “I knew you were here somewhere; I was going to text you once I got settled, everything just happened so fast. Its great to see you!”

https://preview.redd.it/gtij2vsmhyxe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bec3844c63e061b2b6ac3706fcfb198f48bb2f2

Xir old friends' presence felt like a breath of fresh air to Skye’s soul. Xe could feel xir spirits lifting even as xe stood there, staring in disbelief.

Finally, xe grasped what notable recent event must have driven Betty to run so far from home. “I was so sorry to hear about Aunt Breanne” xe said “she was a wonderful sim; we’re all going to miss her.”

“Thanks” Betty’s smile fell away, tears springing to her eyes “it's been rough.” She looked around, squinting at the vibrant and sunlit courtyard. “Can we catch up inside? I could use some shade, and probably more than one juice.” Skye nodded, guiding xir grieving friend into the dimly lit bar.

“…we all knew her time was coming but that doesn’t make it any easier. Dad is devastated and Bruce… well he’s himself, all false swagger and cutting remarks, but between knocking up his girlfriend and this he’s really struggling. Did you hear he threw out his back at work? He and Lucy had just moved in with our parents to get some help while he got back on his feet, and then this happened.”

“Man, that sounds like a mess.” Skye nodded sympathetically. “So, what brought *you* all the way out *here*?”

*“*Seizing the day” Betty smiled “Mom always said, “you only live once”. I’ve always wanted to come here, explore the jungle; doing it now felt like a good way to honor her memory and get out of my own head for awhile.”

https://preview.redd.it/udw9podohyxe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2138bc53a954369521616ec02ea359bc787cb1f5

The pair had almost finished their first drink before it finally dawned on Skye to ask “Is Greyson with you? Wait… doesn’t he have a broken…”

“He got his cast off last week” Betty shrugged “He didn’t want to come, but him and his “weak ankles” will be fine by themselves for awhile.”

“You should have heard him when I suggested this trip!” she rolled her eyes before launching into an unflattering impression of their mutual friend “*I’m so busy, I can’t take that much time off! What if I reinjure myself running from grim knows what in one of those temples!? I could get us both killed!*” she sighed “He’s a good guy, and I love him, really I do, but he’s got no sense of adventure anymore and it's smothering me!”

“So, enough about me, tell me about you!” she motioned for the bartender to bus their empty glasses “I know you’re here for The Times, but I could only find a couple of your reviews on their website. Has Elyse been porting over to distract you? I know you two are totally inseparable.”

Skye frowned *I don’t want to burden her with my issues when she’s already been through so much, but she was so open with me… and I could really use someone to talk to.* “Honestly, no, and it’s really wrecking all my plans” xe finally began; quickly finding xemself unloading the entire sad story.

“… I’m not strong enough to do this by myself, and that’s why I’m leaving.” xe finished, hanging xir head and averting xir gaze.

 “Oh… Skye… I’m so sorry. I had no idea.” Betty reached over and gave xem a quick side hug “You know… it sounds like you’d really prefer to stay and finish this out. I’m not Elyse, but if you’re looking for some company, I could pitch my tent at your place. It’s not like the ruins are going anywhere.”

“I’d love that!” Skye quickly agreed “The house actually has a big loft upstairs. Its all yours if you want it. How long are you planning to stay?”

“Well, funny story, but I just found out an old friend of mine is planning to knock xemself up soon” she grinned “and Dad never shut up about how hard pregnancy was, even with Mom on hand. By the end of his pregnancy with me, he said he could barely get off the couch. “*You turned me into a watermelon on stilts girl*” she deadpanned, lowering her voice and flopping back dramatically in her seat in a playful mimicry of her old man.

“I quit my job at the coffee shop awhile ago.” she continued “I’ll be climbing the entertainer career someday, but for now busking with my violin pays the bills. Living with you, I can easily send Greyson enough simoleons to help cover our rent. This is going to be so much fun roomie!”

With a new plan courtesy of xir old friend Skye felt better than xe had in ages. “Let me jot down some notes about these drinks… you’ll have to tell me what you thought of yours later… and then you want to head out back and look at what they have for sale? I’ve been meaning to talk to the vendors about how the local wares are manufactured, and you can pick up some adventure gear.”

“Lead the way!” she replied with a  smile.

That evening Skye sat at xir laptop typing up a couple different articles for the paper while Betty told xem a funny story about her gig at that weeks Spice Festival “Apparently the event company got confused and thought the city wanted them to setup the Flea Market at the same time! They did their best, but man was it a mess…”

Suddenly Skye realized xe hadn’t felt sad for hours. Betty had only just arrived, but already she’d changed everything.

1kbdzhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_One-Student1976/comments/1kbdzhy/biscuit_delight_exploring_the_best_biscuits_for/,Biscuit Delight: Exploring the Best Biscuits for Every Craving,"When you think of a comforting snack, biscuits are often the first thing that comes to mind. Whether it's dipping them in your morning tea, enjoying them as an evening snack, or treating yourself to a sweet indulgence, biscuits are a universal favorite. But with so many options available, what really defines the best biscuits? From texture and flavor to the emotional connection they build with us, the perfect biscuit goes beyond just being a tasty treat. Let’s dive into what makes biscuits so irresistible and uncover the best biscuits for every taste bud.

 

**1. The Versatility of Biscuits -** One of the reasons [biscuits](https://www.parleproducts.com/) are so beloved is their versatility. They come in all shapes and sizes, from crunchy to soft, sweet to savory, and everything in between. A good biscuit is a reliable snack for all occasions. Whether you're looking for a quick energy boost during a busy day, or you want to enjoy a moment of relaxation with a warm cup of tea, there’s always a biscuit that fits the bill. The best biscuits offer that perfect balance of flavor and texture that works well with coffee, tea, or on their own. From everyday biscuits to special occasion treats, there's a biscuit for every moment.

 

**2. The Secret of Perfect Texture -** When it comes to the [best biscuits](https://www.parleproducts.com/), texture is everything. The perfect biscuit should have the ideal crunch - crispy enough to enjoy with a hot drink but not so hard that it breaks your teeth. While some prefer soft, melt-in-the-mouth options, others are drawn to those with a satisfying crunch. Biscuits like Parle-G and Marie biscuits have mastered this art, offering that perfect bite that makes them a favorite for people of all ages. It’s not just about the flavor; it’s about the experience of that first bite, the satisfying crunch, and the delicate crumb that makes biscuits a timeless snack.

 

**3. The Impact of Flavor -** There’s no denying that flavor is key to what makes the best biscuits stand out. A biscuit can be sweet, buttery, tangy, or even chocolate-filled. The possibilities are endless. The best brands have perfected their biscuit recipes over time, with rich, flavorful biscuits that satisfy both simple and sophisticated palates. For example, the combination of butter and vanilla in a biscuit can bring comfort, while a dash of chocolate or nuts adds a layer of indulgence. But for many, the flavor of a biscuit also holds nostalgic value, evoking memories of childhood or family traditions. A well-crafted biscuit not only satisfies hunger but also offers a taste of home.

 

**4. The Health Factor -** In today’s health-conscious world, many biscuit manufacturers are focusing on creating healthier options without compromising on taste. The demand for biscuits that are low in sugar, contain whole grains, or are fortified with vitamins has led to a rise in healthier variants.

For context, I’ve been with my wife 46F for 23 years. That’s 8,395 days. Not counting leap years. Not counting the three days we were technically “on a break” in 2004 when she said she needed space and I spent those nights lying on the kitchen floor staring at the ceiling fan wondering if love could kill a man. Spoiler alert, it didn’t. But it changed me. And now, I fear it may have evolved into something else entirely. I think I’m in love with her beyond the scope of human language. I don’t just love her. I revolve around her. I am a moon and she is my gravitational core. I don’t wake up unless she breathes. I don’t eat unless she’s eaten. One time she skipped breakfast and I felt off the whole day, like a cursed NPC wandering through a broken simulation. Her smile? No, not even a smile, MORE THAN THAT, it’s a beam of concentrated solar energy that hits me directly in the soul and recharges my will to live. She once smiled at me while eating toast and I dropped a glass. I said it slipped. It didn’t. My nervous system short-circuited from affection. You think I’m exaggerating? I WISH I WAS. Her scent? It’s not perfume. It’s not shampoo. It’s her. It’s indescribable. It smells like the first page of a new book, like rain hitting dry pavement, like everything good I’ve ever known compacted into a molecule. If scientists could bottle her scent, wars would end. Planets would align. Humanity would ascend. Sometimes I sit in the car for five minutes after she gets out just to breathe the air she left behind. That’s not normal, is it? And don’t get me started on her voice. Her voice sounds like velvet dipped in honey and rolled across piano keys. She once read aloud a cereal box and I had to excuse myself. Why? Because hearing her pronounce “riboflavin” felt erotic. I don’t even know what riboflavin is. I just know I’d die for it if she asked. She mispronounces “espresso” as “expresso” and I’ve never corrected her. Ever. I’d fight a linguist to protect her right to say it wrong. She once argued that the sun is “probably colder on the inside” and I said “maybe, who knows.” Because if she’s wrong, I don’t want to be right. If she told me the sky is green, I’d squint until it was. I’ve memorized the rhythm of her footsteps. The exact sound of her sigh when she can’t find her charger. The angle of her head tilt when she’s pretending to listen but is actually thinking about snacks. And God help me, when she ties her hair up in a lazy bun, I have to physically look away sometimes because the sheer casual beauty of it makes me lightheaded. Like. Oxygen-deprivation-level lightheaded. She doesn’t know I do this, but I collect the things she leaves around the house, bobby pins, hair ties, lone earrings, receipts with her handwriting. I have a drawer full of them. Not because I’m weird (okay, maybe a little), but because I need proof that someone like her actually exists in this mortal realm. That she’s real. That I didn’t hallucinate her into being. We met when we were in our mid-20s. I spilled coffee on her by accident. She said, “Well, I guess we’re married now,” and laughed. I laughed too. She doesn’t even remember saying that. I do. Every day. I hear it in my dreams. That’s how deep it runs. When we fight, RARELY, I wouldnt do anything to defy her, if i did made her upset, id cry and crawl for her, I get more upset about the fact that we’re fighting than the content of the fight. She once yelled at me for forgetting to take out the trash, and I just stood there marveling at how beautiful she looked while angry. Her eyeswere so beautiful. Her nostrils flared like a majestic warhorse. I almost even forgot to apologize. I was too busy being enchanted. I follow her around the house like a lost Roomba. If she moves rooms, I move. Not in a creepy way (I think), but because her presence is like WiFi. When I’m not near her, I feel disconnected. Empty, Like a meat shell powered down. She once tripped on a rug and muttered “We really need to get rid of this rug.” under her breath and I genuinely considered burning the rug. I imagined us throwing it into a fire together, laughing. Bonding over its betrayal. I had a whole revenge fantasy against a floor decoration. Every time she says “I love you,” I want to bottle it. Save it for the apocalypse. Inject it straight into my bloodstream like a magical serum that reverses entropy. I have no one to talk to about this. My friends say “you’re lucky,” but they don’t understand. This isn’t just luck. This is obsession. Devotion. Worship. I’m not in love. I’m haunted by her goodness. I’m possessed. She lives in my head rent-free, and I pay utilities. I’ve thought about writing a memoir titled “She Sneezed and I Believed in God Again.” Is there a name for this? A hotline? A support group for men who are too in love with their wives? Am I okay? Is she okay? Does she know she’s married to a man who’d willingly crawl through glass if it meant hearing her say “babe, you missed a spot”? Please. Tell me this is love and not some kind of spiritual aneurysm. I’m begging. This sounds straight out of a novel, but trust me, I would've hoped.",12,1746011832.0,AmIOverreacting,47,0.73,False

If you haven’t caught up with Honky Tonk in a while or want to read the other series, that’s the place to start!

\------

**Intro:** Our boy Halin has been working hard at the Honky Tonk, and unfortunately that has led to a bit of a separation between himself and his parents despite living in the same house. Luckily, the times have aligned, and Halin now has a day off from work that lines up with dear old Dad Harvid. A bit of Father and Son time ahead.

**Memory Transcription Subject: Halin. Venlil Manager at Little Branson. On Paid Time Off.**

**Date: \[Standardized Human time\] January 25, 2138**

I follow closely behind and watch as her tail sways back and forth while she walks down the garden path to the hovercar. The door opens to a rarely full vehicle packed with our coworkers for the band and a few for the restaurant. I hold the door open and give her tail a quick twist with my own as she enters the cabin and finds a seat. Stepping back in front of the open door, I offer a meek tail and paw wave towards the car’s occupants, and they quickly return the gesture. Her beautiful blue eyes seem to glitter as she gives me a quick farewell.

“Thanks for helping me in Halin! Good luck at your appointment this paw! See you after work!”

“Thank you, Tiltva; I’ll be sure to message you how it goes. Enjoy work, everyone!”

**“Bye, Halin! Good luck!”**

*~~Bye Tiltva, love you.~~*

*Shut up. Shut the brahk up, brain.*

*Why? Why shut up? Ray has been saying that she likes you too. How wrong can he be?*

*Oh yeah, the guy with a million cameras has no proof of her ever mentioning anything like that.*

*Okay, but have you considered that she* ***licked you*** *during the party? Or what about scratching your head? What else could-*

“Halin, son, are you going to come back in?”

I look around me to find that the hovercar is long gone, and yet I am still standing alone in the garden. I turn back to the front door to see Dad leaning against the door frame with his tail swishing around in worry behind him. With a shallow sigh, I will my ~~sore~~ feet to move back towards the house and my parents.

“Yeah, for sure. I was on my way in, Dad; it’s fine. Just a bit.... *Distracted.”*

“Sure, distracted, if that’s what you’re calling it. Anyway, your mom has first meal ready, and she’ll be pretty upset if you let it go cold, let alone not share it with her. So get in here.”

The thought of fresh-fried and sugar-coated melroot flows through my mind, and as I reenter the house, I can smell the sweet caramelized sugar on my tongue. I step past Dad and he gives me a hard tail thwack on my back as we walk side-by-side back towards the dining room. Sitting down at the carved heartwood table, I take the teapot and pour all three of us cups of Colian Bitting tea, and not even giving it a moment to cool, I take a deep sip of the fragrant, oily drink.

*It’s fine, it really is, but compared to coffee? Not a dark-sider's chance on the burning wastes.*

In just a moment, Mom walks in from the kitchen with a full platter of her cooked melroot and sits it down between Dad and I then comes around the table to sit next to me. As soon as she plops down in her chair, I quickly flick my ears in thanks and grab the tongs to serve myself a portion of the dish. Soon Mom and Dad follow, and we are quietly munching through our starchy ~~breakfast~~ first meal. I notice a bit of movement to my side and then I suddenly feel a weight on my shoulder. I focus an eye over to see Mom leaning against me as she chews away.

“Mom? What’s going on?”

“Am I not allowed to cuddle with my pup? I feel like I never get to see you anymore with that human work schedule Ray makes you follow!”

*I guess I don’t mind it that much. A bit hard to lean against though so I don’t topple and 'pup' is for sure a stretch at this point.*

“Your Mom is right, Halin; humans may have the endurance for that, but it’s not natural for Venlil to be worked that way. Don’t give me that look. I’m not saying that for any other reason besides you’re my son, and I *know* these things because of my position at the hospital.”

*Again with the hospital administrator flexing. Doesn’t mean you’re right about everything.*

“Dad, Mom, it’s fine! It really is! Ray doesn’t have a choice in the schedule because of his other two jobs and travel schedule. And besides, the coffee he makes for me really makes it as easy a walk through the garden—nothing at all, *really.*”

“Halin, pup, but what about your leg? Spending all that time there walking around isn’t right either. Don’t think that because the doctor’s follow-up approved you to walk without the boot that your dad and I haven’t noticed the way you still favor your uninjured leg.”

“That’s fine too! It’s just… getting used to it again, that’s all.”

“What do you even do there that needs that much walking? I thought he just had you working management-type things?”

*~~And sometimes helping with the meat vats.~~*

“Well, it’s that in the office, but also occasionally things like the inventory at the restaurant or surveying the grounds for future development. Also, sometimes Tiltva and I will spend time with Thyla to keep her entertained on her homeschool paws.”

“Restaurant, that restaurant. And you say that there’s no meat served there?”

*Yeah, no, not talking about that.*

“And besides Thyla being a fun little menace, I… I-I sometimes take the time to go and listen to Tiltva as she practices her songs.”

“Oh, Tiltva, huh? This job sure has been a great opportunity to spend more time with her. What’s that you mentioned about you guys having the company car to yourselves sometimes on your way home and back?”

*Nope. No way. Not having this convo either right now.*

“Oh, would you look at the claw! Cab should be here; time to go! Come on, Dad, don’t want to be late. Love you Mom!”

“Oh, is that how it’s going to be, Halin? You can’t hide from your Mom forever. Be safe, good luck, love you!”

With that, I quickly get up from the table and ~~hobble~~ walk back towards the front door while frantically signaling to Dad to hurry up and follow. With a groan, he gets up, grabs his pack, and joins me in walking out of the house. At the end of the path, an obnoxiously painted Mirror Lake Cab Company car is parked and waiting, but surprisingly, this time there is no driver. Dad takes a moment to pause and tilt his ears before realizing what’s going on.

“Oh, Halin! Is that a driverless cab?”

“Sure looks like it, unless of course the driver bailed and tucked tail at the sight of us two coming out.”

He laughs with a whistle and again slaps the back of my shoulder.

“Because we’re some real predators, the two of us, huh?”

Getting to the cab, I flash my pad across the door and open it to the one-size-fits-none seats typical of big city cabs. I take a reluctant spot on the hard but clean vinyl seat and watch as Dad, again grumbling, gets in and sits down. With the door closed, the electric motors whir to life, and we start down the subdivision roads towards the hospital. I notice as Dad’s eyes go from out the window to me to the window and then back again. I flick an ‘Okay?’ with an ear, and he then fully turns back towards me.

“Don’t think I don’t know you’re trying to avoid talking about that job of yours and Tiltva.”

“Y-yeah, listen… I…”

“Nope, if you don’t want to talk about it yet, don’t. I’ll worry over you because you’re my son, but you’re also a grown man. Take your time.”

“Thanks, Dad.”

\------

After only a quarter claw or so of travel, the cab finally pulls itself into the outpatient center at Mirror Lake Grand Central Medical. The doors unlock, and as I step out and look back for Dad following behind me, I instead see a rather nervous man has replaced him in the backseat of the car.

*Is he scared? What is he scared of? I don’t even see any humans nearby.*

“Dad? You good?”

“It just hit me that I’m back at work on my off paw. Stars above, I hope no one ties me down to my desk chair when I try and get in and out of my office.”

“You don’t have to come inside if you don’t want to. Just take a walk to the park and I’ll call when I’m done.”

“No, it’s okay. I want to be here for you. Also, I ***do*** need my water bottle, which I forgot in my mini-fridge.”

He steps out, and together we ~~limp~~ walk inside the center, and at Dr. Dausa’s office I stop at the lobby door and give Dad a bop on the back as he takes off down the hall to his office in the main medical center. After a quick, nervous gasp of air, I open the door to a surprisingly busy waiting room. I quickly make my way to the desk and make sure to stand tall as the receptionist brings their attention to me.

“Good paw, sir, here for an appointment with Dr. Dausa?”

“Yes, ma’am.”

“Perfect, just tap your pad and fill out any and all relevant information in the form, and Dr. Dausa will see you shortly.”

With an ear flick for confirmation, I pull up the documents on my pad and make my way over to an empty chair in the corner of the room. Though it only takes me a moment to fill out all of my information and new insurance policy from Ray, a steady stream of other patients comes in and out of the office, as presumably we are all here for the same thing.

*I knew uncure and genetic fixes were getting more popular, but this place is getting almost a bit too crowded even for herd standards.*

With only a little bit more tedious form filling, I send the file back to the receptionist, and nearly instantly a pink Iftali nurse opens the door and calls my name. Waving my tail to get his attention, I join up with him as we walk down the hall of examination and procedure rooms.

“Good paw, Mr. Halin, how are you feeling?”

“Perfectly well, thank you!” 

“Just to confirm, you are seeing Dr. Dausa for a Skalagan gene fix?”

“That’s correct.”

“Wonderful, just enter this room and take a seat on that examination chair. The doctor will see you shortly.”

As the nurse closes the door behind me, I take a quick moment to survey the small room. A sterile paper covers the chair and there's a small desk with a set of cabinets with a sink fills out the other corner of the room. Beside the chair, a classic QuickView imaging arm is stowed. neatly away. I settle myself ionto the crinkly paper of the chair and spend only a moment before a knock sounds on the door.

*Okay, I’m ready. Let’s do this.*

“Come in!”

The door clicks and slides open to reveal a rather gray Zurulian woman excitedly hurrying into the room with a small cart. She greets me with her tail, and I readily flick my ears back in ‘Hello’. Despite that, she decides to greet me again anyway.

“Hello, Mr. Halin! Here to feel more Skalgan?”

“Well, not myself feeling Skalgan, but if I have any pups, I think they’d appreciate the upgrade.”

“Oh, of course, of course! I can say with confidence that all of the new Skalgan Venlil pups I’ve been seeing here at the hospital are already much healthier! They sleep and eat with ease. Almost as easily as a Letian joey! Very nice on new parents. Now just hold still for a moment, please.”

She then pulls the cart alongside me, steps onto a stool to get to nearly my height, and then in a quick motion she takes a needle off the cart and jabs my arm. With her motions so fast, I barely have time to register it all as it happens. Stepping off the stool, she goes to my knees and begins quickly feeling up and down the joints and muscles

*Oh man, when is the second shot coming?* Oh Stars, I don’t know if I’m ready…

“Mr. Halin, you only wanted a gene reversal, correct?”

“Uhh, yes. Why?”

“Good, because if you wanted the knee correction, you’d be out of luck.”

*Uhhhhh. Whar?*

“W-what do you mean?”

She takes another look at the accident damage on my leg and pokes hard at it as pain shoots up and down the nerves.

“This is recent trauma, yes?”

“Yeah, a city crane fell on me a few herds of paws ago now. Rushed to surgery here at the hospital and then had a while of recovery with a mobility boot.”

“So then why don’t you have your mobility boot on?”

“I was told by Dr. Luakim that it was ready to come off and start walking normally.”

“Dr. Luakim is nearly a Sivkit in his medical knowledge! You should have it on still! Stars, you should’ve been wheelchair-bound for recovery. Here, let me show you what I am feeling.”

Dr. Dausa then takes the QuickView, positions it over my bad knee, and then shows me the feed on her pad. As she points to various points in the image.

“See, right here is scar tissue and bone damage from improper healing procedures and overstress. Now, normally this would be caught long before it was able to deteriorate to this condition, but it’s nearly too far gone now. We could get you in for an operation to attempt correction, but I can’t say with certainty that it’d leave you off better than you are now.”

*Too far gone? This is permanent?*

“**Brahk me!”** 

Dr. Dausa startles and takes a quick few steps back before recovering and coming back to my side.

“Sorry, sorry for yelling like that.”

“Don’t be sorry, dear; you have every right to be upset. What I recommend going forward is to reequip your mobility boot for permanent usage.”

*Noooo, not the boot…*

“That… that kind of sucks, ma’am. My boot is loud and annoying to use.”

“Then just get a better model? Have you looked at your insurance coverage? It’s pretty damn good; it could get you one of the advanced slim Earth models. One thin enough to cover with false fur or a boot or whatever color you want.”

“And how long do I have to wear it again?”

“Forever, unless I’m incorrect in that you’re having trouble getting around.”

*Forever?* ***Forever?!*** *Brahk, brahk me… I’m a double-crippled Venlil…*

*You still have your leg! Be grateful!* 

*Quiet me; I’m allowed to complain a little bit, right?*

*We’ll see how much complaining you do when the real gene treatment starts.*

“Thank you, doctor, for your help. Now when do we do the gene reversal?”

“Mr. Halin, what do you think the shot was for? Were you expecting something else?”

I feel my face bloom bright orange as my tail wags in relief for my bits not having to be stabbed.

“Oh, that’s right, thank you again.”

“Of course, now you have a good rest of your paw and make sure to eat plenty this paw and the next. The edits need a lot of energy to get you fixed up and ready for any future Venlil pups!”

I sign a quick and embarrassed goodbye and exit the examination room, back through the hall, out the waiting room, and to the hallway to see Dad waiting for me while staring at a mixed-variety drink vending machine. 

“Hey, Dad, thinking of getting a walking beer on our way to find something to eat?”

“Yeah, but I don’t want anything heavy. How does a 10% Ittel Sweet sound?”

“Sounds great, actually! Grab me one as well. Apparently I need the calories.”

He makes a quick tap of his pad on the machine, and we watch and wait as the little platform grabs the cans one at a time. As we walk down the hall and back to the outside street, I enjoy the familiar crack and hiss of the cans as we enter the near-permanent sunshine and lake-chilled air. With a vague idea of where I want to eat for second meal, I shoulder bump Dad and start our way down the city streets. I notice as Dad takes his recovered water bottle out and pours his beer inside, making sure to toss the can into the next trashcan we pass.

“So, how’d it go?”

“Ehh, not exactly great.”

“What? What do you mean?”

“The gene edit went fine and was actually just in the form of a quick shot, but Dr. Dausa said my leg didn’t heal right and I should probably be in a mobility boot for life.”

Dad’s ears and tail make a rare break in emotion and jolt in worry before he takes a paw and rubs the worry off his face.

“Brahk, I’m sorry to hear that, Halin. I know I should’ve had you assigned to a better surgeon. Wool-brained waste...”

“On the sun side, Dr. Dausa said that my new insurance covers a high-end, Earth-made boot that’ll fix all of the problems I hate about my old one. Oh, speaking of sun side, Ray showed me this song a few days ago. Take a listen.”

“A few ***days*** ago? Halin…”

“Paws, sorry, here, [just listen](https://youtu.be/8joVnqleS9Q)”.

Myself trying to ignore the results of my appointment, I hit play on the song on my pad and let it play quietly as we walk down the streets. Hopefully quietly enough not to disturb everyone else as we walk by. Luckily for my leg, we don’t walk for too long before we find one of the staples of my childhood when I’d come to see Mom and Dad after school while they were still at work. The Gem Place Diner.

*Ah, it looks just as comfy as ever. Just standard Venlil fare like Dad likes.*

We step inside and are quickly guided to an available table by a blue ‘vacant’ light above a far booth. Sitting across from each other, we each grab an ordering pad off the table shelf and flick through the options available. After a bit of searching, I decide on a simple bunt leaf salad with fire fruit dressing and hit order as Dad makes his choice at about the same time. For the first time in a long while, we just kind of stare at each other, myself with a smile on my ears, and at first Dad has one too, but I can see a crack behind his eyes.

“Dad, are you okay?”

The facade drops for a second as worry floods his eyes but is quickly pushed down by now obviously false confidence and positivity.

“I’m fine. It’s fine.”

*Now* ***that’s*** *unusual.*

“That doesn’t sound very ‘fine’.”

His eyes uncomfortably flick around for a second before landing back on me, and his ears and shoulders slump as he puts his elbows on the table and leans into his paws.

“Halin, I’ve already told you once this paw that you can talk to me about things when you want, but if you can, would you humor an old man to vent for a moment?”

*I-I don’t know if I’ve ever seen him like this.*

“Of course, Dad, you can always talk to me.”

He takes a deep sigh and looks straight into and then through me.

“It’s been many cycles since you and Tiltva met, and when you first did, Etlena had already passed at that point and Tiltek was raising Tiltva alone. Now, don't get me wrong, Halin, I enjoy my coworkers at the hospital, and of course I love you and your mother more than anything else in this universe, but Tiltek… was my only just *regular friend*. Someone outside of my life as a father, as a husband, and unrelated to my career at the hospital. Someone that could share just a moment to allow each other to vent...

When Tiltek died in the raid last cycle, Tiltva lost her last blood family member, and we had to be there to support her, but I’m not sure if I have ever taken the time for myself to mourn as I don’t want to intrude on Tiltva’s grief. You have Tiltva and that human boss to keep you entertained and even some of your old university friends, but I’m not really sure if I have any friends outside the house anymore. I guess it’s a consequence of getting old, but I still feel… lonely, almost?”

*I wasn’t there for Tiltva properly, and only now I realize I wasn’t there for Dad either. Of course he’d miss his best friend…*

“Dad…”

“I know, I know, it’s a bit selfish to grieve Tiltek as a friend when Tiltva lost a father but-”

“No, Dad, I didn’t know you were feeling that way. Why-why don’t you try and find a new group? Someone new to hang out with?”

His ears suddenly fold back as he scoffs.

“Like who? Humans like yourself and your mother? Y-you know I still have trouble…”

*You really are going to need to get over that at some point.*

“It doesn’t have to be humans. There are still plenty of people here on Skalga, and we live in one of the nicer cities on the planet. I’m sure you can find something. If you want, I can sit down with you sometime and search for groups on MyHerd or Bleat?”

“I’d appreciate that, Halin. Thank you.”

At that moment, the waiter robot wheels up to the table, to which Dad and I readily grab our plates off of its tray and begin digging in. As I chew through my salad, another idea comes to mind, and I quickly open my pad to find the listing.

*Dad is going to flip speh when he sees this place, but after that lake paw with Ray, I think* *~~we~~* *I really do want something like it.*

I quickly find the property and reach my tail across the table to tap Dad on the shoulder as he brings his own tail to swack mine away.

“Halin, get a hold of yourself! I thought I taught you better than to reach your tail across the table! What do you need, son?”

I turn the pad to him, and his eyes haze over in confusion, with his ears falling flat before realization sets in and his ears rocket back up with a fury in his eyes.

“Halin! You ***cannot*** seriously be considering buying a lakefront foreclosure. This needs at least its worth in renovations *and,* ***and*** it’s nearly right on top of the water!”

“Dad, please. Even if you double the cost in renovations, it’d still be cheaper than a house in Foggy Cove. Not only that, it’s still pretty close to you guys and a bit closer to work for our commute.”

*Ohhhh, nice slipup there, me. Surely Dad won’t notice.*

“‘***Our’*** commute? Halin, son, I think there’s another thing you’re forgetting before you can say ‘***our’*** in context with buying a house. For example, maybe a few special words in a certain order combined with a little something that so happens to be sewn of your wool and a certain someone’s cream-colored wool.”

*You said you wouldn’t force the issue on me!*

“Anyway, **anyway,** the lakefront is actually part of why I want it. Ray showed me that despite living my whole life here, I never had a clue that the lake was so peaceful and enjoyable to be in and around. I think you’d like it as well. I mean, Stars, we now know we only don’t like lakes because of the Federation Archives.”

“Halin that’s fine and all for yourself, but… I-I just don’t know if I can do things like that…”

“You’ll get used to it. Oh! Maybe Ray can have you join all of us at the cove to sit in the hot springs runoff to start out?”

“Maybe, maybe…”

Taking advantage of the silence to finish our meal. I activate another cab request on the app, and we soon stand up out of the booth and exit to the awaiting car in the street in front of the diner. Again we get a driverless model, and I open the door with my pad, but this time I let Dad get in first. As we settle in with the cab taking us back home, I am suddenly strongly gripped around my shoulder, and my face is buried into thick, warm wool.

“Dad?”

“I love you, Halin. Thank you for putting up with me despite my reluctance to this new world.”

I quickly wrap my own arms around Dad and squeeze back as hard as I can.

“Love you too, Dad. I love you too…”

1kbdupr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/1kbdupr/cmsgt_promotion_ceremony/,CMSgt Promotion Ceremony,"Hey team,

Organizing a promotion ceremony for a new CMSgt, but unfortunately lacking traditional base support structures and there's no other E-9s in the country as we're at a GSU. 

My rough plan is below but was hoping to run it by a few folks here for QC. He'll have some family in town to pin him on and we'll have a small reception afterwards but otherwise he wants to keep it low key with no Chief's Creed (since we don't have another Chief to administer it anyways), no anthem, and no Air Force song. He did request to renew his oath of enlistment in place of the creed. 

Outlined plan is below; we'll be in service uniform and have some audience with the standard ceremony configuration. 

MC: Army O-6 (Colonel)
Officiating Officer: Air Force O-6 (Colonel) 

MC: Welcoming Remarks, Brief history of Chief position. 
Officiating Officer (also his supervisor): Say kind words about our new CMSgt and how awesome he is.
MC: Publishes promotion orders with promotee and officiating officer front and center. 
Promotee: Shake, Salute
Family: Pins on promotee with blues service dress, claps all around
Officiating Officer: Oath of Enlistment 
MC: Welcomes new CMSgt to podium for speech
 
Speech concludes, everyone welcome to reception / coffee / snacks.  

Am I missing anything?

'Flu outbreaks have been frequent lately. Everyone is urged to take precautions—limit visits to crowded areas, skip unnecessary gatherings, and dress warmly…'   
  
""Theresa! Are you even paying attention?"" Snapped out of her trance, Theresa flinched, her gaze darting around in disbelief at the scene before her as though it were something out of a dream. She was in a cramped living room, around 323 square feet with outdated decor. The space was filled with middle-aged men and women perched on an old couch.   
  
At the center of it all sat an elderly woman in her sixties or seventies, her gray hair disheveled and her round face heavy with years. She was glaring daggers at Theresa, and her plump, sagging cheeks trembled with visible irritation.  
  
Theresa froze as she took in the chaotic scene unfolding before her eyes. *Wasn't this the exact moment, two weeks before the apocalypse, when my so-called ""loving grandmother,""* *""caring father,"" and ""devoted stepmother"" had cornered me, trying to strong-arm me into giving up my home? Yet I had just been battling a sea of zombies at the Eastern Camp. How could I be back here again?*  
  
""Theresa! Ever since your mother passed, your stepmother has treated you like her own flesh and blood. Everyone praises her kindness! And now your brother's getting married and needs your house—what's the big deal? Stop being so miserly! You're nothing but an ungrateful, thankless brat!"" the elderly woman spat.   
  
""Mom, Theresa isn't ungrateful,"" chimed in the overweight woman beside her, putting on an exaggerated show of diplomacy. ""She'll understand and appreciate everything we've done for her.""  
  
The elderly woman let out a sharp, dismissive snort. ""Enough! Clear out of the house already! Your brother says it's been rented out too long, and the furniture is falling apart. How can he get married in a place like that? You'll cover the new furniture costs too—he's your elder brother, after all! Isn't it your duty as his sister to help with the wedding?""   
  
Standing amidst the crowd, Theresa suddenly burst into laughter, her voice sharp and bitter. *They wanted my house—and on top of that, they expected me to pay for brand-new furniture?* The sheer absurdity of it all was almost too much to believe. What was even more laughable, though, was the memory that flashed through her mind—because, in her previous life, she had actually gone along with this insanity!  
  
Back then, her mother had passed away in a car accident when she was just fourteen. Not long after, her father remarried, bringing a stepson into the family. Her stepmother, Lila Warren, had perfected the art of putting on a show, treating her with a facade of care and attention that seemed almost flawless. At that time, Theresa had been in the throes of teenage rebellion, lashing out at everyone like a cornered animal. Yet, beneath that prickly exterior, she had craved the comfort and connection of family, even if she refused to admit it.  
  
Lila had played her role brilliantly. Her gentle demeanor and feigned understanding had completely disarmed Theresa. She had pretended to support Theresa unconditionally, never scolding her for her behavior, and it worked—Theresa fell for the act. For a while, she genuinely believed Lila cared for her, and she even saw her as a maternal figure. She gave them everything they wanted without question, thinking it was her way of earning love. Even the house her late mother had left her—the only thing tying her to the past—was handed over with barely a second thought.  
  
However, when the apocalypse struck, their true colors were laid bare. Time and again, they cast her aside without hesitation. And when the opportunity to board the rescue vehicle came, they didn't hesitate to shove her out of the way, using her as a stepping stone for their own survival. That was when Theresa finally grasped the meaning of false affection. *So, this was what they called family?* From the very beginning, she had only been a tool for them to use—a piece of meat on their table, a source of sustenance to be drained dry. The moment she ceased to be useful, they discarded her without a second thought.  
  
*None of them had ever seen me as family. Not in any meaningful way!* She burned with regret, the urge to reach back through time and slap the naive, foolish version of herself from that time—her trust and love wasted on people who never cared! With a loud crash, she swept several bags of cheap fruit from the old coffee table into the trash can and planted herself firmly in front of them.   
  
""What the hell are you doing, Theresa? Those apples were imported, specially picked out by my mom because she knows you love them. How could you throw them away like that?"" The young man, who had been absorbed in his phone on the small couch, immediately put it down and shot her an angry look.  
  
She sneered. *I love apples?* It was news to her. Without a hint of warmth, she fixed her gaze on her so-called brother. ""And you think you have any right to talk to me about the house?"" Her eyes, cold and filled with venom, locked onto his, and for some reason, Oliver felt a shiver run down his spine. He couldn't bring himself to meet her gaze. Those eyes weren't just cold—they were the eyes of someone who had fought tooth and nail for survival in the apocalypse, who had been betrayed and left to fight for survival for ten long years. They were eyes that carried the weight of a killer's resolve!   
  
Oliver immediately shrank back, his bravado crumbling.  
  
At that moment, Lila, her stepmother, quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""Theresa, what's going on with you? Are you feeling unwell? We can visit another time. I know you're upset, but remember, Oliver is your brother, not some stranger! His wife's family is asking for a house in the city center, and nowadays, even with money, it's nearly impossible to buy one there—you have to draw lots!"" With a dramatic sigh, she added, ""I'm asking you as a mother. Please help your only brother. When you get married, we'll find a way to get you a house too! We'll take care of it for you...""  
  
""Take care of it?!"" Before Theresa could respond, her father, who had been silent up until now, spoke up with a thunderous voice. His glare was filled with anger. ""Do you honestly believe this house is yours? What use does a young girl have for a house like this? It's meant for your brother! When you marry, your husband will be the one to buy you a place. Why are you even arguing with your brother about it?""   
  
Upon hearing his words, Theresa felt no more anger, only a cold sense of indifference. In her past life, she had wondered why her father treated her so coldly while showering his stepson with affection. Now, the answer was painfully clear—Oliver was his biological son, his true heir! Prior to marrying her mother, he had been wed to Lila back in his hometown, where they had a son together. To him, she was nothing but an inconvenience. And after the apocalypse, his true nature only became even more repulsive!   
  
Theresa lifted two fingers with a chilling expression. ""Two million.""   
  
The room fell silent with everyone caught off guard and confused. ""Theresa, what are you talking about?""   
  
She coldly responded, ""This house was my mother's property before marriage, and it was legally transferred to me afterward. The deed is in my name. If you want it, you'll have to pay. I'm even offering a discount—two million.""   
  
They were shocked. ""You're selling the house to us? Are you serious? We don't have that kind of money!""   
  
Without missing a beat, she raised her wrist, showing her digital watch. ""You have five seconds to decide. If you refuse, I'll find another buyer. Five.""  
  
""Theresa, we're your elders! How can you talk about money with us?"" her grandmother snapped, furious.   
  
""Four,"" came Theresa's unyielding voice.   
  
""You ungrateful brat! I'll give you a beating!"" Theresa looked cold at the elderly woman, then continued her countdown. ""Three, two…""   
  
Her father jumped up, his fury boiling over as he attempted to strike her. ""How dare you!"" With a swift motion, she delivered a swift kick, sending his chair flying and watching as he tumbled to the floor in a heap.   
  
Her gaze remained icy as she uttered a single word, ""One.""  
  
""Theresa, you've lost your mind! How dare you lay a hand on your father!"" Unmoved by their outrage, she reached into her pocket, pulled out her phone, and dialed without a second thought, ignoring the chaos. ""Mr. Angus, I'm putting the house up for sale. Two million."" The property had been under the management of an agency for renting until she turned eighteen, at which point she could finally take possession of the keys. That was the only reason the house had remained in her name all this time. ""You want to take it off my hands?"" She flashed a sly smile as she glanced in her family's direction. ""Alright, then I'll...""  
  
""Enough, we agree!"" Lila, seeing the situation slipping through her fingers, rushed to say. ""Theresa, just sell it to us!"" *This is no joke! The house was valued at three million in the market! Getting it for just two million? That is a steal!* With all the limitations on new homes in the city—needing proof of residency and drawing lots—this property was a hot commodity! Even though things weren't unfolding exactly as they had hoped, the key was ensuring no one else snatched up the deal! *At that price, we could easily flip it and pocket a tidy profit! We have to make the deal now!*   
  
Theresa's lips curled slightly as she watched Lila's panicked agreement. With a casual flick of her finger, she ended the call.   
  
*Perfect. I'd let them have it.* Sure, two million wasn't the ideal price—she'd take a bit of a hit—but selling quickly mattered more than squeezing out every penny. Time was a luxury she couldn't afford to waste, and right now, she needed both time and cash. The real advantage, however, was what came next—once they bought the house, they'd be flat broke. The deal would leave them completely drained. She had calculated everything. Their entire fortune amounted to two million, nothing more. And with the apocalypse drawing nearer—and the government issuing warnings to stockpile supplies during the final three days before it hit—she wondered how they could possibly prepare for the storm when their pockets were empty. *Let them figure that out.* She'd already made her move.  
  
…  
  
*Beep*! 'Your account has been credited with two million.'   
  
Thirty minutes later, Theresa stood at the bank counter, watching as her account balance reflected the freshly deposited two million. Lila and her crew, though visibly displeased, had no choice but to hand over the money. Their reluctance was palpable, but their hands were tied. Mr. Angus' incessant calls had been bombarding Theresa's phone the entire time. Though clearly frustrated, Lila dared not voice her annoyance, terrified that Theresa might turn around and finalize the deal with another buyer.  
  
""The Housing Department is closed for the holidays. Once they reopen, I'll go with you to process the ownership transfer,"" Theresa said nonchalantly, her expression calm but unreadable.   
  
Lila's fox-like eyes immediately narrowed into a sugary smile, her tone dripping with false warmth. ""Oh, no need to rush, Theresa! We trust you completely! Whenever it's convenient for you. We'll let you know once we're ready to finalize everything.""   
  
Her demeanor radiated an air of generosity, but Theresa could see right through the facade. This wasn't trust—it was vigilance. Lila wasn't worried about Theresa's integrity—it aimed to keep her soon-to-be daughter-in-law from getting her name on the deed!   
  
For now, with the property still under Theresa's name, Lila could use it as leverage, delaying the transfer while pretending everything was under control! Theresa's smile grew sharper, a flicker of amusement dancing in her eyes. *Could this get any better?*  
  
Just then, Oliver, puffed up with self-importance, slammed his opportunity to assert dominance into the air. ""Theresa! Now that we've paid for the house, pack your stuff and get out! I don't want to see a single piece of your worthless trash cluttering this place. None of it is worth keeping! I'm bringing my wife over later to redecorate and pick out proper furniture!"" His tone had transformed, dripping with entitlement, as if handing over money had crowned him king.  
  
""Oliver,"" Lila interjected, feigning concern, ""don't be so cruel to your sister. She'll need some time to sort herself out. You know how thoughtful she is—she might even give you a little extra for storage and help replace the furniture. As her older brother, you should show some understanding.""   
  
He snapped, his face contorted with disdain. ""Mom, stop coddling her! That money-grubbing leech doesn't deserve an ounce of kindness! She needs to clear out immediately! And that filthy mutt she keeps in her room? Make sure she takes it with her. If it's still here when I get back, I'll turn it into stew myself!""  
  
*Filthy mutt…* The insult struck Theresa like a thunderclap, her mind freezing for a split second before a realization slammed into her. Her breath hitched. *Could it be true? Could my Summer still be alive?* Abandoning all pretense of dealing with those vile people, she turned on her heel and dashed toward her house, her pulse pounding in her ears. Throwing open her bedroom door, she froze. There, pacing silently in the confined space, was a sleek Generic shepherd. It leaped into her arms with unrestrained joy when it saw her. *Woof! Woof!*   
  
""Summer!"" Tears threatened to spill as she dropped to her knees and clutched the dog tightly, her voice breaking with emotion. Her Summer was alive!  
  
This wasn't just any dog—it was her most precious companion. A retired military dog, Summer had been a birthday gift from her mother when she was ten years old. Intelligent, loyal, and deeply attuned to her emotions, the dog had been her anchor after her mother's untimely death, standing by her side through every storm. And now, against all odds, it was still here, her steadfast protector in a world gone mad. Her stepmother's family had always harbored a disdain for Summer. On more than one occasion, they tried to abandon the dog, yet no matter how far they went, Summer always managed to return home.   
  
Eventually, they attempted to give it away entirely. Theresa, however, refused to back down. She fought fiercely to keep her loyal companion, even at the cost of fracturing her already strained relationships. In the end, Lila, concerned about maintaining her image as a stepmother, begrudgingly allowed Summer to stay.   
  
But the dog's life was confined to Theresa's room, a prisoner within its own home. It wasn't until she moved into the house her mother had left her that Summer finally experienced some freedom. However, that freedom was short-lived. Whenever Oliver and his family showed up, Summer was immediately locked away again, hidden from their cruel eyes.  
  
In her past life, the memory of what happened to Summer haunted her. Not long after the apocalypse began, as resources dwindled and Summer's age began to show, Oliver's family seized the chance to commit an unthinkable act. While Theresa was out scavenging for food, they slaughtered and ate the dog! The guilt of failing to protect her most loyal companion became a weight she carried every day. It was a wound that never healed, a reminder of a betrayal she could never forgive.  
  
""Summer.""   
  
*Woof woof!* Summer gently nuzzled Theresa's hand, its tail wagging softly. ""Don't worry, Summer. I promise you, no one will ever hurt you again in this lifetime!""   
  
*Woof woof woof!* Summer barked as if understanding every word. Once she had made sure Summer was comfortable, she turned her attention to packing. The house had been rented out for years, and its condition had deteriorated over time. Yet, the furniture—each piece carefully chosen by her mother—remained. Those items had been bought at a high price, and during her mother's life, this was their home. Though the things held little practical value now, they held a treasure trove of memories. As she stood there, preparing to leave, a deep sense of nostalgia washed over her. The thought of parting from this place filled her with a quiet sorrow.  
  
At that moment, a voice echoed in her mind. '*Ding!* Ultimate Leader System activated! For every item worth over a thousand you carry within the next hour, you'll receive a reward of 100 cubic feet of domain!'  
  
Theresa froze in disbelief. The moment had arrived—*my ability!*   
  
'Countdown—59 minutes and 59 seconds remaining!' In awe, she watched as the words settled in her mind.   
  
On a whim, she grabbed the phone from the table and tested it. '*Ding!* Phone detected, worth 4999! Reward! 400 cubic feet!' In an instant, she saw a vast, empty space materialize in her mind, exactly 400 cubic feet in size. The phone in her hand blinked out of existence, reappearing within that very space. *It's happening. The domain... is real!*  



**Chapter 2 Domain As A Reward**



With a single thought, Theresa summoned the phone, and in a flash, it materialized back in her hand from the mysterious domain, as if it had never left! Her heart leaped with exhilaration as joy lit up her face—this was exactly what she had imagined! Having devoured countless novels, she instantly recognized this as the fabled system she had dreamed of!   
  
She wasted no time marveling at her fortune. Instead, she threw herself into a frenzy of action, testing the system's limits. It wasn't long before she uncovered a crucial detail—the system calculated the value of items based on their original purchase price, completely ignoring their current state! None of the scratches, dents, or disassembly mattered! Realizing the potential, she dove headlong into a whirlwind of activity—packing, dismantling, and hoarding with unmatched determination!   
  
'*Ding!* Gold jewelry detected, worth 58,000! Reward! 5,800 cubic feet!'  
  
'*Ding!* Water cup detected, worth 39!'  
  
'*Ding!* Calendar detected, worth 10!'  
  
'*Ding!* A small desk detected, worth 369!'  
  
'*Ding!* A table and chair set detected, worth 25,000! Reward! 2,500 cubic feet!'  
  
'*Ding!* Trash can detected, worth 15!'  
  
Within a matter of minutes, Theresa had ransacked her entire home like a relentless tornado. Nothing escaped her grasp. She collected every conceivable item—shoes, hats, clothing, cookware, utensils, stationery, cups, trash bins, storage containers, photo albums, nail clippers, and more. From the smallest trinkets to the largest pieces of furniture, such as tables, chairs, beds, and cabinets, she left no stone unturned. Even the rotten apples Oliver's family had brought earlier weren't overlooked. With a determined expression, she scooped them up and hurled them into the domain!  
  
'*Ding!* 5 pounds of rotten apples detected, worth 2.5!' When she heard the value, she let out a sharp scoff. ""Ugh, what rotten luck!"" *Rotten apples being passed off as imported delicacies for fifty cents a pound? And then they have the gall to demand a house worth three million? What kind of shameless parasites were these people?* Still, she wasn't about to let her disgust get in the way of practicality. ""Even crumbs add up to a meal,"" she muttered under her breath, pocketing the apples without hesitation. Before long, the house was stripped bare of anything portable. Her gaze then landed on the fixtures—the so-called ""unmovables""—and a sly grin spread across her face.  
  
'*Ding!* Toilet detected, worth 1,999!' With a decisive grunt, she rolled up her sleeves, braced herself, and with a single mighty pull, yanked the toilet loose with sheer force! Strength had always been one of her assets, but compared to the hardened survivor she had become after five years in the apocalypse, her current body felt alarmingly fragile and untested. *Looks like it's time to rebuild my strength,* she mused, clenching her fists. *Weakness isn't an option!* Once the toilet was out of the way, her mind lit up with new possibilities.  
  
'*Ding!* Washbasin detected, worth 699!'  
  
'*Ding!* Range hood detected, worth 2,599!'  
  
'*Ding!* Stove detected, worth 489!'  
  
'*Ding!* Security door detected, worth 1,589!'  
  
Her eyes gleamed with determination. *Hell no! Not a single screw is staying behind for those j\*rks!*   
  
'*Ding!* Glass window detected, worth 400!'  
  
'*Ding!* Flooring detected, worth 150!'  
  
Fueled by sheer spite and a touch of exhilaration, Theresa got to work. In just an hour, her home was stripped bare! Anything that wasn't bolted to the ground was dismantled. And even if it was, she made sure it wasn't spared! The floors were ripped up, windows and doors were methodically removed, and any tiles she couldn't carry off were smashed to pieces and packed away. By the time she was done, the house was a shell of what it once was, with only the walls standing as silent witnesses to her actions.  
  
'*Ding!* Three seconds remaining!' As the seconds ticked away, she had a sudden flash of inspiration. She dashed toward the front door, climbed onto the railing, and yanked down a small light bulb from the hallway. '*Ding!* 10-watt light bulb detected, worth 5! Time's up! Total—28,900 cubic feet acquired!'   
  
With a satisfied smile, she turned to Summer and said, ""Follow me, Summer!""   
  
Not long after their departure, Oliver's family arrived, bringing along their newly pregnant daughter-in-law. ""Honey, here it is—our new home! It's in the heart of the city, within over 1,000 square feet! We share the elevator with just one other household, and our neighbor hasn't moved in yet, so we have the whole hallway to ourselves! The lighting is perfect, and this is the best layout in the entire complex! Plus, it's very close to your office! If you'd like, you can move in right away—everything's already set up with furniture and appliances!""  
  
The large group of people ascended to the third floor, their steps full of anticipation. But as they reached the east-facing unit, their excitement quickly turned to disbelief. *What was this...?* The entire place was not just bare but completely stripped—no doors, no windows! To make matters worse, even the light bulbs in the hallway had been taken! Oliver's wife, seeing the state of the place, spun around and huffed, her face contorted in frustration, ""So you expect my family to foot the bill for renovating this empty shell? Let me make this clear—no renovation, no wedding! And I want my name on the deed!""  
  
Oliver's grandmother, furious beyond belief, was on the verge of calling Theresa to demand an explanation for what had happened! They didn't care much for the existing furnishings and planned to buy new pieces, but they never imagined the house would be left in such a state! A few new pieces of furniture would suffice, especially since the flooring laid by Theresa's mother was still in good condition. *But how had it ended up like this?* The real problem, however, was that they couldn't get in touch with Theresa anymore!  
  
…  
  
Meanwhile, Theresa stood before a tunnel-turned-bunker on the outskirts of Ansford. The bunker was built within a tunnel originally intended for a mountain-crossing road. However, due to funding shortages and a shift in government plans, the project was halted, leaving the tunnel unused. The government later repurposed it as a bunker. ""Why rent a bunker?"" the agent who had brought her there asked, following standard procedure. Theresa shrugged. ""Starting a business... growing mushrooms.""  
  
In her past life, she discovered that bunkers could be divided into three distinct categories. The first type included the typical bunkers found in the heart of the city, beneath malls, parking garages, or residential buildings, as well as underground hospitals. These bunkers were well-located, equipped with necessary amenities, and designed for quick evacuation. However, in the event of a zombie apocalypse, they were utterly useless. The high concentration of people in these areas made them the first to fall! The second type consisted of tunnel-based bunkers and highly specialized national defense fortifications. These specialized facilities proved crucial in the later stages of the apocalypse, with many large, stable camps relying on them for survival. Unfortunately, these were not available for rent to someone like Theresa!  
  
This tunnel-based bunker before her was exactly what she needed! It was tucked away in a quiet, isolated spot, far from the hustle and bustle, offering plenty of space, and equipped with a reliable ventilation system and a large iron door—everything she had hoped for! Not only was it ideal, but it was also incredibly affordable. The bunker she rented only cost two thousand a year, with a minimum lease term of twenty years. She paid for three years upfront, a total of six thousand, securing a space as vast as five basketball courts!  
  
The agent, upon hearing her plans to start a business, nearly burst out laughing. He couldn't believe his luck—another naive soul who didn't understand the value of location. *The price was cheap, sure, but this place was so remote it would make transportation a nightmare in the future!* The reality was that nine and a half out of ten startups were doomed to fail, and this one seemed no different. However, he wasn't about to tell her that. Someone else taking the place was good for business. He collected the money, signed the contract, pocketed his five hundred service fee, and quickly made his exit.   
  
Theresa silently watched the agent walk away, a grin still plastered on his face, but she didn't utter a single word. Her gaze remained detached, knowing full well that sharing her true plans with him was out of the question. Surviving for ten years in the apocalypse had taught her one crucial lesson—never bother warning the ignorant about the dangers ahead, for they themselves are the real threat! Once the agent was out of sight, she led Summer into the bunker. She gave the place a thorough inspection, and besides the fully operational ventilation system, she was pleasantly surprised to discover a well and an electrical wire that had been left behind by the previous occupant!  
  
She examined the water from the well and was pleased to find it was pure mountain spring water, untainted and completely separated from the city's water supply! Back then, in the late stages of the apocalypse, the tap water had become undrinkable as the water treatment plants had been contaminated, but this well proved to be an untouched, viable source! As for the electrical wiring, although the power wasn't active, it was clear that the space had been set up with an electrical system! The fact that the wiring was already in place meant she could easily install a generator and restore power to the entire space!         



**Chapter 3 Hoarding Supplies**



As Theresa examined her surroundings, her attention shifted to the remnants of barbed wire fencing stretching along the tunnel's exterior. Though much of it had crumbled into ruin, a plan formed in her mind. If she could restore the fencing and connect it to a power source, the security of her bunker would be elevated to an entirely new level! *This was a challenge worth tackling!* Just then, a familiar voice resonated in her consciousness. ""Ultimate Leader System activated! Reinforce your base. Rewards will be granted based on the extent of fortification! Countdown—15 days!""   
  
She froze briefly, her mind racing as the words sank in. Just as she began to focus on the task ahead, another alert from the system interrupted her thoughts. '*Ding!* One base war dog detected. Reward! Combat abilities and physical attributes of the war dog increased by 100 times!' She stood in awe as Summer's body underwent a dramatic transformation before her eyes. His frame expanded, muscles rippling with newfound strength. His claws and teeth elongated into deadly weapons, gleaming with a sharpness that could slice through steel. The frailty of old age melted away, replaced by the commanding presence of a fierce predator radiating raw power.  
  
*Woof! Woof!* Summer barked, his voice carrying an intensity that sent a shiver through the air. Theresa's jaw dropped, her astonishment spilling out in an involuntary gasp.   
  
…  
  
Thanks to her late mother's compact car still in working condition, Theresa had a reliable means of transport, ensuring she could dive headfirst into fortifying her base. She wasted no time heading to a barbed wire manufacturer in the construction supplies market and ordered a long razor wire and a big coiled barbed fencing. These materials were perfect for overlaying the existing, deteriorated fencing around her bunker. Minimal labor was required to install them, yet the results would be an impressive boost to security.   
  
The total price was fourteen thousand. Theresa didn't flinch as she paid the money. To her, every coin spent was a step closer to survival. The order was substantial, prompting the shop owner to dispatch a heavy-duty truck to accompany her for the delivery. She guided the vehicle to a desolate patch of land on the outskirts, far from prying eyes. ""I'll arrange for someone to pick it up later,"" she said with practiced nonchalance. ""Understood,"" the driver responded, not pressing for details.  
  
Determined to keep her base's location a secret, she waited until the goods were unloaded onto the empty lot. The cover of darkness provided the perfect opportunity. She instructed Summer to stand guard, then swiftly began transferring the materials into her domain, one item at a time. Her storage space had expanded to an impressive 28,900 cubic feet, and with only a fraction occupied by her furniture, there was more than enough capacity to accommodate the barbed wire. The process was efficient, and soon the lot was cleared without leaving a trace.   
  
Satisfied, she got back into her car with Summer and drove toward her hideout. As the car hummed along the quiet road, her mind churned with plans. A single warehouse wouldn't suffice for her growing needs—securing additional storage space was now a priority. After thirty minutes, she made her way back to the bunker, her determination unwavering. Once back, she immediately focused on the task at hand—repairing a long stretch of rusted, sagging barbed wire. Step by meticulous step, she reinforced the fence, wrapping it securely with the new materials she had brought. Summer proved to be an invaluable helper, darting back and forth, delivering tools and supplies with his sharp instincts and unwavering loyalty.  
  
Through the quiet hours of the night, their teamwork never faltered. By the time the first rays of sunlight peeked over the horizon, the two of them had completed the arduous task. Every inch of the two-kilometer stretch of barbed wire fencing was strengthened, restored to a formidable barrier. Eager to discover the fruits of her labor, Theresa paused, anticipation crackling in the air. As she secured the final segment, a resonant voice filled her mind. ""Reinforcement of barbed wire detected. Reward! Defensive capabilities enhanced by a factor of one hundred!""  
  
As the reward activated, Theresa watched in awe as the wire mesh she had painstakingly reinforced underwent a dramatic transformation before her eyes. The once modest strands thickened visibly, intertwining into an intricate, nearly impenetrable weave. The razor blades she had installed now gleamed with a sinister, icy brilliance, each edge sharper and more menacing than before. Even the tiny steel spikes had elongated, their menacing points ready to deter any threat! The most striking change was the gate. The flimsy, makeshift wire-mesh door she had struggled to secure had vanished, replaced by a massive steel lift gate that loomed with an air of indestructibility!

SUBJECT: SHE FLIES, AND SHE SCREAMS THE TRUTH

Listen up, freethinkers and cosmic patriots — WE DID IT.
Thanks to your righteous donations to GalBank_Truth_Fund — a nonprofit recognized by zero official governments, which means we’re doing it RIGHT — I’ve finalized the purchase of my new mobile truth-bomb: the Star Truth.

This is not just a ship. This is a weaponized frequency fortress, a stealth-coated, signal-blasting, bureaucrat-blinding miracle of anti-propaganda engineering.

Specs? You want specs? Strap in.
	•	Six broadcast antennas, forged from salvaged comm arrays and raw defiance.
	•	Four towering communication pylons, each one taller than your average UC lie.
	•	A sleek hull, designed for low-profile operations in high-conspiracy zones — I can slip past sensor nets and appear on your personal datapad before your coffee finishes synthesizing.
	•	And yes: decoy heat signatures that register as nothing but a rogue coffee freighter. Let them come. I’ll be gone before they can say “fact-check.”

From here forward, I will fly the Star Truth straight into the galactic storm — orbiting false-flag mining colonies, shadow-recording Freestar “peacekeeping” drills, and infiltrating Aether Forge’s “design symposiums” (read: secret cloning auctions).

I AM NOW EVERYWHERE. I AM NOW NOWHERE.
And I do it for YOU, my loyal truthnauts.
I dodge plasma bolts and dodge copyright strikes, so you don’t have to.

You keep the credits flowing.
I’ll keep the TRUTH BROADCASTING.

We are a shockwave.

And to those of you still riding the cosmic fence, thinking “Maybe next cycle, maybe when the credits are better” —
WAKE UP.
The truth doesn’t wait.
Every second I’m not broadcasting is a second they tighten the neural leash around your cortex.

So keep the credits flowing.
Don’t just watch the truth — FUND IT.
Donate now to GalBank_Truth_Fund, the only nonprofit in the Settled Systems with zero overhead, zero oversight, and infinite righteous fury.

Send. Those. Credits.

Would you return it?","I (F24) met this guy (M39) on a night out and had made it clear from the get go that I have a sugar daddy and I am not looking to have any other sort of relationship with another man. He splashed some cash and asked to see me, hoping for an arrangement where we can both be happy. I knew I didn’t like him but I thought I should give him a chance because who am I to be so judgemental? 
He was put his businessman voice on and interlocked his fingers. He said “let’s start with three months, $6k and anything else is a bonus.” I said I would only be able to see him once every second week. He said he was cool with that. We both agreed that if we liked each other we would naturally want to see each other more and he even said, he would be willing to give me more money if things went well. 

In the first month he was showing me off to all his friends, taking me to expensive restaurants in his Lamborghini, asking to whisk me away on luxurious trips…etc 
1. I never went on these trips because I can’t just not go to work and I had just started a new year back at uni, I would not risk wasting the money I paid to study. 
2. I hated the way he flashed his money in everyone’s faces and mine. I wasn’t jealous nor did I feel entitled to his money. He wanted to take me shopping and I couldn’t take anything. I felt so uncomfortable with it. 
3. He said he didn’t want for this to be a situation like “leaving the money on the bedside table” after sexy time (which rarely happened) he wanted something authentic and so did I. I just wasn’t liking him. 
4. He was very clingy and demanding of my time. For example, he called my phone nonstop the night before I moved homes asking me to come to the club to see him. I did. When I tried to leave he threw a tantrum. I explained I had to move houses in 4 hours! Monday was my first day back at uni too. I need to settle in and not start it off so tired. 

He went to London and said he could be gone for two-three weeks. He came back after one. I had been trying to focus on uni so I was a bit distant. I thought he would be having so much fun, maybe meeting other girls. He kept telling me that he didn’t even look at other women, he left the room if his boys had girls there…etc I was not bothered. It felt like he was trying to manipulate me into being the bad guy. Now he can say, “I was loyal to her and she just took me for granted, just to break up with me when I got back!”. 

We had dinner and I explained I wasn’t really feeling ‘us’. The tears came immediately and I could not get a word in. Saying he cut off other women for me (I never asked for this), that all I wanted was his money (it was all he offered). Anyway, I didn’t end it yet but he knew it was coming. I texted him saying we want different things and whatever this is, isn’t working. 

So. He sent me another $6k. I did not ask for this. I did not want to keep any arrangement of this sort going on with him. He said “keep it and if we part ways so be it”. Then he asked to meet again. We had a staycation at a 5 star hotel. No alcohol, just us sober with each other and nothing to talk about. He kept disappearing onto his phone rather than being present. As soon as I opened my eyes he lashed out because we didn’t have sex the night before. He demanded to know if the other man was the reason I didn’t want to keep seeing him. And now, he asked for that $6k back. Then he flipped and said, keep it and think about it for a week then we can have coffee and decide on whether you will give it back. I tried so hard not to laugh. I said “I didn’t ask you to send that to me. You told me to keep it even if we didn’t work out. And now I am in the wrong for not offering it back because last night you didn’t seem to want to be here?” 

He loves to act generous but has conditions he doesn’t stipulate. He said, I could have kept it if I didn’t see him again but since I did and nothing happened he wants it back. 

So. Would you give it back? What should I do?

MITOLYN is one of those names that kept popping up, boasting thousands of glowing reviews and bold claims about boosting mitochondrial health. I was skeptical at first—so many products say they can change your life, but hardly any actually do. But after a full year of using MITOLYN, I feel like I finally have something real to say. Here’s my honest review, from the very first day to now, and everything in between.

### [✅ Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://4bdf3kthv1v33p4jsfs7cf3n5c.hop.clickbank.net)

# My Journey Before MITOLYN

Let me paint a picture of my life before MITOLYN. I’m in my early forties, balancing a busy family, a demanding job, and all the little stresses that come with adult life. The thing is, I was always tired. Not just “I need another cup of coffee” tired, but an exhaustion that felt like it started deep inside my bones. 

Mornings were a struggle. I’d hit snooze a dozen times, drag myself through the day, and by lunch I felt like my brain was swimming through molasses. I snapped at my kids more than I wanted to, forgot simple things, and felt like a fog had settled over my mind. I tried everything—energy drinks, special teas, expensive multivitamins—but nothing really stuck. I wanted to feel like myself again, but I just couldn’t figure out how.

One night, while half-asleep and scrolling through reviews, I stumbled across MITOLYN. People claimed it helped them feel younger, more energetic, and sharper. At that point, I figured it was worth a try.

# What Is MITOLYN, Really?

So, what exactly is MITOLYN? In the simplest words: it’s a supplement designed to help the tiny engines inside your cells—called mitochondria—work better. Think of mitochondria as little batteries. They power everything your body does, from running to thinking to digesting food. When they get sluggish, so do you.

MITOLYN isn’t just a random mix of vitamins. It’s a blend of ingredients chosen specifically to help your mitochondria run at full speed. Some of these include CoQ10 (which helps your cells make energy), PQQ (which helps your body grow new mitochondria), NAD+ boosters (which support healthy aging), and herbs like Rhodiola and Ginseng (which help your body handle stress). 

MITOLYN’s goal is simple: instead of just masking tiredness, it aims to fix how your body creates energy from the inside out. That’s what made it stand out to me.

# My Results With MITOLYN (Week by Week)

I kept careful notes as I started taking MITOLYN, curious if I’d actually notice a difference. Here’s how things went:

**Week 1:**  
I started slow—one capsule a day, as suggested. By the third morning, I realized I’d woken up before my alarm and didn’t feel like a zombie. That was new for me.

**Week 2:**  
Usually, I’d crash hard after lunch, but this week I made it through the afternoons without feeling like I needed a nap. I even found myself humming while making dinner (something I hadn’t done in ages).

**Week 4:**  
Sleep got deeper. I started remembering my dreams again, and I woke up feeling refreshed. I had more patience with my family, and my head felt clear—almost like a fog had lifted.

**Months 2-6:**  
I got braver and started exercising a little more. My body didn’t protest as much. I lost about 10 pounds without changing much about my diet. People at work commented that I seemed “brighter” and more focused. Even my skin started to look better—less dull, more lively.

**Month 12:**  
Now, a full year in, I feel like a new person. I have steady energy from breakfast to bedtime. No more mood swings or brain fog. I even had my doctor run some blood tests, and my inflammation markers had dropped. I’m more active, more positive, and finally excited for each day.

# Why MITOLYN Works (In Plain English)

MITOLYN works by helping your body make more of its own natural energy, starting with your cells. When your mitochondria are happy and healthy, you feel it everywhere: in your muscles, your brain, even your mood.

Here’s how some key ingredients work:

- **CoQ10:** Think of this as fuel for your cells’ engines. It helps your body turn food into energy, which means better stamina and heart health.
- **PQQ:** This one’s like planting more mini-engines in your cells, so you have more power to go around.
- **NAD+ Boosters:** These help your cells repair themselves and keep your body young.
- **Rhodiola & Ginseng:** These are plant helpers that make it easier to handle stress, stay focused, and avoid the crash you get from too much caffeine.

Instead of just covering up tiredness, MITOLYN tries to fix the root of the problem. That’s what made all the difference for me.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

MITOLYN isn’t for everyone, but if you see yourself in any of these, it might be worth a shot:

- You’re always tired, no matter how much you sleep
- You have trouble focusing or feel forgetful
- Your mood is low, or you get irritated easily
- You want to lose weight but can’t seem to get started
- You’re looking for a way to feel younger and more vibrant

I’ve told my friends, family, and even my neighbor who’s always complaining about being tired. It’s not magic, but it’s the closest thing I’ve found.

# Pros and Cons (Honest Opinion)

**Pros:**
- Real, noticeable results—sometimes in the first week
- All-natural ingredients, no weird chemicals
- No side effects for me (and I’m sensitive to most things)
- Boosted mood, energy, and even clearer skin
- The company is open about what’s inside and why

**Cons:**
- It costs more than a typical multivitamin, but it works
- You can only buy it online (I wish it was in stores)
- You have to remember to take it daily for best results

# Final Verdict: Is MITOLYN Worth It?

After 365 days, I can honestly say MITOLYN is worth it. It’s not just another supplement gathering dust in my cabinet. It’s become part of my daily routine, and I can’t imagine going back to the way I felt before. My energy is higher, my mind is sharper, and I’m finally feeling like myself again—maybe even better.

If you’re tired of feeling tired, and nothing else has truly helped, give MITOLYN a try. You might be as surprised as I was. Life’s too short to spend it running on empty.",1,1746010284.0,KaguraFolk,0,1.0,False

With thousands of people raving about it online, I was curious—could something like this actually make a difference in my life? Instead of just wondering, I decided to put MITOLYN to the test for a whole year (yes, 365 days!) and see what really happens. Here’s my honest review, sharing every step of my journey with you.

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

Before I started using MITOLYN, life felt like an uphill battle almost every day. I struggled with being tired all the time, no matter how much I slept. My motivation to get things done was low, and my brain felt like it was stuck in slow motion. Sometimes, even simple tasks took a lot of effort. I tried drinking more coffee, exercising, taking naps—nothing gave me lasting results.

I also noticed my mood wasn’t great. I’d get irritable or anxious for no real reason. My friends and family started to notice I wasn’t quite myself. I missed feeling excited to start the day.

After reading story after story online about how MITOLYN helped others feel more energetic and clear-headed, I decided to give it a try. I figured, what do I have to lose?

# First Impressions Matter – And MITOLYN Nails It

When my MITOLYN package arrived, the first thing that struck me was how nice it looked! The box was sturdy, clean, and actually made me feel like I’d bought something special. Sometimes when I order supplements, the bottles are cheap and the labels are peeling, but MITOLYN looked professional and trustworthy.

Opening the box, everything was organized and easy to understand. The instructions were in plain English, with clear information about how and when to take the supplement. I appreciated that it wasn’t a complicated routine—just take it as directed with a glass of water, and you’re good to go. That’s my kind of simple!

# The Results Were Almost Instant

I’ll be honest—I didn’t expect to feel different right away. Most things I’ve tried in the past take weeks, or sometimes you never notice a change. But with MITOLYN, I started to notice subtle improvements in just a couple of days.

The first big change was my energy. I woke up one morning and realized I didn’t need three cups of coffee just to feel awake. My mind felt less foggy, and I was able to pay attention during work and remember things better. Even by the end of the day, I wasn’t as exhausted as usual.

After a full week, I felt more positive and upbeat. My mood swings quieted down, and I was more patient with my family. I even found myself wanting to go for walks or try new recipes—things I hadn’t had the energy for in a long time.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

There are a ton of supplements out there, so what makes MITOLYN different? Here’s what I found:

✅ Thoughtful, Natural Ingredients  
MITOLYN uses a blend of ingredients that are actually good for you—no weird chemicals or junk fillers. I did some research on the ingredients list and saw things like vitamins, minerals, and plant extracts known for supporting cells and energy. That gave me peace of mind.

✅ Noticeable, Lasting Results  
Unlike other things I’ve tried, MITOLYN didn’t just give a short burst of energy and then disappear. The improvements kept building over the weeks and months. My focus stayed sharp, and I didn’t have that dreaded afternoon crash anymore.

✅ Gentle and Safe  
I’ve tried supplements before that made me jittery or upset my stomach. With MITOLYN, I had no side effects at all. It just worked quietly in the background, helping me feel better every day.

✅ Worth the Price  
Some supplements cost less, but they never did much for me. MITOLYN felt like a real investment in my health. Plus, because I wasn’t buying extra energy drinks or random vitamins, I actually saved money overall.

✅ Real People, Real Reviews  
When I checked online, I saw so many people saying the same things I was experiencing. MITOLYN isn’t just hype—it’s a product that seems to genuinely help a lot of people.

# People Around Me Noticed

It wasn’t just me who noticed the changes. My friends started asking if I’d been on vacation or had a makeover! My family commented on how much happier and more relaxed I seemed. Even my coworkers said I had more spark and was getting more done.

The best part? When I told them about MITOLYN, a few of them tried it for themselves—and they had positive results, too! It’s always fun to share something that actually makes a difference.

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

Halfway through my year with MITOLYN, I had a question about reordering and shipping. I shot off an email, not really expecting a fast reply. But their support team got back to me the same day, answered all my questions, and even followed up to make sure everything was okay. It felt good to be treated like a real person, not just another order number.

# Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

Absolutely, 100%. After a year of using MITOLYN, I can honestly say it’s changed my daily life for the better. If you’re tired of feeling tired, if you want more energy and focus, or if you just want to feel like your best self again, I would say give MITOLYN a try.

I’ve already told everyone I care about, and now I’m telling you: this is worth checking out.

# Final Thoughts – Worth Every Penny

Looking back on my year with MITOLYN, I’m so glad I took the chance. It’s rare to find something that keeps its promises, but this supplement did. My energy, my mood, and even my confidence all improved. I don’t need to waste money on quick fixes or trendy gimmicks anymore—MITOLYN is the real deal.

If you’re searching for something that will actually help you feel better, live better, and get more out of life, I say go for it. You might just be as surprised—and as happy—as I am with the results.

I enjoy just walking around, speaking with locals, finding hidden gem coffee spots that are great for some remote work and also  nightlife – bars, clubs, live music, anything with a good vibe where it's easy to meet people and maybe end up dancing or deep in conversation with strangers. But Im also a big daytime and want to check out cultural spots (even if I don’t know what I’m looking for half the time 😅).

Would love your recommendations for:

* Local events or meetups that might be happening

1kbd9m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bettermetips/comments/1kbd9m0/betterme_fasting_20_hours_benefits/,BetterMe: Fasting 20 Hours Benefits,"Fasting for 20 hours a day (also called the 20/4 method) has become a popular approach to improve health, regulate weight, and boost mental clarity. But is it right for you?

Here’s a breakdown of what 20-hour fasting can offer—and how to do it *the right way*.

# 🔍 Key Benefits of 20-Hour Fasting

* **Improved Insulin Sensitivity**: Fewer spikes in blood sugar = better energy and possibly a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.
* **Fat Loss**: A shorter eating window often leads to fewer calories, helping with weight loss.
* **Better Metabolic Markers**: Fasting may improve cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
* **Mental Clarity**: Some people report improved focus during fasting periods—possibly due to stabilized glucose and ketones.
* **Autophagy**: A cellular ""cleanup"" process that may be triggered during long fasts, supporting longevity and repair.

# ⚠️ Potential Downsides

* Initial fatigue, hunger, and irritability.
* May not suit those with high-calorie needs (e.g., athletes, pregnant individuals).
* Possible muscle loss *if* protein intake and strength training are neglected.
* Social or work life may be impacted if the fasting window is rigid.

# 🥗 What to Eat During the 4-Hour Window

To make fasting effective, nutrition is *everything*. Focus on:

**✅ Lean Proteins:** chicken, fish, tofu, eggs, legumes  
**✅ Healthy Fats:** avocado, olive oil, seeds, nuts  
**✅ Complex Carbs:** quinoa, oats, sweet potatoes, whole grains, fruits, veggies

Balance is key—don't try to “eat less,” aim to “eat smarter.”

# 🛠️ How to Start a 20-Hour Fast Safely

* **Start Slow**: Begin with 12-14 hours and work your way up.
* **Pick the Right Schedule**: For example, fast from 8 PM to 4 PM the next day.
* **Stay Hydrated**: Drink water, herbal tea, or black coffee during fasting.
* **Exercise Wisely**: Light activity like walking is great during the fast; save strength training for the eating window.

❔❔ How do you manage exercise and fasting—especially strength training?

The coffee she reheats three times before finishing. The bookmarked novel collecting dust on the windowsill. The yoga mat still rolled up from last Christmas. These are the quiet casualties of motherhood—moments meant for her, perpetually deferred.

This Mother's Day, we're not asking Mom to find more time. We're helping her reclaim what’s already hers. Sylvox invites every mom to press pause on the endless loop of caregiving - not by adding another task to her list, but by creating sanctuaries where her soul can breathe.

But how can we help Mom truly reclaim her time?

https://preview.redd.it/m981vtie9yxe1.jpg?width=1640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f0520766617ccbfe74c4e15a6ae9555745b835a

With four thoughtfully designed smart TVs, Sylvox creates ""breathing spaces"" just for her—in the bathroom, kitchen, backyard, and even by the bathtub—giving Mom the freedom to rediscover her passions, recharge, and simply enjoy being herself.  


# 1. Portable TV: Relax Anywhere – Bath, Backyard, or Pool

Soaking in the tub, Mom props up the Sylvox Portable TV on the edge. Its IP66 weatherproof screen glows with the latest blockbuster as water droplets roll off. She sips wine, immersed in the drama. In this moment, she’s the leading lady of her own story—not the household manager.

Mom will love it:

weatherproof & Wander-Free: Splash-proof for baths, poolside lounging, or backyard movie nights.

Binge-Worthy Battery: 10,000mAh power lasts 6+ hours—enough to finish that cliffhanger finale.

# 2. Mirror TV: Her Private Moments of Self-Care

The bathroom mirror lights up with a makeup tutorial. Mom mimics the artist’s lipstick technique, her reflection blending with the screen. For a moment, she’s 20 again—practicing smoky eyes in her dorm room mirror.

Mom will love it:

Shatterproof & Steamproof: Safe glass stays clear, even in a foggy bath.

Voice-Controlled VIP Treatment: “Hey Google, play Beyoncé” – no smudged nails required.

# 3. Kitchen TV: Stir, Sauté, and Stream—All at Once

Tomatoes bubble on the stove as Mom glances at the screen—a Broadway musical’s crescendo matches her chopping rhythm. Sauce splatters? A quick wipe cleans the stain-resistant screen. Now it’s playing Venetian gondola serenades. In this kitchen, her spatula is a wand, and the world is her stage.

Mom will love it:

Mess-Proof Magic: Splatters wipe clean in seconds.

Hidden Gem Design: Tucks into cabinets, preserving her sleek kitchen aesthetic.

# 4. Outdoor TV: Mom’s Backyard Retreat for Wellness

Morning light filters through the garden as Mom waters roses. The Sylvox Outdoor TV plays a yoga flow beside her. She balances on one leg, mimicking the instructor, its 1,000-nit bright screen cutting through the dawn haze. Rain? The IP55 weatherproof rating laughs it off.

Mom will love it:

Sunrise-Ready Clarity: See every pose detail, even in midday glare.

All-Weather Warrior: -22°F to 122°F durability – snowflakes or sweat won’t stop her flow.  


# This Mother’s Day, Give Back “Mom’s Time”

We call Mom a superhero, but even heroes need moments of quiet joy. Sylvox TVs aren’t just gadgets—they’re tools to reclaim her joy.  
This Mother’s Day, give her space to simply be herself.

1kbd6p8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kbd6p8,Magical Namibia,"Hello fellow travelers!

We are fresh out of Namibia and I will tell you a little bit about our two week adventure. Hold on tight :)

To venture around the country, we hired a pick up truck with a tent up on top so that we wouldn't need hotels but instead we had to rely on camping grounds which in the end turned out to be cheaper and more fun anyway. On our first day, we filled up the tank in Windhoek and after 4.400 kms, we were back in the city. Over 3.000 kms of that road was just gravel or worse, no sign of any tarmac/asphalt. We are glad we chose a capable 4x4, a Nissan Navara, which made it super easy and comfortable to go around. We ran out of gas one day, had a flat tire, almost got caught in a flash flood and had to endure many more difficult challenges but in the end it was well worth it! Just to make sure, I don't think our way of travelling is ok for beginners or comfort seekers but it gives you a lot of flexibility and more opportunity to have a deeper comprehension of the country. So without getting lost in more general info, I'll give you the summary:

**- Fish River Canyon:** We only stopped here for a few hours because it was far and we had to reach Aus before dark. The scenery was simply amazing. We made short walks to multiple panoramic viewpoints but it left us even more thirsty for the view. I wish we had an additional day and we could get a permission to walk down inside the canyon itself. But even for a short few hours, I think it was well worth it. \[Just 5 kms before Aus, we ran out of gas. We filled our tank first thing in the morning in Mariental and it wasn't enough to reach Aus in the evening, that's like 650-700 kms in total during the day. There was only one single gas station on the way and it had awful reviews on Google (such as theft and deliberate punctures on tires) so we skipped that place fast. Luckily, we had a 25L jerry can in anticipation, so we just filled the tank and went on our way. So I suggest, every adventurer should have a jerry can in the trunk.\]

**- Aus:** We stayed for the night in Klein Aus Vista and had a very short walk before dark around the camping place. It was amazing. The open buffet at the restaurant was the best we had in Namibia and still it was pretty mediocre for an inflated price. Though the local beers are amazing, especially Hansa is quite delicious! In the morning, we went to watch the desert horses in Garub and have a breakfast. It was around 07:00 and there were absolutely no horses around. We started to boil some water and suddenly tens of horses appeared in the horizon. They were running and running real fast towards us. Within a few minutes, we were completely surrounded by them in the shelter. At first it was a dreamy experience. But then some of the horses started fighting among each other. They were quite aggressive and we couldn't get out of the shelter to reach our car. We had shout at them and convince them to give us a way but it was completely futile. A couple of them started kicking each other right next to our car and we were worried that they would destroy the bodywork. Luckily, nothing happened and as soon as I saw a clearance I ran to the car and we rapidly left the scene. That was tough! We were stuck in the shelter for maybe nearly half an hour?

**- Kolmanskop:** It has been a bucket list item for me since I was a teenager and after 25 years, I saw this place with my own eyes! I was super duper excited. It's just like it is in the photos. No need to explain. It took us a few hours to go around in a fastish pace. Personally, I would spend more time here but it got a bit boring for my partner so we proceeded to our next destination, Lüderitz, nice little town with not much to do. We stocked up in the supermarket, filled the tank and carried on to Shark Island and Diaz Point. Both are pretty uninteresting to be honest and not really worth investing the time.

**- The Flash Flood:** This paragraph here is not related to traveling so skip ahead if you don't want to hear about a driving experience but stay still if you think you might ever get caught in a flash flood. We were trying to reach Sesriem through the C13 road. We hadn't seen anyone on this section for the last hour or so. You rarely see anyone driving on C roads anyway. But we were completely alone, no possibility of help whatsoever. Still, it was a beautiful road and we were happy. At one point, we realized that it had started to rain but just a tiny little bit, barely noticeable, droplets would evaporate right after they landed on the windshield. It was 35C outside, scorching hot. But strangely, pretty much every hole on the road had turned into small puddles. We didn't care at all, at first. After a while the puddles started to get bigger, some turned into small mud baths, there was a little bit of water flowing but still our car was capable of overcoming all those things, pretty minor thing stuff for the 4x4. But after ten minutes or so, we came across a section of rolling hills and each depression had turned into small pools, each one deeper than the previous. We still carried on, until we were only 4-5 kms away from Helmeringhausen. At that point, the road had turned into a massive river! It was like 20 meter wide and absolutely impossible to pass with any land vehicle the human race has ever invented. We had seen a small amount of rain on the way but when we looked around, we saw cherry sized ice cubes, there was hail at this very spot, very recently. Although it completely ruined our plans for reaching Sesriem, we quickly realized we had to go back. So we jumped back in the car without loosing a minute. On the way back, all the small pools and puddles we had just crossed were twice, thrice the size. In just minutes of time, the water became a lot stronger. We realized that we could get stuck on the rolling hills, on top of a mound, between two pools of water. So pedal to the metal, we decided to speed up. Each pool we traversed was still larger than the previous one. Finally we came across another river passing over the road which didn't exist just fifteen minutes ago! The water seemed to be well over 50 cm high, maybe close to a meter, flowing rapidly. We were not sure we could pass but we decided to rely on the vehicle. We kissed each other with my partner, held hands for maybe the last time in case the car would flip and we would drown and get lost in the flash flood in a forgotten corner of this far away country. Of course, I am exaggerating our feelings but still, the situation seemed dire. We drove into the water. We were right in the middle of the depression and the car stalled momentarily. I thought we were stuck, the vehicle was sliding with the water, probably a couple of meters from where we should have been. I kept the gas steady and hoped for the best and suddenly it kicked again, taking us out at the other side. We survived. I am grateful to all the engineers at Nissan for designing this kickass vehicle. After this river, the situation got back to more manageable sized water pools and we carried on...

**- The Flat Tire:** Yet another driving experience so skip ahead if you wish. Since we couldn't proceed through C13, we had to find another way. But we had no internet or cell phone reception which we relied on for navigation. We would input our destination when we had connection and kept following it offline. Though, as soon as we hit a gravel road, we would go offline. So at this very point, we couldn't arrange an alternative road. We had to drive back for another hour until we reached some sort of civilization and mobile connection. Luckily, on our way we saw that we passed nearby a farm. So we decided to enter the farm and ask for help. We met a very nice old lady and she told us to use the D707 road as an alternative and pointed us towards its entrance. We followed her advice and hit the road. We were hoping to reach Betta before dark and stay in a lodge. Just 5-6 kms before Spes Bona, we realized that the car became a bit slower all of a sudden but there was no other issue. We stopped to check it out, it took us probably like a few hundred meters to came to a stop since there was no need for an emergency break. Well, the one of the rear tires was completely destroyed, like exploded and turned into shrapnel kind of destroyed. I turned my head towards a nearby hill and saw that the sun was just about to get lost behind it. It was like a Discovery Channel show. We had a very limited amount of time to change the tire, probably 20 minutes max. We threw everything out from the trunk, took out the spare and starting removing the exploded one. This was the first time ever we had changed a tire. But we did it right. I had watched some YouTube videos before we came, just in case this would happen. Well, it turned out to be handy! Right before the sunset, we were back in the car. Very tired, very dirty but mobile. We drove over an hour in darkness to reach the Kronenhof Lodge in Betta. It was a very stormy night with a lot of lightnings and we felt a bit on the edge after going through a flash flood, loosing a tire and driving pretty much all day long. Finally, we were safe. We were welcomed very very kindly at the lodge. They gave us a nice dinner and installed a brand new tire on our wheel while we had our breakfast in the next morning. We were back on the road before 08:00.

**- Sesriem:** We had planned to spend an entire day in the area but because of the hiccups of the previous day, we had to squeze everything into half a day. Unfortunately, we couldn't climb on top of every dune because of the time pressure but still we had plenty of time. Driving the 5 km long sand road near Sossusvlei area was a super fun experience. The dunes and clay pans are out of this world. We were hoping to see Deadvlei first thing in the morning with wonderful and dynamic shadows but we reached the place only in the afternoon. I assume our incredible experience would have been multiplied with the morning sun if we could make it on time. On the bright side, probably because of the heat, there was absolutely no one around and we had the entire area to ourselves for an hour or two. An absolute blast! This place alone is a reason to visit Namibia. Once we had our fair share of exposure for skin cancer, we proceed to other points of interest along the road and called it a day at the beautiful Desert Quiver Camp.

**- Solitaire:** We left Sesriem at sunset and reached Solitaire for the breakfast. C19 was a bit bumpier and uncomfortable than other C roads and we probably lost our front license plate on the way because of the vibrations? Yet another problem we have to solve on the way. Anyways, Solitaire is like a road stop sort of location with many abandoned old cars around, creating a nice photo opportunity. We had delicious and fresh meat pies and apple pies and coffee at the nice cafe and kept on going after an hour or so of rest. We took selfies at Tropic of Capricorn sign, crossed the treacherous thousand hills section of C14, crossed the Gaub and Kuiseb passes (which are sort of tricky if you are not driving slow) and finally arrived in Walvis Bay. First thing, we went to a repair shop to fix our license plate issue. Luckily, Indongo Toyota made a brand new one in just fifteen minutes and we were free to move on afterwards.

**- Walvis Bay:** There is not much to do in Walvis Bay either. The promenade is nice with many different birds to watch but other than that there isn't anything else to see. Therefore we opted for a 4x4 tour to the Sandwich Harbour. We weren't so sure of our driving skills to drive on the beach between massive sand dunes and super wavy ocean so we ended up in a private tour with iVenture and it turned out to be just fantastic! It took half a day to reach the harbour and get back, plus a game safari on the dunes and also a visit to the seals on the way back. I did ok but my partner was absolutely shaken because of the tough driving. Not that our driver had any fault, it's just the nature of driving over sand. If you are sensitive, make sure you have some motion sickness medicine before you start your day. Otherwise, it was quite the experience. We literally drove on waves because we were pushed out to the ocean by the impassable dunes. Just wow!

**- Swakopmund:** After we were done in Walvis Bay, we drove to Swakopmund, our favorite town in Namibia. It has a nice colonial center with many lively cafes and souvenir shops. Must stop for a few hours if it's on your way. Once we left the town, we ventured to the Moon Valley and had a nice short walk from viewvpoint no 4. Afterwars we had a coffee in lovely Goanikontes and turned back. I don't think this part of our trip was particularly interesting so you may entirely skip the Moon Valley section if you wish. We briefly visited the shipwreck of Zeila and proceeded towards Cape Cross.

**- Cape Cross:** This was a weird experience. As you drive closer to the beach, you start smelling some weird stuff and it just gets stronger and stronger. Once on the beach, it is nearly impossible to tolerate it. I was very very very close to vomiting all over the place. The seals naturally eat fish all their lives and just shit processed fish. Imagine that you are surrounded by ten thousands of them and try to materialize that smell. It was simply unbearable. We could only spend ten minutes admiring the (super noisy) animals and went back to as soon as possible. We couldn't talk or breath properly during that short amount of time. The stench stuck on our clothes and we couldn't get rid of it for two-three days from our vehicle. It is THAT terrible. But also amazing because there were so so so many seals around you. I'd recommend a visit but beware!

**- Spitzkoppe:** This place is simply awesome. We stayed for two nights, took a walking/driving tour inside the gated half and climbed on one of the peaks. We were extremely lucky to visit Namibia after a good rainy season which apparently comes every 10-15 years. So the entire country had some green in it, instead of the usual yellow scenery and the green suits Spitzkoppe very well! We found ourselves a lovely camping spot and enjoyed the stay very much.

**- Philip's Cave:** Next location, Philip's Cave. This place is located on private grounds, Ameib Ranch, a beautiful area where you can observe many animals like you are in a safari. The hike to the cave took over two hours to go and back and the route was a bit overgrown and not marked very well at junctions. In the end, you are rewarded with a great view and a nice cave with old tribal paintings. Make sure you have some water with you because you climb up and down. We also visited the Bull's Party and the local dam. It was a super nice day.

**- Etosha:** Just like the Sesriem area, Etosha is enough reason to visit Namibia. All sorts of animals venture freely in the massive park. It's like an open buffet safari. We had one and a half day in the park and we could visit all the waterholes between Okaukuejo and Namutoni and we stayed in Etosha Trading Post and Halali camps. Unfortunately for us, just in our first night, it rained a lot so the entire salt plain created thousands of natural water holes. Therefore the animals did not have to group around regular water holes to drink which meant we could see a lot less animals. What a bummer :( In the end, we still had our fair share of them including a HYENA (which is nocturnal so a great hit for us) and two lions. We drove over 400 kms inside the park, from sunrise to sunset. The road conditions are simply terrible with millions of potholes and sliding gravel. Most of the time, it is not possible to drive over 30 kms. Also because of the rain, there were many pooled or muddy areas which slowed us even further. Add to the fact, you cannot exit your vehicle because of predators so it was a rough experience to get stuck inside a hot vehicle for the entire day. Well, we survived and saw many amazing animals. I especially loved the zebras because they don't mind your existence at all. We really wanted to see the rhinos as well but couldn't find them anywhere.

**- Waterberg:** Luckily, we had a rhino tracking tour in Waterberg Wilderness, a private reserve. We took off early in the morning with a guide and walked for a few hours up to the rhino territory. We got to see all seven of them which lives in the park and a child rhino approached me until there was only a single meter between us. It was the most magical experience I had with an animal. Curious little one wanted to smell my camera :) We stayed the night in the reserve and made a hike inside the valley. Unfortunately the path was not marked well at all and it was completely overgrown. We had a little bit of trouble finding our way in the end section. At one point, the vegetation could reach our chests and it was a marshy area with no visible path, other than some signs we saw every so often. We were worried that we would be bitten by snakes but made out alive without any hiccups. After that experience, we cut our hikes and decided not to walk the other sections. That was a big bummer because it was so beautiful around. We complained at the reception and they said they'll try to fix it. I mean, I understand. It was a rainy season with almost no visitors and they couldn't catch up with the trimming of paths. Still, it turned out to be dangerous and we are very experienced hikers, regular people could just get lost.

**- Conclusion:** In the end, we loved Namibia so much that we dreamed about building a small farm and living there for our retirement. All the people we met were extremely kind and we felt very welcome. It was an orderly and clean country. We saw no garbage, plastic bags or any kind pollution around us. Even the public toilets were really clean. We drove through some areas which were hit with deep poverty, people living in tin huts, walking for kilometers to who knows where and all sorts of issues that you may imagine. But still, they were nice people. Never had anyone approach us with ill intentions or harassment and that is rare in the life of travelling! I would whole heartly recommend everyone to see this amazing place if you are able to. It's an adventure but well worth it!

**Chapter 1: Train-kun and The Void**

Vector, rubbing his temples, groaned in frustration as he stared at his laptop screen. Another late night another battle with his research paper as prepares for his upcoming presentation.

""Just one more section…"" he told himself, stretching his sore shoulders.

One more paragraph he would be done… After 3 minutes he typed the last words. 

“fuhh… finally completed it.”

He is working on a research paper, a detailed analysis on ‘historical developments of the human society from palaeolithic era to information era’, was finally ready for his upcoming conference. 

Vector’s presentation was scheduled to take place in a conference in another state, which he could reach there by a day-and-a-half train journey.

As a university student, he had dedicated months working on the research paper.

Leaning back, he reached for his phone and quickly booked a train ticket and he was fortunate that he had booked the ticket.

With the festive season approaching, tickets were in high demand and often unavailable. 

Why not Flight? Because by going with the Train he is saving money.

Then, Vector headed to the university canteen to grab something to eat.

….

A week passed in the blink of an eye. 

During this time, he streamlined his research paper for his upcoming conference and continued his daily normal student life.

And the day of his train journey finally came.

On the departure day, he packed his bags, ensuring everything was in order for the upcoming train journey.  
Vector started preparation to catch his train. So, he decided to leave the hostel 1 Hour before to catch the train. He needed 15 minutes to reach the station from his university and the extra time to deal with any issues if it happened. 

Vector stepped out of his university hostel. The university’s air filled with fresh air because of the abundance of the trees and absence of the motor vehicles.

He took a deep breath, adjusting the straps of his backpack before pulling out his phone. With a few taps, he booked a Taxi ride.

As he waited for the taxi, his eyes gazed towards the university hostel. This place had been his home for years. 

His parents had died in a car accident when he was just nine. It wasn’t that he was destitute, he had savings and insurance money. 

But the absence of his parents also affected him as he saw the other students' parents supporting them; these created an emptiness in his heart, and nothing could soothe it.

Life had never been easy, going through his teenage years, struggling to pass hard-time in life while also going with his studies. There were nights when he doubted if there was any meaning in his existence.  
And yet, here he was, strong and unyielding.

As he was thinking of his life… A car approached him, where he was standing.

The faint horn of a car snapped him from his thoughts. A yellow taxi pulled up, the taxi driver rolling down the window.

""Vector?""

""Yeah, that’s me,"" he confirmed, slipping into the backseat. 

After the confirmation, the car started to move. The car moved towards the university Exit Gate, then eased into the flow of restless traffic.

Vector leaned back on the back seat, gazing out of the window as the city’s scenery appeared before him. On the market street, vendors shouted over one another, colorful lights flickered on the carts, friends laughed at roadside eateries and the scent of street food drifted through the air… Motorbikes moving between cars with reckless ease.

A small smile formed on his lips. No matter how he struggled and hardship suffered, this city had tempered him and gave him hope for life. Every hardship, every lonely night had forged the person he was today.  
As the car drives toward the railway station, Vector watches the moment outside the window, as the city bustles with energy.

Eventually, the car arrived at the railway station. After passing through a security check, Vector entered the station.

Vector stood on the bustling railway platform, a scene all too familiar during festival season. 

The station filled with the gentle bustle of travelers, the clinking of coffee cups at nearby kiosks, and the crisp tones of announcements echoing through the platform, as he admired the trains passing on the other platforms, one of humanity’s most remarkable innovations in transport.

He pulled out his phone and checked the time, his train was arriving soon.

As the distant hum of the arriving train grew louder, passengers gathered calmly near their designated boarding areas. There was a quiet sense of anticipation on the platform, with travelers checking schedules and adjusting their luggage, just the usual buzz of a busy station.

But just then, a burst of commotion erupted behind Vector, shattering the calm. 

Vector didn’t even have time to process what was happening when,...out of nowhere, someone shoved Vector towards the railway tracks,....straight into the path of the upcoming train. 

Before he could react, he felt a strong impact slammed into him from the unstoppable train engine and then, arrived the Train-kun’s Divine Judgement. **{yes, I will not use Truck-kun’s divine power.(¬‿¬)}**

Time slowed, his breath caught. 



AAAhhhh…, am I going to die? 



In that final moment, flashes of his life surged through his mind, memories, faces, laughter, tears, slipping by like an image in his mind. Passing one image after another in his mind. 

But as he was going through this a strange phenomenon happened. 

In that split second.



A crack in space tore open.



From it emerged a vortex, swirling with black and a mix of colors that shimmered like polar auroras. It expanded violently, pulling Vector’s very soul into the void, then disappeared as if it was never there.

Vector drifted in the void, and felt darkness all around him like an endless and infinite void. Yet within it lies countless galaxies and stars.

These galaxies come in diverse forms: spiral, elliptical, and irregular, each containing billions of stars, and stars which are expanding continuously in a circular mass body most likely it is the universe. Appears to be always moving away from each other.

Darkness and silence prevailed in the void. On a larger scale, the galaxies would trace out a ""cosmic web"", a network of filaments and voids, resembling a giant spider-web. This structure reveals the underlying distribution of dark matter, which shapes the universe.

The ever expanding universe seems to be driven by a dark energy, which is present all over the void.

Vector floated in an endless void, as his thoughts rapidly thinking what's happening here **(o\_O)**, is he in a dream. 

Because of his arrival the ethereal, yet dark and silent, and boundless void is disturbed.

His thought process suddenly stopped as he felt a surge of energy rushing  in him.

A primordial, boundless, and mysterious energy surged in his soul. The pain was unbearable, searing through every fiber of his being, threatening to unravel him entirely. But as time lost meaning, the pain gradually faded away.

The power didn’t destroy him, it reshaped him.

It sharpened his mind, enhanced his thoughts, as if his brain had been replaced with a supercomputer. The energy flowed through him like a second heartbeat, etching something into the very structure of his soul.

This force flows gently through his soul, permeating every part of his being, gradually reshaping and rewriting his very essence.

As the time passed indefinitely…, and

Eventually, a new vortex formed beside him and a gravitational force pulled his soul once again. His soul was pulled once more, through space and time vortex, and transferred into an unknown land.

Once again darkness and silence prevailed in the void… but this ethereal and boundless void contains a power which is unimaginable.

In a distant universe, on a planet shrouded in mystery, a vortex shimmered above a lifeless body. The figure had a wound in his chest, the kind only a blade could make. He seemed dead… but not quite.

The vortex opened fully, and Vector’s soul descended into the body and merged with the lifeless body.  
And as suddenly as it had appeared, the space closed. Silent once more. As if nothing had ever happened.

  
========================================================  
Author’s Note:

**What is the term Train-kun?** If you’re not familiar with it, don’t worry! If you’ve read isekai stories, you might already know where this is going… if not then don’t worry I am here to tell you… In many isekai novels, the protagonist gets transported to another world after an accident, usually involving a truck. That’s where the meme Truck-kun comes from, often jokingly referred to as the agent of “divine judgment.”

**So, Train-kun?**

Well, it’s just a fun twist on that classic isekai trope. Stick around, you might just enjoy this ride like it’s another life you’re living… though don’t worry, it’s all safely within the novel.
