I cry myself to sleep every night, and that’s usually not until about 4am. Every day I feel more and more afraid of how I feel. Like I can’t crawl out this time. My entire life. Just poof, gone. I’m hurting so bad and I just lay in my bed on my phone doom scrolling all day because I can’t get up. Everyone has their own problems, I can’t burden anyone with my pain so I just keep it in. Im financially in a hole now being on my own and trying to survive, I can’t even afford food. I wish more than anything this was all just a bad dream and I will wake up and I’ll have my coffee started for me and his chest to lay my head. He was my family. My family is broken and he became mine. I don’t want to hurt anymore. I want to feel joy again, I need hope again.

Long story short, my vehicle broke down on the 401 near Chatham on our way to Windsor on Friday night and because CAA wouldn’t tow us any father then the Chatham Canadian Tire parking lot, it’s stuck there at least until Monday when they open. We managed to find a ride through poparide from Chatham to Windsor on Saturday but come Sunday because all buses and trains are booked and no rental cars available, we’re stuck too! We don’t have a lot of friends or family to reach out to but we continue to check poparide every couple of hours so fingers crossed for that. 
There’s 2 of us and we can leave Windsor anytime after 1:30pm. We don’t have a lot of money but can help with gas and cover coffees and supper. I can even do the driving if needed. We’re both smokers but don’t mind if we can’t, we can wait for pee stops! We also have a bit of luggage so we’d need a bit of room in your trunk for that. 
Please let me know if you can help us get home or as close to home as possible. Also, if you have any other ideas for us to explore, that’d be appreciated as well. 
Thanks in advance.

I did pay once for our coffee. And when I give him gifts, I make sure to make an extra effort. Which he genuinely likes.

As most people here have probably already heard, Kindle is [removing the ability to download Kindle books](https://www.theverge.com/news/612898/amazon-removing-kindle-book-download-transfer-usb) to your computer on February 26th. This has prompted some to download their libraries ahead of the shut-off. This is allowed/supported on the Amazon website, but it's an annoying process for people with large libraries because each title must be downloaded manually via a series of button clicks.

For anybody interested in downloading their library more easily, I've written a browser script that simulates all those button clicks for you. If you already have TamperMonkey installed in your browser it can be installed [with a single click](https://github.com/Make-Fun-Stuff/kindle-library-downloader/raw/refs/heads/main/kindle-library-downloader.user.js), but full instructions on how to install and use it [can be found here](https://github.com/Make-Fun-Stuff/kindle-library-downloader), alongside [the actual code](https://github.com/Make-Fun-Stuff/kindle-library-downloader/blob/main/kindle-library-downloader.user.js) for anybody interested.

The script does not do anything sketchy or violating any Amazon policies, it's literally just clicking all the dropdowns/buttons/etc. that you'd have to click if you were downloading everything by hand.

If you have any questions or run into any issues, let me know! I've tested this in Chrome on both Mac and Windows, but there's always a chance of a bug somewhere.

**Piracy Note:** This is not piracy, nor is it encouraging piracy. This is merely a way to take advantage of an official Kindle feature before it's turned off.

tl;dr: Script install link is [here](https://github.com/Make-Fun-Stuff/kindle-library-downloader/raw/refs/heads/main/kindle-library-downloader.user.js), instructions are [here.](https://github.com/Make-Fun-Stuff/kindle-library-downloader)

1iw50m7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adelaide/comments/1iw50m7/touring_comics_recommendations_of_adelaide_fringe/,Touring Comics Recommendations Of Adelaide Fringe Shows To See,"Hey Adelaide People,



Big fan of the Fringe, definitely deserves the mantle of biggest event in the country and props to you because it's something South Australia does better than anyone. 

I'm from WA and I can only dream that Perth Fringe got the kind of support you give yours but unfortunately, Gina needed another pool..

I know there's a million shows and last fest people found this list helpful. So for anyone unsure on what to see, here's some great acts to checkout this year.

I've limited it to Australian-based comics doing new solo shows who I've personally gigged with and aren't big names on TV doing ""trial shows"" for a full-price ticket before they bring it to Smellbourne.



Amy Hetherington - unbelievably endearing, relateable and funny, best thing to come out of Darwin since the theory of evolution. Medium crowdwork definitely not an insult comic but rather the fun mum, charming best friend and goofball all in one.

Dane Simpson - such an inviting comic that really works to make everyone feel welcome and part of something. You really feel like you know every one of the characters when he's on for a yarn and by the end appreciate them just as much as him. Hilarious and genuine, medium crowdwork but you know from the get go he wants everyone having their best night possible.

Josh Glanc - this is solo character sketch/music comedy that is by silly gooses for silly gooses. Takes grounded experiences we all know to the maximum absurdity. Medium crowdwork/audience participation but feels like a one man party he just started coupled with the chest hair of a Greek prince.

David Callan - such a chill stage presence you never expect the jokes because it feels so effortlessly conversational. Medium to heavy crowdwork that feels like he genuinely wants to know more about you and he probably does. Can make a crowd of 10 feel at home just as easily as 100.

Elouise Eftos - this is an insane show. It's clearly just a platform for her to show everything she can do and she absolutely nails it. Great standup, improv, crowd work, sketches, dance, singing and a stage presence that is hilariously self-referential but also such a great character. This show particularly is all about the expectations placed on women in society and the hate they receive when they try to deliver on it. If you're all about boss pussy vibes and getting behind one another, this is it.

David Rose - I really like David for how much you can tell he loves comedy. Everything about his set is working to make each joke land as well as it can. Can make a punchline about buying a coffee land just as easily as one about Gaza and how much the \*redacted for the ABC\* are absolutely destroying the people of \*redacted for the ABC\*. Medium amount of crowd work very solid and consistent.

Gill Cordiner - I'm lucky to have a bunch of comedy mums and Gill's one of my favourites. She's become such a weapon on stage, heavy crowdwork that feels like you have a new favourite wild aunt coupled with strong material honed from being a great work ethic.

Luke Heggie - honestly, probably zero crowdwork because he just doesn't need it. I have never seen a blend of low energy stage presence and a joke rate of a submachine gun. If you go see Heggie you can just laugh whenever you want because the odds are he's just gotten another joke in. Mundane relateable things for all that are eviscerated to their maximum with incredibly clever writing.

Rudy Lee Taurua - this man is a comedy enigma, 6""7 and covered in tatts like he just got out of life without parole but is just a phenomenaly decent human. Great material through a really unique lens from his upbringing and cultural influences. Feels like your cool older brother is talking the funniest shit in front of all your friends and you don't want him to stop.

Aiden Jones - has the most infectious laugh and such a good engaging storyteller. Doing a new show all about Chopin's Nocturn after teaching himself piano. Really interesting and unique take that deconstructs music in a way I haven't seen anyone do, let alone comedically. He loves to engage with the crowd but makes it all about connection and fostering something good for all.

Daniel Muggleton - an absolute pro, it's a new hour so if you've seen him before check it out. medium crowd work and has a great knack for working premises in ways we never think of and ties it in with some really clever writing that doesn't make you feel dumb. Can make a bit look like it's off the top of his head and you will never know if it was but just another reason he's great.

Andrew Hanson - I know I said no one from TV but I met his a while back and he was just so genuinely nice and took alot of time out of his day to chat with me which can be a real rarity with more established names. He's doing a great new show of standup, characters and song that is somehow not selling out so checkout the limited run when you can. 

Jeromiah Detto - full disclosure I am bromantically invested in this beautiful Italian boy, he's such a gem. This is a clowning show so heavy crowdwork as it drives the improv but you'll get a new show each night and you'll leave the show wanting a photo of him in your wallet like you're his Nonna.

Luke Benson - great UK act based in Melbourne who's over for a new hour. Relaxed delivery feels like you can go at your own pace and just let the jokes come to you. A decent amount of crowdwork but he really works to make it more interesting than asking them what their job is and just punching down.

Joe White - such a straight over the plate good comic, medium to heavy crowdwork but he's just a lovely guy it feels so sincere and nice. Great blend of his unique upbringing as a refugee mixed with such great Australian takes he's such a treat

Mickey D - I will never stop saying this, Mickey is the best comedy MC/host in the country. Insanely quick-witted, great material, super affable. He builds up a crowd like no one else so get behind the Adelaide comedy GOAT.

Other shoutouts of good acts but I haven't seen their shows yet, Nikki Valentine, Surenne Jayemen, Ethan Cavanough, Mick Neven, Amos Gill, Nick Capper, Peter James, Lou Wall, Lewis Garnham, Anisa Nandaula

And for anyone who wants to come to mine, I've got the South Australian premiere of my new show ""Maybe He's Born With It, Maybe It's ADHD"". Just came off the back of a second sellout season at Perth fringe, Melbourne Fringe and Perth Comedy Festival. Not just for people on the specky, would love to have you and a few nights already soldout so hopefully see you there.

1iw4uwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1iw4uwe/cranberry_tablets_have_helped_heal_my_gut/,Cranberry Tablets have helped heal my gut,"This is my story of where I am on my histamine intolerance and health journey and how finding cranberry tablets have fixed a lot of my gut issues and have given me some light at the end of the tunnel.

By the way, sorry if this post is rambling.  Its taken me over an hour to write as I didn’t keep a journal of what I did when so it might come across as a bit jumbled!

So straight off the top, taking cranberry tablets for 2 weeks now have had a MASSIVE impact on my gut health.  I feel so much better now after only 2 weeks of supplementation but let me back up a bit to give you all an idea of where I was and still am…

This post is a bit sprawling and all over the place and I apolgise for that.

So like a lot of you, my symptoms got worse around COVID time.  So I have been dealing with these histamine/gut/health related issues for 3 years and they have ravaged me. Constant scratching of my skin has left it in tatters, a burning hot body, flushes, taking anti-histamines but then realising taking too many is also an issue, having to give up coffee, tea etc.  Reacting to pretty much everything you eat. The list goes on. 

**Salt**

Now, before I get onto the cranberry, I want to make a quick detour and talk about salt.  So about a month ago, I was dealing with a lot of hot internal heat in my body. It felt like my body was on fire.  It was like a volcano inside of me which I couldn’t extinguish. Sleeping at night was a killer. I made sure I kept to my low histamine diet and was drinking lots of water but my symptoms was getting worse. Then one day I ate a big bag of salted nachos from Tescos and I instantly started to feel calmer and my body wasn’t on fire.. I put two and two together and realised I was salt deficient. So I just wanted to mention that here that we need to make sure our electrolytes are in balance.  Now sometime around 2023 I brought some electrolyte powder and it made my symptoms worse so I never tried it again. But this time I did some more research and I ended up buying a bag of celtic salt and I now put a couple of granules on my tongue in the morning and afternoon.  Nothing crazy because too much salt is also bad.. But I just pick out a tiny small pinch of salt granules and suck on them in my tongue and they dissolve. If your going to do this, please don’t buy plain table salt.  That stuff is literally just pure sodium (extracted salt). Instead, buy celtic salt, pink Himalayan salt or even sea salt and it will contain big clumps of rocks and they contain lots of different nutrients like sodium but also magnesium and potassium.  So I just wanted to mention that here because I am also doing that every day now.  I want to mention it so you get a picture of what I am doing.

**Vitamin C / Vitamin B**

Just to mention it here, I am still also taking my weekly 1/2 teaspoon of vitamin C powder (sodium ascorbate) every Monday as well as my Vitamin B complex tablet..

**Cranberry Extract Tablets**

Now onto the cranberry story.   So about a year ago, I read up that Cranberry is supposed to be really good for your gut and health and provides lots of benefits so I went out and brought some cranberry juice but it was too sweet and it didn’t agree with me.  It flared me up so I gave up on it and threw it away…

It’s weird because if you look at low histamine diet lists like the SIGHI list, cranberries are down as low histamine and “well tolerated”.  At the time, I didn’t read this list but it says, and I quote: ""Dried cranberries are generally considered safe and well-tolerated by most individuals, including those with histamine intolerance."" – That’s the key.  Dried cranberry, not the drinks where they add loads of sugars and what-not.  I didn’t realise you could get cranberry extract in powder form and tablets.

But then a couple of weeks ago I saw a post on the long covid boards where a guy started taking cranberry tablets instead of the juice and was having good results so I did some more research and that’s when I found the SIGHI list notes mentioned above and decided to do the same thing.

This is what I did.

I brought these cranberry tablets but there is lots of different suppliers and powders out there: [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vitabiotics-Ultra-Cranberry-30-Tablets/dp/B007RM9JRE](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vitabiotics-Ultra-Cranberry-30-Tablets/dp/B007RM9JRE)

Each one of my tablets is 750mg just so you get a feel for my dosage.

**Week 1**

For the first few days, I used my pestle and mortar [https://www.amazon.co.uk/mortar-pestle/s?k=mortar+and+pestle](https://www.amazon.co.uk/mortar-pestle/s?k=mortar+and+pestle) to crush the tablets into a fine dust and then had ¼ of a teaspoon every day.  I wanted to introduce this into my bodly slowly. By the end of the week I was upto ½ a teaspoon with no adverse reactions.  Even if I did have reactions I said to myself I was going to push through but I had none.  How I was having it was by drinking it with cold water.

**Week 2**

By the beginning of the 2^(nd) week, I went all in and decided to have a whole tablet. I crushed it all and I decided to put it in a cup of hot water and it was like having one of those flavoured teas!! I loved this as It was like having my teas again as up to this point for 3 years ive only been having hot water as my cup of tea!.  I was okay with the dose. Over the next few days I worked up to having 3 cups of tea a day each with 1 crushed tablet in.  One in the morning, one for dinner and one for bed.  That’s 3 crushed tablets per day (750mg \* 3). 

By the way, I know what your thinking and your right..  At this point I guess I could have just swallowed the tablet whole but I was enjoying crushing them up and having them as a tea.

Then over the last few days, buoyed on by my results I have been taking my drinks with 2 tablets crushed up in them each.  So that’s 750mg \* 6 per day, but that’s probably too much as the packet recommend just 2 tablets per day so I am now going to reduce back to 2 tablets per day.

**Results**

This is where I started to see massive results.  Honestly, over the last 3 years I have tied everything but nothing has affected me more positively than supplementing with cranberry.  Now I feel like my gut is more at ease.  My skin is starting to look better and not a red underglow! For some reason, before, even fasting would not agree with me.  It like the bad bacteria in my gut would get angry. On Thursday this week, I skipped breakfast for the first time in a long time.  I am taking little to no antihistamines.  I am sleeping better.  I can see a light at the end of the tunnel.  In terms of my symptoms I feel much better. Now am I fully cured? No..  But this is a stepping stone for sure.  I plan on continuing to supplement with cranberry tablets for the next 3 to 6 months to see what happens.

**My Diet**

I wanted to also mention my diet here..  Like I said, I am still on a very restrictive diet. I basically eat porridge for breakfast with oat milk, and potatoes with chicken and salad for lunch and tea.  That pretty much it but I eat the potato because its supposed to be good for your gut as it produces resistant starch.   

I am still trying to figure out what my next steps are to continue healing myself.  Like everyone says, it takes a holistic approach. (holistic meaning all encompassing)

**Cranberry Research & Facts**

So, after I started taking cranberry and finding out it was helping, I started doing research on them.  When I did, I was amazed at how good they are for you.. If you do some Google research yourself, you will find that cranberry has got all the Anti's...... 

Its Antimicrobial, Its Antibacterial, its Antiviral, its Anti-inflammatory and its got Antioxidants in it.

The main antioxidant in cranberries is Quercetin. We all know how important that is here. Quercetin helps inhibit and reduce the release of histamine in the body!! 

In addiditon to this, cranberry are good for helping your Bifidobacteria in your gut. Type it into Google and have a look.  There was a study done and reported that said “in the present study, *Bifidobacterium was significantly increased with the cranberry extract* providing low amounts of (poly)phenols”.

There was also a study that also revealed that the cranberry extract increased butyrate production, an SCFA (short chained fatty acid) with potent health benefits.

And then, on top of all that Cranberry is a rich source of polyphenols including flavan-3-ols, anthocyanins, and flavonols. It’s the polyphenols which give the cranberry their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. They may help protect against chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.  

Here are some links:

[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4942875/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4942875/)  


**Before I go**

So, I just wanted to share my story just in case it helps anyone else.  Remember, if your going to try anything yourself, listen to your body and do your own research.    Like I say, I don’t think I am fully fixed yet but this is the first time in 3 years I have started to really feel better.  Ive done all the vitamin c, the vitamin b’s, the DOA…  All that and I never really felt like I was fixing my root cause which is issues in my gut. Taking cranberry extract every day for the last 2 weeks in combination with everything else I have mentioned has really helped.  It’s a massive stepping stone for me for but now I need to look for the next stepping stone.

1iw4uin,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1iw4uin/girl_asked_for_my_number/,Girl asked for my number,"Look I’m as surprised as you.
Here’s how it went:
I was at work clearing tables and giving people drinks. Passed by this table and the girl kinda went shy next time I went over there here friends said do it. 
She asked for my number.
I kinda push her off at first because I had a manager near me and we have a policy about giving out numbers so I responded with “I don’t know how I feel about giving out my number at work”
This girl is really pretty so I wasn’t about to give up the chance to maybe have a relationship with her.
So I went to the back wrote my number on a sheet of paper from the food printer paper. Later when I was passing I put it on the table

Later that night I get home and receive a call first time I did pick up completely forgetting I gave out my number it called a second time and I remembered oh yeah I gave out my number today so I answered. 
Girl I still don’t know her name (she won’t give it to me) so I named her trip you’ll find out why here soon.. 

Picking up the phone I say “hi?” 
Trip “do you know who this is”
Me: “girl I gave my number to at work?”
Trip: “ yep that’s me.. so when we going on our first date? Where you taking me” 
Me: (so I’m thinking It’s a first date) I was thinking we could go bowling or to a coffee shop
Trip: “ok trick sure let’s go bowling can my friends come”
Me: “no first dates aren’t really a group thing I ain’t about to go on a double date when It’s our first date”
Trip: “why not it’d be fun. Ok trick I see you”
Me: “trick don’t think I’ve ever had that name before”

(Had to look it up maybe I’m reading too much into this but here’s what it means “In slang, ""trick"" for a guy usually refers to a sexual act, particularly when used in the context of a sex worker, meaning a single instance of paid sexual activity; essentially, ""turning a trick"" means engaging in a sex act for money”)

So here’s kinda where I got trip because p switches for ck meaning female or something like that..

Trip: “ok trick we’ll talk later you better text me tomorrow”

I wake up thinking I don’t even know this girls name I don’t want to have sex with her I’m still a virgin planned on being that way til marriage so I sent her this (paragraph warning)


So.. I was thinking and I don’t know your name, tell me a little about yourself. To make it easier I can start.
Hi, I’m Brycen I’m a college student going for a biology degree at (name of college). I’m (my age), have three siblings am the second born of the four. I’m a glorified geek in my own right. In my free time I play video games bowl and read books. Main games I play are Minecraft, rivals, diablo 4 and helldivers. I’m currently reading forever song. 

I like to have fun but also keep things balanced—I budget what I make, but I’m not living paycheck to paycheck

One thing you should probably know about me is I tend to tell you the truth right out. I’m a communication guy if I feel like somethings wrong I’ll communicate it, and I appreciate when people are upfront with me too. It makes things easier

What’s some things you think I should know about you?


She responds after the whole day didn’t even respond to my message saying 
“I like girls and boys so I’m up for a 3 some 👀 With 2 girls tho 🥹👅,

At this point I have a feeling that we ain’t going on a date she wants me to pay her for sex with her so here’s my response a tad aggressive but I feel like it needed to be 

“So you’re going to ignore my first text?
Why do you only text me at like 2 am?
What part of me telling you I didn’t want that from you.
I want to get to know you I want to date you. I don’t wanna be a one night stand for you to cross off your check list of taking a guys V card 

Does a threesome sound awesome yes but I’m not looking for that at-least not til we’re married and even then I still kinda frown it I wouldn’t want another guy in the room why would you want another girl?
Also still don’t know your name..

I’m giving her one more message if she even messages then I plan on sending this if it has anything do with sex or me paying her etc..

“Right now you have not given me any reason to want to take you on a date.
If I wanted booty I know plenty of hoes.

My long-term goal is to finish all five Italian levels and eventually get a B2 certification. Luckily, my upper-intermediate French helps a lot!  

However, I have a trip in six months to East Africa—Kilimanjaro, safari, Zanzibar—so I decided to pick up Swahili to make the most of my experience (and because it just seems fun). Now I’m trying to figure out a strategy to balance both languages effectively.  

Doing two Pimsleur lessons a day, one for each language, is technically possible but feels unsustainable — consistency is king.  

### My Current Plan:  
- **Pause Italian Pimsleur** (for now)  
- **Focus on Swahili** – One Pimsleur lesson per day  
- **Anki Flashcards** – Keep reviewing both Italian and Swahili (vocab + sentences)  
- **Passive Italian Exposure** – Listen to Coffee Break Italian instead of Pimsleur, since it’s lighter  

### After Finishing Pimsleur Swahili (only one unit exists):  
- Resume Italian Pimsleur  
- Continue both Anki decks  

### Before My Trip:  
- Pause Italian again  
- Review the last ~10 Swahili lessons  

### After the Trip:  
- Finish the Italian course  
- Get an Italian tutor  
- Work toward the B2 certification

1iw4qt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1iw4qt8/fighting_conformity/,Fighting conformity.,"Hello everyone, i need to share with the group, bare with me. I've been sitting on my bed , looking at the wall, ruminating for hours now (classic, am I right?). I am upsetting myself more and more thinking about all the times I've been judged for not conforming to ideas and things people insist I do (or be). I'd like to hear from you if you've had the same frustrations, and how deeply you've been affected by it. I've developed some deep seeded anger and triggers about it.. For reference, I grew up in 80s/90s.

I was very upset today becasue I'm so frustrated with why couldn't/can't  people let me be myself. Or respect boundries ive estabished for my well being. So upset i felt i should eliminate myself becasue it will never be okay to be myself. Sometimes it feels like everyone has hated who I really am, that every person has tried to push me down. Make me less.  I know it is not everyone, though i feel i will eventually run off anyone who gets close enough to get to know me. What really was SO wrong with me being a little different or odd as a child? That unbearable to let me be me? Ive had this hyper vigilance drilled into me to always be concerned about what others will think of me.  As an adult who has lived on their own and taken care of themselves and all the bills and all the adult shit that comes with life. Why I am still feeling judged for being myself and living how I want? Why does it matter? Why can't I live authentically? I would never impose myself on others the way it has been done to me. I would never disrespect others boundries the way mine are constantly.

Looking back I've always been a little contrarian. Having to put my own special spin on whatever I did. Almost like I worked on being different. But I think it was mostly to stimulate my brain. I want new ideas, and  thought experiments. I make a little game in my head of most things I do. Switch up ideas and things (some chaos, if you will?) I don't want to do something ""just becasue its the way it is"". I'm never bored, everything is fun in here most of the time. House gets messy, but then I have a fun day of tag teaming cleaning and gaming. And then it feels nice being all tidy and accomplished. I don't force myself to do routine things, it gets done ""when the spirit moves me"", is what I say. I've learned to work with my neurodivergent brain instead of against it. 

 Alot of this is resentment for my mother and aunts and that whole generation for parroting phrases and ideas which ""just are"". I could list so many things. That as I grew up i just didn't see why, or was fun to mix it up and do another way. I chose a stone caveman to sleep with instead of a teddy bear. I wanted the airplane model I was painting to be purple with stars not blue. Why do my earings have to match? Why do i need to put my bed against the wall, its fun to move it to the middle of the room and constantly roll over it to get to other side.  Always told, stop it, be quiet, just do it like everyone does, what will others think of you? . I don't see why i couldn't be allowed to be me without judgement and remarks...and insults. Why being me is always a fight.

Things as silly as, supper is at 5oclock on the dot, everyday. I dont have to obide by this arbitrary rule. If I'm not hungry then, I don't have to eat. If the kids come home and had a big after school snack(meal), they are fine until later in evening. Then they won't be hungry again before bed anyway. This always made sense and worked for me and kids are fed and perfectly fine. But my mother would call and comment that the kids need to be eating now, it's supper time. Or ask them if they had supper yet? Like fuck, they eat/ate, what does it matter if it's according to your schedule. Let's not touch ""breakfast is the most important meal of the day"".

She would constantly come into my house and ""just have to"" do things like wash my dishes (never done well, had to rewash anyway), or pick stuff up around the house and pile it on my coffee or kitchen table. Thanks, a clutter pile in my work space. I started throwing stuff back on the floor if she put it on my tables. No one asked you to ""clean"" my place. Or fold my hoodies and throw blankets i left on my couch. I want them where I put them, now they are folded and i can't  grab em. She was never going to stop imposing her dumb standards on me and crossing my boundries, we are no contact now.

My anger at having to fight constantly for myself and being misunderstood is dragging me down. I should be able to move on with my life now that I understand I have adhd. Things clicked, I felt relief in understanding myself, but then the anger started. Why can I not be me? Why is it so hard to let a person be themselves? Why is it so hard to love someone like me? I'm really funny and love comedy and humor. I love learning and talking to people about real stuff and learning about them. I get excited and interrupt or get loud, but it's not in malice. I cry a lot because I care so much about everything and it hurts me. I am on medication now that helps immensely with meltdowns and emotional regulation. Everything should be getting better but the anger and guilt and self hate are hard to get over. And i dont want to damage the good relationships i have now. 

I live in a very small town, it is an awful place. I feel ive been put in a cage, and because I'm angry I'm in a cage and fight to get out is proof I am the crazy one who needs to be in a cage. I'm leaving this place soon, I hope I can move on and be happy and get better. I don't ever want to come back here figuratively or litterally. ",1,1740295787.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
1iw4qqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1iw4qqm/aitah_for_moving_out_with_little_notice/,Aitah for moving out with little notice?,"This is a burner account for obvious reasons. Here’s some back story bc context matters- 

6 years ago I (39f) was in an abusive relationship which I narrowly escaped but was being actively stalked. My son who was 7 at the time and I needed a safe place. My mom nearing who is 65 now was a bartender. She was supporting my brother who is 32 and my sister who was a teenager at the time but is now 22. She was living in an apartment, wanted to get into a house, split the bills, and have a knee surgery she had been putting off. I agreed. 

Two years went by, with no surgery. I met a dude had a serious thing, her friend had a big giant house he wanted to rent to us. We could afford it. We got that house together. Once we all moved in my bf at the time was like… I don’t think your mom likes me. I try to talk to her and she snubs me. She would be like… I wish your bf would talk to me. Why doesn’t he like us. Having no frame of reference here … I was like… maybe I don’t know this dude like I thought I did and he’s trying to divide my family. She successfully created a division in our relationship, we broke up. He moved out. She was working part time and I was paying all of the billls. 

3 years ago,  I sat my family down, told my brother and mother I don’t want to be doing this when I’m 40. Things need to get moving. She had a surgery she needed, applied for disability but not yet approved . Brother still not working. Covid hit, I got really sick. Like really sick. It triggered an autoimmune response that made me pretty much bed ridden for 2 years. I already worked from home. They would literally check to make sure I was awake during my work day so I wouldn’t get fired when no one had jobs and no one was working but me. 

Two years ago my son’s brother needed a place to stay. He was 18, had a job. My mom was a grandmother to him. But he started to say… I don’t think she likes me. I keep trying to talk to her and she is kind of mean or won’t even look at me. I sat her down. It wasn’t the first time I had heard it. I told her that he’s like my kid and if I had to I would leave with my kids. She’s not allowed to treat my family poorly bc her peace is disturbed. Or she can hear them in the house. She has the whole upstairs with primary suite while I live in the finished basement. And still pay for everything. He eventually moved on but this was a huge disagreement my mother and I had between us and I told her I wouldn’t forgive her if she did this again. 

Last year i got my health back due to new medication. Started to date again. Got a boyfriend. I DID do an asshole thing and when his landlord sold his place and he was looking for a house I offered for him to stay for a while. Told my mom at lunch but didn’t really ask permission since I pay all the fucking bills. Every dime of my money goes to housing joblessness people, their internet, car insurance , entertainment, utilities that cost just as much as the rent so they can sit by the pool with their friends while I sit in the basement on my laptop. Working. So no I didn’t ask her permission. It wasn’t an asshole thing. She was a dick when he brought some things in saying we never had the conversation. 

Also one thing to note, I am messy. Always have been. I have adhd, depression and I’m sick sometimes. So sometimes downstairs in my area … there’s cups on my coffee table and clothes in my bathroom floor. It’s not in her area. I don’t spend time in her area. I don’t make messes in her space. My bf doesn’t care that I am messy. Loves me anyway. Love him for that. But he’s also not super concerned and doesn’t pick up after me. It’s not bad all the time but sometimes I do let it get out of hand. It just depends. That’s really where my mom has helped me especially when I was super sick. Bc she likes things to be a particular way. And if it’s not that was she is a dictator. Even as a grown adult if I have a cup on the coffee table and see her coming I am hiding that fucking cup before she sees it. With my bf here she wasn’t able to be all up in my shit all the time so when she would come downstairs and it was messy she was NOT happy. We spent a 4 hour car ride dropping her off in Dallas she did not say a word to us. We went to the zoo with the kids and when he opened the door for  her , she would not go thru it. We snuck to the side to vape and she said she thought he was taking a pee and cussed in front of the kids. He asked her what was going on. She said she didn’t know what he was talking about. He said… no I think something’s going on. It’s ok if we have a conversation about it. She literally got in his face and yelled at him at the zoo. It was the most mortifying event in my life at that point. Now she has gotten a part time job along with social security. My little sister has a job but brother is still not working. The last two months I have asked them to help with rent out of spite bc she was working and not offering anything at all. Just hoarding her money. 

Since then she’s stolen my medicine bc side effects make you skinny, lied, recorded bits of conversations and sent them to family members. She puts you in impossible situations where she does something passive aggressive or just plain aggressive. If you don’t say something she wins bc she gets what she wants and if you say something she makes you look like an asshole. 

Last time she took my shot I asked her about it, she lied to me and I said please stop lying, she waited till she saw my son behind me and started yelling and screaming and cursing at me. At that point I knew I was moving out. This was also in front of my boyfriend’s 5 year old. I applied for a house the next day, told my mom today that we got approved and we are moving out on the 1st. My brother started smashing things, she went thru all of our stuff when we were gone and my brother threatened to beat up my boyfriend. This shit is insane. I feel like three people can make this shit work and me and my kid can finally live in a stable environment. It’s been a long time. I just wanna be on my own. I’m healthy and motivated. I’ll be 40 this year and she just keeps escalating. ",4,1740295778.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

This is our first trip together so I want it to be special. She has been to Chicago a few times- she went to school in the area, but I have never been. 

I am only Silver status so keep that in mind- we will be in the most basic rooms without any upgrades or free breakfasts. Looking at the JWM, Lasalle, Gwen, EMC2, and Blackstone. Maybe I am missing others contenders, I have heard the Ritz is a bit dated. The St. Regis is out of our budget currently- but I’d like to get there eventually. 

I know the JWM + Lasalle are not in a tourist area, but we are not opposed to doing 1 night at one of those two and the other 2 nights in River North at one of Gwen/EMC2. I have never stayed in JW or Luxury Collection hotels before so I am interested in trying them out.

Also- I’d love any restaurant/bar recs! Again we’re a little price conscious- ie no $200 pp steakhouses or $25 per drink bars- but open to just about anything else (she doesn’t eat seafood). So far I’m looking at Ciccio for a nice dinner, Au Cheval + Loyalist burgers, Portillos for a dog, maybe somewhere for an Italian beef. I’ve never had deep dish pizza either. Rooftop bar/casual breakfast/coffee spots, anything in River North/Fidi areas, I’d love to know.

day 1-7: fly into guatemala city, shuttle to lake atitlan for 1 week of spanish school, maybe do coffee tastings and hopefully hike

day 8-10: go to xela for volcano hikes

day 11-15: go to antigua for volcano hikes and probably other stuff, Fly home

I am big into hiking and it's one of the main reasons I want to visit guatemala!

But now I'm remembering about Semuc Champey and Tikal, and me being American I don't get many opportunities to take time off to travel. 

Im thinking of adding on five days and flying out of Belize City for some itinerary like:

day 1-4: fly into antigua, hike volcanoes

day 5-11: lake atitlan, Spanish school

day 12-14: xela, volcano hikes

day 15-17: semuc champey

day 18-19: tikal

day 20: see Belize? then fly out?

would semuc champey and tikal be worth it? should I cut xela for a couple more days in Belize?

☕ Coffee/Beans: Ethiopia Hamasho (Carbonic Maceration)
💰 Price: in the ₱250-300 range (paid almost ₱900 for three: matcha latte, iced latte, and a pourover)
⭐ Rating: 4/5


We visited on a weekday morning around opening time, so it wasn’t busy—just one other customer was there. Since we’re from the province and don’t have access to specialty cafes, this was an exciting experience for us :)

The barista was great! When I ordered a pourover, he asked about my preferences and showed me their available beans. Not sure from what roaster it was, looks like they roast in house? The bags only had hand-written notes on it, anyway I went with the Hamasho Carbonic Maceration. It would have been more accurate if it was described as natural/washed/honey processed fermented in an anaerobic environment for X number of hours since carbonic maceration is just a part of the process, but my guess is that it was a either a Natural or Honey with its flavor profile. 

He brewed it using Orea, with lower temp, 89C if I remember correctly because it’s supposed to be a funky one. The final cup had mild acidity, similar to a subtle fruit juice—bright but not overwhelming. It stayed enjoyable even as it cooled, with no bitterness at all. It was good!

We also had a great chat about brew ratios and techniques. The highlight? He let me brew behind the bar! I brewed a washed Colombian Gesha from SEY, we tasted it, and I got feedback on my technique—super fun! Feeling barista ako haha! I wish I had more time, but we had to check out of our hotel, so it was cut short. The only downside? Now I feel tempted to upgrade my gear—especially a temp-controlled kettle and an Acaia scale after trying it out, super responsive. 

One thing I forgot was the water they used, may nabanggit sya about it but I forgot — it tasted like sparkling or soda water.

Overall, it was a great experience! I really like their open bar setup, if we’d come at a busy time it would probably be a different experience. But I would love to visit again next time. 

The day before we visited Satori, we also stopped by Habitual Coffee. Unfortunately, the experience was underwhelming. We had arrived early in the morning, which wasn’t a busy time, and there were only two other customers in the shop. When I inquired about the beans available for pour-over, they offered Ethiopia Sidama and Brazilian beans. However, I didn’t get a chance to ask for more details, since the barista was too focused on cleaning/operating the espresso machine. Feeling a bit rushed, I quickly chose the Brazilian beans, as I’d never tried Brazilian coffee before. While it was drinkable, it didn’t stand out or impress me in any way.

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) . I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation* ( mega important ) let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this while while having a smoke and watching Dutch streamers react too a show called “lang leve de liefde”   .sometimes I’m funny but don’t ask me to tell a joke ( that’s not how it works bro ) fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream( no I don’t have reasons why I just don’t , it’s not that deep ). I have adhd and think about a million thoughts a second it feels like . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

- Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning 🫶🏻)
- a lot of random playlists I’ve made 
- complaints about nonsensical things ( example the weather , how much milk cows produce , songs I wish didn’t exist ?)
- someone that you can annoy at any time of  the day 
- someone to have coffee dates with virtually ( no you don’t have to drink coffee I certainly will ) 
- just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings 
-Dutch memes but you won’t get ;) ( what a steal ! )

But modern-day lifestyles — including processed foods, environmental toxins and stress — can overwhelm this crucial organ. Certain natural drinks can be introduced into the daily diet to help and restore liver function. 12 Drinks that Help with Liver Health

**Warm Lemon Water**

Drinking warm lemon water in the morning is great for kick-starting digestion and increasing bile production to help remove toxins. Lemons are high in vitamin C and antioxidants that help protect the liver against oxidative damage. You just need to take half a lemon and squeeze into a glass of warm water and drink on an empty stomach.

**Indian Gooseberry (Amla) Juice**

Amla is famous for rich vitamin C levels and strong antioxidant abilities. Drinking fresh amla juice can improve liver functionality and help in detoxification. Make Jucie by mixing up fresh amla mix with water with a pinch of honey.

**Turmeric Tea**

Turmeric is a common spice that has been shown to contain the chemical compound curcumin, which has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It may also aid liver cells in repairing and bile production when taken regularly. How to Make: Take a glass of hot water, add 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder, and a pinch of black pepper for better absorption; you can also add honey for taste.

**Beetroot Juice**

Antioxidant-rich beetroot and nitrate-containing beetroot can enhance blood circulation and liver function. Beetroot juice can help reduce fat deposits in the liver and improve lipid profiles. We mix raw beetroot with ginger and a squeeze of lemon for some extra flavor and benefits.



**Carrot Juice**

Carrots are full of beta-carotene and flavonoids, which protect the liver against toxins and oxidative stress. The use of carrot juice might improve liver enzyme function and position me for better overall health. Just add a little ginger or lemon for flavor.

**Green Tea**

Green tea is full of catechins, antioxidants that help prevent fat buildup and reduce liver inflammation. Drinking green tea regularly can be effective for liver health and reduce the risk of developing liver diseases. Choose unsweetened green tea, if possible, to get the most out of it.

**Aloe Vera Juice**

Aloe vera is known for its detoxifying and anti-inflammatory benefits. Aloe Vera juice helps digestive and liver function. To use, combine fresh aloe vera gel with water and a touch of honey.

**Coriander Seed Water**

Coriander seeds contain substances that can help control excess bile production and detoxify the liver. Soak one tablespoon of coriander seeds overnight in plain water, boil in the morning, and drink warm.

**Papaya Leaf Juice**

Enzymes that can support liver function and detoxification are contained in papaya leaves. Papaya leaf juice, when diluted in water and consumed in limited quantity, could improve liver health and alleviate inflammation.

**Wheatgrass Juice**

Wheatgrass is a chlorophyll-rich, nutrient-dense food helping to detoxify the liver. Adding fresh wheat grass juice into your daily routine can enhance your liver health massively.

**Dandelion Root Tea**

The dandelion root can be traditionally used to support liver health. It promotes bile production to help with digestion and detoxification. Or steep dried dandelion root in hot water for several minutes and drink it as a tea.

**Coffee**

Drinking moderate amounts of coffee has also been associated with a lower risk of chronic liver disease. Coffee may help protect the liver from certain types of liver disease by preventing the accumulation of fat and collagen, two major markers for liver disease. Drinking black coffee without any sugar or creamers can be very helpful.",1,1740294590.0,u_No-Pilot6350,0,1.0,False

He's the nicest guy I've ever met, he shows me all the time that he cares about me, and he knows me the best out of anyone. However, we keep having the same issue over and over that leads to blow out arguments where we don't talk for hours on end, because neither feel they are in the wrong and should apologize. It isn't healthy and I am growing very tired of it, and I am not sure what to do, or if I am overreacting. 

He is very messy. We moved into our first apartment together a year ago and while I'm not an overly clean person, he is very unclean. I had the flu for the last week and only felt well enough today to go downstairs and it was disgusting. I'll focus on the things that bother me the most. The living room has his dirty clothes thrown everywhere. The recliner is pulled 1 foot from the tv because he plays video games and the coffee table is right beside of that so I can barely walk through the living room to the kitchen. The coffee table is filled with trash and old fast food bags and his personal belongings. 

I've asked him specifically not to do any of these things, as it makes me not want to spend time down there with how gross it gets. I texted him when I was upset , but I've been working on trying approach things calmer because I know how he reacts, thinking I'm nagging him. I said ""It is so disgusting down here. I’m so tired of having to ask you every day to do things like put away food or clothes or trash"" and explained how I dislike being in the living room due to this. 

He ignored the messages and started talking about completely different stuff. I told him thanks for ignoring the messages and he said he read them. To me that isn't enough. I said he had the opportunity right in that moment to continue the conversation in a respectful way (acknowledging the messages) and he still did not do that and acted like everything was okay. It angered me even more. Then he called me annoying. 

Now we aren't speaking and he hasn't apologized. I feel like a parent and like I shouldn't have to say these things. He has so much time to clean up but chooses to play video games or do other things instead. I don't know what to do anymore about this. I've talked to him about it more times than I can count yet he continues the behavior and cannot communicate. 

Other than these moments, our relationship is great and he's the best person I know. But I can't shake this because it feels like pure disrespect towards me and our shared space. 

TL;DR : how do I get my boyfriend to respect our space and communicate effectively even though I've asked him many times, with this being our biggest argument? Or am I doing something wrong?",1,1740294488.0,relationships,5,1.0,False

Most places have insane amenities that almost seem to just add all your (lifestyle) monthly costs together such as entertainment , washer and dryers in units , on site security and surveillance , 24 hour concierge ( just in case I loose my key ) , hubs for Amazon orders , free unassigned parking for you and your guests, yoga and Pilates classes, pool areas with cabanas,  gyms , community events such as movie nights , continental  breakfasts , cafes, business centers, trash valet, the list goes on. Considering this when it comes to me budgeting my entertainment , gym bill, money spent on coffee weekly, laundry facility costs, assigned parking costs, cycling classes, etc it all adds up to the amount I would pay with rent included if not significantly cheaper .

1iw4eb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1iw4eb8/i_prefer_coffee_to_beer/,“I prefer coffee to beer”,"That was the phrase on his Happn profile, but I didn't give it any importance. 
I only looked at his photographs, which were quite particular, and at the features of his bad, dark man's face. 
A dark, rock and roll profile that in no way coincided with my classic and somewhat intellectual profile. 
But, the truth is that I was going through a severe depression that kept putting me in bed, in silence, and trying to calm my anxieties with an anxiolytic. Of course, I know perfectly well the reasons for these depressions and, particularly, they are the feeling of loneliness, disconnection and emptiness. 
So that strange man, who wrote to me with so much courage, quickly entered my mind. 
He called me on the phone and there I noticed his impulsiveness: he said he was going to see us at 2 in the morning and he was talking on the phone while he was driving. 
I also noticed that he was verbally abusive because of how he expressed himself. And the most frightening thing of all was that he confessed to me that he had tried every drug except heroin. That shocked me, but at the same time attracted me. I have never tried any drug in my life, except my anti-anxiety medication. 
It is true that I could not stop thinking about him, but each communication made me disillusioned once again with his bad words or with very open details of his life such as “I go to the jungle every year to do the Ayahuasca ritual.” 
My rational self said “this is not for you,” but my irrational self wanted him to look for me until I finally met him and in a very informal way: in a square, at 10 p.m. 
He was short, had an unusual haircut and was carrying something in his hand that he put in his mouth. I asked him what it was and he told me it was an e-cigarette and that he was trying to quit smoking. 
Then, he made other comments about his relationship with coworkers that seemed not to be good and before deciding to get into his car, he slipped this comment: “a year ago a bottle of whiskey passed in front of me and I didn't feel anything.” 
Good. 
She was already educated on the subject from movies, documentaries and internet searches: he was an addicted cop. 
Once in his car he showed himself to be selfish and verbally abusive, but always very transparent and sincere. He told me that his ex used cocaine and that she stopped when she got pregnant. 
And what was I doing there listening to all that misery?
We kissed, but I didn't feel any emotion on his part, in fact, I thought he would need some very strong stimulant for sex and the truth is that I would be afraid to be intimate with someone like that. 
He asked me strange questions, he seemed to be looking for a partner, he told me that I didn't see myself ready to love someone, but his language was so vulgar that we argued loudly and I left. It was too disrespectful. 
He tried to find me on the app shortly after but I rejected him and although I have tried to forget him, I still think about him and I would love to write to him, but reading you and the experiences you share makes me not do it. 
I just needed to express this here. 
My father was an alcoholic his entire life and I never spoke to him. 
He was violent and hit my mother. My older sisters were the ones who went to the police station to report it. As an old man, he abandoned his vices and died of depression. I never spoke to him nor did I feel anything for him other than shame and rejection. 
So I don't understand how I can think of this man with so many consumer disorders.

Drinks - Ordered the El Placer (Chili Bourbon) with Notes of Bell pepper, mint, stone fruit, and grapefruit Pour Over. This was amazing! Normally I order fruity ones but was feeling adventurous. This was not chilli hot but was more full bodied. 💯 recommend.

Ordered the iced cafe mocha using the filipino beans milalittra - this was far better than tightrope’s cafe mocha. Very smooth and the sweetness was on point. (Versus tightrope cafe mocha that hurts my throat). I will gladly order this every week! I also recommend :)

Service - Lovely barista making the pour over. Explained the process well. The cashier had a very low voice though so could not understand well but nice people nonetheless.

Ambience - The cafe was packed in the first floor but second floor there were less people.
You are greeted with a good whiff of coffee as you enter the door. Always a good thing!

Price - Was pleasantly surprised to spend only 440 on both coffees. 

Overall - will come back and recommend. I have always heard of this cafe recommended but never been here. I frequent tightrope but have never located this until recently, and happy to do so!

1iw4adx,https://www.reddit.com/r/crystallography/comments/1iw4adx/rip_george_sheldrick_19422025/,RIP George Sheldrick (1942-2025),"Got this email earlier this week and thought I would share with the community about the crystallography legend. 


Dear Colleagues,
 
it is with a heavy heart, that we must announce the passing of George Michael Sheldrick.
Everyone in crystallography knows George as a giant in the development of computing methods despite his unassuming manner. His SHELX programs for structure solution and refinement have shaped the field and their use has been key to innumerable projects. The same is valid for his contribution to data processing and analysis in the programs he wrote for Bruker detectors. Only those young to crystallography will have missed that while typically our papers are scored by the impact factor of a journal, one paper of George rocketed the impact factor of the journal Acta Crystallographica A from 2.05 to 54, surpassing that of Science, Nature or Cell in the year 2010. This establishes how many scientific projects must have been aided by George´s insightful work and bright solutions.
Those of us who have had the privilege to meet George in person also know him for his passion for problem solving, originality, sense of humour and deep humanity.
 
George has touched the lives and careers of so many group members, providing a work environment that was simultaneously sheltered and free. He was always receptive to our ideas, encouraging our independence, providing the means to support them and giving us credit for what we accomplished. At the same time, we were spared the financial worries or conflicts attached to any institute. If Goethe was right in writing that character is built in the tempest of life while talent requires the calm, George shaped the optimal environment to develop our talents. An unusual trait of George is that he always pondered what people said, not who said it. Experience shows that humans are more ready to value what their friends, allies and referents state as being correct and search for reasons why their competition must be wrong! This lack of prejudice may explain why George´s research group was always most diverse: he gave everyone fair opportunities.
In lectures, talks or conversations, George would explain complicated concepts making them come across as compellingly simple. His teaching would always prompt critical thinking, as when he faked a nuclear explosion producing a mushroom in his chemistry lecture with experiments. This was the 80´s and half of the audience started an im promptu demonstration against nuclear power before being absorbed in the debate of why this was impossible and the analysis of what experiment had really taken place.
Working with George was inspiring and fun, it covered a broad range of interests in chemistry, geology and biology evolving along the years. In Cambridge and Göttingen, George closely supervised more than a hundred theses. Former students and co-workers would frequently stop in Göttingen and pop up to join the coffee time, where daily group discussions would take place. Many of us have kept in touch ever since, resorted to him for advice or just for the pleasure of discussing science and puzzling problems.
George Sheldrick will be missed.
 
Regine Herbst-Irmer and Isabel Usón

Similar to lots of other people here, I'm still looking for a job despite countless applications with no word or sign that things will get better. I worked as a PM for 8 years and the last couple tried to transition over to software engineering. I know, I'm such an idiot, bad timing and all, I thought it would be a good skill to have!

Right now, I'm scared. Like...Irrationally scared. And my confidence is in the gutter. I grew up poor and often times was homeless. My mother was a single parent who didn't speak English very well so I had to grow up fast. I've been working since I was a kid and have not stopped until I lost my job last year. This is the longest stretch of time I've been unemployed. I've managed to save up enough to keep me afloat for a while but the lack of a job is scaring me so, so, so much. I'm not going out, seeing friends, or eating much to try to save as much as I can. I've lost 20lbs but honestly I probably am benefitting a little from that according to my doctor, so that's good right?

Does anyone here have any ideas on what to do? I'm trying to find anything and everything I can apply for. I've applied to retail jobs, coffee shops, warehouse work, receptionist, etc. I have some event planning experience from unofficially being voluntold to plan all my corporate events so I've looked into that as well but no luck. I'm probably approaching these so wrong since I'm not even hearing back. Corporate jobs aside, should I approach applying for retail/customer service job differently than online? I've always been the type of person to do any work. I'm currently cleaning/managing an Airbnb for family and dog sitting for whatever cash I can get.  I'll do whatever at this point, I just don't want to be homeless again.

1iw487w,https://www.reddit.com/r/unOrdinary/comments/1iw487w/character_gai_terran_and_golem_revamp/,Character: Gai Terran and Golem Revamp,"# Appearance

Gai is a short teenager, at 5'2, with light brown messy curly hair and caramel eyes. During school time, he wears the Wellston school uniform with glasses. Outside of school, he likes to wear coffee colored shorts, white undershirt, and a tan sweater. His vigilante outfit consists of a black long sleeve shirt and with a military vest tucked under tan cargo pants with a utility belt and a black motorcycle helmet with no visor.

# Personality

Gai is usually stoic and likes to keep to himself, focusing on his studies. He likes to help and converse with his peers, but likes to keep the conversation short. But because he is easy to talk and confront with, his peers do enjoy talking and hanging out with him, even However, he can never turn a blind eye to those in need. Whenever he catches someone being bullied, he steps in to help, diffusing the situation. As a vigilante, he becomes more expressive, enjoying the fights as well as helping the local citizens. He takes his vigilante life serious, as he hides his full ability at Wellston and does well to hide his identity as to not blow his cover. When activating his ability not being a vigilante, he will not activate his constructs and only fight with the initial stat enhancement of the ability. Behind a drawer in his room is a map and detailed notes of EMBER and their locations. He's driven by his morals instilled to him by his late Grandpa, and vows his best to use his ability to help others as much as he can.

# Powers & Abilities

**Ability:** Gai has the ability **Golem** and is at a current **level of 6.1**. As a **Low-Tier**, his ability was known as **Strong-Build** that increased his Power upon activation. As a **Mid-Tier**, this ability would also increase his Defense. Once Gai reached **Elite-Tier**, his ability would evolve to Golem, allowing him to construct two gauntlets on his arms, further increasing his Power. At **level 4**, he would then be able to generate gauntlets on his legs. At **level 4.5**, he would then be able to generate a chestplate that would allow him to mitigate damage by circulating the force of the impact throughout his body, and then redirect it out. This ability also increases his size, giving him a height of 6'0 and a slightly bigger body mass. At **level 5.0**, his gauntlets can now reverberate his strikes throughout their target's body. So even if the opponent blocks, the impact will still damage the target with the force of the attack. At a **God-Tier**, he is able to generate leg armor to further enhance his Defense and mitigation skill. He is also able to produce a shockwave in the direction that he punches. This skill derives from his reverberation punches, by applying it to the air in front of him. His passive skill, **Sturdy**, gives him a Power and Defense **level of 2.5.**

**Physical Abilities:** Even without his ability and passive, Gai is notably good at hand-to-hand combat, able to outpower and maneuver Mid-Tiers and sometimes Elite-Tiers. His combat has similarities to boxing, muay thai, and wing chun. he practices on a punching bag in his room. Although his hand-to-hand combat is proficient and outclass most of his peers, he is still out-skilled by John.

**Intelligence:** Gai is considered to be one of the few smartest students in his schools, with his peers usually going to him for help in studying and figuring out problems. In battle, his intelligence is displayed well, usually waiting for his opponents to attack, dodging and tanking damage to analyze their movements and pattern. Once he's finished analyzing, he rushes in, countering and defeating his opponents.

**Weakness:** If the constructs are broken, Gai cannot utilize the mitigation and reverberation skills of his ability reducing his battle capabilities. Although Gai excels in close combat, against enemies who can attack from a distance, he is at a disadvantage. His shockwave punches give him some range, but they are nowhere near as effective as true ranged abilities. Opponents who can keep him at bay and prevent him from closing the distance pose a challenge. While Gai is strong and durable, he lacks in speed. Extremely fast opponents—like those with speed-based abilities—can evade his attacks and land multiple hits before he can react. His mitigation helps reduce damage, but against relentless high-speed assaults, he can still be overwhelmed.  Although highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat, Gai’s fighting style heavily relies on countering and absorbing damage before launching a decisive counterattack. **Opponents who recognize this pattern** can exploit it by feinting attacks or overwhelming him with unpredictable, rapid strikes.

I am both equal parts spontaneous and a planner, love deep conversations, and value communication, honesty, kindness, creativity, and leftist political values. I thrive in a balance of social time with friends and partners, but also cherish solo moments to recharge. I'm a major nerd.lol very queer. I am autistic and have ADHD so just be patient with me.

1iw43yq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iw43yq,The Ultimate Men’s Guide to Coffee: From Beans to Brew,"Coffee isn’t just a drink—it’s a ritual, a lifestyle, and for many, an essential part of the day. But with so many options, brewing methods, and styles, diving into the world of coffee can be overwhelming. Whether you’re looking to elevate your morning routine or impress friends with barista-level skills, this guide has you covered.

Understanding Your Beans
The foundation of great coffee starts with high-quality beans. The two primary types you’ll encounter are:

Arabica: Known for its smooth, complex flavors and lower bitterness, Arabica is the go-to for specialty coffee lovers. It typically grows at higher altitudes, leading to a more refined taste with notes of fruit, chocolate, or nuts.
Robusta: With a bolder, more bitter taste and higher caffeine content, Robusta is often used in espresso blends and instant coffee. It grows in lower altitudes and has a more earthy, grainy flavor with hints of dark chocolate.
Other varieties include Liberica and Excelsa, which offer unique and unconventional flavors, though they are less common in commercial coffee production.


Roast Levels and Their Impact
The roast level plays a crucial role in flavor, aroma, and caffeine content:

Light Roast: Retains more of the bean’s original characteristics, often with fruity and floral notes. It has the highest caffeine content by volume and is best for those who enjoy a brighter, more acidic taste.
Medium Roast: Balanced flavor, acidity, and aroma, making it the most popular choice. It often carries a smooth yet robust flavor with hints of caramel and nuts.
Dark Roast: Rich, bold, and often smoky, with lower acidity and strong chocolate or caramel notes. These beans are roasted longer, giving them a heavier body and more oil on the surface.
Brewing Methods Every Man Should Know
Your choice of brewing method can dramatically change the taste of your coffee. Here are some must-try techniques:

French Press: Rich and full-bodied, perfect for those who enjoy a strong cup. This immersion method allows the coffee grounds to steep in hot water before being filtered by a plunger.
Pour-Over (V60, Chemex): Highlights delicate flavors with a clean and crisp finish. Pouring water in a slow, circular motion allows for optimal extraction of coffee oils and flavors.
Espresso Machine: The base for lattes, cappuccinos, and Americanos, offering concentrated coffee with a bold kick. Mastering espresso requires understanding grind size, tamping pressure, and extraction time.
AeroPress: Compact, portable, and capable of producing both espresso-like and smooth coffee. A favorite among travelers and coffee enthusiasts alike.
Cold Brew: Steeped in cold water for 12-24 hours, resulting in a smooth, low-acidity coffee. Perfect for hot weather and a great base for iced coffee drinks.
Moka Pot: An old-school stovetop method that brews strong, espresso-like coffee with a rich body. This is a favorite for those who love a traditional European-style brew.
Perfecting Your Coffee Routine
Grinding Matters: Invest in a burr grinder for consistent grind size, which is crucial for balanced extraction. Different brewing methods require different grind sizes; for example, espresso requires a fine grind, while French press needs a coarse grind.
Water Quality: Always use filtered water to avoid unwanted minerals affecting the taste. The ideal water temperature for brewing is between 195°F and 205°F.
The Right Ratio: Stick to the golden ratio of coffee-to-water (1:16) for a balanced brew. Experiment with ratios depending on your taste preferences.
Experiment with Milk and Alternatives: From classic steamed milk to oat and almond options, experiment to find your perfect combination. Some alternatives add natural sweetness, reducing the need for sugar.
Mastering Latte Art: Once you’ve nailed the espresso, take your skills further by practicing latte art. Start with simple designs like a heart or rosetta and refine your pouring technique.
Must-Try Coffee Drinks
Expand your coffee repertoire with these classic and modern favorites:

Espresso: The foundation of all strong coffee drinks, served in a small concentrated shot.
Americano: Espresso diluted with hot water for a smoother taste.
Latte: Espresso with steamed milk and a touch of foam, offering a creamy texture.
Cappuccino: A stronger, frothier version of a latte, with equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam.
Flat White: A creamy yet bold drink with microfoam, popular in Australia and New Zealand.
Mocha: A chocolatey twist on a classic latte, combining espresso, steamed milk, and cocoa.
Affogato: A shot of espresso poured over vanilla ice cream for a decadent treat.
Cortado: Equal parts espresso and warm milk, offering a smooth and rich balance.
Turkish Coffee: A traditional, unfiltered coffee prepared with very fine grounds boiled in a cezve, delivering a strong and bold taste.
Irish Coffee: A classic cocktail made with coffee, whiskey, sugar, and topped with cream for a warming, indulgent experience.

Coffee Pairing Tips
To truly appreciate coffee, try pairing it with different foods:

Light Roasts: Best with fruit-based pastries, citrus desserts, or light breakfast options like yogurt and granola.
Medium Roasts: Pairs well with nuts, milk chocolate, and mild cheeses.
Dark Roasts: Complements rich, bold flavors like dark chocolate, smoked meats, and aged cheeses.
Espresso-Based Drinks: Pair well with buttery pastries like croissants or biscotti.
Final Thoughts
Coffee is more than just caffeine—it’s an experience. By understanding the nuances of beans, roasts, and brewing techniques, you can elevate your daily cup into something truly extraordinary. Whether you’re savoring a slow pour-over, perfecting your espresso shot, or crafting a creamy latte, the perfect coffee is always within reach.

Take your coffee game to the next level by exploring different brewing styles, investing in quality equipment, and experimenting with flavors. The journey to becoming a true coffee connoisseur is a rewarding one, filled with endless possibilities for taste and refinement.",1,1740293145.0,u_His-Trends,0,1.0,False

My neice, let's call her Jackie, came to live with me to get out of a very toxic relationship with her baby daddy. She moved several states away with her child (who is 2). I have an apartment on the second floor. My apartment also has 2 bedrooms so I had the room to give her to help her out. So the problems started immediately with dirty diapers all over and food on the floor. I asked her to clean up after her child but the stains and messes keep piling up due to her not watching the toddler. She was on her phone all the time. She lived with me for a total of 4 months. She had food stamps at the time but switching states they were taken away. In the meantime she didn't get a job until she was here with me for three months. I paid for everything which was fine because I knew she didn't have a job. Finally she got a job and got a few paychecks which were, I assume were at least 1200. She never told me anything about her money or offered any to me for food, rent, gas, electric ect. In the total 4 months living with me and using my car she paid me a total of 180 dollars! 20 of which she asked for back to buy diapers. She would come back with expensive alcohol and drink. On top of that she met a guy on a dating app and convinced him to come up and see her. I told her I was not comfortable with this since I dont know this guy. You see this stuff on 48 hours all the time. She had the audacity to ask if he could stay here. I was like hell no. This was early on her stay here. This is important because she then systematically decided to sabotage my apartment. I got home from work of which I work in health care 40+hrs a week! I go to take a shower and can't find any towels. Like none! So I go in her room and found them all moldy in her closet. Dirty. They were brand new. So I got upset at that. She did dishes or took out the trash maybe a handful of times the entirety of her stay. At night she would ask to use my xbox and then stay up all night and wanna sleep all day. The toddler was sometimes kept in the room all day. So I complained about that. She lost silverware to my gold silverware set, left an important coffee cup at work that I received from a previous job that I treasured. Put huge framing nails in the walls to put up her stuff. The child threw dirty diapers and hit me in the face with one of them, he broke the hinges on my living room trunk, broke anything he got his hands on and when I told her she would get mad saying ""hes a 2 yr old"". Its been the most horrible experience of my life. Garbage, dirty diapers, tampons left in the toilet ect. So the guy really did come up to see her and unfortunately I agreed to let him in the house. I didn't sleep a wink. I didn't want to be around them so I went and stayed a couple nights at my moms. When I came back my house was trashed!! Bottles and cans everywhere, dirty clothes on the floor in the bathroom and to top it off she went in my room while I was gone and broke something very precious to me that was porcelain.

I had these two friends (friend 1 and friend 2) and we were a friend group. A group with 3 people never go well as it's hard to balance out love and affection.

He also me a few times. He told me I smelled like strawberry. I kept wearing that perfume for the rest of the summer.

Of course the seeds didn't grow. Due to the fact that the grass was fake. We called them ""Beans"" because they looked like little coffee beans. Me and my friend (friend 2) made a game where we collect the ""beans"" and throw them and make a wish. There I admited I liked guy 1. Of course she was excited and I felt so much better telling her. Eventually I told friend 2 as well, but later in the timeline because she was visiting china to see family. I liked friend 2 better than friend 1 because friend 1 liked to act better than others which made me angry and got really defensive when I was only hanging out with friend 2.

The first was a meeting in a cafe with a walk, the second was a restaurant and a walk that I suggested. The third was a spontaneous invitation to a concert from her. The fourth was a walk through the city followed by a chat in a cafe and the fifth was with her yesterday. We walked through the city for almost four hours and ate in a restaurant. All the dates were very positive from my point of view, we harmonized well with each other, talked and joked about everything. She constantly kept eye contact with me, laughed at every joke I made, no matter how bad, and never once looked at her smartphone. I tried to flirt with her more, touching and hugging her gently. She never rejected any of this, but these signals never came from her. During our last date after about half an hour we sat on a bench and I told her that I liked her and would like to get into a relationship with her, I asked her if she was dating someone else at the same time (we met through Hinge). She said she wanted to broach the subject anyway and that she saw it as more of a friendship than a relationship with me, but that she wouldn't rule out a relationship and that I should also meet other women. I was surprised by this because the previous dates had gone so well and asked her why she saw it that way. Her answer was basically “I don't know, I'm a bit stupid”. She has only had one relationship in the past, which was a long time ago and in which she was unhappy, and she suffered from her parents' divorce when she was young. I told her that it could be that she finds it difficult to make an emotional commitment to someone or that she doesn't know what exactly she wants from a relationship. She said, yes, that could be the case. We still had a really good date afterwards, went for a walk for hours and ate in a restaurant. After the restaurant, we walked down the street and she suddenly hugged me very tightly and for a long time. I asked her if everything was okay and she said “I just need a hug now”. She also said a few times during the date that she would be sorry if we broke off contact, but she would understand. When we said goodbye after about three hours, she asked when we would see each other again - I said “Tomorrow?” - She said “let's write together”. And that was it; since then I've been unsure what to write to her and she hasn't written anything either. We usually write to each other a lot. We're very similar in terms of character and life situation, we're both introverted, taller than average and have similar hobbies. And as I've already said, I like her a lot. I brought her flowers or chocolate as a small gift every other date, asked if I could pay for dinner or coffee every time, which she usually agreed to (we both earn well) and I complimented her wherever I could. In terms of physical contact, unfortunately we haven't held hands or kissed on the lips yet. What can I do to salvage the situation somehow?",1,1740291612.0,dating_advice,6,1.0,False

I’m a bearded and tattooed 39 year old guy that is pretty bored and lonely.  I have a family but I can’t help but feel empty I guess. Let’s fix it.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I’m a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can’t sing.

I’m love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Who are you, actually. How do you understand life and yourself. Let me know you and you know me and we’ll see where it goes.

1iw3nir,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1iw3nir/map_code/,Map Code,"Here are a few options to tweak and enhance your **Map Code** for Home Assistant:

# 1. Add Multiple People Tracking

* Track multiple people by adding them under `entities`
* Assign unique colors per person

# 2. Dynamic Theme Adjustments

* Switch colors based on time of day (e.g., night mode with dimmed colors)

# 3. Pet Tracking

* If your pets have GPS trackers, integrate them into the map

# 4. Weather Overlay

* Add a weather card near the map for real-time weather

# 5. Custom Icons for Zones

* Modify `zone` markers with custom icons (e.g., work, gym, coffee shop)

Now, here’s a **tweaked version of your code** that:  
✅ Supports multiple people  
✅ Adds night/day theme colors  
✅ Enhances waypoints with animated lines  
✅ Uses different colors for different users
