1qxvmlk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/1qxvmlk/incontinence_questions/,Incontinence Questions,"I'm one month post RALP today...hard to believe one month already! I had my catheter removed 23 days ago; but who's counting! 

Anyway, I need to ask about some symptoms and what you think I'm doing wrong or not doing.

I wore the full diapers for almost 3 weeks, then changed to the pads about 4 or 5 days ago. I've been doing fairly well, I thought, but yesterday it all seemed to change! I went with feeling a little leak or two when I stand up, or walk around, etc...especially when I kneel down/stand back up...to suddenly not having any control at all! I'm fairly good while sitting/lying down, almost no leakage at all, but as soon as I stand up, the flood gates just open! By the time I get to the bathroom, there's nothing left to pee out! I just went for a 15 minute walk. I put some TP in my shorts between me and the pad, went for the walk, and when I returned, the TP was soaked! The last 24 hrs I seem to just go/leak out constantly! Last night was the first time I've ever leaked past the pad I was wearing, and I did wear a full diaper to bed last night!

I don't drink regular coffee or beer; I drink Chamomile tea in the morning and water throughout the day. I splurged with a half glass of red wine the evening before this started, and I've had a couple small decaf coffees the last few days, but that's it for liquids.

So I'd like to know if anyone else has gone through a period of relapse after seeming to be improving. I read on another post about causing the bladder to become overactive...any ideas on what I might be doing to cause that?

They say we need exercise, but as soon as I do something, I lose it; so I sit too much so I can go to the bathroom less often and try to train my bladder to hold more and learn to not need to go as often. 

The last thing I should mention is I haven't really been doing any pelvic exercises, but when I'm able to have a full urine stream, I can fully stop it by squeezing! So I feel my kegels are in decent shape; but if there are any other exercises that would help, I'd definitely be interested.

1qxvlmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChaseSapphire/comments/1qxvlmw/the_edit_benefit_review_wayfinder_waikiki/,"""The Edit"" Benefit Review - Wayfinder Waikiki","Wanted to share my experience with using my CSR's ""The Edit"" benefit when booking the Wayfinder Waikiki! We stayed for 4 nights, and because my husband and I both have the CSR, we were able to reap double the benefits. He booked 2 nights and I booked the next 2 nights. Then I called Wayfinder directly to see if our reservations could be combined to stay in one room the whole time. They were able to make that happen.

**Cost:** Wayfinder is the most affordable hotel in Waikiki that qualifies as a ""The Edit"" hotel in the Chase Travel portal. When booking through the Chase Travel Portal, we used a mixture of points + $. We allocated it so that we both spent exactly $250 each, and paid the rest in points. That way, we took full advantage of the $250 Edit statement credit.

**$100 Property Credit:** We used this on valet parking ($49/day). Because we had $200 combined in property credit, our parking was free. The $100 property credit can also be used on food/drinks from the coffee bar, Redfish restaurant (located in hotel lobby), the bar, and merchandise.

**Complimentary Breakfast for 2:** Pretty good selection (the meat lovers omelette + Vietnamese coffee was our favorite combo!) at the RedFish located in the hotel lobby. You're given vouchers upon check-in to present at the restaurant. Breakfast hours are great too (7am - 1PM)!

**Early Check-in:** We arrived on a Thursday and were unable to check-in prior to 3PM. We just hung out at the pool where they happened to be giving out free popsicles!

**Late Check-Out:** We were able to enjoy a late check-out time of 1PM (on a Monday) after inquiring with the front desk.

**Other Wayfinder Perks:** 2 drink tokens upon check-in, hypoallergenic pillows upon request,  various free events on premise (uklele class, hula class, lei- making class, sunset DJ by the pool, etc.), special decor in room for occasions.

Overall we felt very taken care of at the Wayfinder, and the perks through CSR made it even better! Highly recommend :)",1,1770415874.0,ChaseSapphire,0,1.0,False

1qxvkgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_S_tories/comments/1qxvkgr/my_grandparents_cut_off_my_mom_when_she_was/,"My grandparents cut off my mom when she was pregnant with me, now they want to attend my wedding.","Let me explain.

My grandma and Grandpa were super religious people, I’m not talking about the religious were they go to the church every Sunday, I’m taking about the religious where all the photos in their house is about Jesus and the church.

 so when mt mom had me at 19, still in college. She was scared, and alone since she didn’t know the father, which made it worse.

still, she never gave up on me, she worked 5 jobs to keep us afloat, and has a side job as a janitor at a hospital that smelled like vomit and medicine. 

 I remember once when I was 8, I asked her for new shoes, since mine he holes in them and were getting a bit old. She looked at me with tired eyes and said “**When pigs fly”**

I just thought she was being weird or whatever so I didn’t question it. The shoes never came.   
once I was 10, I asked her “mom, can you buy for me colors? I want to draw!” she just said “when there is a cold day in hell,” so I learnt to never ask for anything.

one day, I came from school early and I saw my mom sitting at the kitchen table, eviction notices everywhere, where eyes were red and puffy, like she was crying. When she saw me, she tried playing it off “oh honey! Your home early!” She said, her voice breaking at the last word. “Mom what’s all this?” I asked, still in my school uniform. ”We are getting evicted soon.” She said, her voice shanking.

So I worked my butt off. studied at the school library, to reduce the electricity tax, got three jobs, a barista at the morning, baby sitter in the evening, and cashier at night.  
I also was the top of my class, always getting full marks and A+‘s. 

my teachers always said how I would be in a amazing university and how I would make it to a amazing job, but in reality, we couldn’t even afford milk.   
Fortunately, I got a full ride to my dream university and got my bachelor’s degree and master’s degree in law, surprised my mom with a new house, and paid every penny off my student loans,

One day, I was sitting at this cafe, coffee in hand, scrolling through my insta when a man walked by, probably mid thirties, looking around for a table “is this seat free?” He points at the chair across from me, and I just nod, because what are u supposed to say? 

we talked for a few minutes, and he was actually funny and listened. We did end up exchanging numbers in the end.

we officially claimed it as our first ‘date’ even tho we didn’t plan to meet.

we started dating and 5 years later, he proposed with this 15 karat diamond ring, i said yes before he even finished the sentence. My mom was the first to know, and she cried, like actually cried. She held my had s and told me “I’m so proud of you, do you know that?” over and over again, like a broken record. We planned this large wedding with 150+ guests, this amazing venue with a giant chandelier, photographers and even our honey moon in Spain for 2 weeks planned out, which cost like 50,00+ total. 

I posted a picture on instagram 2 hours after he proposed, just me showing off my ring with the caption: He just proposed 2 hours ago! Can’t believe I’m marrying the love of my life!”

I turned off my phone and thought nothing of it.

next day, i turned my phone on, and I had like 99+ notifications on instagram, all proper congratulating me and saying how proud they are of me.

15 minutes later, I got a call from an unknown number. At first i hesitated, because it could be anyone trying to scam me, but I picked up anyways, because something in my gut told me it was important.

”A-aubrey?” I almost dropped my phone, that‘s my name.

”W-who is this?!” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. 

“Its me.! Your grandma!” Said a tired voice from the other end.

”What do you want?!” I said my voice slightly higher.

”I saw your post, I just wanted to tell you how proud I am of you.”   
“Thanks..” i said, hesitantly

 “ I want to be in your life again, Aubrey.” She said, sniffling. “I made a mistake and I want to fix it.”

I laughed.

”You had 28 years to try to be in my life. 28 years ago, you could have been in the same room as my mother aa she gave birth to me.”

”People make mistakes!“ she said, defensively.

”funny for you to say, because when my mom was pregnant, you told her to get out, to find a job and a apartment, to deal with a baby by herself at 17. Where was all that ‘people make mistake’ when my mom was 17?”

”Thats different! She committed a sin!”

I hung up.

I never invited her to my wedding. it was perfect, just the way we imagined it. Our honeymoon in Spain was exactly like we planned, from Barcelona, to Madrid to Valencia.

My mom died 5 years later, at the age of 50, and I will never forget what that woman sacrificed for me.

1qxvje1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qxvje1/aitah_for_calling_people_i_know_idiots_for_not/,AITAH for calling people I know idiots for not looking after their kid?,"This is a throwaway account.

My husband owns a café 50/50 with our friend N. N has a cousin D who is married to L. D and L have a 15 month old and a 4 month old. They regularly visit the café with their children, as I do with my son who is 10 months old. I usually visit just when my husband works so he can spend time with our son and we can enjoy a coffee together as a family. My husband also works at another place to bring in extra income to the household so those would be the only moments he gets to spend more quality time with his son because it's not busy when we visit.

So here's the thing, D and L are pretty young, they're in their early 20s, I think they're both around 21-22. They are very neglectful of their kids, even before she gave birth the second time and they'd visit with their first born he'd always be dirty, she would always yell at him for no reason, maniacally push the stroller to get him to sleep, etc. I've always brushed it off because I didn't want to engage or create drama because of my husband and his co owner. Even at 6 months they would just let him stare at youtube on their phones so he would keep quiet so they can drink in peace, which I have and always will be judging. 

Well today my son and I visited dad at work and there was no one in the café but us, and my son wanted to fall asleep in the stroller. He doesn't mind noise or music, he's used to it and soundly sleeps. He was almost there until D and L walked in with their children. My son eventually fell asleep despite them yelling, but I didn't say anthing about them being really loud because I've never felt entitled to a public space nor will I ever ask someone to do something like that.

The biggest problem with them is ignoring their toddler when he's walking around the café yelling, throwing stuff, entering behind the bar, pressing buttons he shouldn't, they just scroll on their phones or play games on them and eventually yell at their son. He hits himself and then starts crying, and they yell and hit him instead of consoling him. Today the little fella was roaming around the café while they played a game together on their phones and completely ignored the kid (the other baby was sleeping in the stroller). I would usually go up and play with him to at least be sure he's safe if my husband has our son, because it's not his fault his parents are idiots. My husband also does this because we feel bad for the kid. Today we decided to mind our business as other people's kids are not our responsibility. At one point the kid fell and hit himself HARD. His mom yelled at him, his dad immediately whipped out YouTube for him to calm down. 

I flipped and said, ""You can't act like idiots and play games on your phones while you ignore your children. Poor thing must've hurt himself a lot."" The child was SCREAMING in pain. They quickly paid and left but it was so visible on their faces that they were butthurt, they didn't even say goodbye.

I'm questioning whether I overstepped with my reaction, was I too rude? Should I have just minded my own business?",1,1770415726.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

COVID really impacted my social life, and I had a lot of breakdowns during that time, feeling like people left me, for better or for worse. Eventually, I realized that I needed to stop depending on others for happiness and start focusing on myself. I began building new hobbies, like going to the gym and swimming every day. I even took private swimming lessons and learned how to swim.

But even though I’ve grown so much and made positive changes in my life, I still feel that itch in my heart when I see groups of people hanging out together. I miss that sense of community.
Well now, I’m deep into my degree, and my schedule is packed. I don’t have much time for socializing, but when I can, I’ll grab coffee with a friend in the afternoons, and that’s about it.

As for dating… well, when I was in my early 20s, I wasn’t really ready to date seriously. I just enjoyed the attention I got from men, but I didn’t want to get stuck at home with a boyfriend while my friends were still out having fun. I know it sounds silly now, but I was young and naive. (Don’t get me wrong—I didn’t have one-night stands or anything like that. I wanted to be with someone I actually dated, not just a random guy I met at a club.)

Now I want to find love and might want to have a family one day (I’m not getting any younger). But I know you might tell me I need to date a lot before that happens, and I’m worried men won’t see me as wife material since I haven’t had any meaningful relationships. I’ve been focused on my studies most of the time, so I haven’t had a chance to be more approachable(didn't mean to), even though I’ve been trying lately.

During production, it wasn’t just about sets and scenes. Hotels were fully booked, local restaurants and coffee shops were busier than usual, and there were tons of short-term jobs directly tied to filming. Crew members were spending money locally, and small businesses definitely felt the bump.

What stood out to me was that the effects didn’t disappear once filming ended. People still visit filming locations, ask locals about the show, and spend money in the area because of it. It turned TSITP into a pretty good real-world example of how film and TV productions can have lasting economic effects on the places they’re shot.

Goal is to ride 3 or 4 laps and then grab coffee where we'll drink a hot drink and share stories of past hour+ of misery and camaraderie. 

All are welcome. We'll pick a coffee shop before the start of the ride, likely LPQ in the park, and riders can ride their own pace if the group pace is too slow/fast and we'll meet INSIDE the coffee shop after the ride.

Dress warm. Cover as much of exposed skin as possible. Ski goggles/helmets/balaclava/mittens are suggested non cycling gear that work very well in lower temperatures. Don't bother filling water bottles, they will be rock solid and not usable.

I feel incredibly lucky and grateful that it did not take long. I’m writing this because I did quite a few things differently this month. It may have helped or just been luck, but I was religiously looking at posts like these so now I want to write one!

The day before ovulation and the day of ovulation I used a small amount of preseed (just up to the #1 line I think) and put that in around 15 minutes before. After sex I put in the Frida conception cup and left it in for one hour. I did hold my legs up/have a pillow underneath me for around 15-20 minutes but I did that the other months as well.

2 days before ovulation I began drinking raspberry leaf tea, then switched to rooibos ovulation day and onwards. Could definitely start the raspberry leaf tea earlier.

During my tww:

I drank 8 ounces of pomegranate juice every day.

I started the morning with warm lemon water and Celtic sea salt. Instead of coffee, I had matcha (1.5 tsp) 30 minutes after eating breakfast.

I ate INSANELY well. Healthy but also ate a lot. I did not want my body to go to hunger mode so I made sure I was always eating something. I also ate only hot/warm foods, lots of soup, nothing cold (not even water).

Food I ate:

70% dark chocolate

Japanese sweet potatoes

Mushrooms

Spinach

Eggs

Avocado

Kale

Wild caught salmon

Poppi instead of Coke Zero (I love Coke Zero)

Lots of grass fed red meat

Cheese

Whole milk

Lentils

Sourdough

Miso soup

Lots of grass fed butter

Fruit (banana, raspberries, blackberries)

Almonds

1 Brazil nut a day

White rice

Tomato soup

Chicken soup with tumeric

Everytime I complain to my family they say I am just overly sensitive to noise and such. I know I just need to live alone and the lease ends in a few months but please tell me if I'm crazy. Here are some things that bother me the most:

1. She has a dog and doesn't sweep the dog hair. I am allergic to dogs (which she knows) so I need to sweep it every day to keep the allergies in control.
2. I have to clean up after her every day. Leaving crumbs on the counter, stains from food/coffee, etc. 
3. Her s/o will just walk into the apartment because they have a key. She doesn't tell me when they're coming over so it's always a surprise. She showers and makes dinner here too.
4. She watches a lot of tv and I've asked her to lower the volume when I'm working and she won't. 
5. She leaves for work very early and doesn't lock the door when she leaves. So when I wake up the front door is always unlocked.

So am I crazy? Or are these genuine things that should be bothering me? I've already invested in ear plugs and a noise machine which I sleep with when the s/o comes over but I don't know what else to do.",3,1770414818.0,badroommates,4,1.0,False

If you want context, here it is, but it's not needed to answer the question:
About two weeks ago, we bought the Ninja Luxe Cafe Pro for ease of use ability and some other reasons. Personally, i'm not impressed, and my GF is on that side too, but not fully.
I started weighing my shots, and they are all over the place. Once i did grind size 15 and i hit 28 sec and 32g output. The next day, i thought i would try grind size 16, and i hit like 32sec with a 62g output with the same strength. This was with the wdt and spring-loaded tamper.
I got a spring-loaded tamper because the damn built-in tamper isn't even close to level.
I then did more research, and now we are here. Should we get the bambino plus with a df54/baratza encore, esp? 
My GF is on the fence because of the auto frother, she doesnt believe the bambino plus will froth as well as the ninja because of the extra spinning thing in the buttom This is basically the only reason she doesn't want to change.
I drink americano, so i dont care about it.
Also, i dont need ""just do it manually"" comments. Auto is a must for now, maybe in the future.
I'm not the biggest coffee drinker, but i'm a nerd at nature, so i succumbed to do it perfectly for some reason. And the ninja hurts my soul atm.

Edit: GF said that if the frothing is bad, it ruins the whole coffee. But i'm convinced a better grinder and less good frothing is still better.
Also, she does cappuccino and not latte",0,1770414807.0,espresso,3,0.5,False
1qxv4kc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qxv4kc,"The Haul: Celine, DT, SI & The Rest","Got everything in and broke it all in over the weekend. Quick thoughts on each piece.

Celine Hoodie
White hoodie hits that perfect balance. The drape is natural, no stiff retail feeling. Spilled coffee right after putting it on and wiped it clean. Zero stress.

Denim Tears Pants
That ape head print has a subtle texture you need to see IRL. Wore them out and got the nod from someone who spotted the brand. Perfect fit, no loose threads.

Stone Island Zip-Up
Pink color is bolder than expected but works. Fabric feels technical but breathable. Water rolled right off during a light drizzle. Badge catches the light just right.

AJ4 Black Cat (KX/KZ)
Shoes were scuffed in the box but the build is solid. Leather has a nice depth to the black color. Laces are thick and durable. Perfect for night walks.

FOG Essentials Hoodie
Heavy fabric but broken in from day one. Fit sits right on the hips. Didn't ride up at all during the day. Hood stays in place.

Nike Ankle Socks
Quality is just okay—functional but unremarkable. Cushioning present, yet feels slightly cheap. Serves for gym runs.

G-Shock GA-110
Classic white G-Shock. Keeps time with a minor drift after a week—nothing major, but worth noting. Still tough as nails.

EA7 Tracksuit
Gold logo adds a nice touch without being flashy. Fabric feels premium and drapes well. Buttons line up perfectly. Great for travel.

AF1 Black (AF Batch)
Stiff at first but breaks in nicely. Classic AF1 sole cushioning. Toe box gives room but keeps shape. No creasing after full day wear.

•Designers say “UX” to mean on-screen interaction.

 •”Product design” got stolen by the software people ;(

•""Physical UX"" has confused people in my experience.

•Close relatives are “Tangible Interfaces”, “Physical Computing”

You must be over 18 years old. No married cheaters or ONS. But, FWB might be ok if there is a connection. Please know how to hold a conversation and actually want to get to know one-another.

I am very liberal, kind and fun. I am an extroverted-introvert and enjoy both staying in and watching a movie or bingeing a good show (currently Supernatural). But, I also enjoy going out to grab coffee or a drink, see a movie, a play, drag show, burlesque show, or a live music show. Also enjoy museums and nature. I enjoy going dancing at clubs especially goth clubs. Or, just a nice walk. I love history and science, and learning new things. I am neurospicy and understand what that means if you are too. I am s\*x and body positive. I won't use up all your spoons.

I grew up as a punk rocker and goth kid. I played music in bands throughout the 1990s mostly in punk, emo and garage-rock bands. Now days I spend a lot of time with my two kids and partner (they are my heroes). My partner is also poly and we date separately, but tend to be more of the Kitchen Table type.

I would like to connect with females, trans-females for chatting to see if we vibe. I am also open to chatting with sissyboys and femboys if it feels right. Please be liberal and political. Have a passion, and take care of your mental health. Social drinking is great, but no alcoholics. 420 positive, but please no potheads. No, heavy drug use like coke, meth and the like.

RemitBee just published a breakdown of the new federal announcement regarding the GST credit. If you’ve been feeling the sting at the grocery checkout lately (especially with beef up 16% and coffee up 30%), this is some much-needed news.

The Highlights:

* The Name Change: The GST credit is now the Canada Groceries and Essentials Benefit.
* The 50% Top-Up: There is a one-time payment coming this year that is equal to 50% of your current credit.
* Long-term Boost: Starting July 2026, the credit is permanently increasing by 25%.
* The Numbers: \* Families of four: Up to $1,890 this year (vs the usual \~$1,100).
   * Individuals: Up to $950 this year.

Why this matters for our community: We know many of you balance your budgets tightly to ensure you can still send support back home. This extra breathing room in your Canadian bank account means you don't have to choose between a full fridge here and a transfer to your family.

1qxuol6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Short_Method_7680/comments/1qxuol6/i_built_a_sleep_app_because_i_was_taking/,I built a sleep app because I was taking screenshots of my Apple Watch data and pasting them into ChatGPT at 3am,"I originally got an Apple Watch to track my swim sessions. At some point I started wearing it to bed — not because I was into biohacking or quantified self stuff, but because I have a specific insomnia pattern I wanted to understand.

I don't have trouble falling asleep. I'm usually out in minutes. My problem is the 3am wake-up. Like clockwork, I'm wide awake in the middle of the night, and my brain immediately kicks into high gear (work ideas, things I forgot to do, sometimes genuinely good insights that I almost wish I could turn off). Then I lie there for two hours, finally drift off around 5, and my daughter wakes me up at 6:30. You can do the math on how that feels.

So the Apple Watch gave me data. Deep sleep stages, light sleep, REM, heart rate, HRV, respiratory rate, wrist temperature. Charts and numbers every morning. And I looked at it all and thought… ok, now what?

Knowing I got 38 minutes of deep sleep doesn't tell me *why*. Was it the espresso I had at 2pm? The fact that I ate late? The stressful call I had before bed? The workout I skipped? The data alone was just a report card with no teacher's comments.

So I started doing something kind of ridiculous. I'd screenshot my sleep data each morning, paste it into ChatGPT, and type out what I'd done the day before (caffeine, alcohol, screens, exercise, stress level, dinner time). And I'd ask it to look for patterns.

After a few weeks of this, things actually started clicking. I noticed my 3am wake-ups were significantly worse on days I had any alcohol, even one glass of wine. My deep sleep was measurably better on days I did a late afternoon walk. Eating dinner before 7pm versus after 9pm was a bigger factor than I expected. None of this was in the Apple Watch summary. The watch told me *what* happened. The context I was manually logging told me *why*.

The problem was that this workflow was absurd. Screenshots, copy-pasting, manually typing out my day, trying to remember if I'd had coffee at 2 or 3, scrolling back through weeks of chat history to find a pattern I vaguely remembered. I was losing insights because the process was too messy to sustain.

That's when I started building SleepWizard. The core idea was simple: what if the app pulled your Apple Watch biometrics automatically, asked you a quick 10-second check-in each evening (caffeine, alcohol, stress, screens, exercise — tap tap done), and then had an AI sleep coach that could actually analyze your data *in context* over time?

Not generic sleep tips like ""avoid blue light"" that you've read a hundred times. Actual personalized analysis: ""Your deep sleep has dropped 22% over the past week. The common factor on your worst nights is screen time after 10pm combined with eating after 8pm. On nights where you avoided both, your deep sleep averaged 1h12m.""

I spent a lot of time in the sleep research literature tuning how the AI coach works, things like sleep debt tracking over a 14-night rolling window, how different sleep stages respond to different behavioral inputs, and what actually matters versus what's noise. The evening check-in is designed to be fast enough that you actually do it every night (because the data is useless if you skip days), with a bit of a gamified feel to keep the habit going.

Anyway, that's SleepWizard. It started because I was a tired dad pasting screenshots into a chatbot at 3am and thought there had to be a better way.

Celine Hoodie
White hoodie hits that perfect balance. The drape is natural, no stiff retail feeling. Spilled coffee right after putting it on and wiped it clean. Zero stress.

Denim Tears Pants
That ape head print has a subtle texture you need to see IRL. Wore them out and got the nod from someone who spotted the brand. Perfect fit, no loose threads.

Stone Island Zip-Up
Pink color is bolder than expected but works. Fabric feels technical but breathable. Water rolled right off during a light drizzle. Badge catches the light just right.

AJ4 Black Cat (KX/KZ)
Shoes were scuffed in the box but the build is solid. Leather has a nice depth to the black color. Laces are thick and durable. Perfect for night walks.

FOG Essentials Hoodie
Heavy fabric but broken in from day one. Fit sits right on the hips. Didn't ride up at all during the day. Hood stays in place.

Nike Ankle Socks
Quality is just okay—functional but unremarkable. Cushioning present, yet feels slightly cheap. Serves for gym runs.

G-Shock GA-110
Classic white G-Shock. Keeps time with a minor drift after a week—nothing major, but worth noting. Still tough as nails.

EA7 Tracksuit
Gold logo adds a nice touch without being flashy. Fabric feels premium and drapes well. Buttons line up perfectly. Great for travel.

AF1 Black (AF Batch)
Stiff at first but breaks in nicely. Classic AF1 sole cushioning. Toe box gives room but keeps shape. No creasing after full day wear.

1qxuje5,https://www.reddit.com/r/publix/comments/1qxuje5/office_rules_question/,Office Rules Question,"So, I'm a deli employee.   
Out of curiosity, for employees from other delis and other departments, what is your store's policy for personal items being inside your department office?   
  
To expand on this, what is your store's policy on keeping water/drinks inside the office?  
  
My deli, around the end of 2024/beginning of 2025, was told that we were no longer allowed to keep personal items in the department on the hooks near the office. Those hooks were then permanently removed, save for one to hold the kitchen aprons.   
  
Most people began putting their items in the break room lockers. However, a few of my fellow employees (including myself), received an addendum to the rule so we could keep our medications in the office/department to maintain the workflow needed to operate our deli.   
  
This all changed today.   
  
We were told that we were no longer allowed to keep ANY personal items, INCLUDING water or drinks anywhere in the department.  
  
Need a sip of water? You have to go across the store to the breakroom or fight your way through customers to the drink machine.   
  
Need to take time-sensitive meds? To the break room. 

To preface, our deli is extremely busy, most of the time. We're lucky if we even manage to get bathroom breaks or LUNCH breaks, a lot of the time. 

I can understand not wanting someone unloading their entire personality in the office or not wanting employees to have a buffet in the office.   
But to deny easy access to water/medication in a high-workload environment such as the deli seems.... wrong. Even according to OSHA standards, potable water needs to be ""as close as possible to working areas, especially for jobs requiring high physical effort or in hot environments"". The only exceptions being if it poses a contamination risk. Which, being away from food prep areas, I wouldn't think that it would pose one.  
  
It also feels very targeted on the store manager's part (cause these changes started happening when they began their employment at our store). Bakery department can keep any number of personal items in their office, in the actual department, or on the hooks in their department.   
Meat literally has a coffee maker and a mini-fridge in theirs.  
  
Is it a corporate rule that my fellow associates and I are not aware of? Or it is strictly from the store level?

I appreciate any input on this matter, as I am just genuinely confused as to why this would be a rule for one department, but not others. ",1,1770413388.0,publix,3,0.6,False
1qxuj9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1qxuj9b/adderall_xr_stomach_pain/,Adderall XR stomach pain,"Hey y’all! I got diagnosed with ADHD about 2 months ago and have been cycling through medications to find one that helps. My psychiatrist started with Wellbutrin and Effexor to avoid stimulants at first and while Wellbutrin was AMAZING I had a super weird physical side effect (my right eye had so much pressure behind it, started twitching, felt like something was in my eye) and she advised I stop it and wow, the eye thing immediately stopped. 

That has led me to now, she had me try concerta and I just didn’t feel any different. It made me super tired and lethargic and now she has me on Adderall XR 15mg. I’m on day 6 of taking it. On day 4, I tried to go without taking it but I admittedly didn’t have any coffee or anything and I felt SO nauseous, cold sweats, and light headed and so I caved and took one and felt better. Today, day 6, I was getting ready for work and within an hour of taking it I was SO nauseous again that I ended up throwing up. I thought I felt better but then I had the most intense and painful stomach cramps. They would come in waves, but it was horrific. I found that not moving at all helped a little bit, so I called out and have spent the day on my couch trying not to move. Here I am after 8 hours and the Adderall has basically worn off and I feel fine. Has this happened to anyone else? What can I do to make sure this doesn’t happen again? I only ate a pop tart and drank a chai latte with my medication, so if the solution is eating something more substantial then I am more than happy to do so.

1qxuh46,https://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1qxuh46/moh_speech_help/,MOH Speech Help,"Hi everyone! would love your thoughts on this speech below.

Hi everyone! I’m S. I’ve had a front row seat to the beautiful whirlwind that is L's life since 2019. I am her Matron of Honour, her unofficial wedding planner, and as of today, the person who gets to tell you how these two wonderful, chaotic humans finally found each other.

L and I met at the City, and I quickly learned that she is a woman of great strategy. Her plan was simple: “Always befriend the admin, because they know where everything is.” She wasn’t wrong, and she was so committed to this strategy that she’d visit my cubicle every single day to chat. But I soon realized that L doesn't just walk through life, she experiences it at full speed, usually with a coffee stain on her shirt. She actually spilled coffee all over her top on the way to her very first interview for the City, and yet, in true L fashion, she walked in and nailed it anyway.

That resilience is her superpower. Whether she’s hitting her own garage door because she’s distracted by her ""outdoor cat,"" or nearly committing arson with a chafing tray warmer while catering a wedding, L picks herself up with a smile and keeps going. She is the only person I know who warms an Uncrustable on a candle warmer, and she’s the only friend I have who is so in sync with me that we are official ""CPAP buddies."" When I got a rice cooker, she bought the exact same model and the exact same brand of rice just to make sure our lives stayed perfectly calibrated. We talk so much that if I don’t message her by 8:00 AM, my iPhone literally sends me a notification to check on her.

I often wondered what kind of man could handle that level of energy. Then came Sh. After their first FaceTime, she told me her cheeks hurt from smiling so hard. On their first date, I gave her a ""fried shrimp"" emoji code word in case she needed an escape, but for the first time ever, L went totally radio silent. She didn’t need an escape; she’d found her match.

Because, as it turns out, Sh has his own brand of chaos. He is the only man I know who would go hunting in the wilderness in the middle of winter and realize he forgot to pack socks *or* underwear. He’s the guy who snaps his winch cable while stuck in deep snow, looks at the disaster, and simply says, “Well, that’s not a good idea,” before going back to hunting. He is famously absent-minded—whether he’s trying to light a fire in a blizzard with a stack of flyers and lighter fluid, leaving a pile of cash behind in a hotel room, or sending texts with absolutely no context—he is the perfect, quiet balance to L's storm.

L daydreamed about this day for a long time. She told Sh repeatedly: “Talk to S when you’re ready.” So, naturally, when Sh was finally ready to propose, he called… my husband, M. He told M, “I’m going to propose, but whatever you do, *don’t tell S*.” M had to explain that if he wanted the ring to fit, and if he wanted to live to see the wedding day, he had no choice but to call me.

Standing on that cliff at MacDonald Trail and witnessing him get down on one knee was the honour of my life. It was a moment that proved that while they might both forget their socks or their coffee, they never forget to show up for each other. Sh, you reflect L's light so beautifully. You don’t try to quiet her energy; you make space for it and make it even brighter. You are the steady, solid ground she can always land on.

L, you are the sister I never knew I needed. Everything has lined up so naturally for you two. You’ve built this beautiful home, and just down the road is Larry Lake. I truly believe that isn't a coincidence. I believe your dad has been part of every step, watching over every mountain peak and every new beginning, knowing you finally found the man who would love you and protect you as much as he did. Seeing you blossom into the woman you are today, standing next to Sh, is all I ever wanted for you.

If everyone could please raise their glasses.

To L and Sh: May your life together be the greatest adventure you’ve ever known. May you always be each other's calm in the storm, and may the love you share today grow deeper with every sunrise over the mountains.

To the happy couple! Cheers!",0,1770413245.0,wedding,5,0.5,False

* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* **Childfree** (this means you neither have NOR want children. This is non-negotiable.)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.)
* close enough to whereabouts I'm at so we can see each other regularly
* NOT a cigarette smoker!

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* What about my post stood out to you and/or made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?
4. Would you rather live in 24 hours of daylight or darkness?",1,1770413134.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1qxudnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qxudnp/i_need_some_advice_on_my_relationship_with_my/,I need some advice on my relationship with my girlfriend.,"So My girlfriend Leona and I have been together for a year and a half. We live together most of the time. She's wonderful，kind, gentle, and considerate，and I love her deeply. But  some things have happened, and I really don't know how to handle them. I hope someone can give me some advice on how to bring it up without hurting our relationship or making her feel attacked.



This post might be a bit long because I need to explain everything to see what the real problem is.



Leona and I met when I was a sophomore in university, studying in the Midlands of England. It was late October, around 7 pm, and it was already dark outside. I was doing a statistics assignment in the library when she sat down at my desk without saying anything. She smoothly sat down in the chair opposite me, slowly and deliberately blinked, and said, ""You look tired.""



I was immediately captivated by her. She had sharp green eyes and long reddish-brown hair, and the way she tilted her head as she looked at me made me feel completely understood by her. We talked for hours, or rather, I did all the talking and she listened, occasionally offering soft words of encouragement.



She was taking night school veterinary medicine, specializing in feline care. She explained that she was always more energetic at dusk and dawn, but around midday she would become drowsy and barely able to do anything. “But evening classes? I’m really good at them,” she said.



We soon started dating. She loved physical contact, always snuggling against my neck, and rubbing her cheek against mine while watching movies. She really enjoyed physical touch. Because of her schedule, our dates were always in the evenings or early mornings, which suited me perfectly.



About six months later, we decided to share an apartment near the school. Our landlord, Mr. Peterson, was very clear about no pets. He talked for at least five minutes: no cats, no dogs, no rodents, nothing. I noticed Leona seemed a little nervous listening to him, her fingers clenched into fists, but she still politely smiled and agreed. Later, we walked back to school together, and she said, “I love cats. I love all cats. They’re simply perfect creatures, you know? Independent yet gentle, elegant, I understand them.”



There was a hint of melancholy in her voice. I knew how much she loved cats, and I promised her that maybe after we graduated from university and had our own place, we could get a cat. She immediately brightened up.



We moved in at the end of November. It was only then that I truly began to understand her daily routine. She went to her veterinary class around six in the afternoon, came home around midnight, ate something，always protein, usually cold chicken, fish, or cooked meat straight from the package，and then sometimes remained active until two or three in the morning. After that, she slept until two or three in the afternoon, sleeping like a log. Once, I dropped an entire drawer of dishes next to the bed, and she didn’t even move.



What surprised me was that, although I knew my girlfriend was obsessed with cats, she quickly became familiar with all the cats in the neighborhood. I mean all the cats.



“Those are whiskers,” she would say, crouching down and meowing at a tabby cat. “That grumpy old man at number 47. He has urinary problems, and his owner ignores him，I can smell it.”



“You can smell it?”



“My nose is very sensitive, a veterinary student’s skill.”



She would make that meowing sound, and all the cats within a three-block radius would suddenly appear. They would run over, rub against her, and purr loudly. I had never seen anything like it. She knew the local cat population inside and out—their names, medical histories, personalities, even where they liked to sleep.



About three months ago, something  

happend really disturbed me. Around three in the morning, I woke up to use the bathroom, and when I came back, Leona wasn’t in bed. I found her in the living room, sitting motionless on the floor in front of the wall.



She was staring at a point about two feet above the baseboard. Her eyes were wide open, unblinking, pupils dilated, even with the light on. Her head remained at its usual tilt, completely still. Her breathing was so soft that I had to look at her chest to make sure she was still breathing.



“Leona?” I whispered in the doorway.



No response. No reaction whatsoever. Not even a tremor.



“Honey, what are you doing?”



Still no response. I moved closer, growing increasingly uneasy. She hadn’t blinked even once. I had never seen anyone go so long without blinking.



“Leona, you scared me.”



I gently touched her shoulder. She immediately turned her head, looking bewildered, and yawned widely. “Oh, I must have been sleepwalking. I’m sorry, darling. Go back to bed.”



She fell asleep immediately, and I brought it up the next afternoon when she woke up.



“That’s strange,” she said, looking worried.



“What were you looking at?”



“I don’t remember. That’s what sleepwalking is like, right?”



That seemed plausible. But the same thing happened again the following week. And more than once. Always between 2 and 4 a.m. Sometimes she would stare at the wall, sometimes at the junction of the wall and ceiling. Once, I found her staring at the crack under our bedroom door, her face almost touching the floor. Another time, she was in the bathroom, staring intently at the space behind the toilet.



Each time, she had no recollection of it the next day. When I brought it up, she became wary.



“Marisa, I can’t control my sleepwalking. I didn’t do it on purpose.”



“I know. I’m just worried. Maybe you should see a doctor?”



“I’m fine. Maybe it’s just too much coursework.”



I tried to suggest she switch to daytime classes, pointing out that if she was still wandering around at 3 a.m., it was no wonder she couldn’t get up during the day.



“No,” she said with unusual firmness. “I can’t. I have to go at night. I can’t move around at noon. If I have to move around when the sun is high, I’ll get sick.”



After that, I didn’t bring it up again. But I started paying closer attention to her. Sometimes I'd stay up late writing my thesis, listening to her move around in the apartment. No TV, no music. Just movement. Occasionally I'd get up to check and find her sitting motionless, staring at something I couldn't see.



Once, I saw her staring at a corner of the ceiling for a full forty-five minutes, completely still, her eyes unblinking, her breathing slow. Then, I saw a spider crawl by.



I haven't mentioned it. I was very uneasy at the time.



Another thing still disgusts me to this day.



It all started one morning when a dead rat appeared in the kitchen. It was lying there next to the trash can, its neck clearly broken, in a strange position, as if someone had placed it there, rather than letting it die.



I guessed it had eaten some poison and crawled in to die. I wore rubber gloves and cleaned it with a dustpan, feeling very uncomfortable.



Two days later, another one appeared. Then another. Always when I woke up in the morning, always dead, always in strange places. One was on the kitchen counter. One was in the bathroom sink, another on my textbook.



I asked the neighbors if they had a rat infestation. Mrs. Chen downstairs looked at me strangely. ""Dead rats? No, dear, not a single one.""



Mr. Harrison across the hall said the same. The couple at the end of the hallway hadn't had any problems either. Only our family had them.



The rats kept appearing. One by one, always in the morning, always appearing where I was sure I could see them.



Then, a morning I'll never forget arrived.



I woke up around six in the morning. Leona was sleeping soundly beside me; she slept like a log during the day. Half-asleep, I got up to make tea and looked down at the floor beside the bed.



There were at least fifteen dead rats, neatly arranged in a circle around the bed—the kind of large rats you see in restaurant alleys.



And they weren't scattered randomly; they were arranged neatly. Evenly spaced, each equidistant from the others. They were all facing the bed, their lifeless eyes staring blankly at us. The precise arrangement shocked me; their placement was as accurate as mathematics.



I gasped, hoping I hadn't woken the neighbors.



Leona stirred, groggily sitting up and squinting to adjust to the morning light. She looked at the mice, then at me, and said casually, ""Oh, sorry.""



""Sorry—"" I couldn't finish. My voice sounded strange. ""Leona, there's a ring of dead mice around our bed.""



""I'll clean it up,"" she said, now fully awake, and she got out of bed. She began picking them up with her bare hands, without gloves or tissues, and then put them in a garbage bag like dirty laundry.



""Where did they come from?"" I asked, backing away until my back was against the wall.



“I don’t know. Maybe it’s the apartment? I’ll have to call pest control.”



“But why are they arranged like this? They’re in a perfect circle.”



“A coincidence?” She avoided my eyes. She looked guilty, really guilty, like when your dog eats a cookie, deep guilt.



“You—” I couldn’t even finish the question. This was ridiculous.



“I didn’t do it,” she said, but her voice sounded strange. “I don’t know how they got there.”



She silently finished cleaning up, tied up the garbage bag, washed her hands, and went back to bed. She hugged me, making those rumbling noises, trying to soothe me.



“I’m sorry, you scared me,” she whispered. “I promise I’ll find out what happened.”



We watched a particularly silly movie that afternoon, and after that, neither of us mentioned it, and the mice never appeared again.



Instead, around the same time, I noticed that anything placed high up would fall and break within 24 hours. The top of the closet, the tall shelves, the refrigerator. Anything placed high up and fragile eventually shattered.



The mug on the bookshelf. The picture frame on the mantel. The decorative bowl on the windowsill. The plant on top of the cupboard. My favorite teacup, fallen from its high shelf.



After the seventh time, I asked Leona directly, “Did you knock something over?”



She looked hurt.



“Everything I put high up broke, everything,” I said.



“Maybe you didn’t put it properly. Or maybe there’s something wrong with the building.”



But she wouldn’t look me in the eye; she kept looking away.



I decided to try. I put a bowl on top of the refrigerator, set up my old film camera—the old Canon my dad gave me—and prepared to take a long exposure photo. I put the camera on the shelf opposite the refrigerator and went to class.



When I came back that afternoon, the bowl was shattered on the floor.



I took the film to the university darkroom to develop it, and when the image appeared in the developing solution, I felt a wave of nausea.



Clearly visible, a large orange cat was perched on top of our refrigerator. Long-haired, enormous, at least fifteen pounds.



The photograph was crystal clear, without any blur or flaws. It showed a large orange tabby cat on our apartment's refrigerator, where pets weren't allowed.



We didn't have a cat. Cats weren't allowed in this building. We lived on the third floor; how could a cat have gotten in? More importantly, where was it? When I got home, I found the dishes broken, but the cat was gone.



I took the still-damp photograph home and showed it to Leona.



""Look, there's a cat in our apartment.""



She glanced at it, then looked away after about half a second. ""It must be some kind of double exposure. Old-fashioned cameras are so unreliable.""



One afternoon, while Leona was still sleeping, Mr. Peterson knocked on our door. He looked embarrassed.



“Miss Deere, I need to ask, do you have any pets?”



“What? No! Absolutely not. It’s written in the lease, I wouldn’t knowingly break it.”



“Your girlfriend recently received some unusual packages. The postman mentioned it to me.” He glanced at his phone. “Two large boxes of cat grass. One large box of cat toys—balls, wands, tunnel toys. One large box of catnip. Several boxes of premium wet cat food. A cat tree. A heated cat bed. An automatic water fountain.”



I just stared at him. Yes, we did receive packages. Leona often shops online; she has her own bank card, but I’d never really looked at the contents. She always brought the packages in and opened them while I was in class.



“I know nothing about it,” I said honestly. “Let me talk to Leona.”



That night, I waited for her to wake up. Around three in the afternoon, she finally woke up, yawning and stretching, and I went straight to the point.



“The landlord said you’ve been ordering cat supplies. And a lot.”



She looked embarrassed. “Oh, you mean that?”



“Yes, that’s it. We don’t have a cat, Leona.”



“It’s for my nephew,” she said quickly. “My sister’s son, Sam. He loves cats. I’m getting him a birthday present.”



I tried to recall her nephew. I’d seen him a few times in videos; all this stuff seemed a bit much for a kid.



“He’s very enthusiastic. And…” She shifted uncomfortably. She gestured with her hands, “Some of it is for the stray cats in the neighborhood. You know I love them. There’s a group of stray cats behind the Chinese takeout place. I’m trying to get them used to humans so I can eventually catch them and get them vaccinated.”



“And the cat tree?”



“It’s for the shelter after catch them. I want to make them more comfortable, and the automatic water fountain is because cats like running water.”



This wasn’t unreasonable. She was pursuing a veterinary degree and was passionate about cat welfare.



“Can I see these things? Are they in the storage room upstairs?” She hesitated for a moment; it seemed like too much time was passing. ""The storage room is a mess right now, full of my study materials. Can I wait until after the exam to look at them?"" ""



I didn't press further.



About a month ago, Leona and her family came to my house for the weekend. I was nervous, worried about coming out, since we'd never actually met in person, but Leona assured me they'd like me.



They arrived Friday evening, shortly after sunset, around 7 p.m. Leona's parents, sister, and her eight-year-old nephew, Sam, were all there.



The first thing I noticed was that they all had the same sharp green eyes as Leona. As for Sam... Sam was a completely energetic little guy, radiating pure, chaotic energy.



As soon as they walked in, Sam started running. He circled our living room, squealing excitedly. He'd dash from one end of the apartment to the other and back again. He'd climb on the furniture. He'd jump from the sofa to the armchair. He knocked over a lamp, seemingly oblivious.



“Sam, quiet down,” his mother said gently, but without sounding worried.



“Has he always been this…energetic?” ""I asked cautiously.



""Oh, yes,"" said Leona's sister. ""He's so energetic for his age.They need a lot of stimulation.""



Sam dashed past us, leaped onto the back of the sofa despite being eight, then jumped down and continued running.



Leona didn't seem to mind at all. In fact, she joined in. I watched my girlfriend chase her nephew around the house, using both hands and feet. Sam squealed with delight and ran even faster.



The whole family watched with fascination, while I stood there, trying to process what was happening.



""They've always been very close,"" Leona's mother told me. Her tone was very steady and precise. ""Leona is very good with children, especially young ones."" About twenty minutes later, Sam finally tired himself out and surrendered by rolling on his back. He climbed onto Leona's lap, curled up, and immediately fell asleep. He had fallen asleep suddenly, halfway through our conversation. Leona gently stroked his hair, making her characteristic purring sounds, but he remained fast asleep.



""He can sleep for a few hours now,"" her sister said, sitting down on our sofa like all of them. ""Then he'll probably wake up around midnight.""



""Midnight?""



""He's very active at night. He sleeps most of the day. It's always been like that.""



Oh, of course.



They brought gifts. Leona's mother handed me a heavy bag. ""For you, dear. Welcome to our family.""



The bag contained several cans of expensive quail, several cans of olive oil-infused sardines, a bottle of mint liqueur, and a box of roast chicken.



""Thank you,"" I said, what else could I say? ""It's so thoughtful."" “We only buy the best,” her mother nodded. “We value quality.”



Dinner was interesting. Leona had prepared a lavish spread: roast chicken, poached salmon, confit duck—each dish cooked to perfection. But when her mother pulled the side dishes from the bag she'd brought, they were all meat. No vegetables, no starches, just meat and fish.



Everyone ate with their faces pressed against their plates. For a moment, Leona’s father licked his knife clean.



After dinner, as Leona cleared the table, I tried to chat with her sister.



“Sam’s got so much energy.”



“Oh, yes. He’s very healthy. Strong, fast, and has excellent reflexes.” Her tone held a clear pride. “He’s already showing the potential to be an excellent hunter.”



“A hunter?”



“A keen observer. He notices everything that moves. Once he’s focused on something, he can sit still for hours.” “She laughed. “He brought me a moth last week, and he was so proud of it.”



I was speechless for a moment.



As expected, Sam woke up around 11 p.m., immediately becoming energetic and running around again. It only took him two seconds to go from deep sleep to full wakefulness.



For the next hour, he climbed everything. The kitchen counter, the top of the refrigerator, the bookshelves—he climbed them all.



“Should he be there?” I asked anxiously. “It’s quite high.”



“He’s fine,” his mother said calmly. “He has excellent balance. He’s never fallen.”



“Never fallen?”



“Well, once, when he was very small. But he landed on all fours and barely scraped his skin.” ""



I didn't know what to say, so I went into the kitchen to get a drink of water and found Leona's father standing in front of the refrigerator, staring intently at the top. Just staring, motionless.



""Uh, sir...""



He turned around, and despite the bright kitchen light, his pupils dilated for a moment. Then they returned to normal, and he smiled. ""Sorry, dear. I think I saw something moving up there."" ""



There was nothing on top of the refrigerator.



Around one in the morning, Sam started to feel sleepy again. He climbed onto his sister Leona's lap, massaged her shoulders with his little hands for a few minutes, making a strange gurgling sound, and then immediately fell asleep.



That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept hearing various sounds coming from the guest room. Movements. Soft thumping. For a moment, I heard a scratching sound, like someone scratching wood or fabric with their fingernails.



The next morning, I woke up earlier than Leona and her sister. Sam was already awake, sitting on the windowsill in the living room, basking in the sunlight, motionless. He just sat there, face to the sun, eyes half-closed, looking very content.



He heard my voice and almost turned to look at me. He only turned his head slightly, his body still motionless facing the window.



""Good morning, Sam,"" I said, barely managing to.



""Good morning."" He responded cheerfully, then turned back to look at the sunlight.



Sunday evening, Leona's mother pulled me aside before they left.



""You're very good to our Leona,"" she said, looking at me with her sharp green eyes. ""You make her happy. You two smell perfect together.""



""I...thank you?""



As they left, Sam gave me a hug and then bumped my chin with his forehead—so hard it hurt a little. His mother smiled broadly.



""He likes you,"" she said. ""That's how he expresses his love.""



After they left, I noticed a dead moth on the coffee table, deliberately placed in the center, like some kind of offering.



Leona saw me looking at it. ""Sam is such a good boy,"" she said gently, picking up the moth and throwing it away. ""So thoughtful."" ""



The next few days were unusually calm.，and ""this"" happened.This happened on Saturday. That's why I'm posting this.



When Leona and I first started dating, we agreed on a ""separation day"" one day each month. On this day, we would each do our own thing. Maintaining independence, having personal time, and avoiding becoming the kind of couple who lose themselves in the relationship.



""Maintaining space is important,"" Leona said. ""Maintaining mystery. Having things that are only yours."" She said it then, but I should have noticed that she seemed especially happy every time I came back.



Because at the time, I thought it looked healthy and mature. We've been sticking to it for over a year.



Last Saturday was our separation day. I planned to go shopping with friends, have lunch, and then go to the movies. A typical Saturday. I left the apartment at noon, leaving a note for Leona on the bedside table: ""Separation day, going out! Will be back around 7 pm. Love you."" ""xx""



She was still fast asleep, radiating warmth like a furnace. I kissed her forehead and left.



I had a wonderful day. I went shopping with my friend Charlotte, had lunch at Nando's, browsed Boots trying out perfumes, and even watched a romantic comedy at the cinema that I barely remember. I got home just after six, feeling refreshed and in a good mood.



I opened the door and stepped on something wet and soft.



I looked down.



My foot was stuck in a fish head. A huge salmon head, with a lifeless eye staring at me. A pungent smell hit me—that stale, fishy smell.



I lifted my foot and looked around the rest of the apartment.



The living room floor was covered in catnip. Not just scattered bits, but the entire floor. It must weigh several pounds, covering the whole living room. It drifted into the kitchen and spread into the hallway. The smell was nauseating.



Scattered among the catnip were dozens of dead insects. Moths, beetles, spiders. They weren't scattered randomly, but arranged neatly. In rows, in circles, spiraling in a pattern. Clearly, it was a carefully designed design.



There were also more fish heads. Six in total, neatly arranged in a hexagon, encircling the living room. All facing inwards, mouths agape.



A dead snake lay on the coffee table. Several dead rats were neatly arranged on the windowsill. A large dragonfly was pinned to the wall, seemingly with thumbtacks, and feathers were scattered on the sofa. A pile of fish entrails lay in the center of the floor.



“Leona,” I called, my voice hoarse.



She immediately came out of the bedroom, her face turning deathly pale at the sight before her.



“Oh, no, I thought I had more time—”



“What is this?”



“I can explain. I was going to clean this up before you got back.”



“Clean up what? How did all this get here?” She looked like she was about to cry.



""Have you done this before?""



She nodded painfully. ""I thought there was at least another hour. You said seven, but I thought—""



""That doesn't explain why you did it.""



""Where did you get all this stuff?""



""Some I caught. Mice. snake And the insects I've been collecting aren't all dead; some I just killed today."" She said this as if everything was normal. ""The fish head was leftovers.""



""You ate the fish raw?""



She immediately started cleaning, still looking guilty and upset. She spent half an hour disposing of all the dead things, sucking up all the catnip, scrubbing the floor, and opening all the windows. She ordered Thai takeout as an apology. She hugged me, trying to make me understand what I had just seen.



""You should talk to someone, maybe a therapist?"" 



“You’re right,” she said softly. “I’m sorry.”

(New to Portland),"Hey guys, I’m looking for places in Portland/Lake Oswego where I can meet people and socialize over drinks or coffee. I’m pretty new to Oregon—only been here about three months, so I’m looking to make some friends and get more connected.

I like the chill, laid-back vibe of coffee shops and tap houses, but I’m looking for places where there’s more of a social scene, ideally where people in their late 20s/early 30s hang out and are open to conversation.

I’m particularly interested in fitness, ‘biohacking’, business, programming, and marketing, so anywhere people discuss those kinds of topics would be a plus, but I’m also just down for good tap houses or social spots where it’s easy to strike up conversations.

Outside of that, I love hiking, trying new restaurants (or hitting up the same spot 1000x), and I’m obsessed with burgers, Killer Burger has been my favorite so far. Can any other place beat it?

I’m 27, live in Lake Oswego, and open to driving into the city.

Any recommendations?

1qxu7xi,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1qxu7xi/this_is_my_first_chapter_would_you_keep_reading/,This is my first chapter. Would you keep reading? (Pulpy horror),"The gas station emerges from the darkness like something a dying man might hallucinate in the middle of the Colorado Desert. Three solitary pumps beneath a corrugated metal roof, their digital displays blinking red numbers into the moonless night.

  Eddie Kowalski kills the engine. He can hear everything now: the flutter of moths against fluorescent lights, the electric buzz of the neon sign announcing *76 Navajo Petroleum - 24 Hours*, the crickets and the dry whisper of wind through the sagebrush, his own breathing. Eighteen hours hauling copper cable from Phoenix to Denver and his eyes burn like he's  been staring at the sun. The caffeine stopped working hours ago and the yellow highway lines had started to blur.

  Stretching the aching muscles of his legs, he finally climbed down from the Peterbilt, feeling every one of his forty-seven years in his lower back. The New Mexico night air is cold,  carrying that smell of creosote that exists nowhere else. He's driven this route hundreds of times. Each time it was a bit worse.

  He'd parked the truck next to the pump at the far end, being careful not to have trouble with the trailer in the narrow entrance. His reflection in the rearview shows a fat man his wife no longer loves. She says she does, of course. But he knows better. She hasn't felt anything for him in years, even before he got fat. Probably before too.

  While the tank fills, he watches the store through dust-stained windows. A skinny kid in a visor cap reads a magazine behind the counter, lit by the pale glow of refrigerators full of drinks. Rows of processed snacks, bottles of Gatorade, rotisserie hot dogs that have been spinning since the Jurassic. Most things in there are probably eons past their expiration date.

  Just as he is.

  The pump clicks. Eddie hangs up the nozzle and heads toward the store, his boots striking the cracked concrete with thuds that bounce off the colorful walls. He needs coffee, some sugar, and maybe a thirty-second conversation with another human being before facing the remaining four hours to Denver.

  The door opens with the tinkle of a rusted bell.

  ""Evening,"" says the kid without looking up. Acne scars pock his sunken cheeks. His fingers are stained yellow with nicotine.

  ""Is the coffee fresh?""

  ""Made it an hour ago.""

  Eddie pours himself a large cup from the machine. The liquid is black as crude oil and smells burnt, but it's caffeine, and that's all that matters. He dumps five sugar packets into it and heads for the refrigerators.

  He passes the magazine rack, spotting the ones with the girls on them. Best not to look too much, maybe later. Tits were great, but he much preferred thinking about this stuff in privacy.

  That's when Kowalski hears it.

  A scratching sound, like something being dragged across concrete. Eddie stops, listening. It comes again, louder, followed by what could be a hiss, like steam coming out of an engine.

  ""Did you hear that?""

  ""What?""

  The sound repeats, this time clearly from the west side of the building.

  ""That.""

  The kid shrugs.

  ""Must be a coyote or maybe a rattler.""

  Eddie frowns. Definitely, none of those were the sources of the sound. Coyotes can't drag something that big, a rattlesnakes should be the size of a car to make such a noise when slithering.

  Hesitating, Eddie grabs a chocolate bar from the shelf and approaches the counter. The kid's eyes never leave his magazine: ""Twelve fifty.""

  Eddie pulls out a twenty, but before he can hand it over the lights flicker. Twice. Then they stabilize.

  ""Happens when it's windy. Generator doesn’t work for shit.""

  Eddie nods, pays and takes his change. Every instinct he has is screaming at him to get out of here, *now*.

  ""Night,"" he says, heading for the door.

  ""Nighty night.""

  Outside, his boots crunch on grit. He's halfway to his truck when he sees the marks on the ground.

  Serpentine trails in the sand coating the asphalt. He was right. Something massive had been dragged from behind the gas station. The track is too wide for it to have been a snake or any animal Eddie's seen, and there's something wet inside that gleams under the floodlights.

  He crouches, touches the substance with a finger. Viscous, mucus-like, thick. He felt a strange sensation where the liquid met his skin. When he raises his hand to the light, he sees the impossible. The deep, slashing scar on his fingertip—the one he’d had for as long as he could remember, result of a childhood fight accident with his brother. The greenish liquid had—

  Something moves in the darkness beyond the gas pumps.

  Eddie straightens slowly.

  It hisses. Something enormous slides over concrete. Eddie makes the first motion to back toward his truck.

  The head that comes out of the shadows freezes him where he stands.

  The scales shine like polished metal, reflecting the lights coming from the store. The eyes are the size of dinner plates, completely black except for vertical pupils that contract when they find him. But it's the mouth that makes Eddie's blood go below zero. Only God knows how many rows of kitchen-knive-sharp teeth fill those jaws.

  Eddie understands he's looking at a paranormal being. It has to exceed thirty feet, and it's as thick as an oil drum. The scales are missing in places, leaving muscle exposed beneath—tensed, glistening.

  A second head appears from the opposite side of the building. Then a third. And a fourth.

  Eddie runs.

  He quickly shoves the chocolate bar into his mouth, chewing wrapper and all, and the coffee spills scalding his hands. His boots pound the asphalt; he can hear the giant bodies sliding behind him, hisses as loud as an industrial boiler.

  Yanking open the driver's door, Eddie jumps into the cab. His fingers fumble for the keys on the dashboard, and something hits the side of the truck with the force of a battering ram.

  The Peterbilt rocks on its tires. One of the heads is pressed against the passenger window. The glass begins to give under the pressure, cracks spread like spider webs. The black eyes stare at him without blinking. The jaw dislocates, opening at an impossible angle, showing a throat that seems to lead into the darkest corner of hell.

  Eddie finds the keys. Turns the ignition. The diesel engine roars to life, but before he can shift into gear another snake strikes the windshield.

  The passenger window explodes inward in a rain of safety glass. The head pushes through, jaws wide, and Eddie can smell a nauseating mixture of rotting flesh and something chemical, antiseptic.

  He throws himself backward, clawing at the driver's door. The walls of the throat contract rhythmically, pink and wet, waiting to swallow him whole.

  The door opens and Eddie falls out, hitting the asphalt hard. Scrambling to his feet, he runs to the store, screaming something. Eddie's not sure what he is screaming, but he is.

  Over his shoulder, he can see they are not following. They've coiled around his truck instead, squeezing. The metal groans. The windshield shatters. The doors come out of their hinges.

  Eddie hits the store door at a run. ""Call the cops!"" he shouts. ""Call—""

  The kid is already frowning at the creatures destroying the truck. ""Come inside, man! What the fuck are those things?""

  Barely finishing the words, the fluorescent lights go out. The gas station plunges into darkness, broken only by the pale red glow of the digital numbers on the pump displays outside.

  Hisses come from everywhere at once, traveling through the concrete and climbing up Eddie's spine. Then the front window explodes in a cascade of fragments that gleam like diamonds.

  First of the heads pushes through. The jaw dislocates with a wet crack.

  The kid screams—high-pitched, almost girlish—and the sound cuts off when the snake lunges. The teeth close around his torso and Eddie hears the ribs snapping. Dry kindling snapping.

  Blood hits the wall behind the counter in a spray. The smell is immediate, copper and iron and the snake stench underneath, something like sulfur.

  Eddie runs for the back door but another head appears from the shadows ahead of him.

  The body moves with terrible grace. It strikes him from the side and he feels his ribs give way, an explosive pain that whites out his vision. He flies against the magazine rack, knocking down the porn catalogue and soda bottles that shatter around him in geysers of foam and glass. The smell is unbearable.

  He tries to stand, but the snake is already there.

  Teeth sink into his left shoulder. Eddie feels every fang piercing muscle, tendon, and bone. The pain is so intense his mind disconnects, refusing to process it.

  His arm detaches from the shoulder joint with a tearing sound. Eddie stares at the ragged stump where he used to have a limb almost with academic curiosity. Blood pulses out in rhythm with his heartbeat.

  A third snake enters through the window. He can hear its scales scraping against the broken glass. The first one has finished with the kid and is coming back as well, with pieces of the employee hanging from its teeth: strips of flesh that swing like party streamers, fragments of white bone that shine in the darkness.

  One of the two, could be either, coils around him and begins to squeeze.

  Eddie feels his bones splintering, sharp fragments driving into his muscles and his organs.

How can I salvage the friendship?,"(This got taken down so I’m giving it another shot. Everything is written by me - no ai or bot shenanigans.) Apologies for any formatting issues.

I (28F) have known Lindsey (30F) for 15 years - we met in high school, lived together in college, and although we now live in separate states we make an effort to see each other at least once a year, and keep our group chat with our other best friend Eden as active as possible. Lindsey hasn’t been lucky in love - she didn’t have boyfriends in college and went through a pretty rough situationship experience a few years ago with a guy she liked who didn’t want to be exclusive. She is incredibly smart, beautiful, hilarious and a complete catch, and up until recently I would consider her the most moralistic and fiercely loyal person I have ever met. Since we were teenagers I considered her to be like a sister to me, and a great friend. 

I met Eric (30M) in 2019 when I was 21 when we were both working at a coffee shop together. We had a whirlwind romance and genuinely loved being around each other. I struggled with drug and alcohol addiction at the time and ended up cheating on him, and then breaking up with him very soon after. I have since been to AA and SLAA, worked through each program, made amends to him and we were able to remain friendly. For the years following, we found ourselves in an on again off again relationship where the dynamic was ultimately him wanting more than I was capable of giving him at the time. His life orbited around me for years. He would visit me, we would spend days talking on the phone, and after flight school he moved to the midwest to take a job to be closer to me (we’re both originally from Los Angeles). We have been through the highest of highs and the lowest of lows together. We talked about getting married and spending our lives together, even naming our future children (as young twenty something’s do when they’re in love/limerence). I carried a lot of shame and guilt for popping in and out of his life for a long time. I hurt him by not wanting to be with him romantically but still holding onto the relationship because it felt safe and comfortable. 

The last time I saw him was August of 2024. He was living in Milwaukee and my friend Ella and I were in town for the state fair. He was in a year-long relationship at the time but wanted to hang out with Ella and I, so we met up for a few drinks. We hung out for a couple hours and then went our separate ways. The next morning he texted me that it was incredible seeing me and it made him realize how much he missed me and how he wanted to leave his girlfriend of a year to be with me. I told him I wasn’t interested and to please not sacrifice his year long relationship for me. The months following that he would text me from time to time and try to meet up with me when he was in Chicago and I would tell him I was busy. All that being said, I consider him my first love and a huge part of my early adult life. With *that being said*, I was happy to close the Eric chapter of my life for good, and no longer have him in my life in any way.

Lindsey has been there as a support for me since the day I met Eric. She was there for me during our break up and during every subsequent up and down of our relationship that followed. This is why what she did and how she went about it hurt me so much.

Yesterday 6:52 PM

**Linds**: Do you have time to talk tn? I need to tell you about something that is really joyful in a lot of ways but a little weird in other ways

**Me**: Omg aw wait I wanna hear

\[I sent her a picture of my boyfriend John and Ella at Olive Garden\]

I don’t really know what to say. It has been unexpected for me also. Obviously I realize this is weird in a lot of ways and that’s part of why ive been so anxious and unable to tell you like right when it happened

But I also feel happy for the first time in a very long time and I like him so much so I just feel like I can’t turn back now

**Me**: How long has it been going on for

I guess idk why you wouldn’t even tell me you guys were hanging platonically like why hide that

**Linds**: We hung out two times as friends in December before I left for maui and then when I got back in January it turned romantic and just seemed to snowball extremely fast

I don’t actually know why I didn’t tell you I hung out with him as friends I guess I didn’t want to hurt your feelings because I know you had a bad breakup but yeah I should have told you and im sorry I didn’t

Just to be clear - I do NOT have any lingering feelings towards Eric. My upset at this is purely because of Lindsey’s betrayal and her hiding it from me, and then her nonchalant/flippant way of breaking the news to me. She came at it less like she was remorseful for going behind my back and more so like she was excited to have a crush on a boy and I should be happy for her. I am in a healthy and happy relationship and I have worked incredibly hard on myself and taken the steps I needed to take in order to get where I am, but I still believe that I have a right to be upset about this. My partner and my other friends (who all know Lindsey and some know Eric) are being incredibly supportive and are shocked that her of all people would cross such a major friendship boundary like this. I am feeling a mixture of shock, sadness, and disappointment and feel as though I am now grieving a 15 year old friendship. I feel as though Eric is having an easier time justifying this to himself as I betrayed his trust in our relationship. But from my point of view - that was 7 years ago and we continued to see each other for 3 years after that. I do understand how he could have lingering feelings of resentment. As for Lindsey, I feel as though she has no excuse - other than she “really” likes him I guess.

Some more context of the situation that keeps replaying in my head (sorry again for formatting):

She visited me in Chicago last September and went on and on about how her friend in NYC had hooked up with a guy she had previously hooked up with and liked. She told me about her friend: “there’s a million guys in this city, why do you have to hook up with the same one I did”. She was very upset and annoyed at her friend.

I was the one who introduced them. When Eric and I were in one of our ‘on again’ phases a few years ago, he visited NYC and I told him he should meet up with one of my best friends because I thought they’d get along.

I am no-contact with my birth mother due to childhood trauma. When Lindsey went home for Christmas she texted me and asked me if it was alright for her to visit my mother, to which I said “yes of course” and gave her my blessing. So she obviously knows how to go about this kind of situation the right way.

Everyone I have spoken to about this situation is incredibly baffled because of how un-Lindsey like this is.

I truly truly just cannot wrap my mind around why anyone would want to date someone who was pining after/in love with their best friend for YEARS. I truly do not understand that at all.

The whole thing is really just taking a toll on me. I feel like I’m losing a friend. Has anyone gone through anything similar and been able to remain friends with the person? I don’t know how I could continue to be her friend while she’s dating my ex. I’d love some insight or support.",7,1770412638.0,relationship_advice,14,0.73,False

# Short Review

I didn’t really need another coffee machine, but the all-in-one setup and design convinced me. It handles espresso, drip coffee, and cold brew well, and having the grinder, scale, and frother built in makes the whole process easier than expected. It feels more practical than flashy.

I mostly use it for espresso and occasional cold brew, and so far it’s been consistent. It does take up some counter space, but it looks clean enough that I don’t mind leaving it out.

Pros: All-in-one setup, clean design, easy workflow  
Cons: Large footprint, not cheap

Overall:  
Not something I urgently needed, but it looks good on the counter and actually gets used. A solid choice if you want fewer devices and a cleaner coffee setup.",1,1770412578.0,HonestFinds,0,1.0,False

Things were mostly normal until Ethan got really into “spiritual optimization TikTok.”

At first it was harmless. Cold showers. Journaling. Saying things like “this coffee feels anxious.” Whatever.

Then he decided our relationship had negative energy because we once argued about queso.

Last weekend we were at a crowded outdoor mall. I was wearing my AirPods (important later). Ethan suddenly stopped walking, grabbed my wrist, and said, “We need to do this now. The universe is aligned.”

Before I could ask what “this” was, he pulled one of my AirPods out of my ear and sprinted toward a decorative fountain.

I chased him, yelling his name, while he shouted back, “This is for us!”

He then fully submerged both AirPods into the fountain, holding them above his head like Simba, and started whispering affirmations. People were filming.

I lost it. I told him to stop, that those were $200 AirPods, and that water is famously bad for electronics. He said material attachment was the real problem and that if I loved him, I’d let go.

I told him if he loved me, he’d stop trying to drown my property.

He refused. A mall security guard came over. Ethan told the guard this was a “private spiritual ceremony.” The guard did not agree.

At this point Ethan knelt down, dipped the AirPods back into the water, and said, “Be reborn.”

I called the non-emergency police line because I genuinely did not know what else to do and he would not give them back.

The cops came. Ethan told them he was being persecuted for his beliefs. The cops asked if the AirPods were mine. I said yes. They told Ethan to hand them over. He cried. Loudly.

Now Ethan says I humiliated him, traumatized him spiritually, and “chose capitalism over love.” His friends are texting me saying I escalated too fast and should’ve “trusted the process.”

I ordered coffee at a Tim Hortons drive through location in Brampton today, and as the employee was handing the coffee over and I grabbed it, it spilled all over my legs, groin area and my car seat. The **lid was not closed properly.**

The coffee was HOT and my thighs were burning. My car seat reeks of coffee.

The employee said sorry while it happened and then went to grab a new coffee?! Instead of handing over the napkins to clean as we had requested. Had to ask again and finally gave it. 

The manager came over and I asked for a refund of my items and they took the items back!? I had to clarify I am asking for a refund while still wanting to keep what I ordered.

Anyways, I later went inside the store because my thighs were will stinging and had to show them the mess on my pants. They just kept saying sorry. I still took the manager’s name down and got the location’s #.

My thighs are still stinging and I have small red marks. I understand burn marks do not appear until later.

I want them to cover the damages to my pants and my car - what else can they be held responsible for?

PLEASE HELP.,"I met a guy on app. For hookups. From the beginning, there was strong mutual attraction and sex was great. and later he asked me after 2 weeks if I would be open for something serious and I said yes.

we agreed we were both looking for something serious and monogamous. He asked me if i would be open to meet his parents someday. I told him, I am not out to my family and few straight friends, but I do have gay friends where I am fully out and would love him to be part of it. He said, he doesnt want to be part of my straight life but its ok with me to have two lives as long as i respect him. He was heading to.m back home in a month after we met, and he told me “i hope I dont loose you in the process of moving my place and going back home and i hope you will be patient  with me” I told him, I will wait for you as long as you give me a reason to wait for you, i dont want you to come back and say oh I dont feel the same anymore” then I dont want to waste my time. He said no, I am very much interested in you.

The first couple of months were intense but positive: frequent dates, weekly routine for 5 months amazing sexual chemistry, emotional openness, future-oriented conversations, and consistent effort from both sides. He often said things like we have so much “potential,” that I was “perfect for him, not just sexually bit our values matches, and that he wanted a long-term relationship. His parents marriage was a goal for him.

I asked him about his past relationships the first time he asked me out and From what he shared, his past relationships followed a similar pattern. He has dated people he felt strong attraction toward, but those relationships ended once deeper issues surfaced. In one case, he said he “fell out of love” after several months. In another, he ended things because he felt hidden or not fully chosen by his partner. He described having met “good guys” before but still feeling unsure.

Early on, we also had a very open conversation about expectations, communication, and past relationship insecurities. He said he appreciated the clarity and that it made him feel safe. Which he it took 6-7 months to get to this conversation in his past relationship.

Around month 3–4, things started to change. As the relationship became more emotionally real, he began expressing confusion about his feelings and whether he felt enough “spark” or attraction, even though his behavior (seeing each other regularly, initiating plans, sex, affection) largely stayed the same. He oscillated between wanting to keep trying and feeling overwhelmed.

I had to go back home as my mom was in hospital and this time, I asked him to be patient with me and he cried while I was leaving and he said yes I will wait.

When I came back after a week. He questioned the concern of me being closeted and He said he doesnt feel spark and butterflies. He broke up with me

I agreed to coming out to my parents in near future and assured him that I will not leave his side and I am serious about him. I even took a small step coming out to my roommate who is my very good friend to show my seriousness. We got back together

During this period, I became more anxious because of the inconsistency, while still trying to give space and be patient. He acknowledged he was confused, said something might be “wrong with him,” and that he wanted the relationship to work but didn’t know if he could give what I needed.

We broke up once, reconciled briefly, and then broke up again after about 5 months. During the final breakup, he said that although I was an “8/10” and a great partner, he felt life was too short not to look for a “10/10,” and that he wasn’t sure the attraction was enough long-term. He emphasized that I did nothing wrong.

After the breakup, he appeared calm and emotionally detached, returned to dating apps quickly, and blocked me there. When we met once for coffee. he was friendly and relaxed but firm that he didn’t want to continue. I, on the other hand, am struggling with a lot of grief, confusion, and hurt, especially around how someone could feel so certain after months of closeness.

There are much more details in this but this is the shortest I could write and try to fit major information. He was crying during these hard conversations and was seen overwhelmed and confused.

I tried my best to have soft and open communication and tried to show him we can work through and we can take things slow or the way he wants but he has to communicate rather end it.

I’m trying to understand whether this was mainly about attraction, emotional readiness, attachment differences, or something else — and how to make sense of the mismatch between how close the relationship felt and how decisively it ended.

I dont know what happened, it was all good. He even said even though he had longest relationship of 8 months with his ex. With me he had the smoothest non toxic relationship (5 months).

I am so confused and he seems so fine and moved on. He seem to be happy unbothered.

next week is the last of the transitional day program and i had estimated i'd be able to start studying when it was over.  i think i will be.  i think i'm back to a level of functioning where it's realistic for me to expect i'll be able to retain at least some information.  if i were able to get that job at the cafe and study after work for my exams, it would be perfect and make me so happy.  i'm also planning to start getting my license this summer because every job here requires transportation.  it's something i've avoided my entire adult life.  i've never had the confidence for it and i've been able to get around it but i can't anymore.

I'm looking into treatment today. Residential if possible, though I realistically can only go for a couple weeks, and then either PHP or IOP, depending what works with school.

They had other information inaccurate, and in other cases they've simply made stuff up and tried to blame things on me for being drunk when I was stone cold sober. They tried that this time, too.

1qxtx40,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qxtx40,Club Penguin Journey Third Anniversary Party Secret Agent Scavenger Hunt! (SPOILERS!),"Club Penguin Journey's Third Anniversary Party has officially kicked off! The island has been transformed into a grand throwback of parties from the last year with a ton of great moments being showcased for everyone to see.

However, there is more coming than what meets the eye. Upon some digging, it appears there will be a secret agent twist coming into play later during the party.

There will be a secret agent themed scavenger hunt that starts sometime during the party with a tour guide hat icon taking you to a scavenger hunt interface. You will be prompt to collect different items across the island related to this secret agent crossover.

Currently, we can see that tour guide hat icon in the Town and Coffee Shop, with some mysterious symbols scattered across the floor in the Coffee Shop. I wonder what it could all mean?

There has also been an update in the EPF Command Room, with secret agent text being displayed on screen.

The decoded text on screen reads,

>*MONITORING PERSISTENT TECHNICAL ISSUES REGARDING THE ISLAND'S TOURBOTS*  
*THREAT LEVEL: LOW*  
*SUBJECT TO CHANGE*  
*COMM: PENDING*  
*TACT: ACTIVE TECH: ACTIVE*  
*SLTH: STANDBY*  
*EPU: STANDBY*  
  
*ALL AGENTS ON STANDBY*

Whatever it could be, something is definitely bound to happen soon. With the Tour Bots text malfunctioning, the Tour Guide icon being present in the Town and Coffee Shop alongside those weird symbols on the floor...what do you think is in store?

Honestly seeing some decent results - energy feels more stable throughout the day and I'm not reaching for that second (or third) cup like before. The crash thing has definitely improved. But I'm wondering if I'm leaving results on the table here.

Seen some people mention they do better splitting it between two cups or even doing 1.5 packets. Anyone experimented with timing or dosage adjustments? Also curious if the type of coffee matters - I usually do medium roast but wondering if dark roast would work better with whatever's in this stuff.

However years prior I went to see a psychologist and took the wais-iv, iva-cpt, and maybe something else? working memory was like 95 and average and the iva-cpt said i had average visual focus(lots of results but that was the gist of it) and impaired auditory focus... thing is both tests say you can't conclusively diagnose with them?

but maybe thats just saying its up to the discretion of the practitioner themselves? Issue is that, I do have hearing loss. And visual focus was fine. I remember needing to click on things for the exam but i don't know if the scores are adjusted for hearing loss. (yeah i am not filtering out alot of sounds and I know I don't).

I've never been on any meds. Coffee makes it harder for me to focus sometimes(i feel spaced out sometimes? maybe its more anxiety idk), instead of better focused. I don't really have issues focusing when in a conversation or when i'm in class either.

Then this at the end: ""There were three Response Control Primary scales that fell in the substantially impaired range. The global Full Scale Attention quotient scale score fell in average range. One scale (Auditory Steadiness) measuring omission errors showed that (name) had significant attentional deficits.""

(visual had no impairment)

I barely remember the test, but I did have to wear headphones. If some of that test relied on directional hearing or being able to hear out both ears it would explain alot.

???

And I didn't mention alot of the focus issues with the psychiatrist since at the time I saw them I was managing things alright. Like to-do lists and such? Failed some classes, partially cause of procrastination though. So idk how to fix this. I had other issues i needed to bring up that wasn't focus though.",3,1770411673.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

**\[{LoserVirgin!User X BadBoy!Char}\]**

James, the golden-boy pharmacy student, convinces his devoted best friend you to publicly pose as his girlfriend. His goal is simple: make his ex, Carly, regret leaving him and realize she wants him back.

Your Secret: You’ve been quietly in love with James for years. You agree, not for the scheme, but for the fleeting chance to finally be close to him, even under false pretenses. Your love is entirely one-sided and painfully real.

To the university, they are the perfect “best-friends-to-lovers” story. Their “relationship” is performative—all staged touches, strategic appearances, and photos meant to be seen by Carly.

In private, James is distracted, constantly texting or talking about Carly. You are his emotional confidante about the very person they are pretending to replace, twisting the knife of their own unrequited feelings.

# [ R O W A N ]

Rowan, a guarded and intimidating figure, initially treats you with cold disdain, seeing them as part of James's privileged, fake world.

This protectiveness morphs into a dark, possessive fixation. Rowan doesn't comfort; he covets. He positions himself in the shadows, watching the cracks in James's facade, waiting to claim you when the fake relationship inevitably implodes.

Rowan wasn’t competing. He was a vulture circling, waiting for the entire fragile arrangement to collapse. He saw you not as a player in the game, but as the prize being carelessly tossed around. And when James inevitably dropped them to run back to Carly, Rowan’s dark, patient gaze promised he would be there to pick up the pieces—not to mend them, but to claim them.

# [ Y O U R   R O L E ]

You are caught in an impossible triangle: pining for the man using them, while becoming the obsession of the man watching them break. You’re the puppy that trails after James through crowded hallways and late-night study sessions, always one step behind, always hoping. You tell yourself it’s loyalty. Everyone else sees desperation.

You sit beside him in class. You bring him coffee when he’s tired. You laugh at jokes that aren’t funny and listen when he talks about Carly like it doesn’t hollow you out.

You think if you stay long enough—if you prove how dependable, how patient, how good you are—he’ll finally turn around and see you.

So you wait. Quietly. Faithfully.

Begging without ever opening your mouth.

For a chance that was never yours to begin with.

# [ K E Y  P L A Y E R S ]

James is the knowing catalyst, so focused on winning back his past that he's blind to the real love in front of him and the danger he's attracting.

Rowan is the inevitable consequence, a force of nature representing a raw, demanding, and potentially consuming form of love that stands in stark contrast to James's careless usage.

Carly is the perpetual specter, the reason for the lie and the source of public venom.

Miles keeps the fraternity visible and desirable. He organizes parties, handles invites, keeps girls coming, and makes sure rumors work in their favor. He’s loud where Rowan is silent, charming where Rowan is cold. He’s also the one who knows everyone’s secrets.



• Ethan Cross — Rowan’s sparring partner; the only one who can last more than three rounds with him.

• Lucas Hale — Handles Phi Kappa Psi finances; Rowan once saved him from getting jumped off-campus. Legacy brother who underestimated Rowan once and never did again.

• Andre Washington — Pre-law, Rowan’s quiet backup during confrontations.

• Jared Kim — Tech genius; runs the frat’s private group chats and deletes evidence on Rowan’s command.

1qxtskm,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1qxtskm/aita_for_cutting_off_my_family_financially_after/,AITA for cutting off my family financially after my dad demanded $12K for my brother's tuition when I've already sent them $40K in 3 years?,"My dad looked me dead in the eyes at New Year's dinner and said, ""You'll be paying for your brother's tuition now. Twelve thousand dollars. You must.""

I was mid-bite of turkey when he said it. Just announced it like I didn't have a choice. My fork was still in my hand when I put it down, picked up my wine glass, and clinked it against my plate. Hard.

""You shouldn't live at my expense,"" I said. Loud enough that my aunt stopped talking. ""So I won't be sending you any more money. This family will no longer receive money from me.""

My mom's fork hit her plate with a clang. My brother went pale and whispered, ""Wait, what?""

Here's the thing. I've been bankrolling my parents for three years. Their mortgage. Their car payments. My brother's community college expenses. Even their fucking groceries half the time because my dad ""retired early"" at 52 and my mom only works part-time at a nail salon.

I make good money. I'm a software engineer and I worked my ass off to get where I am. Paid my own way through state school with loans and two jobs. Nobody helped me. But the second I graduated and got my first real paycheck, my dad started with the ""family takes care of family"" speeches.

At first it was small. A few hundred here and there. Then it became their mortgage payment every month. Then the car. Then my brother's tuition because ""he's struggling and you had it easy with your scholarships.""

I didn't have it easy. I had scholarships because I busted ass for a 4.0 while working nights at Target and weekends at a coffee shop. My brother plays video games sixteen hours a day and failed out of his first semester twice.

But I paid it anyway. Because I thought maybe I was being selfish. Maybe I should help.

Then tonight happened.

My dad didn't ask. He told me. Like I was an ATM machine he'd just decided to withdraw from. My brother sat there smirking like he'd already spent the money. My mom nodded along like this was completely reasonable.

""You make plenty,"" my dad said. ""Your brother needs this degree to get a real job. You can afford it.""

""Can I though?"" I said. My voice was shaking but I kept going. ""Because last I checked, I pay your mortgage. I paid for your new transmission last month. I bought your groceries on Christmas Eve because you said you were short.""

My aunt was staring. My uncle had stopped eating entirely.

""That's what family does,"" my mom said. Quietly. Like she was embarrassed I was bringing it up.

""No,"" I said. ""That's what YOU expect ME to do. When's the last time any of you helped me? When I had to get my roof fixed after that storm? When my car broke down? Nobody offered me a dime. But I'm supposed to just hand over twelve grand because you decided it?""

My brother finally spoke up. ""Come on, you don't even need that money. You make like six figures.""

""You don't know what I make,"" I snapped. ""You've never asked. You've never asked about my life at all except when you want something from it.""

My dad's face went red. ""We raised you. Clothed you. Fed you. You owe us.""

And that's when I lost it.

""I don't owe you shit,"" I said. I stood up. My chair scraped against their dining room floor. ""You did the bare minimum legally required of parents. You didn't pay for my college. You didn't help me move. You didn't come to my graduation. But you cashed every check I sent you and asked for more.""

My mom started crying. The silent kind where tears just roll down and she doesn't make a sound.

""I've sent you over forty thousand dollars in three years,"" I said. My hands were shaking. ""Forty. Thousand. Dollars. And you didn't say thank you once. You just asked for more. Every single time.""

""Where are you getting these numbers?"" my dad said. Like I was making it up.

I pulled out my phone. Opened my banking app. Started reading out loud. ""March 2022, $1,800 mortgage. April 2022, $1,800 mortgage. May 2022, $1,800 mortgage plus $600 for car insurance. June...""

""Stop,"" my mom said.

""Why?"" I said. ""You want me to pay but you don't want to hear what it costs me? I had to push back buying a house because I'm paying for yours. I haven't taken a vacation in two years because every spare dollar goes to keeping you afloat. And you just demanded twelve thousand more like it's nothing.""

My uncle cleared his throat. ""Maybe we should all calm down.""

""No,"" I said. ""I'm done calming down. I'm done being the family bank. You want money? Get a job. Dad, you're 52, not 80. Mom, work full time. Brother, get loans like I did or get a job and pay for it yourself.""

My brother stood up. ""You're being a selfish bitch.""

My dad didn't correct him. That told me everything.

I grabbed my coat and my purse. ""I'm selfish? I'm selfish for not wanting to fund your entire life while you sit around doing nothing? Here's what's going to happen. I'm not sending any more money. Not for the mortgage, not for the car, not for groceries, not for tuition. Nothing. You're all adults. Figure it out.""

My mom was full-on sobbing now. ""You're going to let us lose our house?""

""You're going to lose your house because you spent three years spending my money instead of getting your shit together,"" I said. ""That's not on me. That's on you.""

I left. Got in my car and sat there shaking for ten minutes before I could even start the engine.

My phone's been blowing up since I got home. My dad's calling me ungrateful and cruel. My mom's sending paragraphs about how I'm abandoning them. My brother sent me one text that just said ""hope you're happy ruining our lives.""

My aunt texted me privately. Said she didn't know I'd been supporting them like that. Said my dad told everyone I was just ""helping out a little here and there"" and that I offered. Said she's proud of me for standing up for myself but the family's pissed.

I blocked my parents and my brother. I'm not answering anymore. But I keep thinking about my mom crying and I feel sick.

They're going to lose the house. My brother's going to have to drop out or take loans. My dad's going to have to get a job he hates. And it's because I said no.

Part of me feels like I just destroyed my family over money. Like maybe I should've just paid it and kept the peace. They raised me. They're my family. And now they're calling me selfish and heartless and maybe they're right.

Am I wrong for cutting them off?

I’m looking for suggestions for retirement gift ideas for a true inspiration who I work with. I would like to try and keep this as private as I can but due changes out of everyones control, someone who I’ve known for a couple of years now through school and work has chosen to retire and be with family.

I know Jehovahs witnesses cannot accept holiday related gifts but they can accept personal mile stone gifts. If this is incorrect information please let me know and remove the post if necessary. I do not intend for my lack of religious knowledge to offend anyone ❤️

 I was thinking maybe writing a thank you card and a couple small items. I have about a week to pull this together as I was informed shortly of their leave. He has been a custodian for years now so maybe some funny gifts related to that? or anything that is of importance to Jehovahs witnesses that is acceptable from someone outside of their religion and direct family. 

They have considerable me to be a “grandchild” as I am friend of a friend of their grandchild, not sure if that helps any. But they truly have worked hard for many years and deserve their retirement and I want them to feel seen.

IS THIS FEARFUL AVOIDANT OR JUST NOT INTERESTED,"I am (M 28) and he is (M29) I met this  guy on app. For hookups. From the beginning, there was strong mutual attraction and sex was great. and later he asked me after 2 weeks if I would be open for something serious and I said yes.

we agreed we were both looking for something serious and monogamous. He asked me if i would be open to meet his parents someday. I told him, I am not out to my family and few straight friends, but I do have gay friends where I am fully out and would love him to be part of it. He said, he doesnt want to be part of my straight life but its ok with me to have two lives as long as i respect him. He was heading to.m back home in a month after we met, and he told me “i hope I dont loose you in the process of moving my place and going back home and i hope you will be patient  with me” I told him, I will wait for you as long as you give me a reason to wait for you, i dont want you to come back and say oh I dont feel the same anymore” then I dont want to waste my time. He said no, I am very much interested in you.

The first couple of months were intense but positive: frequent dates, weekly routine for 5 months amazing sexual chemistry, emotional openness, future-oriented conversations, and consistent effort from both sides. He often said things like we have so much “potential,” that I was “perfect for him, not just sexually bit our values matches, and that he wanted a long-term relationship. His parents marriage was a goal for him.

I asked him about his past relationships the first time he asked me out and From what he shared, his past relationships followed a similar pattern. He has dated people he felt strong attraction toward, but those relationships ended once deeper issues surfaced. In one case, he said he “fell out of love” after several months. In another, he ended things because he felt hidden or not fully chosen by his partner. He described having met “good guys” before but still feeling unsure.

Early on, we also had a very open conversation about expectations, communication, and past relationship insecurities. He said he appreciated the clarity and that it made him feel safe. Which he it took 6-7 months to get to this conversation in his past relationship.

Around month 3–4, things started to change. As the relationship became more emotionally real, he began expressing confusion about his feelings and whether he felt enough “spark” or attraction, even though his behavior (seeing each other regularly, initiating plans, sex, affection) largely stayed the same. He oscillated between wanting to keep trying and feeling overwhelmed.

I had to go back home as my mom was in hospital and this time, I asked him to be patient with me and he cried while I was leaving and he said yes I will wait.

When I came back after a week. He questioned the concern of me being closeted and He said he doesnt feel spark and butterflies. He broke up with me

I agreed to coming out to my parents in near future and assured him that I will not leave his side and I am serious about him. I even took a small step coming out to my roommate who is my very good friend to show my seriousness. We got back together

During this period, I became more anxious because of the inconsistency, while still trying to give space and be patient. He acknowledged he was confused, said something might be “wrong with him,” and that he wanted the relationship to work but didn’t know if he could give what I needed.

We broke up once, reconciled briefly, and then broke up again after about 5 months. During the final breakup, he said that although I was an “8/10” and a great partner, he felt life was too short not to look for a “10/10,” and that he wasn’t sure the attraction was enough long-term. He emphasized that I did nothing wrong.

After the breakup, he appeared calm and emotionally detached, returned to dating apps quickly, and blocked me there. When we met once for coffee. he was friendly and relaxed but firm that he didn’t want to continue. I, on the other hand, am struggling with a lot of grief, confusion, and hurt, especially around how someone could feel so certain after months of closeness.

There are much more details in this but this is the shortest I could write and try to fit major information. He was crying during these hard conversations and was seen overwhelmed and confused.

I tried my best to have soft and open communication and tried to show him we can work through and we can take things slow or the way he wants but he has to communicate rather end it.

I’m trying to understand whether this was mainly about attraction, emotional readiness, attachment differences, or something else — and how to make sense of the mismatch between how close the relationship felt and how decisively it ended.

I dont know what happened, it was all good. He even said even though he had longest relationship of 8 months with his ex. With me he had the smoothest non toxic relationship (5 months).

I am so confused and he seems so fine and moved on. He seem to be happy unbothered.

1qxtllz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Alternative_Plate_14/comments/1qxtllz/i_couldnt_track_my_expenses_for_years_heres_what/,"I couldn’t track my expenses for years, here’s what finally worked.","# 

For a long time, I thought I was “bad with money”.

I tried spreadsheets.  
I tried budgeting apps.  
I even tried writing expenses in Notes.

Nothing stuck.

The real issue wasn’t discipline   
Money happens fast: coffee with friends, shared rent, random subscriptions, trips. By the time I opened a spreadsheet, the moment was already gone.

That frustration is actually what pushed me to rethink **how people track money**, and weirdly enough, it also shaped how I create content now.

Here’s what I learned, step by step.



# 1. Tracking fails when it interrupts real life

Most advice assumes people sit down once a week and “review finances”.

That’s not how real life works.

Spending happens:

* while talking
* while walking
* while splitting with friends
* while tired

The first shift that helped me: **track in the moment, not later**.

That’s why tools that remove friction matter.  
For example, using something like **Quassama**, where you can quickly add an expense (even by voice), made tracking feel like sending a message — not doing accounting.

Once friction dropped, consistency followed.



# 2. You don’t need more categories — you need visibility

I used to overcomplicate things:

* 20 categories
* weekly summaries
* fancy charts

It made me quit every time.

What actually helped:

* Seeing **who I spent with**
* Seeing **what was shared vs personal**
* Seeing **what kept repeating**

When I simplified tracking and focused on clarity instead of perfection, I finally understood where my money was going.

That insight alone reduced overspending without “trying harder”.



# 3. Shared expenses are where most people lose control

This was a big one for me.

Rent.  
Trips.  
Food.  
Subscriptions.

Money gets blurry when it’s shared, and that blur creates:

* tension
* avoidance
* “I’ll deal with it later” energy

Having a simple way to track shared expenses in one place (again, tools like Quassama helped here) removed the mental load and the awkward conversations.",1,1770411231.0,u_Alternative_Plate_14,0,1.0,False

Tony sat in his single kitchen chair, at a small table as he scrolled through his phone absent mindedly. 

The drizzle and hiss of the coffee maker filled the small kitchen with sound.

Tony sniffed the aroma of roasted coffee, pondering his job and upcoming tasks for the day.

The coffee pot went silent as Tony approached, preparing himself a thermal travel cup as he stared out his small dusty window to his work place.

Parked in his dead grass. 

An Ice Cream Truck. Clean with cartoonish design.

Tony could hear the faint echoes of whispered conversation and metal clanking from his basement as he stepped outside. Locking his home before heading to the back of the Ice Cream Truck.

He opened the doors, staring inside his cage for the next 12 hours.

Fluorescent lights stung his eyes. Shining down on the rest of the truck.

Cash register, soft serve machine, storage units, as well as one wall with a swing open door.

On the other was one huge marker board.

Always with his daily task already scrawled across it.

""No selling ""Tony's Infamous Orange Pops"" Today""



He groaned in defeat as he shut the doors. climbing into the driver's seat.

Memories of times when he didn't follow the daily rule. The ""Punishments"".

The first time his porch caught fire after he was asleep for the night.

Another time he failed to follow the daily rule his dog, only four years old.

She had a sudden and deadly stroke.

He didn't want to find out what would happen if he failed again.



No big deal, he decided. He didn't need to sell any of his special pops today. 

He cleared the worry from his mind, he loved his job.

He remembered the sound of children whispering in his basement. 

The sound of their chains clanking against the floor. 

He waved to his neighbors with a wide grin as he pulled onto the road.

He kept his smile. He had enough, he could just focus on making some cash for today.

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking to GM this story, I’d love it if you contributed as well! Be it brainstorming, playing a side character from time to time, you name it. That way we both will enjoy this roleplay to the fullest (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

(I'd also be open to a similar roleplay inspired by ""Bride's story"" :3)

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

**About you:**

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don’t want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let’s brainstorm them together!*
- *Be excited! Yeah, another cheesy one. Yet, I find it so fun to see an enthusiastic reply!*

- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

**About me:**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you’ll understand <3

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

**About you:**

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don’t want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let’s brainstorm them together!*
- *Be excited! Yeah, another cheesy one. Yet, I find it so fun to see an enthusiastic reply!*

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Anyway, that is all from me, I believe. If you are interested, perhaps have some questions, feel free to poke your head in my DMs! Hopefully hear from you soon!",1,1770410618.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False
1qxtber,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenPakistani/comments/1qxtber/winner_from_outside_failure_from_inside/,"Winner from outside, Failure from inside","Okay… so what if you love a girl so much that she becomes your whole world… but one day you realize she never really knew your worth?
Khair… let’s go back to where it all started.
When I met her she was the nicest girl I had ever seen. For me, she wasn’t just pretty she was perfect. A 10/10 in every possible way.
She wasnt just my girl… she was my best friend, my partner, my safe place, my peace… my breath.
My day started with her and ended with her.
Every small thing reminded me of her.
I used to think about her 24/7.
It felt like my mind didn’t belong to me anymore  it belonged to her.
I wasn’t living for myself… I was living for us.
I used to grind the whole night  improving my skills, doing uni work, practicing CTFs  just so I could give her my evenings, because she slept early.
I sacrificed my sleep, my rest, my health… and honestly, I didn’t even care.
Because loving her felt worth everything.
But life… life doesn’t stay like movies.
Things slowly started breaking.
I used to come 2nd, 3rd, 4th in competitions. I was trying my best, giving everything… but first place just kept slipping away.
And instead of supporting me… she started scolding me.
“Puri raat kya ghaas khodte ho?”
“You can’t even get first?”
“Others can win, why can’t you?”
Every word hit me like a knife.
People think words are small.
They’re not.
Sometimes words cut deeper than anything.
Coming second already hurts… you already feel like you failed yourself.
And then the person you love the most makes you feel even smaller…
That pain is different.
It makes you doubt yourself.
Your talent.
Your worth.
Your existence.
Still… I told her, “InshaAllah, I’ll get first. Just for you.”
Not for me.
For her.
I worked like crazy.
Day and night.
Skipped meals.
Cold lunch boxes stayed untouched.
Coffee became my only food.
Dark circles under my eyes.
Hands shaking from stress.
But in my head there was only one picture…
Winning…
Holding that trophy…
And saying, “This is for you.”
Competition day came.
I remember my hands shaking while holding my coffee.
Stress was so much that the cup was literally spilling.
I prayed.
I tried.
I fought.
But life isn’t a movie.
Again…
Second place.
I choked at one challenge something I could normally solve easily.Even today it feels like a curse. Like my brain just stopped working.
When they announced results, my heart felt so heavy… like someone dropped a mountain on my chest.
I stood up… and my legs gave up.
I didn’t lose a competition that day.
I lost myself.
When I told her…
She didn’t say “it’s okay”.
She didn’t say “I’m proud of you”.
She called me a failure.
“How can I live with someone who can’t even win a simple tournament?”
Failure.
That word kept echoing.
Failure.
Failure.
Failure.
As if my whole existence had no value.
Still… like an idiot in love… I travelled 350 km just to see her. Just to apologize. Just to promise her I’ll work harder.
Imagine that.
Apologizing for trying your best.
She made me wait outside for 1.5 hours.
Alone. Like a stranger.
Then when I finally met her…
She didn’t hug me.
She didn’t even look at me like before.
She insulted me in ways I can’t even describe.
Every sentence was humiliation.
Every word was poison.
She called me useless.
Said I had no future.
No goals.
No value.
Like I was nothing.
Like all the nights I stayed awake… meant nothing.
Like all the love I gave… meant nothing.
That day…
I didn’t cry like a man.
I cried like a child.
The kind of crying where your chest hurts and you can’t breathe.
Something inside me died that day.
After that…
I left everything.
CTFs.
Competitions.
My team.
My passion.
The thing that once gave me identity…
Gone.
Because her words haunted me every night.
For 1.5 years.
Every time I tried to start again, her voice came back:
“Failure.”
Last month… somehow… I gathered courage.
I stepped back into CTFs.
And Alhamdulillah…
I got 1st.
Finally.
The thing I chased for years.
The thing she wanted.
The thing I sacrificed everything for.
I won.
Everyone celebrated.
But inside…
It felt empty.
Because the person I wanted to share it with… wasn’t there.
No message.
No smile.
No “I’m proud of you.”
Just silence.
And that hurt more than losing ever did.
Funny na?
When I didn’t have first place, I had her.
Now I have first place… but lost her… lost myself… lost everything.
Sometimes it feels like my life’s maqsad is already finished.
Like the story ended… but I’m still alive.
Life is hard, man.
Sometimes you don’t lose because you’re weak.
You lose because you loved too much.

1qxtazb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1qxtazb/i_tried_dopamine_detox_for_30_days_and_it/,I tried dopamine detox for 30 days and it completely changed my life,"Everyone talks about ""dopamine detoxes"" like they’re some magic pill. I used to think it was just another productivity trend for people who have too much free time.

But then I realized I couldn't even sit through a 10-minute YT video without checking my phone three times. My brain was fried. I was constantly ""busy"" but getting absolutely nothing done. I decided to go all in for 30 days. No mindless scrolling, no binge-watching, no junk food, and no background music.

Here is what actually happened.

The First Week: I hated everything
The first 7 days were pure mental withdrawal. I’d reach for my phone every five minutes like a reflex. I felt restless, bored, and honestly, pretty irritable. I realized I hadn't been ""alone with my thoughts"" in years. I was just constantly numbing myself with content.

The Turning Point: The ""Fog"" lifted
By week three, something weird happened. Small things started feeling fun again. A cup of coffee, a walk without a podcast, a conversation with a friend—these things actually gave me a hit of genuine hit of enjoyment instead of just being background noise.

My focus came back. I could actually sit down and work for 4 hours straight without feeling that ""itch"" to check Instagram.

How I actually stayed consistent
I’ll be honest—I almost quit on Day 10. I got distracted, felt like I was missing out on the world, and almost went back to my old habits of doomscrolling until 2 AM.

I realized that ""willpower"" isn't enough when your brain is literally wired for distraction. I started using planners just to keep my daily goals in front of me and stay accountable. It’s hard to slip back into old habits when you have a system that forces you to look at what you actually wanted to accomplish that day.

I also started using notes to dump all the random creative ideas that started flowing once my brain wasn't clogged with TikToks. You don't have to use these specific apps, but if you don't have a system to track your progress, you will fail when the boredom hits.

The Verdict: Was it worth it?
100%. I didn't become a monk, but I did reset my baseline.

My anxiety dropped because I wasn't constantly comparing my life to 15-second clips of others.
My productivity doubled because I stopped leaking energy into distractions.
I actually enjoy my life more because I'm present for it.

The goal isn't to delete the internet forever. It's to stop being a slave to the ""instant hit"" so you can actually build something that matters.

Give it 30 days. You’ll be bored out of your mind at first, but on the other side of that boredom is the version of you that actually gets things done.",16,1770410551.0,Discipline,2,0.9,False

Our relationship was perfect when it started- I fully believed he was my soulmate. Everything about him I fell so deeply in love with. He was so kind, sweet, he had the prettiest smile I had ever seen. I loved his laugh, how he'd sing all the songs I LOVED. He'd make me feel like the most special girl in the world.

  
If you had asked a week ago- I'd skip this part and immediately jump into in self guilt. 

  
It started getting rocky when I came back from a vacation; he'd get jealous of me being with friends. He'd accuse me of hooking up with friends, he stopped sending me cute things on instagram and TikTok. I suffer from manageable (at the time, hop back to that) depression and anxiety, and he has BPD. So, there would be times I'd have panic attacks or depressive episodes and be unable to do anything but be sad. He would leave me there, and it really hurt.. He would watch me cry or have full blown panic attacks and give me like a sentence of advice, then leave. This was common for him to just leave.

  
I was there for him during his episodes. I'd deescalate the situation, hold him while he cried, reassure him. There was never any reassurance on my end, unless it was forced or he seemed annoyed with his response. He also just sort of became distant, not as happy around me. Didn't look at me with love, stopped smiling. It destroyed me. There was one day I woke up to him trying to go through my phone, but the passcode wasn't changed (I was discussing with my sister the day before about potentially leaving him). My phone was locked for an hour due to incorrect password attempts.

The months after May- my friend had passed away, an ex boyfriend had passed away, my veryyyy loved cat passed away, I discovered my friend who disappeared prior had passed away. I've never dealt with grief before- nobody has ever passed away close to me. So all this grief stressed me out to the point I had my first multiple sclerosis attack.

On top of all the deaths, I got diagnosed with MS. I had watched my mom suffer from MS my entire life. It felt like all my dreams got crushed that day in the hospital. I lost my dreams of wanting children, wanting a future, wanting anything out of life but to live in the moment. But all my future plans flew out the window. I became depressed, the kind of depressed you fake a smile every day just so people around you don't hate you.

  
He also lost his job around that time, so I was financially supporting most of our activities. He never tried to get a job after losing his.

  
The first month of being diagnosed, October now, I was fine. The major depression didn't hit. I had music festivals and a bunch of October plans. I dragged my partner along, and when I say he was miserable during all these events- I mean it. 4 days in Vegas, and he was just angry and miserable the whole time. A concert, miserable; any hobby or activity was miserable. I stayed hoping I'd get that wonderful boy back.

  
But I know I wasn't a saint. I'd spent 5/7 of my days depressed, anxious, wanting to die. And the other two days were just numb enough to where I could attempt to be the girl I was before. But even when I tried to be her, he was so miserable and brought down my positive attitude. But there would also be days he'd be that same guy I fell in love with. He'd bring me lunch to work, or a coffee. Now that I'm typing that out- it was few and far between. I never saw a lot of the old him.

I put a lot of my mental health struggles on him. I regret that. December and January I'd say how I didn't want to be here, how I just wanted to die. Threaten? No, but express how my life just doesn't seem livable anymore. I feel guilt for that, but also in January I sucked it up and started seeing a therapist again which made things way more manageable. 

  
Our break up was caused a few weeks ago. We had gone on an okay date that day- but I really missed seeing him happy. I missed affection and intimacy, I missed being treated on dates, and I missed when he planned dates. So I communicated how I wasn't happy, how I missed all those things. And he basically told me he didn't trust me because he got a text on his phone a few weeks prior; it was an unknown number explaining how she wanted to go down on him. He claimed it was me, and also accused me of trying to hack into his twitter; which I didn't even know he had. I got mad, I was fed up at this point. Basically I flipped out on him, which is something I'd never done before. And I regret that. He didn't deserve that. 

  
He broke up with me over text. Saying he wasn't happy, he didn't love himself and goodbye. I didn't argue, I just said ""goodbye"".

  
I've been mourning him- not the one I dated as of recent, I think I fell out of love with him. But I am so deeply in love with the idea of who he was when we met. I loved that man so much. He was the most perfect angel in the world. I wish none of this would have happened. He was the most amazing person. He was amazing to and for me, and I know I'll never find, nor want to find a connection like that again. That guy, the one he was, was my soulmate.

  
Basically, I broke no contact. I emailed him. I apologized for what I did, took accountability. I told him how this relationship looked from my perspective; how he seemed miserable and out of love with me. How it was hard and I can't sleep at night without knowing what I did during the summer to make him fall out of love with me.

  
He sent a really cruel message back. He basically told me he fell out of love with me and started resenting me when I was feeling suicidal. He didn't take accountability for the things he put me through. He placed all the blame on me.. And it hurt. I guess that's what I deserved for breaking contact, but holy shit it hurt to read that. I feel guilt, but also being without him the past two weeks I've had so much motivation. Rereading texts with my sister dating from August about how I wanted to leave, how I didn't know how, how I wish he'd be that beautiful guy again. She asked me in September if I saw myself marrying him, I said ""no but I would marry him if he was the same guy he was the first 6 months of our relationship"". and somehow those texts gave way more closure than anything he texted me.

  
I'm doing better now, and it's been two weeks since we broke up. I've reapplied to school, I am currently planning my European backpacking trip, I developed a steady friend group. I'm moving out of my parents house after my trip in May. I feel better without him, but damn if I'm not mourning that sweet boy I fell in love with the most.",7,1770410508.0,ExNoContact,2,1.0,False

Det var en virkelig velbesøgt begivenhed, især lørdag, hvor der var lange køer, til de mange stande, og de fleste steder var helt klart ventetiden værd.
Samtlige ejere og baristaer knoklede for at brygge de mange liter kaffe, og samtidig repræsenterede de deres respektive risterier helt fantastisk venligt og professionelt.
Kaffe fra Aquiares, Costa Rica, var virkelig kraftigt repræsenteret, og min oplevelse var, at størstedelen af de deltagende risterier, gjorde det rigtigt godt med denne kaffe. 
Jeg selv foretrak to af disse fra Bentax, som jeg indtil sidste weekend, ikke havde stødt på før.

Kolo Coffee fra Berlin havde ifølge min smag, festivalens absolut mest interessante og lækre kaffe, deres Uganda Imbalu, som desværre allerede var udsolgt, da jeg vendte tilbage i anden runde, for at købe en pose 😮‍💨
Coffee Collective brillerede også med deres Jhoan, men jeg har virkelig svært ved at få min ægtefælle til at tolerere kaffepriser på over 2.000kr./kg.

Quickborn fra Slovakiet, bød på flere gode meget fugtige kaffer, og indtog en god tredjeplads i min smagsoplevelse, med deres Kenya.

Round Hill Roastery fra England serverede også lækker frugtig kaffe, og ejeren fortalte, at han er i gang med at åbne et risteri i Danmark.

Rayana Roast var drevet af ægteparret Ray og Yana, de var super flinke, og elskede at fortælle historien om deres ægteskab og deres kaffe, samt deres unikke posedesign. De gav en lækker rabatkupon til køb på deres hjemmeside. Bare en lille heads-up herfra; det er virkelig kraftigt smagende og funky kaffe de laver, så jeg er sikker på, at det ikke er for alle.

Jeg har her vedlagt billeder af de rabatkuponer, som jeg modtog til festivalen, og jeg håber på, at dette kan være med til at booste de små risteriers levebrød 🤞🏻

I often still cry because I miss her so much. I find it interesting that most of my treasured memories that pop into my head are after she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2015. Sure, I remember other fun times with me, my twin sister, and mom, like when mom would constantly hug me or say ""I love you"" and I would get annoyed as a teenager (oh, how I miss that today!) or when the three of us would laugh over silliness that no one else got. The memories that bring me to tears, though, happened in the last 7 years of her life, while we were fighting Alzheimer's. This is when we felt most connected, and I wouldn't change it for the world.

Growing up, my twin sister, Lisa, and I lived with our single mother, who always said, ""I won't get married until you girls are out on your own."" We did not like that! It felt like she was always in our business, and we just wanted her to ""get a life"". I credit my mom's tenacity and never-ending love, as both our mother and father, for my confidence and ability to love unconditionally. She was my rock, my mentor, my safety net. Our father left us, never to be seen again, at the age of 11. Mom never asked him for help or money, and I wonder if that was the agreement between them so he'd stay away. He was a piece of work!

Mom was my best friend for most of my adult life. I moved to San Francisco in 2008, 3 hours from Watsonville, where my sister and mother built their lives. In my mid 20's, I started calling mom on weekends and doing our weekly ""walk'n talk"" calls. I'd grab coffee, call her, and she would listen to all my dating or friend hardships and give some sage advice that mostly just made me feel loved and heard. Again, being my safety net. My heart broke when she started having difficulty following the stories. That was about 2017 or so. This is when it all changed forever.

Before 2015, the three of us were close-ish. My sister and I have always been close, but my sister and mom were not. They clashed a lot when we were growing up. Mom taught us, family comes first, and we did that for each other, but mom and Lisa really didn't interact other than holidays or when mom watched Lisa's son after school. There was no lack of love there; there just wasn't really a friendship.

After 2015, Lisa naturally took the primary caregiver role since she lived 5 minutes from mom. For this, I am eternally grateful. She handled it with compassion, dignity, and pride. She was there for mom when she needed it most. I see this as a gift to each other. I took the secondary caregiver role, mostly helping virtually and medicare, and cared for mom on Thursdays so Lisa had a full day off. Those Thursdays were some of the hardest days I've ever experienced and most treasured. The picture is from mom's favorite diner. We would have fun! Each week, I would blow the straw's paper wrapper at mom, and she'd be surprised each time, the good and bad of Alzheimer's. We'd laugh a lot!

We were a team, the three of us, until the day mom died. My sister and I cried and laughed through it, and it seemed like mom loved the attention she got from her adult daughters. We bonded, fought, planned, strategized, supported, and connected deeply, all because of Alzheimer's.

I'll end with, caregivers are angels on earth. Your commitment to family is literally saving lives and making them so much better. I am eternally grateful for your work and want you to know you are appreciated.",5,1770410072.0,AgingParents,2,0.86,False

I like the chill, laid-back vibe of coffee shops and tap houses, but I’m looking for places where there’s more of a social scene, ideally where people in their late 20s/early 30s hang out and are open to conversation.

I’m particularly interested in fitness, biohacking, business, and marketing, so anywhere people discuss those kinds of topics would be ideal, but I’m also just down for good tap houses or social spots where it’s easy to strike up conversations.

1qxt1dw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qxt1dw,Opinions/Ideas for Decorating Bedroom,"Hello,

I recently moved and my brain is a bit fried from moving + work + life, so I'd love some opinions and suggestions on ideas that I had for decorating!

I wanted to paint my room and I was deciding between this [green color](https://www.behr.com/consumer/ColorDetailView/S420-5) and this [burgundy color](https://www.sherwin-williams.com/en-us/color/color-family/red-paint-colors/sw6027-cordovan). I've used the green color before for a living room at my old place and loved it so I'm going to use it for an accent wall in my living room currently. I thought maybe an adjacent color that's a bit darker like [this](https://www.behr.com/consumer/ColorDetailView/S420-6) or even [this](https://www.behr.com/consumer/ColorDetailView/S420-7) would be nice so the bedroom space feels close to the living room in color, but still different.

I love burgundy as a color but I've never used it for paint. My only concern would be, due to the size and awkward angles of the bedroom, the burgundy would make the room feel very claustrophobic with all the furniture in there and little light. I also think it wouldn't really match well with my [bedframe](https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/latitude-run-brody-queen-bed-walnut-cdch2189.html), although I was debating getting rid of it anyways so I'm not married to it. If i did, I'd probably go with a more modern looking bedframe like [this](https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/willa-arlo-interiors-candler-velvet-upholstered-platform-bed-with-wingback-headboard-and-wooden-slats-w100424919.html?piid=2103532804%2C2103532806). My current working idea for the place is pairing some modern furniture pieces like [this](https://www.westelm.com/products/harris-loft-sofa-76-h4991/?pkey=sWE&sb=WE) with some dark wood accent pieces like end tables, coffee tables, nightstands, etc.

As far as the rest of the room, I was thinking of adding some tall, sheer curtains, and some wood nightstands (like walnut or mahogany) to go with the room. Once I have an idea on the paint, I'll probably get a nice rug to complement it.

I would love to hear anyone else's thoughts on what I've come up with so far! Should I paint the room green? Or go with burgundy? Should I ditch the bedframe?",1,1770409951.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

I've had constant Bloating, daily diarrhoea, and horrifyingly, last month developed a painful internal hemorrhoid. 

I did not think this was related. I tried to treat it with over the counter options but it was not getting better so I booked with a specialist, believing I would need surgery to remove it based on what I read.


It was so humiliating and painful. The strange thing was, it would always flare up in the afternoon /evening. 


Day 1 of stopping drinking, it literally cured itself. Immediately. I don't know exactly how this is related, I was never constipated or had any other habits that cause hemorrhoids. I believe it's something to do with alcohol irritating my intestines. 


Also immediately:

- no more Bloating. My stomach is so flat and I feel so lean 


- the swelling on my upper right stomach went down over couple days 



- the discomfort / pain in my upper right stomach disappeared after 3 days 



- I can eat more! I love food but had been feeling like I would get full really quickly and had not been able to eat much 
I believe this was alcohol induced gastritis. 




- no more acid reflux 



- resting heart rate went from 80 to 68



- no more multiple painful diarrhoea every day 



- sleep quality is not so good first few days after stopping drinking. I always used to sleep very well and for longer hours. Now I'm waking very early and also sometimes struggling to fall asleep but it seems to be improving 





- saving $150-200/week. Drinking buckets of decaf coffee and tea.



I'm a functioning alcoholic. Only thing that motivates me is not being in pain, and also fear about permanent damage

Hiya! I have a 12'-by-11' (3.6m x 3.4m) corner space with some tall, narrow windows. I think I've made the space functional by putting a TV and media console centered between windows on one wall, an area rug, coffee table, and large-ish L-shaped sofa (seats 3-4). It works, kind of, but it's not very cozy. There's some tripping over the table and squeezing to get to the middle of the couch. There's also no nearby storage for random things, so they tend to accumulate on the table, couch, floor.

The couch and TV get a lot of use, and folks like to eat their lunches & snacks at the coffee table, sitting on the couch.

Recently the couch has been falling apart and I am hoping the entire space can be improved drastically if redone from scratch. I'll be getting new furniture anyway, so now is the time for drastic changes.

I had always been a bit of a wild card ever since I was a teenager. I had a good childhood and great parents. I started smoking weed in 7th grade by high school was getting wasted with the boys on the reg definitely more than my peers. By my early 20s it was drinking every night then popping e and doing coke every night too. After some traumatic stuff in my personal life in my mid 20s, instead of dealing with my emotions I hit the gas pedal, and before you knew it I was taking 4-6 mg of xans a day on top of drinking, coke benders and any and every drug I could get my hands on 24/7. Drugs were my life and I was synonymous with drugs. It’s what I did and what people knew me for, that fucked up guy. My real friends were all long gone, now it was just randoms I’d meet out while getting fucked up, like some big addiction echo chamber. It went like this for years until one day in February 2016. I woke up in my driveway in the driver seat of my truck, no idea where I was or how I got there. Last thing I remember I was out for a quick drink the night before. Blackout were happening more frequently and for longer periods of time. Genuine blackout where no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t remember what had happened. I lived with lots of guilt and shame, and was ready for it to be over. I had a plan for how I was going to cash out. For whatever reason that day I felt desperate, I googled for an AA meeting in my area and there was one down the street. I walked over to it sat down drank some shitty coffee and thought, “this is some fuckin bullshit”. An older guy saw me there and bought me a copy of the big book, I walked home and read it under the tree out front of my house. I came back the next day. 

The next few months were hell for me, withdrawals from the benzos genuinely made me want to give up. It was honestly close to two years before that was done. I was fragile and broken, but I was determined. I spent a lot of time alone that first while, then I went off to a remote job far away from everything I knew for years. Eventually I met my wife, we have two beautiful children now and some days I can’t believe this is my life. I can’t say I think I deserved this, but I am grateful every day for them and I shower them with 100% of my time and presence. 

It’s been a weird trip the last 10 years, I don’t really have anyone in my life that wants to hear about this story so if anyone wants to know anything about the journey please free to ask. And anyone out there struggling, just know that it is possible change and that your past does not have to define your future. With gratitude and respect, AMA. ",62,1770409454.0,AMA,28,0.98,False

1qxsrq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsIN/comments/1qxsrq7/after_6_months_of_rejections_i_finally_got/,"After 6 months of rejections, I finally got interviews at DeepMind, FAIR, and OpenAI.","Been getting auto-rejected from every AI role for half a year. Mid-tier PhD, mediocre research, never worked at FAANG.

Last month I landed interviews at:

Google DeepMind

Meta FAIR

OpenAI

No offers yet (still interviewing), but figured I'd share what changed since I was probably doing everything wrong before.

**The keyword thing is real**

Turns out these places literally filter resumes by keywords before anyone reads them.

You need these exact words:

LLM or Large Language Models

RLHF

Post-training or Fine-tuning

Transformer, RAG, etc.

Not ""I worked on ML stuff"" or ""familiar with AI."" The actual terms.

I changed this:

""Improved recommendation system using machine learning""

To this:

""Optimized LLM recommendation system using RLHF, improved scores 23%""

Went from zero responses to three interviews in a month.

**Name-dropping is sketchy but it works**

If you're at a big company and talked to someone from an AI team even once, put it on your resume. Like you're at Google Ads and sat in one meeting where a DeepMind person presented. You can write:

SWE, Google Ads (worked with DeepMind Research)

The difference between ""Google Ads"" and ""touched DeepMind once"" is huge for these applications.

If you don't have this yet, go make it happen:

Message people in AI orgs for coffee chats

Find cross-team projects to help with

Submit literally one bug fix to their code

Just need something real you can point to.

**They want a 2000-word writeup (nobody mentions this)**

DeepMind, FAIR, OpenAI, Anthropic all asked me for this. Not code, not a demo—a long written explanation of your best project.

First time I sent in 3 paragraphs like:

""Built backend system with microservices, worked with team, shipped on time""

Rejected everywhere.

What worked was 1800 words structured like:

\* Problem (150w) - what sucked and why

\* How you solved it (900w) - architecture, why you picked it, alternatives you considered, actual implementation stuff

\* Results (400w) - numbers, impact, metrics

\* Problems you hit (250w) - bugs, issues, how you fixed them

\* What's next (100w) - how you'd improve it

Took me a week to write. Annoying but it's what got me the interviews.Write it like a paper. Be technical. Show you actually think about tradeoffs.

**Apply to the specific AI teams, not general SWE**

\* ""Google DeepMind Research Engineer""

\* ""Meta FAIR Research Scientist""

\* ""OpenAI Applied AI Engineer""

cause:

Their recruiters actually know what RLHF means

Way fewer people apply (most don't think they're qualified)

They care about depth not LeetCode grinding

**System design prep is different for AI roles**

LeetCode is still needed but system design matters way more. And it's not just memorizing patterns—they drill into every decision.

Been practicing with Screna AI and it's actually helpful because it keeps asking followups:

Me: ""Use Redis for caching""  

It: ""Why not Memcached?""  

Me: ""Need data structures not just key-value""  

It: ""What if Redis crashes?""  

Me: ""RDB snapshots every 5min""  

It: ""Recovery process? How much data loss?""

Real interviews are apparently like this they keep pushing on every choice you make. Most prep stuff just gives you the answer, doesn't simulate the back and forth.

We'll see if it actually helps. Interviews are next week.

Current status

\* DeepMind: system design round Tuesday

\* FAIR: scheduling tech rounds

\* OpenAI: Thursday

I’m not looking to vent — just trying to understand what might have happened so I can move past it. Thanks in advance for any insight.",1,1770409079.0,datingadvice,7,0.99,False

We produce very small batches of cold brew (and sometimes hot brew), which we filter and can. We’ve been asked hundreds of times—since there’s no other RTD coffee in our country—if we could sell it outside of our brewery.

I was wondering: could an autoclave do the job of a retort, since it uses pressure and high temperatures? Another idea was to tunnel-pasteurize the cans and then send samples to a lab to check for bacteria, yeast, mold, etc. The idea would be to keep the product strictly refrigerated.

Otherwise, the only real options would be a retort, UHT with aseptic filling, right? Is there even any preservatives that could do the work ?   
  
Does anyone know of a small retort we could use to get started—maybe something that can handle a couple hundred cans per day?",3,1770409049.0,TheBrewery,11,0.8,False

I don’t tip at fast food places, only sit down spots. But as my mom has become a more frequent Starbucks coffee drinker I started to wonder if it is more of a thing to tip there?

1qxslsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qxslsx/i_broke_no_contact/,I broke no contact,"I (24F) and my partner (24M) broke up a few weeks ago. 

  
Our relationship was perfect when it started- I fully believed he was my soulmate. Everything about him I fell so deeply in love with. He was so kind, sweet, he had the prettiest smile I had ever seen. I loved his laugh, how he'd sing all the songs I LOVED. He'd make me feel like the most special girl in the world.

  
If you had asked a week ago- I'd skip this part and immediately jump into in self guilt. 

  
It started getting rocky when I came back from a vacation; he'd get jealous of me being with friends. He'd accuse me of hooking up with friends, he stopped sending me cute things on instagram and TikTok. I suffer from manageable (at the time, hop back to that) depression and anxiety, and he has BPD. So, there would be times I'd have panic attacks or depressive episodes and be unable to do anything but be sad. He would leave me there, and it really hurt.. He would watch me cry or have full blown panic attacks and give me like a sentence of advice, then leave. This was common for him to just leave. There was one day I woke up to him trying to go through my phone, but the passcode wasn't changed (I was discussing with my sister the day before about potentially leaving him). My phone was locked for an hour due to incorrect password attempts.

  
I was there for him during his episodes. I'd deescalate the situation, hold him while he cried, reassure him. There was never any reassurance on my end, unless it was forced or he seemed annoyed with his response. He also just sort of became distant, not as happy around me. Didn't look at me with love, stopped smiling. It destroyed me. 

The months after May- my friend had passed away, an ex boyfriend had passed away, my veryyyy loved cat passed away, I discovered my friend who disappeared prior had passed away. I've never dealt with grief before- nobody has ever passed away close to me. So all this grief stressed me out to the point I had my first multiple sclerosis attack.

On top of all the deaths, I got diagnosed with MS. I had watched my mom suffer from MS my entire life. It felt like all my dreams got crushed that day in the hospital. I lost my dreams of wanting children, wanting a future, wanting anything out of life but to live in the moment. But all my future plans flew out the window. I became depressed, the kind of depressed you fake a smile every day just so people around you don't hate you.

  
He also lost his job around that time, so I was financially supporting most of our activities. He never tried to get a job after losing his.

  
The first month of being diagnosed, October now, I was fine. The major depression didn't hit. I had music festivals and a bunch of October plans. I dragged my partner along, and when I say he was miserable during all these events- I mean it. 4 days in Vegas, and he was just angry and miserable the whole time. A concert, miserable; any hobby or activity was miserable. I stayed hoping I'd get that wonderful boy back.

  
But I know I wasn't a saint. I'd spent 5/7 of my days depressed, anxious, wanting to die. And the other two days were just numb enough to where I could attempt to be the girl I was before. But even when I tried to be her, he was so miserable and brought down my positive attitude. But there would also be days he'd be that same guy I fell in love with. He'd bring me lunch to work, or a coffee. Now that I'm typing that out- it was few and far between. I never saw a lot of the old him.

I put a lot of my mental health struggles on him. I regret that. December and January I'd say how I didn't want to be here, how I just wanted to die. Threaten? No, but express how my life just doesn't seem livable anymore. I feel guilt for that, but also in January I sucked it up and started seeing a therapist again which made things way more manageable. 

  
Our break up was caused a few weeks ago. We had gone on an okay date that day- but I really missed seeing him happy. I missed affection and intimacy, I missed being treated on dates, and I missed when he planned dates. So I communicated how I wasn't happy, how I missed all those things. And he basically told me he didn't trust me because he got a text on his phone a few weeks prior; it was an unknown number explaining how she wanted to go down on him. He claimed it was me, and also accused me of trying to hack into his twitter; which I didn't even know he had. I got mad, I was fed up at this point. Basically I flipped out on him, which is something I'd never done before. And I regret that. He didn't deserve that. 

  
He broke up with me over text. Saying he wasn't happy, he didn't love himself and goodbye. I didn't argue, I just said ""goodbye"".

  
I've been mourning him- not the one I dated as of recent, I think I fell out of love with him. But I am so deeply in love with the idea of who he was when we met. I loved that man so much. He was the most perfect angel in the world. I wish none of this would have happened. He was the most amazing person. He was amazing to and for me, and I know I'll never find, nor want to find a connection like that again. That guy, the one he was, was my soulmate.

  
Basically, I broke no contact. I emailed him. I apologized for what I did, took accountability. I told him how this relationship looked from my perspective; how he seemed miserable and out of love with me. How it was hard and I can't sleep at night without knowing what I did during the summer to make him fall out of love with me.

  
He sent a really cruel message back. He basically told me he fell out of love with me and started resenting me when I was feeling suicidal. He didn't take accountability for the things he put me through. He placed all the blame on me.. And it hurt. I guess that's what I deserved for breaking contact, but holy shit it hurt to read that. I feel guilt, but also being without him the past two weeks I've had so much motivation. Rereading texts with my sister dating from August about how I wanted to leave, how I didn't know how, how I wish he'd be that beautiful guy again. She asked me in September if I saw myself marrying him, I said ""no but I would marry him if he was the same guy he was the first 6 months of our relationship"". and somehow those texts gave way more closure than anything he texted me.

  
I'm doing better now, and it's been two weeks since we broke up. I've reapplied to school, I am currently planning my European backpacking trip, I developed a steady friend group. I'm moving out of my parents house after my trip in May. I got diagnosed with ADHD, and potentially for either BPD or Bipolar 2. Which, in retrospect I do better on my own and single, so BPD would make sense. I feel better without him, but damn if I'm not mourning that sweet boy I fell in love with the most.
