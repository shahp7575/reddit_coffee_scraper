1ga1ouk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ga1ouk/aitah_for_still_thinking_of_a_past_situationship/,AITAH for still thinking of a past situationship while meeting a man who has the qualities I want to have in a husband?,"This story includes me (19 years old), Adam (23 years old) and Ian (23 years old). 

It all started in my first year of college. I (at the time 18 years old) didn't really know anyone on campus so I would often be studying alone. I would explore different buildings on the campus and eventually made my way to one where I got comfortable. I found a spot and eventually started doing my own thing. Eventually, I saw a guy come in and sit within the area I was studying who I thought was cute. At the time, I had this challenge for myself where I would try to compliment at least 3 people a day to get out of my comfort zone. I noticed the guy had shoes that I've been wanting but I didn't know the model. I took this as an opportunity to compliment his shoes and ask where he got them from. We made a bit of small talk and returned back to our studies. Some time went by and I saw in my peripheral view the guy was packing his things to get up. I didn't think much of it until he started walking up to me to continue where we left off from our previous small talk. We then exchanged our names - for this story, we'll call him Adam (at the time 22 years old) - and I found out that he lived in the same area as me. Over time, we began making plans to meet up at cafes in our area and would hang out a lot.

One thing that began bothering me though was when he would arrive pretty late when we made plans to meet, going from 30 minutes late to an hour at times. I did bring this up to him and he would have these excuses like his parents holding him up to talk to him at home before leaving and he would say that was what happened every time. We eventually talked it over and Adam said he'll do his best to be on time again. The lateness would repeat again. One point, I got really fed up and decided to not initiate any conversations or engage with him. That went on for a month. Then, the second semester began and he reached out to me again to hang out to study. At this point, I didn't really think of him as much until he reached out so I decided to hang out again. We went back to meeting at cafes and such, but I noticed there has been more of a shift in our hangouts. 

We would stay out pretty late - several times we would be at campus until 12 am or 1 am. I also noticed the way he would say things and pay for me at times for a coffee or a dessert. I started picking up as if these were him showing interest in me. We were spending a lot of time with each other. Towards the end of the semester, I reached out to him one time if he wanted to study at a cafe again and he mentioned that we didn't have to study every time that we hung out. Following that message, we went out to eat some sushi, get mochi doughnuts, and stayed out simply talking. 

I started to grow more of an attraction towards him. One night, he called me and asked if I wanted to see the northern lights. It was pretty rare for my area to get the northern lights and I agreed to see it with him. He picked me up from my house (I had to sneak out) and we went to a park nearby. It was such a peaceful night and although the lights weren't really visible, we simply just talked about life. I still remember the stillness of the pond and the coolness of the air. It was also midnight and it was his birthday so we sort of spent the first few hours of his birthday doing that. When he drove me back home, I decided to confess to him. I felt the feeling was mutual so I shared everything I felt about him, though we had to cut the conversation short because I had to sneak back into my house before my parents woke up for work. 

We eventually met up again at a parking lot because I reached out to him to run some errands with me. We made it to his car and this was where everything shifted in our friendship. He shared how he had an attraction towards me as well and we could start dating but it would eventually have to end. I did not mention this before but this is a brown guy coming from a Pakistani family. I am not Pakistani. He stated that his parents would want him to end up with a Pakistani wife so it would never work out between him and I. But he said he would also still be fine if we just stayed as friends. When I heard that, my heart went into pieces. I was just so confused and said that I would get back to him about it once I've had some time to think about it. I remember crying the moment I hit my bed. After much thought, I decided that it would be best to stop talking to him. I just couldn't wrap my mind around the fact of why he would make certain moves as if he was attracted to me, say that he liked me, but then end up saying it would never work out. By this time, this was basically an 8-month situationship. 

We met up again to talk at the same park where we saw the northern lights because I'd rather tell him in person about everything I felt about the whole situation. I still liked him but I wanted to stop talking to him. We ended up sitting at a bench near a lake as we talked. Then I ended up having my first kiss with him. Everything became so complicated after that. We started doing some things that we shouldn't have done, especially as Muslims (I reverted about a year ago). I let him touch me in ways I shouldn't have let him do and I felt so guilty throughout it all. I knew it had to end but it was all so intoxicating I stopped thinking straight. I was intoxicated with lust. One night, we met up again and we were out really late. This was going to be the last night I ever saw him again. We met up at the park. Then I saw a bombardment of notifications on my phone. It was my mom. She was texting, calling, Facetiming me from iMessage to Messenger. I had my phone on DND so I didn't see it for a while. My mom and dad were threatening to call the police if I didn't get home and it was just a horrible, horrible night. They told me to stay at the park until my dad got there to see me even though I told them I was already on my way home. As I was waiting for my dad, Adam just drove off. I got home and I was yelled at, which I expected. I shouldn't have been out that late. Then I saw a text from Adam checking up on me.

Being overwhelmed with emotions, I told him that we need to finally stop talking. He had a cold response just saying things like ""I guess it was just a waste of time then"" and so forth. Few weeks after that, we were sort of back and forth, I would be blocking and then unblocking him. But then I just got so tired. So exhausted. And I knew it was time to finally let him go. He never saw anything serious with me and I knew what I was getting myself into when I continued keeping contact with him after he told me it would never work out. I acknowledge that I brought all that hurt to myself. I didn't want to disrespect myself like that again. I wanted to move on so I decided to download Salams (Muslim dating app). Met some...interesting people there and honestly I didn't think I would really find anything serious there. I suppose I was just trying to find someone because I felt lonely.

As I said before, I am a revert and I would have worries that no one would want to marry me because of my background. I told my parents that I reverted to Islam (shortly after they found out about me being out late with Adam) and they were anything but accepting. My mom pulled my hair, my dad was about to throw something at me, and said it would be a disgrace to the family if I actually was serious about being Muslim. They also mentioned how my grandparents would be twisting in their graves because of my decision. They brought up about having me talking to a priest and taking me to therapy (none of that happened though lol). My mom talked about how she felt she failed as a mother and should've kept me in Catholic school into my high school years; for context, I went to a Catholic private school until 7th grade and then switched to a charter school. They think I'm just gullible and naive and just follow whatever my friends would say since basically all of them are Muslim, as well as the fact that the college I go to has a significant Muslim population. Going back to downloading Salams, I would talk to a few guys here and there until I met one that really wanted me to set my act straight. This would be Ian.

When we initially talked, I wanted to set the fact that I wanted to talk if marriage was in mind. He had the same intention as well. We then asked questions to each other such as how many kids we would want, where would we want to live, how we pray, our goals, and going about how I'm a revert and there would be a lot of issues that would come with that, especially with family - pretty much the important questions to ask before marriage. He was all for it. He said that he would be willing to work things through with me. I met Ian on the app two months after my situation with Adam. Ian has been so loving, caring, patient, kind, everything I wanted in a man. He has been so understanding with me considering my situation with my parents and I have felt myself falling in love with him more and more after he confessed his love for me. We would call, text, facetime, keep each other updated with everything going on in our lives. He goes to the gym, prays, can make food, is a family man, wants to grow in his deen...He has the qualities I would want in a man that I would marry. We both deleted Salams shortly after meeting there. He said wallahi to that when I asked him about it haha. 

He has talked to his cousins (he is very close with them), his brother, and friends about me but he has yet to tell his parents. He mentioned that he would tell them a year from now or so because they want him to first complete his studies (he's currently in a Master's degree program). I did ask how they would react about him being with a revert and was straight up about how yes, they would prefer him to be with someone of the same culture as well (he's desi; I prefer not to be specific), but as long as they are a woman who is educated and follows their deen as a Muslim, they would be accepting. We've been talking for about 3 months and he is so easy to talk to, I can truly see having a life with him. Yet, I feel undeserving of his love. I don't feel worthy of how kind and understanding he has treated me. Like I mentioned before, I met him two months after I stopped talking to Adam. And I felt so guilty for the fact that I would still think about Adam here and there while talking to Ian, though I have no interest in engaging with Adam again. I still feel that way. And I feel so disgusted and disappointed with myself for still thinking about a guy who disrespected me. 

I never told Ian about Adam specifically but I mentioned how I had a situationship with a person and kissed before (I didn't share exactly how recent it was) and he also shared that he was in a situationship as well and got intimate. For me, I don't have the expectation for a man to not have been intimate before as I am not to that expectation myself. Back in high school, I used to be on an app called Yubo - basically you meet strangers online - during quarantine and after. I would meet random guys there (this was prior to me reverting) and I would do a lot of ""freaky calls"" - basically pleasuring myself while the person on the other side of the call did the same thing. I'd say this would be one of the lowest times of my life because I only ever saw value in myself from seeing another guy having sexual pleasure. I don't even know how many guys I did this with online but I did it a lot and I am disgusted and hate myself for it. I started doing this when I was 16 and honestly recently just stopped at 19 a few months before I stopped talking to Adam. I guess it was sort of daddy issues or something since my father never showed a loving side of himself growing up and because of that, I looked for attention and affection from male validation. 

I never told any of this to Ian but I mentioned some of it to Adam when we were still talking. I suppose I would fall into this cycle whenever I would feel empty inside or was really craving for male attention. I also want to share that I have had an issue with viewing explicit videos online and still struggle with it. I know it's wrong and I seem to have fallen into that cycle whenever I would feel to be at my lowest. I was first exposed to it when I was 9 years old. Even now I still feel so disgusted with myself as I still continue to struggle with it. 

In addition to being a revert, I don't have a proper mahram. And that is a vital part if I want to get married. And I knew continuing talking to Ian was not right as I'd often talk to him alone on the phone for hours. I want to add whenever either of us would try to get into a conversation that was not exactly halal, he would say that we could not continue in those sort of conversations until we're married. He said that he was really serious about me and he didn't want us getting into a haram conversation to make me think he was talking to me for another reason.  I really wanted to make things right with him. So I would bring up to him that we need to stop talking, at least until we graduate and are prepared for marriage (it would be about 2 years from now since I'm in an accelerated program for my major and he would graduate in two years as well). He would respect what I brought up and we would go a week or so not talking. But then I would always be the one initiating contact with him again and he would respond. Then we would start talking again. That would happen another 2-3 times. We simply couldn't stop talking to each other. I brought up this situation to my best friend (who is Muslim) and she said if I really wanted to do this halal, we had to stop talking. Especially with the fact that I'm not ready for marriage. 

I just sent him a message about everything I felt about us talking and for him to block me as I would be blocking him. He has my best friend's number as well as my brother's and told him if there is anything really serious to tell me about to reach out to either of them (by the way, I trust my best friend that she would not do anything sneaky as she has a man of her own - she is a sister to me). I have prayed istikhara about being with Ian and have been looking for signs. And the sign of solitude is the one thing I've been feeling ever since I started praying about the possibility of me and him being together. I know I have not been at my best and still not at my best. I really want to become better as a woman and become worthy of being a wife to him. But I also understand if he is not for me and he ends up marrying someone else, it was simply not meant to be. I know if we are destined for each other, Allah SWT will find a way to bring us back together somehow (I forgot to mention he lives across the country from where I live so I have never met him in person).

But for now, I found it best that we go our separate ways. Honestly, I just want to become a better Muslim. It's been a year since I reverted and I want to do what is best for Allah SWT. I have done horrible things in the past and I continue to repent for my sins and I know I will make mistakes in the future. I suppose I'm just learning how to forgive myself for the things I've done and get over the fact that I did what I did and the only thing to focus on is to move forward. To learn how to simply love myself - flaws and all - because despite the things I've done, I still am deserving and worthy of that love, even when I don't feel like that way. That's the dilemma I'm currently deal with at the moment. I hope anyone who hears this, and may somehow share a similar situation as I, knows that they're not alone in any of this and we are more alike than we are different. And though it may feel there is no turning back from the sins that have been done, know that Allah SWT is the Most Merciful. ",0,1729656383.0,AITAH,0,0.5,False

1ga1lvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1ga1lvi/i_was_part_of_a_junior_detective_gang_in_a_small/,"I was part of a junior detective gang in a small town with no monsters. So, we decided to make our own.","When I was ten, I formed a junior detective squad. 

Mom bought me the entire box set of What's New Scooby Doo, and I was inspired to start my very own detective gang. I held auditions outside the gymnasium at recess (serious enquiries only) after a number of kids tried to apply for the role of *Scooby Doo* despite me reiterating I was not interested in playing make believe. 

When I was laughed at in class, I made posters strictly asking for SERIOUS wannabe detectives, even going as far as using my Mom’s printer to make flyers, sticking them all over the school. 

Auditions were simple. I asked them to solve a simple riddle. 

Whoever impressed me got to sign their name down, and I’d get back to them. 

I spent three days sifting through kids who definitely had charm, but they lacked the intelligence of a junior detective. Most kids were only auditioning to make fun of me, anyway. 

Still, though, I didn't give up. 

My flyers had five requirements: 

*1). You had to be smart.*

*2). You were not allowed to be a scaredy cat.*

*3). You had to accept your inevitable death at the hands of our town’s evil villains.*

*4). You had to have a fully registered driving licence (I quickly changed this to a bike).*

*5). You cannot have a criminal record.*

(I later scribbled this one out, writing over it. **“You cannot have any tardies.”*

Narrowing the applicants down to three kids, all of whom failed to share my enthusiasm for solving cases. The kids I picked didn't even know how to make plans, and when I invited them to my house, they stole my Mom’s necklace. 

I didn't even need to solve the mystery of who stole Mom’s necklace. The girl was wearing it at school. I punched her in the face, and was immediately sent to the principal’s office. When I was being given the mother all lectures, the door quietly opened, a head peeking through. 

It was Ben Callows, a freckly kid with overgrown brown hair hanging in his eyes. Ben really needed a haircut. 

He was always wearing the exact same baseball cap, and I found myself wondering if it was permanently glued to his head, stuck on top of unruly brown curls practically matted to his forehead.

In class, Ben was also known as Bloody Ben. In the second grade, the boy had a nosebleed in the middle of a spelling test, bleeding all over his paper. 

It's not like he didn't try and detach himself from the name. 

Ben brought in Digimon cards, so kids would call him *Digimon Ben* instead. 

Then he “accidentally” spilled yoghurt down his shirt in hopes we would call him *Yoghurt Ben.* But no. The kids in our class were relentless in reminding him of his name. No matter what he did, he was still Bloody Ben, and when anything related to blood came up in class, fifteen pairs of eyes would swivel to him, like he had *invented* the concept of bleeding. 

I feared the nickname would follow him to junior high. 

Ben didn't wait to be let in. He didn't even knock, striding in with his arms folded. Over the years, *Bloody Ben*, had definitely soured his personality. 

He smiled rarely, and when he *did* smile, someone was falling over or hurting themselves. 

Which definitely strengthened the claims of him being a sociopath. 

The rumor mill was churning, with the latest claiming Bloody Ben killed his cat. That wasn't true. Ben’s cat was seventeen with cancer, and *that* was why he was sobbing all the way through reading time. 

According to Ellie Daly, however, Ben had killed and dissected his kitty, and buried her in his Mom’s flowers. 

Now, my principal did not like being interrupted, especially when she was in the middle of screaming at me.

Principal Marrow was *old* old (like, thirty, in my ten year old mind) stick thin like a pencil, and always wore the same stained sweater. 

She used to be pretty, but I was convinced she had kissed a frog and been cursed. After our old principal suffered a stroke, she stepped in as a temporary replacement, and since becoming principal, had banned my favorite  book series, colored shoe laces, and hamburger helper, even officiating a uniform.

(vomit green shorts and a tee, and plain white sneakers). 

Kids were convinced she was a witch, and I kind of believed it.

Principal Marrow’s whole existence was built on sucking the fun out of school.

I was *already* reprimanded for my mystery gang flyers. 

Her office smelled of peppermint and she was definitely sneaking sips of whisky in her coffee cup. I could see the bottle sticking out of the trash. 

She straightened up, folding her arms across her chest, squinty eyes narrowing at the boy. I had spent the whole time she was lecturing me trying not to cry, my fists bunched in my lap. 

I took the distraction as the perfect opportunity to swipe at my eyes, allowing myself to breathe. 

Ben Callows was her victim now. 

I was right. The woman's voice was like a thunderclap in my ears. 

“You better have a good reason for not knocking, young man.”

Ben wasn't fazed by her tone. “You took my Switch two weeks ago,” he said, “I want it back, or I’m telling my Mom.”

At first, I thought I'd misheard him. 

No, I was *pretty* sure he'd threatened our principal. 

I swore I heard all of the breath sucked from the room. 

“I'm sorry,” Principal Marrow cleared her throat. Her soft tone was dangerous. 

She wasn't being nice. The lady was about to explode.

I could see visible veins straining in her temples, her right eye twitching. 

It was straight out of a cartoon. 

“Did you *forget* something, Ben?”

Ben sighed, like *she* was inconveniencing him. 

He held out his hand. “*Please* can I have my Switch back? It counts as stolen property. Give it back, or I'm telling my Mom.”

The kid put so much emphasis on the word *please*, I couldn't resist a smile. 

I think our principal was too shocked to get angry. 

“Get out.” She said, firmly. “I don't have your gaming device.” 

“It's in your drawer.” Ben nodded to her desk, “Under your divorce papers and the restraining order ordered by Jake Willow, the seventeen year old boy you've been having math ‘tutoring sessions’ with.” He quoted the air, his gaze lazily rolling to me. “*Tutoring*”

Principal Marrow went deathly pale, her eyes darkening. 

“Benjamin Callows–” 

“The school already knows about the restraining order, but your uncle is the head of the Board of Education, so all you get is a slap on the wrist and a warning to leave the boy alone.""

Ben continued, and I found myself mesmerised by his words. He was a natural, his expression stoic, mouth  curved with satisfaction that wasn't quite a smile. “However.” He held up his phone, pulling it away at the exact moment the teacher attempted to grab it. “You were outside Jake Willow’s house at 6:12am, drunk, and trying to climb through his window, which, I *think* violates the restraining order, does it not?”

Ben pretended to think *real* hard, his gaze flicking to the ceiling. 

“I mean, I'm just a kid, right?” His mouth curled into the hint of a smirk

“What do *I* know, huh?”

Principal Marrow’s expression twisted, her lip wobbling. 

“Mr Callows, remove yourself from my office, or I am calling your father.”

Leaning comfortably against the door, Ben’s lip twitched.

“Why? Are you planning on telling my Dad about your relations with a teenage boy, or will I have to tell him instead?”

I was enthralled, and fully disgusted, making a move to inch away from the woman. 

“But it doesn't end there.” Ben continued. He straightened up, taking slow, intimidating steps towards the woman's desk. “You don't even *want* Jake, do you? Because, once upon a time, you were in love with his father. Jason Willow. You despised him for rejecting you, so you decided to defile his son.” Ben leaned over the principal’s desk, slipping his hand into the drawer, and pulling out his switch.

*Painfully* slowly. 

She stood there, speechless, her shoulders trembling. 

Ben smiled, and I found myself liking it. 

“Thank *you*!” He said, waving the console in her face. Ben mimed locking his mouth and throwing away the key. 

“My lips are sealed.”

Ben’s half lidded eyes found mine. “Are ya coming, Panda?”

I forgot my own nickname. 

Panda. 

I wore my Mom’s eyeliner because I thought it looked cool. 

It did not. 

Finding my breath, I snapped out of it. 

Jumping up, I followed him out of the office, and when the two of us were safely on the hallway, I burst into hysterical giggles. “How did you *know* all of that?!” I whisper- shrieked. 

Ben surprised me with a splutter. “Wait. You *believed* me?”

Something very cold trickled down my spine. 

I stopped walking. “You lied?”

He shrugged. “I had a dig around her office before she caught me a few days ago,” Ben swung his arms, a smile curling on his mouth. “There's no restraining order, but there is prescription anti-psychosis medicine, and an extremely detailed story on her laptop about a teacher/student romance, which I presume is a self insert.” 

Ben shot me a sickly grin. “The school refused to make her condition public.” 

He prodded at his own cotton shirt embroidered with the school emblem. 

“Why do you think she's made all these dumb rules? The woman is a certified Looney Tune.”

I nodded slowly. “Wait. What about Jake and his dad?”

“I made them up.” 

I choked out a laugh. “And… the video?”

Ben walked faster, pulling out his phone and shoving it in my face. The video was real. Principal Marrow was walking around in circles, draped in her nightgown. “It's her own house,” he explained. “She locked herself out.”

Nodding slowly, I was in awe. Bloody Ben was kind of fucking amazing. 

“But the restraining order isn't real.” 

Ben raised a brow, coming to an abrupt halt. It was his smile that cemented his place in my gang. His lack of empathy for a woman he had gaslit into being a disgusting human being. Ben Callows wasn't exactly what I was looking for, but he fascinated me. Maybe for the wrong reasons. “Her filing cabinets are filled with tinned cat food, Panda,” he said with an exaggerated sigh, “I’m not psychic, but I *thiiiiink* we’ll be okay.”

I turned to him, unable to stop myself jumping up and down with excitement. 

“Will you be my *first*?!”

Ben inclined his head. “Will I be your *what*?”

I shook my head. “Sorry. I mean, will you join my mystery gang?”

The boy’s eyes lit up, and I shoved him playfully. 

“To solve *real* cases,” I corrected myself. “Not make them up.”

Ben wore a real, proper smile. But there was something in his eyes, a darkness that was so hollow and polluted and wrong, I pretended not to see it for the sake of his smarts and intellect. “Well, if you *insist,* sure!” Ben held out his hand, and I shook it. I'll be your first.”

We found our second member, who was, *ironically, looking for her glasses* under the table in class. Lucy Prescott, the quiet girl, was born to be with us. 

The class eraser went missing, and she found it in the blink of an eye.

When questioned, Lucy’s face turned as red as her hair. “I asked everyone in the class and followed the clues to the last person who had it,” she pointed to Chase Simpson. “Which was Chase, who was throwing it at Marcus Calvin.”

Twisting around in my chair, I aimed to get Ben’s attention. But he was already looking at me, chin resting on his fist, eyes ignited with excitement. 

The two of us cornered Lucy after class, and when she motioned for us to get back, I dragged Ben (who was a little too excited) to my side. 

Lucy looked mildly horrified when I said, *dangerous cases,* though her expression pricked with intrigue. 

She agreed, her gaze lingering on Ben, cheeks smouldering. 

Our last two members were a surprise. 

Violet Evergreen was what you would call *popular* on the middle school hierarchy. Not just because her mother was the mayor, but because Violet could get away with murder. The girl refused to wear the school uniform, coloring a single purple streak in her hair to cement herself as the *it* girl. 

She was also one of the girls who started the Bloody Ben rumor. 

Ben, Lucy, and I were sitting on the grass during recess, trying to come up with a  name for our detective service, when Violet came storming over, hands planted on her hips. She was copying how her mother held herself during town meetings. 

“What are you doing?” Violet demanded. 

Lucy opened her mouth to answer, Ben nudging her to shut up. 

“Making a mystery gang.” I told her. “Why?”

Violet inclined her head. “Oh.” She folded her arms. “Well, can I join?”

Ben stood up, stepping in front of the girl. Violet didn't move, stubbornly standing her ground. “Sure.” Ben flashed a grin that didn't quite reach his eyes. He stepped closer to her, his smile widening. “If you can pass the test.” 

Violet’s lip curled. She took a single step back. “What *kind* of test?”

Ben nodded to me. “Meet us at the swimming pool at 8pm.”  

To my surprise, Violet nodded. “Do I need to bring anything?”

“Nope!”

8pm. The four of us met outside the local swimming pool. 

Violet was already on the other side of the fence, waving.

“Hey guys!” 

I noticed Ben’s expression, his eyes darkening, lip curling. 

Still though, he maintained positivity, vaulting over the fence. 

“You made it!” 

I followed him, helping Lucy, who was immediately freaking out. I didn't blame her. The pool looked cold and dark, a hollow oblivion carved into the ground. 

Ben and Violet stood on the edge, the two of them shoulder to shoulder. 

Violet Evergreen was braver than I thought. 

Standing with her arms at her sides, Violet's hands clenched into fists. 

“What's the test?” Violet said, her gaze glued to bleeding black depths. 

“I don't know,” Ben murmured, his voice teetering on a giggle. He leaned forwards, arms spread out. “I didn't think you'd actually come meet us.” 

Violet hummed, stretching out her leg, teasing it across the surface. “Was that the test?” 

The boy leaned back. I caught the glint of a grin under the floodlights. “Nah.”

Before I knew what was happening, he shoved Violet into the pool. The girl didn't scream or shriek, she just hit the surface, sinking into pitch dark nothing. 

“Sink or swim,” Ben said in a low murmur, when Violet’s head bobbed under water. I could see her shadow under the surface, imagining the freezing cold depths pulling her down. 

“Drown, and you can't join us.”

It was so quiet, suddenly. The three of us staring into rippling water. 

A minute passed, and my tummy started to twist. 

“Fuck.” Ben’s expression stayed stoic. I wasn't expecting him to say a bad word. 

He cocked his head. “I thought she could swim.”

I hit him, holding in a cry. “You need to get our parents!”

But he didn't listen to me, taking a single step, and dropping into the pool. 

I fell to my knees, scanning the water. 

Lucy was crying. “Are they dead?!” she shrieked. 

“Shhh!” I was watching two shadows lingering under the water. 

Violet broke through. I expected her to be crying, but her expression was unwavering. She was silent. I thought the splashing underneath her was her legs trying and struggling to tread water, before Lucy shoved me. Hard. 

“Panda! What do we do?!”

Looking closer, Violet was perfectly still, her gaze on the sky. 

While she shoved Ben under the water, drowning him. 

Violet’s eyes sparkled, and somehow, I knew she belonged in my gang. 

Her gaze found mine, glinting with that darkness, that poisonous streak I found myself drawn to. It was a starving, insatiable need to understand a fractured mind. Know your enemy. 

“Do you want to see if Ben’s a witch?” Violet asked me, her tone something else entirely. This girl did not make sense, using barely her finger to drown Ben Callows. I knew she was wrong. 

I knew there was something loose, something unlocked and unbridled and drowning inside her mind and heart. 

But I wanted *more* of her. I wanted Violet Evergreen in my detective gang. 

I think that is why I stood there, frozen. 

When the thrashing stopped, Ben broke through. 

He wasn't coughing or spluttering, his head inclined. “You didn't drown.”

Violet climbed out of the pool, offering her hand. “And you're not a witch.”

He declined her hand, taking the steps instead. 

I asked Violet in a shaky voice. I was trembling with terror, but I was excited. 

Exhilarated. 

“Violet, will you join my gang?”

She didn't answer me until we were sharing hot cocoa in my house. 

I told Mom we fell in the pool, and she believed me. I should have told her that my friends were sociopaths, and I was kind of maybe in love. Violet sipped her cocoa, nodding with a smile I didn't recognise. Violet never smiled at school. 

Well, she did. But it was always the prick of a cruel smirk. 

I don't think her smile was genuine, but she was definitely enjoying herself. 

Our last member came to us, instead of finding him. 

Jules Howell, a straggly brunette pushed his way in front of me in the lunch line. I didn't really know the kid. 

He sat at the back of the classroom and slept through most of class. I did like his accent though. 

Jules had moved from Melbourne in the second grade. He didn't talk much. 

When he did, I found myself enveloped in his voice, which sounded like water to me, a bleeding cadence to his tone. 

Jules piled his plate with fries, smiling widely at the lunch ladies. 

“I saw you last night.” He murmured through that perfectly moulded grin.

“Saw me where?” 

“At the pool,” Jules said. “You, Bloody Ben, Violet Evergreen, and that Lucy girl. You were doing a suiciding pact.”

“That's not what we were doing.” I said, “What's a suiciding pact?” 

“When you kill yourself together.” Jules said. “I saw it in a scary movie my Mom was watching.”

I grabbed a fork. “We weren't doing that.”

His eyes were strange when I took the time to notice them. The excited gleam had fizzled out. Jules’s hands tightened around his tray. “Then what *were* you doing?”

I didn't reply, making my way over to our usual table. Ben was already waving me over, Violet and Lucy holding up the flyers we were making. 

**THE REDBLOOD DETECTIVES.”**

**Do YOU need our help? We can find/solve anything! Contact us on the number below. (We take donations!)**

When I bothered turning around, Jules was lost in the crowd of kids. 

We were on our first official case, searching for Mrs Lake’s missing mail, when Jules appeared seemingly out of nowhere. And with him, a golden retriever puppy he introduced as Arlo. 

It took a dog jumping up at them for Violet and Ben to find their real smiles, their real selves slowly seeping through these facades they had built around themselves. Ben dropped to a crouch, ruffling the dog's ears, his smile faint. 

“Who's a good boy?” He chuckled. 

Arlo didn't move, tail wagging, eyes bright. 

Ben motioned the dog towards him, but Arlo stayed put. 

Jules joined us…quietly. 

I don't remember asking him, or even him asking me. 

He just became part of us, side by side with Arlo. 

We soon came to quickly realize that our town was boring. 

There were no monsters or thieves, or soul sucking demons. No criminals or serial killers. Not even one missing person. We did, however, get calls about missing cats. I turned eleven years old, patiently waiting for a murder or a kid going missing. But there was nothing. 

All we did was chase cats, and the occasional dog. Maybe a budgie if we were lucky. Twelve years old, our detective club became a joke. 

The five of us (and Arlo hiding under the table) were trying to pinpoint Mrs Tracy's lost hamster, when three girls came over, dumping their soda all over us. 

We watched crime shows for inspiration on catching killers. 

Ben’s favorite crime was one that happened in the 80’s in our town. 

2 girls murdered. 

Their intestines stuffed into envelopes and mailed to family members. 

“That's what we should be solving,” he told me one night, “Not missing cats.”

Thirteen years old, we lay in Violet’s backyard under the cruel glare of the summer sun. We called it *working* and didn't like to admit it was hanging out, or that we were even friends. However. 

That didn't stop us growing  closer. 

Even if it wasn't quite the way I’d expected. 

I proposed a plan, standing up, wobbling a little off balance. 

“I've got it.” I said, my voice kinda slurry from Violet’s special summer cocktail, which was just random alcoholic beverages we found, thrown into a blender, and diluted with water. 

The town wasn't taking us seriously. 

So, we were going to make our *own* mysteries.

I ordered a full-scale assault on our small town. One that they could not ignore. Ben stamped on Mrs Mason’s flowers, and Lucy threw mud pies at people's cars. Jules trashed the high school gym, and Violet and I spray painted threats and warnings on every store window. Now, this did cause panic, but also an official curfew. 

Thirty minutes before curfew, we met in our usual spot, deep in the forest near the lake. Ben yelled at me when I was three minutes late. He was real passionate about finding a real mystery. 

“You're late.” Ben was sitting on a rock waving a stick in Arlo’s face. 

The dog still wasn't going near him, whining softly. 

I took my place, muttering an apology. “I had to lie to my Mom.”

Violet, sitting with her legs crossed, idly digging her manicure into the dirt, suggested we buy mannequins and masquerade them as dead bodies, hanging them from the school rafters. 

Lucy, who had slowly grown out of her shell, becoming a lot more outspoken, nudged her. “That's a stupid idea.”

The girl groaned, leaning into her. “Urgh. You're right.”

Jules was the only energetic one, standing on the tireswing.

He jumped down, definitely twisting his ankle. 

But his smile only widened, kind of like he *enjoyed* being in pain. 

“Why don't we pretend to be kidnapped?” He said, pulling the hood of his sweatshirt over blondish curls growing out. Jules did a dramatic spin, his eyes shining. “We can ‘go missing’ for like a week, and then when our parents are really scared, we can turn up, and tell them we escaped a kidnapping.” His lips split into a grin.

“And then we solve our *own* kidnapping!”

Ben awkwardly patted Arlos head, only for the dog to pull away with a snort. 

“I like it,” he murmured. “I'm in.”

Jules’s idea was stupid. 

But. 

It was worth a shot. 

The five of us agreed to meet the morning after with enough food and supplies for a week. Then we were going to hike to the next town, and hide out for a week. It was an almost perfect plan, using *ourselves* as victims of our own mystery. 

Packing as much as I could, I kissed my mother goodbye (I told her my pack was for a picnic) and set off to the rendezvous we agreed on.

When I arrived, I was the first one there. I checked and re-checked my pack. 

I waited ten minutes, unable to contain my excitement. 

Then 20 minutes.

It was getting kind of cold. 

One hour. 

I sat on a rock for enough time to watch the sky change color. 

When the clouds were orange, I stood up and stumbled back home. They had gone without me. Mom lectured me when I got home, and I stuck to the plan of pretending my friends had gone missing, even if I they had betrayed me. 

Ben said he'd text me when he arrived at the redervous. I at least expected him to text an explanation, but there was nothing. I was in the dark, and after three days of nothing, our town *finally* began to take us seriously. 

“Our children have been kidnapped!” The adults were screaming. 

Mom was crying in the kitchen, praying to a god I knew she didn't believe in that I wasn't taken next. I was interviewed and stuck with the exact same story I came up with when I was with the others. Our plan was to return after a week, claiming to be locked up in a dark room with a masked man. 

I told my Mother and the other parents that I didn't know where my friends were, repeating the same thing over and over again until I was tongue tied. 

“I saw them the day before they went missing, and… yes, everything seemed okay.” I slowly sipped my glass of milk provided, looking the sheriff directly in the eyes. 

“No, I didn't notice anything suspicious, sheriff. Yes, I'm sure, sir. No, they didn't tell me anything.”

It was Ben’s mother who shattered my mask. 

“Did I know about… what?” I whispered. 

Something warm filled the back of my mouth, foul tasting milk erupting up my throat. I leaned forward, trying to look Mrs Callows in the eye. “No, I… I didn't know about Ben’s…condition.”

Mrs Callows was screaming at me about her son’s *troubled past* when I barfed all over myself, my eyes burning.

In the privacy of my own room, I sobbed until I couldn't breathe. 

I tried to tell Mom, but we had come so close. 

One more day, and the others would be back. 

But that day came. I sat cross legged at our usual spot, which was now covered in police tape. I waited for their thudding footsteps, their laughter congratulating each other for coming up with a great plan. I waited, my face buried in my knees, for my friends. 

It was dark when my phone vibrated, and I'd fallen asleep. 

I wasn't scared, forcing myself to my feet. 

“Where are you?” Mom yelled down the phone.

“Coming home now.” I muttered. 

“Sorry.” I paused, holding my breath against a cry. “Mom.” I broke down, forcing my fist into my mouth to hide my squeak. “Mommy, did they come back?”

Mom didn't reply for a moment. 

“I'm so sorry, baby.” She whispered, ending the call. 

I took my time walking home that night.

There were no stars in the sky.

When a hand clamped over my mouth, I could smell him. 

When he dragged me back, stabbing a kitchen knife into my throat, I stared at the sky and looked for stars. His arms were warm around me, violently pulling me into the back of a pickup truck. The pickup truck he'd said he was bringing. 

It was his grandfather's, and he could *just* about drive it.

Hitting the backseat, my body was numb, my thoughts in a whirlwind. 

The pickup flew forwards, and I remembered how to move. 

I rolled off the seat, my hands pinned behind my back. 

Twisting around, blinking in the dim, I could feel something warm, something seeping across upholstery seats. Blood. 

It was everywhere, sticky on my hands and wet on my face when I struggled to get up. I was lying in someone's blood. 

A scream clawed its way out of my throat. 

The pickup flew over a pothole, and something dropped off the seat.

Arlo’s leash. 

I screamed again, this time his name gritted between my teeth. 

I didn't stop screaming until the jerking movement stopped. The doors opened, pale light hitting me in the face. 

Flashlight. Warm arms wrapped around me, pulling me from the car, and then, pulling me by my hair, into our old tree house. It was always our secret place, our saving grace on the edge of town. 

The flickering candlelight caught me off guard, illuminating my surroundings. 

Two bodies slumped over each other, lying in stemming red.

I felt suffocated, like I was going to die. I screamed, and that warm hand cradled my mouth again, gagging my cries.

Violet and Jules. 

There was something *wrong* with them. And it was only when I forced myself to look closer, when I realized their insides had been carved out, heart, stomach, everything, pulled out. 

There was paper on the floor. 

No, not paper. Envelopes. 

Envelopes stuffed with gore, bright red leaking through white. 

Shuffling back, my brain was too slow to react, while my body was trying to vault to my feet, only to be violently pulled back by my ponytail. 

I felt his fingers twining around my hair, revelling in my screams. 

With another tug, my head was forced forwards. 

Orange candlelight felt almost homely, this time lighting up a third body. 

Lying on their back, curled up, pooling scarlet dried into the floorboards, their wrists restricted with duct-tape. 

I could feel blood underneath me, sticky, a congealing paste. 

“Do you know what happened on October 3rd, 1987, in our town?” 

Lucy Prescott stood over me, her arms folded across her chest. 

I managed to shake my head, when she grabbed Ben’s legs, dragging him under the candlelight. I dazedly watched her stroke the blade of a carving knife, the teeth already stained scarlet. “The intestine murders.” Lucy hummed, tracing the knife down the floorboards. 

“A man murdered two high school girls, carving out their insides and sending their pieces to their loved ones.”

Lucy's eyes found mine, ignited in a familiar gleam. I saw it in Principal Marrow’s office. Then the swimming pool. The cafeteria. “It was the sheriff's only murder case, Panda. Ever since then, our town has been boring. There's no mysteries to solve. Nothing to find.”

The girl jumped to her feet, retrieving a blood stained envelope. 

She held it up, a smile curved on her lips. The girl turned around, and I heard a horrific *squelching* sound. Lucy held up a bright red sausage, ripped into it, and slipped it into the white paper. 

“But I can change that.” she said, in a giggle. 

“I can create a *real* serial killer, who we can hunt down together.”

Lucy stabbed the blade into the floor, laughing.

“Or! I can bring a fan-favorite back! I can bring the intestine killer back from the dead!”

Her gaze flicked to the others. “There are casualties, of course. The story is, I was kidnapped with Ben, Violet, and Jules. The *scary intestine killer* killed them, and I managed to get away.”

Lucy shuffled over to me, her eyes wide. “Then! He came back and struck again!”

With those words, she shoved me onto my back. 

“First he took Violet,” Lucy hummed, tracing the blade down my shirt. 

“Then… Jules.” I squeezed my eyes shut, pulling at the restraints around my wrists. “Then Ben.” her breath tickled my cheek. “And finally… Panda.”

Lucy lifted the knife, and I accepted my death.

Until a low rumble in my ears. 

*Shouting.*

Thundering footsteps, followed by the pitter-patter of paws. 

“Lucy!” The sheriff was screaming, and the girl stumbled to her feet, the knife slipping from her fingers. Lucy stumbled, tripping over Ben’s body.

“He got away!” she shrieked. “He…he  killed them! Oh, god, please help me!”

I don't think Lucy even realised the traces she'd left behind. 

The blood slick on her fingers, her manic, grinning smile full of mania. 

I was looking for stars when an officer crouched over me. 

I couldn't understand what she was saying. 

Her voice was white noise. 

*“Rachel? Hey, try and sit up, honey. You Mom is on her way.”*

Instead of listening to her, I curled into myself. 

My gaze found Arlo sticking his nose in Ben’s hair, trying to nudge the boy awake. 

I didn't fully register the next few days. 

They went by in a confusing blur. 

Part of me tried to eat, and spent hours with my head pressed against the toilet seat. 

I could still see the slithering, scarlet remains of my friends every time I closed my eyes. There was so much red, soaked in that hunting orange light. 

Blood that I could still see, a starless sky that stretched on forever. 

Weeks went by. 

Then months. 

I think I turned 14. I wasn't sure. I didn't feel alive anymore. 

I stood at my friend’s funerals with a single rose I dropped into their casket. 

Violet’s mother was quick to cover the whole thing up.

Lucy's plan didn't work after all. 

Our town’s murder cases stayed stagnant at **one**. 

It's been four years since my friends were murdered by our *’Velma’*. 

Now, at seventeen, Mom asked if I wanted to visit Lucy in juvie. 

I'm not even upset or angry anymore. 

I want to know *why*.

Ben picked me up. Arlo was at his side, wagging his tail. 

Ben was…different. He'd dumped his baseball cap and gotten a haircut, swapping his old wardrobe of drab colors for an attempt at changing style. 

That day, he looked awkward in a short sleeved tee and shorts. 

At school, Ben is no longer Bloody Ben. 

Now, he is Survivor Ben. 

I’m *still* Panda. 

Every time I was with him, I felt like my soul was being sucked out. 

Guilt so deep, so fucking painful, I lost my breath. 

I live knowing that I immediately assumed it was *him* that day. 

Ben was barely alive when I found him. Lucy had started to carve into him before remembering she needed me. 

After admitting it to him, his lips formed a small smile. 

*“Can I tell you a secret?”* He said to me, at sixteen. 

*""Yeah?""* 

Whatever he was going to say, Ben never told me. 

Presently, I nodded at the dog’s new collar.

“Peppa Pig themed?” 

The boy shrugged, ruffling Arlo’s ears. “FYI, *he* chose it.”

“It's cute.” I said. “Very… chic.”

We didn't speak the whole ride, but Ben did entangle his hand in mine. 

We spent half an hour outside the detention centre. I was panicking, and Ben was trying to hide that he was panicking. In the end, we joined hands, and strode through the doors together. 

Lucy greeted us with a wide smile. Just as psychotic. 

The orange jumpsuit suited her, though I had zero idea why. 

“Hey Arlo!” she giggled at the dog, and Ben pulled the pup onto his lap.

“Ben.” She sighed. “I wish I got to finish you. I would have loved to solve the mystery of your gutted corpse.”

Ben’s smile was wry. “Nice to see you too.”

Behind a glass screen, I asked Lucy one simple question. 

“Why?”

Lucy didn't reply. Or she did, but it was just nonsensical bullshit. 

But there was one thing she said has stuck with me, chilling me to the core. 

I am fucking terrified of Lucy. Of what's she's done, and what she's *capable* of doing. 

It was a throwaway line, and I don't even think Ben noticed. 

Or he did, and was in denial. 

Lucy's smile was wide, her eyes empty pools of nothing. 

The exact same glint in Ben’s eyes. 

Jules’s eyes. 

Violet’s eyes. 

Like something was gnawing away at their psyche, twisting and contorting it, filling them with darkness, poison, that was so vast, so endless, I had craved it as a child. I still don't know what *it* is. 

But I'm going to *find* it. 

Lucy's laugh was shrill, and next to me, Ben didn't move a muscle.

I was in an abusive relationship where I found comfort in gaming. I met an awesome friend group. We gamed 24:7. I found myself particularly fond of one of my friends. He was sweet. Encouraged me to see my worth, to leave my relationship. We talked everyday for two years. As you can imagine, it got emotional, and sometimes spicy. We had an undeniable connection. He lived 6 hours away so it was only through a phone we communicated. We met once and had a great time. I found myself wanting to have a relationship with him. I expressed that many times. But he wasn’t in a place to want that but still had a lot of feelings for me. I eventually left my abusive relationship, healed and moved on to a man I grew up around. After two years of being in this relationship he randomly left me. I was distraught. This was my first healthy relationship after a horrible relationship. A month after we separated I called my gamer friend. We caught up with each other, talked about how life has been for the past few years and had great conversation. I thought our relationship would be like it always was, I would always want more from him, and he would always deny me. But we would be great friends with some spicy benefits through the phone. All of the sudden he asked me about marriage and kids and where I saw myself in the future. We shared the same feelings on what we wanted. It was totally different talking to him this time. He wanted a relationship, where I told him I wanted to be friends seeing I just got out of a relationship and was pretty heartbroken. But still would think about the idea. I loved talking to him. I loved how much he cared about me. We would talk all the time, but I always made it clear about where I stood. About a month of reconnecting I took a week long vacation and drove 6 hours to spend the week off with him. I was extremely depressed and wanted to get away. We had a great time. Many long conversations in person that we never got to have. He cuddled me, brought me coffee in bed, went the extra mile to make me feel better. A few weeks after I came home, me and my ex met up and talked about our falling out. After a 10 hour conversation we decided to slowly try to work things out. I communicated this to my friend. He then dropped a bomb on how he was and always has been in love with me. And that as hard as it is for him to see me with someone else, he ultimately just wants me to be happy. He blocked me on everything…. Which I get. But he was more than a spicy evening. He was my friend for many years of the darkest parts of my life. I know he is hurting, but I was following my heart and what my gut told me to do. I keep finding myself thinking about him after months of not speaking. Just wanting to tell him I never meant to hurt him. If I knew he would have felt that way I would have never reached out, seeing I was in no place for love.

There was some short term dating in between, but nothing longer than a few months. All of my relationships were initiated by the woman so I've never actually went out to meet someone. My previous 3-year relationship ended early 2023 and after some time focusing on myself I have attempted to re-enter the dating landscape with no success. 

First off, where the hell is everyone? I moved to Las Vegas at the beginning of this year for work and I can't seem to find other people my age. The advice I've heard is to do your hobbies and you'll meet people. I go to parks, coffee shops, book stores, libraries, outdoor malls and I go all over china town to eat at the various restaurants. There are no single people anywhere! Its all families, couples or completely empty. 

I don't drink or club and I work in a job where I can't do any drugs or use marijuana so instantly I'm ""disqualified"" for many peoples tastes. Everyone at my job are also mid to late forties men so that is not an option. I have plenty friends but they are typically late 20's to early 30's and are all in long term committed relationships or married.

He makes me feel bad by telling me that I don’t really work out or do any form of cardio and that I mostly eat sugar and processed foods.

But I cannot live like this.  I feel my depression will get worse if I eat healthier and he says that’s ridiculous because healthy body will inherently make my brain healthier as well.

I got upset and cried because he says I should commit to a healthier diet, and that it’s worrying him how I eat.  

He said he will sit with me and actually comment on what I ate so here are the example of yesterday

Morning

Coffee with 5 tablespoons of brown sugar 2 eggs made with olive oil, and Dunkin’ Donuts chocolate milk small one.  He commented that’s a lot of sugar and he said instead of chocolate milk eat a tangerine.

Afternoon. I ate what he made me which was grilled lamb with onions but I couldn’t just eat with salt and pepper so I put some eel sauce (which he says it’s processed and sugary), soy sauce, I added 2 slices of cheese (he said it’s processed) and with some rice which I also added some eel sauce and soy sauce

Drank 3 cans of Coca Cola (which is unusual for me).

Dinner I made pasta with 30% fat cream, sour cream, bacon and onions.  Which he says it’s just not good to eat like this. 

Then before bed I ate a bowl of Oreo cereal and 2 kinder bars.

He said I need to be eating Whole Foods 80% of the time and 20% of the time I can eat anything I want.

He’s literally obsessed with this health thing and i know it’s not normal the way he is and his defense everytime is “im obsessed because im eating Whole Foods 80% of the time?”  And has an attitude.

It’s really getting to me, I did promise him ill try to eat healthier, but I cannot eat like him.  He literally eats eggs avocados cooked in some organic butter with salt pepper and avoids breads, flour, refined sugar like the plague.  He said I don’t have to follow exactly but I should be avoiding processed food 80% of the time, and get the body moving.  He says I don’t have to gym but atleast a 30 minute walk daily would do wonders for me but I’m just too tired.

But I learned some things

Namely, you can automate delivering cupcake stands by putting a cupcake stand on a grabber or conveyer sharing a side with a table., this probably also works for ketchup in hotdogs runs. The item will stay on the conveyer, meaning that you don't have to clear an extra item, or instantly move it to a new area.

Honestly this gives a use case for base conveyors  that is really good, and not clear from the conveyer page itself.

Copy Machines are really good. Being able to get a copy of something without further rerolls is really good, and compared to a blueprint station, where you need to get an upgraded blueprint to double the impact of getting the first one, you just need more blueprint cabinets.

Blueprint stations are ... kinda eh, given a lot of good things are upgraded blueprints, and that's the one pool that the blueprint station doesn't tap into.

Also, you don't get hobs or sinks in black coffee only recipe runs except for a random wash basin in the upgraded pools. (I think salad runs are similar for hobs)

 Mostly this is good, but this makes my compostable bin kinda a waste of an upgrade, because I can't cook anything.

Finally, you can move around blueprint cabinets without causing them to lose any blueprints (including their 1 copy)  by holding a seperate blueprint/crate and pressing grab. Turns what with empty hands would pull out a blueprint into a swap. This is mostly a prep phase time step without the copy machine, but with the copy machine, you can avoid pulling out copies for no reason that you can't put back into a cabinet. 

Finally, it doesn't matter the order in which you copy/upgrade/discount a blueprint cabinet, the results are the same.",0,1729654467.0,PlateUp,1,0.33,False

My kids' enthusiasm matched mine – until the Ramblers started leaking everywhere. Couches, beds, cars, and carpets became unintended recipients of refreshing cold water. The spout's position didn't matter; closed or open, leaks persisted. My initial excitement turned to frustration.

Assuming the premium price would guarantee durability and functionality, I didn't scrutinize the fine print. But now, I question why a $30 Rambler isn't leak-proof, regardless of spout position. YETI's expertise in high-quality coolers makes this oversight surprising.

Seeking feedback avenues, I found limitations on YETI's website. Concerned parents should know: these Ramblers aren't ideal for kids due to leakage risks. I attempted to contact YETI but found no intuitive channels. The warranty process felt cumbersome, requiring credit card information for a temporary hold on a replacement.

Daily reminder emails from YETI, urging me to return the warranty Rambler, added to my disappointment. I had intended to send it back after receiving the replacement, but the constant notifications made me feel like a potential fraudster.

At this price point, I expect more from YETI. Here's constructive feedback:

A YETI Enthusiast's Disappointment: When Premium Meets Practicality

1. Clarify product expectations for child-friendly usage.
2. Consider design enhancements for improved durability.
3. Streamline communication channels for concerns.
4. Reevaluate warranty processes to prioritize trust.

I hope YETI takes this feedback to heart, addressing these concerns to reclaim their place in my heart. Until then, I'll fall back on the 12$ contigo.

1ga0zgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HallmarkMovies/comments/1ga0zgz/a_sprinkle_of_deceit_a_hannah_swensen_mystery/,A Sprinkle of Deceit: A Hannah Swensen Mystery; ,"Apparently, Hannah Swensen is just a baker at heart. Also it was good to see Moishe again. Not enough cats in these movies.  I have to say I did enjoy it though. We are moving along in the Hannah and Chad relationship a bit. Now they have plans for a date. He is a bit serious but she is warming him up a little. I figured out the killer when I saw the phone said ""B"" on it. Also they just talked about leaving and I don't think anyone else saw them leave. Well, why would they leave? I mean if someone did see her or him leave then that would have been just a tad odd. Once again Hannah and her sweets are the way to get information. Not for the legal eagle Chad though. But I liked how the first person easily bribed was a mere lad of 10. Yep, children are easily bribed with food. So are some adults too. I know I would be when it comes to some things. It's funny how they talked about the changes at the Cookie Jar. Yeah, they got coffee and seems to be more like a cafe but the previous place was bigger and they had more tables but I digress. Sure, they want to bring in the coffee crowd. I get that. Just cracked me up. Also Hannah should probably have her murder board a little bit more out of the view of customers. That's just weird and just not a good vibe. ""Come to the Cookie Jar. We have macaroons and a murder board."" Yeah, not good. 

Well, it must be said that even now Delores is starting to annoy me although I did enjoy some of her jokes. Maybe in an eye-rolling way. But her character is getting very broad. Even campy, one might say. She literally did find the perfect ""role"" to play though in this movie.  I still don't get how she can play detective in a small town that knows her so well. I guess people will just call her 'nosy"" but a perfect thing to do would be dumpster diving but she seems to be quite adverse to that. I mean it's not that big. I must correct that. Apparently, it's in two counties, Stearns and Lake Eden. I guess it's like the actual seat of Stearns County, St. Cloud. Anyway, just something I noticed. There were literally big signs in the movie noting the counties. The mystery was good. A little bit wonky. Maybe not wonky but I liked how they talked about the issues with a civilian providing help. Nice of the sheriff to compliment Hannah and her ""skills"". I remember her not being on such friendly terms with a previous sheriff. Speaking of, I miss Bill. I mean it's great having Andrea there but Bill was good too. The sisters' weren't as good as in previous movies I felt. It just lacked a bit of a spark at times. Loved that one scene with the actress who was crying her eyes out because someone accidentally walked into her on the set. Boy, she was a sourpuss. Ha ha. Well, she had good reason. There was blood! Anyway, brava, Ashley. That's the  type of cameo I like. That was hilarious. I do like those scenes in movies or tv shows where they are filming something and someone accidentally walks into a scene. I mean who would figure that in ""Lake Eden"". they would be filming a tv commercial even if it was mostly on a stage? Seems a bit odd that one. Darcy must have gotten into the champagne already before causing a racket with the Williams sister. 

So overall, a good but not great entry into the Hannah Swensen series. I'm glad to see that she and Chad are moving along. Yes, Lisa sometimes saves Hannah's butt indeed. Not to mention she pretty much runs the Cookie Jar while our heroine is out investigating. Lisa should get a raise! I liked that line about having a Cookie Jar sign on her car. That makes it harder to do some surveilling. Yeah, no kidding. At least it's not the Oscar Meyer Wienermobile cruising the streets of Lake Eden. It's also orange. Yeah, I figured there wouldn't be too many convertibles in Lake Eden. Reminds me of the jeep we see in the opening credits of Mork & Mindy. Apparently, Mindy McConnell is a hardy soul to drive around Boulder in an open jeep like that. I mean beyond maybe three months a year. She's a brave one, that Mindy. But I digress. Anyway, a good film but not a great one. Some aspects of it were lacking. The sisters together could have been better. Delores was just too much at times. Maybe a bit more romance in the future for Hannah and Chad. Chad? I just don't see him as a Chad but maybe that's just me. Names have connotations. Victor is not a ""Chad"" for me. I hope the next one will be better.

Here’s why:

	1.	Franchise Model and Cost Control: Tim Hortons benefits from a highly franchised business model. This limits its exposure to operating costs while allowing it to collect franchise fees and royalties. It also benefits from passing on rising commodity costs to franchisees, maintaining profitability even when customers aren’t fully satisfied ￼ ￼.
	2.	Brand Loyalty and Market Dominance: In Canada, Tim Hortons still enjoys significant brand loyalty and a large market share in the fast-food coffee segment. Despite mixed reviews, many Canadians continue to frequent it for convenience, and this steady foot traffic helps maintain sales ￼.
	3.	Expansion and Modernization: The company continues to open new locations and invest in modernizing its stores, which drives sales growth. Even with some dissatisfaction, new marketing initiatives and remodeled stores can temporarily boost foot traffic and average sales per location ￼.
	4.	Effective Cost-Shifting: While franchisees may bear the brunt of customer complaints (slow service, lower quality), Tim Hortons shifts costs effectively. This allows the parent company to remain profitable, even when public perception might be suffering ￼ ￼.

So, while some customers may feel disappointed, Tim Hortons’ strong business fundamentals and strategic moves keep its EBITDA rising.",0,1729653686.0,TimHortons,1,0.5,False

E. Percival Baker Takes His Life, While His Wife’s Attempt Proves a Failure

WOMAN IS FOUND DYING

Under Assumed Names They Register at the St. Lawrence Hotel and Take Chloroform

E. Percival Baker is dead and his wife, Natalie Baker, is at death’s door, as a result of an attempt at double suicide. It is thought that the pair took chloroform with the intention of killing themselves. The attempt at self-destruction was made early this morning at the room occupied by Baker and his wife in the St. Lawrence lodging house, corner Seventh and Main streets.

When discovered this morning, Baker was dead and rigor mortis had set in. The woman was breathing spasmodically and it was apparent that a few minutes later she would have joined her husband. Prompt restorative measures were adopted and the physicians now have hopes of saving the life of Mrs. Baker.

There is doubt both as to the cause for the rash deed of the pair and as to the method adopted for ending their existence.

E. Percival Baker had won more or less notoriety recently by securing a photograph of the foot of a Chinese woman in Los Angeles, impersonating an officer in order to accomplish his object. For representing himself as a government official, he was arrested and prosecution was begun in the federal court. The case still is pending, due to Baker’s repeated motions for postponement because of alleged illness. It is known that Baker was greatly worried as to the result of this trial and it is thought that this may have been one reason for his determination to end his life.

Had Contemplated Suicide

There is no doubt but that Baker had been contemplating suicide for several days at least, and that he went to the St. Lawrence with that object in view. He was a nervous wreck from excessive use of opium, and it is believed that his wife was also addicted to the drug.

For several months Baker and his wife had been rooming with Mrs. John Haxton of 315 Winston street, but Sunday evening they put in an appearance at the St. Lawrence house, saying that they had been recommended to the house as a quiet place, where they could be undisturbed. Baker explained that his wife had been suffering from earache for several nights, and had been unable to sleep, and for that reason they had concluded to change their place of residence for a few days until his wife had recovered.

Mrs. Westerbury, the landlady, was not prepossessed in favor of the couple, but as the woman looked tired out, she finally told them that they could have a small room on the third floor just over her own, and they at once retired without registering.

Next day the landlady called at the room and saw the woman, who said that she had a good night’s rest and felt much better, and that afternoon, as the woman had had nothing to eat, she took her a cup of coffee.

When the landlady first went upstairs in the morning she found two letters outside the door with the following note:

“Landlady—Please mail these and let us sleep until we awaken.

‘MR. AND MRS. STANLEY.’”

During the afternoon both Baker and his wife appeared to be more cheerful, and nothing more was thought of them until evening, when Mrs. Haxton called and inquired if Mr. and Mrs. Baker were in the house.

Friends Had Warning

The landlady told her there were no people by that name stopping in her house, but mentioned the Stanleys, and Mrs. Haxton then told her that she had received a letter from them that day, and she thought they intended to commit suicide, but cautioned her against telling them of her suspicions.

Mrs. Haxton went to the room and remained but a short time, and when she left Mrs. Westerbury lost no time in calling upon her lodgers for an explanation. Both Baker and his wife denied having any thoughts of suicide, and after some delay the landlady left the room satisfied that all was safe.

Last evening Professor Melville Dozier of the normal school and R. M. Close called upon Baker and his wife, and remained until about 12 o’clock, when they left.

As late as 2 o’clock this morning the landlady heard Baker talking to his wife, apparently trying to soothe her, but Mrs. Westerbury, thinking that the woman was still suffering from her earache, finally dropped off to sleep herself when the talking ceased.

Bodies Are Discovered

Early this morning, Professor Dozier and Mr. Close again called at the house, and on knocking at the door and receiving no response, got the landlady’s pass key and opened the door, when the dead body of Baker, partially dressed, was discovered stretched out on the bed, and his wife lying by his side unconscious but breathing heavily. The woman had a sheet twisted tightly about her throat, and this was hurriedly removed and she was taken to the receiving hospital, where energetic measures were taken to revive her, with such success that although at noon she was still unconscious, the physicians in charge were hopeful of her recovery.

There were any number of bottles in the room, including a two-ounce vial which contained chloral, and this is believed to have been the poison used. There was also a bottle which had contained chloroform and another bottle of chloroform liniment, which the woman evidently had used for her earache. The room was littered up, and Baker had spent almost all night writing letters, many of which had been torn up, as a pile of papers was found on the dresser.

After destroying these letters Baker had started in to write his farewell mes sages, taking the chloral in copious doses as he proceeded.

One of these letters, addressed to the coroner, is as follows:

“To the Coroner: I have inclosed in an envelope herewith four silver dollars, the property of Mr. and Mrs. John Haxton of 315 Winston street, this city. I have written this that you will have the money. Please hand it back to them. Respectfully,
E. PERCY BAKER.”

The money referred to was found in an envelope which had been sealed and then torn open, and but was two words which would indicate that Baker had been short of money and probably tore it up and took it, as probably to purchase the chloral, as but two copper cents were found in his purse.

Then came the following, addressed to Customs Inspector Putnam, on the back of the folder note:

“Putnam: I have appealed my case to a court which never makes errors, and I die believing that I will be exonerated when the spirit of God is to judge. You did not believe I was wronged, but all will come right some time. BAKER.”

On a slip of paper written in a shorthand was the following:

“In a few minutes President Roosevelt will be President, sending full power to the priests and make priests put on by themselves, to appoint priests at the start in Sunday Times Magazine.”

Then came the following, written in a faltering hand, evidently intended for his wife: “Mrs. J. P. Baker, Harlem, Iowa (Shelby county).”

“Dear Mother: It is my great probability to die suddenly, and I must probably become subject to a care,” and the letter ends abruptly.

At this point the writing becomes almost illegible, but as near as can be made out, it continues as follows: “Yes,” and she said aloud and took the powder filled up another glass. Yes, she will be with me. Good-bye.” In a corner of the table sheet a woman’s name is written, showing which closes the pitiful record of the case.

“Yes, my true love, I come also. Amen and comes. Death—ever—yet.” From this letter it would appear that the man and woman talked over the matter together, and that it was Baker’s intention to kill himself and get out of the way, and that the woman had promised to remain alive and notify the authorities, when she saw that her husband had taken the fatal dose, she determined to join him, and after adding her postscript to the farewell letter, had unconsciousness attempted to suffocate herself with the sheet around her neck. The two men were stupefied when they forced open the door and saw the bodies, for they say it was not the first time they had discovered before the chloroform had time to operate.

This morning Professor Dozier and Mr. Close called at the police station, and from them it was learned that the people of the First Baptist church had been assisting Baker and his wife for several months, and endeavoring to get him on his feet. It was said Baker was trying to break himself of the opium habit and his friends were trying to assist him.

Mr. Close said last night he and Professor Dozier had called to see Baker as they were afraid he intended to kill himself, from the letter which he had written to Professor Dozier during the day. Mr. Close said when they first went to Baker’s room he appeared to be very despondent, but after they had talked to him and promised to secure bondsmen for him he cheered up and turned over to them all the opium and other poisons that he had in his room, and promised to meet them this morning at 10 o’clock.

Mr. Close said that Baker was greatly worried over the prospect of being locked up, as his bondsmen had declared their intention of surrendering him, and he told them that if an officer came after him he was prepared to kill himself before their eyes, and would do so before he would go to jail. They told him to cheer up and said they would have the bondsmen for him this morning.

During the evening Mr. Close said Baker and his wife talked considerably to each other in the Chinese language, and of course he could not tell what they were saying.

Baker came to Los Angeles two or three years ago, and at first dabbled in oil, but soon dropped out that business, and devoted himself to looking after the interests of Chinese, and wrote for the papers. Since his trouble he has done nothing, and owing to his ill-health has been, to a certain extent, dependent on charity.

Baker always claimed to have occupied a responsible position under the government, the exact nature of which he never would disclose. He also claimed to have traveled all over the world, and he had a scrap book full of letters of recommendation from prominent people all over the country. He said he could go to work any time he would go to Washington, but for some reason he would not leave Los Angeles.

When he first came here he was arrested once on a petty charge and was tried in the police court, being fined a small amount, which he paid.

Coroner Holland has not yet decided when he will hold the inquest (Los Angeles Evening Express, April 15, 1902, Page 1-2. via Newspapers.com (https://www.newspapers.com/article/los-angeles-evening-express/157658265/: accessed October 22, 2024).",18,1729652396.0,DeathCertificates,10,0.95,False

I'm a huge fan of buying vintage/secondhand stuff but found it more and more hard to find items that matched my preferences... it got annoying looking through a bunch of sites like eBay, poshmark, and Mercari for the same items with the same requirements

so for a class design project I made Encore, a free app that searches from hundreds of secondhand sites at once to show you results in one page (clothing, anything vintage, jewelry work well)

it tries to show the most relevant results without google's ads and you can also choose what sites you want to look from (in case you wanna just see results from certain sites)

try it out here: [trysecondhand.com](https://chat.shopencore.ai/) (this currently goes to our encore link but it's a work in progress :)

you can basically talk to it like a fashion sidekick :) it even looks thru more lowkey sites other search doesn’t prioritize! I hope this helps any of you find something cool <3 would love any thoughts/feedback/improvements!

1ga0fur,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ga0fur/sf_the_last_undecided_voter/,[SF] The Last Undecided Voter,"Maisy Springer woke to the hum of the press outside her home. The number of journalists had grown exponentially as the day approached. She started her morning routine, trying to block out the constant noise.

It was voting day. About a week ago, the first few reporters arrived, cameras poised, waiting.

“Who will you be voting for, Ms. Springer?” they yelled trampling on her flowering shrubs and knocking over her plant pots.

“Why haven’t you decided yet?” And that was the crux of it. Maisy hadn’t decided.

On the kitchen counter, her phone buzzed with another notification: “Good morning, Maisy! Your voting appointment is at 11:15 AM! Don’t be late!”

She dismissed the alert with a flick of her wrist. Her stomach churned.

She always voted. Voting was her duty as a citizen of a democracy. That’s what she’d been taught as a child.

“Every vote counts.”

She’d always voted. Always. Voting was her duty.

She believed it then. She believed it when she cast her first vote. The vote for that candidate who promised universal healthcare. But she also remembered how that turned out. The insurance companies got rich, and hospitals closed.

She believed it when she voted for the politician who vowed to clean up the city’s water supply. Maisy could still taste the metal in her tap water.

She continued to believe in democracy when she voted for the politician who sowed fear between neighbors. Even after major neighborhood re-zoning to contain recent immigrants, she hesitated to let her cat roam outside.

Standing in her kitchen, the press buzzing like flies outside her door, Maisy wasn’t so sure she believed anymore.

She flicked on the news feed on her phone. The familiar front of her house, over-run with press, beamed back to her.

Maisy clutched her mug of coffee for warmth. A chill settled into her bones. The bitter aroma filled her nostrils, a small comfort amidst the chaos outside. Her phone buzzed again — another message from her sister.

“Hey sis, you okay? Saw the news vans outside your place. Why didn’t you just use *mAIL* like everyone else?”

Maisy sighed. If only…

When she was younger, she’d waited for hours in long lines to cast her vote. Sometimes she chose the candidate with the loveliest smile, or the one who had left a nice flyer in her mailbox. Once, she’d voted for a man who shook her hand and carried her groceries at the supermarket. Mostly, though, she voted for the person who sounded most like a politician. That was the job after all. To act and behave like a politician. But what did that mean?

Voting lines used to stretch down the block. People patiently waited, full of hopeful chatter and neighbors catching up. People clutched pamphlets filled with candidates’ promises. But over the years, the lines shrank. Voting became a marathon of red tape. You needed photo IDs, proof of address, birth certificates. Waiting for hours in the scorching sun or freezing cold was more tense. Hours dragged by only to be told the machines were down or the polls had closed. And voting wasn’t just inconvenient; it was dangerous.

Polling places became battlegrounds. Armed protesters, shouting threats, stood outside while voters faced the gauntlet of security checks, biometric scans, and affidavits. Most people bypassed the craziness and violence between warring political parties, choosing instead to vote by “mAIL.”

“AIL” or AI Algorithms were the natural extension of polling. In the past, huge amounts of money was spent each election cycle asking people how they would vote. Pollsters tried to predict the election results, gambling on the outcome. But polling was inaccurate and incomplete. Most people were too busy to answer the lengthy surveys, or the surveys so poorly constructed as to be nonsense.

As AI algorithms advanced, they began replacing the polls. The AI didn’t have to ask questions. The AI already knew everything about everyone. It knew their educational background, their job, how much money they made. The AI knew what you bought at the grocery store last Tuesday and what political posts you’d liked on social media.

Eventually, the AI became so advanced that it knew how each person would vote.

Her phone buzzed with a recommendation for a new doctor’s office near her house. She didn’t remember searching for it. But she hadn’t needed to. The AI had picked up her frustration last week when she complained to Siri about the long wait times at her current clinic. It was always listening, always curating her life before she could even think to ask.

There had been a time when Maisy resented the intrusion. But now it was just part of life. From her smart fridge suggesting recipes based on her last grocery delivery to the targeted ads that knew exactly when she needed new shoes. Why would voting be any different?

It didn’t take long before the AI could predict how each person would vote. And that was how *mAIL* proxy voting began.

Of course, there was outrage at first, resistance to the new *mAIL* technology. Everyone liked to believe they were unique. But the AI knew better. Every product purchased, every news article skimmed, it all funneled into the system. People were predictable.

One by one, people realized that, like every other technology, it made life easier. If the AI already knew how you would vote, you could simply check a box and let the AI cast a vote for you. It was the logical step.

As AI took over the mundane task of voting, it quickly became clear that the lengthy and costly campaigns were obsolete. The shift was seismic.

The AI’s ability to predict and cast votes meant that the usual efforts to sway the electorate were unnecessary. Campaigns shortened, spending decreased, and the electorate sighed in collective relief at being spared the usual spiel.

Voters no longer had to listen to politicians who promised everything and delivered nothing. No one believed any of the politicians anyway. They spoke in well-rehearsed phrases carefully curated by focus groups. Politicians couldn’t stop the hurricanes or make you happier. They weren’t going to fix your car or make your children love you.

Now, voting was just another algorithm — like scrolling through TV streaming options that AI had already sorted.

And Maisy? Maisy didn’t fit the algorithm. It was an odd thing, really. Maybe the AI couldn’t figure her out because she herself didn’t know where she stood. One election, she was an optimist, ready to believe in change. The next, a cynic, casting her vote with indifference. Her opinions drifted like leaves in the wind, shifting with the news cycle, with her mood, with the state of the world. How could an algorithm predict that? Her eclectic habits and changing moods defied easy categorization, her voting history a tapestry of contradictions.

The last undecided voter. That’s what they were calling her. As if her indecision was something important, something powerful. But Maisy didn’t feel powerful. She felt like a failure. Everyone else had made up their minds, even if they didn’t care. Why couldn’t she?

A knock at her front door diverted her attention away from a crossword puzzle.

“Yes?” she opened her front door a bit suspiciously. Standing on her stoop was a well-dressed woman in sharply nails and high heels.

“Ms. Springer?”

Maisy nodded.

“I have a visitor for you.” She moved aside to reveal an equally well-coiffed man in an impeccably expensive suit. The politician flashed a polished smile at her.

“I’m running to be your representative in Washington,” he said in a smooth, well-rehearsed voice.

She hadn’t seen this man before, but he looked the part. Maisy’s insides did a little leap.

“Come in,” she said politely, moving into her living room and straightening an already perfectly placed pillow. This man seemed too big for her little world.

As he stepped inside, his polished shoe caught on the threshold — a brief stumble, quickly corrected but distinctly human. His face showed annoyance for only a millisecond before it was replaced by his political mask.

“Lovely to meet you, Ms. Sprangler,” he said, smothering her hand in both of his massive palms. She winced at the mangling of her name but said nothing. Behind him, three impressively dressed aides squeezed into the small space.

“I’ve come to find out how I, your next representative in Washington, can help you.”

Maisy thought about the question embedded in the statement. What could this man really do for her? She didn’t know what to say. But that was ok. He didn’t wait for her response.

She listened as Sinclair rambled about taxes and social services. Yes, she agreed. It would be nice to have another park. And yes, she had been struggling to get an appointment with her doctor. Yes. Things were getting more difficult as she aged. He did sound the part. Could this large man make a difference in her small life?

She couldn’t remember the name of the candidate running against this brash man in her living room. It was a woman, Maisy thought. Someone loud and foul mouthed. Pretty though.

As he spoke, Maisy felt herself softening. His smile was confident, his words were practiced, but they had a way of sounding just right. Maybe this man *could* help. She’d listen a little longer. She should have offered him coffee.

She felt herself leaning toward him — maybe she’d vote for this man.

But then, mid-sentence she saw him flick a glance to the cameras pressed against her picture window. In that millisecond, the spell shattered. Maisy realized, with a familiar sinking feeling, that she’d been nothing more than a pit stop on his campaign trail.

Maybe it would be best after all to vote for a woman this time.

He soon left with his entourage, the press clamoring as he exited, shouting questions about this scandal or that. Wondering if his financial troubles were behind him.

Eventually, the commotion died down, and all was quiet hum again.

Maisy picked up the official voting summons from her desk, its embossed weight far greater than the paper it was printed on.

“You are required to report to your polling place at 11:15 a.m. promptly.”

She’d considered not voting at all this election. It would be the first time in her adult life that she hadn’t voted. But then the summons arrived. Not everyone received a summons to vote. But Maisy had. This was the by-product of voting by *mAIL*.

As the voices outside grew louder, Maisy realized she couldn’t put it off any longer. It was nearly time to face her decision.

A sudden cheer from outside made her jump, coffee sloshing over the rim of her mug. A news anchor’s voice cut through the noise.

“As we enter the final hours of this historic election, all eyes are on the ‘Undecideds’. With *mAIL* predicting an even 50/50 split, it’s a political deadlock. This last vote will tip the scales…”

She was *the* one. The last undecided voter.

The thought gnawed at her.

*This is your responsibility,* she told herself, staring at the voting summons. *You always vote. You’ve always believed it matters.* But as soon as the thought formed, doubt crept in.

The journalists outside acted like her decision could change the world. But would it? Maisy struggled with the sinking feeling deep inside. Whoever she chose, would it matter? They were all the same, the polished candidates, the empty promises. It was all noise. No one *really* believed the politicians anymore, did they?

*Will anything change because of me?*

She carefully brushed her hair and made sure she looked nice for the cameras. Taking a deep breath, Maisy opened her front door and stepped out trying to ignore the cacophony.

The press pressed forward, surrounding her like a tidal wave. They yelled her name and pressed microphones into her face. Their voices blended into a discordant chorus of desperation.

“Ms. Springer! Who are you voting for?”

“Maisy! Give us a hint!”

“What’s your stance on the economy?”

“Is it true you’re leaning towards the independent candidate?”

Maisy kept her eyes forward, ignoring their pleas. She could feel their frustration palpable in the air, an almost electric current of anxiety. The press was uncomfortable not knowing something, and Maisy was the ultimate unknown, a black box in their world of predictive algorithms and data-driven certainties.

As she walked to her sensible hybrid car, she could hear them speculating wildly, grasping at straws, each trying to outdo the other with a potential scoop.

“I heard she’s voting based on a coin flip!”

“My sources say she’s writing in her own candidate!”

“She must have inside information we don’t know about!”

Their theories grew more outlandish with each step she took. Maisy realized that in a world where everything was known, predicted, and quantified, her indecision had become a commodity — a rare tidbit of uncertainty for the press to pounce on and devour on a 24-hour loop.

She slipped into her car, the slam of the door muffling their cries. As she drove away, Maisy caught a final glimpse of the frenzy in her rearview mirror. The press broke from the swarm grabbing at anything thye could spin into a headline.

Maisy drove slowly to her polling place, a vintage ATM. As she approached, she saw that the press had beaten her there. A sea of cameras, microphones, and eager reporters lined the path to the ATM, held back by a flimsy police barricade.

They had long done away with paper ballots. They were too easily lost, too easily destroyed. Maisy couldn’t remember the last time they used paper ballots. Was it the election when the trucks carrying ballots were firebombed? Or the one where the poll workers were killed?

The press made her vote sound like it could change the future, and now here she was, about to cast it in an old drive-through ATM at an antiquated bank.

Maisy kept her eyes forward, her knuckles white on the steering wheel. The police struggled to keep the reporters from rushing her car. She inched her car forward, the ATM looming ahead like a monolith.

She liked that she could vote from the privacy of her car. It felt so much safer.

Her phone dinged again with an urgent text message. But she ignored it.

The screen flickered on as she approached the machine. She had two choices: “Money” or “Vote”. Did people still use paper money these days? She pressed the button marked *Vote* on the home screen, acutely aware of the cameras trained on her every move.

She looked into the bio scanner, and after a few seconds, her birth certificate flashed on the screen. It was clearly stamped with her right to vote. A right given to her at birth.

She confirmed her identity and the candidates’ names and headshots flashed onto the screen. Her hands trembled. She hesitated, her finger hovering over the button. *Why does this feel so impossible?*

The press outside, the endless noise of the world, had all funneled into this moment. Maisy felt overwhelmed by the weight of her indecision. The shouts from the reporters seemed to grow louder, more insistent.

What if she chose wrong? What if her vote pushed the country in the wrong direction?

Maisy took a deep breath, her finger hovering over the button. As the world waited, she wondered if her single vote could echo beyond today’s choices. Could it mend a fractured system, or was it merely a whisper against the storm?

With a mix of defiance and hope, she pressed the button. The machine whirred, processing her choice.

She had an aggressive cancer with little chance of survival, so I had to make the difficult decision to put her down. I couldn't bear watching her suffer any longer.

She was my best friend, companion, and my soul cat. Needless to say, I am crushed, devastated, and feel completely lost not having her by my side anymore.

It feels surreal that she's gone. I live alone and my home feels hauntingly empty now. I look over and expect to see her at her favorite spots - resting on my work chair, under the coffee table, or lounging on her cat tree. I cry my eyes out just thinking about her and I yearn to pet her soft fur, rub my cheek on her belly, and give her sweet loving kisses. She was my everything, my entire world, and she was by my side for 15 years. I feel like I can’t move on and just want her back. It's an indescribable pain I can feel deep in my core and my soul wants to scream in agony.

Life has been very rocky, but despite the many hardships I've faced, I could at least count on my best buddy being there for me. She made life worth living, and her presence was a constant reminder that there was still joy to be found. She was my very first cat and was responsible for converting me into a “cat person.”

Funny enough, when I was growing up, my family had a strong hatred towards cats. Our neighborhood had a lot of strays that congregated in our backyard. They chose it as their communal rest room and battlegrounds.  Every night, the sounds of cat fights, screeching, and yowling could be heard outside the window for years until we moved to a new city. As kids, my parents would lecture us on how cats were dirty, evil, and untrustworthy. I'm embarrassed to admit this but I have vivid memories of nasty, unjustified anger towards them. Just their presence would annoy me and whenever I saw them in my backyard, I'd rush to chase them away by sliding open the door, yelling, screaming, cursing, and stomping my feet. I found great pleasure watching them scatter away, jump the fence, and disappear - even though it was temporary, as they would always return to continue their chaotic shenanigans. This distrust and animosity lingered until adulthood.

In 2010, my girlfriend at the time whom I was living with, begged to get a puppy. She knew someone who had a litter of Teacup Yorkies that needed homes and was desperate to adopt one, but I refused. After all, it was my condo so I had the final say. I just wasn't ready to accept the responsibility of being a pet owner. The particular puppy she wanted ended up getting adopted by her ex-roommate, which left her feeling jealous and resentful.

A few months later, she found out that her coworker's mom had rescued a litter of four orange tabby kittens whose mother had died after being hit by a car. She nursed them until they were ready for adoption and sought to find them homes. My girlfriend, who had a cat when she was younger, jumped at the opportunity and begged me to take one in. My initial reaction was a resounding ""HELL NO."" There was just no way I was taking in a cat! But she somehow convinced me that we'd only foster it, which in hindsight was probably dishonest. Since I felt a little guilty about the dog, I reluctantly agreed, on the condition that we would only foster it until one of her other friends would give it a permanent home. So we visited her coworker's home and they had two remaining kittens leftover, both girls. Her co-worker said they were both a little crazy. They told us that the smaller of the two was the instigator of mischief, the troublemaker, and the other was a tad more mellow and sweeter. We chose the latter.

And so, I was raising a cat and I couldn't believe it! I was nervous about it too! I had no idea how to raise one, and it wasn't a very pleasant experience from the start either. Kitty peed on our bed, twice, chewed on computer wires and power cords, and got into things she shouldn't have been. She was pretty unruly, much like the cats from my youth. But as the days and weeks went by, I strangely found myself growing fond of the orange fur ball. Her quirky and unpredictable behavior started to grow on me, and it was just fun playing with a cat. On top of that, she was so cute and I really loved her sweet little kitten meows. I slowly came to realize that all of my preconceived notions about cats were completely wrong. I even started to go out of my way to stop by PetSmart after work to buy her new toys and different types of treats that I thought she would like. I was spoiling her without even realizing it. On one particular day, I came home with another shopping bag filled with the latest toy I bought and my girlfriend's eyes lit up as she exclaimed, ""YOU LOVE HER!"" Me being the ""anti-cat guy,"" I played it off and told her it was her cat, all the while it was a foster fail in the making...

Around a year later, my girlfriend and I decided to part ways. By then, I was fully attached to kitty, who had also grown accustomed to me and my home. I convinced my ex that it would be best for the cat if it remained with me. It also made logical sense because I was clearly chosen as her favorite person. Thankfully, my ex agreed without much resistance.

And so, it was just me and the cat. I think it took maybe two more years for us to truly form an unshakable bond. We developed complete trust in each other, we had a unique language we shared that included childlike catchphrases I would blurt out that would always draw out a reaction, we exchanged knowing glances with meaning and intention, and we had fun playing together. She made me feel like a kid again.

Everything was going well until I was blindsided by a health issue that now makes it impossible for me to pursue romantic relationships or start a family of my own. The realization of this was devastating, and it threw me into a deep depression so profound that I contemplated taking my own life. I felt so alone, but it was my cat who kept me going, forcing me to remain alive to care for her.

One night, I was so overcome with emotion that I spoke to my cat, holding her face with both hands, looking directly into her eyes while my thumbs massaged her cheeks lovingly. I had tears streaming down my face as I told her how much I loved and appreciated her presence in my life. I thanked her for being the one constant that kept me going during my darkest moments, and I made her a promise that I would always be there for her, until her very last breath. I accepted my fate but I was ok with it, because at least I had my cat to love.  

\----------

As I type this on my computer, it still feels like she's in the room with me as she's always been these past 15 years. But I look around and she's nowhere to be found, and it feels so fundamentally wrong. Where are you my love? You were here just a few days ago! And now you're gone... forever?! I can't accept this!!!! My heart aches so badly to be with you again. I would give up everything, all of my worldly possessions and assets ten times over to be with you right now! Please God... let me wake up with my cat purring by my side. Or let me go back to 2010 so that I can relive all those years with her again...

I'll end this by saying thank you to my beautiful soul cat. My best friend. My world. My everything. Thank you for teaching me just how wonderful and magical cats are and how wrong I was when I was young. Thank you for teaching me what unconditional love is. Thank you for being there for me in my darkest moments. Thank you for lifting my spirits every single day we were together. Thank you for all the cuddles, head bonks, and kisses.

I pray that there is an afterlife so that I can be with you again. We'll play our favorite stalker game for as long as you want. We’ll chase each other around the house. I'll throw treats across the room and watch you sprint with joy as you collect them. I’ll give you that crazy ‘look’ and watch you run to the kitchen waiting for your catnip. I'll tap-juggle your favorite squeaky mouse toy with one hand and watch you look on in amazement with your big beautiful eyes and dilated pupils.

One day when I pass, your urn will be buried with me, or our ashes will be joined together.

My sweet little baby, you will forever be in my heart. I will never, ever, forget you, and I will love you until the end of time.

Until we meet again.

Sophia has recently moved in with me and I was very excited about moving to the next step of our relationship. I know that seems early but I thought I was falling in love with her. However, lately, she’s been acting distant and working late more often. When I asked her about it, she said it was because one of her clients could only meet late. I accepted that explanation because, honestly, it made sense.  
  
But the more time went on, the more I noticed she was hiding her phone and pulling away from me. I started to get suspicious and, against my better judgment, I decided to follow her one night. I didn’t want to, but I felt like I needed to know what was going on.  
  
I ended up at a club where I saw her talking to a woman. My imagination ran wild. If she was cheating on me with a woman there's nothing that I can do because I'm a man it would be different if she was cheating on me with a man. I think it's easier to compare that way. It would be a little bit different I might feel different.  
  
I was mortified to find out that the woman was my sister Alexandria (22 Lesbian F), who Sophia had never met before. I was confused  angry and hurt. Why hadn't she talked to me about this. How did she meet my sister. I wanted to confront her but I felt so guilty for following her. so I stormed off home. I was not thinking rationally.  
  
When Sophia came back about 3 hours later, I thought I had calmed down enough so I confronted her.   
  
She explained that she had met this women on Bumble and they had gone out for coffee, which apparently progressed into something more. She said she had only kissed a girl once before, and that kiss ""awakened"" something in her. She said she had the urge to explore these feelings. She insisted that she had been suppressing her feelings for long that they forced there way out.  She said there was no possible way that she knew the woman was my sister. She told me that was sick and disgusting. She then went on to say that she was scared about her feelings. She vehemently denied knowing it was my sister She said she didn't know what to think about these feelings if they were real if they weren't. She even said that she felt ashamed of them. . I was at a loss for words.  
  
I was furious and so hurt. While holding back tears. I told her to leave our apartment and find somewhere else to stay for the time being. I told her that she would have to stay at a hotel or something. I just couldn't look at her; I felt betrayed and confused about everything. I told her ask she was walking out the door. she might have destroyed our relationship and messed up my family dynamics forever.  
  
Now I’m wondering if I overreacted. I talked to my family about this a they are saying that I am the AH for kicking her in the streets. I’m still dealing with so many emotions—anger, confusion, and heartbreak. AITA for asking her to leave? Should I have handled it differently? What do I do now?",7,1729651119.0,AITAH,22,0.77,False

For example: 

• never pays me for her Coffee/Food order when I pickup for the team

• never asks if I want a Coffee/Food if she goes (only gets for herself)

• wanted me to do her schoolwork/papers for online college 

• befriended me, called me all of the time, complimented, when I agreed to help her with schoolwork/papers 

• stopped calling me when I said I can’t help her with college work because I have my own stress, and suggested her to pay somebody 

Despite, I want to be amicable, so I brought a small cake, cute, under $15, to work for her birthday. 

Her birthday passes, she did not have the cake, she says she is leaving it in the work refrigerator for the next day.

Next day passes, she leaves it in there again. 

She knows it is there because she gets her food out of the refrigerator. 

So at the end of the second day, I took the cake home because it is going to expire, and discarded it. 

My gut instinct says she is insulting me by not accepting the gift because it is a small cake, and she expected me to bring a large, lavish cake. 

I also bought her a few sunflowers for the birthday. She took that home. 

I realize I was trying to people please and earn a work friend, and it’s one-sided. I also learned not to be nice at work because some people take it for granted. 

Today, when I was going to work, I was very close to text message if she wanted Coffee. But I didn’t because I felt in my gut that she never asks me if I want anything.

I walk into work, and there she is with her Coffee. Which confirmed exactly how I felt- she uses me.

AITAH for taking the cake home and throwing it out since it sat there untouched for two days?

1ga01cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1ga01cd/sixteen_tons/,Sixteen Tons,"“What’s got you in such a sour mood, Brandon? It’s payday!” my veteran colleague Vinson asked as the rusty freight elevator noisily rattled its way up towards the penthouse suite.

For the past year or two – I’m honestly not sure how long it’s been, actually – I’ve been under contract for an otherworldly masked Lord who calls himself Ignazio di Incognauta. He’s not a demon, exactly. He’s closer to Fae, I think, but I don’t fully understand what he is. I never sought him out. He came to me. I asked him how he even knew who I was, and he slapped me across the face for my insolence.

I still signed up though. That’s how desperate I was. He doesn’t waste his time offering deals to people who can say no.

He sends me and the rest of my crew out on what I can best describe as odd jobs. Half the time – hell, most of the time – I’m not even sure exactly what it is we’re doing. Most of the crew have been around longer than I have, and some of them aren’t human, but they all seem to have a better idea of what’s going on than me.

Our foreman Vothstag is technically the one in charge, but he’s not all there in the head; the top of his cranium’s been removed and a good chunk of his brain’s been scooped out. He mostly just barks guttural nonsense that none of us really understand, but somehow compels us to do what we’re supposed to, even when we don’t know what that is. He’s a hulking hunchback with an overgrown beard who usually wears an elk skull to cover up the hole in his head. If he was ever human, I don’t think he is now.

Vinson is our *de facto* leader, however, since he’s more or less a normal guy that we can relate to. Aside from Vothstag, he’s been working for Ignazio the longest. I won’t bother describing what he looks like, since the rest of us wear gas masks on duty. They’re partially to protect us from environmental and workplace hazards, partially to conceal our identities, but mainly to bring us more easily under Ignazio’s control.

That was why were all wearing our masks on the elevator, incidentally. We were on our way to see the big boss, and our contracts made it very clear we were never to remove our masks in his presence.  

“Come on, Vinson. You know meetings with Iggy never go well,” I replied bluntly.

“Oh, it’s just bluster. You know that. He’s got to put the fear of God into us,” Vinson claimed. “If he wasn’t actually satisfied with our performance, we wouldn’t still be here.”

“No, Brandon’s right. Iggy wouldn’t have called all ten of us in just to hand us our scrip and call us lazy arses,” Loewald chimed in.

“There’s nine of us, now,” Klaus reminded him grimly.

“Right, sorry. Hard to keep track some days,” Loewald admitted. “Regardless; something’s up, and the odds are pretty slim it will be something we like.”

I cringed as Vothstag shouted some of his garbled nonsense back towards Loewald.

“Yes, I know we’re not being paid to have fun, but –”

“We’re not being paid at all!” Klaus interrupted. “None of us are getting any real money until our contracts are up, and have any of you actually known anyone who made it to the end of their contract?” 

He recoiled as Vothstag spun around and began roaring at him, hot spittle flying out from beneath his mask of carved bone as he furiously waved his fist in his face.

“He’s right, Klaus. You’re being paranoid,” Vinson said in an eerily calm tone. “I’ve served out multiple contracts, and I’ve got the silver to prove it.”

He confidently reached into his pocket and held a troy-ounce coin of Seelie Silver between his fingers. Fish and Chips, the pair of three-foot-tall… *somethings* that work for us immediately crowded around him and began eyeing it greedily.

“That’s right boys, take a gander. That’s powerful magic right there, and you’ll get one of these for every moon you’ve worked at the end of your contracts,” he reminded us before quickly pocketing the coin away again. “Unless, of course, you do something to get your contract prematurely terminated; then you’ll have nothing to show for it but a fistful of expired scrip! So keep your heads down, mouths shut, and your eyes on the prize. You’ll have pockets jangling full of coins soon enough.”

As discreetly as I could, I slipped my hands into my pockets and rubbed my one Seelie coin for good luck. None of them knew I had it, because I didn’t want to explain how I got it, but that little bit of fortune it brought me had almost been enough to let me escape [once](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/comments/yzlz7s/dont_shop_at_the_isomart_after_dark/).

If I could just muster up the skill to make the best use of my luck, it would be enough to get me out for good one day.

The freight elevator finally came to a stop, and the doors creaked open to reveal the spacious and sumptuous penthouse of our employer. Portraits, animal heads, shields, weapons, and most of all masquerade masks covered nearly every square inch of the walls. Amidst the suits of armour and porcelain vases, there were dozens of priceless ornaments strewn throughout the room. They were incredibly tempting to steal, which was their whole point. Stealing from the boss was a violation of your contract, and you did not want to break your contract.  

The wide windows on the far wall offered a panoramic view of our decaying company town, nestled in a valley between sharp crimson mountains beneath a xanthous sky twinkling with a thousand black stars. You may have heard of such a place before, it has many names, but I will speak none of them here. 

Ignazio was sitting on a reclining couch in front of the fireplace, some paperwork left out on the coffee table and a featureless mask like a silver spiderweb clutched in his hand. Ignazio himself always wore the top half of a golden Oni mask, which in and of itself wasn’t unusual for our company, but the odd thing was that several portraits in the penthouse showed that it had once been a full mask.

I’ve always wondered what happened to the bottom half.  

Aside from that, Ignazio wasn’t too unusual looking. He was tall, skinny, and swarthy with a pronounced chin, tousled dark brown hair and always dressed in doublets of silk and velvet like he was performing Shakespeare or something.

Vothstag went into the room first, with Vinson almost, but not quite, at his side. Fish and Chips scamped after them, followed by Loewald, Klaus, and myself.

The last two members of our crew are called Hamm and Gristle, and they’re the two I know the least about. They keep to themselves, and I don’t think I’ve ever even seen them with their masks off. I have seen them without gloves on though, and both of their hands are white with pink-tinged fingers. I have no idea what that means, but for some reason, I always found it oddly unsettling.

The only thing I know for sure about them is that they’re the only survivors of another crew that tried to run out on their contract, and I know better than to ask for details about that.

“Gentlemen, Gentlemen, right on time,” Ignazio greeted us as he waved us over. He positioned himself on his couch to make it impossible for any of us to sit beside him, and none of us dared to take a seat at any of the clawfooted armchairs that were meant for guests with much higher stations in life. “I’ve got this moon’s scrip books all stamped and approved. You’ll notice they’re a bit light, seeing as how you were slightly behind quota on this assignment.”

None of us objected, and none of us were particularly surprised. I was grateful that the mask hid my expression, and I’m sure I wasn’t the only one. I still had to make an effort to mind my body language though. Being so accustomed to his employees and compatriots wearing masks, Ignazio was quite astute to body language.

Vinson accepted the stack of nine booklets and nodded gratefully.

“We appreciate your leniency, my lord, and look forward to earning back our privileges on our next assignment,” he said.

“I was hoping you’d say that,” Ignazio grinned as he took a sip from his crystal chalice. He set it down on the coffee table and picked up a dossier. “Halloween is fast approaching, and that means we need costumes and candy. Costumes we have in abundance, obviously, but candy’s one vice I don’t usually keep well stocked.”

“So we’re actually stealing candy from babies on our next job?” Klaus asked.

“Nothing so quotidian,” Ignazio sneered. “Remind me; have any of you met Icky before?”

The name meant nothing to me, but I glanced from side to side to see if anyone else reacted to it. I could have sworn I saw Hamm and Gristle perk their heads up slightly.

“She’s that Clown woman, right? The one in charge of that god-awful circus?” Vinson asked.

“I beg your pardon? It’s an enchanted Circus that travels the worlds and offers sanctuary to paranormal vagabonds in need,” Ignazio claimed half-heartedly. “And I might be able to pawn a few of you off on them if it comes to that, so be careful you don’t fall any further behind on your quotas. But you’re right; she is a Clown, with a capital C, and Clowns love candy. She’ll be attending my All Hallows’ Ball this year, and I don’t want her to feel excluded, so we’ll need some real top-shelf candy on offer.”

“Ah… we’re still waiting for the other shoe to drop here, boss,” Vinson confessed as most of us shared nervous glances with one another. “You want us to get candy? Fancy candy? I… I don’t get it. What’s the catch?”   

“Oh god, we’re not taking it from babies: we’re serving the babies with it!” Loewald balked in horror.

“No, but thank you for that highball to make the actual assignment seem more reasonable,” Ignazio said. “No, I’m sending you all down to the Taproots of the World Tree to collect some of the crystalized sap there.”

“The… The Taproots of the World Tree?” Vinson repeated softly. “The physical manifestation of the metaphysical network that binds all the worlds and planes of Creation, gnawed at by the Naught Things trying to break their way into reality? You’re sending us down there… for sweets?”

“Icky swears that Yggdrasil syrup pairs beautifully with French Toast,” he replied blithely. “This is an especially dangerous assignment, so I want you all to read that dossier in full. Emrys has been charting and forging new pathways through the planes from his spire in Adderwood, so thanks to him your trip down at least will be relatively easy.”

“Just… just there and back, right?” Vinson asked desperately, his voice wavering. “Just a handful of the stuff to wow Icky, and we’re done, right?”

A sadistic smirk slowly spread across Ignazio’s face before he told us how much crystalized sap we would need to retrieve.

\*\*\*

“You mine sixteen tons, what do you get? Another day older, and deeper in debt,” Loebald sang as he chipped away at the pulsing amber crystal emerging from the leviathan root.

The World Tree was cosmically colossal, though it’s meaningless to describe its size since I can only describe the parts of it that exist in three dimensions. The twin trunks of the tree snaked around each other like a double helix, each alight with an ever-shifting astral aura that perpetually waxed and waned in synchronicity with its twin. From its crown sprung a seemingly infinite mass of fractally dividing branches, shimmering with countless spherical ‘leaves’ which I knew to be individual universes. The base of the tree spawned an equally infinite mass of sprawling taproots, anchoring it in place and drawing precious sustenance from the edges of reality.  

As dangerous as it was to be there, it was nonetheless a sublime experience. You think that looking upon all of existence like that would fill you with Lovecraftian madness at your own insignificance, but it was far more transcendental than that. On some fundamental level, I recognized that tree. It was Yggdrasil. It was the Biblical tree of Good and Evil. It was the Two Trees of Valinor. That tree was meant to be there, and so was everything inside of it. Sure, it was functionally infinite and everything in it was finite, but the tree wasn’t merely massive; it was intricate. In the grand scheme of things, nothing inside of it was superfluous. Everything, no matter its scale, was part of the ultimate design of the tree. You and I may not be any more important than anyone or anything else, but if we weren’t important, we wouldn’t be here.

I’m not entirely sure if any of my coworkers felt the same way though.

“Saint Peter don’t you call me, ’cause I can’t go,” Loebald continued to sing, only to be interrupted by Vothstag’s irate howling, his eyes burning like coals as he dared him to finish the chorus.

Loebald bowed his head contritely as he awkwardly cleared his throat. When Vothstag was satisfied he had been cowed into silence, he turned around to resume his work.

“’Cause I owe my soul to the company store,” I finished for him, not too loudly, but loud enough that everyone heard me.

Vothstag immediately came charging at me, roaring in fury, but I didn’t flinch. I just let him chew me out for about a minute until I heard something that I was pretty sure was a question.

“That’s ridiculous. You’re making more noise than either of us,” I countered. “And wasting more time. Now if you don’t mind, I’ve got work to do.”

Vothstag sneered at me, but since I had resumed my task, his job as taskmaster was complete, and he left to attend to other matters.

“What the hell are you doing, pushing your luck like that, Brandon?” Vinson whispered.

“He was out of line. Even chain gangs are allowed to sing,” I explained. “Besides, I’m right, aren’t I? If we attract any unwanted attention, it will be because of him.”

“This isn’t the place to cause trouble!” he hissed. “Fill the carts as fast as you can so we can get out of here!”

When we arrived at the Taproots, we saw that we weren’t the first beings to try to mine this deposit of sap. Someone, likely some clan of Unseelie Fae, had established a fairly complex operation with rails and hand carts. As convenient as this was for us, it did of course pose the uncomfortable question of why the site had been completely abandoned when it was obviously far from depleted.

Me, Vinson, Loebald, and Klaus were chipping away at the crystal sap, tossing what we could into a nearby trolley cart. When it was full, Hamm and Gristle would haul it off so that Fish and Chips could scoop it into twenty-kilogram bags, which Hamm and Gristle would then stack and secure onto skids.

And as always, Vothstag supervised.

“Sixteen bleedin’ tons of this bilge,” Vinson muttered as he took a swing at it with his pickaxe. “And he’s got the nerve to tell us it’s just an appetizer for a party guest. What do you suppose they’re going to do with it all.”

“Refine it into proper syrup, I imagine,” Loewald replied. “Make it into sweets and sodas, or just drizzle some of it straight onto flapjacks. Either way, they’ll make a killing. Sixteen tons will probably sell for millions.”

“Why though? Is it just exotic sugar?” I asked.

“What do you think?” Loewald asked rhetorically, gesturing at the source. “For reality benders, anything from the edges of reality is potent stuff. They put a lump of this in their morning coffee, and the Veil will seem as weak to them as it is here. There’s no telling what havoc they’ll get up to, so you better hope we’re not around to see.”

“Now you’re just being ridiculous. Clowns don’t drink coffee,” Vinson joked.

I was about to ask him how he would know, when Vothstag put his hand on my shoulder and spun me around. Hamm and Gristle had returned with the empty cart, but only Gristle was getting ready to pull the full one. Vothstag spewed some of his usual gibberish, gesturing at me and then towards Hamm’s empty space at the cart.

“Because I sang one line? Seriously?” I asked. I was about to throw Loewald under the bus for singing in the first place, but Vothstag was already roaring incomprehensibly. “Alright, alright. I’ll pull the damn cart.”

I handed my pickaxe over to Hamm, who instantly began swinging at the sap with manic enthusiasm. Gristle gave me a slight nod of condolence before Vothstag yoked me up to the cart like an ox and then sent us on our way with an angry shout.

“If you don’t mind me asking, how come Hamm deserves a break and you don’t?” I asked Gristle as we made our way down the track, the dinging of our colleague’s pickaxes slowly fading into the background.

Gristle looked over his shoulder to confirm the Vothstag was well out of earshot, and then turned his head towards mine.

“Vinson’s wrong, you know,” he said in a soft, conspiratorial whisper.

“Ah… I’m story?” I asked.

“About Clowns and coffee,” he clarified. “Icky drinks coffee. I’ve seen her do it. She takes it with double cream and sugar to keep it Clown Kosher, of course. She’s a little too classy to indulge in stereotypical candy binges, but she’s still got a sweet tooth like the rest of us.”

“…Us?” I asked uneasily.

Gristle nodded, lifting up his gas mask by the filter and revealing his face to me for the first time. His poreless skin was a lustrous white, but his lips, nose, and the space around his eyes were all pitch black, and the eyes themselves sparkled with the light of a thousand dying stars. His mouth was spread into an unnaturally wide smile, revealing that his teeth were not only perfect but shiny to the point that I could see myself in them.

And I looked terrified.

“Loewald was right though, about what this stuff will do to us,” he went on. “Once everything’s fully loaded, Hamm and I are going to take a mouthful each and then take the whole haul for ourselves. We’ll stash some of it away somewhere safe, then use the rest to buy our way back into the Circus. The only problem is getting there. That’s where you come in.”

“What are you on about? How can I possibly help you get back to your Circus?” I asked.

“With that Seelie coin you got in your pocket,” he said, lowering his voice so that I only barely heard him. “These carts weren’t meant to be powered manually, you know. They run on Faerie magic, and that coin’s got enough that we can drive all sixteen tons of our loot to anywhere in the worlds we want.”

I briefly considered denying that I even had the coin, but if he was determined, he could find and take it easily enough, so there really wasn’t any point.

“Ignoring for the moment how you even know I have that, why not ask Vinson?” I suggested. “He’s got way more Seelie Silver than I do.”

“He doesn’t want out. You do,” Gristle responded. “You tried to escape once, and I know you’re just itching for a chance to try again.”

“But… Ignazio knows what you are, doesn’t he? He wouldn’t have let you around the sap if he wasn’t prepared for you to try to take some,” I said.

“He doesn’t know Hamm and I can take our masks off without his say-so,” Gristle explained. “We’ve been living off meagre rations of powdered milk to keep us in line, but we were able to get a hold of a bottle of the fresh stuff and chugged it before we came here. Ignazio and Vothstag have no power over us right now.”

“… I’m sorry, milk?” I asked confused.

“Not important at the moment. Are you in or not?” he asked.

I considered his proposition for a moment, deciding on one final question before answering.    

“Why not just take the coin from me?”

“Because I’m a nice guy,” he said with a sickeningly wide grin. “And… stealing Seelie Silver tends not to end well. I don’t need an answer now. The load’s not full yet. Think about it, and when the time comes, do whatever you’ve got to do.”

He pulled his mask back down, and we finished hauling the cart over to Fish and Chips in silence.

He wasn’t wrong about me wanting to escape, but my plan had always been to quietly sneak off and be long gone before anyone noticed. A fight between Vothstag and a pair of superpowered Clowns followed by a daring getaway on an Unseelie mining cart was a bit riskier than anything I had envisioned. But at the same time, this was an unprecedented opportunity that would likely never come again.  From the Taproots of the World Tree, I could go literally anywhere, and never have to worry about Ignazio or his minions tracking me down.

All it would cost me was the single coin I had to my name.

I hauled the cart with Gristle for the rest of the shift. Eventually, we had a train of sixteen pallets, each loaded with fifty twenty-kilogram sacks of crystalized sap.

“That’s it then. Order’s full,” Vinson declared as he walked the length of the train, testing the chains to make sure the cargo was fully secured. “All of you hop in the front and let’s get the hell out of here.”

Vothstag roared in disagreement, standing between us and the cart and making a vaguely groping gesture.

“Right, right. Contraband check,” Vinson nodded with a weary sigh as he outstretched his arms. “Nothing too invasive now, you hear? If this stuff was inside of us, you’d already know it.”

Vothstag didn’t acknowledge his comment, but proceeded to pat him down and empty his pockets.

Hamm and Gristle each gave me a knowing look. If I did nothing, Vothstag would find my coin and it would all be over for me anyway. I nodded my assent, and braced myself for the worse.

With a single swift motion, Hamm and Gristle each pulled their masks off, and the visages of the two monstrous Clowns were enough to throw all of us into immediate pandemonium. Hamm’s hair, eyes, lips and nose were all a fiery red, and I saw now that the tips of their ears had a pink tinge, just like their fingers. The instant their masks were off, they wasted no time shovelling a handful of crystal sap into their mouths.

Vothstag howled and charged straight at them, and everyone else scattered as quickly as they could to avoid being bulldozed by the massive deer man. Hamm and Gristle stood their ground, each of them grabbing ahold of one of his antlers. Despite his size and speed, Vothstag was brought to a dead stop.

He snorted and bellowed as he tried to force himself forward, but he was completely unable to overpower the two Clowns. Hamm and Gristle exchanged sinister smiles and began to spin Vothstag around and around. Within seconds his feet were off the ground, and with each rotation, he gained more and more momentum until his attackers finally let go of his antlers and sent him flying into the distance.

“The rest of you, stay out of our way!” Gristle shouted as he marched towards the front cart, grabbing me by the scruff of my jacket and pulling me along with him.

“Wait, why? Why can’t they come? Why can’t we all go?” I protested.

“We don’t know what half these freaks are and we don’t trust them,” he said as he tossed me onto the cart. “Now drive. Go straight until I say otherwise.”

I looked out at my confused and frightened companions, and took a bit of solace in the fact that they weren’t entirely certain if I had betrayed them or if I was just being kidnapped. I hesitated for a moment, but Hamm’s sharp talons digging into my shoulder were enough to press me into action.

With my coin of Seelie Silver clutched in my right palm, I grabbed a firm hold of the driving shaft and pushed the train forward. It accelerated at a remarkable pace, and before I knew it, we were speeding away from our work site and towards freedom.

“It’s working. It’s actually working,” Gristle laughed in relief.

“Even Vothstag can’t run this fast!” Hamm declared triumphantly. “The whole haul is ours! We’re rich! We’re free!”

I wanted to celebrate with them. I really did. But deep down inside I knew we weren’t out of the woods yet.

“You guys read that dossier Iggy gave us, right?” I asked. “The Naught Things that gnaw the Taproots are attracted to ontological anchors – anything that’s more real than its surroundings. If you guys are reality benders, and you just ate a massive power-up, doesn’t that make you the realest things here?”

“Isn’t that cute? He thinks he knows more about ontodynamics than us because he read a dossier,” Hamm scoffed.

“This isn’t our first time on the fringes of the unreal, boy!” Gristle replied. “You just drive this train, and let us worry about –”

Without warning, the Taproot split open ahead of us into a fuming, festering chasm. The ground quake was enough to completely derail the train, and I ducked and rolled while I had the chance.

When I came out of the roll, I looked up to see a titanic, disfigured, and disembodied head rising out of the chasm. The size and proportions of the entity fluctuated wildly, as if I was only looking at the three-dimensional facets of it like the World Tree itself. It was encrusted with some kind of dark barnacles, and anything that wasn’t its face was covered in thousands of squirming and feathery tentacles of every conceivable length. It had no nose, but several mouths which chanted backwards-sounding words in synchronicity with each other, dropping rotting black teeth every time they opened and closed. 

There were six randomly spaced and variously sized eyeballs darting around independently of each other, each glowing with a sickly yellow light. I was paralyzed in fear, terrified that the Naught Thing would see me, but all six of its eyes soon locked onto Hamm and Gristle.

As it slowly ascended upwards like a hot air balloon, a pair of flickering tongues shot out of two of its mouths with predatory intent. The Clowns were scooped up like flies, screaming as they were whisked back into the Naught Thing’s cavernous maws. I don’t know much about Clowns or what they’re capable of, only that Hamm and Gristle never got a chance to test their mettle against this behemoth. A few chomps of its black teeth, and it was all over.

I sat there in silence, watching as the Naught Thing continued to drift away, never daring to assume that it had forgotten about me.

“Brandon!” I heard a voice call from the distance.

I was finally able to pull my eyes off the Naught Thing, and when I looked down the track, I saw the rest of my crew hurrying towards me.

Which included a very angry Vothstag.

Grabbing me by the jacket and lifting me off the ground, he roared furiously in my face, demanding answers.

“Easy, Vothstag, easy!” Vinson insisted. “They just grabbed the kid. It wasn’t his idea.”

Vothstag growled skeptically, eyeing the toppled train beside us. He knew it could have only been driven like that by Seelie magic, and I still had my lucky coin clutched tightly in my right hand.

“…Hamm must have picked my pocket when he was working alongside us,” Vinson suggested.

I knew he didn’t really think that. He knew exactly how many coins he had, and he knew he wasn’t missing any. I don’t know why he covered for me, but I owe him big.

“Serves him right, too. Bloody idiot,” he said with a sad shake of his head as he surveyed the wreckage. “Let this be a lesson for all of you if you ever think about stealing my Seelie Silver! That’s right, Fish and Chips, I’m looking at you!”

Vothstag howled again, clearly unconvinced.

“They took me as a driver so that they could stay focused on defending the train!” I claimed. “If I hadn’t jumped when I did, they may have stood a chance against that giant floating head! I saved our haul!”

Vothstag snorted in contempt, but set me back on my feet. I don’t think he believed me, really, but he knew that Ignazio wouldn’t hold him blameless in this little debacle either, so it was in all of our best interests not to cast aspersions on one another’s stories.

“Listen up, everybody! We’re two men down and we’ve got to get this rig back on the track before some other unspeakable abomination comes along, so get moving!” Vinson ordered.

For once, Vothstag was doing most of the work, using his might to set the carts back on the tracks, while the rest of us just picked up any sacks of sap that had come loose.

“What a bloody joke,” Loewald grumbled as he threw a sack onto a cart. “Down from nine to seven, any of us could still die at any minute, and for what? We mined sixteen tons, and what do we get?”

“Another day older,” I agreed, throwing another sack next to his. “But some days, that’s enough.”",1,1729650906.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

1g9zzpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1g9zzpp/struggling_with_sleep/,Struggling with sleep,"I don't know if this is an ADHD thing or not but I am really struggling to sleep at the moment and it really beginning to affect me mentally and physically.

I've tried to contact the GP but it isn't considered an emergency so I have to wait 2 weeks for a phone call appointment. 

For the last 5 weeks my sleep has been wildly inconsistent which is not very common to me. Normally I have a good routine where I go to sleep at 10pm, sleep solidly until 5:30am when I wake up.
But at the moment I am struggling to sleep even when I'm tired, my mind seems to just be racing and half the time I couldn't even tell you what I'm thinking about it's just lots of random things. When I do then full asleep it hasn't been a deep sleep, I'm waking up regularly throughout the night and never feel like I'm asleep fully, more like half asleep and partially aware that I'm not asleep the whole time.
I'm also consistently waking up way earlier than needed, around 2am most mornings and being wide awake and unable to sleep. 

Sleeping never used to be an issue for me and I used to love going to bed and suddenly now I can't sleep at all and the thought stresses me out. I feel restless in bed, constantly moving around, my legs feel achey and restless and nothing feels comfortable.

I do all the generic advice, I walk a lot daily (around 17k steps a day), I don't smoke, drink alcohol or coffee, apart from the odd day my diet is consistent and healthy, I always have same bed time and wake up time, my room is pitch black, I use a sound machine for white noise as it helps me (have tried without recently too).

My job (teaching) I know can be stereotypically stressful, but this year I've got great classes and no real problems at all. I'm not overworked and never really stress about that. The lack of sleep however is making it very difficult to effectively do my job.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I really don't know what else I can do at this point.",1,1729650758.0,ADHD,3,1.0,False

1g9zwjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1g9zwjp/sixteen_tons/,Sixteen Tons,"“What’s got you in such a sour mood, Brandon? It’s payday!” my veteran colleague Vinson asked as the rusty freight elevator noisily rattled its way up towards the penthouse suite.

For the past year or two – I’m honestly not sure how long it’s been, actually – I’ve been under contract for an otherworldly masked Lord who calls himself Ignazio di Incognauta. He’s not a demon, exactly. He’s closer to Fae, I think, but I don’t fully understand what he is. I never sought him out. He came to me. I asked him how he even knew who I was, and he slapped me across the face for my insolence.

I still signed up though. That’s how desperate I was. He doesn’t waste his time offering deals to people who can say no.

He sends me and the rest of my crew out on what I can best describe as odd jobs. Half the time – hell, most of the time – I’m not even sure exactly what it is we’re doing. Most of the crew have been around longer than I have, and some of them aren’t human, but they all seem to have a better idea of what’s going on than me.

Our foreman Vothstag is technically the one in charge, but he’s not all there in the head; the top of his cranium’s been removed and a good chunk of his brain’s been scooped out. He mostly just barks guttural nonsense that none of us really understand, but somehow compels us to do what we’re supposed to, even when we don’t know what that is. He’s a hulking hunchback with an overgrown beard who usually wears an elk skull to cover up the hole in his head. If he was ever human, I don’t think he is now.

Vinson is our *de facto* leader, however, since he’s more or less a normal guy that we can relate to. Aside from Vothstag, he’s been working for Ignazio the longest. I won’t bother describing what he looks like, since the rest of us wear gas masks on duty. They’re partially to protect us from environmental and workplace hazards, partially to conceal our identities, but mainly to bring us more easily under Ignazio’s control.

That was why were all wearing our masks on the elevator, incidentally. We were on our way to see the big boss, and our contracts made it very clear we were never to remove our masks in his presence.  

“Come on, Vinson. You know meetings with Iggy never go well,” I replied bluntly.

“Oh, it’s just bluster. You know that. He’s got to put the fear of God into us,” Vinson claimed. “If he wasn’t actually satisfied with our performance, we wouldn’t still be here.”

“No, Brandon’s right. Iggy wouldn’t have called all ten of us in just to hand us our scrip and call us lazy arses,” Loewald chimed in.

“There’s nine of us, now,” Klaus reminded him grimly.

“Right, sorry. Hard to keep track some days,” Loewald admitted. “Regardless; something’s up, and the odds are pretty slim it will be something we like.”

I cringed as Vothstag shouted some of his garbled nonsense back towards Loewald.

“Yes, I know we’re not being paid to have fun, but –”

“We’re not being paid at all!” Klaus interrupted. “None of us are getting any real money until our contracts are up, and have any of you actually known anyone who made it to the end of their contract?” 

He recoiled as Vothstag spun around and began roaring at him, hot spittle flying out from beneath his mask of carved bone as he furiously waved his fist in his face.

“He’s right, Klaus. You’re being paranoid,” Vinson said in an eerily calm tone. “I’ve served out multiple contracts, and I’ve got the silver to prove it.”

He confidently reached into his pocket and held a troy-ounce coin of Seelie Silver between his fingers. Fish and Chips, the pair of three-foot-tall… *somethings* that work for us immediately crowded around him and began eyeing it greedily.

“That’s right boys, take a gander. That’s powerful magic right there, and you’ll get one of these for every moon you’ve worked at the end of your contracts,” he reminded us before quickly pocketing the coin away again. “Unless, of course, you do something to get your contract prematurely terminated; then you’ll have nothing to show for it but a fistful of expired scrip! So keep your heads down, mouths shut, and your eyes on the prize. You’ll have pockets jangling full of coins soon enough.”

As discreetly as I could, I slipped my hands into my pockets and rubbed my one Seelie coin for good luck. None of them knew I had it, because I didn’t want to explain how I got it, but that little bit of fortune it brought me had almost been enough to let me escape [once](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/comments/yzlz7s/dont_shop_at_the_isomart_after_dark/).

If I could just muster up the skill to make the best use of my luck, it would be enough to get me out for good one day.

The freight elevator finally came to a stop, and the doors creaked open to reveal the spacious and sumptuous penthouse of our employer. Portraits, animal heads, shields, weapons, and most of all masquerade masks covered nearly every square inch of the walls. Amidst the suits of armour and porcelain vases, there were dozens of priceless ornaments strewn throughout the room. They were incredibly tempting to steal, which was their whole point. Stealing from the boss was a violation of your contract, and you did not want to break your contract.  

The wide windows on the far wall offered a panoramic view of our decaying company town, nestled in a valley between sharp crimson mountains beneath a xanthous sky twinkling with a thousand black stars. You may have heard of such a place before, it has many names, but I will speak none of them here. 

Ignazio was sitting on a reclining couch in front of the fireplace, some paperwork left out on the coffee table and a featureless mask like a silver spiderweb clutched in his hand. Ignazio himself always wore the top half of a golden Oni mask, which in and of itself wasn’t unusual for our company, but the odd thing was that several portraits in the penthouse showed that it had once been a full mask.

I’ve always wondered what happened to the bottom half.  

Aside from that, Ignazio wasn’t too unusual looking. He was tall, skinny, and swarthy with a pronounced chin, tousled dark brown hair and always dressed in doublets of silk and velvet like he was performing Shakespeare or something.

Vothstag went into the room first, with Vinson almost, but not quite, at his side. Fish and Chips scamped after them, followed by Loewald, Klaus, and myself.

The last two members of our crew are called Hamm and Gristle, and they’re the two I know the least about. They keep to themselves, and I don’t think I’ve ever even seen them with their masks off. I have seen them without gloves on though, and both of their hands are white with pink-tinged fingers. I have no idea what that means, but for some reason, I always found it oddly unsettling.

The only thing I know for sure about them is that they’re the only survivors of another crew that tried to run out on their contract, and I know better than to ask for details about that.

“Gentlemen, Gentlemen, right on time,” Ignazio greeted us as he waved us over. He positioned himself on his couch to make it impossible for any of us to sit beside him, and none of us dared to take a seat at any of the clawfooted armchairs that were meant for guests with much higher stations in life. “I’ve got this moon’s scrip books all stamped and approved. You’ll notice they’re a bit light, seeing as how you were slightly behind quota on this assignment.”

None of us objected, and none of us were particularly surprised. I was grateful that the mask hid my expression, and I’m sure I wasn’t the only one. I still had to make an effort to mind my body language though. Being so accustomed to his employees and compatriots wearing masks, Ignazio was quite astute to body language.

Vinson accepted the stack of nine booklets and nodded gratefully.

“We appreciate your leniency, my lord, and look forward to earning back our privileges on our next assignment,” he said.

“I was hoping you’d say that,” Ignazio grinned as he took a sip from his crystal chalice. He set it down on the coffee table and picked up a dossier. “Halloween is fast approaching, and that means we need costumes and candy. Costumes we have in abundance, obviously, but candy’s one vice I don’t usually keep well stocked.”

“So we’re actually stealing candy from babies on our next job?” Klaus asked.

“Nothing so quotidian,” Ignazio sneered. “Remind me; have any of you met Icky before?”

The name meant nothing to me, but I glanced from side to side to see if anyone else reacted to it. I could have sworn I saw Hamm and Gristle perk their heads up slightly.

“She’s that Clown woman, right? The one in charge of that god-awful circus?” Vinson asked.

“I beg your pardon? It’s an enchanted Circus that travels the worlds and offers sanctuary to paranormal vagabonds in need,” Ignazio claimed half-heartedly. “And I might be able to pawn a few of you off on them if it comes to that, so be careful you don’t fall any further behind on your quotas. But you’re right; she is a Clown, with a capital C, and Clowns love candy. She’ll be attending my All Hallows’ Ball this year, and I don’t want her to feel excluded, so we’ll need some real top-shelf candy on offer.”

“Ah… we’re still waiting for the other shoe to drop here, boss,” Vinson confessed as most of us shared nervous glances with one another. “You want us to get candy? Fancy candy? I… I don’t get it. What’s the catch?”   

“Oh god, we’re not taking it from babies: we’re serving the babies with it!” Loewald balked in horror.

“No, but thank you for that highball to make the actual assignment seem more reasonable,” Ignazio said. “No, I’m sending you all down to the Taproots of the World Tree to collect some of the crystalized sap there.”

“The… The Taproots of the World Tree?” Vinson repeated softly. “The physical manifestation of the metaphysical network that binds all the worlds and planes of Creation, gnawed at by the Naught Things trying to break their way into reality? You’re sending us down there… for sweets?”

“Icky swears that Yggdrasil syrup pairs beautifully with French Toast,” he replied blithely. “This is an especially dangerous assignment, so I want you all to read that dossier in full. Emrys has been charting and forging new pathways through the planes from his spire in Adderwood, so thanks to him your trip down at least will be relatively easy.”

“Just… just there and back, right?” Vinson asked desperately, his voice wavering. “Just a handful of the stuff to wow Icky, and we’re done, right?”

A sadistic smirk slowly spread across Ignazio’s face before he told us how much crystalized sap we would need to retrieve.

\*\*\*

“You mine sixteen tons, what do you get? Another day older, and deeper in debt,” Loebald sang as he chipped away at the pulsing amber crystal emerging from the leviathan root.

The World Tree was cosmically colossal, though it’s meaningless to describe its size since I can only describe the parts of it that exist in three dimensions. The twin trunks of the tree snaked around each other like a double helix, each alight with an ever-shifting astral aura that perpetually waxed and waned in synchronicity with its twin. From its crown sprung a seemingly infinite mass of fractally dividing branches, shimmering with countless spherical ‘leaves’ which I knew to be individual universes. The base of the tree spawned an equally infinite mass of sprawling taproots, anchoring it in place and drawing precious sustenance from the edges of reality.  

As dangerous as it was to be there, it was nonetheless a sublime experience. You think that looking upon all of existence like that would fill you with Lovecraftian madness at your own insignificance, but it was far more transcendental than that. On some fundamental level, I recognized that tree. It was Yggdrasil. It was the Biblical tree of Good and Evil. It was the Two Trees of Valinor. That tree was meant to be there, and so was everything inside of it. Sure, it was functionally infinite and everything in it was finite, but the tree wasn’t merely massive; it was intricate. In the grand scheme of things, nothing inside of it was superfluous. Everything, no matter its scale, was part of the ultimate design of the tree. You and I may not be any more important than anyone or anything else, but if we weren’t important, we wouldn’t be here.

I’m not entirely sure if any of my coworkers felt the same way though.

“Saint Peter don’t you call me, ’cause I can’t go,” Loebald continued to sing, only to be interrupted by Vothstag’s irate howling, his eyes burning like coals as he dared him to finish the chorus.

Loebald bowed his head contritely as he awkwardly cleared his throat. When Vothstag was satisfied he had been cowed into silence, he turned around to resume his work.

“’Cause I owe my soul to the company store,” I finished for him, not too loudly, but loud enough that everyone heard me.

Vothstag immediately came charging at me, roaring in fury, but I didn’t flinch. I just let him chew me out for about a minute until I heard something that I was pretty sure was a question.

“That’s ridiculous. You’re making more noise than either of us,” I countered. “And wasting more time. Now if you don’t mind, I’ve got work to do.”

Vothstag sneered at me, but since I had resumed my task, his job as taskmaster was complete, and he left to attend to other matters.

“What the hell are you doing, pushing your luck like that, Brandon?” Vinson whispered.

“He was out of line. Even chain gangs are allowed to sing,” I explained. “Besides, I’m right, aren’t I? If we attract any unwanted attention, it will be because of him.”

“This isn’t the place to cause trouble!” he hissed. “Fill the carts as fast as you can so we can get out of here!”

When we arrived at the Taproots, we saw that we weren’t the first beings to try to mine this deposit of sap. Someone, likely some clan of Unseelie Fae, had established a fairly complex operation with rails and hand carts. As convenient as this was for us, it did of course pose the uncomfortable question of why the site had been completely abandoned when it was obviously far from depleted.

Me, Vinson, Loebald, and Klaus were chipping away at the crystal sap, tossing what we could into a nearby trolley cart. When it was full, Hamm and Gristle would haul it off so that Fish and Chips could scoop it into twenty-kilogram bags, which Hamm and Gristle would then stack and secure onto skids.

And as always, Vothstag supervised.

“Sixteen bleedin’ tons of this bilge,” Vinson muttered as he took a swing at it with his pickaxe. “And he’s got the nerve to tell us it’s just an appetizer for a party guest. What do you suppose they’re going to do with it all.”

“Refine it into proper syrup, I imagine,” Loewald replied. “Make it into sweets and sodas, or just drizzle some of it straight onto flapjacks. Either way, they’ll make a killing. Sixteen tons will probably sell for millions.”

“Why though? Is it just exotic sugar?” I asked.

“What do you think?” Loewald asked rhetorically, gesturing at the source. “For reality benders, anything from the edges of reality is potent stuff. They put a lump of this in their morning coffee, and the Veil will seem as weak to them as it is here. There’s no telling what havoc they’ll get up to, so you better hope we’re not around to see.”

“Now you’re just being ridiculous. Clowns don’t drink coffee,” Vinson joked.

I was about to ask him how he would know, when Vothstag put his hand on my shoulder and spun me around. Hamm and Gristle had returned with the empty cart, but only Gristle was getting ready to pull the full one. Vothstag spewed some of his usual gibberish, gesturing at me and then towards Hamm’s empty space at the cart.

“Because I sang one line? Seriously?” I asked. I was about to throw Loewald under the bus for singing in the first place, but Vothstag was already roaring incomprehensibly. “Alright, alright. I’ll pull the damn cart.”

I handed my pickaxe over to Hamm, who instantly began swinging at the sap with manic enthusiasm. Gristle gave me a slight nod of condolence before Vothstag yoked me up to the cart like an ox and then sent us on our way with an angry shout.

“If you don’t mind me asking, how come Hamm deserves a break and you don’t?” I asked Gristle as we made our way down the track, the dinging of our colleague’s pickaxes slowly fading into the background.

Gristle looked over his shoulder to confirm the Vothstag was well out of earshot, and then turned his head towards mine.

“Vinson’s wrong, you know,” he said in a soft, conspiratorial whisper.

“Ah… I’m story?” I asked.

“About Clowns and coffee,” he clarified. “Icky drinks coffee. I’ve seen her do it. She takes it with double cream and sugar to keep it Clown Kosher, of course. She’s a little too classy to indulge in stereotypical candy binges, but she’s still got a sweet tooth like the rest of us.”

“…Us?” I asked uneasily.

Gristle nodded, lifting up his gas mask by the filter and revealing his face to me for the first time. His poreless skin was a lustrous white, but his lips, nose, and the space around his eyes were all pitch black, and the eyes themselves sparkled with the light of a thousand dying stars. His mouth was spread into an unnaturally wide smile, revealing that his teeth were not only perfect but shiny to the point that I could see myself in them.

And I looked terrified.

“Loewald was right though, about what this stuff will do to us,” he went on. “Once everything’s fully loaded, Hamm and I are going to take a mouthful each and then take the whole haul for ourselves. We’ll stash some of it away somewhere safe, then use the rest to buy our way back into the Circus. The only problem is getting there. That’s where you come in.”

“What are you on about? How can I possibly help you get back to your Circus?” I asked.

“With that Seelie coin you got in your pocket,” he said, lowering his voice so that I only barely heard him. “These carts weren’t meant to be powered manually, you know. They run on Faerie magic, and that coin’s got enough that we can drive all sixteen tons of our loot to anywhere in the worlds we want.”

I briefly considered denying that I even had the coin, but if he was determined, he could find and take it easily enough, so there really wasn’t any point.

“Ignoring for the moment how you even know I have that, why not ask Vinson?” I suggested. “He’s got way more Seelie Silver than I do.”

“He doesn’t want out. You do,” Gristle responded. “You tried to escape once, and I know you’re just itching for a chance to try again.”

“But… Ignazio knows what you are, doesn’t he? He wouldn’t have let you around the sap if he wasn’t prepared for you to try to take some,” I said.

“He doesn’t know Hamm and I can take our masks off without his say-so,” Gristle explained. “We’ve been living off meagre rations of powdered milk to keep us in line, but we were able to get a hold of a bottle of the fresh stuff and chugged it before we came here. Ignazio and Vothstag have no power over us right now.”

“… I’m sorry, milk?” I asked confused.

“Not important at the moment. Are you in or not?” he asked.

I considered his proposition for a moment, deciding on one final question before answering.    

“Why not just take the coin from me?”

“Because I’m a nice guy,” he said with a sickeningly wide grin. “And… stealing Seelie Silver tends not to end well. I don’t need an answer now. The load’s not full yet. Think about it, and when the time comes, do whatever you’ve got to do.”

He pulled his mask back down, and we finished hauling the cart over to Fish and Chips in silence.

He wasn’t wrong about me wanting to escape, but my plan had always been to quietly sneak off and be long gone before anyone noticed. A fight between Vothstag and a pair of superpowered Clowns followed by a daring getaway on an Unseelie mining cart was a bit riskier than anything I had envisioned. But at the same time, this was an unprecedented opportunity that would likely never come again.  From the Taproots of the World Tree, I could go literally anywhere, and never have to worry about Ignazio or his minions tracking me down.

All it would cost me was the single coin I had to my name.

I hauled the cart with Gristle for the rest of the shift. Eventually, we had a train of sixteen pallets, each loaded with fifty twenty-kilogram sacks of crystalized sap.

“That’s it then. Order’s full,” Vinson declared as he walked the length of the train, testing the chains to make sure the cargo was fully secured. “All of you hop in the front and let’s get the hell out of here.”

Vothstag roared in disagreement, standing between us and the cart and making a vaguely groping gesture.

“Right, right. Contraband check,” Vinson nodded with a weary sigh as he outstretched his arms. “Nothing too invasive now, you hear? If this stuff was inside of us, you’d already know it.”

Vothstag didn’t acknowledge his comment, but proceeded to pat him down and empty his pockets.

Hamm and Gristle each gave me a knowing look. If I did nothing, Vothstag would find my coin and it would all be over for me anyway. I nodded my assent, and braced myself for the worse.

With a single swift motion, Hamm and Gristle each pulled their masks off, and the visages of the two monstrous Clowns were enough to throw all of us into immediate pandemonium. Hamm’s hair, eyes, lips and nose were all a fiery red, and I saw now that the tips of their ears had a pink tinge, just like their fingers. The instant their masks were off, they wasted no time shovelling a handful of crystal sap into their mouths.

Vothstag howled and charged straight at them, and everyone else scattered as quickly as they could to avoid being bulldozed by the massive deer man. Hamm and Gristle stood their ground, each of them grabbing ahold of one of his antlers. Despite his size and speed, Vothstag was brought to a dead stop.

He snorted and bellowed as he tried to force himself forward, but he was completely unable to overpower the two Clowns. Hamm and Gristle exchanged sinister smiles and began to spin Vothstag around and around. Within seconds his feet were off the ground, and with each rotation, he gained more and more momentum until his attackers finally let go of his antlers and sent him flying into the distance.

“The rest of you, stay out of our way!” Gristle shouted as he marched towards the front cart, grabbing me by the scruff of my jacket and pulling me along with him.

“Wait, why? Why can’t they come? Why can’t we all go?” I protested.

“We don’t know what half these freaks are and we don’t trust them,” he said as he tossed me onto the cart. “Now drive. Go straight until I say otherwise.”

I looked out at my confused and frightened companions, and took a bit of solace in the fact that they weren’t entirely certain if I had betrayed them or if I was just being kidnapped. I hesitated for a moment, but Hamm’s sharp talons digging into my shoulder were enough to press me into action.

With my coin of Seelie Silver clutched in my right palm, I grabbed a firm hold of the driving shaft and pushed the train forward. It accelerated at a remarkable pace, and before I knew it, we were speeding away from our work site and towards freedom.

“It’s working. It’s actually working,” Gristle laughed in relief.

“Even Vothstag can’t run this fast!” Hamm declared triumphantly. “The whole haul is ours! We’re rich! We’re free!”

I wanted to celebrate with them. I really did. But deep down inside I knew we weren’t out of the woods yet.

“You guys read that dossier Iggy gave us, right?” I asked. “The Naught Things that gnaw the Taproots are attracted to ontological anchors – anything that’s more real than its surroundings. If you guys are reality benders, and you just ate a massive power-up, doesn’t that make you the realest things here?”

“Isn’t that cute? He thinks he knows more about ontodynamics than us because he read a dossier,” Hamm scoffed.

“This isn’t our first time on the fringes of the unreal, boy!” Gristle replied. “You just drive this train, and let us worry about –”

Without warning, the Taproot split open ahead of us into a fuming, festering chasm. The ground quake was enough to completely derail the train, and I ducked and rolled while I had the chance.

When I came out of the roll, I looked up to see a titanic, disfigured, and disembodied head rising out of the chasm. The size and proportions of the entity fluctuated wildly, as if I was only looking at the three-dimensional facets of it like the World Tree itself. It was encrusted with some kind of dark barnacles, and anything that wasn’t its face was covered in thousands of squirming and feathery tentacles of every conceivable length. It had no nose, but several mouths which chanted backwards-sounding words in synchronicity with each other, dropping rotting black teeth every time they opened and closed. 

There were six randomly spaced and variously sized eyeballs darting around independently of each other, each glowing with a sickly yellow light. I was paralyzed in fear, terrified that the Naught Thing would see me, but all six of its eyes soon locked onto Hamm and Gristle.

As it slowly ascended upwards like a hot air balloon, a pair of flickering tongues shot out of two of its mouths with predatory intent. The Clowns were scooped up like flies, screaming as they were whisked back into the Naught Thing’s cavernous maws. I don’t know much about Clowns or what they’re capable of, only that Hamm and Gristle never got a chance to test their mettle against this behemoth. A few chomps of its black teeth, and it was all over.

I sat there in silence, watching as the Naught Thing continued to drift away, never daring to assume that it had forgotten about me.

“Brandon!” I heard a voice call from the distance.

I was finally able to pull my eyes off the Naught Thing, and when I looked down the track, I saw the rest of my crew hurrying towards me.

Which included a very angry Vothstag.

Grabbing me by the jacket and lifting me off the ground, he roared furiously in my face, demanding answers.

“Easy, Vothstag, easy!” Vinson insisted. “They just grabbed the kid. It wasn’t his idea.”

Vothstag growled skeptically, eyeing the toppled train beside us. He knew it could have only been driven like that by Seelie magic, and I still had my lucky coin clutched tightly in my right hand.

“…Hamm must have picked my pocket when he was working alongside us,” Vinson suggested.

I knew he didn’t really think that. He knew exactly how many coins he had, and he knew he wasn’t missing any. I don’t know why he covered for me, but I owe him big.

“Serves him right, too. Bloody idiot,” he said with a sad shake of his head as he surveyed the wreckage. “Let this be a lesson for all of you if you ever think about stealing my Seelie Silver! That’s right, Fish and Chips, I’m looking at you!”

Vothstag howled again, clearly unconvinced.

“They took me as a driver so that they could stay focused on defending the train!” I claimed. “If I hadn’t jumped when I did, they may have stood a chance against that giant floating head! I saved our haul!”

Vothstag snorted in contempt, but set me back on my feet. I don’t think he believed me, really, but he knew that Ignazio wouldn’t hold him blameless in this little debacle either, so it was in all of our best interests not to cast aspersions on one another’s stories.

“Listen up, everybody! We’re two men down and we’ve got to get this rig back on the track before some other unspeakable abomination comes along, so get moving!” Vinson ordered.

For once, Vothstag was doing most of the work, using his might to set the carts back on the tracks, while the rest of us just picked up any sacks of sap that had come loose.

“What a bloody joke,” Loewald grumbled as he threw a sack onto a cart. “Down from nine to seven, any of us could still die at any minute, and for what? We mined sixteen tons, and what do we get?”

“Another day older,” I agreed, throwing another sack next to his. “But some days, that’s enough.”",1,1729650476.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

I spent the first 6 months just getting the aeration and texturing correct. I must have watched hundreds of YT videos, browsed all the coffee related forums, and of course Reddit. 

My tip for beginners is that you must learn how to steam milk correctly for latte art. Every machine is different. You will have to spend time to get used to how your steam wand operates. Some YT videos may say aerate for only 4-5s but fail to mention they are using a commercial class machine. On my BBP, I have to aerate for 10-18s depending on various factors to get the correct consistency.  If you don’t have the correct milk consistency, then you won’t be able to ‘draw.’

For the past year or two – I’m honestly not sure how long it’s been, actually – I’ve been under contract for an otherworldly masked Lord who calls himself Ignazio di Incognauta. He’s not a demon, exactly. He’s closer to Fae, I think, but I don’t fully understand what he is. I never sought him out. He came to me. I asked him how he even knew who I was, and he slapped me across the face for my insolence.

I still signed up though. That’s how desperate I was. He doesn’t waste his time offering deals to people who can say no.

He sends me and the rest of my crew out on what I can best describe as odd jobs. Half the time – hell, most of the time – I’m not even sure exactly what it is we’re doing. Most of the crew have been around longer than I have, and some of them aren’t human, but they all seem to have a better idea of what’s going on than me.

Our foreman Vothstag is technically the one in charge, but he’s not all there in the head; the top of his cranium’s been removed and a good chunk of his brain’s been scooped out. He mostly just barks guttural nonsense that none of us really understand, but somehow compels us to do what we’re supposed to, even when we don’t know what that is. He’s a hulking hunchback with an overgrown beard who usually wears an elk skull to cover up the hole in his head. If he was ever human, I don’t think he is now.

Vinson is our *de facto* leader, however, since he’s more or less a normal guy that we can relate to. Aside from Vothstag, he’s been working for Ignazio the longest. I won’t bother describing what he looks like, since the rest of us wear gas masks on duty. They’re partially to protect us from environmental and workplace hazards, partially to conceal our identities, but mainly to bring us more easily under Ignazio’s control.

That was why were all wearing our masks on the elevator, incidentally. We were on our way to see the big boss, and our contracts made it very clear we were never to remove our masks in his presence.  

“Come on, Vinson. You know meetings with Iggy never go well,” I replied bluntly.

“Oh, it’s just bluster. You know that. He’s got to put the fear of God into us,” Vinson claimed. “If he wasn’t actually satisfied with our performance, we wouldn’t still be here.”

“No, Brandon’s right. Iggy wouldn’t have called all ten of us in just to hand us our scrip and call us lazy arses,” Loewald chimed in.

“There’s nine of us, now,” Klaus reminded him grimly.

“Right, sorry. Hard to keep track some days,” Loewald admitted. “Regardless; something’s up, and the odds are pretty slim it will be something we like.”

I cringed as Vothstag shouted some of his garbled nonsense back towards Loewald.

“Yes, I know we’re not being paid to have fun, but –”

“We’re not being paid at all!” Klaus interrupted. “None of us are getting any real money until our contracts are up, and have any of you actually known anyone who made it to the end of their contract?” 

He recoiled as Vothstag spun around and began roaring at him, hot spittle flying out from beneath his mask of carved bone as he furiously waved his fist in his face.

“He’s right, Klaus. You’re being paranoid,” Vinson said in an eerily calm tone. “I’ve served out multiple contracts, and I’ve got the silver to prove it.”

He confidently reached into his pocket and held a troy-ounce coin of Seelie Silver between his fingers. Fish and Chips, the pair of three-foot-tall… *somethings* that work for us immediately crowded around him and began eyeing it greedily.

“That’s right boys, take a gander. That’s powerful magic right there, and you’ll get one of these for every moon you’ve worked at the end of your contracts,” he reminded us before quickly pocketing the coin away again. “Unless, of course, you do something to get your contract prematurely terminated; then you’ll have nothing to show for it but a fistful of expired scrip! So keep your heads down, mouths shut, and your eyes on the prize. You’ll have pockets jangling full of coins soon enough.”

As discreetly as I could, I slipped my hands into my pockets and rubbed my one Seelie coin for good luck. None of them knew I had it, because I didn’t want to explain how I got it, but that little bit of fortune it brought me had almost been enough to let me escape [once](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/comments/yzlz7s/dont_shop_at_the_isomart_after_dark/).

If I could just muster up the skill to make the best use of my luck, it would be enough to get me out for good one day.

The freight elevator finally came to a stop, and the doors creaked open to reveal the spacious and sumptuous penthouse of our employer. Portraits, animal heads, shields, weapons, and most of all masquerade masks covered nearly every square inch of the walls. Amidst the suits of armour and porcelain vases, there were dozens of priceless ornaments strewn throughout the room. They were incredibly tempting to steal, which was their whole point. Stealing from the boss was a violation of your contract, and you did not want to break your contract.  

The wide windows on the far wall offered a panoramic view of our decaying company town, nestled in a valley between sharp crimson mountains beneath a xanthous sky twinkling with a thousand black stars. You may have heard of such a place before, it has many names, but I will speak none of them here. 

Ignazio was sitting on a reclining couch in front of the fireplace, some paperwork left out on the coffee table and a featureless mask like a silver spiderweb clutched in his hand. Ignazio himself always wore the top half of a golden Oni mask, which in and of itself wasn’t unusual for our company, but the odd thing was that several portraits in the penthouse showed that it had once been a full mask.

I’ve always wondered what happened to the bottom half.  

Aside from that, Ignazio wasn’t too unusual looking. He was tall, skinny, and swarthy with a pronounced chin, tousled dark brown hair and always dressed in doublets of silk and velvet like he was performing Shakespeare or something.

Vothstag went into the room first, with Vinson almost, but not quite, at his side. Fish and Chips scamped after them, followed by Loewald, Klaus, and myself.

The last two members of our crew are called Hamm and Gristle, and they’re the two I know the least about. They keep to themselves, and I don’t think I’ve ever even seen them with their masks off. I have seen them without gloves on though, and both of their hands are white with pink-tinged fingers. I have no idea what that means, but for some reason, I always found it oddly unsettling.

The only thing I know for sure about them is that they’re the only survivors of another crew that tried to run out on their contract, and I know better than to ask for details about that.

“Gentlemen, Gentlemen, right on time,” Ignazio greeted us as he waved us over. He positioned himself on his couch to make it impossible for any of us to sit beside him, and none of us dared to take a seat at any of the clawfooted armchairs that were meant for guests with much higher stations in life. “I’ve got this moon’s scrip books all stamped and approved. You’ll notice they’re a bit light, seeing as how you were slightly behind quota on this assignment.”

None of us objected, and none of us were particularly surprised. I was grateful that the mask hid my expression, and I’m sure I wasn’t the only one. I still had to make an effort to mind my body language though. Being so accustomed to his employees and compatriots wearing masks, Ignazio was quite astute to body language.

Vinson accepted the stack of nine booklets and nodded gratefully.

“We appreciate your leniency, my lord, and look forward to earning back our privileges on our next assignment,” he said.

“I was hoping you’d say that,” Ignazio grinned as he took a sip from his crystal chalice. He set it down on the coffee table and picked up a dossier. “Halloween is fast approaching, and that means we need costumes and candy. Costumes we have in abundance, obviously, but candy’s one vice I don’t usually keep well stocked.”

“So we’re actually stealing candy from babies on our next job?” Klaus asked.

“Nothing so quotidian,” Ignazio sneered. “Remind me; have any of you met Icky before?”

The name meant nothing to me, but I glanced from side to side to see if anyone else reacted to it. I could have sworn I saw Hamm and Gristle perk their heads up slightly.

“She’s that Clown woman, right? The one in charge of that god-awful circus?” Vinson asked.

“I beg your pardon? It’s an enchanted Circus that travels the worlds and offers sanctuary to paranormal vagabonds in need,” Ignazio claimed half-heartedly. “And I might be able to pawn a few of you off on them if it comes to that, so be careful you don’t fall any further behind on your quotas. But you’re right; she is a Clown, with a capital C, and Clowns love candy. She’ll be attending my All Hallows’ Ball this year, and I don’t want her to feel excluded, so we’ll need some real top-shelf candy on offer.”

“Ah… we’re still waiting for the other shoe to drop here, boss,” Vinson confessed as most of us shared nervous glances with one another. “You want us to get candy? Fancy candy? I… I don’t get it. What’s the catch?”   

“Oh god, we’re not taking it from babies: we’re serving the babies with it!” Loewald balked in horror.

“No, but thank you for that highball to make the actual assignment seem more reasonable,” Ignazio said. “No, I’m sending you all down to the Taproots of the World Tree to collect some of the crystalized sap there.”

“The… The Taproots of the World Tree?” Vinson repeated softly. “The physical manifestation of the metaphysical network that binds all the worlds and planes of Creation, gnawed at by the Naught Things trying to break their way into reality? You’re sending us down there… for sweets?”

“Icky swears that Yggdrasil syrup pairs beautifully with French Toast,” he replied blithely. “This is an especially dangerous assignment, so I want you all to read that dossier in full. Emrys has been charting and forging new pathways through the planes from his spire in Adderwood, so thanks to him your trip down at least will be relatively easy.”

“Just… just there and back, right?” Vinson asked desperately, his voice wavering. “Just a handful of the stuff to wow Icky, and we’re done, right?”

A sadistic smirk slowly spread across Ignazio’s face before he told us how much crystalized sap we would need to retrieve.

\*\*\*

“You mine sixteen tons, what do you get? Another day older, and deeper in debt,” Loebald sang as he chipped away at the pulsing amber crystal emerging from the leviathan root.

The World Tree was cosmically colossal, though it’s meaningless to describe its size since I can only describe the parts of it that exist in three dimensions. The twin trunks of the tree snaked around each other like a double helix, each alight with an ever-shifting astral aura that perpetually waxed and waned in synchronicity with its twin. From its crown sprung a seemingly infinite mass of fractally dividing branches, shimmering with countless spherical ‘leaves’ which I knew to be individual universes. The base of the tree spawned an equally infinite mass of sprawling taproots, anchoring it in place and drawing precious sustenance from the edges of reality.  

As dangerous as it was to be there, it was nonetheless a sublime experience. You think that looking upon all of existence like that would fill you with Lovecraftian madness at your own insignificance, but it was far more transcendental than that. On some fundamental level, I recognized that tree. It was Yggdrasil. It was the Biblical tree of Good and Evil. It was the Two Trees of Valinor. That tree was meant to be there, and so was everything inside of it. Sure, it was functionally infinite and everything in it was finite, but the tree wasn’t merely massive; it was intricate. In the grand scheme of things, nothing inside of it was superfluous. Everything, no matter its scale, was part of the ultimate design of the tree. You and I may not be any more important than anyone or anything else, but if we weren’t important, we wouldn’t be here.

I’m not entirely sure if any of my coworkers felt the same way though.

“Saint Peter don’t you call me, ’cause I can’t go,” Loebald continued to sing, only to be interrupted by Vothstag’s irate howling, his eyes burning like coals as he dared him to finish the chorus.

Loebald bowed his head contritely as he awkwardly cleared his throat. When Vothstag was satisfied he had been cowed into silence, he turned around to resume his work.

“’Cause I owe my soul to the company store,” I finished for him, not too loudly, but loud enough that everyone heard me.

Vothstag immediately came charging at me, roaring in fury, but I didn’t flinch. I just let him chew me out for about a minute until I heard something that I was pretty sure was a question.

“That’s ridiculous. You’re making more noise than either of us,” I countered. “And wasting more time. Now if you don’t mind, I’ve got work to do.”

Vothstag sneered at me, but since I had resumed my task, his job as taskmaster was complete, and he left to attend to other matters.

“What the hell are you doing, pushing your luck like that, Brandon?” Vinson whispered.

“He was out of line. Even chain gangs are allowed to sing,” I explained. “Besides, I’m right, aren’t I? If we attract any unwanted attention, it will be because of him.”

“This isn’t the place to cause trouble!” he hissed. “Fill the carts as fast as you can so we can get out of here!”

When we arrived at the Taproots, we saw that we weren’t the first beings to try to mine this deposit of sap. Someone, likely some clan of Unseelie Fae, had established a fairly complex operation with rails and hand carts. As convenient as this was for us, it did of course pose the uncomfortable question of why the site had been completely abandoned when it was obviously far from depleted.

Me, Vinson, Loebald, and Klaus were chipping away at the crystal sap, tossing what we could into a nearby trolley cart. When it was full, Hamm and Gristle would haul it off so that Fish and Chips could scoop it into twenty-kilogram bags, which Hamm and Gristle would then stack and secure onto skids.

And as always, Vothstag supervised.

“Sixteen bleedin’ tons of this bilge,” Vinson muttered as he took a swing at it with his pickaxe. “And he’s got the nerve to tell us it’s just an appetizer for a party guest. What do you suppose they’re going to do with it all.”

“Refine it into proper syrup, I imagine,” Loewald replied. “Make it into sweets and sodas, or just drizzle some of it straight onto flapjacks. Either way, they’ll make a killing. Sixteen tons will probably sell for millions.”

“Why though? Is it just exotic sugar?” I asked.

“What do you think?” Loewald asked rhetorically, gesturing at the source. “For reality benders, anything from the edges of reality is potent stuff. They put a lump of this in their morning coffee, and the Veil will seem as weak to them as it is here. There’s no telling what havoc they’ll get up to, so you better hope we’re not around to see.”

“Now you’re just being ridiculous. Clowns don’t drink coffee,” Vinson joked.

I was about to ask him how he would know, when Vothstag put his hand on my shoulder and spun me around. Hamm and Gristle had returned with the empty cart, but only Gristle was getting ready to pull the full one. Vothstag spewed some of his usual gibberish, gesturing at me and then towards Hamm’s empty space at the cart.

“Because I sang one line? Seriously?” I asked. I was about to throw Loewald under the bus for singing in the first place, but Vothstag was already roaring incomprehensibly. “Alright, alright. I’ll pull the damn cart.”

I handed my pickaxe over to Hamm, who instantly began swinging at the sap with manic enthusiasm. Gristle gave me a slight nod of condolence before Vothstag yoked me up to the cart like an ox and then sent us on our way with an angry shout.

“If you don’t mind me asking, how come Hamm deserves a break and you don’t?” I asked Gristle as we made our way down the track, the dinging of our colleague’s pickaxes slowly fading into the background.

Gristle looked over his shoulder to confirm the Vothstag was well out of earshot, and then turned his head towards mine.

“Vinson’s wrong, you know,” he said in a soft, conspiratorial whisper.

“Ah… I’m story?” I asked.

“About Clowns and coffee,” he clarified. “Icky drinks coffee. I’ve seen her do it. She takes it with double cream and sugar to keep it Clown Kosher, of course. She’s a little too classy to indulge in stereotypical candy binges, but she’s still got a sweet tooth like the rest of us.”

“…Us?” I asked uneasily.

Gristle nodded, lifting up his gas mask by the filter and revealing his face to me for the first time. His poreless skin was a lustrous white, but his lips, nose, and the space around his eyes were all pitch black, and the eyes themselves sparkled with the light of a thousand dying stars. His mouth was spread into an unnaturally wide smile, revealing that his teeth were not only perfect but shiny to the point that I could see myself in them.

And I looked terrified.

“Loewald was right though, about what this stuff will do to us,” he went on. “Once everything’s fully loaded, Hamm and I are going to take a mouthful each and then take the whole haul for ourselves. We’ll stash some of it away somewhere safe, then use the rest to buy our way back into the Circus. The only problem is getting there. That’s where you come in.”

“What are you on about? How can I possibly help you get back to your Circus?” I asked.

“With that Seelie coin you got in your pocket,” he said, lowering his voice so that I only barely heard him. “These carts weren’t meant to be powered manually, you know. They run on Faerie magic, and that coin’s got enough that we can drive all sixteen tons of our loot to anywhere in the worlds we want.”

I briefly considered denying that I even had the coin, but if he was determined, he could find and take it easily enough, so there really wasn’t any point.

“Ignoring for the moment how you even know I have that, why not ask Vinson?” I suggested. “He’s got way more Seelie Silver than I do.”

“He doesn’t want out. You do,” Gristle responded. “You tried to escape once, and I know you’re just itching for a chance to try again.”

“But… Ignazio knows what you are, doesn’t he? He wouldn’t have let you around the sap if he wasn’t prepared for you to try to take some,” I said.

“He doesn’t know Hamm and I can take our masks off without his say-so,” Gristle explained. “We’ve been living off meagre rations of powdered milk to keep us in line, but we were able to get a hold of a bottle of the fresh stuff and chugged it before we came here. Ignazio and Vothstag have no power over us right now.”

“… I’m sorry, milk?” I asked confused.

“Not important at the moment. Are you in or not?” he asked.

I considered his proposition for a moment, deciding on one final question before answering.    

“Why not just take the coin from me?”

“Because I’m a nice guy,” he said with a sickeningly wide grin. “And… stealing Seelie Silver tends not to end well. I don’t need an answer now. The load’s not full yet. Think about it, and when the time comes, do whatever you’ve got to do.”

He pulled his mask back down, and we finished hauling the cart over to Fish and Chips in silence.

He wasn’t wrong about me wanting to escape, but my plan had always been to quietly sneak off and be long gone before anyone noticed. A fight between Vothstag and a pair of superpowered Clowns followed by a daring getaway on an Unseelie mining cart was a bit riskier than anything I had envisioned. But at the same time, this was an unprecedented opportunity that would likely never come again.  From the Taproots of the World Tree, I could go literally anywhere, and never have to worry about Ignazio or his minions tracking me down.

All it would cost me was the single coin I had to my name.

I hauled the cart with Gristle for the rest of the shift. Eventually, we had a train of sixteen pallets, each loaded with fifty twenty-kilogram sacks of crystalized sap.

“That’s it then. Order’s full,” Vinson declared as he walked the length of the train, testing the chains to make sure the cargo was fully secured. “All of you hop in the front and let’s get the hell out of here.”

Vothstag roared in disagreement, standing between us and the cart and making a vaguely groping gesture.

“Right, right. Contraband check,” Vinson nodded with a weary sigh as he outstretched his arms. “Nothing too invasive now, you hear? If this stuff was inside of us, you’d already know it.”

Vothstag didn’t acknowledge his comment, but proceeded to pat him down and empty his pockets.

Hamm and Gristle each gave me a knowing look. If I did nothing, Vothstag would find my coin and it would all be over for me anyway. I nodded my assent, and braced myself for the worse.

With a single swift motion, Hamm and Gristle each pulled their masks off, and the visages of the two monstrous Clowns were enough to throw all of us into immediate pandemonium. Hamm’s hair, eyes, lips and nose were all a fiery red, and I saw now that the tips of their ears had a pink tinge, just like their fingers. The instant their masks were off, they wasted no time shovelling a handful of crystal sap into their mouths.

Vothstag howled and charged straight at them, and everyone else scattered as quickly as they could to avoid being bulldozed by the massive deer man. Hamm and Gristle stood their ground, each of them grabbing ahold of one of his antlers. Despite his size and speed, Vothstag was brought to a dead stop.

He snorted and bellowed as he tried to force himself forward, but he was completely unable to overpower the two Clowns. Hamm and Gristle exchanged sinister smiles and began to spin Vothstag around and around. Within seconds his feet were off the ground, and with each rotation, he gained more and more momentum until his attackers finally let go of his antlers and sent him flying into the distance.

“The rest of you, stay out of our way!” Gristle shouted as he marched towards the front cart, grabbing me by the scruff of my jacket and pulling me along with him.

“Wait, why? Why can’t they come? Why can’t we all go?” I protested.

“We don’t know what half these freaks are and we don’t trust them,” he said as he tossed me onto the cart. “Now drive. Go straight until I say otherwise.”

I looked out at my confused and frightened companions, and took a bit of solace in the fact that they weren’t entirely certain if I had betrayed them or if I was just being kidnapped. I hesitated for a moment, but Hamm’s sharp talons digging into my shoulder were enough to press me into action.

With my coin of Seelie Silver clutched in my right palm, I grabbed a firm hold of the driving shaft and pushed the train forward. It accelerated at a remarkable pace, and before I knew it, we were speeding away from our work site and towards freedom.

“It’s working. It’s actually working,” Gristle laughed in relief.

“Even Vothstag can’t run this fast!” Hamm declared triumphantly. “The whole haul is ours! We’re rich! We’re free!”

I wanted to celebrate with them. I really did. But deep down inside I knew we weren’t out of the woods yet.

“You guys read that dossier Iggy gave us, right?” I asked. “The Naught Things that gnaw the Taproots are attracted to ontological anchors – anything that’s more real than its surroundings. If you guys are reality benders, and you just ate a massive power-up, doesn’t that make you the realest things here?”

“Isn’t that cute? He thinks he knows more about ontodynamics than us because he read a dossier,” Hamm scoffed.

“This isn’t our first time on the fringes of the unreal, boy!” Gristle replied. “You just drive this train, and let us worry about –”

Without warning, the Taproot split open ahead of us into a fuming, festering chasm. The ground quake was enough to completely derail the train, and I ducked and rolled while I had the chance.

When I came out of the roll, I looked up to see a titanic, disfigured, and disembodied head rising out of the chasm. The size and proportions of the entity fluctuated wildly, as if I was only looking at the three-dimensional facets of it like the World Tree itself. It was encrusted with some kind of dark barnacles, and anything that wasn’t its face was covered in thousands of squirming and feathery tentacles of every conceivable length. It had no nose, but several mouths which chanted backwards-sounding words in synchronicity with each other, dropping rotting black teeth every time they opened and closed. 

There were six randomly spaced and variously sized eyeballs darting around independently of each other, each glowing with a sickly yellow light. I was paralyzed in fear, terrified that the Naught Thing would see me, but all six of its eyes soon locked onto Hamm and Gristle.

As it slowly ascended upwards like a hot air balloon, a pair of flickering tongues shot out of two of its mouths with predatory intent. The Clowns were scooped up like flies, screaming as they were whisked back into the Naught Thing’s cavernous maws. I don’t know much about Clowns or what they’re capable of, only that Hamm and Gristle never got a chance to test their mettle against this behemoth. A few chomps of its black teeth, and it was all over.

I sat there in silence, watching as the Naught Thing continued to drift away, never daring to assume that it had forgotten about me.

“Brandon!” I heard a voice call from the distance.

I was finally able to pull my eyes off the Naught Thing, and when I looked down the track, I saw the rest of my crew hurrying towards me.

Which included a very angry Vothstag.

Grabbing me by the jacket and lifting me off the ground, he roared furiously in my face, demanding answers.

“Easy, Vothstag, easy!” Vinson insisted. “They just grabbed the kid. It wasn’t his idea.”

Vothstag growled skeptically, eyeing the toppled train beside us. He knew it could have only been driven like that by Seelie magic, and I still had my lucky coin clutched tightly in my right hand.

“…Hamm must have picked my pocket when he was working alongside us,” Vinson suggested.

I knew he didn’t really think that. He knew exactly how many coins he had, and he knew he wasn’t missing any. I don’t know why he covered for me, but I owe him big.

“Serves him right, too. Bloody idiot,” he said with a sad shake of his head as he surveyed the wreckage. “Let this be a lesson for all of you if you ever think about stealing my Seelie Silver! That’s right, Fish and Chips, I’m looking at you!”

Vothstag howled again, clearly unconvinced.

“They took me as a driver so that they could stay focused on defending the train!” I claimed. “If I hadn’t jumped when I did, they may have stood a chance against that giant floating head! I saved our haul!”

Vothstag snorted in contempt, but set me back on my feet. I don’t think he believed me, really, but he knew that Ignazio wouldn’t hold him blameless in this little debacle either, so it was in all of our best interests not to cast aspersions on one another’s stories.

“Listen up, everybody! We’re two men down and we’ve got to get this rig back on the track before some other unspeakable abomination comes along, so get moving!” Vinson ordered.

For once, Vothstag was doing most of the work, using his might to set the carts back on the tracks, while the rest of us just picked up any sacks of sap that had come loose.

“What a bloody joke,” Loewald grumbled as he threw a sack onto a cart. “Down from nine to seven, any of us could still die at any minute, and for what? We mined sixteen tons, and what do we get?”

“Another day older,” I agreed, throwing another sack next to his. “But some days, that’s enough.”",1,1729650329.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1g9zu9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1g9zu9e/holiday_cafe_brunch_mixer/,Holiday Cafe & Brunch Mixer,"For the past 11 years, I have hosted an evening holiday cocktail mixer with heavy apps/sides for about 40-50 people annually. I always make the same food and generally have the same vibe. This year I was thinking of switching it up and doing something different. I was thinking of hosting a Brunch mixer and having a coffee bar, mimosas bar, and bagel bar with topping and maybe a few other dishes set up for a mid-day party instead of in the evening. 

However, I have been unable to find anyone on the internet who has done something similar. I'm sure this is not a new concept but it just hasn't been digitally documented. Posing a few questions to this thread:

1. Would you be excited to receive an invite to this type of party? (particularly day time vs night time.)
2. What would you serve at this type of party? How many different types of coffee would you serve? What food would you make for that many people to casually graze on?
3. How would you manage the vibe of the party since more people will likely be coming and going rather than showing up st the beginning and staying all night?",3,1729650271.0,Cooking,0,0.81,False
1g9ztvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1g9ztvp/sixteen_tons/,Sixteen Tons,"“What’s got you in such a sour mood, Brandon? It’s payday!” my veteran colleague Vinson asked as the rusty freight elevator noisily rattled its way up towards the penthouse suite.

For the past year or two – I’m honestly not sure how long it’s been, actually – I’ve been under contract for an otherworldly masked Lord who calls himself Ignazio di Incognauta. He’s not a demon, exactly. He’s closer to Fae, I think, but I don’t fully understand what he is. I never sought him out. He came to me. I asked him how he even knew who I was, and he slapped me across the face for my insolence.

I still signed up though. That’s how desperate I was. He doesn’t waste his time offering deals to people who can say no.

He sends me and the rest of my crew out on what I can best describe as odd jobs. Half the time – hell, most of the time – I’m not even sure exactly what it is we’re doing. Most of the crew have been around longer than I have, and some of them aren’t human, but they all seem to have a better idea of what’s going on than me.

Our foreman Vothstag is technically the one in charge, but he’s not all there in the head; the top of his cranium’s been removed and a good chunk of his brain’s been scooped out. He mostly just barks guttural nonsense that none of us really understand, but somehow compels us to do what we’re supposed to, even when we don’t know what that is. He’s a hulking hunchback with an overgrown beard who usually wears an elk skull to cover up the hole in his head. If he was ever human, I don’t think he is now.

Vinson is our *de facto* leader, however, since he’s more or less a normal guy that we can relate to. Aside from Vothstag, he’s been working for Ignazio the longest. I won’t bother describing what he looks like, since the rest of us wear gas masks on duty. They’re partially to protect us from environmental and workplace hazards, partially to conceal our identities, but mainly to bring us more easily under Ignazio’s control.

That was why were all wearing our masks on the elevator, incidentally. We were on our way to see the big boss, and our contracts made it very clear we were never to remove our masks in his presence.  

“Come on, Vinson. You know meetings with Iggy never go well,” I replied bluntly.

“Oh, it’s just bluster. You know that. He’s got to put the fear of God into us,” Vinson claimed. “If he wasn’t actually satisfied with our performance, we wouldn’t still be here.”

“No, Brandon’s right. Iggy wouldn’t have called all ten of us in just to hand us our scrip and call us lazy arses,” Loewald chimed in.

“There’s nine of us, now,” Klaus reminded him grimly.

“Right, sorry. Hard to keep track some days,” Loewald admitted. “Regardless; something’s up, and the odds are pretty slim it will be something we like.”

I cringed as Vothstag shouted some of his garbled nonsense back towards Loewald.

“Yes, I know we’re not being paid to have fun, but –”

“We’re not being paid at all!” Klaus interrupted. “None of us are getting any real money until our contracts are up, and have any of you actually known anyone who made it to the end of their contract?” 

He recoiled as Vothstag spun around and began roaring at him, hot spittle flying out from beneath his mask of carved bone as he furiously waved his fist in his face.

“He’s right, Klaus. You’re being paranoid,” Vinson said in an eerily calm tone. “I’ve served out multiple contracts, and I’ve got the silver to prove it.”

He confidently reached into his pocket and held a troy-ounce coin of Seelie Silver between his fingers. Fish and Chips, the pair of three-foot-tall… *somethings* that work for us immediately crowded around him and began eyeing it greedily.

“That’s right boys, take a gander. That’s powerful magic right there, and you’ll get one of these for every moon you’ve worked at the end of your contracts,” he reminded us before quickly pocketing the coin away again. “Unless, of course, you do something to get your contract prematurely terminated; then you’ll have nothing to show for it but a fistful of expired scrip! So keep your heads down, mouths shut, and your eyes on the prize. You’ll have pockets jangling full of coins soon enough.”

As discreetly as I could, I slipped my hands into my pockets and rubbed my one Seelie coin for good luck. None of them knew I had it, because I didn’t want to explain how I got it, but that little bit of fortune it brought me had almost been enough to let me escape [once](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/comments/yzlz7s/dont_shop_at_the_isomart_after_dark/).

If I could just muster up the skill to make the best use of my luck, it would be enough to get me out for good one day.

The freight elevator finally came to a stop, and the doors creaked open to reveal the spacious and sumptuous penthouse of our employer. Portraits, animal heads, shields, weapons, and most of all masquerade masks covered nearly every square inch of the walls. Amidst the suits of armour and porcelain vases, there were dozens of priceless ornaments strewn throughout the room. They were incredibly tempting to steal, which was their whole point. Stealing from the boss was a violation of your contract, and you did not want to break your contract.  

The wide windows on the far wall offered a panoramic view of our decaying company town, nestled in a valley between sharp crimson mountains beneath a xanthous sky twinkling with a thousand black stars. You may have heard of such a place before, it has many names, but I will speak none of them here. 

Ignazio was sitting on a reclining couch in front of the fireplace, some paperwork left out on the coffee table and a featureless mask like a silver spiderweb clutched in his hand. Ignazio himself always wore the top half of a golden Oni mask, which in and of itself wasn’t unusual for our company, but the odd thing was that several portraits in the penthouse showed that it had once been a full mask.

I’ve always wondered what happened to the bottom half.  

Aside from that, Ignazio wasn’t too unusual looking. He was tall, skinny, and swarthy with a pronounced chin, tousled dark brown hair and always dressed in doublets of silk and velvet like he was performing Shakespeare or something.

Vothstag went into the room first, with Vinson almost, but not quite, at his side. Fish and Chips scamped after them, followed by Loewald, Klaus, and myself.

The last two members of our crew are called Hamm and Gristle, and they’re the two I know the least about. They keep to themselves, and I don’t think I’ve ever even seen them with their masks off. I have seen them without gloves on though, and both of their hands are white with pink-tinged fingers. I have no idea what that means, but for some reason, I always found it oddly unsettling.

The only thing I know for sure about them is that they’re the only survivors of another crew that tried to run out on their contract, and I know better than to ask for details about that.

“Gentlemen, Gentlemen, right on time,” Ignazio greeted us as he waved us over. He positioned himself on his couch to make it impossible for any of us to sit beside him, and none of us dared to take a seat at any of the clawfooted armchairs that were meant for guests with much higher stations in life. “I’ve got this moon’s scrip books all stamped and approved. You’ll notice they’re a bit light, seeing as how you were slightly behind quota on this assignment.”

None of us objected, and none of us were particularly surprised. I was grateful that the mask hid my expression, and I’m sure I wasn’t the only one. I still had to make an effort to mind my body language though. Being so accustomed to his employees and compatriots wearing masks, Ignazio was quite astute to body language.

Vinson accepted the stack of nine booklets and nodded gratefully.

“We appreciate your leniency, my lord, and look forward to earning back our privileges on our next assignment,” he said.

“I was hoping you’d say that,” Ignazio grinned as he took a sip from his crystal chalice. He set it down on the coffee table and picked up a dossier. “Halloween is fast approaching, and that means we need costumes and candy. Costumes we have in abundance, obviously, but candy’s one vice I don’t usually keep well stocked.”

“So we’re actually stealing candy from babies on our next job?” Klaus asked.

“Nothing so quotidian,” Ignazio sneered. “Remind me; have any of you met Icky before?”

The name meant nothing to me, but I glanced from side to side to see if anyone else reacted to it. I could have sworn I saw Hamm and Gristle perk their heads up slightly.

“She’s that Clown woman, right? The one in charge of that god-awful circus?” Vinson asked.

“I beg your pardon? It’s an enchanted Circus that travels the worlds and offers sanctuary to paranormal vagabonds in need,” Ignazio claimed half-heartedly. “And I might be able to pawn a few of you off on them if it comes to that, so be careful you don’t fall any further behind on your quotas. But you’re right; she is a Clown, with a capital C, and Clowns love candy. She’ll be attending my All Hallows’ Ball this year, and I don’t want her to feel excluded, so we’ll need some real top-shelf candy on offer.”

“Ah… we’re still waiting for the other shoe to drop here, boss,” Vinson confessed as most of us shared nervous glances with one another. “You want us to get candy? Fancy candy? I… I don’t get it. What’s the catch?”   

“Oh god, we’re not taking it from babies: we’re serving the babies with it!” Loewald balked in horror.

“No, but thank you for that highball to make the actual assignment seem more reasonable,” Ignazio said. “No, I’m sending you all down to the Taproots of the World Tree to collect some of the crystalized sap there.”

“The… The Taproots of the World Tree?” Vinson repeated softly. “The physical manifestation of the metaphysical network that binds all the worlds and planes of Creation, gnawed at by the Naught Things trying to break their way into reality? You’re sending us down there… for sweets?”

“Icky swears that Yggdrasil syrup pairs beautifully with French Toast,” he replied blithely. “This is an especially dangerous assignment, so I want you all to read that dossier in full. Emrys has been charting and forging new pathways through the planes from his spire in Adderwood, so thanks to him your trip down at least will be relatively easy.”

“Just… just there and back, right?” Vinson asked desperately, his voice wavering. “Just a handful of the stuff to wow Icky, and we’re done, right?”

A sadistic smirk slowly spread across Ignazio’s face before he told us how much crystalized sap we would need to retrieve.

\*\*\*

“You mine sixteen tons, what do you get? Another day older, and deeper in debt,” Loebald sang as he chipped away at the pulsing amber crystal emerging from the leviathan root.

The World Tree was cosmically colossal, though it’s meaningless to describe its size since I can only describe the parts of it that exist in three dimensions. The twin trunks of the tree snaked around each other like a double helix, each alight with an ever-shifting astral aura that perpetually waxed and waned in synchronicity with its twin. From its crown sprung a seemingly infinite mass of fractally dividing branches, shimmering with countless spherical ‘leaves’ which I knew to be individual universes. The base of the tree spawned an equally infinite mass of sprawling taproots, anchoring it in place and drawing precious sustenance from the edges of reality.  

As dangerous as it was to be there, it was nonetheless a sublime experience. You think that looking upon all of existence like that would fill you with Lovecraftian madness at your own insignificance, but it was far more transcendental than that. On some fundamental level, I recognized that tree. It was Yggdrasil. It was the Biblical tree of Good and Evil. It was the Two Trees of Valinor. That tree was meant to be there, and so was everything inside of it. Sure, it was functionally infinite and everything in it was finite, but the tree wasn’t merely massive; it was intricate. In the grand scheme of things, nothing inside of it was superfluous. Everything, no matter its scale, was part of the ultimate design of the tree. You and I may not be any more important than anyone or anything else, but if we weren’t important, we wouldn’t be here.

I’m not entirely sure if any of my coworkers felt the same way though.

“Saint Peter don’t you call me, ’cause I can’t go,” Loebald continued to sing, only to be interrupted by Vothstag’s irate howling, his eyes burning like coals as he dared him to finish the chorus.

Loebald bowed his head contritely as he awkwardly cleared his throat. When Vothstag was satisfied he had been cowed into silence, he turned around to resume his work.

“’Cause I owe my soul to the company store,” I finished for him, not too loudly, but loud enough that everyone heard me.

Vothstag immediately came charging at me, roaring in fury, but I didn’t flinch. I just let him chew me out for about a minute until I heard something that I was pretty sure was a question.

“That’s ridiculous. You’re making more noise than either of us,” I countered. “And wasting more time. Now if you don’t mind, I’ve got work to do.”

Vothstag sneered at me, but since I had resumed my task, his job as taskmaster was complete, and he left to attend to other matters.

“What the hell are you doing, pushing your luck like that, Brandon?” Vinson whispered.

“He was out of line. Even chain gangs are allowed to sing,” I explained. “Besides, I’m right, aren’t I? If we attract any unwanted attention, it will be because of him.”

“This isn’t the place to cause trouble!” he hissed. “Fill the carts as fast as you can so we can get out of here!”

When we arrived at the Taproots, we saw that we weren’t the first beings to try to mine this deposit of sap. Someone, likely some clan of Unseelie Fae, had established a fairly complex operation with rails and hand carts. As convenient as this was for us, it did of course pose the uncomfortable question of why the site had been completely abandoned when it was obviously far from depleted.

Me, Vinson, Loebald, and Klaus were chipping away at the crystal sap, tossing what we could into a nearby trolley cart. When it was full, Hamm and Gristle would haul it off so that Fish and Chips could scoop it into twenty-kilogram bags, which Hamm and Gristle would then stack and secure onto skids.

And as always, Vothstag supervised.

“Sixteen bleedin’ tons of this bilge,” Vinson muttered as he took a swing at it with his pickaxe. “And he’s got the nerve to tell us it’s just an appetizer for a party guest. What do you suppose they’re going to do with it all.”

“Refine it into proper syrup, I imagine,” Loewald replied. “Make it into sweets and sodas, or just drizzle some of it straight onto flapjacks. Either way, they’ll make a killing. Sixteen tons will probably sell for millions.”

“Why though? Is it just exotic sugar?” I asked.

“What do you think?” Loewald asked rhetorically, gesturing at the source. “For reality benders, anything from the edges of reality is potent stuff. They put a lump of this in their morning coffee, and the Veil will seem as weak to them as it is here. There’s no telling what havoc they’ll get up to, so you better hope we’re not around to see.”

“Now you’re just being ridiculous. Clowns don’t drink coffee,” Vinson joked.

I was about to ask him how he would know, when Vothstag put his hand on my shoulder and spun me around. Hamm and Gristle had returned with the empty cart, but only Gristle was getting ready to pull the full one. Vothstag spewed some of his usual gibberish, gesturing at me and then towards Hamm’s empty space at the cart.

“Because I sang one line? Seriously?” I asked. I was about to throw Loewald under the bus for singing in the first place, but Vothstag was already roaring incomprehensibly. “Alright, alright. I’ll pull the damn cart.”

I handed my pickaxe over to Hamm, who instantly began swinging at the sap with manic enthusiasm. Gristle gave me a slight nod of condolence before Vothstag yoked me up to the cart like an ox and then sent us on our way with an angry shout.

“If you don’t mind me asking, how come Hamm deserves a break and you don’t?” I asked Gristle as we made our way down the track, the dinging of our colleague’s pickaxes slowly fading into the background.

Gristle looked over his shoulder to confirm the Vothstag was well out of earshot, and then turned his head towards mine.

“Vinson’s wrong, you know,” he said in a soft, conspiratorial whisper.

“Ah… I’m story?” I asked.

“About Clowns and coffee,” he clarified. “Icky drinks coffee. I’ve seen her do it. She takes it with double cream and sugar to keep it Clown Kosher, of course. She’s a little too classy to indulge in stereotypical candy binges, but she’s still got a sweet tooth like the rest of us.”

“…Us?” I asked uneasily.

Gristle nodded, lifting up his gas mask by the filter and revealing his face to me for the first time. His poreless skin was a lustrous white, but his lips, nose, and the space around his eyes were all pitch black, and the eyes themselves sparkled with the light of a thousand dying stars. His mouth was spread into an unnaturally wide smile, revealing that his teeth were not only perfect but shiny to the point that I could see myself in them.

And I looked terrified.

“Loewald was right though, about what this stuff will do to us,” he went on. “Once everything’s fully loaded, Hamm and I are going to take a mouthful each and then take the whole haul for ourselves. We’ll stash some of it away somewhere safe, then use the rest to buy our way back into the Circus. The only problem is getting there. That’s where you come in.”

“What are you on about? How can I possibly help you get back to your Circus?” I asked.

“With that Seelie coin you got in your pocket,” he said, lowering his voice so that I only barely heard him. “These carts weren’t meant to be powered manually, you know. They run on Faerie magic, and that coin’s got enough that we can drive all sixteen tons of our loot to anywhere in the worlds we want.”

I briefly considered denying that I even had the coin, but if he was determined, he could find and take it easily enough, so there really wasn’t any point.

“Ignoring for the moment how you even know I have that, why not ask Vinson?” I suggested. “He’s got way more Seelie Silver than I do.”

“He doesn’t want out. You do,” Gristle responded. “You tried to escape once, and I know you’re just itching for a chance to try again.”

“But… Ignazio knows what you are, doesn’t he? He wouldn’t have let you around the sap if he wasn’t prepared for you to try to take some,” I said.

“He doesn’t know Hamm and I can take our masks off without his say-so,” Gristle explained. “We’ve been living off meagre rations of powdered milk to keep us in line, but we were able to get a hold of a bottle of the fresh stuff and chugged it before we came here. Ignazio and Vothstag have no power over us right now.”

“… I’m sorry, milk?” I asked confused.

“Not important at the moment. Are you in or not?” he asked.

I considered his proposition for a moment, deciding on one final question before answering.    

“Why not just take the coin from me?”

“Because I’m a nice guy,” he said with a sickeningly wide grin. “And… stealing Seelie Silver tends not to end well. I don’t need an answer now. The load’s not full yet. Think about it, and when the time comes, do whatever you’ve got to do.”

He pulled his mask back down, and we finished hauling the cart over to Fish and Chips in silence.

He wasn’t wrong about me wanting to escape, but my plan had always been to quietly sneak off and be long gone before anyone noticed. A fight between Vothstag and a pair of superpowered Clowns followed by a daring getaway on an Unseelie mining cart was a bit riskier than anything I had envisioned. But at the same time, this was an unprecedented opportunity that would likely never come again.  From the Taproots of the World Tree, I could go literally anywhere, and never have to worry about Ignazio or his minions tracking me down.

All it would cost me was the single coin I had to my name.

I hauled the cart with Gristle for the rest of the shift. Eventually, we had a train of sixteen pallets, each loaded with fifty twenty-kilogram sacks of crystalized sap.

“That’s it then. Order’s full,” Vinson declared as he walked the length of the train, testing the chains to make sure the cargo was fully secured. “All of you hop in the front and let’s get the hell out of here.”

Vothstag roared in disagreement, standing between us and the cart and making a vaguely groping gesture.

“Right, right. Contraband check,” Vinson nodded with a weary sigh as he outstretched his arms. “Nothing too invasive now, you hear? If this stuff was inside of us, you’d already know it.”

Vothstag didn’t acknowledge his comment, but proceeded to pat him down and empty his pockets.

Hamm and Gristle each gave me a knowing look. If I did nothing, Vothstag would find my coin and it would all be over for me anyway. I nodded my assent, and braced myself for the worse.

With a single swift motion, Hamm and Gristle each pulled their masks off, and the visages of the two monstrous Clowns were enough to throw all of us into immediate pandemonium. Hamm’s hair, eyes, lips and nose were all a fiery red, and I saw now that the tips of their ears had a pink tinge, just like their fingers. The instant their masks were off, they wasted no time shovelling a handful of crystal sap into their mouths.

Vothstag howled and charged straight at them, and everyone else scattered as quickly as they could to avoid being bulldozed by the massive deer man. Hamm and Gristle stood their ground, each of them grabbing ahold of one of his antlers. Despite his size and speed, Vothstag was brought to a dead stop.

He snorted and bellowed as he tried to force himself forward, but he was completely unable to overpower the two Clowns. Hamm and Gristle exchanged sinister smiles and began to spin Vothstag around and around. Within seconds his feet were off the ground, and with each rotation, he gained more and more momentum until his attackers finally let go of his antlers and sent him flying into the distance.

“The rest of you, stay out of our way!” Gristle shouted as he marched towards the front cart, grabbing me by the scruff of my jacket and pulling me along with him.

“Wait, why? Why can’t they come? Why can’t we all go?” I protested.

“We don’t know what half these freaks are and we don’t trust them,” he said as he tossed me onto the cart. “Now drive. Go straight until I say otherwise.”

I looked out at my confused and frightened companions, and took a bit of solace in the fact that they weren’t entirely certain if I had betrayed them or if I was just being kidnapped. I hesitated for a moment, but Hamm’s sharp talons digging into my shoulder were enough to press me into action.

With my coin of Seelie Silver clutched in my right palm, I grabbed a firm hold of the driving shaft and pushed the train forward. It accelerated at a remarkable pace, and before I knew it, we were speeding away from our work site and towards freedom.

“It’s working. It’s actually working,” Gristle laughed in relief.

“Even Vothstag can’t run this fast!” Hamm declared triumphantly. “The whole haul is ours! We’re rich! We’re free!”

I wanted to celebrate with them. I really did. But deep down inside I knew we weren’t out of the woods yet.

“You guys read that dossier Iggy gave us, right?” I asked. “The Naught Things that gnaw the Taproots are attracted to ontological anchors – anything that’s more real than its surroundings. If you guys are reality benders, and you just ate a massive power-up, doesn’t that make you the realest things here?”

“Isn’t that cute? He thinks he knows more about ontodynamics than us because he read a dossier,” Hamm scoffed.

“This isn’t our first time on the fringes of the unreal, boy!” Gristle replied. “You just drive this train, and let us worry about –”

Without warning, the Taproot split open ahead of us into a fuming, festering chasm. The ground quake was enough to completely derail the train, and I ducked and rolled while I had the chance.

When I came out of the roll, I looked up to see a titanic, disfigured, and disembodied head rising out of the chasm. The size and proportions of the entity fluctuated wildly, as if I was only looking at the three-dimensional facets of it like the World Tree itself. It was encrusted with some kind of dark barnacles, and anything that wasn’t its face was covered in thousands of squirming and feathery tentacles of every conceivable length. It had no nose, but several mouths which chanted backwards-sounding words in synchronicity with each other, dropping rotting black teeth every time they opened and closed. 

There were six randomly spaced and variously sized eyeballs darting around independently of each other, each glowing with a sickly yellow light. I was paralyzed in fear, terrified that the Naught Thing would see me, but all six of its eyes soon locked onto Hamm and Gristle.

As it slowly ascended upwards like a hot air balloon, a pair of flickering tongues shot out of two of its mouths with predatory intent. The Clowns were scooped up like flies, screaming as they were whisked back into the Naught Thing’s cavernous maws. I don’t know much about Clowns or what they’re capable of, only that Hamm and Gristle never got a chance to test their mettle against this behemoth. A few chomps of its black teeth, and it was all over.

I sat there in silence, watching as the Naught Thing continued to drift away, never daring to assume that it had forgotten about me.

“Brandon!” I heard a voice call from the distance.

I was finally able to pull my eyes off the Naught Thing, and when I looked down the track, I saw the rest of my crew hurrying towards me.

Which included a very angry Vothstag.

Grabbing me by the jacket and lifting me off the ground, he roared furiously in my face, demanding answers.

“Easy, Vothstag, easy!” Vinson insisted. “They just grabbed the kid. It wasn’t his idea.”

Vothstag growled skeptically, eyeing the toppled train beside us. He knew it could have only been driven like that by Seelie magic, and I still had my lucky coin clutched tightly in my right hand.

“…Hamm must have picked my pocket when he was working alongside us,” Vinson suggested.

I knew he didn’t really think that. He knew exactly how many coins he had, and he knew he wasn’t missing any. I don’t know why he covered for me, but I owe him big.

“Serves him right, too. Bloody idiot,” he said with a sad shake of his head as he surveyed the wreckage. “Let this be a lesson for all of you if you ever think about stealing my Seelie Silver! That’s right, Fish and Chips, I’m looking at you!”

Vothstag howled again, clearly unconvinced.

“They took me as a driver so that they could stay focused on defending the train!” I claimed. “If I hadn’t jumped when I did, they may have stood a chance against that giant floating head! I saved our haul!”

Vothstag snorted in contempt, but set me back on my feet. I don’t think he believed me, really, but he knew that Ignazio wouldn’t hold him blameless in this little debacle either, so it was in all of our best interests not to cast aspersions on one another’s stories.

“Listen up, everybody! We’re two men down and we’ve got to get this rig back on the track before some other unspeakable abomination comes along, so get moving!” Vinson ordered.

For once, Vothstag was doing most of the work, using his might to set the carts back on the tracks, while the rest of us just picked up any sacks of sap that had come loose.

“What a bloody joke,” Loewald grumbled as he threw a sack onto a cart. “Down from nine to seven, any of us could still die at any minute, and for what? We mined sixteen tons, and what do we get?”

“Another day older,” I agreed, throwing another sack next to his. “But some days, that’s enough.”",2,1729650237.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

To make matters worse, he spilled coffee all over himself and then blamed it on me! I was shocked and didn’t know how to react. I excused myself to the restroom to gather my thoughts, and by the time I returned, he was still fuming about the coffee spill. I decided to cut the date short and left.

1g9zs9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1g9zs9j/sixteen_tons/,Sixteen Tons,"“What’s got you in such a sour mood, Brandon? It’s payday!” my veteran colleague Vinson asked as the rusty freight elevator noisily rattled its way up towards the penthouse suite.

For the past year or two – I’m honestly not sure how long it’s been, actually – I’ve been under contract for an otherworldly masked Lord who calls himself Ignazio di Incognauta. He’s not a demon, exactly. He’s closer to Fae, I think, but I don’t fully understand what he is. I never sought him out. He came to me. I asked him how he even knew who I was, and he slapped me across the face for my insolence.

I still signed up though. That’s how desperate I was. He doesn’t waste his time offering deals to people who can say no.

He sends me and the rest of my crew out on what I can best describe as odd jobs. Half the time – hell, most of the time – I’m not even sure exactly what it is we’re doing. Most of the crew have been around longer than I have, and some of them aren’t human, but they all seem to have a better idea of what’s going on than me.

Our foreman Vothstag is technically the one in charge, but he’s not all there in the head; the top of his cranium’s been removed and a good chunk of his brain’s been scooped out. He mostly just barks guttural nonsense that none of us really understand, but somehow compels us to do what we’re supposed to, even when we don’t know what that is. He’s a hulking hunchback with an overgrown beard who usually wears an elk skull to cover up the hole in his head. If he was ever human, I don’t think he is now.

Vinson is our *de facto* leader, however, since he’s more or less a normal guy that we can relate to. Aside from Vothstag, he’s been working for Ignazio the longest. I won’t bother describing what he looks like, since the rest of us wear gas masks on duty. They’re partially to protect us from environmental and workplace hazards, partially to conceal our identities, but mainly to bring us more easily under Ignazio’s control.

That was why were all wearing our masks on the elevator, incidentally. We were on our way to see the big boss, and our contracts made it very clear we were never to remove our masks in his presence.  

“Come on, Vinson. You know meetings with Iggy never go well,” I replied bluntly.

“Oh, it’s just bluster. You know that. He’s got to put the fear of God into us,” Vinson claimed. “If he wasn’t actually satisfied with our performance, we wouldn’t still be here.”

“No, Brandon’s right. Iggy wouldn’t have called all ten of us in just to hand us our scrip and call us lazy arses,” Loewald chimed in.

“There’s nine of us, now,” Klaus reminded him grimly.

“Right, sorry. Hard to keep track some days,” Loewald admitted. “Regardless; something’s up, and the odds are pretty slim it will be something we like.”

I cringed as Vothstag shouted some of his garbled nonsense back towards Loewald.

“Yes, I know we’re not being paid to have fun, but –”

“We’re not being paid at all!” Klaus interrupted. “None of us are getting any real money until our contracts are up, and have any of you actually known anyone who made it to the end of their contract?” 

He recoiled as Vothstag spun around and began roaring at him, hot spittle flying out from beneath his mask of carved bone as he furiously waved his fist in his face.

“He’s right, Klaus. You’re being paranoid,” Vinson said in an eerily calm tone. “I’ve served out multiple contracts, and I’ve got the silver to prove it.”

He confidently reached into his pocket and held a troy-ounce coin of Seelie Silver between his fingers. Fish and Chips, the pair of three-foot-tall… *somethings* that work for us immediately crowded around him and began eyeing it greedily.

“That’s right boys, take a gander. That’s powerful magic right there, and you’ll get one of these for every moon you’ve worked at the end of your contracts,” he reminded us before quickly pocketing the coin away again. “Unless, of course, you do something to get your contract prematurely terminated; then you’ll have nothing to show for it but a fistful of expired scrip! So keep your heads down, mouths shut, and your eyes on the prize. You’ll have pockets jangling full of coins soon enough.”

As discreetly as I could, I slipped my hands into my pockets and rubbed my one Seelie coin for good luck. None of them knew I had it, because I didn’t want to explain how I got it, but that little bit of fortune it brought me had almost been enough to let me escape [once](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/comments/yzlz7s/dont_shop_at_the_isomart_after_dark/).

If I could just muster up the skill to make the best use of my luck, it would be enough to get me out for good one day.

The freight elevator finally came to a stop, and the doors creaked open to reveal the spacious and sumptuous penthouse of our employer. Portraits, animal heads, shields, weapons, and most of all masquerade masks covered nearly every square inch of the walls. Amidst the suits of armour and porcelain vases, there were dozens of priceless ornaments strewn throughout the room. They were incredibly tempting to steal, which was their whole point. Stealing from the boss was a violation of your contract, and you did not want to break your contract.  

The wide windows on the far wall offered a panoramic view of our decaying company town, nestled in a valley between sharp crimson mountains beneath a xanthous sky twinkling with a thousand black stars. You may have heard of such a place before, it has many names, but I will speak none of them here. 

Ignazio was sitting on a reclining couch in front of the fireplace, some paperwork left out on the coffee table and a featureless mask like a silver spiderweb clutched in his hand. Ignazio himself always wore the top half of a golden Oni mask, which in and of itself wasn’t unusual for our company, but the odd thing was that several portraits in the penthouse showed that it had once been a full mask.

I’ve always wondered what happened to the bottom half.  

Aside from that, Ignazio wasn’t too unusual looking. He was tall, skinny, and swarthy with a pronounced chin, tousled dark brown hair and always dressed in doublets of silk and velvet like he was performing Shakespeare or something.

Vothstag went into the room first, with Vinson almost, but not quite, at his side. Fish and Chips scamped after them, followed by Loewald, Klaus, and myself.

The last two members of our crew are called Hamm and Gristle, and they’re the two I know the least about. They keep to themselves, and I don’t think I’ve ever even seen them with their masks off. I have seen them without gloves on though, and both of their hands are white with pink-tinged fingers. I have no idea what that means, but for some reason, I always found it oddly unsettling.

The only thing I know for sure about them is that they’re the only survivors of another crew that tried to run out on their contract, and I know better than to ask for details about that.

“Gentlemen, Gentlemen, right on time,” Ignazio greeted us as he waved us over. He positioned himself on his couch to make it impossible for any of us to sit beside him, and none of us dared to take a seat at any of the clawfooted armchairs that were meant for guests with much higher stations in life. “I’ve got this moon’s scrip books all stamped and approved. You’ll notice they’re a bit light, seeing as how you were slightly behind quota on this assignment.”

None of us objected, and none of us were particularly surprised. I was grateful that the mask hid my expression, and I’m sure I wasn’t the only one. I still had to make an effort to mind my body language though. Being so accustomed to his employees and compatriots wearing masks, Ignazio was quite astute to body language.

Vinson accepted the stack of nine booklets and nodded gratefully.

“We appreciate your leniency, my lord, and look forward to earning back our privileges on our next assignment,” he said.

“I was hoping you’d say that,” Ignazio grinned as he took a sip from his crystal chalice. He set it down on the coffee table and picked up a dossier. “Halloween is fast approaching, and that means we need costumes and candy. Costumes we have in abundance, obviously, but candy’s one vice I don’t usually keep well stocked.”

“So we’re actually stealing candy from babies on our next job?” Klaus asked.

“Nothing so quotidian,” Ignazio sneered. “Remind me; have any of you met Icky before?”

The name meant nothing to me, but I glanced from side to side to see if anyone else reacted to it. I could have sworn I saw Hamm and Gristle perk their heads up slightly.

“She’s that Clown woman, right? The one in charge of that god-awful circus?” Vinson asked.

“I beg your pardon? It’s an enchanted Circus that travels the worlds and offers sanctuary to paranormal vagabonds in need,” Ignazio claimed half-heartedly. “And I might be able to pawn a few of you off on them if it comes to that, so be careful you don’t fall any further behind on your quotas. But you’re right; she is a Clown, with a capital C, and Clowns love candy. She’ll be attending my All Hallows’ Ball this year, and I don’t want her to feel excluded, so we’ll need some real top-shelf candy on offer.”

“Ah… we’re still waiting for the other shoe to drop here, boss,” Vinson confessed as most of us shared nervous glances with one another. “You want us to get candy? Fancy candy? I… I don’t get it. What’s the catch?”   

“Oh god, we’re not taking it from babies: we’re serving the babies with it!” Loewald balked in horror.

“No, but thank you for that highball to make the actual assignment seem more reasonable,” Ignazio said. “No, I’m sending you all down to the Taproots of the World Tree to collect some of the crystalized sap there.”

“The… The Taproots of the World Tree?” Vinson repeated softly. “The physical manifestation of the metaphysical network that binds all the worlds and planes of Creation, gnawed at by the Naught Things trying to break their way into reality? You’re sending us down there… for sweets?”

“Icky swears that Yggdrasil syrup pairs beautifully with French Toast,” he replied blithely. “This is an especially dangerous assignment, so I want you all to read that dossier in full. Emrys has been charting and forging new pathways through the planes from his spire in Adderwood, so thanks to him your trip down at least will be relatively easy.”

“Just… just there and back, right?” Vinson asked desperately, his voice wavering. “Just a handful of the stuff to wow Icky, and we’re done, right?”

A sadistic smirk slowly spread across Ignazio’s face before he told us how much crystalized sap we would need to retrieve.

\*\*\*

“You mine sixteen tons, what do you get? Another day older, and deeper in debt,” Loebald sang as he chipped away at the pulsing amber crystal emerging from the leviathan root.

The World Tree was cosmically colossal, though it’s meaningless to describe its size since I can only describe the parts of it that exist in three dimensions. The twin trunks of the tree snaked around each other like a double helix, each alight with an ever-shifting astral aura that perpetually waxed and waned in synchronicity with its twin. From its crown sprung a seemingly infinite mass of fractally dividing branches, shimmering with countless spherical ‘leaves’ which I knew to be individual universes. The base of the tree spawned an equally infinite mass of sprawling taproots, anchoring it in place and drawing precious sustenance from the edges of reality.  

As dangerous as it was to be there, it was nonetheless a sublime experience. You think that looking upon all of existence like that would fill you with Lovecraftian madness at your own insignificance, but it was far more transcendental than that. On some fundamental level, I recognized that tree. It was Yggdrasil. It was the Biblical tree of Good and Evil. It was the Two Trees of Valinor. That tree was meant to be there, and so was everything inside of it. Sure, it was functionally infinite and everything in it was finite, but the tree wasn’t merely massive; it was intricate. In the grand scheme of things, nothing inside of it was superfluous. Everything, no matter its scale, was part of the ultimate design of the tree. You and I may not be any more important than anyone or anything else, but if we weren’t important, we wouldn’t be here.

I’m not entirely sure if any of my coworkers felt the same way though.

“Saint Peter don’t you call me, ’cause I can’t go,” Loebald continued to sing, only to be interrupted by Vothstag’s irate howling, his eyes burning like coals as he dared him to finish the chorus.

Loebald bowed his head contritely as he awkwardly cleared his throat. When Vothstag was satisfied he had been cowed into silence, he turned around to resume his work.

“’Cause I owe my soul to the company store,” I finished for him, not too loudly, but loud enough that everyone heard me.

Vothstag immediately came charging at me, roaring in fury, but I didn’t flinch. I just let him chew me out for about a minute until I heard something that I was pretty sure was a question.

“That’s ridiculous. You’re making more noise than either of us,” I countered. “And wasting more time. Now if you don’t mind, I’ve got work to do.”

Vothstag sneered at me, but since I had resumed my task, his job as taskmaster was complete, and he left to attend to other matters.

“What the hell are you doing, pushing your luck like that, Brandon?” Vinson whispered.

“He was out of line. Even chain gangs are allowed to sing,” I explained. “Besides, I’m right, aren’t I? If we attract any unwanted attention, it will be because of him.”

“This isn’t the place to cause trouble!” he hissed. “Fill the carts as fast as you can so we can get out of here!”

When we arrived at the Taproots, we saw that we weren’t the first beings to try to mine this deposit of sap. Someone, likely some clan of Unseelie Fae, had established a fairly complex operation with rails and hand carts. As convenient as this was for us, it did of course pose the uncomfortable question of why the site had been completely abandoned when it was obviously far from depleted.

Me, Vinson, Loebald, and Klaus were chipping away at the crystal sap, tossing what we could into a nearby trolley cart. When it was full, Hamm and Gristle would haul it off so that Fish and Chips could scoop it into twenty-kilogram bags, which Hamm and Gristle would then stack and secure onto skids.

And as always, Vothstag supervised.

“Sixteen bleedin’ tons of this bilge,” Vinson muttered as he took a swing at it with his pickaxe. “And he’s got the nerve to tell us it’s just an appetizer for a party guest. What do you suppose they’re going to do with it all.”

“Refine it into proper syrup, I imagine,” Loewald replied. “Make it into sweets and sodas, or just drizzle some of it straight onto flapjacks. Either way, they’ll make a killing. Sixteen tons will probably sell for millions.”

“Why though? Is it just exotic sugar?” I asked.

“What do you think?” Loewald asked rhetorically, gesturing at the source. “For reality benders, anything from the edges of reality is potent stuff. They put a lump of this in their morning coffee, and the Veil will seem as weak to them as it is here. There’s no telling what havoc they’ll get up to, so you better hope we’re not around to see.”

“Now you’re just being ridiculous. Clowns don’t drink coffee,” Vinson joked.

I was about to ask him how he would know, when Vothstag put his hand on my shoulder and spun me around. Hamm and Gristle had returned with the empty cart, but only Gristle was getting ready to pull the full one. Vothstag spewed some of his usual gibberish, gesturing at me and then towards Hamm’s empty space at the cart.

“Because I sang one line? Seriously?” I asked. I was about to throw Loewald under the bus for singing in the first place, but Vothstag was already roaring incomprehensibly. “Alright, alright. I’ll pull the damn cart.”

I handed my pickaxe over to Hamm, who instantly began swinging at the sap with manic enthusiasm. Gristle gave me a slight nod of condolence before Vothstag yoked me up to the cart like an ox and then sent us on our way with an angry shout.

“If you don’t mind me asking, how come Hamm deserves a break and you don’t?” I asked Gristle as we made our way down the track, the dinging of our colleague’s pickaxes slowly fading into the background.

Gristle looked over his shoulder to confirm the Vothstag was well out of earshot, and then turned his head towards mine.

“Vinson’s wrong, you know,” he said in a soft, conspiratorial whisper.

“Ah… I’m story?” I asked.

“About Clowns and coffee,” he clarified. “Icky drinks coffee. I’ve seen her do it. She takes it with double cream and sugar to keep it Clown Kosher, of course. She’s a little too classy to indulge in stereotypical candy binges, but she’s still got a sweet tooth like the rest of us.”

“…Us?” I asked uneasily.

Gristle nodded, lifting up his gas mask by the filter and revealing his face to me for the first time. His poreless skin was a lustrous white, but his lips, nose, and the space around his eyes were all pitch black, and the eyes themselves sparkled with the light of a thousand dying stars. His mouth was spread into an unnaturally wide smile, revealing that his teeth were not only perfect but shiny to the point that I could see myself in them.

And I looked terrified.

“Loewald was right though, about what this stuff will do to us,” he went on. “Once everything’s fully loaded, Hamm and I are going to take a mouthful each and then take the whole haul for ourselves. We’ll stash some of it away somewhere safe, then use the rest to buy our way back into the Circus. The only problem is getting there. That’s where you come in.”

“What are you on about? How can I possibly help you get back to your Circus?” I asked.

“With that Seelie coin you got in your pocket,” he said, lowering his voice so that I only barely heard him. “These carts weren’t meant to be powered manually, you know. They run on Faerie magic, and that coin’s got enough that we can drive all sixteen tons of our loot to anywhere in the worlds we want.”

I briefly considered denying that I even had the coin, but if he was determined, he could find and take it easily enough, so there really wasn’t any point.

“Ignoring for the moment how you even know I have that, why not ask Vinson?” I suggested. “He’s got way more Seelie Silver than I do.”

“He doesn’t want out. You do,” Gristle responded. “You tried to escape once, and I know you’re just itching for a chance to try again.”

“But… Ignazio knows what you are, doesn’t he? He wouldn’t have let you around the sap if he wasn’t prepared for you to try to take some,” I said.

“He doesn’t know Hamm and I can take our masks off without his say-so,” Gristle explained. “We’ve been living off meagre rations of powdered milk to keep us in line, but we were able to get a hold of a bottle of the fresh stuff and chugged it before we came here. Ignazio and Vothstag have no power over us right now.”

“… I’m sorry, milk?” I asked confused.

“Not important at the moment. Are you in or not?” he asked.

I considered his proposition for a moment, deciding on one final question before answering.    

“Why not just take the coin from me?”

“Because I’m a nice guy,” he said with a sickeningly wide grin. “And… stealing Seelie Silver tends not to end well. I don’t need an answer now. The load’s not full yet. Think about it, and when the time comes, do whatever you’ve got to do.”

He pulled his mask back down, and we finished hauling the cart over to Fish and Chips in silence.

He wasn’t wrong about me wanting to escape, but my plan had always been to quietly sneak off and be long gone before anyone noticed. A fight between Vothstag and a pair of superpowered Clowns followed by a daring getaway on an Unseelie mining cart was a bit riskier than anything I had envisioned. But at the same time, this was an unprecedented opportunity that would likely never come again.  From the Taproots of the World Tree, I could go literally anywhere, and never have to worry about Ignazio or his minions tracking me down.

All it would cost me was the single coin I had to my name.

I hauled the cart with Gristle for the rest of the shift. Eventually, we had a train of sixteen pallets, each loaded with fifty twenty-kilogram sacks of crystalized sap.

“That’s it then. Order’s full,” Vinson declared as he walked the length of the train, testing the chains to make sure the cargo was fully secured. “All of you hop in the front and let’s get the hell out of here.”

Vothstag roared in disagreement, standing between us and the cart and making a vaguely groping gesture.

“Right, right. Contraband check,” Vinson nodded with a weary sigh as he outstretched his arms. “Nothing too invasive now, you hear? If this stuff was inside of us, you’d already know it.”

Vothstag didn’t acknowledge his comment, but proceeded to pat him down and empty his pockets.

Hamm and Gristle each gave me a knowing look. If I did nothing, Vothstag would find my coin and it would all be over for me anyway. I nodded my assent, and braced myself for the worse.

With a single swift motion, Hamm and Gristle each pulled their masks off, and the visages of the two monstrous Clowns were enough to throw all of us into immediate pandemonium. Hamm’s hair, eyes, lips and nose were all a fiery red, and I saw now that the tips of their ears had a pink tinge, just like their fingers. The instant their masks were off, they wasted no time shovelling a handful of crystal sap into their mouths.

Vothstag howled and charged straight at them, and everyone else scattered as quickly as they could to avoid being bulldozed by the massive deer man. Hamm and Gristle stood their ground, each of them grabbing ahold of one of his antlers. Despite his size and speed, Vothstag was brought to a dead stop.

He snorted and bellowed as he tried to force himself forward, but he was completely unable to overpower the two Clowns. Hamm and Gristle exchanged sinister smiles and began to spin Vothstag around and around. Within seconds his feet were off the ground, and with each rotation, he gained more and more momentum until his attackers finally let go of his antlers and sent him flying into the distance.

“The rest of you, stay out of our way!” Gristle shouted as he marched towards the front cart, grabbing me by the scruff of my jacket and pulling me along with him.

“Wait, why? Why can’t they come? Why can’t we all go?” I protested.

“We don’t know what half these freaks are and we don’t trust them,” he said as he tossed me onto the cart. “Now drive. Go straight until I say otherwise.”

I looked out at my confused and frightened companions, and took a bit of solace in the fact that they weren’t entirely certain if I had betrayed them or if I was just being kidnapped. I hesitated for a moment, but Hamm’s sharp talons digging into my shoulder were enough to press me into action.

With my coin of Seelie Silver clutched in my right palm, I grabbed a firm hold of the driving shaft and pushed the train forward. It accelerated at a remarkable pace, and before I knew it, we were speeding away from our work site and towards freedom.

“It’s working. It’s actually working,” Gristle laughed in relief.

“Even Vothstag can’t run this fast!” Hamm declared triumphantly. “The whole haul is ours! We’re rich! We’re free!”

I wanted to celebrate with them. I really did. But deep down inside I knew we weren’t out of the woods yet.

“You guys read that dossier Iggy gave us, right?” I asked. “The Naught Things that gnaw the Taproots are attracted to ontological anchors – anything that’s more real than its surroundings. If you guys are reality benders, and you just ate a massive power-up, doesn’t that make you the realest things here?”

“Isn’t that cute? He thinks he knows more about ontodynamics than us because he read a dossier,” Hamm scoffed.

“This isn’t our first time on the fringes of the unreal, boy!” Gristle replied. “You just drive this train, and let us worry about –”

Without warning, the Taproot split open ahead of us into a fuming, festering chasm. The ground quake was enough to completely derail the train, and I ducked and rolled while I had the chance.

When I came out of the roll, I looked up to see a titanic, disfigured, and disembodied head rising out of the chasm. The size and proportions of the entity fluctuated wildly, as if I was only looking at the three-dimensional facets of it like the World Tree itself. It was encrusted with some kind of dark barnacles, and anything that wasn’t its face was covered in thousands of squirming and feathery tentacles of every conceivable length. It had no nose, but several mouths which chanted backwards-sounding words in synchronicity with each other, dropping rotting black teeth every time they opened and closed. 

There were six randomly spaced and variously sized eyeballs darting around independently of each other, each glowing with a sickly yellow light. I was paralyzed in fear, terrified that the Naught Thing would see me, but all six of its eyes soon locked onto Hamm and Gristle.

As it slowly ascended upwards like a hot air balloon, a pair of flickering tongues shot out of two of its mouths with predatory intent. The Clowns were scooped up like flies, screaming as they were whisked back into the Naught Thing’s cavernous maws. I don’t know much about Clowns or what they’re capable of, only that Hamm and Gristle never got a chance to test their mettle against this behemoth. A few chomps of its black teeth, and it was all over.

I sat there in silence, watching as the Naught Thing continued to drift away, never daring to assume that it had forgotten about me.

“Brandon!” I heard a voice call from the distance.

I was finally able to pull my eyes off the Naught Thing, and when I looked down the track, I saw the rest of my crew hurrying towards me.

Which included a very angry Vothstag.

Grabbing me by the jacket and lifting me off the ground, he roared furiously in my face, demanding answers.

“Easy, Vothstag, easy!” Vinson insisted. “They just grabbed the kid. It wasn’t his idea.”

Vothstag growled skeptically, eyeing the toppled train beside us. He knew it could have only been driven like that by Seelie magic, and I still had my lucky coin clutched tightly in my right hand.

“…Hamm must have picked my pocket when he was working alongside us,” Vinson suggested.

I knew he didn’t really think that. He knew exactly how many coins he had, and he knew he wasn’t missing any. I don’t know why he covered for me, but I owe him big.

“Serves him right, too. Bloody idiot,” he said with a sad shake of his head as he surveyed the wreckage. “Let this be a lesson for all of you if you ever think about stealing my Seelie Silver! That’s right, Fish and Chips, I’m looking at you!”

Vothstag howled again, clearly unconvinced.

“They took me as a driver so that they could stay focused on defending the train!” I claimed. “If I hadn’t jumped when I did, they may have stood a chance against that giant floating head! I saved our haul!”

Vothstag snorted in contempt, but set me back on my feet. I don’t think he believed me, really, but he knew that Ignazio wouldn’t hold him blameless in this little debacle either, so it was in all of our best interests not to cast aspersions on one another’s stories.

“Listen up, everybody! We’re two men down and we’ve got to get this rig back on the track before some other unspeakable abomination comes along, so get moving!” Vinson ordered.

For once, Vothstag was doing most of the work, using his might to set the carts back on the tracks, while the rest of us just picked up any sacks of sap that had come loose.

“What a bloody joke,” Loewald grumbled as he threw a sack onto a cart. “Down from nine to seven, any of us could still die at any minute, and for what? We mined sixteen tons, and what do we get?”

“Another day older,” I agreed, throwing another sack next to his. “But some days, that’s enough.”",5,1729650098.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False
1g9zs4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/1g9zs4r/it_finally_happened_to_me_after_two_years/,It finally happened to me after two years ,"Hello everyone, please excuse my bad English, it’s not my mother language. 

First of all I would like to thank everyone in this subreddit for sharing their experience with us, it’s been really helpful. 

My boyfriend and I have been both struggling financially due to some legal and inheritance issues, we have been suffering for two years, we couldn’t even go on coffee dates or pay for the electricity, our accounts got frozen due to some issues with the death of family members (I can’t give more details I wouldn’t want him to see this), specially during this last 8 months, our mental health was at rock bottom, every one of us has to remind the other to not delete our self. 

I for myself I’m huge believer in the law of attraction, since 2016 when I was a teenager and found the movie the secret, it changed my life, I’ve literally been able to manifest the impossible, I got a great internship in the beginning of the pandemic without even applying for my first year in college abroad, and I got another one that paid for my degree the second year, my technique was to always visualise what I wanted and I would get it whithing the week, the last to years of my life I lost both of my parents, so it really messed me up, I couldn’t even get out of bed let alone find a job, I spent all my savings, and my boyfriend lost his company and got his accounts frozen because his business partner ran out of the country without paying the taxes of a very large sum. 

I’ve been trying every manifestation technique that I’ve came across these last years and nothing was working, it even got worse with every time I got a little bit of hope, till this Sunday it got to a point where I couldn’t take it anymore, I started crying, everything came up, the grief of both my parents, everything that I lost, the way my relationship was going, literally everything, I just started saying that I don’t want anything anymore, I don’t care about anything anymore, I’m just going to wait for the grim reaper in my room till my day comes, this morning my boyfriend called me to tell me that his lawyer called him, and that the issue with the taxes is sorted out, he still owes money but his accounts got unfrozen because the state has allowed him to get back to work for his to pay in instalments his part of the taxes that he owes, and that he can take a loan from the bank and get me a job inside of his company with the conditions that I want such as remote work because he knows that I’m to depressed to get out of the house, it’s been literally two years of us struggling financially but mostly mentally, we couldn’t do anything, we have not seen each other for 3 months and know we have already set a date for a civil ceremony to get married before the end of 2024. 

I know that it’s not a post that’s gonna excite everyone but I just wanted to share this with anyone that’s also struggling mentally because of how things are bad right now, and also I wanted to thank each and everyone whom I’ve had the pleasure to read these past months for giving me a moment of joy by sharing their stories ",14,1729650085.0,lawofattraction,2,1.0,False
1g9zra6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g9zra6/sixteen_tons/,Sixteen Tons,"“What’s got you in such a sour mood, Brandon? It’s payday!” my veteran colleague Vinson asked as the rusty freight elevator noisily rattled its way up towards the penthouse suite.

For the past year or two – I’m honestly not sure how long it’s been, actually – I’ve been under contract for an otherworldly masked Lord who calls himself Ignazio di Incognauta. He’s not a demon, exactly. He’s closer to Fae, I think, but I don’t fully understand what he is. I never sought him out. He came to me. I asked him how he even knew who I was, and he slapped me across the face for my insolence.

I still signed up though. That’s how desperate I was. He doesn’t waste his time offering deals to people who can say no.

He sends me and the rest of my crew out on what I can best describe as odd jobs. Half the time – hell, most of the time – I’m not even sure exactly what it is we’re doing. Most of the crew have been around longer than I have, and some of them aren’t human, but they all seem to have a better idea of what’s going on than me.

Our foreman Vothstag is technically the one in charge, but he’s not all there in the head; the top of his cranium’s been removed and a good chunk of his brain’s been scooped out. He mostly just barks guttural nonsense that none of us really understand, but somehow compels us to do what we’re supposed to, even when we don’t know what that is. He’s a hulking hunchback with an overgrown beard who usually wears an elk skull to cover up the hole in his head. If he was ever human, I don’t think he is now.

Vinson is our *de facto* leader, however, since he’s more or less a normal guy that we can relate to. Aside from Vothstag, he’s been working for Ignazio the longest. I won’t bother describing what he looks like, since the rest of us wear gas masks on duty. They’re partially to protect us from environmental and workplace hazards, partially to conceal our identities, but mainly to bring us more easily under Ignazio’s control.

That was why were all wearing our masks on the elevator, incidentally. We were on our way to see the big boss, and our contracts made it very clear we were never to remove our masks in his presence.  

“Come on, Vinson. You know meetings with Iggy never go well,” I replied bluntly.

“Oh, it’s just bluster. You know that. He’s got to put the fear of God into us,” Vinson claimed. “If he wasn’t actually satisfied with our performance, we wouldn’t still be here.”

“No, Brandon’s right. Iggy wouldn’t have called all ten of us in just to hand us our scrip and call us lazy arses,” Loewald chimed in.

“There’s nine of us, now,” Klaus reminded him grimly.

“Right, sorry. Hard to keep track some days,” Loewald admitted. “Regardless; something’s up, and the odds are pretty slim it will be something we like.”

I cringed as Vothstag shouted some of his garbled nonsense back towards Loewald.

“Yes, I know we’re not being paid to have fun, but –”

“We’re not being paid at all!” Klaus interrupted. “None of us are getting any real money until our contracts are up, and have any of you actually known anyone who made it to the end of their contract?” 

He recoiled as Vothstag spun around and began roaring at him, hot spittle flying out from beneath his mask of carved bone as he furiously waved his fist in his face.

“He’s right, Klaus. You’re being paranoid,” Vinson said in an eerily calm tone. “I’ve served out multiple contracts, and I’ve got the silver to prove it.”

He confidently reached into his pocket and held a troy-ounce coin of Seelie Silver between his fingers. Fish and Chips, the pair of three-foot-tall… *somethings* that work for us immediately crowded around him and began eyeing it greedily.

“That’s right boys, take a gander. That’s powerful magic right there, and you’ll get one of these for every moon you’ve worked at the end of your contracts,” he reminded us before quickly pocketing the coin away again. “Unless, of course, you do something to get your contract prematurely terminated; then you’ll have nothing to show for it but a fistful of expired scrip! So keep your heads down, mouths shut, and your eyes on the prize. You’ll have pockets jangling full of coins soon enough.”

As discreetly as I could, I slipped my hands into my pockets and rubbed my one Seelie coin for good luck. None of them knew I had it, because I didn’t want to explain how I got it, but that little bit of fortune it brought me had almost been enough to let me escape [once](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/comments/yzlz7s/dont_shop_at_the_isomart_after_dark/).

If I could just muster up the skill to make the best use of my luck, it would be enough to get me out for good one day.

The freight elevator finally came to a stop, and the doors creaked open to reveal the spacious and sumptuous penthouse of our employer. Portraits, animal heads, shields, weapons, and most of all masquerade masks covered nearly every square inch of the walls. Amidst the suits of armour and porcelain vases, there were dozens of priceless ornaments strewn throughout the room. They were incredibly tempting to steal, which was their whole point. Stealing from the boss was a violation of your contract, and you did not want to break your contract.  

The wide windows on the far wall offered a panoramic view of our decaying company town, nestled in a valley between sharp crimson mountains beneath a xanthous sky twinkling with a thousand black stars. You may have heard of such a place before, it has many names, but I will speak none of them here. 

Ignazio was sitting on a reclining couch in front of the fireplace, some paperwork left out on the coffee table and a featureless mask like a silver spiderweb clutched in his hand. Ignazio himself always wore the top half of a golden Oni mask, which in and of itself wasn’t unusual for our company, but the odd thing was that several portraits in the penthouse showed that it had once been a full mask.

I’ve always wondered what happened to the bottom half.  

Aside from that, Ignazio wasn’t too unusual looking. He was tall, skinny, and swarthy with a pronounced chin, tousled dark brown hair and always dressed in doublets of silk and velvet like he was performing Shakespeare or something.

Vothstag went into the room first, with Vinson almost, but not quite, at his side. Fish and Chips scamped after them, followed by Loewald, Klaus, and myself.

The last two members of our crew are called Hamm and Gristle, and they’re the two I know the least about. They keep to themselves, and I don’t think I’ve ever even seen them with their masks off. I have seen them without gloves on though, and both of their hands are white with pink-tinged fingers. I have no idea what that means, but for some reason, I always found it oddly unsettling.

The only thing I know for sure about them is that they’re the only survivors of another crew that tried to run out on their contract, and I know better than to ask for details about that.

“Gentlemen, Gentlemen, right on time,” Ignazio greeted us as he waved us over. He positioned himself on his couch to make it impossible for any of us to sit beside him, and none of us dared to take a seat at any of the clawfooted armchairs that were meant for guests with much higher stations in life. “I’ve got this moon’s scrip books all stamped and approved. You’ll notice they’re a bit light, seeing as how you were slightly behind quota on this assignment.”

None of us objected, and none of us were particularly surprised. I was grateful that the mask hid my expression, and I’m sure I wasn’t the only one. I still had to make an effort to mind my body language though. Being so accustomed to his employees and compatriots wearing masks, Ignazio was quite astute to body language.

Vinson accepted the stack of nine booklets and nodded gratefully.

“We appreciate your leniency, my lord, and look forward to earning back our privileges on our next assignment,” he said.

“I was hoping you’d say that,” Ignazio grinned as he took a sip from his crystal chalice. He set it down on the coffee table and picked up a dossier. “Halloween is fast approaching, and that means we need costumes and candy. Costumes we have in abundance, obviously, but candy’s one vice I don’t usually keep well stocked.”

“So we’re actually stealing candy from babies on our next job?” Klaus asked.

“Nothing so quotidian,” Ignazio sneered. “Remind me; have any of you met Icky before?”

The name meant nothing to me, but I glanced from side to side to see if anyone else reacted to it. I could have sworn I saw Hamm and Gristle perk their heads up slightly.

“She’s that Clown woman, right? The one in charge of that god-awful circus?” Vinson asked.

“I beg your pardon? It’s an enchanted Circus that travels the worlds and offers sanctuary to paranormal vagabonds in need,” Ignazio claimed half-heartedly. “And I might be able to pawn a few of you off on them if it comes to that, so be careful you don’t fall any further behind on your quotas. But you’re right; she is a Clown, with a capital C, and Clowns love candy. She’ll be attending my All Hallows’ Ball this year, and I don’t want her to feel excluded, so we’ll need some real top-shelf candy on offer.”

“Ah… we’re still waiting for the other shoe to drop here, boss,” Vinson confessed as most of us shared nervous glances with one another. “You want us to get candy? Fancy candy? I… I don’t get it. What’s the catch?”   

“Oh god, we’re not taking it from babies: we’re serving the babies with it!” Loewald balked in horror.

“No, but thank you for that highball to make the actual assignment seem more reasonable,” Ignazio said. “No, I’m sending you all down to the Taproots of the World Tree to collect some of the crystalized sap there.”

“The… The Taproots of the World Tree?” Vinson repeated softly. “The physical manifestation of the metaphysical network that binds all the worlds and planes of Creation, gnawed at by the Naught Things trying to break their way into reality? You’re sending us down there… for sweets?”

“Icky swears that Yggdrasil syrup pairs beautifully with French Toast,” he replied blithely. “This is an especially dangerous assignment, so I want you all to read that dossier in full. Emrys has been charting and forging new pathways through the planes from his spire in Adderwood, so thanks to him your trip down at least will be relatively easy.”

“Just… just there and back, right?” Vinson asked desperately, his voice wavering. “Just a handful of the stuff to wow Icky, and we’re done, right?”

A sadistic smirk slowly spread across Ignazio’s face before he told us how much crystalized sap we would need to retrieve.

\*\*\*

“You mine sixteen tons, what do you get? Another day older, and deeper in debt,” Loebald sang as he chipped away at the pulsing amber crystal emerging from the leviathan root.

The World Tree was cosmically colossal, though it’s meaningless to describe its size since I can only describe the parts of it that exist in three dimensions. The twin trunks of the tree snaked around each other like a double helix, each alight with an ever-shifting astral aura that perpetually waxed and waned in synchronicity with its twin. From its crown sprung a seemingly infinite mass of fractally dividing branches, shimmering with countless spherical ‘leaves’ which I knew to be individual universes. The base of the tree spawned an equally infinite mass of sprawling taproots, anchoring it in place and drawing precious sustenance from the edges of reality.  

As dangerous as it was to be there, it was nonetheless a sublime experience. You think that looking upon all of existence like that would fill you with Lovecraftian madness at your own insignificance, but it was far more transcendental than that. On some fundamental level, I recognized that tree. It was Yggdrasil. It was the Biblical tree of Good and Evil. It was the Two Trees of Valinor. That tree was meant to be there, and so was everything inside of it. Sure, it was functionally infinite and everything in it was finite, but the tree wasn’t merely massive; it was intricate. In the grand scheme of things, nothing inside of it was superfluous. Everything, no matter its scale, was part of the ultimate design of the tree. You and I may not be any more important than anyone or anything else, but if we weren’t important, we wouldn’t be here.

I’m not entirely sure if any of my coworkers felt the same way though.

“Saint Peter don’t you call me, ’cause I can’t go,” Loebald continued to sing, only to be interrupted by Vothstag’s irate howling, his eyes burning like coals as he dared him to finish the chorus.

Loebald bowed his head contritely as he awkwardly cleared his throat. When Vothstag was satisfied he had been cowed into silence, he turned around to resume his work.

“’Cause I owe my soul to the company store,” I finished for him, not too loudly, but loud enough that everyone heard me.

Vothstag immediately came charging at me, roaring in fury, but I didn’t flinch. I just let him chew me out for about a minute until I heard something that I was pretty sure was a question.

“That’s ridiculous. You’re making more noise than either of us,” I countered. “And wasting more time. Now if you don’t mind, I’ve got work to do.”

Vothstag sneered at me, but since I had resumed my task, his job as taskmaster was complete, and he left to attend to other matters.

“What the hell are you doing, pushing your luck like that, Brandon?” Vinson whispered.

“He was out of line. Even chain gangs are allowed to sing,” I explained. “Besides, I’m right, aren’t I? If we attract any unwanted attention, it will be because of him.”

“This isn’t the place to cause trouble!” he hissed. “Fill the carts as fast as you can so we can get out of here!”

When we arrived at the Taproots, we saw that we weren’t the first beings to try to mine this deposit of sap. Someone, likely some clan of Unseelie Fae, had established a fairly complex operation with rails and hand carts. As convenient as this was for us, it did of course pose the uncomfortable question of why the site had been completely abandoned when it was obviously far from depleted.

Me, Vinson, Loebald, and Klaus were chipping away at the crystal sap, tossing what we could into a nearby trolley cart. When it was full, Hamm and Gristle would haul it off so that Fish and Chips could scoop it into twenty-kilogram bags, which Hamm and Gristle would then stack and secure onto skids.

And as always, Vothstag supervised.

“Sixteen bleedin’ tons of this bilge,” Vinson muttered as he took a swing at it with his pickaxe. “And he’s got the nerve to tell us it’s just an appetizer for a party guest. What do you suppose they’re going to do with it all.”

“Refine it into proper syrup, I imagine,” Loewald replied. “Make it into sweets and sodas, or just drizzle some of it straight onto flapjacks. Either way, they’ll make a killing. Sixteen tons will probably sell for millions.”

“Why though? Is it just exotic sugar?” I asked.

“What do you think?” Loewald asked rhetorically, gesturing at the source. “For reality benders, anything from the edges of reality is potent stuff. They put a lump of this in their morning coffee, and the Veil will seem as weak to them as it is here. There’s no telling what havoc they’ll get up to, so you better hope we’re not around to see.”

“Now you’re just being ridiculous. Clowns don’t drink coffee,” Vinson joked.

I was about to ask him how he would know, when Vothstag put his hand on my shoulder and spun me around. Hamm and Gristle had returned with the empty cart, but only Gristle was getting ready to pull the full one. Vothstag spewed some of his usual gibberish, gesturing at me and then towards Hamm’s empty space at the cart.

“Because I sang one line? Seriously?” I asked. I was about to throw Loewald under the bus for singing in the first place, but Vothstag was already roaring incomprehensibly. “Alright, alright. I’ll pull the damn cart.”

I handed my pickaxe over to Hamm, who instantly began swinging at the sap with manic enthusiasm. Gristle gave me a slight nod of condolence before Vothstag yoked me up to the cart like an ox and then sent us on our way with an angry shout.

“If you don’t mind me asking, how come Hamm deserves a break and you don’t?” I asked Gristle as we made our way down the track, the dinging of our colleague’s pickaxes slowly fading into the background.

Gristle looked over his shoulder to confirm the Vothstag was well out of earshot, and then turned his head towards mine.

“Vinson’s wrong, you know,” he said in a soft, conspiratorial whisper.

“Ah… I’m story?” I asked.

“About Clowns and coffee,” he clarified. “Icky drinks coffee. I’ve seen her do it. She takes it with double cream and sugar to keep it Clown Kosher, of course. She’s a little too classy to indulge in stereotypical candy binges, but she’s still got a sweet tooth like the rest of us.”

“…Us?” I asked uneasily.

Gristle nodded, lifting up his gas mask by the filter and revealing his face to me for the first time. His poreless skin was a lustrous white, but his lips, nose, and the space around his eyes were all pitch black, and the eyes themselves sparkled with the light of a thousand dying stars. His mouth was spread into an unnaturally wide smile, revealing that his teeth were not only perfect but shiny to the point that I could see myself in them.

And I looked terrified.

“Loewald was right though, about what this stuff will do to us,” he went on. “Once everything’s fully loaded, Hamm and I are going to take a mouthful each and then take the whole haul for ourselves. We’ll stash some of it away somewhere safe, then use the rest to buy our way back into the Circus. The only problem is getting there. That’s where you come in.”

“What are you on about? How can I possibly help you get back to your Circus?” I asked.

“With that Seelie coin you got in your pocket,” he said, lowering his voice so that I only barely heard him. “These carts weren’t meant to be powered manually, you know. They run on Faerie magic, and that coin’s got enough that we can drive all sixteen tons of our loot to anywhere in the worlds we want.”

I briefly considered denying that I even had the coin, but if he was determined, he could find and take it easily enough, so there really wasn’t any point.

“Ignoring for the moment how you even know I have that, why not ask Vinson?” I suggested. “He’s got way more Seelie Silver than I do.”

“He doesn’t want out. You do,” Gristle responded. “You tried to escape once, and I know you’re just itching for a chance to try again.”

“But… Ignazio knows what you are, doesn’t he? He wouldn’t have let you around the sap if he wasn’t prepared for you to try to take some,” I said.

“He doesn’t know Hamm and I can take our masks off without his say-so,” Gristle explained. “We’ve been living off meagre rations of powdered milk to keep us in line, but we were able to get a hold of a bottle of the fresh stuff and chugged it before we came here. Ignazio and Vothstag have no power over us right now.”

“… I’m sorry, milk?” I asked confused.

“Not important at the moment. Are you in or not?” he asked.

I considered his proposition for a moment, deciding on one final question before answering.    

“Why not just take the coin from me?”

“Because I’m a nice guy,” he said with a sickeningly wide grin. “And… stealing Seelie Silver tends not to end well. I don’t need an answer now. The load’s not full yet. Think about it, and when the time comes, do whatever you’ve got to do.”

He pulled his mask back down, and we finished hauling the cart over to Fish and Chips in silence.

He wasn’t wrong about me wanting to escape, but my plan had always been to quietly sneak off and be long gone before anyone noticed. A fight between Vothstag and a pair of superpowered Clowns followed by a daring getaway on an Unseelie mining cart was a bit riskier than anything I had envisioned. But at the same time, this was an unprecedented opportunity that would likely never come again.  From the Taproots of the World Tree, I could go literally anywhere, and never have to worry about Ignazio or his minions tracking me down.

All it would cost me was the single coin I had to my name.

I hauled the cart with Gristle for the rest of the shift. Eventually, we had a train of sixteen pallets, each loaded with fifty twenty-kilogram sacks of crystalized sap.

“That’s it then. Order’s full,” Vinson declared as he walked the length of the train, testing the chains to make sure the cargo was fully secured. “All of you hop in the front and let’s get the hell out of here.”

Vothstag roared in disagreement, standing between us and the cart and making a vaguely groping gesture.

“Right, right. Contraband check,” Vinson nodded with a weary sigh as he outstretched his arms. “Nothing too invasive now, you hear? If this stuff was inside of us, you’d already know it.”

Vothstag didn’t acknowledge his comment, but proceeded to pat him down and empty his pockets.

Hamm and Gristle each gave me a knowing look. If I did nothing, Vothstag would find my coin and it would all be over for me anyway. I nodded my assent, and braced myself for the worse.

With a single swift motion, Hamm and Gristle each pulled their masks off, and the visages of the two monstrous Clowns were enough to throw all of us into immediate pandemonium. Hamm’s hair, eyes, lips and nose were all a fiery red, and I saw now that the tips of their ears had a pink tinge, just like their fingers. The instant their masks were off, they wasted no time shovelling a handful of crystal sap into their mouths.

Vothstag howled and charged straight at them, and everyone else scattered as quickly as they could to avoid being bulldozed by the massive deer man. Hamm and Gristle stood their ground, each of them grabbing ahold of one of his antlers. Despite his size and speed, Vothstag was brought to a dead stop.

He snorted and bellowed as he tried to force himself forward, but he was completely unable to overpower the two Clowns. Hamm and Gristle exchanged sinister smiles and began to spin Vothstag around and around. Within seconds his feet were off the ground, and with each rotation, he gained more and more momentum until his attackers finally let go of his antlers and sent him flying into the distance.

“The rest of you, stay out of our way!” Gristle shouted as he marched towards the front cart, grabbing me by the scruff of my jacket and pulling me along with him.

“Wait, why? Why can’t they come? Why can’t we all go?” I protested.

“We don’t know what half these freaks are and we don’t trust them,” he said as he tossed me onto the cart. “Now drive. Go straight until I say otherwise.”

I looked out at my confused and frightened companions, and took a bit of solace in the fact that they weren’t entirely certain if I had betrayed them or if I was just being kidnapped. I hesitated for a moment, but Hamm’s sharp talons digging into my shoulder were enough to press me into action.

With my coin of Seelie Silver clutched in my right palm, I grabbed a firm hold of the driving shaft and pushed the train forward. It accelerated at a remarkable pace, and before I knew it, we were speeding away from our work site and towards freedom.

“It’s working. It’s actually working,” Gristle laughed in relief.

“Even Vothstag can’t run this fast!” Hamm declared triumphantly. “The whole haul is ours! We’re rich! We’re free!”

I wanted to celebrate with them. I really did. But deep down inside I knew we weren’t out of the woods yet.

“You guys read that dossier Iggy gave us, right?” I asked. “The Naught Things that gnaw the Taproots are attracted to ontological anchors – anything that’s more real than its surroundings. If you guys are reality benders, and you just ate a massive power-up, doesn’t that make you the realest things here?”

“Isn’t that cute? He thinks he knows more about ontodynamics than us because he read a dossier,” Hamm scoffed.

“This isn’t our first time on the fringes of the unreal, boy!” Gristle replied. “You just drive this train, and let us worry about –”

Without warning, the Taproot split open ahead of us into a fuming, festering chasm. The ground quake was enough to completely derail the train, and I ducked and rolled while I had the chance.

When I came out of the roll, I looked up to see a titanic, disfigured, and disembodied head rising out of the chasm. The size and proportions of the entity fluctuated wildly, as if I was only looking at the three-dimensional facets of it like the World Tree itself. It was encrusted with some kind of dark barnacles, and anything that wasn’t its face was covered in thousands of squirming and feathery tentacles of every conceivable length. It had no nose, but several mouths which chanted backwards-sounding words in synchronicity with each other, dropping rotting black teeth every time they opened and closed. 

There were six randomly spaced and variously sized eyeballs darting around independently of each other, each glowing with a sickly yellow light. I was paralyzed in fear, terrified that the Naught Thing would see me, but all six of its eyes soon locked onto Hamm and Gristle.

As it slowly ascended upwards like a hot air balloon, a pair of flickering tongues shot out of two of its mouths with predatory intent. The Clowns were scooped up like flies, screaming as they were whisked back into the Naught Thing’s cavernous maws. I don’t know much about Clowns or what they’re capable of, only that Hamm and Gristle never got a chance to test their mettle against this behemoth. A few chomps of its black teeth, and it was all over.

I sat there in silence, watching as the Naught Thing continued to drift away, never daring to assume that it had forgotten about me.

“Brandon!” I heard a voice call from the distance.

I was finally able to pull my eyes off the Naught Thing, and when I looked down the track, I saw the rest of my crew hurrying towards me.

Which included a very angry Vothstag.

Grabbing me by the jacket and lifting me off the ground, he roared furiously in my face, demanding answers.

“Easy, Vothstag, easy!” Vinson insisted. “They just grabbed the kid. It wasn’t his idea.”

Vothstag growled skeptically, eyeing the toppled train beside us. He knew it could have only been driven like that by Seelie magic, and I still had my lucky coin clutched tightly in my right hand.

“…Hamm must have picked my pocket when he was working alongside us,” Vinson suggested.

I knew he didn’t really think that. He knew exactly how many coins he had, and he knew he wasn’t missing any. I don’t know why he covered for me, but I owe him big.

“Serves him right, too. Bloody idiot,” he said with a sad shake of his head as he surveyed the wreckage. “Let this be a lesson for all of you if you ever think about stealing my Seelie Silver! That’s right, Fish and Chips, I’m looking at you!”

Vothstag howled again, clearly unconvinced.

“They took me as a driver so that they could stay focused on defending the train!” I claimed. “If I hadn’t jumped when I did, they may have stood a chance against that giant floating head! I saved our haul!”

Vothstag snorted in contempt, but set me back on my feet. I don’t think he believed me, really, but he knew that Ignazio wouldn’t hold him blameless in this little debacle either, so it was in all of our best interests not to cast aspersions on one another’s stories.

“Listen up, everybody! We’re two men down and we’ve got to get this rig back on the track before some other unspeakable abomination comes along, so get moving!” Vinson ordered.

For once, Vothstag was doing most of the work, using his might to set the carts back on the tracks, while the rest of us just picked up any sacks of sap that had come loose.

“What a bloody joke,” Loewald grumbled as he threw a sack onto a cart. “Down from nine to seven, any of us could still die at any minute, and for what? We mined sixteen tons, and what do we get?”

“Another day older,” I agreed, throwing another sack next to his. “But some days, that’s enough.”",12,1729650009.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1g9zp9h,https://i.redd.it/7jxlyszz0fwd1.jpeg,Walmart/Target Pyramid Scheme Has Made it to Knoxville!,"I was just approached by a lady named “Tammy” who tried to get my boyfriend and I to join their pyramid scheme… Thank god for Tik Tok! As soon as she asked if we were in school I immediately knew… here’s how it went:

My boyfriend and I are looking at spaghetti sauces when this lady approaches us. She compliments our curly hair and asks what products we use. While I usually get compliments when I wear my hair down my hair was in a slick back bun from the past 3 nights and the gel was starting to flake, so I thought it was odd I got a compliment with my hair in a bun..? And my boyfriend’s hair was styled so I just assumed she wanted to include me in the compliment. The lady said she wasn’t sure what to use in her kids hair implying that it was a similar texture to ours (3a-3c as we’re both mixed) and she had locs. I told her we use Camille rose and As I am and said this Walmart carries both of those in the hair section. She then asked if we were in school and I said I was. First red flag 🚩went off for me because I had remembered a Tik tok from months ago where this happened to someone in target: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP889wcXM/

Anyways she asked what major I was… ofc I had the perfect major for their pyramid scheme… marketing. She then began to ask what I wanted to do with that degree and if I enjoy my financial income atm. I said I wasn’t exactly sure what I wanted to do but I’ve been looking into it. She then tells us a story about how she’s a school teacher and she gets sick all the time by kids picking their nose and touching things and tried to relate it to marketing??? But failed. And she then was like I met these people who are financially free by 28 and quit their 9-5. Second red flag 🚩!! And went on about how she started her own e-commerce business because of them. 

She then asked if we were interested in e-commerce, my boyfriend had no idea about the pyramid scheme and thought the lady was being genuine so he was telling her how I have ran a business before and am very into entrepreneurship. I was just trying to end the conversation but she kept asking many questions and I am not the confrontational type or like to say no so I just continued with the conversation with small bland answers. She then said she’d love to go to dinner or get coffee with my boyfriend, myself, and her husband to become friends and connect. 3rd red flag 🚩 she looked 40-50 and we are very early 20s… and I remember on Tik Tok they invited the girl to dinner or coffee. 

Anyways she asks if learning e-commerce from them was something we’d be interested in and I was just like sure and gave her my number so the convo would be over. I thought about giving a wrong number but she was asking as if she was gonna shoot me the text right then and there so I was afraid of giving a fake one. After that she left and we were in Walmart for another hour and never saw her again. She sent me a text within 30-45 min of the conversation being over. I included the message. 

I forgot to add ** when the conversation was done I noticed her phone was propped up on top of her purse which had been facing us the entire time as if it might have been recording? Not sure why anyone would place it on top of a bag vertically but 🤷🏽‍♀️
She was a very sweet lady but if you haven’t heard of this before beware!!😁😁😁",8,1729649839.0,Knoxville,18,0.73,False
